2
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:39,905
This is your end, Ertuğrul.

3
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:42,425
You've brought this upon yourself...

4
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:44,425
and in so doing, destroyed your family.

5
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,745
Enough! Enough, Albastı.

6
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,705
Didn't I tell you that I wanted
both Torumtay and Ertuğrul alive?

7
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:42,225
You underestimated the might
of Hülagü Khan, Ertuğrul.

8
00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:46,985
You thought you could save
yourself by killing Alıncak.

9
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:49,705
You allied yourself to our enemies.

10
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,105
But it's over now.

11
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:58,465
I haven't said my last
words yet, Arıkbuka!

12
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:07,145
I'll gladly hear your last words one day.

13
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:17,825
Ertuğrul will never talk.

14
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:22,745
We should kill him here.
He'll cause us trouble otherwise.

15
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,425
You said Ertuğrul wasn't alone.

16
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:29,025
Death means victory for Ertuğrul.

17
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:35,425
We're taking Ertuğrul with us.

18
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:38,505
Let's go before his alps turn up.

19
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:24,825
-May I come in, sister?
-Come in, Sırma.

20
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:33,185
What are you doing, sister?

21
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,865
Gathering together Beybolat's belongings.

22
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:40,585
I don't want anything of his in this tent.

23
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:46,665
You don't have to do this, sister.

24
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:52,305
I'll have the women do it.

25
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:56,225
You look exhausted.

26
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,105
I've been noticing things.

27
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:03,545
It's obvious that a woman
now rules the tribe.

28
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,985
Much has changed.

29
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:08,225
There's much to be done.

30
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:10,785
You're right.

31
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,745
Especially considering the good news
Mother Hayme mentioned.

32
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,345
What good news?

33
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,945
What are you talking about?

34
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:21,785
What do you think
I'm talking about, sister?

35
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:24,185
I'm talking about marriage, of course.

36
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:31,745
When we are beset by
so many problems,

37
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:34,305
it is not the time
to think about such things, Sırma.

38
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:36,985
It's not wise

39
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:40,465
to postpone such auspicious
events with endless excuses.

40
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:44,985
Even if he is a traitor...

41
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:48,305
Beybolat Bey's corpse
has still not been found.

42
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:53,465
We cannot celebrate a marriage
while we wait to hold a funeral.

43
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:55,865
What would people think?

44
00:06:57,305 --> 00:07:01,105
It is beholden on us...
to wait patiently.

45
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,825
Don't put it off, sister.

46
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:05,785
Because I think Mother Hayme is right.

47
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:09,225
Don't think about my brother anymore.

48
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:12,185
It's time to look forward...

49
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:14,785
and start a family.

50
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:19,665
I agree that it's not
good to delay matters.

51
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:23,065
But Ertuğrul Bey has to have
the last word on the subject.

52
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:24,625
That's true.

53
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,105
Now that Hayme Hatun expects
Ertuğrul to marry

54
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:30,145
a woman such as yourself,

55
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,625
she will be anxious
to see you in her tent soon.

56
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:38,785
She knows very well the terrible
suffering we have been through.

57
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:43,185
Why else would she offer
such a wonderful thing

58
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:46,105
at a time when we are
assailed by so many problems?

59
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:52,185
In essence, you must marry Ertuğrul Bey
as soon as possible, sister.

60
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:55,785
After all the games our brother played...

61
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:58,945
the stain of his dishonor upon our tribe

62
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,185
can only be washed clean
by your marriage.

63
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,025
Tell the women to come
and take these away. Go on.

64
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,625
Oh Allah!

65
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:22,705
Brothers, what has happened here?

66
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:40,625
Oh Allah! Allah!

67
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:43,825
Alps, stay alert!

68
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:45,705
Is that Mergen? Mergen!

69
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:48,065
Mergen, Mergen!

70
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,145
Father! Father!

71
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:57,585
Father! Allah!

72
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:00,145
Mergen!

73
00:10:08,185 --> 00:10:09,185
Please, no!

74
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:17,665
Mergen, brother!

75
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:20,505
Father!

76
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,345
Dumrul. Dumrul!

77
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:28,945
Did you say Dumrul?

78
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,065
Is that Dumrul?

79
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:34,665
No, Dumrul.

80
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:38,705
Dumrul.

81
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:44,145
Is that Dumrul?

82
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,345
Father!

83
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,385
Dumrul.

84
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,585
Dumrul.

85
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:08,265
My Bey!

86
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,545
My Bey!

87
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,865
These are my father's!
These are my father's!

88
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:16,905
We'll find your father, son.
We'll find him.

89
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,585
Alps! Look for Ertuğrul Bey.
Search everywhere! Come on!

90
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,665
Where is Ertuğrul Bey?
Where is my brother Turgut?

91
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:41,025
Turgut!

92
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:47,185
Turgut!

93
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:50,185
Turgut!

94
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:57,505
Turgut.

95
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:00,345
-Brother Turgut! Brother Turgut!
-Turgut.

96
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:02,825
-Turgut!
-Turgut Bey. Turgut Bey.

97
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:32,345
He's alive!

98
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:36,545
Gündoğdu Bey, Gündoğdu Bey!
Turgut is alive!

99
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,025
-Turgut is alive!
-Turgut?

100
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:45,865
My strong man.
Open your eyes. Open them.

101
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:51,105
Open your eyes.
That's it! Come on.

102
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:55,665
Come on, brother. Come on.

103
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:06,665
Turgut!

104
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:10,185
Tell us. Who did this?

105
00:13:11,265 --> 00:13:14,025
Beybolat...

106
00:13:17,145 --> 00:13:19,345
Arık... Arı...

107
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,345
Arı...

108
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:30,585
Arıkbuka?

109
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:34,985
Ertuğrul. Where is Ertuğrul Bey?

110
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:40,065
Turgut Bey, Turgut Bey.
Where is my father?

111
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:42,905
Is he alive? Do you know if he lives?

112
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:48,305
Come on, come on, brother, tell us.

113
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,145
They...

114
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:53,105
caught...

115
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:55,105
him.

116
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:01,945
They'll torture him.

117
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:04,265
They'll torture my brother
to make him talk.

118
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:09,105
My Bey...

119
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:11,465
Spy...

120
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:13,785
Spy...

121
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:16,505
Berke Khan's...

122
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:17,785
spy...

123
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:19,105
His...

124
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:22,185
clothes...

125
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:26,065
Find... Find it... Find it.

126
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,625
-All right, brother, we'll find it.
-It... Find... it.

127
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:31,705
We'll find it. Alps!

128
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,105
Find the spy! Search his clothes. Go on!

129
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:38,745
Don't tire yourself, brother.
We'll patch you up.

130
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:43,465
I'll take you to Artuk Bey.
You'll be fine.

131
00:14:43,865 --> 00:14:45,985
You'll be fine. Don't exhaust yourself.

132
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,585
Brother, don't tire yourself.

133
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:14,945
Brother.

134
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,225
Selcan, daughter.

135
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:46,065
Yes, Mother.

136
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:50,665
The work is never done in the bey's tent.

137
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,105
Come and sit beside me,
let's take a breath.

138
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:05,265
You tell me to rest, Mother, but...

139
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:07,865
we'll have a marriage soon.

140
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:10,945
We should have everything
ready as soon as we can.

141
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:16,145
They say honey can be poured
from a jar which held vinegar.

142
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:21,385
İlbilge Hatun has shown that
she's an honorable woman.

143
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:27,345
Now, we must stay true to our word,
Mother, just as you commanded.

144
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:29,425
You're right.

145
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:32,105
What we must do now...

146
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:37,305
is hold a great wedding feast
for all our friends and family to enjoy.

147
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:39,065
Thankfully...

148
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:43,385
everyone has seen the Kayı tribe's
strength and the sharpness of our swords.

149
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:46,545
Now they can come
to Ertuğrul Bey's wedding feast

150
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:50,745
to see how plentiful his table is
and how generous its host can be.

151
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:54,745
I hope so, dear.

152
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,185
Mother...

153
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:02,545
Gündoğdu Bey and Gündüz
left some time ago to go to the bazaar.

154
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:06,305
Why do you think they're still not back?

155
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:08,505
Because they're not
finished yet, daughter.

156
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:09,665
They'll be back soon.

157
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:14,265
We've been busy talking,
and I forgot all about it!

158
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:18,025
I was cooking. I must take it
off the fire before it burns.

159
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:21,905
Go take care of your food.
Go on, dear.

160
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:55,545
Gündoğdu Bey.

161
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,305
Who is this Arıkbuka?

162
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:08,145
Arıkbuka is Hülagü’s best spy in Anatolia.

163
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:12,945
He's the most dangerous
Mongol I've ever heard spoken of.

164
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:16,225
Listen to me well now.

165
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,745
He'll take Ertuğrul to the brink of death
to make him tell him everything.

166
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:25,185
My bey will never talk.

167
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:29,625
Of course he won't, Bamsı, don't worry.

168
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:32,945
But it means we must act
quickly to save him.

169
00:18:58,465 --> 00:18:59,465
My Bey!

170
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,865
My Bey!

171
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:05,385
I found these documents
hidden in the lining of his clothes.

172
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,545
We must find Ertuğrul Bey.

173
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:33,105
We won't return home without him.

174
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:42,705
Wherever in this world you flee to...

175
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,625
whatever hole you hide yourself in...

176
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:48,025
I'll find you, Beybolat.

177
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:50,305
I'll kill you.

178
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,905
My Bey, we're ready to take
Turgut Bey back to the tribe.

179
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:58,185
Melikşah, listen carefully.

180
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:00,585
Tell them everything that's happened.

181
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:02,905
Have them come and take our martyrs.

182
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:05,465
Tell them Ertuğrul Bey is alive...

183
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:08,225
and that we've gone to find him.

184
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:10,945
Every member of the tribe
is to look for Ertuğrul.

185
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:12,905
Tell the other tribes too.

186
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,585
Everywhere is to be searched.
Understood?

187
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:19,185
Tell Abdurrahman to go to the Umur.

188
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:22,625
İlbilge Hatun must be told that
Beybolat is still alive.

189
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:25,505
She should be on her guard.

190
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:27,265
As you command, my Bey.

191
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:30,305
Go on, then. Allah protect you.

192
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:35,985
Chief Alp Bamsı.

193
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:39,425
Let him go.
We need to take Turgut Bey now.

194
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:47,625
Come on, Bamsı.

195
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:04,065
Come on. Come on. There he goes.

196
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:12,625
Up.

197
00:22:00,025 --> 00:22:03,345
Let's go. Let's go, alps.
To the horses! Quickly! Let's go!

198
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:31,385
Not on the ground.
Put his back against the wall.

199
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:33,185
He can stay like that until he wakes.

200
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:53,185
Red wine.

201
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:11,265
Red wine refreshes a man
who has just spilled blood.

202
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,385
It can refresh you, then.

203
00:23:14,545 --> 00:23:18,305
After all this bloodshed,
the Kayı Tribe will mourn.

204
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:23,025
We've taken their bey.
We killed their most important alps.

205
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:28,665
Why am I here, Albastı?

206
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:31,385
I salute the enemy with blood.

207
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,345
They respond with screams of fear.

208
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:39,785
A sword unties all knots
just as blood unties the tongue.

209
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:43,785
Ertuğrul is a tough one, be warned.

210
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:49,105
Did you spend too long
in Ertuğrul's lands and...

211
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,345
forget about the past, Albastı?

212
00:23:53,505 --> 00:23:58,065
Do you have any idea how many times
I've made tough men like him talk?

213
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:15,385
That tongues hides Keykavus,
the chest, the gold,

214
00:24:16,265 --> 00:24:19,025
and the secret deal with Berke Khan.

215
00:24:20,145 --> 00:24:22,345
If you know how to dig...

216
00:24:23,785 --> 00:24:25,705
you will find treasure.

217
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,985
I'll make him give me everything.

218
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:30,905
Everything he knows.

219
00:24:31,945 --> 00:24:35,385
Just take your treasure and
leave the rest to me.

220
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:42,425
I'll bury him in the hole you've dug
once vengeance is mine.

221
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:26,505
Did they grow wings and fly, my Bey?

222
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:30,065
Their tracks end here.

223
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,985
Hülagü's most skilled warriors and spies
are under Arıkbuka's command.

224
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:51,425
He must know we were following them.
They've hidden their tracks.

225
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:55,265
So what do we do, my Bey?
How will we find my father?

226
00:25:56,745 --> 00:26:00,185
Bamsı, you know this place best.
Tell us.

227
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:01,905
All right, my Bey.

228
00:26:02,505 --> 00:26:03,985
We are here.

229
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:08,025
When Melikşah tells the tribe what's
happened, the alps will search the forest.

230
00:26:09,385 --> 00:26:13,225
The others will search
Mount Semadirek and Mount Papaz.

231
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,865
My Bey, we will take this valley.

232
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:18,945
Where does it lead?

233
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:22,145
It divides into two,
one leading into Byzantine lands

234
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:23,985
and the other down to the river, my Bey.

235
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:25,985
We'll split up to search.

236
00:26:27,345 --> 00:26:28,425
Understood.

237
00:26:28,585 --> 00:26:30,265
We'll search the whole valley.

238
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:34,985
Gündüz, take the side
on the right with Günkut.

239
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:39,665
Bamsı, you and the alps
will take the left with me.

240
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:41,105
Very good, my Bey.

241
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:44,345
We'll continue through into the night.
No sleeping!

242
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:47,025
Sooner or later we will find Ertuğrul Bey.

243
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,465
Understood?

244
00:26:48,585 --> 00:26:50,425
-As you command, my Bey!
-As you command, my Bey!

245
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:52,065
We'll search with torches.

246
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:55,385
When they see the light from the torches
they'll come out and reveal themselves.

247
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:57,665
I hope so, my Bey. I hope so.

248
00:26:57,745 --> 00:27:00,585
I hope they do, so that
we can kill them and save our bey.

249
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,865
God willing. Let's go! Let's go, brothers!

250
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:15,025
Come on!

251
00:27:27,825 --> 00:27:31,745
Even if Ertuğrul dies, Gündoğdu
will continue from where he left off.

252
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:36,025
We'll have to take care of him
if we want to avoid further trouble.

253
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:42,505
Your fear of the Kayıs can be seen in
your eyes and heard in your words.

254
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:47,865
I already know what to do
and to whom, don't worry.

255
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:49,705
Is that so?

256
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:51,705
What will you do?

257
00:27:52,025 --> 00:27:56,425
To destroy the alliance
they made with Berke Khan,

258
00:27:56,825 --> 00:28:00,825
and to put an end to their endless
plots and conspiracies in Anatolia,

259
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:03,145
I will take Gündoğdu.

260
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:07,865
It is not enough to catch the eagle.

261
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:12,065
Not when there's chicks in its nest.
That nest must be destroyed

262
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:14,665
so those chicks don't become eagles.

263
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:22,985
He's stretching his wings.

264
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:40,465
It seems Hülagü Khan no longer values you.

265
00:28:44,745 --> 00:28:46,985
Knowing I've killed
all the Mongols here...

266
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:49,945
he sent you to me.

267
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:59,745
My favorite enemy is the one
who is brave even in captivity.

268
00:29:01,705 --> 00:29:05,425
I don't like the easy ones anyway.

269
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:12,025
It will give me great pleasure
to peel away your courage, layer by layer,

270
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:14,465
by hurting you, Ertuğrul.

271
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:26,145
So, you found another master to
hold your leash, Albastı.

272
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:30,185
Now raise your tail and bark.

273
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:34,945
Because I plan to cut it off.

274
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:44,145
When I had your nephew Süleyman,
he talked like that too.

275
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:51,105
But when I crushed his head
in the lion's jaw,

276
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:53,465
he spoke a lot less, Ertuğrul.

277
00:29:55,105 --> 00:29:56,625
I remember it clearly.

278
00:29:57,385 --> 00:30:00,225
It makes me happy whenever I think of it.

279
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:06,505
I figured you out very quickly, Ertuğrul.

280
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:08,225
But...

281
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:15,145
you should understand how I work too.

282
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,865
When my darkness falls...

283
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,945
the mountains are mine.

284
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:24,745
You cannot escape...

285
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:27,865
and no one will save you.

286
00:30:29,185 --> 00:30:30,265
That's why...

287
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:34,065
you should give me what I want, easily.

288
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,305
You say you know me.

289
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:43,305
But they clearly didn't tell you enough.

290
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:55,265
Even if the mountains are yours...

291
00:30:55,905 --> 00:30:57,545
you'll never control me.

292
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:10,265
Finally!

293
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:14,025
You finally made me bleed, Ertuğrul.

294
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,825
This means we really are enemies now.

295
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:21,865
I won't leave a single drop in your body.

296
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,585
Arıkbuka...

297
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:28,545
let's crush him now
to show him his mistake.

298
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:30,305
You have spilled so much blood...

299
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:34,665
but you still haven't
learned to enjoy it, Albastı.

300
00:31:41,505 --> 00:31:45,145
You must see your enemy
die slowly in agony.

301
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:49,185
You must make it last so that...

302
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:53,185
as the words pour out of him...

303
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:57,265
so the blood empties from his body.

304
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:03,785
Bring the torture fork!

305
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:50,474
Who is this coming?

306
00:32:58,474 --> 00:32:59,714
Let it be good news.

307
00:33:12,514 --> 00:33:13,914
It's the alps, Mother.

308
00:33:14,874 --> 00:33:16,474
There's someone behind them.

309
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:17,954
What's going on?

310
00:33:18,674 --> 00:33:20,434
They're carrying a wounded man.

311
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:23,194
A wounded man?

312
00:33:30,914 --> 00:33:32,154
Stand aside.

313
00:33:46,754 --> 00:33:47,914
Turgut Bey!

314
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:51,594
Turgut!

315
00:33:51,954 --> 00:33:53,114
Mother!

316
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:54,994
Turgut!

317
00:33:55,554 --> 00:33:58,074
My son! My son! What happened?

318
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,794
Son, what happened?

319
00:34:11,914 --> 00:34:13,514
What happened? Artuk Bey!

320
00:34:13,874 --> 00:34:15,034
İlçin Hatun!

321
00:34:15,394 --> 00:34:16,874
Turgut is badly wounded!

322
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:18,874
You must tend to him immediately!

323
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:21,434
Take him to the healing tent.

324
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:22,954
-Hurry!
-Come on.

325
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:24,954
-Come on.
-Come on!

326
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:42,554
Who did this?

327
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:44,514
There was a fight, Mother Hayme.

328
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:47,354
We have many martyrs.

329
00:34:50,194 --> 00:34:51,954
Dumrul and Mergen are dead.

330
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:54,514
What did you say?

331
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,314
Where is Ertuğrul Bey?

332
00:35:18,274 --> 00:35:19,754
I asked you a question, Melikşah!

333
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:22,554
Where is your bey?

334
00:35:23,714 --> 00:35:24,914
Ertuğrul Bey...

335
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:27,634
was captured and taken, Mother Hayme.

336
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:30,274
Father.

337
00:35:43,714 --> 00:35:44,794
Gündoğdu Bey and...

338
00:35:45,314 --> 00:35:47,554
Gündüz Alp have gone to find Ertuğrul Bey.

339
00:36:02,234 --> 00:36:03,554
Raise your head, Melikşah.

340
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:08,074
We don't bow our heads.

341
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:10,754
We take heads!

342
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,074
Who did this?

343
00:36:14,954 --> 00:36:15,914
Beybolat.

344
00:36:24,234 --> 00:36:26,114
Isn't that bastard dead?

345
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:32,434
No, Selcan Hatun.
He ambushed us with the Mongols.

346
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,274
Brave Kayı men!

347
00:36:41,754 --> 00:36:42,954
And brave women!

348
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:46,194
Listen to me.

349
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:52,954
Now is not the time to cry and despair.

350
00:36:56,194 --> 00:37:00,554
Whenever we were in trouble,
our bey ran to help us.

351
00:37:01,114 --> 00:37:02,714
Now we will help him!

352
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:04,834
-Yes, she's right!
-Yes!

353
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:06,554
Alps of the tribe!

354
00:37:07,354 --> 00:37:09,554
Go and search for your bey!

355
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:12,434
Women of the tribe!

356
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:18,074
Take up your weapons
and get yourselves ready for battle!

357
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:20,234
If...

358
00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:22,514
those bastards...

359
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:26,194
dare to attack our village...

360
00:37:27,194 --> 00:37:28,794
we will fight to the death.

361
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:33,274
We will fight until the last drop of blood
falls from our bodies! We will fight!

362
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:37,154
-We will fight!
-We will fight!

363
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:39,194
Come on!

364
00:37:58,314 --> 00:38:01,634
Make some healing balm, İlçin Hatun.
We must cover the wound.

365
00:38:03,874 --> 00:38:07,274
-The bleeding won't stop, Artuk Bey!
-Wipe it clean with the cloths you boiled.

366
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:10,234
Prepare the branding iron.
We'll cauterize it.

367
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:16,914
How is he, Artuk Bey?

368
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:19,194
Will Turgut live?

369
00:38:19,274 --> 00:38:22,674
We'll cauterize the wound,
Hayme Hatun. But it's deep.

370
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:29,554
The traitor who did this
stabbed him in this area

371
00:38:29,634 --> 00:38:31,394
so as to inflict maximum suffering.

372
00:38:33,674 --> 00:38:35,714
It was Beybolat who stabbed him.

373
00:38:44,514 --> 00:38:47,554
-The iron is ready, my Bey.
-Excuse us, Hayme Hatun.

374
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:50,274
Bring it over, İlçin Hatun.

375
00:38:57,154 --> 00:38:58,634
Be very careful now.

376
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,514
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

377
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:05,594
<i>Ya Şafi.</i>

378
00:39:06,874 --> 00:39:08,114
<i>Ya Şafi.</i>

379
00:39:08,194 --> 00:39:09,954
-Allah.
-<i>Ya Şafi.</i>

380
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:11,554
Help us, Allah.

381
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:16,914
<i>Ya Şafi.</i>

382
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:18,994
<i>Ya Şafi.</i>

383
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:32,234
Does your neck hurt, Ertuğrul?

384
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:35,354
If you try to lower your head,

385
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,234
or if you fall asleep and your head falls,

386
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,914
the fork will stick
in your throat and kill you.

387
00:39:43,234 --> 00:39:46,474
But then, if you stay like this,
the pain will drive you insane.

388
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:51,954
So I have given you two options,
pain or death.

389
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:55,194
Speak and be saved.

390
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:57,834
What you call death...

391
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:00,914
I call martyrdom.

392
00:40:02,154 --> 00:40:05,594
Anything you try to scare me with
only gives me courage.

393
00:40:07,994 --> 00:40:09,194
If you want...

394
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:12,434
you can tear me apart.

395
00:40:14,594 --> 00:40:18,274
You won't see any pain in my face.

396
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:21,034
I, however...

397
00:40:21,914 --> 00:40:23,634
will get to watch you go mad...

398
00:40:24,794 --> 00:40:27,074
for failing to bend me to your will.

399
00:40:28,074 --> 00:40:31,034
What glorious words.

400
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:39,834
But not the words I wanted to hear.

401
00:40:41,794 --> 00:40:46,034
You will tell me what
you took from Alıncak.

402
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:48,114
His life?

403
00:40:49,274 --> 00:40:50,794
I fed him to the vultures.

404
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:55,914
You're only tormenting yourself
by stretching this out.

405
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:57,834
Tell me...

406
00:40:58,394 --> 00:41:00,594
what are you planning with Berke Khan?

407
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:03,594
How is Sultan Keykavus involved?

408
00:41:04,154 --> 00:41:05,674
What's inside the chest?

409
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:10,474
If you want to know... go after it.

410
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:12,954
But...

411
00:41:13,714 --> 00:41:16,794
your fate will be the same
as all the others who tried to find it.

412
00:41:19,074 --> 00:41:21,714
Your fingers have been
the ones pulling the strings.

413
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:23,754
I'll break those fingers...

414
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:27,594
one by one.

415
00:41:28,874 --> 00:41:31,954
But you can't have
done it all by yourself.

416
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:35,234
There's a great power behind you.

417
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,354
Who is that?

418
00:41:40,074 --> 00:41:42,834
True. There is.

419
00:41:46,594 --> 00:41:47,634
My God.

420
00:41:49,354 --> 00:41:50,474
My heart.

421
00:41:51,514 --> 00:41:52,634
My sword.

422
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:15,834
And the gold?
What happened to it?

423
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,194
Did you send the gold that rightfully
belonged to the Mongols to Berke Khan?

424
00:42:21,114 --> 00:42:23,354
Even if I knew where it was
I wouldn't tell you...

425
00:42:24,674 --> 00:42:26,074
I'd tell Arıkbuka.

426
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:31,554
But then you'd try to kill him
to get the gold anyway.

427
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:37,554
Just like you tried to kill Alıncak.

428
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:47,834
What are these black words
scratching at my ear?

429
00:42:48,954 --> 00:42:50,674
Are you not going to tell him...

430
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:55,434
that when we caught Alıncak,
the first arrow to hit him was yours?

431
00:42:57,154 --> 00:43:00,434
Are you going to deny
trying to kill him, Albastı?

432
00:43:04,154 --> 00:43:06,994
He's right. I did.

433
00:43:08,234 --> 00:43:10,994
I did it to prevent
Alıncak being taken captive.

434
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:14,314
So that he couldn't expose our secrets.

435
00:43:15,674 --> 00:43:18,594
Anyone in my place
would have done the same.

436
00:43:19,754 --> 00:43:23,314
If Alıncak could be resurrected,
he'd thank me.

437
00:43:24,314 --> 00:43:25,434
You know that.

438
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:36,394
A true and honest word...

439
00:43:37,634 --> 00:43:39,954
cuts as sharply as a knife.

440
00:43:41,194 --> 00:43:43,194
The arrow you fired at him

441
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:45,634
pierced my heart too.

442
00:43:56,074 --> 00:43:58,794
But... you're right.

443
00:44:00,714 --> 00:44:02,314
If you had let him live,

444
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:06,474
and left him to the enemy,
that would have been a crime.

445
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:18,594
It's clear that making you talk

446
00:44:19,434 --> 00:44:22,514
will be as difficult as
turning steel into dust.

447
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,874
But my strength has no limits.

448
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:33,234
You will writhe in agony
until the moment you run out of blood.

449
00:45:24,554 --> 00:45:26,834
Welcome, Abdurrahman Alp. What is it?

450
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:28,674
Thank you, İlbilge Hatun.

451
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:31,394
What is it? Is it something important?

452
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:37,274
İlbilge Hatun, I'd rather
discuss this with you in your tent.

453
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:44,954
All right, come in.

454
00:45:58,154 --> 00:46:00,874
-Go on. I'm listening.
-İlbilge Hatun...

455
00:46:03,154 --> 00:46:05,714
Ertuğrul Bey and our alps were ambushed.

456
00:46:07,074 --> 00:46:09,474
An ambush? What happened?

457
00:46:11,514 --> 00:46:13,074
We lost many alps.

458
00:46:14,954 --> 00:46:17,314
Ertuğrul Bey was captured
and taken by the enemy.

459
00:46:18,314 --> 00:46:19,434
What enemy?

460
00:46:20,514 --> 00:46:21,474
Albastı.

461
00:46:28,314 --> 00:46:29,274
Albastı?

462
00:46:42,954 --> 00:46:45,874
How could he fall down a cliff
with that wound and survive?

463
00:46:46,634 --> 00:46:48,274
Mongol spies saved him.

464
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:51,914
They were the ones
who attacked Ertuğrul Bey.

465
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:53,834
They have Ertuğrul Bey now.

466
00:46:54,954 --> 00:46:56,594
What are you saying, Abdurrahman Alp?

467
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:01,394
He heaps more shame upon us.

468
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,314
I'll make him pay for this.

469
00:47:05,954 --> 00:47:09,594
Gündoğdu Bey went after them.
He'll find them sooner or later.

470
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:11,954
We'll remain with your tribe for now.

471
00:47:12,314 --> 00:47:15,074
Then we'll join
the search for Ertuğrul Bey.

472
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:18,874
Do not talk of this to anyone for now.

473
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,634
I'll increase the number of guards.

474
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:44,074
Allah, protect Ertuğrul Bey from evil.

475
00:47:57,714 --> 00:48:01,314
Our scouts sent word. They've seen
the Kayıs searching the forest.

476
00:48:04,954 --> 00:48:06,034
Brother.

477
00:48:06,594 --> 00:48:07,754
Gündoğdu.

478
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:12,714
It is so much easier to hunt
when my prey comes running to me.

479
00:48:13,234 --> 00:48:15,154
Shall we go back and surround them?

480
00:48:15,234 --> 00:48:16,314
No need.

481
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:20,354
We'll set the trap and wait for them here.

482
00:48:21,074 --> 00:48:25,594
When Gündoğdu gets close enough,
we'll attack them.

483
00:48:25,954 --> 00:48:28,114
You hide in your holes...

484
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:30,994
like the cowardly jackals you are.

485
00:48:33,394 --> 00:48:34,394
Neither I...

486
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:38,034
nor my brother,
will ever fall into your traps.

487
00:48:39,314 --> 00:48:40,954
Don't push yourself, Ertuğrul.

488
00:48:42,074 --> 00:48:44,554
That fork might pierce
your throat and you'll die.

489
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:46,914
And that would make me so sad.

490
00:48:47,274 --> 00:48:49,234
I still need you.

491
00:48:51,314 --> 00:48:54,954
No one will ever find us
unless we want them to find us.

492
00:48:56,994 --> 00:49:00,754
Leave something that will
lead Gündoğdu to us.

493
00:49:01,114 --> 00:49:05,994
Leave it at such a place that
they'll reach here at the red dawn.

494
00:49:07,394 --> 00:49:08,834
What should I leave for them?

495
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:11,154
It must be something they will recognize.

496
00:49:33,514 --> 00:49:35,914
When your brother finds a piece of you,

497
00:49:36,714 --> 00:49:38,594
I wonder how quickly he'll get here.

498
00:49:41,714 --> 00:49:43,714
To find out whether you're dead or alive

499
00:49:44,154 --> 00:49:46,554
he'll rush here as if he's lost his mind.

500
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,234
You're only inviting...

501
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,914
your own death.

502
00:49:54,674 --> 00:49:58,714
It's my job to play with death.

503
00:50:01,954 --> 00:50:04,114
Let's leave him a sign then.

504
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:09,234
A bloody piece of you.

505
00:50:36,314 --> 00:50:38,074
This is the piece.

506
00:50:38,954 --> 00:50:40,834
And now, some blood.

507
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:53,234
Do it like I said.
Choose the location wisely,

508
00:50:53,994 --> 00:50:56,634
I don't want them
getting here before dawn.

509
00:51:01,234 --> 00:51:05,594
It's time to get some
sleep before my prey arrives.

510
00:51:44,914 --> 00:51:46,474
May I come in, sister?

511
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:49,394
Come in, Sırma.

512
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:59,674
What's going on, sister? You've
posted additional guards everywhere.

513
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:02,234
The usual precautions, Sırma.

514
00:52:05,274 --> 00:52:06,514
Nothing for you to worry about.

515
00:52:07,354 --> 00:52:10,474
Abdurrahman and other Kayı alps
being here is not usual, sister.

516
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:14,314
What's going on? I have a right to know.

517
00:52:16,754 --> 00:52:17,834
Ertuğrul Bey.

518
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:21,314
What about Ertuğrul Bey?
Has something happened to him?

519
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:25,714
Ertuğrul Bey has been captured.

520
00:52:29,234 --> 00:52:33,314
The entire frontier is on alert.
That's why I've taken extra precautions.

521
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:38,434
Who would dare do something like this?
Who could capture Ertuğrul Bey?

522
00:52:41,114 --> 00:52:42,034
The Mongols.

523
00:52:45,194 --> 00:52:46,314
The Mongols?

524
00:52:48,834 --> 00:52:52,834
-How do you know?
-Abdurrahman Alp told me, Sırma.

525
00:53:00,034 --> 00:53:01,114
What will we do?

526
00:53:06,594 --> 00:53:08,034
I'll do whatever's necessary.

527
00:53:11,194 --> 00:53:13,354
You should continue
to attend to your work.

528
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:14,994
As you wish, sister.

529
00:54:34,394 --> 00:54:36,394
You pursued the wrong things, Ertuğrul.

530
00:54:38,714 --> 00:54:42,994
If you had been on the right side,
the Mongols wouldn't be here and...

531
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:46,034
you wouldn't be in this state.

532
00:54:46,874 --> 00:54:48,794
I would sacrifice my life

533
00:54:49,834 --> 00:54:52,314
to remain true to my cause, Albastı.

534
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:59,554
Those who have set you on this course
will lead our state into the abyss.

535
00:55:00,594 --> 00:55:04,954
They will destroy it,
and traitors like you will help them.

536
00:55:12,514 --> 00:55:17,234
I knew the state
before I knew my father, Ertuğrul.

537
00:55:19,994 --> 00:55:24,194
There is no place
I've not fought, bled and killed...

538
00:55:24,834 --> 00:55:26,754
for this state.

539
00:55:27,914 --> 00:55:29,034
I've even put up with...

540
00:55:31,714 --> 00:55:33,194
the Mongols for it.

541
00:55:34,314 --> 00:55:36,114
And you think I will destroy it?

542
00:55:37,274 --> 00:55:38,394
This state...

543
00:55:39,594 --> 00:55:43,914
didn't raise the kind of traitor who would
raise his sword against his own people.

544
00:55:46,874 --> 00:55:48,554
Those who you believe are the state...

545
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:51,874
are the wolves who gnaw at the tree.

546
00:55:52,794 --> 00:55:55,474
I put my back against that tree
to keep it from toppling.

547
00:55:57,234 --> 00:55:59,234
My bones cracked under the burden.

548
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:04,034
I've put up with everything to save it
from being crushed under Mongol boots.

549
00:56:07,794 --> 00:56:10,434
It's those who you
believe to be the state

550
00:56:11,154 --> 00:56:13,314
who left us all alone, Ertuğrul.

551
00:56:14,274 --> 00:56:15,554
A jackal can't lead

552
00:56:16,314 --> 00:56:18,994
a pack of wolves, Albastı.

553
00:56:21,994 --> 00:56:26,554
Because you chose treachery
and put your own pride above everything,

554
00:56:27,474 --> 00:56:28,714
you now stand alone.

555
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:33,994
You now run with hyenas.

556
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:37,594
But...

557
00:56:38,874 --> 00:56:40,314
remember that...

558
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:45,274
when the haze clears from the field...

559
00:56:46,234 --> 00:56:48,874
all you will see will be our claws.

560
00:56:51,714 --> 00:56:53,114
Who are you, Ertuğrul?

561
00:56:59,594 --> 00:57:01,074
Who is the power behind you?

562
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:09,114
Scorpion.

563
00:57:27,674 --> 00:57:29,274
A scorpion approaches.

564
00:57:45,074 --> 00:57:46,994
How did you know that
that scorpion was there?

565
00:57:49,994 --> 00:57:53,074
Being strong isn't just a matter of being
tough, you also have to be sensitive.

566
00:57:55,954 --> 00:57:59,154
Sensitive enough to sense a scorpion
coming towards you while you sleep.

567
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:03,994
The sky god Tengri made even
the deadliest creatures

568
00:58:04,074 --> 00:58:06,034
useful for something.

569
00:58:08,714 --> 00:58:10,794
This scorpion will help us.

570
00:58:27,594 --> 00:58:29,474
Our men left the scrap of clothing.

571
00:58:29,554 --> 00:58:32,634
Good, then a feast of blood
awaits us after dawn.

572
00:58:34,434 --> 00:58:35,634
Take this scorpion.

573
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:38,594
Extract its poison.

574
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:42,794
When Gündoğdu arrives
it might prove useful to me.

575
00:58:57,554 --> 00:59:00,074
You'll soon be seeing
your brother, Ertuğrul.

576
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:12,394
And you'll be seeing your
blood brother Alıncak soon.

577
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:17,114
There will indeed be
blood after the red dawn.

578
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:20,954
Swords will determine who drowns in it.

579
00:59:21,714 --> 00:59:24,634
True. But you won't be here to see it.

580
00:59:27,594 --> 00:59:30,114
Take him and leave before dawn.

581
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:34,154
Go to my secret cave and wait there.

582
00:59:36,234 --> 00:59:39,514
Just in case.
He must not be here during the fight.

583
00:59:44,234 --> 00:59:48,194
I'll lure Gündoğdu here and trap him.

584
00:59:50,474 --> 00:59:53,234
Will you still not speak, Ertuğrul?

585
00:59:54,394 --> 00:59:59,034
Speak, to prevent your brother
being tortured like you.

586
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:02,274
The power that could make me speak
has not yet been born.

587
01:00:04,274 --> 01:00:07,594
The torture that could break me
has not yet been devised.

588
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:11,434
You can hold your head up now.

589
01:00:12,034 --> 01:00:14,754
But what will you do when you
become tired?

590
01:01:06,594 --> 01:01:08,194
Show us their tracks.

591
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:11,394
Allah, show us their tracks.

592
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:17,474
Allah, show us their tracks,
show us their tracks, Allah.

593
01:01:18,994 --> 01:01:20,394
Where are you, my bey?

594
01:01:24,394 --> 01:01:25,994
My bey, my bey.

595
01:01:27,034 --> 01:01:28,234
My bey!

596
01:01:34,354 --> 01:01:37,594
No, no. There's no sign of them.

597
01:01:37,914 --> 01:01:41,794
No tracks! Nothing!
There's no sign of them!

598
01:01:42,714 --> 01:01:44,514
My bey is gone and there are no tracks.

599
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:46,154
Bamsı.

600
01:01:47,554 --> 01:01:48,874
Gündoğdu Bey.

601
01:01:50,314 --> 01:01:52,794
We're just wandering around in the dark.

602
01:01:57,154 --> 01:01:59,194
I know we can't give up.

603
01:01:59,914 --> 01:02:01,834
-I do, my bey, but--
-But...

604
01:02:03,514 --> 01:02:06,394
The dawn inevitably follows night.

605
01:02:08,594 --> 01:02:09,914
Isn't that right, brother?

606
01:02:10,434 --> 01:02:13,234
We can't give up hope now,
we won't give up hope.

607
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:17,154
Very good, my bey. Very good.

608
01:02:18,074 --> 01:02:20,314
I won't give up. I won't give up, my bey.

609
01:02:21,634 --> 01:02:22,914
Someone's coming, my bey!

610
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:29,314
Gündoğdu Bey! Gündoğdu Bey!

611
01:02:30,034 --> 01:02:31,474
Gündüz Bey's found something.

612
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:34,714
Good. Let's go, quickly!

613
01:02:35,234 --> 01:02:38,834
My Bey, the dawn is inevitable,
just as you said, my Bey.

614
01:02:39,114 --> 01:02:40,674
Allah willing, let's go! Let's go!

615
01:06:40,794 --> 01:06:41,754
Welcome, Turgut.

616
01:06:43,114 --> 01:06:44,474
Where am I?

617
01:06:48,834 --> 01:06:50,074
Where am I, <i>Hodja</i>?

618
01:06:55,794 --> 01:06:57,994
You're far away and you're close.

619
01:06:59,354 --> 01:07:02,274
It is neither yesterday, nor tomorrow.

620
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:05,874
You're here, Turgut.

621
01:07:10,794 --> 01:07:11,874
Why...

622
01:07:16,034 --> 01:07:17,674
Why are you planting a rose?

623
01:07:19,274 --> 01:07:20,994
I was told we have many martyrs.

624
01:07:22,394 --> 01:07:25,434
I'm planting roses along their path.

625
01:07:44,434 --> 01:07:45,474
Did I...

626
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:48,394
become a martyr?

627
01:07:55,634 --> 01:07:57,634
A martyr is a witness.

628
01:07:58,914 --> 01:08:03,314
If you don't know what you're
witnessing, then this is not your time.

629
01:08:04,754 --> 01:08:09,954
When you see it,
you won't have any questions.

630
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:13,234
That is, instead of asking questions,

631
01:08:13,874 --> 01:08:17,314
you'll simply enjoy the gifts of Allah.

632
01:08:43,474 --> 01:08:44,634
They won't bloom...

633
01:08:46,594 --> 01:08:49,394
until their time comes, Turgut.

634
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:52,074
What does that mean?

635
01:08:53,234 --> 01:08:56,674
Your roots are still to be
buried and watered.

636
01:08:58,194 --> 01:09:02,194
A rose will grow tall and bloom
in caring hands,

637
01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:06,274
but those who seek
to uproot it will feel its thorns.

638
01:09:22,154 --> 01:09:26,314
You were once a heartbroken,
orphaned child.

639
01:09:27,274 --> 01:09:31,674
Allah raised you up,
and made you his warrior.

640
01:09:35,434 --> 01:09:38,914
You became an alp,
and then rose to become bey.

641
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:42,034
Most importantly of all,

642
01:09:42,674 --> 01:09:45,834
you shed your blood on the battlefield
in the wars against our oppressors.

643
01:09:47,394 --> 01:09:49,194
There will be more battles to fight,

644
01:09:50,474 --> 01:09:52,474
and more tyrants to kill.

645
01:09:54,434 --> 01:09:58,114
As there are still those
who would seek to uproot Allah's cause,

646
01:09:58,554 --> 01:10:02,114
it falls upon you to pierce
their skin with your thorns.

647
01:10:10,554 --> 01:10:11,874
I have killed many enemies...

648
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:15,794
on the field of battle.

649
01:10:18,474 --> 01:10:19,434
But...

650
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:23,434
this time I am very
badly wounded, my teacher.

651
01:10:24,074 --> 01:10:25,314
What plant or medicine

652
01:10:26,554 --> 01:10:28,674
could heal me this time?

653
01:10:30,474 --> 01:10:31,994
Medicine and plants

654
01:10:33,194 --> 01:10:34,914
are only the means, Turgut.

655
01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:38,434
Nothing happens without Allah's will.

656
01:10:39,154 --> 01:10:40,954
Abraham was thrown into fire.

657
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:45,034
Fire so hot it would melt steel.

658
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:50,314
But because Allah did not wish it,
the fire didn't burn Abraham.

659
01:10:52,154 --> 01:10:56,114
The knife would have
cleaved a tree in two.

660
01:10:57,314 --> 01:11:02,234
But since Allah did not wish it,
the knife did not cut Isaac.

661
01:11:04,554 --> 01:11:06,594
Now, without Allah's will...

662
01:11:08,154 --> 01:11:10,634
that wound cannot kill you.

663
01:11:17,474 --> 01:11:18,674
Come, Turgut.

664
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:25,714
Drink some water.

665
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:29,314
Refresh your roots.

666
01:11:44,794 --> 01:11:45,994
Water is mercy.

667
01:11:47,514 --> 01:11:48,754
It's a blessing.

668
01:11:49,754 --> 01:11:53,274
It is clean and it cleanses.

669
01:11:54,754 --> 01:11:56,114
It heals.

670
01:12:02,154 --> 01:12:06,154
The name "Hayy" means,
"he who gives life to everything".

671
01:12:09,594 --> 01:12:12,114
Drink in his name, Turgut.

672
01:12:16,314 --> 01:12:18,434
Drink in his name.

673
01:12:22,914 --> 01:12:25,034
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

674
01:12:27,314 --> 01:12:28,794
Hayy!

675
01:12:41,154 --> 01:12:45,474
Oh Allah, you bring the day and the night.

676
01:12:46,634 --> 01:12:50,274
You light up the sky with the stars.

677
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:53,274
With your unlimited power,

678
01:12:54,314 --> 01:12:56,994
you can create anything.

679
01:12:58,594 --> 01:13:00,674
You help with our hardships.

680
01:13:02,114 --> 01:13:04,954
You have a solution for every problem.

681
01:13:06,834 --> 01:13:09,114
Everything belongs to you.

682
01:13:10,914 --> 01:13:16,714
When Eyyub was hurt, his family
feared that he would never recover

683
01:13:17,234 --> 01:13:19,594
from such grievous wounds.

684
01:13:20,514 --> 01:13:23,794
But Eyyub himself did not give up hope

685
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:27,274
and reached out to you.

686
01:13:28,314 --> 01:13:31,994
You were the one who healed him.

687
01:13:32,714 --> 01:13:34,554
Now heal this brave man

688
01:13:35,794 --> 01:13:37,874
who was willing to give his life...

689
01:13:38,954 --> 01:13:42,674
in the fight for your holy cause.

690
01:13:44,114 --> 01:13:45,194
You said...

691
01:13:46,274 --> 01:13:51,234
"Pray to me so that I may answer".

692
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:57,794
Please answer our prayers,
in the name of your messenger,

693
01:13:58,114 --> 01:14:01,354
Muhammad.

694
01:14:02,034 --> 01:14:04,394
Please, accept our prayers,

695
01:14:05,314 --> 01:14:07,714
and in your wisdom act upon them.

696
01:14:09,274 --> 01:14:10,914
Accept them, oh Allah!

697
01:14:12,634 --> 01:14:13,714
Accept them!

698
01:14:15,794 --> 01:14:16,754
Amen.

699
01:15:02,725 --> 01:15:04,245
What is it, my brave man,
what have you found?

700
01:15:04,445 --> 01:15:05,525
My bey...

701
01:15:08,005 --> 01:15:09,725
this is a piece of my father's kaftan.

702
01:15:13,045 --> 01:15:14,045
You are right.

703
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:16,165
It's one of our fabrics.

704
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:21,685
However, somebody might have planted this
to lead us in the wrong direction.

705
01:15:23,765 --> 01:15:28,125
My bey, we cannot know for sure
unless we follow the tracks to the end.

706
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:29,805
Certainly, we'll follow them.

707
01:15:30,085 --> 01:15:31,325
We will follow them.

708
01:16:34,205 --> 01:16:35,205
My God...

709
01:16:37,365 --> 01:16:38,365
you are the one...

710
01:16:39,765 --> 01:16:41,765
with power and might.

711
01:16:44,925 --> 01:16:47,605
Don't let us yield to our enemies.

712
01:16:50,045 --> 01:16:51,645
If it's not your wish...

713
01:16:53,045 --> 01:16:54,765
a life won't leave a body.

714
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,805
In your path...

715
01:16:59,045 --> 01:17:01,325
I have no fear of death.

716
01:17:11,885 --> 01:17:14,405
Grant me the opportunity
to avenge our martyrs...

717
01:17:18,045 --> 01:17:21,725
and make them pay
for killing my brothers.

718
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:50,085
<i>May I enter, İlbilge Hatun?</i>

719
01:17:51,205 --> 01:17:52,605
Come in, Abdurrahman Alp.

720
01:17:59,645 --> 01:18:00,725
Are the horses ready?

721
01:18:01,165 --> 01:18:02,365
They are, İlbilge Hatun.

722
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:05,045
We will go out to look.

723
01:18:05,645 --> 01:18:06,645
Good.

724
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:08,765
I shall come with you.

725
01:18:10,405 --> 01:18:11,405
İlbilge Hatun...

726
01:18:12,365 --> 01:18:15,565
it would be better if you stayed
at the camp for the tribe's sake.

727
01:18:16,165 --> 01:18:19,325
If Albastı should arrive,
none of us will be here.

728
01:18:19,725 --> 01:18:20,725
It could get ugly.

729
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:24,005
Albastı won't come to the camp
if he has Ertuğrul Bey.

730
01:18:25,245 --> 01:18:27,445
There is no point in waiting here
like this.

731
01:18:28,925 --> 01:18:32,205
Henceforth,
I have to take on responsibility, too.

732
01:18:33,565 --> 01:18:36,085
Gündoğdu Bey is searching everywhere
with his alps.

733
01:18:36,765 --> 01:18:40,565
Under these circumstances,
it could be dangerous for you to go.

734
01:18:43,245 --> 01:18:45,765
Be that as it may, Abdurrahman Alp,

735
01:18:47,085 --> 01:18:48,965
there is no more time to waste.

736
01:18:49,405 --> 01:18:51,925
After all the things
Ertuğrul Bey has done for us...

737
01:18:52,205 --> 01:18:54,205
I am ready to give my life.

738
01:18:55,605 --> 01:18:56,805
All right, İlbilge Hatun.

739
01:19:00,605 --> 01:19:01,845
If that is what you think...

740
01:19:02,605 --> 01:19:04,005
let's head out at once.

741
01:19:29,845 --> 01:19:31,365
<i>May I enter, Sister?</i>

742
01:19:33,085 --> 01:19:34,085
Come in, Sırma.

743
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:39,605
Sister.

744
01:19:40,365 --> 01:19:42,485
The alps have gathered,
they're readying their horses.

745
01:19:43,205 --> 01:19:44,205
Where are they going?

746
01:19:44,725 --> 01:19:46,365
They are going to look for Ertuğrul Bey.

747
01:19:47,485 --> 01:19:48,725
I will go with them.

748
01:19:49,005 --> 01:19:50,005
Go, Sister.

749
01:19:50,245 --> 01:19:51,965
Don't come back until you find him.

750
01:19:52,725 --> 01:19:54,125
I'll keep an eye on the camp.

751
01:19:54,605 --> 01:19:55,845
Don't you worry.

752
01:19:57,605 --> 01:19:58,765
Take care.

753
01:20:03,485 --> 01:20:04,765
Take care, Sister.

754
01:20:05,565 --> 01:20:06,565
Take care.

755
01:20:13,325 --> 01:20:14,885
Be mindful on the road.

756
01:20:15,565 --> 01:20:18,245
They will be looking for Ertuğrul
everywhere.

757
01:20:20,085 --> 01:20:22,005
If I don't find him alive
when I get there...

758
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:24,965
then you won't be alive, Albastı.

759
01:20:26,685 --> 01:20:27,805
Don't worry.

760
01:20:28,765 --> 01:20:30,405
Not even a bird will see him.

761
01:20:31,965 --> 01:20:33,765
Go capture Gündoğdu and bring him there.

762
01:20:36,725 --> 01:20:37,725
Come on.

763
01:22:27,165 --> 01:22:28,165
Master.

764
01:22:29,525 --> 01:22:32,685
What are you doing here alone
with a sad face, Osman?

765
01:22:36,045 --> 01:22:37,165
I'm feeling down.

766
01:22:37,925 --> 01:22:40,765
I am dark inside
like the bottom of this well, Master.

767
01:22:42,725 --> 01:22:44,725
I try to drown my sorrow.

768
01:22:45,845 --> 01:22:48,485
Tell me, what is it that makes you sad?

769
01:22:51,245 --> 01:22:52,805
My father has been taken prisoner.

770
01:22:53,525 --> 01:22:54,925
He's in the hands of the enemy.

771
01:22:56,165 --> 01:22:57,365
There is no word of him.

772
01:22:59,525 --> 01:23:01,565
Your father may be captive,

773
01:23:02,685 --> 01:23:03,845
there might be no word,

774
01:23:04,805 --> 01:23:05,805
and...

775
01:23:06,485 --> 01:23:09,005
your father may never come back
to this camp again.

776
01:23:12,285 --> 01:23:13,605
You say that, Master, but...

777
01:23:14,085 --> 01:23:15,965
what will we do
if something happens to my father?

778
01:23:16,765 --> 01:23:19,085
What will we do without our bey?

779
01:23:21,405 --> 01:23:24,045
When your father embarked
on this holy path,

780
01:23:24,285 --> 01:23:25,885
did he trust his father, Osman?

781
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:29,805
Did your grandfather trust his father?

782
01:23:31,525 --> 01:23:33,565
He who walks the path of God...

783
01:23:34,485 --> 01:23:36,365
trusts only God himself.

784
01:23:37,405 --> 01:23:38,765
And no matter what...

785
01:23:39,325 --> 01:23:40,525
does not show frustration.

786
01:23:48,045 --> 01:23:50,565
Master, Turgut Bey is heavily wounded.

787
01:23:52,285 --> 01:23:54,045
Countless alps have been martyred.

788
01:23:54,765 --> 01:23:55,885
I don't know what to do.

789
01:23:57,765 --> 01:24:00,325
Then let me tell you what to do, Osman.

790
01:24:02,925 --> 01:24:04,165
It was the first days...

791
01:24:05,365 --> 01:24:06,885
of the announcement of Islam.

792
01:24:08,365 --> 01:24:10,765
Our prophet,
Sallallahu aleyhi ve sellem...

793
01:24:11,445 --> 01:24:14,685
had gathered his tribe
on the mountain of Ebu Kebeys.

794
01:24:15,365 --> 01:24:17,725
Everyone from his family,
all of his relatives, were there.

795
01:24:18,525 --> 01:24:22,405
And our prophet
asked that very important question:

796
01:24:23,965 --> 01:24:25,645
"Who will help me...

797
01:24:26,325 --> 01:24:28,165
on the path of God?

798
01:24:28,925 --> 01:24:32,005
Who will bear this heavy burden with me?

799
01:24:32,605 --> 01:24:35,365
Who will aid
the cause of spreading the word?"

800
01:24:37,485 --> 01:24:38,525
There was no answer.

801
01:24:40,205 --> 01:24:43,005
Uncles, aunts, nieces...

802
01:24:43,525 --> 01:24:45,565
kith and kin.

803
01:24:46,765 --> 01:24:47,765
They were all silent.

804
01:24:50,365 --> 01:24:53,125
Our prophet looked upon the faces
of the people that were present

805
01:24:53,365 --> 01:24:54,805
and repeated his question.

806
01:24:55,685 --> 01:24:58,485
"Who will aid me
on the path that leads to Allah?"

807
01:25:00,325 --> 01:25:01,325
Again, no answer.

808
01:25:03,645 --> 01:25:07,725
Our holy prophet's call
was about to be to no avail.

809
01:25:09,445 --> 01:25:14,605
Right then, a 13-year-old boy
carrying water in a qirba...

810
01:25:15,325 --> 01:25:16,685
not waiting to look around...

811
01:25:17,605 --> 01:25:19,165
not caring who was there...

812
01:25:19,885 --> 01:25:22,005
laid his qirba on the ground...

813
01:25:22,565 --> 01:25:25,245
and said
"I will do it, oh, prophet of God.

814
01:25:26,005 --> 01:25:27,765
I will help you."

815
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:32,165
Right then, Ebu Leheb said:

816
01:25:32,645 --> 01:25:36,925
"Oh, Muhammed... this boy will be enough
for you for the cause you speak of.

817
01:25:38,165 --> 01:25:42,325
Don't bother with us."
He made light of our prophet's words.

818
01:25:44,085 --> 01:25:45,965
However, there was something
he didn't know.

819
01:25:47,005 --> 01:25:49,645
That boy was to become...

820
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:53,165
one of our prophet's greatest companions
in spreading the word.

821
01:25:54,445 --> 01:25:57,445
That boy was to become
the lion of Allah...

822
01:25:58,685 --> 01:26:04,805
the wielder of Zulfiqar,
the unbreakable sword of the cause.

823
01:26:05,405 --> 01:26:06,765
He was to become Ali.

824
01:26:09,525 --> 01:26:10,765
Important causes...

825
01:26:11,405 --> 01:26:13,965
are furthered by committed, brave people
who believe in them.

826
01:26:14,805 --> 01:26:17,085
We just buried our martyrs.

827
01:26:18,165 --> 01:26:19,765
All of them were brave,
and they believed.

828
01:26:21,245 --> 01:26:22,445
God's cause...

829
01:26:23,725 --> 01:26:25,165
carries on because of those...

830
01:26:26,245 --> 01:26:30,205
who sacrifice themselves without
looking around when asked to help...

831
01:26:31,165 --> 01:26:32,485
and say "I,"

832
01:26:32,765 --> 01:26:36,245
and who give their life
in the face of cruelty.

833
01:26:39,045 --> 01:26:41,565
You know, when our bey
and our brave alps are with us...

834
01:26:43,165 --> 01:26:46,805
we say "We trust in God.
God will deliver us."

835
01:26:48,885 --> 01:26:49,925
God...

836
01:26:50,565 --> 01:26:53,845
looks down upon us
at times like these when...

837
01:26:54,565 --> 01:26:56,925
our bey isn't here
and our brave alps are wounded...

838
01:26:57,405 --> 01:26:58,245
to see if...

839
01:26:59,165 --> 01:27:00,125
our word is true.

840
01:27:01,885 --> 01:27:04,005
Do we do our best and trust in God...

841
01:27:04,965 --> 01:27:06,085
or do we trust people?

842
01:27:07,165 --> 01:27:08,165
Now...

843
01:27:08,805 --> 01:27:11,285
is the time to prove it.

844
01:27:13,245 --> 01:27:15,165
The cause of Allah...

845
01:27:16,365 --> 01:27:17,765
requires people like Ali...

846
01:27:18,605 --> 01:27:21,085
who will not look around
but will say, "I, oh prophet of God,"

847
01:27:21,525 --> 01:27:22,645
in our age, too.

848
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:28,045
Now is not the time to be sad or unravel.

849
01:27:29,205 --> 01:27:32,285
Now is the time to come forward and say...

850
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:36,165
"I will help, oh, prophet of God"...

851
01:27:36,645 --> 01:27:37,645
so that...

852
01:27:38,365 --> 01:27:41,845
God's cause may not be defeated
and the cruel may not defeat it.

853
01:28:28,965 --> 01:28:30,845
<i>May I enter, Sırma Hatun?</i>

854
01:28:33,485 --> 01:28:34,485
Come in.

855
01:28:41,045 --> 01:28:42,525
You sent for me, Sırma Hatun.

856
01:28:44,805 --> 01:28:45,965
What's wrong, Atay Bey?

857
01:28:46,805 --> 01:28:47,845
What are you talking about?

858
01:28:48,725 --> 01:28:50,085
We thought you were a lion.

859
01:28:50,605 --> 01:28:52,205
You turned out to be a nervous rabbit.

860
01:28:54,485 --> 01:28:56,645
Does this uneasiness suit
a bey of the Umur?

861
01:28:57,405 --> 01:28:59,685
Not nervousness but caution, Sırma Hatun.

862
01:29:02,285 --> 01:29:04,365
As you know, it is not safe.

863
01:29:06,285 --> 01:29:08,325
I know that it is not safe.

864
01:29:09,245 --> 01:29:12,285
However, at times like these,
not the war cries of foes...

865
01:29:13,045 --> 01:29:14,725
but the silence of friends is heard.

866
01:29:15,845 --> 01:29:17,645
If I'd kept silent,
my arm would be intact.

867
01:29:18,325 --> 01:29:20,405
Word of it being broken
must have reached you,

868
01:29:20,525 --> 01:29:21,885
since you sent for me.

869
01:29:22,365 --> 01:29:24,885
However, it is not my arm...

870
01:29:25,525 --> 01:29:28,405
but my heart that is broken
after the loss of our Beybolat Bey.

871
01:29:28,965 --> 01:29:29,965
Now, tell me.

872
01:29:30,605 --> 01:29:31,605
What is it you want?

873
01:29:33,005 --> 01:29:35,165
I cannot heal your arm
with a single word...

874
01:29:36,365 --> 01:29:38,005
but I can strengthen your heart.

875
01:29:40,445 --> 01:29:41,645
Speak, I'm listening.

876
01:29:42,205 --> 01:29:43,565
Then listen well.

877
01:29:49,725 --> 01:29:51,845
The bey of the Umur,
Beybolat Bey, is alive.

878
01:29:57,205 --> 01:29:59,205
He is with our Mongolian friends.

879
01:29:59,485 --> 01:30:01,885
They have captured Ertuğrul.

880
01:30:03,645 --> 01:30:05,445
Today is our day.

881
01:30:05,765 --> 01:30:07,765
Now is not the time to be cautious...

882
01:30:08,485 --> 01:30:10,685
but to step up like a brave man.

883
01:30:12,485 --> 01:30:15,525
Let's see who's loyal to Beybolat Bey
and who isn't.

884
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:19,765
Gather the beys who will support us.

885
01:30:20,725 --> 01:30:22,485
We're going to set up such a game...

886
01:30:23,725 --> 01:30:26,685
that they will see
we won't fit into the grave they dug.

887
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:43,565
Drink. The journey is long.

888
01:31:54,325 --> 01:31:55,805
Who told you to do that?

889
01:31:56,605 --> 01:31:57,925
No food, no water for him.

890
01:31:58,725 --> 01:32:00,085
Leave my sight. Go.

891
01:32:13,925 --> 01:32:15,405
Bring my provisions.

892
01:32:21,365 --> 01:32:24,085
I've waited for the day
you would fall into my grasp.

893
01:32:26,045 --> 01:32:30,725
Now, I will surely not deprive myself
the pleasure of tormenting you.

894
01:32:55,925 --> 01:32:59,605
You are like a sleazy dog
that brings the hunt to its master.

895
01:33:01,365 --> 01:33:04,485
Or like a rabid dog
that chases the bone that is thrown.

896
01:33:06,885 --> 01:33:08,805
If it wasn't for your master's shadow...

897
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,765
you would jump off a cliff again...

898
01:33:12,845 --> 01:33:14,765
you certainly wouldn't
stand before me like this.

899
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:18,925
Our terms were equal, Ertuğrul.

900
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:21,365
You also had your alps with you.

901
01:33:22,645 --> 01:33:23,685
But what happened?

902
01:33:24,965 --> 01:33:26,525
We slaughtered them before your eyes.

903
01:33:33,685 --> 01:33:36,325
You saw with your own eyes
how I drove my sword...

904
01:33:37,325 --> 01:33:38,925
into Turgut's chest.

905
01:33:45,805 --> 01:33:47,605
Look straight into my eyes, Albastı.

906
01:33:51,925 --> 01:33:54,325
See the vengeance
that will take your life.

907
01:33:57,565 --> 01:34:00,045
As my sword cuts through
your wretched body...

908
01:34:00,965 --> 01:34:03,285
these will be the last eyes you'll see.

909
01:34:12,965 --> 01:34:15,045
Your brother Turgut awaits you, Ertuğrul.

910
01:34:16,445 --> 01:34:18,285
You won't be able to avenge him.

911
01:34:20,605 --> 01:34:21,725
But, don't worry,

912
01:34:22,565 --> 01:34:24,365
you will be reunited very soon.

913
01:34:36,925 --> 01:34:38,645
We have a long way to go, Albastı.

914
01:34:41,325 --> 01:34:43,285
Don't go claiming victory just yet.

915
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:54,605
What will you do?

916
01:34:56,645 --> 01:34:58,805
Did you look into your dear brother's eyes
one last time?

917
01:35:00,845 --> 01:35:05,125
Did you see the fear of death...
the terror of Albastı in his eyes?

918
01:35:07,925 --> 01:35:08,925
Don't you worry.

919
01:35:09,645 --> 01:35:11,165
You will have a similar end.

920
01:35:18,885 --> 01:35:19,885
My eyes!

921
01:35:20,485 --> 01:35:22,565
Oh! My eyes!

922
01:35:23,165 --> 01:35:24,325
Bring water, quick. Come on.

923
01:35:28,165 --> 01:35:30,525
I will not give my life...

924
01:35:32,405 --> 01:35:33,765
without taking out those evil eyes.

925
01:35:37,405 --> 01:35:40,245
I will not let you die without vengeance.

926
01:36:03,485 --> 01:36:05,085
Your death will be worse, Ertuğrul.

927
01:36:08,405 --> 01:36:09,725
It will be such a death...

928
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:12,285
the devil itself will be scared.

929
01:36:26,005 --> 01:36:28,365
Where are you, my bey?

930
01:36:46,725 --> 01:36:49,005
We'll find you.
We'll find you, my bey.

931
01:36:53,805 --> 01:36:54,965
We'll find you.

932
01:36:55,405 --> 01:36:56,405
We'll find you.

933
01:36:57,285 --> 01:36:59,045
I won't leave my bey behind.

934
01:36:59,365 --> 01:37:01,405
I won't. I won't.

935
01:37:01,645 --> 01:37:03,845
I won't. I won't.

936
01:37:04,765 --> 01:37:06,765
I'll find my bey. Oh...

937
01:37:14,565 --> 01:37:15,565
Gündoğdu Bey.

938
01:37:16,045 --> 01:37:17,245
Gündoğdu Bey.

939
01:37:17,325 --> 01:37:18,405
Gündoğdu Bey.

940
01:37:19,605 --> 01:37:22,125
My bey.
There are tracks here.

941
01:37:26,525 --> 01:37:27,805
These tracks are fresh, Bamsı.

942
01:37:30,765 --> 01:37:32,085
This way, come on, alps.

943
01:37:32,885 --> 01:37:34,805
Come on. Let's go, alps!

944
01:38:12,285 --> 01:38:14,365
-Artuk Bey.
-Turgut.

945
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:15,845
Thank God.

946
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:22,965
At last, you woke up.

947
01:38:23,645 --> 01:38:26,045
What kind of a miracle is this, oh God?

948
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:29,645
There is no questioning God's will.

949
01:38:32,125 --> 01:38:33,125
My bey...

950
01:38:35,405 --> 01:38:36,765
How is my bey?

951
01:38:37,325 --> 01:38:40,005
Gündoğdu Bey and Bamsı
are looking for him everywhere.

952
01:38:40,365 --> 01:38:42,045
They'll find him sooner or later.

953
01:38:42,805 --> 01:38:44,285
Rest now.

954
01:38:47,325 --> 01:38:48,885
I couldn't protect him.

955
01:38:58,205 --> 01:39:00,965
I couldn't stop that traitor.

956
01:39:01,165 --> 01:39:03,965
Don't trouble yourself
with these thoughts now, Turgut.

957
01:39:04,445 --> 01:39:06,645
You need to get well as soon as possible.

958
01:39:09,285 --> 01:39:11,685
I cannot heal before...

959
01:39:13,525 --> 01:39:14,965
I see my bey alive and well...

960
01:39:19,325 --> 01:39:21,165
one last time...

961
01:39:33,925 --> 01:39:36,765
Hopefully you will, Turgut.

962
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:38,805
God willing.

963
01:40:55,245 --> 01:40:57,085
As long as I have life in me...

964
01:40:57,245 --> 01:40:58,605
I will not surrender to you.

965
01:40:58,685 --> 01:41:00,645
-Come on.
-Catch him, quickly.

966
01:41:29,285 --> 01:41:31,205
I knew you would try something.

967
01:41:31,925 --> 01:41:33,525
You had a chance to survive.

968
01:41:33,925 --> 01:41:35,525
Now you've lost that too, Ertuğrul.

969
01:41:35,725 --> 01:41:38,005
I'll tie you to my horse
and take you on foot.

970
01:41:38,565 --> 01:41:39,885
It's too early for you to die.

971
01:41:40,365 --> 01:41:42,605
You will die together with
your brother Gündoğdu.

972
01:41:44,725 --> 01:41:46,725
Wound him and take him down. Come on.

973
01:41:54,605 --> 01:41:55,605
İlbilge.

974
01:42:05,565 --> 01:42:07,525
It's too early for Ertuğrul Bey to die.

975
01:42:08,285 --> 01:42:10,725
But it's just the right time for you,
Albastı.

976
01:42:37,645 --> 01:42:40,365
I should've killed you
the first time I suspected you, İlbilge.

977
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:44,365
The snake has grown.

978
01:42:45,485 --> 01:42:46,885
It has poisoned us.

979
01:43:30,805 --> 01:43:31,885
Gündoğdu Bey.

980
01:43:32,165 --> 01:43:33,805
There is a cave up ahead.

981
01:43:34,325 --> 01:43:36,045
The tracks lead to it but...

982
01:43:36,485 --> 01:43:37,965
there's nobody around.

983
01:43:41,645 --> 01:43:42,885
Let's look in the cave.

984
01:43:43,725 --> 01:43:45,325
We will, Nephew, we will.

985
01:43:45,725 --> 01:43:47,445
However, we must be cautious.

986
01:43:47,725 --> 01:43:49,205
It might be a trap.

987
01:43:49,325 --> 01:43:50,365
All right.

988
01:43:50,525 --> 01:43:53,525
Günkut, tell the alps to surround the cave
from both sides.

989
01:43:56,165 --> 01:43:57,525
Come on, lead the way.

990
01:43:57,725 --> 01:43:58,765
All right, my bey.

991
01:44:19,725 --> 01:44:21,805
You have nowhere to run, Albastı.

992
01:44:27,645 --> 01:44:29,005
Neither a cliff to jump off of...

993
01:44:29,925 --> 01:44:31,445
nor a river to be carried away in...

994
01:44:32,045 --> 01:44:34,045
nor a master to come save you.

995
01:44:36,165 --> 01:44:38,005
You forget the power of my sword,
Ertuğrul.

996
01:44:42,325 --> 01:44:45,085
If one of us is going to die
on this ground...

997
01:44:46,165 --> 01:44:49,605
let our swords decide who that will be.

998
01:45:52,605 --> 01:45:54,365
Everything was for our lineage, İlbilge.

999
01:45:55,445 --> 01:45:57,005
I was the last male in our line.

1000
01:46:01,205 --> 01:46:02,845
Our beyhood will perish.

1001
01:46:05,485 --> 01:46:06,805
We have died out, İlbilge.

1002
01:46:07,845 --> 01:46:08,845
They destroyed us.

1003
01:46:09,925 --> 01:46:11,165
Beyhood is not about gender...

1004
01:46:11,645 --> 01:46:12,685
but about valor.

1005
01:46:13,845 --> 01:46:15,165
You don't have that.

1006
01:46:25,925 --> 01:46:26,925
Now, your blood...

1007
01:46:27,605 --> 01:46:29,805
will save our lineage's honor.

1008
01:46:35,845 --> 01:46:36,925
Your leash is broken.

1009
01:46:38,765 --> 01:46:40,445
Your masters' time will also come.

1010
01:46:42,165 --> 01:46:43,965
Until the likes of you are wiped out...

1011
01:46:45,045 --> 01:46:46,285
this war won't end.

1012
01:46:53,965 --> 01:46:56,205
Until the veins of treachery
are dried out...

1013
01:46:56,965 --> 01:46:58,925
my sword won't rest.

1014
01:47:00,805 --> 01:47:02,805
The wounds were for my nephew Süleyman...

1015
01:47:03,485 --> 01:47:05,845
and the people
you have oppressed until today.

1016
01:47:24,565 --> 01:47:25,605
This is for Turgut.

1017
01:47:30,685 --> 01:47:33,725
I told you the only thing you'd see
before you died would be my eyes.

1018
01:48:24,485 --> 01:48:26,405
Any word about Turgut, Abdurrahman?

1019
01:48:28,445 --> 01:48:29,445
My bey...

1020
01:48:29,805 --> 01:48:32,805
Dumrul, Mergen and all
the other alps there were martyred.

1021
01:48:35,845 --> 01:48:37,645
Turgut Bey was heavily wounded.

1022
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:39,285
He is at the camp.

1023
01:48:43,965 --> 01:48:45,645
You came just in time, İlbilge Hatun.

1024
01:48:47,245 --> 01:48:49,045
Now, take his body to the camp.

1025
01:48:51,885 --> 01:48:52,925
Tell the people...

1026
01:48:53,565 --> 01:48:55,525
that the traitor has been dealt with.

1027
01:48:57,125 --> 01:48:58,525
Give him a proper burial.

1028
01:48:59,645 --> 01:49:01,045
You are in charge now.

1029
01:49:03,965 --> 01:49:05,085
What will you do?

1030
01:49:05,645 --> 01:49:07,405
They lured my brother Gündoğdu
into a trap.

1031
01:49:08,045 --> 01:49:10,165
I have to get to him
before something bad happens.

1032
01:49:13,205 --> 01:49:14,805
Come on alps, to the horses.

1033
01:50:07,885 --> 01:50:08,885
Mother Hayme.

1034
01:50:09,605 --> 01:50:10,765
Tell me, my brave boy.

1035
01:50:11,485 --> 01:50:12,845
Tell your mother.

1036
01:50:30,045 --> 01:50:31,085
My bey...

1037
01:50:31,645 --> 01:50:33,965
Has my bey returned, Mother?

1038
01:50:34,565 --> 01:50:36,725
He will, God willing.

1039
01:50:38,005 --> 01:50:39,165
He will, son.

1040
01:50:51,485 --> 01:50:52,565
Hold on, my Turgut.

1041
01:50:53,445 --> 01:50:54,365
Hold on.

1042
01:50:55,245 --> 01:50:57,525
You've been through much worse,
my brave boy.

1043
01:50:58,925 --> 01:51:00,565
You'll get through this too, God willing.

1044
01:51:03,485 --> 01:51:05,565
We weathered storms.

1045
01:51:07,365 --> 01:51:09,085
We weathered hurricanes.

1046
01:51:11,725 --> 01:51:13,165
We became water.

1047
01:51:15,805 --> 01:51:16,925
You gave us water.

1048
01:51:17,085 --> 01:51:18,365
We flowered.

1049
01:51:20,765 --> 01:51:21,925
A day came...

1050
01:51:22,725 --> 01:51:23,845
when we faded.

1051
01:51:25,125 --> 01:51:26,365
We became ashes.

1052
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:29,165
You fanned the flames.

1053
01:51:31,285 --> 01:51:32,565
You became our stove.

1054
01:51:34,885 --> 01:51:36,245
We had no branches...

1055
01:51:37,645 --> 01:51:38,805
you became our knot.

1056
01:51:41,965 --> 01:51:43,525
Nobody loved us...

1057
01:51:45,045 --> 01:51:46,165
you became our companion.

1058
01:51:49,165 --> 01:51:50,525
I had no mother...

1059
01:51:52,485 --> 01:51:53,645
you became a mother to me.

1060
01:51:57,245 --> 01:51:59,805
I can never repay you, Mother.

1061
01:52:01,485 --> 01:52:02,485
I can't.

1062
01:52:11,245 --> 01:52:12,525
I'd die for you.

1063
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:15,925
There is no debt, my son.

1064
01:52:18,245 --> 01:52:19,245
I did...

1065
01:52:20,165 --> 01:52:23,565
what a mother should do for her sons.

1066
01:52:26,205 --> 01:52:28,565
It is I who can't repay you.

1067
01:52:36,165 --> 01:52:37,885
You knew no night...

1068
01:52:38,125 --> 01:52:39,685
no day...

1069
01:52:40,805 --> 01:52:43,245
no snow, no hurricane...

1070
01:52:44,165 --> 01:52:45,165
you fought...

1071
01:52:45,805 --> 01:52:47,885
put your life on the line...

1072
01:52:48,485 --> 01:52:50,365
for the honor of our tribe...

1073
01:52:51,205 --> 01:52:53,005
of our banner.

1074
01:52:55,125 --> 01:52:56,125
Now...

1075
01:52:57,445 --> 01:52:58,765
with God's permission...

1076
01:53:00,085 --> 01:53:01,525
get back up...

1077
01:53:02,485 --> 01:53:04,845
as soon as possible, to fight again.

1078
01:53:06,405 --> 01:53:07,445
My body...

1079
01:53:08,205 --> 01:53:10,245
might heal...

1080
01:53:12,925 --> 01:53:13,925
without seeing my bey...

1081
01:53:14,645 --> 01:53:15,805
alive and well.

1082
01:53:19,605 --> 01:53:20,605
However...

1083
01:53:23,485 --> 01:53:25,805
my heart won't, Mother.

1084
01:53:29,285 --> 01:53:30,845
This wound won't heal.

1085
01:53:34,205 --> 01:53:35,205
It won't.

1086
01:54:01,565 --> 01:54:03,405
If you wish to...

1087
01:54:04,885 --> 01:54:06,605
lighten this mother's heart...

1088
01:54:08,365 --> 01:54:11,485
get strong as soon as possible...

1089
01:54:11,805 --> 01:54:13,685
and stand up, son.

1090
01:54:51,565 --> 01:54:52,805
There's the cave, my bey.

1091
01:54:54,325 --> 01:54:56,045
Then they must have gone inside.

1092
01:54:56,965 --> 01:54:59,725
There are horse tracks everywhere
leading to the cave.

1093
01:55:00,125 --> 01:55:01,245
What if we're too late?

1094
01:55:01,805 --> 01:55:02,965
Hold on, Nephew.

1095
01:55:03,405 --> 01:55:04,405
Bamsı.

1096
01:55:04,485 --> 01:55:06,005
You wait here with Gündüz.

1097
01:55:06,405 --> 01:55:09,045
Günkut, take two alps and come with me.

1098
01:55:09,525 --> 01:55:10,565
Come on.

1099
01:55:16,485 --> 01:55:17,485
Come on.

1100
01:55:18,885 --> 01:55:21,645
Alps, you take precautions, come on.

1101
01:56:46,108 --> 01:56:47,308
What are these, my bey?

1102
01:56:48,508 --> 01:56:51,268
Preparations for
the sacrifice of souls ritual.

1103
01:57:13,908 --> 01:57:14,908
Arıkbuka.

1104
01:57:15,668 --> 01:57:17,908
You know my name well, Gündoğdu.

1105
01:57:19,148 --> 01:57:20,348
Where is Ertuğrul?

1106
01:57:22,588 --> 01:57:25,668
Rest assured,
he is in the safe hands of Albastı.

1107
01:57:26,868 --> 01:57:28,508
Now, it is your turn.

1108
01:57:29,748 --> 01:57:32,508
You and Ertuğrul have a lot to tell me.

1109
01:57:33,068 --> 01:57:34,108
I know.

1110
01:57:34,628 --> 01:57:36,068
I'll get what I want.

1111
01:57:37,228 --> 01:57:39,468
If I don't get your head first.

1112
01:57:52,028 --> 01:57:54,628
What saves the scorpion from the flame
is its own poison.

1113
01:57:54,988 --> 01:57:56,828
Even if its salvation is death.

1114
01:58:03,468 --> 01:58:05,428
This is poison.

1115
01:58:06,668 --> 01:58:07,708
Out.

1116
01:58:07,948 --> 01:58:09,028
Günküt, get out.

1117
01:58:15,428 --> 01:58:16,428
Out!

1118
01:58:42,348 --> 01:58:43,348
Alps.

1119
01:58:44,828 --> 01:58:47,748
-Alps.
-What is it? Günküt? Gündoğdu Bey?

1120
01:58:47,908 --> 01:58:49,268
What happened to Gündoğdu Bey?

1121
01:58:49,348 --> 01:58:52,228
Gündoğdu Bey.

1122
01:59:05,188 --> 01:59:07,588
Gündoğdu Bey, what happened?
Are you all right?

1123
01:59:07,748 --> 01:59:09,148
Trap.

1124
01:59:09,228 --> 01:59:10,348
It's a trap.

1125
01:59:15,788 --> 01:59:18,188
Alps, protect our bey.

1126
02:00:32,748 --> 02:00:34,188
Take Gündoğdu.

1127
02:00:35,988 --> 02:00:38,028
Kill the rest.

1128
02:00:45,468 --> 02:00:46,868
Holy juniper tree.

1129
02:00:47,348 --> 02:00:49,908
The sleep that comes before death.

1130
02:00:51,508 --> 02:00:54,188
Welcome.

1131
02:01:56,268 --> 02:01:57,268
Uncle?

1132
02:02:24,068 --> 02:02:25,388
-My bey.
-Father.

1133
02:02:31,548 --> 02:02:32,708
Ertuğrul.

1134
02:02:39,148 --> 02:02:40,668
My bey.

1135
02:02:41,548 --> 02:02:42,548
You!

1136
02:02:48,988 --> 02:02:50,868
Ertuğrul.

1137
02:03:07,548 --> 02:03:08,788
Come on, alps!

1138
02:03:09,308 --> 02:03:10,948
God is life!

1139
02:03:44,708 --> 02:03:46,228
If you don't beat me...

1140
02:03:46,988 --> 02:03:48,668
you won't win, Ertuğrul.

1141
02:04:29,548 --> 02:04:30,828
Father!

1142
02:04:33,028 --> 02:04:34,028
My brave.

1143
02:04:36,588 --> 02:04:38,668
You're all right, thank God.

1144
02:04:38,788 --> 02:04:39,788
My bey.

1145
02:04:41,388 --> 02:04:43,028
-My bey.
-Praise be.

1146
02:04:43,748 --> 02:04:45,028
Thank God, my bey.

1147
02:04:45,188 --> 02:04:46,268
Praise be.

1148
02:04:54,868 --> 02:04:55,868
Brother?

1149
02:04:55,948 --> 02:04:57,868
Brother. Thank God.

1150
02:04:58,108 --> 02:04:59,228
Thank God you came.

1151
02:04:59,868 --> 02:05:01,228
He dispensed poisonous smoke.

1152
02:05:01,548 --> 02:05:02,548
But we're okay.

1153
02:05:02,628 --> 02:05:03,788
We're okay.

1154
02:05:03,868 --> 02:05:04,868
Thank God, we're okay.

1155
02:05:04,948 --> 02:05:07,148
Still, we should make haste
to the tribe, Brother.

1156
02:05:07,508 --> 02:05:09,428
It might show its effect later on.

1157
02:05:10,988 --> 02:05:12,348
The bastard ran, my bey.

1158
02:05:16,028 --> 02:05:17,988
Thank God we didn't fall into his hands.

1159
02:05:19,388 --> 02:05:20,828
Follow his tracks, Abdurrahman.

1160
02:05:21,348 --> 02:05:22,988
-Be cautious.
-Yes, my bey.

1161
02:05:23,348 --> 02:05:24,348
Alps.

1162
02:05:29,988 --> 02:05:31,828
Ertuğrul, he knows our secret.

1163
02:05:32,508 --> 02:05:34,548
Don't let him get away, no matter what.

1164
02:05:34,828 --> 02:05:36,788
He could bring greater trouble upon us.

1165
02:05:37,508 --> 02:05:39,668
What he knows is less than
what he doesn't, Brother.

1166
02:05:40,788 --> 02:05:42,708
And he will do anything to find out.

1167
02:05:44,188 --> 02:05:47,468
And we will do whatever it takes
so that he only knows what we want.

1168
02:05:48,908 --> 02:05:50,868
Good.

1169
02:05:51,308 --> 02:05:52,308
Let's get to the tribe.

1170
02:05:52,948 --> 02:05:55,188
I need to see my brother Turgut, too.
Come on.

1171
02:06:12,468 --> 02:06:14,908
Atabey just told us about the matter.

1172
02:06:15,068 --> 02:06:17,468
We cannot express how happy we are.

1173
02:06:17,708 --> 02:06:19,108
What is it you ask of us?

1174
02:06:19,468 --> 02:06:20,708
Tell us, Sırma Hatun.

1175
02:06:26,188 --> 02:06:28,308
İlbilge Hatun is deluding herself.

1176
02:06:30,628 --> 02:06:33,868
The Umur are not a tribe
to tag along behind the Kayı.

1177
02:06:34,148 --> 02:06:35,188
By God, that's true.

1178
02:06:35,628 --> 02:06:37,068
We harbor the beyhood tradition.

1179
02:06:37,788 --> 02:06:41,388
If we were to be pulled along
with a rope to any path...

1180
02:06:42,308 --> 02:06:43,628
our symbol wouldn't be a ram...

1181
02:06:44,348 --> 02:06:45,348
but a sheep.

1182
02:06:46,628 --> 02:06:48,908
Then it is time to be
as stubborn as a ram.

1183
02:06:50,468 --> 02:06:51,668
Until my brother arrives...

1184
02:06:52,068 --> 02:06:54,788
we will not allow İlbilge Hatun
to rule this tribe.

1185
02:06:56,668 --> 02:06:59,628
Beybolat Bey will soon come
and sit on his fleece...

1186
02:07:00,068 --> 02:07:02,948
and pass judgement on those
who colluded with the Kayı.

1187
02:07:08,948 --> 02:07:09,948
Brother.

1188
02:07:42,828 --> 02:07:43,828
Brother.

1189
02:08:28,108 --> 02:08:30,068
Let this be a lesson to you all.

1190
02:08:32,788 --> 02:08:34,308
Anyone who goes against our law...

1191
02:08:35,068 --> 02:08:36,028
betrays us...

1192
02:08:37,788 --> 02:08:39,468
colludes with our enemies...

1193
02:08:40,628 --> 02:08:44,108
and goes after his own ambitions,
even if it is my very own brother.

1194
02:08:46,348 --> 02:08:47,748
He does not deserve to lead us...

1195
02:08:49,308 --> 02:08:52,068
but to lay under our feet.

1196
02:09:06,828 --> 02:09:08,228
By burying this traitor...

1197
02:09:08,708 --> 02:09:11,748
we will be burying our shame
in the eyes of

1198
02:09:12,028 --> 02:09:13,028
the other Turk tribes.

1199
02:09:17,508 --> 02:09:19,348
Now, everyone hear me

1200
02:09:19,468 --> 02:09:20,548
and hear me well.

1201
02:09:23,988 --> 02:09:24,988
Whoever

1202
02:09:25,268 --> 02:09:26,268
strives to...

1203
02:09:27,268 --> 02:09:28,348
sway from the law,

1204
02:09:28,908 --> 02:09:32,108
sway from the rules of the Umurs...

1205
02:09:33,748 --> 02:09:35,108
should know that

1206
02:09:35,748 --> 02:09:38,428
my dark sword will take their lives.

1207
02:09:49,868 --> 02:09:51,988
Now, take the deceased to the tent.

1208
02:09:52,468 --> 02:09:53,508
Come on!

1209
02:09:54,348 --> 02:09:56,828
Traitor.

1210
02:10:16,228 --> 02:10:17,228
Traitor.

1211
02:10:40,108 --> 02:10:41,108
Traitor.

1212
02:12:13,228 --> 02:12:15,308
Welcome my bey, welcome.

1213
02:12:15,388 --> 02:12:16,708
Welcome, my bey.

1214
02:12:21,508 --> 02:12:22,748
Welcome, my bey.

1215
02:12:36,308 --> 02:12:37,388
Ertuğrul Bey.

1216
02:12:38,668 --> 02:12:39,668
Father.

1217
02:12:39,948 --> 02:12:40,948
Father.

1218
02:12:44,468 --> 02:12:45,508
My Gündoğdu.

1219
02:12:48,668 --> 02:12:49,668
My God.

1220
02:12:50,188 --> 02:12:51,388
Thank you.

1221
02:12:52,028 --> 02:12:53,708
My sons have returned safe and sound.

1222
02:12:54,068 --> 02:12:55,548
Thank God.

1223
02:12:55,828 --> 02:12:56,828
My brave father.

1224
02:13:01,188 --> 02:13:02,788
My bey, welcome.

1225
02:13:07,468 --> 02:13:09,428
May God always keep you with us.

1226
02:13:25,348 --> 02:13:27,148
Just look at my braves!

1227
02:13:28,188 --> 02:13:29,268
Come here.

1228
02:13:29,708 --> 02:13:30,708
Just look.

1229
02:13:31,748 --> 02:13:33,868
You're most welcome.

1230
02:13:40,468 --> 02:13:41,588
Welcome.

1231
02:13:43,628 --> 02:13:44,708
Welcome.

1232
02:13:46,948 --> 02:13:47,948
My son.

1233
02:13:48,908 --> 02:13:49,908
Welcome.

1234
02:13:50,868 --> 02:13:52,028
Just look at you.

1235
02:13:52,508 --> 02:13:53,508
Welcome.

1236
02:13:54,468 --> 02:13:55,788
My Hafsa.

1237
02:13:56,268 --> 02:13:57,348
Come here, Hafsa.

1238
02:13:57,628 --> 02:13:58,628
Just look at you.

1239
02:14:04,468 --> 02:14:05,468
Selcan Hatun...

1240
02:14:10,788 --> 02:14:11,788
Welcome.

1241
02:14:13,908 --> 02:14:14,948
Welcome.

1242
02:14:15,028 --> 02:14:16,068
I avenged us.

1243
02:14:20,068 --> 02:14:21,988
What did those cruel men do to you?

1244
02:14:22,948 --> 02:14:24,668
They couldn't do anything, Mother.

1245
02:14:25,708 --> 02:14:27,348
It all collapsed on them.

1246
02:14:29,468 --> 02:14:30,708
I brought you good news.

1247
02:14:31,828 --> 02:14:33,628
Tell me, Son, what news?

1248
02:14:35,108 --> 02:14:36,748
Let me see Turgut first, Mother.

1249
02:14:37,548 --> 02:14:38,908
Then I will tell you everything.

1250
02:15:01,388 --> 02:15:02,428
My bey.

1251
02:15:07,148 --> 02:15:08,828
Will you just look at my brave?

1252
02:15:09,668 --> 02:15:11,348
Just look at my brave.

1253
02:15:17,508 --> 02:15:19,388
Just look at my brave.

1254
02:15:20,508 --> 02:15:22,908
I was so worried
that something had happened to you.

1255
02:15:24,908 --> 02:15:26,988
Now that I've seen you alive and well...

1256
02:15:28,028 --> 02:15:29,468
nothing can upset me, my bey.

1257
02:15:33,748 --> 02:15:34,908
We avenged you.

1258
02:15:36,588 --> 02:15:37,748
We got our revenge.

1259
02:15:38,788 --> 02:15:39,628
Did we, my bey?

1260
02:15:40,708 --> 02:15:41,788
We did, my brave.

1261
02:15:42,348 --> 02:15:43,348
We did.

1262
02:15:43,788 --> 02:15:44,828
Thank you.

1263
02:15:48,388 --> 02:15:49,828
-Turgut.
-Thank God.

1264
02:15:51,468 --> 02:15:53,588
Thank God, my brother, thank God.

1265
02:15:53,868 --> 02:15:56,188
Come. Come, let me help you.

1266
02:16:03,188 --> 02:16:04,788
Brave men...

1267
02:16:05,588 --> 02:16:06,868
and able women of the Kayı!

1268
02:16:07,828 --> 02:16:10,908
The blunt dagger
that has been stuck in us for so long...

1269
02:16:11,828 --> 02:16:13,108
has finally been broken.

1270
02:16:14,508 --> 02:16:17,268
The bastard Albastı
whom we knew as Beybolat...

1271
02:16:17,948 --> 02:16:19,508
has paid the price of his doings...

1272
02:16:20,108 --> 02:16:21,388
with his life.

1273
02:16:23,068 --> 02:16:26,908
Great!

1274
02:16:33,188 --> 02:16:35,588
The death of our martyrs
and the oppressed

1275
02:16:35,908 --> 02:16:37,188
has not been in vain.

1276
02:16:41,188 --> 02:16:42,228
From now on,

1277
02:16:42,908 --> 02:16:46,148
we will have only one response
to all our enemies.

1278
02:16:48,388 --> 02:16:49,308
A tooth for a tooth...

1279
02:16:49,708 --> 02:16:50,708
blood for blood.

1280
02:16:50,948 --> 02:16:54,948
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

1281
02:16:55,028 --> 02:16:57,348
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

1282
02:16:58,188 --> 02:16:59,468
Revenge!

1283
02:16:59,948 --> 02:17:02,988
Revenge!

1284
02:17:04,108 --> 02:17:04,948
Revenge!

1285
02:17:05,428 --> 02:17:06,708
Revenge!

1286
02:17:06,788 --> 02:17:09,228
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

1287
02:17:09,508 --> 02:17:11,708
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

1288
02:17:11,788 --> 02:17:14,468
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

1289
02:17:15,668 --> 02:17:16,988
Revenge!

1290
02:17:17,348 --> 02:17:22,668
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

1291
02:17:22,788 --> 02:17:27,428
-Revenge!
-Revenge!
