2
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:21,143
We won't take him captive now.

3
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:41,503
We're here, sir!

4
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:43,463
Kill him!

5
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:49,263
Allah is great!

6
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,823
This is not the end
of your troubles, Ertuğrul.

7
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:06,143
You will die on this journey.

8
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:42,943
Sir, Abdurrahman and our men
are still fighting. We followed you here.

9
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:46,303
We can't let that bastard run.

10
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:50,743
There might be another trap.
You go and help Abdurrahman, now!

11
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:53,143
-As you command, sir.
-As you command, sir.

12
00:04:53,423 --> 00:04:54,463
On your horses.

13
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:19,583
-We are being attacked!
-Where did they come from?

14
00:05:19,823 --> 00:05:22,263
You were followed, you clueless fool!

15
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:26,823
Come on, everyone! Allah is great!

16
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:28,863
Allah is great!

17
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:30,863
Come on!

18
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:45,143
We will take the gold quickly.

19
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:51,383
Get the chests in the cave as well.
We'll take them to the designated place.

20
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:54,223
Come on.

21
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:35,543
The fact that Taşkun Bey
is now the chieftain

22
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:39,503
does not oblige you to
accept his hand in marriage, Sırma.

23
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:43,103
You're struggling in vain, İlbilge Hatun.

24
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:47,543
Your sister made her decision
completely unbiased.

25
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,223
Keep your nose out of our conversation.

26
00:07:56,783 --> 00:07:59,463
I want to hear her say
she wants to marry you.

27
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:06,663
I can't turn down this prize
that fate itself offered me.

28
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:14,503
I'll accept Taşkun Bey's offer,
and carry on...

29
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,863
our traditions and cause, sister.

30
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:22,743
There, you heard it.

31
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:27,303
You no longer have command
of this tribe, or this tent.

32
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:34,783
You are not the chief of
Umuroğlu Tribe now...

33
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:37,463
merely a visitor.

34
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:49,183
This road that you littered with traps
will lead to your own death!

35
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:21,423
It's not Arıkbuka.

36
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:07,383
He played
one of the devil's tricks again, sir.

37
00:12:10,423 --> 00:12:13,343
-Where is Arıkbuka?
-What's the hurry?

38
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:17,263
Wherever you go, Arıkbuka
shall find you himself.

39
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:33,143
Should we track him, sir?

40
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:37,943
He must have erased his tracks.
Going after him is a waste of time.

41
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:39,823
We'll carry on our journey.

42
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:42,383
We should go back to
Abdurrahman and the others.

43
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:43,703
Understood, sir.

44
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:22,143
I set the game, I manage it,

45
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,303
and I'll finish it as I like, Ertuğrul.

46
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:08,103
What happened, Temüge?
Where are the others?

47
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:12,663
We watched the skirmish
from afar as you ordered.

48
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,423
They were all sent to heaven, Arıkbuka.

49
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:22,943
If they couldn't beat the enemy,
they're better off dead.

50
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:28,383
We still have work to do, Temüge.

51
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,863
Ertuğrul survived this ambush.

52
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:35,943
-But we will lay more traps.
-What will you do now?

53
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:39,383
Ertuğrul found out about the spy
close to Berke Han.

54
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:43,623
If that spy is exposed, we are done for.

55
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:50,263
That's why we'll set
the last and greatest trap.

56
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:53,063
Are we going to send this plan to him?

57
00:14:53,863 --> 00:14:57,863
Ertuğrul finds out about news
we send to Hülagü Khan.

58
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:00,143
That's why I won't send anyone.

59
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,583
I'll go personally.

60
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,183
I'll get there before Ertuğrul.

61
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:08,303
That way, our spy won't be exposed.

62
00:15:08,623 --> 00:15:12,223
And we'll prevent the deal
Ertuğrul wants to agree with Berke Han.

63
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,463
And I'll kill him before I'm back.

64
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:17,543
We should gather our men, then.

65
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:24,863
You shall stay here, Temüge.
I'll take some men with me.

66
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:27,463
What should I do here?

67
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:31,783
Our men captured the goods
Berke Han sent Ertuğrul.

68
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:34,263
You must protect them.

69
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:36,983
If something happens to them,

70
00:15:38,183 --> 00:15:41,183
kill yourself before I'm back, Temüge.

71
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:03,303
Keep in touch with Sırma,
sister of Albastı.

72
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:05,383
She'll be useful.

73
00:16:05,903 --> 00:16:07,103
As you wish, Arıkbuka.

74
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:57,103
Sir.

75
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:01,663
-Are there any wounded?
-No, sir.

76
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:03,263
We killed them all.

77
00:17:04,143 --> 00:17:04,983
Well done.

78
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,783
Arıkbuka knows that
we're going to meet Berke Han.

79
00:17:10,623 --> 00:17:12,583
He will surely set another trap.

80
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:16,703
He may even get in touch with his spies
over there.

81
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:21,103
Sir, could he set a trap
on the ship we're going to take?

82
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,703
Everything has been arranged
beforehand, Bamsı.

83
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:26,983
He can't even find out
where we are going to take the ship.

84
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,503
It's likely that our struggle
with Arıkbuka will continue on

85
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,783
across Berke Han's lands as well.

86
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:40,063
We must be prepared for any and
all kinds of treacherous traps.

87
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:42,823
Be alert at all times.

88
00:17:43,383 --> 00:17:46,663
A tiny mistake now will cost us dearly.

89
00:17:47,703 --> 00:17:49,943
-As you command, sir.
-As you command, sir.

90
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,463
Let's go.

91
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:02,383
Come on!

92
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:32,423
Calm down.
Take a breath and think, madam.

93
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:36,903
How can I calm down, Mengü?

94
00:18:37,623 --> 00:18:40,463
How could all those chiefs...

95
00:18:41,143 --> 00:18:45,023
choose Taşkun Bey over Battal Bey,
who I've been supporting?

96
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:53,143
All the chiefs pledged their loyalty
to you. It should be impossible.

97
00:18:54,023 --> 00:18:55,783
There must be a reason.

98
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:01,743
They must have been
enticed by something big.

99
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,343
Nonetheless, I won't let this one slip.

100
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,263
What are you suspecting?

101
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,343
I think there's a plot
behind it all, Mengü.

102
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:21,623
And I think Sırma has a hand in it.

103
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:24,143
Why do you think that?

104
00:19:25,783 --> 00:19:28,623
Sırma accepted Taşkun Bey's
offer of marriage.

105
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:31,143
And she shoved it in my face.

106
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:34,903
Taşkun Bey asked,
and Sırma Hatun accepted.

107
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:36,983
It's not that easy, Mengü.

108
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:41,543
It's obvious that Sırma knew
about this marriage beforehand.

109
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:44,223
She accepted the offer
since he became the chieftain.

110
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:48,703
So, she must have known he'd be elected.

111
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:53,743
How could they be so sure that
Taşkun Bey would be elected?

112
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:59,023
Now I see what you're getting at.

113
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:02,383
I'll solve it all.

114
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:07,343
I'll find out what Taşkun Bey and
Sırma have going on here.

115
00:20:09,183 --> 00:20:11,343
I'll follow them like a shadow.

116
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,023
You got what you wanted, Sırma Hatun.

117
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:26,863
Now all we need for you to be my wife...

118
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,583
is to have a wedding ceremony.

119
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:32,543
Of course, I'd like to become
the wife of a chieftain,

120
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:36,943
but I must make sure that the man
who will take me is a worthy man.

121
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:40,063
What does that mean?

122
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:44,663
You know what. I'm telling you
to prove yourself, Taşkun Bey.

123
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:48,223
Do you doubt me as a chieftain?

124
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:50,983
I'm not sure.

125
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:55,223
But if you want to prove your strength,

126
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:58,943
then you need to carry out your duty
like my father Umur Bey.

127
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:00,943
And how is that?

128
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:03,343
What duty would that be?

129
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,903
Collecting taxes.

130
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:09,943
You know that we came here
on the orders of our government.

131
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:12,503
That's only possible with a decree.

132
00:21:13,743 --> 00:21:14,783
Where is it?

133
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,703
That is a warrant to collect taxes

134
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:34,503
from the Umuroğlu Tribe
signed by the sultan himself.

135
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,183
Now...

136
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:41,343
it's time you proved
if you are worthy of me,

137
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:44,503
and how strong a chieftain you are.

138
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,623
You shall prove your strength
to the Kayi Tribe first.

139
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:00,783
One can hunt birds with wits.

140
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:05,343
However...

141
00:22:06,543 --> 00:22:08,463
one can hunt the lion only with strength.

142
00:23:18,423 --> 00:23:20,823
-What happened here?
-They were attacked.

143
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:34,463
Check the gold at once.

144
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:01,343
There is nothing inside.

145
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:08,183
Damn it! Incompetent idiots!

146
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:11,223
What should we do now?
What do we say to Arıkbuka?

147
00:24:11,623 --> 00:24:13,663
The only way is to find the gold.

148
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:16,943
Or Arıkbuka will shred us all to pieces.

149
00:24:17,743 --> 00:24:20,943
Everyone is dead.
There is no one left alive.

150
00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:26,223
Sırma Hatun.

151
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:29,223
Arıkbuka said she'd be of use to us.

152
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:32,743
Now is the time.

153
00:24:43,903 --> 00:24:46,303
Look what happened in
the Umuroğlu Tribe, Mother.

154
00:24:46,783 --> 00:24:50,423
Somebody other than İlbilge Hatun's
candidate was elected chieftain.

155
00:24:50,663 --> 00:24:53,063
There's a cunning game behind it all.

156
00:24:53,503 --> 00:24:56,183
It should come to light sooner or later.

157
00:25:08,903 --> 00:25:11,423
What happened, Mother?
What are you brooding over?

158
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:15,583
Things are going awry in the Umur Tribe.

159
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:18,383
I was just bothered by the news.

160
00:25:18,863 --> 00:25:20,583
Is it something serious?

161
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:23,223
İlbilge Hatun called a chiefdom vote.

162
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:28,223
But her candidate wasn't chosen.

163
00:25:29,383 --> 00:25:30,743
The tradition is clear.

164
00:25:31,623 --> 00:25:34,263
Whoever the chiefs see fit,
sits on that seat.

165
00:25:34,343 --> 00:25:35,263
True.

166
00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:37,623
But there is something strange
about it, Gündoğdu.

167
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:43,703
The elected Taşkun Bey wants
Sırma Hatun as his wife.

168
00:25:44,183 --> 00:25:45,063
How about that.

169
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:48,103
Shameless of her
to take up the offer, huh?

170
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:51,583
I have faith in our traditions, Son.

171
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:55,823
However, after all they have gone through,

172
00:25:56,143 --> 00:26:00,743
it's not good news that
they are still opposing İlbilge.

173
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,463
Did all the chiefs decide
to pull a trick on İlbilge Hatun?

174
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:12,183
They must be trying to take
advantage of Ertuğrul's absence.

175
00:26:12,943 --> 00:26:16,623
Let us head there with Turgut
and see the situation with our own eyes.

176
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:22,703
We can also visit the new chieftain,
and congratulate him.

177
00:26:23,263 --> 00:26:24,263
Excuse me.

178
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:37,703
Help this poor man, please!

179
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:42,223
Help this poor man.

180
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:50,903
Help this poor man.

181
00:26:52,223 --> 00:26:53,943
Help this poor man.

182
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:01,903
Help this poor man.

183
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,103
Help this poor man.

184
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:33,543
Why did you come here?

185
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:37,503
We need to talk, Sırma Hatun.

186
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:40,503
Talk now.

187
00:27:43,823 --> 00:27:45,583
We can't do it here. It's urgent.

188
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:51,343
In the name of Allah.

189
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:03,343
May Allah bless you.

190
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:05,303
Where do we meet?

191
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:09,503
Come to Albastı's grave.

192
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:11,983
I'll come, wait for me.

193
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,583
Thank you, lady.

194
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:15,743
Help this poor man.

195
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:21,663
<i>I wonder what you were talking about</i>
<i>in secret for so long?</i>

196
00:28:36,703 --> 00:28:39,663
<i>There must be something going on,</i>
<i>since she left the camp right afterwards.</i>

197
00:28:50,503 --> 00:28:52,983
<i>I'll find out what</i>
<i>you're playing at, Sırma.</i>

198
00:29:21,903 --> 00:29:22,863
Come on.

199
00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:03,263
Sir.

200
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:09,223
It's been so long since we last
saw the sea.

201
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:15,383
I've never traveled by the sea before.

202
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:21,663
When I think about those who
rule over the seas in ships...

203
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:24,783
I wonder if we'll ever
be like that, Father.

204
00:31:27,463 --> 00:31:30,623
The oath that was passed down
to us from Oghuz Ata...

205
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:34,703
says, "Conquer more seas and rivers."

206
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:37,463
Those days shall come, too.

207
00:31:46,463 --> 00:31:50,263
We'll raise our flag on the mast,
and set sail.

208
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:54,663
We'll ride the winds and
cut through those huge waves.

209
00:31:55,503 --> 00:31:57,263
We'll conquer overseas lands.

210
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:02,183
We will need sails and winds, of course.

211
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:04,863
But those are just tools, son.

212
00:32:06,143 --> 00:32:10,743
In truth, what allows us to travel
across land and sea alike is Allah.

213
00:32:12,983 --> 00:32:18,663
As long as we walk on Allah's path
and work hard for his cause,

214
00:32:18,823 --> 00:32:23,343
we shall pass through many
rivers and seas.

215
00:32:23,783 --> 00:32:24,863
I hope so.

216
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:26,823
I hope so, sir.

217
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:28,943
I hope so.

218
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:26,143
What happened, Temüge?

219
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:28,383
What happened at the tribe?

220
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:30,703
Everything is going according to plan.

221
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:34,583
With the help of the gold I got from you,
my man was chosen chieftain.

222
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,943
The rest shouldn't prove too difficult.

223
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:41,543
That's exactly what
I needed to hear, Sırma Hatun.

224
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:51,823
Look at that crooked beggar.

225
00:33:52,543 --> 00:33:55,863
Who knows what you speak
about over Beybolat's grave.

226
00:34:00,543 --> 00:34:02,223
Tell me why you called me here.

227
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:06,623
I need a lot of men
for a very important mission tomorrow.

228
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:10,783
And not just any men.
They must be loyal to Albastı.

229
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,303
What do you need them for?

230
00:34:13,663 --> 00:34:15,503
We'll deal a huge blow to the Kayis.

231
00:34:17,463 --> 00:34:18,343
Oh!

232
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,223
And you have a lot of gold
to gain from this.

233
00:34:23,303 --> 00:34:24,983
Leave it to me, Temüge.

234
00:34:25,423 --> 00:34:27,943
The trouble of my friend
is a trouble of mine.

235
00:34:28,863 --> 00:34:32,423
And if I can strike the Kayi
and earn gold for it,

236
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,343
there is nothing that can stop me.

237
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:43,703
You know the Mongols don't
like to stay in debt, Sırma Hatun.

238
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:48,423
Once we get this done,
we shall do whatever is necessary.

239
00:34:49,143 --> 00:34:50,703
Leave it to me, Temüge.

240
00:34:50,783 --> 00:34:54,223
You should also know that Umur
never let down their friends.

241
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:37,424
We've come here in the name
of Ertuğrul Bey, Taşkun Bey.

242
00:35:37,664 --> 00:35:39,664
We wanted to congratulate you,

243
00:35:40,064 --> 00:35:43,624
and also to consolidate relations
between the two tribes.

244
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:45,384
I was going to visit you.

245
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,064
May it benefit us all, Gündoğdu Bey.

246
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:51,064
Why were you planning to visit us?

247
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:54,904
Things cannot remain as they are.

248
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:59,224
I intend to establish a new order
in the Umuroğulları tribe.

249
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:02,464
I was coming to inform you
of my decisions.

250
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:15,664
As long as your new order does not
disturb the rules of the frontier beylik,

251
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:19,064
nothing will disturb us. But...

252
00:36:20,024 --> 00:36:22,144
it must be one based on justice.

253
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:25,224
You need have no concerns
about that, Turgut Bey.

254
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:29,104
We now just await the arrival
of our margrave, Ertuğrul Bey.

255
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:31,984
Why are you waiting for Ertuğrul Bey?

256
00:36:37,184 --> 00:36:42,064
A duty of taxation has been bestowed
upon the Umuroğulları by the state.

257
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:44,824
For years, the Umuroğulları
have collected no tax.

258
00:36:57,064 --> 00:37:02,184
There was a dispute between the two
tribes over this issue of taxation.

259
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:05,904
Pushing this matter
might not be a good idea.

260
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,584
I'm not in a hurry.

261
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,144
But I want to do it in time.

262
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:16,344
The taxation period is approaching.

263
00:37:17,264 --> 00:37:19,944
And the state expects its taxes.

264
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:24,224
This is not some worthless scrap
of paper that I hold.

265
00:37:25,064 --> 00:37:26,584
These are the state's orders.

266
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:33,464
We know better than you
what an order from the state entails.

267
00:37:34,944 --> 00:37:36,904
You should know us better, too.

268
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:44,744
If you make a decision without consulting
Ertuğrul Bey in his role as margrave,

269
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,984
then the disputes between
our two tribes will continue.

270
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:52,744
And this time,
it will be much worse, trust me.

271
00:37:54,384 --> 00:37:56,544
My orders are the orders I now hold.

272
00:37:57,184 --> 00:37:59,704
And I will discuss them
only with Ertuğrul Bey.

273
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:05,384
I will talk to him about this
when the time comes.

274
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:17,824
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you.

275
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:21,184
We will make landfall close to
Berke Khan's hunting ground.

276
00:39:22,144 --> 00:39:23,224
Very good.

277
00:39:23,784 --> 00:39:25,224
How long will the journey take?

278
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:28,544
We won't lower the sails. We will get
there tomorrow morning, God willing.

279
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:31,304
-Your horses will be waiting for you.
-Very good.

280
00:39:33,384 --> 00:39:36,944
Leave two alps with the horses.
Prepare for our departure.

281
00:39:37,784 --> 00:39:39,904
-As you command, my Bey.
-As you command, my Bey.

282
00:40:16,184 --> 00:40:18,424
What are you up to, Sırma?

283
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:29,024
Alps!

284
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:40,104
Where are you both going?
Is it something important?

285
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:42,144
No, İlbilge Hatun.

286
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:44,824
Then what's the rush?

287
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:47,224
We're just attending
to our usual duties, İlbilge Hatun.

288
00:40:47,784 --> 00:40:48,984
Nothing out of the ordinary.

289
00:40:51,024 --> 00:40:54,784
Sırma Hatun doesn't speak so passionately
when she's discussing everyday duties.

290
00:40:59,144 --> 00:41:02,784
We are to welcome a trading caravan
arriving tomorrow, İlbilge Hatun.

291
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:03,944
That's all.

292
00:41:07,344 --> 00:41:09,624
All right then. Good day.

293
00:41:18,424 --> 00:41:20,584
<i>A trading caravan, is it?</i>

294
00:41:22,624 --> 00:41:24,304
<i>Am I so gullible?</i>

295
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:28,624
<i>I know how to learn the truth behind it.</i>

296
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:51,544
We don't like Taşkun Bey's
attitude very much, İlbilge Hatun.

297
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,784
He showed us the state's taxation order.

298
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:59,984
He will start collecting taxes soon.

299
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,984
This is not about collecting taxes.

300
00:42:05,944 --> 00:42:10,264
He wants to show us his teeth.
He wants to make his presence felt.

301
00:42:11,424 --> 00:42:13,304
How did this man become
bey of the Umuroğulları

302
00:42:13,424 --> 00:42:15,344
instead of your candidate?

303
00:42:17,424 --> 00:42:20,464
Taşkun Bey's election
was organized in advance.

304
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:24,104
He's obviously planning to do
something over your heads.

305
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:27,984
We need to find out who has given him
such courage, that is the key.

306
00:42:29,584 --> 00:42:32,104
That is what I came here
to discuss with you.

307
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:38,384
Daughter, has something happened
in the village to raise your suspicions?

308
00:42:39,984 --> 00:42:41,704
I'm suspicious of Sırma, Mother.

309
00:42:43,704 --> 00:42:48,104
Taşkun Bey wouldn't have been
able to do all this on his own.

310
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:54,064
But I'm afraid Sırma is working
with someone we don't know.

311
00:42:56,064 --> 00:42:59,504
-Who could it be?
-Sırma met with a man in secret today.

312
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:03,304
Who? Did you recognize him, İlbilge Hatun?

313
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:06,984
No, I didn't.
He came disguised as a beggar.

314
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:11,264
Then he met Sırma again
at Beybolat Bey's grave.

315
00:43:11,584 --> 00:43:13,344
Then he must be a spy.

316
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:17,224
There is no other explanation.

317
00:43:17,984 --> 00:43:20,864
Had he ever been to your village
before, İlbilge Hatun?

318
00:43:20,984 --> 00:43:23,624
I've never seen him there before.

319
00:43:26,144 --> 00:43:28,904
That's why we need to find him fast.

320
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:34,584
It isn't only the Umuroğulları who are
in danger, everyone is threatened by this.

321
00:43:35,624 --> 00:43:37,504
I came to ask for your help.

322
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:41,984
Rest assured, dear.

323
00:43:43,544 --> 00:43:45,824
Your problems are our problems.

324
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:50,464
İlbilge Hatun.

325
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:55,824
You have always stood by our side
in the pursuit of truth and justice.

326
00:43:57,264 --> 00:44:00,704
We will do everything
in our power to help you.

327
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:01,904
Don't worry.

328
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,344
Thank you.

329
00:44:04,744 --> 00:44:08,224
Now, is there anything you can tell us
which may help us find this man?

330
00:44:09,424 --> 00:44:13,104
I saw Sırma giving instructions
to some alps after talking to him.

331
00:44:13,824 --> 00:44:18,344
Apparently, a caravan is coming tomorrow.
They are to welcome it.

332
00:44:19,944 --> 00:44:22,464
But no such caravan is due
to come to the village.

333
00:44:23,504 --> 00:44:27,024
Whatever she was discussing with
that man must be connected to it.

334
00:44:28,704 --> 00:44:33,224
We will take position near
the Umuroğulları village tomorrow.

335
00:44:34,824 --> 00:44:36,584
We will follow the alps when they leave.

336
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,624
Let's see who's behind all this.

337
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:46,424
-<i>May I come in?</i>
-Come in, Melikşah.

338
00:44:54,104 --> 00:44:56,944
Budak. What are you doing here?

339
00:44:57,064 --> 00:44:58,864
My Bey, I come from the village.

340
00:44:58,984 --> 00:45:01,344
Sungur Tekin Bey has an urgent letter
for you.

341
00:45:13,504 --> 00:45:15,064
Excuse me.

342
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:16,944
Of course, my dear.

343
00:45:20,144 --> 00:45:22,464
Gündoğdu? What's happened?

344
00:45:47,224 --> 00:45:48,864
I didn't see much of you today.

345
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:52,944
-Where were you?
-Our friends sent word.

346
00:45:53,344 --> 00:45:55,304
I went to ask what they wanted.

347
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:59,584
Well. Who are these friends?

348
00:46:02,264 --> 00:46:04,224
It's better you don't know
too much, Taşkun Bey.

349
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:08,104
Know that you owe your title to them,
that's enough.

350
00:46:12,384 --> 00:46:14,184
I'm aware of everything, Sırma Hatun.

351
00:46:15,864 --> 00:46:17,984
So tell me, what do they want?

352
00:46:18,744 --> 00:46:22,144
They want our alps
in return for their help.

353
00:46:23,424 --> 00:46:26,624
Moreover, they say
they will reward us for it.

354
00:46:27,504 --> 00:46:30,544
That means lots of gold for our coffers.

355
00:46:36,624 --> 00:46:39,704
Talk of gold from the mouth

356
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:41,864
of an intelligent woman.

357
00:46:43,504 --> 00:46:44,904
What else could I want?

358
00:46:46,224 --> 00:46:50,144
Stop fooling around and tell me what
happened with Turgut and Gündoğdu.

359
00:46:50,624 --> 00:46:52,944
I told them what Umur bey
should have told them.

360
00:46:53,424 --> 00:46:57,064
I said I was going to collect taxes
and that I'm waiting for Ertuğrul.

361
00:46:57,864 --> 00:46:59,304
What did they do?

362
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:01,904
First, they tried to intimidate me.

363
00:47:02,464 --> 00:47:07,064
Then, when they saw they weren't going to
be able to walk all over me, they left.

364
00:47:07,904 --> 00:47:10,904
Good. You behaved just as I hoped.

365
00:47:12,584 --> 00:47:16,144
They apparently mistook the insignia
hanging from our tent for a lamb.

366
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:19,344
They will realize their mistake
when the ram's horns hit them.

367
00:47:37,264 --> 00:47:41,064
My son, İltekin... fought the Mongols.

368
00:47:44,384 --> 00:47:45,984
Dündar went after him.

369
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:48,584
It was chaos, Mother.

370
00:47:52,944 --> 00:47:56,744
İltekin. The Mongols have already
taken one of my children, Mother.

371
00:47:56,864 --> 00:47:59,504
I could not bear to lose another child.

372
00:47:59,704 --> 00:48:02,624
-Calm down, dear.
-Calm down, wife, he hasn't been captured.

373
00:48:04,784 --> 00:48:08,304
But we've had no word from him.
Dündar has gone after him.

374
00:48:08,424 --> 00:48:11,424
He won't come back without him,
believe me. Don't worry.

375
00:48:14,104 --> 00:48:14,984
Dear.

376
00:48:15,064 --> 00:48:17,784
But it means we must set out at dawn.

377
00:48:22,224 --> 00:48:25,304
They're sure to attack the villages again.
We have to be ready.

378
00:48:28,464 --> 00:48:30,544
You're going away again so soon, Son?

379
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:33,064
Don't be sad, Mother.

380
00:48:34,944 --> 00:48:38,024
Even if I go, Dündar will
no doubt return soon.

381
00:48:38,184 --> 00:48:39,984
He misses you very much.

382
00:48:43,704 --> 00:48:46,024
What about the great war
against the Mongols?

383
00:48:48,544 --> 00:48:51,104
Won't you be with us for that,
Gündoğdu Bey?

384
00:48:51,744 --> 00:48:54,664
I will join the war with the tribes
in the east, Artuk Bey.

385
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:58,904
Dündar will be here while I'm gone.

386
00:48:59,464 --> 00:49:03,824
He's a tough and brave bey.
You won't notice my absence, trust me.

387
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:12,544
Turgut, we will leave at dawn.

388
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:15,664
You will stay with İlbilge Hatun.

389
00:49:16,144 --> 00:49:18,664
You and her will do
what we discussed together.

390
00:49:20,264 --> 00:49:22,024
All right, Gündoğdu Bey.

391
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:58,664
My mother.

392
00:50:02,024 --> 00:50:05,224
We were shaded by your tent
and warmed by your fire.

393
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:07,464
Give me your blessing.

394
00:50:10,104 --> 00:50:13,384
My dear, beautiful daughter.

395
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,304
You put up with all our problems,
all our trials.

396
00:50:18,304 --> 00:50:22,864
You weren't just a bride,
but a daughter and a friend.

397
00:50:23,744 --> 00:50:25,744
You must give me your blessing.

398
00:50:26,104 --> 00:50:27,224
Mother.

399
00:50:28,784 --> 00:50:30,584
You have it a thousand times.

400
00:50:36,544 --> 00:50:37,584
Uncle.

401
00:50:41,744 --> 00:50:45,144
I wish we could always live
in the same village and the same tent.

402
00:50:49,624 --> 00:50:52,144
Mother, give me your blessing.

403
00:50:57,704 --> 00:50:59,104
You have it, Son.

404
00:51:01,344 --> 00:51:04,304
My Süleyman Shah named you after the sun.

405
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,784
But you've never had
a chance to enjoy its warmth.

406
00:51:08,744 --> 00:51:12,984
God willing, you will defeat the enemy
and finally feel its warmth on your face,

407
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:16,664
and be happy in your village
and in your tent, my son.

408
00:51:17,224 --> 00:51:18,784
I hope so, Mother.

409
00:51:19,104 --> 00:51:21,064
God willing, Mother. God willing.

410
00:51:25,184 --> 00:51:26,224
Uncle.

411
00:51:30,544 --> 00:51:34,784
Give my greetings to my brother İltekin
and my uncles Dündar and Sungur Tekin.

412
00:51:35,144 --> 00:51:37,344
I will, Nephew. I will.

413
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:42,784
Come then, my brave ones. Let's go.

414
00:52:12,784 --> 00:52:15,104
Your horses are ready for you,
Ertuğrul Bey.

415
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:17,704
We've sent word to Berke Khan
to expect you.

416
00:52:17,904 --> 00:52:18,984
He's hunting.

417
00:52:19,384 --> 00:52:21,984
Very good. We can take it from here.

418
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:24,744
Safe journey.

419
00:52:30,784 --> 00:52:33,664
My Bey.
Once before, many years ago,

420
00:52:33,744 --> 00:52:36,144
we crossed the sea
to go after the Mongols.

421
00:52:38,064 --> 00:52:40,984
But Berke Khan isn't like those Mongols.

422
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:44,944
We know him to be an honest Muslim.

423
00:52:45,584 --> 00:52:49,784
That he fought his kin, Hülagü Khan,
for justice, means we can be sure of that.

424
00:52:51,024 --> 00:52:52,064
My Bey.

425
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:54,944
Berke Khan's messenger,
Torumtay, was killed.

426
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,144
Won't that be a problem for us?

427
00:52:57,504 --> 00:53:01,224
We came here to prevent
possible setbacks, Abdurrahman.

428
00:53:03,904 --> 00:53:05,944
Torumtay's death is important, however.

429
00:53:07,264 --> 00:53:11,944
Berke Khan is a mighty, just and honest
ruler, but he is also a demanding one.

430
00:53:12,984 --> 00:53:14,424
It will be no easy task

431
00:53:14,504 --> 00:53:18,544
to explain his envoy's death to him
and convince him of the culprit.

432
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:24,384
But every difficulty has its own solution.

433
00:53:24,824 --> 00:53:28,264
It is our duty to tell him the truth.

434
00:53:29,984 --> 00:53:32,864
Allah will ensure he trusts our word,
Abdurrahman.

435
00:53:35,704 --> 00:53:38,024
-Let's get to it.
-Very good, my Bey.

436
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:51,544
Come on, brothers.

437
00:55:21,104 --> 00:55:22,184
My Khan.

438
00:55:23,264 --> 00:55:25,424
Forgive my wondering, but...

439
00:55:25,544 --> 00:55:28,704
we've been hunting with
our army for almost a month.

440
00:55:29,384 --> 00:55:30,904
And while there are many animals

441
00:55:31,024 --> 00:55:33,224
you could have hunted
for their meat or fur,

442
00:55:33,544 --> 00:55:35,304
you have only hunted crows.

443
00:55:37,344 --> 00:55:38,264
Why is that?

444
00:55:48,864 --> 00:55:51,064
This crow is a mimic.

445
00:55:53,064 --> 00:55:55,584
It can mimic a wolf's howl, a lion's roar.

446
00:55:58,384 --> 00:56:02,304
It can even mimic a man's voice
to mislead a hunter.

447
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:07,304
When it sees a dangerous
hunter approaching,

448
00:56:07,744 --> 00:56:10,424
it immediately makes
the sound of a predator.

449
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:15,504
The other predators hear it and then kill
the hunter they've been lured towards.

450
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:19,984
This bird gets rid of its hunter...

451
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,784
and then eats his flesh.

452
00:56:24,184 --> 00:56:26,384
You must clear these birds
from the forest first,

453
00:56:26,504 --> 00:56:28,704
so you won't be hunted while you hunt.

454
00:56:42,104 --> 00:56:44,064
Where is the hunting army?

455
00:56:44,824 --> 00:56:46,744
We have encircled the three hills,
my Khan.

456
00:56:47,064 --> 00:56:48,784
We're closing in.

457
00:56:50,064 --> 00:56:55,424
But the game has managed to escape
from some of the army units.

458
00:56:56,344 --> 00:56:58,144
They've let the game escape?

459
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:02,304
Do these men think
that hunting is just a pastime?

460
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:06,624
Do they not understand that hunting
replicates the conditions of war?

461
00:57:11,944 --> 00:57:16,664
My Khan, visitors from Seljuk lands
have come here to meet with you.

462
00:57:16,944 --> 00:57:19,784
-Ambassadors?
-Ertuğrul Bey, bey of the Kayıs, my Khan.

463
00:57:23,624 --> 00:57:26,744
-Ertuğrul Bey?
-Why would he come in person, my Khan?

464
00:57:30,024 --> 00:57:33,704
It must be something very important
if Ertuğrul Bey himself has come.

465
00:57:36,304 --> 00:57:39,344
-Bring Ertuğrul Bey to my tent.
-As you command, my Khan.

466
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:43,264
I want you with me
when I talk to him, Kıyat.

467
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:47,144
Punish the men who let the game escape.

468
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:52,784
Those who couldn't contain the game today
will never hold the enemy tomorrow.

469
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,944
We're returning to the hunting tent!

470
00:58:16,464 --> 00:58:18,464
The Kayıs took your bey from you.

471
00:58:19,184 --> 00:58:22,384
And now they have stolen our gold,

472
00:58:22,984 --> 00:58:25,984
the gold that would have
made your tribe rich.

473
00:58:27,184 --> 00:58:28,704
Will we make the Kayıs pay?

474
00:58:29,024 --> 00:58:30,744
-Yes!
-Yes!

475
00:58:31,264 --> 00:58:34,464
Ertuğrul deserves to die.

476
00:58:34,904 --> 00:58:36,584
We will avenge our bey!

477
00:58:36,664 --> 00:58:38,024
We will avenge him!

478
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:39,544
We will avenge him!

479
00:58:42,704 --> 00:58:45,064
They might be what remains of the Mongols.

480
00:58:46,144 --> 00:58:49,944
But what is Sırma Hatun doing with them?

481
00:58:52,784 --> 00:58:54,824
What are you up to, Sırma?

482
00:58:56,664 --> 00:58:59,224
If you are following my brother's path...

483
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,064
I will never forgive you.

484
01:00:11,304 --> 01:00:13,144
I have been hunting birds with Berke Khan.

485
01:00:14,064 --> 01:00:18,904
I catch my prey earlier than he does,
and I always will, Kıyat.

486
01:00:34,304 --> 01:00:37,184
Berke Khan isn't after
the small birds he shoots, Arıkbuka.

487
01:00:37,904 --> 01:00:41,944
He uses them as bait
for much bigger prey.

488
01:00:43,544 --> 01:00:46,224
Ertuğrul came to see Berke Khan.

489
01:00:47,104 --> 01:00:48,744
And you followed him all the way back.

490
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:50,944
Tell me, Arıkbuka, what's going on?

491
01:00:52,064 --> 01:00:54,384
Ertuğrul knows about you.

492
01:00:58,224 --> 01:01:00,944
Don't be alarmed,
he doesn't know your name.

493
01:01:02,944 --> 01:01:05,064
He's bound to tell Berke Khan.

494
01:01:05,664 --> 01:01:08,504
It's your job to take
all necessary precautions.

495
01:01:09,064 --> 01:01:10,944
I'm just keeping you informed.

496
01:01:12,304 --> 01:01:15,264
Did you get your hands on
the supplies Berke Khan sent to Ertuğrul?

497
01:01:15,904 --> 01:01:18,424
-We have it all.
-And Torumtay?

498
01:01:19,824 --> 01:01:21,184
Dead.

499
01:01:24,864 --> 01:01:27,944
His envoy has been killed
and the supplies he sent stolen.

500
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:31,344
Berke Khan won't like this one bit.

501
01:01:33,664 --> 01:01:35,704
I know what to do.

502
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:39,224
Berke Khan has gone
to great lengths for this alliance.

503
01:01:39,704 --> 01:01:44,264
If he still trusts Ertuğrul despite
everything that's happened...

504
01:01:45,144 --> 01:01:47,344
there's only one option left.

505
01:01:47,824 --> 01:01:49,544
Ertuğrul and Berke Khan die.

506
01:01:52,424 --> 01:01:56,984
The reason I am here is to kill Ertuğrul.

507
01:01:57,744 --> 01:02:01,424
You take care of Berke Khan.

508
01:02:02,024 --> 01:02:05,024
I hope you make a better job
of killing Ertuğrul here

509
01:02:05,104 --> 01:02:07,624
than you did in Anatolia, Arıkbuka.

510
01:02:18,704 --> 01:02:22,144
Ertuğrul... He's tough.

511
01:02:26,304 --> 01:02:30,864
But my teeth are tougher. Don't worry.

512
01:02:42,064 --> 01:02:45,584
You have to learn how to cook
your game better, Arıkbuka.

513
01:02:46,544 --> 01:02:49,144
Otherwise, it might break those teeth.

514
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:27,144
Umur alps!

515
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:34,344
Drop your weapons and surrender.

516
01:03:35,784 --> 01:03:37,224
Why would we surrender to you?

517
01:03:40,464 --> 01:03:42,224
That man is a Mongol.

518
01:03:49,304 --> 01:03:52,504
You know what happens to those...

519
01:03:53,784 --> 01:03:55,504
who work with Mongols.

520
01:03:57,824 --> 01:03:59,984
Don't make the same mistake as your bey.

521
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:04,024
Don't die as traitors, surrender!

522
01:04:36,344 --> 01:04:39,184
Will you listen to the woman
who betrayed your tribe,

523
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,824
or will you avenge your bey?

524
01:04:41,904 --> 01:04:43,424
Revenge!

525
01:07:18,344 --> 01:07:21,264
-<i>May I come in, my Khan?</i>
-Enter, Kıyat.

526
01:07:31,824 --> 01:07:35,664
Where were you, Kıyat?
The hunt only happens once a year.

527
01:07:35,984 --> 01:07:39,024
-You should enjoy it.
-State affairs, my Khan.

528
01:07:40,024 --> 01:07:44,024
As men who have dedicated themselves
to the state, we can never be at ease.

529
01:07:44,464 --> 01:07:48,344
We may only rest when the state apparatus
is running smoothly.

530
01:07:49,464 --> 01:07:51,664
When my brother Batu Khan
founded this state,

531
01:07:52,024 --> 01:07:55,304
the top of his tent was decorated in gold.

532
01:07:55,824 --> 01:07:59,664
It symbolized the sun
shining over our state.

533
01:08:00,344 --> 01:08:04,264
For our state, you are a ray
of light from that sun, Kıyat.

534
01:08:04,864 --> 01:08:06,184
Thank you, my Khan.

535
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:12,704
I came here to inform you of news
we have just received from Anatolia.

536
01:08:14,104 --> 01:08:16,784
I'm listening. What is the news?

537
01:08:17,624 --> 01:08:21,184
The aid you sent to Ertuğrul Bey...

538
01:08:23,464 --> 01:08:26,184
has been seized by Hülagü Khan's men.

539
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:32,584
-How did this happen?
-I don't know.

540
01:08:34,184 --> 01:08:35,304
But...

541
01:08:35,944 --> 01:08:39,984
Ertuğrul Bey has obviously
messed up the arrangement.

542
01:08:41,264 --> 01:08:43,744
It's clear now why he's here.

543
01:08:44,904 --> 01:08:48,984
The supplies we sent have ended up
in the hands of our enemy.

544
01:08:51,584 --> 01:08:55,904
Who knows how Hülagü Khan must
have mocked us when he heard about it.

545
01:08:58,784 --> 01:09:01,824
These men have tarnished
our reputation, my Khan.

546
01:09:04,184 --> 01:09:06,384
There is still no word from Torumtay.

547
01:09:07,584 --> 01:09:10,384
God willing,
the same fate hasn't befallen him.

548
01:09:12,544 --> 01:09:15,984
There have been no such setbacks in
the exchanges we've had with them before.

549
01:09:17,264 --> 01:09:19,344
There's something odd about this.

550
01:09:20,264 --> 01:09:21,224
My Khan...

551
01:09:23,544 --> 01:09:25,184
after all this...

552
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:28,424
I am beginning to have doubts.

553
01:09:29,504 --> 01:09:32,584
-But I don't know how to say it.
-Tell me, Kıyat.

554
01:09:34,544 --> 01:09:39,144
You know that I trust you and that
there's nothing you can't tell me.

555
01:09:41,384 --> 01:09:43,824
The alliance, my Khan,

556
01:09:44,984 --> 01:09:47,304
with the Anatolian Turks should end.

557
01:09:48,424 --> 01:09:52,104
The only reason they sought
the union was to save their skin.

558
01:09:53,264 --> 01:09:56,704
These men couldn't even protect
the gold you sent them.

559
01:09:57,624 --> 01:10:00,584
What hope is there that they could
overcome Hülagü Khan's army?

560
01:10:03,384 --> 01:10:04,624
The aid is gone.

561
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:08,224
Torumtay's fate is unknown.

562
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:10,784
Because of their incompetence,

563
01:10:10,864 --> 01:10:14,224
the slightest pressure from Hülagü
Khan's men saw your plans collapse.

564
01:10:15,184 --> 01:10:16,544
I can only conclude that...

565
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:20,664
Ertuğrul Bey is not as strong
as we were led to believe.

566
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,424
My Khan...

567
01:10:27,384 --> 01:10:31,584
these men want to lead us
into an endless swamp.

568
01:10:32,864 --> 01:10:35,464
The ever-shining sun above our state...

569
01:10:36,704 --> 01:10:39,304
must not be dulled because of these men.

570
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:08,624
-Wait here, Bamsı.
-As you wish, my Bey.

571
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:15,984
Ertuğrul Bey is here, my Khan.

572
01:11:16,464 --> 01:11:18,064
Get my servants in here.

573
01:11:20,264 --> 01:11:21,824
Bring Ertuğrul Bey...

574
01:11:23,224 --> 01:11:25,304
-before me.
-As you command, my Khan.

575
01:12:09,744 --> 01:12:12,504
Berke Khan awaits you in his tent,
Ertuğrul Bey.

576
01:12:49,744 --> 01:12:54,584
I salute Berke Khan,
the just and the glorious.

577
01:13:00,824 --> 01:13:04,424
May the sun always shine above your state.

578
01:13:09,224 --> 01:13:13,464
To seal our alliance
against the oppressors,

579
01:13:14,464 --> 01:13:16,184
I have come here personally.

580
01:13:17,984 --> 01:13:21,904
What is the situation in Anatolia,
Ertuğrul Bey?

581
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,624
Anatolia awaits the spark
that will start the great war.

582
01:13:31,104 --> 01:13:36,384
Entire tribes stand with swords in hand
to fight Hülagü Khan's army.

583
01:13:38,624 --> 01:13:40,624
We have them surrounded.

584
01:13:41,344 --> 01:13:45,704
You tell me that Hülagü Khan
is besieged, but...

585
01:13:46,744 --> 01:13:49,024
the latest news I received
suggest otherwise.

586
01:13:53,544 --> 01:13:57,864
Hülagü Khan's men were able
to seize the supplies we sent you.

587
01:14:00,864 --> 01:14:03,824
Our alps went to collect those supplies.

588
01:14:07,064 --> 01:14:08,704
We received intelligence

589
01:14:08,824 --> 01:14:11,464
that Hülagü Khan's men were going
to ambush us there.

590
01:14:13,504 --> 01:14:15,904
But we took measures to thwart it.

591
01:14:16,584 --> 01:14:19,824
That runs contrary to what
we have been told, Ertuğrul Bey.

592
01:14:24,304 --> 01:14:26,624
The aid is now in the hands of the enemy.

593
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:33,864
Apparently, the fate of the aid
I sent you is a mystery.

594
01:14:39,304 --> 01:14:40,664
What about Torumtay?

595
01:14:43,224 --> 01:14:44,624
What's happened to him?

596
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,384
I met with Torumtay.

597
01:14:48,264 --> 01:14:52,504
But Hülagü Khan's men lured us
into a trap.

598
01:14:57,384 --> 01:14:58,904
Torumtay was killed.

599
01:15:08,664 --> 01:15:13,264
The aid is missing.
My envoy is dead.

600
01:15:15,264 --> 01:15:19,104
How dare you now come before me,
Ertuğrul Bey?

601
01:15:20,064 --> 01:15:25,104
I came here to discuss this with you
and to tell you what you need to know.

602
01:15:29,504 --> 01:15:33,624
It appears a dark cloud
surrounds these events.

603
01:15:35,584 --> 01:15:38,024
We must dispel that cloud.

604
01:15:38,824 --> 01:15:42,704
It was your duty to secure the gold
and ensure my envoy returned unharmed!

605
01:15:43,104 --> 01:15:46,344
You failed to do that! What else
do you think there is to discuss?

606
01:15:46,424 --> 01:15:48,144
What is this dark cloud?

607
01:15:51,704 --> 01:15:55,464
How am I supposed to trust you
and proceed with the alliance now?

608
01:15:59,464 --> 01:16:03,184
That is exactly what those
who are behind this want.

609
01:16:05,344 --> 01:16:07,024
To crush our alliance.

610
01:16:10,304 --> 01:16:13,424
The reason I came here in person

611
01:16:13,704 --> 01:16:15,944
was to discuss something
which involves you personally.

612
01:16:17,064 --> 01:16:18,184
So tell me.

613
01:16:24,424 --> 01:16:25,384
It's confidential.

614
01:16:30,664 --> 01:16:34,984
If we can speak privately,
I will tell you.

615
01:16:36,304 --> 01:16:40,584
As I said, it's you that it concerns.

616
01:16:44,944 --> 01:16:47,504
We have served our khan for years.

617
01:16:48,664 --> 01:16:50,224
We attend all meetings.

618
01:16:52,224 --> 01:16:55,144
What is so secret that it must be hidden
from us, Ertuğrul Bey?

619
01:17:00,824 --> 01:17:02,944
It is my duty to tell him privately.

620
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:09,584
If he sees fit to do so,
Berke Khan can then tell you.

621
01:17:12,824 --> 01:17:15,184
If it's just a matter of you
repeating your excuses,

622
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:18,104
there is no need to talk in private,
Ertuğrul Bey.

623
01:17:18,544 --> 01:17:19,944
We know what happened.

624
01:17:20,304 --> 01:17:24,264
We have gathered here to discuss
the war we have waited so long for.

625
01:17:24,584 --> 01:17:30,024
Tell us something about that
or stop wasting our time.

626
01:17:37,464 --> 01:17:40,624
You're Berke Khan's most trusted advisor.

627
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:46,504
Why would you want to prevent me saying
something which holds so much importance

628
01:17:46,584 --> 01:17:48,344
for your khan and your state?

629
01:17:49,224 --> 01:17:52,784
I don't want my khan's time
wasted with empty words.

630
01:17:53,184 --> 01:17:54,544
Enough!

631
01:17:59,584 --> 01:18:03,464
If I had done something which had
in any way sullied your reputation...

632
01:18:04,144 --> 01:18:06,384
I would never have left Anatolia.

633
01:18:11,704 --> 01:18:15,784
Send me away and end
our alliance now if you must.

634
01:18:17,264 --> 01:18:22,424
But we both still have a duty
to the Islamic world...

635
01:18:23,264 --> 01:18:25,664
to free the oppressed from tyranny.

636
01:18:30,224 --> 01:18:34,544
Without this alliance,
we will fail in our duty.

637
01:18:40,344 --> 01:18:41,704
The decision is yours.

638
01:18:50,704 --> 01:18:52,224
Everyone leave.

639
01:19:00,144 --> 01:19:03,264
I want to speak
to Ertuğrul Bey in private.

640
01:20:11,003 --> 01:20:12,443
Meet your end, you bastard.

641
01:20:20,803 --> 01:20:23,483
So, you came to our village
dressed as a beggar.

642
01:20:26,843 --> 01:20:28,763
We will find out what you're up to.

643
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:31,483
You won't get a word out of me.

644
01:20:35,323 --> 01:20:37,043
Start walking, then.

645
01:20:38,683 --> 01:20:40,443
We will take him to Umuroğlu Village.

646
01:20:40,643 --> 01:20:43,123
As you say, Turgut Bey.
Go on! Walk!

647
01:21:23,123 --> 01:21:24,683
I'm listening, Ertuğrul Bey.

648
01:21:25,443 --> 01:21:30,763
What do we know about the people involved?

649
01:21:31,683 --> 01:21:32,643
Betrayal.

650
01:21:34,683 --> 01:21:38,923
There's a traitor among you
who sends information to Hülagü Khan.

651
01:21:39,523 --> 01:21:40,963
Inside every state...

652
01:21:41,803 --> 01:21:44,523
there are maggots eating it
from the inside.

653
01:21:44,923 --> 01:21:46,363
You know this well.

654
01:21:47,043 --> 01:21:48,003
But...

655
01:21:48,963 --> 01:21:50,043
sooner or later...

656
01:21:50,763 --> 01:21:52,883
they're always exposed.

657
01:21:53,883 --> 01:21:57,763
But this instance concerns you personally.

658
01:21:58,603 --> 01:22:00,443
Tell me, why?

659
01:22:01,523 --> 01:22:04,643
The traitor is too close to you.

660
01:22:30,283 --> 01:22:31,403
Do you understand...

661
01:22:32,883 --> 01:22:34,603
what you are saying?

662
01:22:35,563 --> 01:22:42,443
Accusing somebody of treason
within my inner circle

663
01:22:42,843 --> 01:22:46,923
is treason in and of itself,
and there's no forgiving that!

664
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:51,483
The information Hülagü Khan has...

665
01:22:52,163 --> 01:22:57,443
is not ordinary, just the opposite,
quite valuable.

666
01:22:58,083 --> 01:23:01,963
It includes the secret correspondence
between us.

667
01:23:02,923 --> 01:23:03,963
That's how I know

668
01:23:04,523 --> 01:23:07,643
that this traitor is no common man.

669
01:23:08,123 --> 01:23:09,123
Who is it, then?

670
01:23:09,763 --> 01:23:10,843
Give me a name.

671
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,123
We will find out together.

672
01:23:14,843 --> 01:23:19,123
Now, I must know
who your closest confidant is.

673
01:23:20,443 --> 01:23:25,883
I talk about the state's affairs
with many men close to me.

674
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:27,123
The closest.

675
01:23:27,803 --> 01:23:30,483
The person closest to you.

676
01:23:31,443 --> 01:23:34,003
The one who knows
what nobody one else knows.

677
01:23:40,123 --> 01:23:41,203
Kıyat.

678
01:23:45,123 --> 01:23:47,603
Don't tell me you think it's him.

679
01:23:48,363 --> 01:23:51,403
He's the most valuable vizier
of this state.

680
01:23:53,363 --> 01:23:56,803
You're a wise and a strong khan.

681
01:23:57,683 --> 01:24:00,763
You know well that in affairs of state,

682
01:24:00,843 --> 01:24:03,083
even a son might stab his father
in the back.

683
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:05,563
History is full of such examples.

684
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,283
That is the truth.

685
01:24:07,723 --> 01:24:09,763
But what is your truth, Ertuğrul Bey?

686
01:24:11,643 --> 01:24:14,203
Kıyat has been at my side for years.

687
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:19,163
You come to me today from Anatolia
and accuse my best man of treason.

688
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:24,603
I need hard evidence,
not suspicious words.

689
01:24:25,203 --> 01:24:26,443
Do you have proof?

690
01:24:27,883 --> 01:24:29,323
I will show you proof...

691
01:24:30,803 --> 01:24:34,083
but for that, I will need your help.

692
01:24:35,883 --> 01:24:36,923
What kind of help?

693
01:24:37,963 --> 01:24:40,403
I will bait the traitor
into exposing himself.

694
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,403
All I want...

695
01:24:43,003 --> 01:24:45,283
is your permission to do this.

696
01:24:48,963 --> 01:24:52,283
I understand how hard
this must be for you.

697
01:24:56,723 --> 01:24:58,723
But we have no other choice...

698
01:24:59,363 --> 01:25:00,683
for justice...

699
01:25:01,243 --> 01:25:02,683
or for the state.

700
01:25:05,723 --> 01:25:06,883
We will test him.

701
01:25:08,043 --> 01:25:10,483
Then everything will become clear.

702
01:25:40,443 --> 01:25:41,483
I will test him.

703
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:46,203
But I have a condition.

704
01:25:48,603 --> 01:25:50,803
If Kıyat is not a traitor...

705
01:25:51,603 --> 01:25:53,643
then I will have your head.

706
01:25:56,403 --> 01:25:57,363
Deal.

707
01:25:58,483 --> 01:25:59,723
Now tell me...

708
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:02,563
how will we test him?

709
01:26:17,243 --> 01:26:19,003
The alps went to your friends.

710
01:26:19,603 --> 01:26:21,683
Let's hope they stay true to their word.

711
01:26:22,123 --> 01:26:23,963
Don't worry, Taşkun Bey.

712
01:26:24,283 --> 01:26:25,923
I don't deal with traitors.

713
01:26:26,483 --> 01:26:28,923
They're loyal to our friendship.

714
01:26:29,603 --> 01:26:32,883
And they will pay back our help
with interest.

715
01:26:34,643 --> 01:26:35,763
Let's hope so.

716
01:26:36,603 --> 01:26:37,723
Let's hope so.

717
01:26:38,643 --> 01:26:41,443
If they indeed pay us,
we can distribute the gold on our wedding.

718
01:26:51,283 --> 01:26:53,283
-What's happening?
-What's happening?

719
01:27:00,923 --> 01:27:02,123
Listen, the drums.

720
01:27:04,043 --> 01:27:07,323
Time to get the gold that
you've been waiting for.

721
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:46,843
Temüge.

722
01:27:52,203 --> 01:27:53,563
What is this, Sırma Hatun?

723
01:28:14,203 --> 01:28:15,283
Traitor.

724
01:28:16,603 --> 01:28:17,763
A traitor.

725
01:28:30,563 --> 01:28:31,603
What is this?

726
01:28:33,523 --> 01:28:34,683
Who is that man?

727
01:28:35,803 --> 01:28:37,283
Why are my alps tied up?

728
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:40,483
You enjoy acting as bey.

729
01:28:42,923 --> 01:28:46,523
But you don't even know your own people.

730
01:28:50,483 --> 01:28:51,523
These are traitors.

731
01:28:52,003 --> 01:28:54,483
Traitors!

732
01:28:54,843 --> 01:28:57,843
How can they do such a thing?

733
01:28:58,163 --> 01:28:59,443
Oh, Allah.

734
01:29:01,723 --> 01:29:02,883
What do you mean?

735
01:29:03,763 --> 01:29:05,043
What treason?

736
01:29:05,643 --> 01:29:07,643
Don't try to talk your way out of this.

737
01:29:10,483 --> 01:29:13,283
Everything will become clear now.

738
01:29:16,483 --> 01:29:18,483
Who do you think you are?

739
01:29:21,763 --> 01:29:24,563
You're talking to the Umuroğlu bey.
Don't forget that.

740
01:29:25,683 --> 01:29:28,283
We will see who is who in the tent, Sırma!

741
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,883
Umuroğlu beys to the tent!

742
01:29:39,843 --> 01:29:41,243
Take these three away.

743
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:45,483
It's time for the truth to come to light.

744
01:29:55,923 --> 01:29:58,043
Let's find out who holds your leash.

745
01:29:58,843 --> 01:29:59,843
Walk.

746
01:30:00,483 --> 01:30:01,363
Now!

747
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:30,843
I hope you didn't waste our khan's time
with nonsense, Ertuğrul Bey.

748
01:31:34,043 --> 01:31:36,483
If Berke Khan tells you what I said...

749
01:31:37,203 --> 01:31:39,283
you will know
whether it's nonsense or not.

750
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:52,203
Let's go, brothers.

751
01:32:24,803 --> 01:32:25,803
My khan.

752
01:32:30,803 --> 01:32:32,603
What did Ertuğrul Bey say to you?

753
01:32:34,683 --> 01:32:37,443
He kept repeating one thing.

754
01:32:40,323 --> 01:32:41,323
He said...

755
01:32:42,363 --> 01:32:44,323
that we have a traitor among us.

756
01:32:47,643 --> 01:32:49,843
Did he tell you who it is?

757
01:33:10,403 --> 01:33:11,923
No, he did not.

758
01:33:31,723 --> 01:33:34,243
But he will prove it
once he's back in Anatolia.

759
01:33:34,643 --> 01:33:36,003
He's going to show me evidence.

760
01:33:37,523 --> 01:33:42,683
Apparently, he's about to catch a Mongol
who knows who the traitor is.

761
01:33:45,763 --> 01:33:48,923
So the traitor will be exposed
once he's back in Anatolia.

762
01:33:53,683 --> 01:33:56,843
Then I will have a ship prepared
at the port right away...

763
01:33:57,563 --> 01:34:01,163
so they can return at once
and give us a name.

764
01:34:02,283 --> 01:34:03,723
They won't use the port.

765
01:34:06,123 --> 01:34:10,283
They couldn't keep our men safe
in their own lands,

766
01:34:10,763 --> 01:34:13,923
but we will demand every precaution.

767
01:34:14,883 --> 01:34:15,923
That's why...

768
01:34:16,763 --> 01:34:19,803
they will use a secret cove in the east.

769
01:34:20,683 --> 01:34:22,283
Prepare accordingly.

770
01:34:23,203 --> 01:34:24,443
As you wish, my khan.

771
01:34:35,123 --> 01:34:36,883
These mimicking crows...

772
01:34:39,163 --> 01:34:41,043
are like the traitors among us.

773
01:34:42,763 --> 01:34:43,843
They fool people.

774
01:34:45,323 --> 01:34:46,883
They mislead people.

775
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:49,963
The hunter becomes the hunted.

776
01:34:53,323 --> 01:34:54,363
That's why...

777
01:34:55,043 --> 01:34:57,403
we must take their heads.

778
01:35:15,523 --> 01:35:18,963
You gathered us all here.
Tell us what's happening.

779
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:22,043
This scum will tell you what's happening.

780
01:35:24,843 --> 01:35:27,523
Speak now. What is your plan?

781
01:35:39,363 --> 01:35:41,043
Did we tell you to smile?

782
01:35:44,563 --> 01:35:45,563
Talk.

783
01:35:47,043 --> 01:35:48,243
I don't know anything.

784
01:35:50,723 --> 01:35:51,803
I don't know anyone.

785
01:35:53,843 --> 01:35:56,203
Then why did you contact Sırma Hatun?

786
01:36:02,003 --> 01:36:04,083
Why did you come disguised
as a beggar?

787
01:36:11,203 --> 01:36:13,963
We only wanted to avenge Beybolat Bey.

788
01:36:18,883 --> 01:36:21,203
You're not even an Umuroğlu alp.

789
01:36:22,403 --> 01:36:23,563
What were you after?

790
01:36:24,083 --> 01:36:26,483
Why did you ask Sırma Hatun for alps?

791
01:36:29,323 --> 01:36:30,923
What did you offer her...

792
01:36:32,763 --> 01:36:34,643
in return for her help? Talk!

793
01:36:39,443 --> 01:36:40,683
Speak, Sırma.

794
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:44,363
What did he give you for the alps?

795
01:36:46,163 --> 01:36:47,443
What do you seek?

796
01:36:49,363 --> 01:36:52,083
You're doing this because your man
wasn't elected bey.

797
01:36:54,203 --> 01:36:56,403
Come to your senses.
I don't know this man.

798
01:36:58,723 --> 01:36:59,963
So, you don't.

799
01:37:01,763 --> 01:37:04,723
Then why did you meet him
at Beybolat Bey's grave?

800
01:37:10,203 --> 01:37:11,803
Why did you send him the alps?

801
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:16,323
He didn't give me anything.

802
01:37:26,283 --> 01:37:27,683
You wanted the alps...

803
01:37:28,243 --> 01:37:32,643
to take back Berke Khan's gold, right?

804
01:37:40,323 --> 01:37:41,923
What did you offer? Talk!

805
01:37:45,123 --> 01:37:47,043
Speak or I will snap your neck.

806
01:37:48,123 --> 01:37:50,723
We gave the gold to Sırma Hatun.

807
01:38:02,563 --> 01:38:04,643
Were you in contact with Taşkun Bey?

808
01:38:05,483 --> 01:38:06,803
Why would I know him?

809
01:38:08,643 --> 01:38:09,803
Kill him.

810
01:38:11,243 --> 01:38:13,843
Hold on, Taşkun Bey. Hold on.

811
01:38:28,483 --> 01:38:30,323
You wish to kill me...

812
01:38:31,043 --> 01:38:32,443
instead of saving me.

813
01:38:34,203 --> 01:38:35,323
If that's the case...

814
01:38:36,403 --> 01:38:37,923
let everyone know.

815
01:38:43,003 --> 01:38:44,923
We gave the gold to Sırma Hatun.

816
01:38:48,323 --> 01:38:50,243
We've given her gold before.

817
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:57,443
That man became bey thanks to our gold.

818
01:38:57,643 --> 01:38:59,443
Lies! Slander!

819
01:39:01,123 --> 01:39:03,643
This is a plot to take away my title.

820
01:39:53,563 --> 01:39:54,643
What happened, Kıyat?

821
01:39:54,883 --> 01:39:56,883
Did Ertuğrul talk to Berke Khan?

822
01:39:57,203 --> 01:39:58,123
He did.

823
01:39:58,723 --> 01:40:00,163
There was no deal.

824
01:40:01,963 --> 01:40:04,123
At last, we got what we wanted.

825
01:40:04,523 --> 01:40:07,603
No, a terrible thing happened, Arıkbuka.

826
01:40:07,723 --> 01:40:09,843
-What?
-Ertuğrul told Berke Khan

827
01:40:09,963 --> 01:40:12,043
that there was a traitor close to him.

828
01:40:12,523 --> 01:40:14,843
-Did he say your name?
-No.

829
01:40:15,323 --> 01:40:18,403
But he will reveal it as soon as he's back
in Anatolia.

830
01:40:18,763 --> 01:40:21,043
He will have all the evidence too.

831
01:40:22,043 --> 01:40:24,243
He's about to catch someone who knows me.

832
01:40:25,083 --> 01:40:28,763
If he didn't give your name, don't worry.

833
01:40:29,443 --> 01:40:31,243
You must kill him no matter what.

834
01:40:31,563 --> 01:40:33,203
I will send you soldiers too.

835
01:40:37,443 --> 01:40:41,163
I'm here to kill Ertuğrul anyway.

836
01:40:41,723 --> 01:40:44,083
I won't let him return to Anatolia.

837
01:40:44,763 --> 01:40:47,563
Nobody can save him here.

838
01:40:48,203 --> 01:40:50,563
I will set an ambush near the port.

839
01:40:50,763 --> 01:40:52,523
Ertuğrul won't use the port.

840
01:40:54,283 --> 01:40:58,083
He will use the cove in the east in secret
to be safe.

841
01:40:59,763 --> 01:41:02,643
You will kill him on the road
to the cove, Arıkbuka.

842
01:41:06,443 --> 01:41:09,083
Tell me which road, Kıyat.

843
01:41:19,603 --> 01:41:21,363
Everything is clear now.

844
01:41:23,323 --> 01:41:25,083
You sold yourself to them.

845
01:41:33,323 --> 01:41:36,603
Let's see what you bought with that gold.

846
01:41:42,523 --> 01:41:43,843
I will ask once,

847
01:41:44,643 --> 01:41:45,963
and you will answer me.

848
01:41:47,203 --> 01:41:48,523
Act like beys.

849
01:41:51,243 --> 01:41:54,803
Did Sırma Hatun and Taşkun Bey give you
gold or not?

850
01:42:07,723 --> 01:42:09,723
We got the gold as a gift.

851
01:42:10,483 --> 01:42:14,083
But we didn't know it was Mongol gold.

852
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:19,803
We regret it, forgive us.

853
01:42:35,763 --> 01:42:36,763
Scum.

854
01:42:39,643 --> 01:42:41,563
Your rule is over, Taşkun Bey.

855
01:42:43,443 --> 01:42:44,563
Your title is gone.

856
01:42:46,483 --> 01:42:48,283
You will pay for this.

857
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:50,683
End this nonsense now.

858
01:42:51,283 --> 01:42:52,523
I am the bey.

859
01:42:53,243 --> 01:42:54,563
Nobody can take my title.

860
01:43:32,603 --> 01:43:35,203
You tried to bite off
more than you could chew.

861
01:43:36,203 --> 01:43:39,283
Now drown in your own blood.

862
01:44:57,043 --> 01:44:59,283
Ertuğrul!

863
01:45:20,043 --> 01:45:23,643
No matter where you go,
you won't escape my wrath.

864
01:45:25,363 --> 01:45:28,403
Because we have
turned this world into hell!

865
01:45:29,483 --> 01:45:31,963
It's you who has fallen into hell.

866
01:45:33,763 --> 01:45:35,803
You will burn to ashes, Arıkbuka.

867
01:45:42,803 --> 01:45:46,283
<i>-Haldaga!</i>
-For Allah!

868
01:46:22,723 --> 01:46:24,323
I will decide now.

869
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:32,563
From now on, the new bey of the Umuroğlus
is Battal Bey.

870
01:46:40,283 --> 01:46:41,483
Come, Battal Bey.

871
01:46:57,403 --> 01:46:59,403
He who sells his vote for gold today...

872
01:47:00,283 --> 01:47:03,443
sells his honor, family and tribe
tomorrow.

873
01:47:08,763 --> 01:47:10,443
You are beys no more.

874
01:47:12,603 --> 01:47:15,563
The Umuroğlus will live on with honor.

875
01:47:23,123 --> 01:47:24,563
As for you, Sırma.

876
01:47:28,083 --> 01:47:29,683
You won't leave your tent.

877
01:47:32,243 --> 01:47:36,283
We will find out
who else you plotted with.

878
01:47:38,923 --> 01:47:42,683
I will find everything out and
punish you accordingly.

879
01:49:44,163 --> 01:49:46,523
Even your corpse won't make it
to Anatolia.

880
01:49:50,203 --> 01:49:53,483
You will never tell Berke Khan
the name of the spy.

881
01:49:53,963 --> 01:49:56,203
Ertuğrul Bey doesn't need to say it.

882
01:50:02,723 --> 01:50:06,563
Your ambush has already given
his name away.

883
01:51:07,923 --> 01:51:09,563
How could this happen?

884
01:51:15,483 --> 01:51:18,443
You will say that you will send us
from a secret cove.

885
01:51:19,003 --> 01:51:21,003
Only Kıyat will know about it.

886
01:51:23,523 --> 01:51:27,523
If we are attacked,
then the traitor is Kıyat.

887
01:51:30,043 --> 01:51:34,083
When we make the prisoners talk,
everything will become clear.

888
01:52:17,723 --> 01:52:19,243
Stupid Kıyat!

889
01:52:19,803 --> 01:52:23,283
That dog in Tabriz awaits news from you,
doesn't he?

890
01:52:27,403 --> 01:52:30,723
This world is too small for two rulers,
Berke Khan.

891
01:52:31,883 --> 01:52:35,843
Hülagü Khan will have your heads.

892
01:52:46,523 --> 01:52:47,963
When it's foggy...

893
01:52:48,763 --> 01:52:51,203
the jackals think they rule the world.

894
01:52:53,843 --> 01:52:55,523
But the fog is gone.

895
01:52:56,643 --> 01:52:58,963
We see that you're just a sheep.

896
01:53:01,323 --> 01:53:05,483
Your owner will receive your heads.
