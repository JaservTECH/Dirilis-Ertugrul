2
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,790
Are you all right?

3
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,870
Why did you come out like this?

4
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,950
I was going to come see you first, anyway.

5
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,350
I didn't want you to see me wounded

6
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,230
in bed like this, my bey.

7
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,070
You escaped the hands of the cruel
and came back...

8
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,990
I wanted you to see me on my feet.

9
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,070
Besides...

10
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,750
the only thing that kept me going,

11
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,750
despite this heavy wound,

12
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,430
was my will to see you one last time.

13
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,390
My brother.

14
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,150
We undid the torture and trap
of that bastard called Arıkbuka.

15
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,270
Thank God, my bey.

16
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,950
Thank God.

17
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,910
However,

18
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,870
this bastard called Arıkbuka

19
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,430
will cause us big trouble still.

20
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,390
Alıncak's blood brother.

21
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,470
He is hellbent on revenge.

22
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,870
He will do all the cruelty he can.

23
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,670
But we too won't be putting our swords
back into their sheaths.

24
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,310
With God's help, my bey.

25
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,750
With God's help.

26
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,110
We are always ready.

27
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,710
You just rest now.

28
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,430
You need to get strong and well so that...

29
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,750
we may take the heads of our enemies
shoulder to shoulder.

30
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,510
All right, my bey.

31
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,390
Very good, rest now.

32
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,910
What did you do, Abdurrahman?
Were you able to find him?

33
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,150
He threw us off his trail.

34
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,070
But the alps are still looking.

35
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,190
We know
that they won't leave tracks, Abdurrahman.

36
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,910
Still, keep on looking with more men.

37
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,390
Gather a division of alps.

38
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,790
And reinforce the patrols.

39
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,710
Put guards around the tribes
lying in wait.

40
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,190
As you wish, my bey.

41
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,990
My bey.

42
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,590
What is it, Artuk Bey?

43
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,190
Melikşah, you can go.

44
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,430
My bey,

45
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,510
the white-bearded
have sent this urgent message.

46
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,870
What does it say?

47
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,190
Very important matters, Artuk Bey.

48
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,590
They want me to make haste.

49
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,630
I will take some alps and go.

50
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,430
Stay by Turgut's side.

51
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,670
As you wish, my bey.

52
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,110
Artuk Bey.

53
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,950
If the enemy's sword spilled our red blood
onto the black earth...

54
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,910
it is time to ask for vengeance
from the black earth.

55
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,550
Let the souls of my comrades...

56
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,310
fly with fire.

57
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,230
When the black earth
drinks our red blood...

58
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,390
when the blue sky absorbs our souls...

59
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,550
when the souls mount mares
and head towards Heaven...

60
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,350
when my red Mother Fire
with 40 teeth is praised...

61
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,990
the fork horned moose
that I sucked milked from...

62
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,950
the Burkan Kaldun mountain
with its smoky helm...

63
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,950
Mother Rahan in Heaven...

64
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,870
Erlik Khan in black earth...

65
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,790
Tengri up in the blue sky,
ask only one thing of me.

66
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,390
Until the rivers run with blood...

67
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,030
revenge!

68
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,510
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

69
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,990
Until the dead of our enemies
pile up like mountains...

70
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,790
-revenge!
-Revenge!

71
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,430
Until we destroy them...

72
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,590
revenge!

73
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:20,110
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

74
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:25,350
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

75
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,750
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

76
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,630
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

77
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,670
Cowards.

78
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,110
They buried you here
like a beggar with no name...

79
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,190
like an outcast with no lineage, Brother.

80
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,750
A valiant man like you...

81
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,870
an alp like you...

82
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,190
they wouldn't even leave your sword
or your cap on your grave.

83
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,390
But don't worry...

84
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,910
I will take revenge...

85
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,550
from those

86
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,590
who did this to you.

87
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,270
You.

88
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,470
What are you doing here?

89
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,910
I brought what the betrayed

90
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,510
might desire.

91
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,550
Revenge.

92
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,670
Now is not the time for empty words.

93
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,590
Say what you have to say
or else take your shadow and leave.

94
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,550
Commander Alıncak's blood brother
Arıkbuka sent me.

95
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,590
He has a question.

96
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,190
What is it?

97
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,630
"Is Albastı's fair sister...

98
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,590
ready to avenge his brother?"

99
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,870
he asks.

100
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,750
Like never before.

101
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,430
Then wait for word from us.

102
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,710
Arıkbuka will come to see you.

103
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,270
Where?

104
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,950
<i>Selamunaleykum.</i>

105
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,550
<i>Aleykumselam</i>. Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.

106
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,630
Glad to be here.

107
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,710
Glad to be here.

108
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,910
From Anatolia to Khorasan,

109
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,550
from Transoxiana,

110
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,190
all the way to Cumania,

111
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,670
all high white-bearded
who have heard our call

112
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,110
have come to the holy feast

113
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,310
to discuss the latest situation

114
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,990
in the great war

115
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,310
we are going to wage.

116
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,710
We are in contact with
many powerful tribes in Cumania.

117
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,630
Alps are ready and waiting
for war with the Mongolians.

118
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,350
And we know who to talk to
in the Turk tribes in Anatolia

119
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,550
and the state.

120
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,750
We've specified steep winter quarters

121
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,990
for the tribes to fall back to
when the war begins.

122
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,470
It would seem that everything is ready.

123
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,910
Now, the crucial thing...

124
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,710
is for the alliance with Berke Khan
to come to a conclusion.

125
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,790
For after this alliance is finalized,

126
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,510
it will be time to

127
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,830
ride horses, draw swords...

128
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,310
and start the insurrection.

129
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,630
I met with Berke Khan's spy Torumtay.

130
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,750
Even though he fell victim to
Arıkbuka's trap,

131
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,590
he told me that Berke Khan
would send us help for the great war.

132
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,590
The first phase of that help

133
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,390
has arrived in Anatolia, Ertuğrul Bey.

134
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,030
It is on its way

135
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,590
through Byzantium land towards us.

136
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,550
We now need to

137
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,750
take delivery of them intact.

138
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,270
For the Turk tribes

139
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,470
who will enter the great war
in Anatolia,

140
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,270
we will be able to procure

141
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,910
horses, weapons,

142
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,350
and all kinds of provisions,
thanks to this help.

143
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,470
The delivery location of the gold

144
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,590
was written in a secret document
Torumtay had with him.

145
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,190
We have that document.

146
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,310
The Mongols might try to stop the gold.

147
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,790
I will take precautions

148
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,190
and make sure they arrive.

149
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,870
It wasn't good
that Arıkbuka saw you with Torumtay.

150
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,230
Arıkbuka will report this to Hülagü.

151
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,430
He will tell him that...

152
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,150
you are in contact with Berke Khan.

153
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,110
He will make you a direct target.

154
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,590
You entered in a hurry, what's wrong?

155
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,270
A secret message has arrived.

156
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,990
From whom?

157
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,470
Berke Khan's marquee.

158
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,830
Open it.

159
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,590
So, Berke Khan is
secretly sending gold to Anatolia.

160
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,830
Ertuğrul.

161
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,590
Only you could receive it.

162
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,430
Berke Khan's men are headed towards Söğüt.

163
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,830
They have crates full of gold.

164
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,070
They are going to meet in Tilkikoyan.

165
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,790
Quickly gather your men.

166
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,030
Ertuğrul will not get that gold.

167
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,350
Yes, sir.

168
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,350
And I will follow Ertuğrul.

169
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,790
If he goes to get the gold...

170
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,430
we'll finish him off together.

171
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,910
Quickly send me the messenger.

172
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,070
It's time to send a letter to Hülagü Khan.

173
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,670
That letter...

174
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,070
will be the sword
that falls on Ertuğrul's neck.

175
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,430
Ertuğrul.

176
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,590
Go on conspiring with Berke Khan.

177
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,070
We are his eyes that see,

178
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,110
his ears that hear,

179
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,550
even his tongue that he speaks with.

180
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,110
Hülagü Khan will send his army upon us,

181
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,350
not only for me, but to destroy
the warm bridges we have formed,

182
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,630
by causing great struggles
and to kill the hope

183
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,630
we nurtured with our blood and our lives.

184
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,110
We need to stop Arıkbuka
from sending information to Hülagü Khan.

185
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,790
And for that

186
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,750
we have useful information for you,
Ertuğrul Bey.

187
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,550
We just received this information.

188
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,110
We learned that a caravansary
on the road to Engörü

189
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,470
was the meeting point of Hülagü's spies.

190
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,870
We identified
that various information from spies

191
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,350
is gathered here

192
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,470
and then sent to Hülagü Khan.

193
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,750
The information about this devil's den

194
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,750
that we discovered is written in detail
on that note.

195
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,550
This is just the information we need.

196
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,230
I will quickly send my alps there.

197
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,390
The information Arıkbuka sends

198
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,910
will never leave this caravansary.

199
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,630
I will not allow it

200
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,190
to reach Hülagü Khan at all costs.

201
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,310
However...

202
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,070
Mongol spies are not only in Anatolia.

203
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,750
Do you suspect something, Ertuğrul Bey?

204
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,950
Hülagü Khan has to this day
been informed of all the contact

205
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,790
we have made with Berke Khan.

206
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,630
Recently, they found out
that Berke Khan's spy Torumtay came here.

207
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,510
All this points to one thing.

208
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,870
There must be

209
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,310
a Mongol spy close to Berke Khan.

210
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,870
We also have grave suspicions
about this matter.

211
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,070
Another very crucial duty
falls on you now, Ertuğrul Bey.

212
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,070
Berke Khan's spy Torumtay was killed.

213
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,670
And in our land.

214
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,070
This will no doubt upset Berke Khan.

215
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,470
From now on,

216
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,350
it won't do to discuss this matter
over spies or emissaries.

217
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,510
You were the one

218
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,030
who always made contact with Berke Khan.

219
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,950
That's why

220
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,390
it would be most suitable
for you to go to Berke Khan in person

221
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,630
both to reveal the Mongolian spy
close to him,

222
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,350
and to bring our alliance

223
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,550
to a favorable conclusion.

224
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,870
Many hardships

225
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,110
lie in your path

226
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,150
and await you at your destination,
Ertuğrul Bey.

227
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,830
The path and traps
of great and holy struggles

228
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,110
are formidable.

229
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,510
And formidable paths

230
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,950
require brave-hearted warriors.

231
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,190
The darker and hazier the path is,

232
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:56,230
the brighter will be the light of victory
that we will shine

233
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,670
after we overcome it.

234
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,790
Many oppressed souls wait for us
to shine the light of salvation.

235
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,630
Lighting that lantern

236
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,750
falls on us.

237
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,030
Taking on the most formidable duties
on that path

238
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,630
is an honor for us.

239
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:33,699
<i>It was none other than Ertuğrul</i>

240
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,419
<i>who snatched the secret chest,</i>
<i>took Keykavus away,</i>

241
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:39,939
<i>and killed Commander Alıncak.</i>

242
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:46,579
<i>He killed one of the most vital men</i>
<i>we had in Anatolia, Albastı.</i>

243
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:50,619
<i>And now, he plans to start a revolt</i>

244
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:55,379
<i>against us in Anatolia,</i>
<i>forming a pact with Berke Han in secret.</i>

245
00:22:55,979 --> 00:23:02,139
<i>If we don't cull the Kayi Tribe</i>
<i>and Ertuğrul, their chieftain,</i>

246
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:06,539
<i>they will start a huge uprising</i>
<i>in Anatolia.</i>

247
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:10,019
<i>For the aforementioned reasons,</i>

248
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:14,059
<i>we are solemnly waiting</i>
<i>for our khan to send an army.</i>

249
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:32,739
Take this letter to Tabriz at once.

250
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:38,819
You know who to give this to.

251
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,939
Come, Temüge.

252
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:57,339
Was that little doe burning of anger?

253
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:00,419
She was, and you should see it.

254
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,819
She is already consumed by the flames
of revenge. She only needs a nudge.

255
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:12,099
As my ancestors would say,

256
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:16,739
"Nobody destroys like a treacherous woman.

257
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:20,299
And nobody can restore
what she destroys."

258
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:25,579
Her heart must be blazing with revenge.

259
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,979
Let me have a talk with her...

260
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:34,259
so she can direct the fire
within her onto the Umuroğlu Tribe.

261
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,779
And the fire there should jump...

262
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:45,699
to its neighbor, the Kayi Tribe.

263
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:56,659
On this are written all the details
about the Mongolian spies,

264
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:59,419
as well as the caravansary
where they gather.

265
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:03,219
I understand, Bey.
Should we take our men with us?

266
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:05,299
You can't go with them.

267
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:09,179
You, Gündüz, and Günküt
will have to suffice.

268
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:12,499
Disguise yourselves.

269
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:14,819
-Be alert.
-Yes, Bey.

270
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,939
So, the letter says the Mongol army
might even invade Söğüt, huh?

271
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:24,419
That's why we must obtain whatever
information comes to the caravansary.

272
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:29,499
Turn the whole place upside down
if need be.

273
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:32,339
And don't return without that intel.

274
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:34,219
As you wish, Bey.

275
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:39,419
I will depart tomorrow to meet Berke Han.

276
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,339
Melikşah. Head to the Umuroğlu tribe
in advance.

277
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:45,419
Tell İlbilge Hatun to wait for me
at the camp.

278
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:47,539
I have important matters
to discuss with her.

279
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:49,619
As you command, Bey.

280
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:50,899
Bey.

281
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,459
What should we do afterwards?

282
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:56,899
Listen to me carefully.

283
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:20,539
Hello, everyone.

284
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:23,299
Hello, İlbilge Hatun.

285
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:27,979
The merchants we deal with
are awaiting the wool.

286
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:30,339
We must be faster and more agile.

287
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:32,299
Yes, İlbilge Hatun.

288
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:34,619
Go on.

289
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:53,099
Where have you been, Sırma?

290
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:56,139
Everyone started working
right after the burial.

291
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:58,659
I waited for everyone to leave, Sister.

292
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:00,819
It was our funeral, after all.

293
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:10,299
I took a detour because
I was afraid of the Mongols.

294
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:12,619
I started to fear everything.

295
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:15,899
Mongols even attempted to kill
Ertuğrul Bey. Imagine us.

296
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:17,419
Left alone, I got scared.

297
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:30,219
Is that Melikşah?

298
00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:41,019
-Hello, İlbilge Hatun.
-Welcome, Melikşah, what happened?

299
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:42,899
Good news, İlbilge Hatun.

300
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,979
Ertuğrul Bey invited you to the hall.

301
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,139
He has important things to discuss
with you.

302
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,219
As the margrave commands.

303
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:55,099
I will be there in the evening. Thank you.

304
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:57,099
All right, İlbilge Hatun.

305
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:12,779
Since he's calling you personally,
it must be important.

306
00:28:12,979 --> 00:28:15,819
The margrave probably wishes
to talk about the marriage.

307
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:19,419
-We must start the preparations at once.
-Not yet, Sırma.

308
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:22,859
Even if that's what it is about,

309
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:25,699
we still have to take care
of the business here before any wedding.

310
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:31,419
I must hand down my responsibility
in a manner befitting my position.

311
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:33,859
What do you mean, Sister?

312
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:39,019
Who will be the chieftain here
when I join the Kayi Tribe?

313
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:41,459
I must resolve that first.

314
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:45,659
I will accept Ertuğrul Bey's invitation.

315
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,219
And do what is necessary afterwards.

316
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:09,219
Thank God we came through
all that trouble, Bey.

317
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:11,419
Thank God indeed.

318
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:20,899
Why did you bother, mother?
I could have poured it.

319
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:26,779
Pouring sherbet for my son who
just returned from war is hardly a bother.

320
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:40,859
Here, Son.

321
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:42,699
Thank you, Mother.

322
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:49,019
Thank God.

323
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:52,179
Thank you.

324
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:57,819
My sons united as one
and defeated the cruel souls.

325
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:00,579
Son.

326
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:04,059
Your sword was able to cut down the cruel.

327
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:06,979
Our home is now in harmony.

328
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:12,499
Our tribe, our tents were happy,
but we are happier with you.

329
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:13,979
Thank God.

330
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:16,059
Thank God.

331
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:21,259
<i>-Selamunaleykum.</i>
<i>-Aleykumselamun.</i>

332
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:23,139
-Welcome, Bey.
-Thank you.

333
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:25,939
-Welcome, Son.
-Thank you, Mother.

334
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:32,899
Now I can see two of my sons defeating
the cruel together, praise be!

335
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,939
What more could a mother wish for?

336
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:46,419
Come, Son, let me pour your sherbet.

337
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:48,419
-Thank you.
-Let me do it, mother.

338
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:56,419
Thank you, Selcan.

339
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,099
We swore to be worthy of you

340
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:13,899
and the blood our ancestors shed for us,
Mother.

341
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:20,259
For as long as Allah places obstacles
in our path,

342
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:23,219
we will take down many more cruel men.

343
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:28,699
We will go through
many more hellish flames,

344
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:30,579
to hopefully come to rest by your side,

345
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,659
and drink this cold sherbet.

346
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:34,779
I hope so, Son.

347
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:37,979
Selcan, dear.

348
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:43,779
Have the women prepare
the cauldrons and bring flour.

349
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:47,619
Let us prepare halvah
to celebrate our victory.

350
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:49,139
Very well, mother.

351
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:50,699
Excuse us.

352
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,539
-See you later.
-Right, Mother.

353
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,779
The gold Berke Han sent us
went across the Byzantine border.

354
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:07,539
That's quite all right.

355
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:12,299
If they had gone through Anatolia,
the Mongols could have ambushed them.

356
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:16,059
-That's still a possibility.
-How?

357
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:20,579
There's a Mongolian spy
close to Berke Han.

358
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:25,899
The spy must have warned the Mongols
that the gold would come.

359
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:29,739
The Mongols could set a trap
to prevent the gold from reaching us.

360
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,859
The document we found
in Torumtay's clothes

361
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:35,499
states that the delivery location
is the Fox Valley.

362
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:39,259
-Be careful.
-Yes, Brother, don't you worry.

363
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,339
That valley is vulnerable to ambushes.

364
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,619
We use this seal to communicate
with Berke Han.

365
00:32:57,139 --> 00:33:00,739
When the men bringing the gold
see this seal, they will know.

366
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:05,379
Brother, the gold is of utmost importance.

367
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,899
We will send it all to the Turkmen tribes
in Anatolia.

368
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,059
We need it to buy
the necessary horses and weapons.

369
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:19,779
If something happens to that gold,
Turkmen tribes will be in danger.

370
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,699
And we will lose Berke Han's trust.

371
00:33:23,499 --> 00:33:27,219
I'm aware of all this, Brother.
Don't worry about it.

372
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:30,499
I know it just looks like
some gold from the outside,

373
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:34,059
but I understand that it's vital
for the ultimate battle.

374
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:39,179
And with Allah's help,
I won't let that gold be destroyed.

375
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,299
Thank you.

376
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:44,979
I will depart to meet Berke Han tomorrow.

377
00:33:46,939 --> 00:33:49,699
It's the last and hardest path
ahead of us,

378
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:51,899
before we can will light the fire for war.

379
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,459
We carry the prayers of a whole nation,

380
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:59,299
and face treacherous traps, cliffs,
and endless seas.

381
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,699
However, we made an oath.

382
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:08,939
To give hope by destroying the traps,

383
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:11,899
by climbing the mountains
and by crossing the seas.

384
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:16,819
We will light up Anatolia
with the fire in our hands.

385
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:54,819
Enough, Savcı.

386
00:34:56,019 --> 00:34:57,099
Thank you.

387
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:01,899
-This soup was delicious.
-Thank you, uncle.

388
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:03,459
May it give you health.

389
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:05,859
Amen.

390
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:14,819
If you weren't here,

391
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:19,059
I have no idea who would cook for me.

392
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,739
-I appreciate it.
-Don't mention it, uncle.

393
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:25,459
Every child in the tribe
thinks of you as their uncle.

394
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:27,699
Thank you.

395
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:29,779
<i>May I enter, Turgut Bey?</i>

396
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:33,499
Come in, master.

397
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:40,539
Don't trouble yourself, Turgut Bey.

398
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:42,939
Rest.

399
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:48,979
I just wanted to see you
and see how you were doing.

400
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:54,059
I'm fine, master. Thank you.

401
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:02,939
They said you didn't leave my side.

402
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:06,299
Just like how it was in my dream...

403
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:11,539
you really were beside me.
I really appreciate it.

404
00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:18,139
-I hope your dream is a good omen.
-Amen.

405
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:19,659
Amen.

406
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:22,699
I hope it is, too.

407
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:27,779
I was in heaven or something.

408
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,539
There were clear springs,

409
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,499
and flowers everywhere.

410
00:36:37,219 --> 00:36:38,299
And then,

411
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:40,139
I saw you.

412
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:43,819
You were planting roses.

413
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:49,059
When I asked what it was for,

414
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:53,019
you said it was for our martyrs.

415
00:36:55,659 --> 00:36:57,459
And then you told me about martyrdom.

416
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:01,699
God bless.

417
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:03,699
What a nice dream.

418
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:09,539
May it be a blessing from Allah.

419
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:11,779
Amen.

420
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,499
May Allah give us a life in good faith,

421
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:18,379
and martyrdom at the end.

422
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:20,899
-Amen.
-Amen.

423
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:25,459
I think about thousands of our martyrs
when I utter the word.

424
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:29,419
However, I don't know why,

425
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:32,619
but I remember a particular one.

426
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,419
I remembered many glorious stories,

427
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:44,059
but also a poor martyr that lived
when the prophet Muhammad was alive.

428
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:48,099
Tell us about him, master. Who was it?

429
00:37:48,659 --> 00:37:49,739
A young man.

430
00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:55,139
Sa'd as-Sülemi.

431
00:37:57,379 --> 00:37:58,979
He had a dark skin.

432
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:02,979
That's why he was sad.

433
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:09,099
His Holiness Sa'd goes to see...

434
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:11,819
our prophet Muhammad one day.

435
00:38:13,899 --> 00:38:15,379
He's deep in thought,

436
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:17,539
and a bit sad.

437
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,339
He asks thus, "O prophet,

438
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:26,139
would the color of my face prevent me
from getting into heaven?"

439
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:32,299
Our prophet Muhammad responds,

440
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:37,739
"I swear on the all-powerful Allah

441
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:41,339
that if you show reverence to Allah

442
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:45,819
and stay on the path of his messenger,

443
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:50,979
none of this shall prevent you
from going to heaven."

444
00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:58,539
His Holiness Sa'd bared his soul
to the prophet Muhammad. He spoke thus,

445
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:02,499
"Then, O prophet, why do people
look down on me?

446
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:07,219
Why doesn't anybody give me
the hand of their daughter?"

447
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:12,979
And the prophet Muhammad answered thus,

448
00:39:13,939 --> 00:39:15,979
"Go to the house of Amr ibn Vehb.

449
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:22,859
Tell him that I greet him and want him
to give his daughter to you in marriage."

450
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:29,099
His Holiness Sa'd went to
see Amr ibn Vehb at once,

451
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:32,579
as the prophet Muhammad had said.

452
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:37,459
He delivered the prophet Muhammad's words.

453
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,379
Amr wanted to think about it.

454
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:47,419
He said, "Let us discuss it,
and we will give you our answer later."

455
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:54,859
However, his daughter said,
"If the prophet saw it, then I see it too.

456
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,379
We don't have to discuss it, Father."

457
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:03,659
Thus, Amr agreed to him marrying
his daughter.

458
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:10,619
His Holiness Sa'd started
the preparations for the wedding.

459
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:15,419
When he went to the shopping district
to buy presents for his wife,

460
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:17,539
he heard something.

461
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:24,819
The crier of the prophet suddenly
called his subjects to fight

462
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:28,219
against the enemy that sieged the Muslims.

463
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:32,939
His Holiness Sa'd, who had been looking
forward to marrying for years,

464
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:37,379
and had at last realized that wish,
was confused.

465
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,259
Should he stay with his wife
and live a nice life,

466
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:45,539
or take up his sword and fight?

467
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,859
He made the hard choice.

468
00:40:52,979 --> 00:40:56,859
He bought a sword with the money
he had saved for the presents.

469
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:02,419
He mounted his horse
and joined the army at once.

470
00:41:02,779 --> 00:41:08,179
Fighting with all his might,
his Holiness Sa'd jumped off the horse,

471
00:41:08,379 --> 00:41:12,579
rolled up his sleeves, and
continued fighting on foot.

472
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:18,659
At last, his Holiness Sa'd
fell as a martyr.

473
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:25,659
The prophet discovered his lifeless body.

474
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:31,579
In a sad tone, he said
to those around him:

475
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:36,019
"Take Sa'd's sword, his spear,
and his horse

476
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:40,379
and hand them to the poor woman
who wanted to marry him.

477
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:42,979
And tell her father that

478
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:49,059
the man he refused as a husband
for his daughter because of his skin tone

479
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:52,659
is now married to the <i>houris</i> in heaven."

480
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,459
Martyrdom is a holy position.

481
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:05,139
But to reach it,
one must live a worthy life.

482
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:12,859
His Holiness Sa'd rose above selfishness
and dedicated himself to the way of Allah.

483
00:42:15,819 --> 00:42:20,499
And Allah provided him
with the best martyrdom.

484
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:25,379
He attained the good word
of the prophet Muhammad.

485
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:29,539
May Allah...

486
00:42:30,899 --> 00:42:33,139
help us live our lives in that way,

487
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:39,699
and bless us with martyrdom
on his righteous path.

488
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:43,059
-Amen.
-Amen.

489
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,099
Wait over there, Temüge.

490
00:43:57,499 --> 00:43:58,819
Come then, my doe.

491
00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:20,579
Did you come to show off
your strength? Sit.

492
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:42,379
As I lifted my head, which I had never
bowed before, and gazed at the Sky God,

493
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,499
I saw dark clouds over great mountains.

494
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,259
I threw bone marrow into the fire

495
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:52,939
and asked the spirits
what this vision means.

496
00:44:53,939 --> 00:44:59,859
They said it was the anguish of
a great doe grieving over a dead brother.

497
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:05,779
Do you want to take revenge that much?

498
00:45:06,859 --> 00:45:09,939
Just like the fire that needs air
to grow in strength,

499
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:12,579
revenge is what I need.

500
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,859
My beating chest...

501
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:22,019
will only be soothed
when I've avenged my brother.

502
00:45:23,979 --> 00:45:27,379
I will give you the opportunity
to avenge him. Don't worry.

503
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,299
How will you do that?

504
00:45:30,299 --> 00:45:34,459
For us Mongols, comrades are
no mere stranger met on the road.

505
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,739
Albastı was a true comrade to us.

506
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:42,379
It's a matter of honor for us
to avenge him.

507
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:46,539
And don't you forget, Sırma Hatun.

508
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:50,499
A Mongol only lives for his honor.

509
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:55,859
And how will you do that?

510
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:58,539
Ertuğrul controls the whole region.

511
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:02,579
He has beaten and
incapacitated all of his enemies.

512
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:08,819
Ertuğrul is nothing but some margrave
being spoiled by the imbeciles here.

513
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:12,179
The bag on a Mongol's horse
contains the heads

514
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:17,059
of many chieftains, and even khans.

515
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:21,259
Everybody shall witness
the might of the Mongols.

516
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:24,499
I sent for the commander in Konya already.

517
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:29,979
They will march to Söğüt and show
the enemy how mighty the Mongols are.

518
00:46:30,699 --> 00:46:33,099
I don't care what you do to Söğüt.

519
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:36,419
I want to avenge my brother.

520
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:39,819
And I know what I need to do.

521
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:42,219
And what might that be?

522
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:45,259
There will be a ceremony soon at the camp.

523
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:50,899
If I get to choose
the new chieftain rather than my sister,

524
00:46:51,299 --> 00:46:53,299
we will be able to do anything we want.

525
00:46:56,259 --> 00:47:00,339
A passionate woman sets
the whole world ablaze.

526
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:02,179
I like you, my doe.

527
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:08,259
Your duty is to remove your sister
from the seat of chieftain.

528
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:13,259
Obviously we need chiefdoms
that carry the torch for us.

529
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:16,659
But it won't be easy.

530
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:20,419
Everyone swore allegiance to my sister.

531
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:24,859
Plus, our chiefs are loyal
to Ertuğrul Bey as well.

532
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:28,259
And those who were loyal to my brother...

533
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:31,379
have lost their nerve after
what happened recently.

534
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:34,899
We must set them on fire first.

535
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:37,579
And I know how to do that.

536
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:40,899
How is that?

537
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:44,739
Gold.

538
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:57,579
You really are Albastı's sister.

539
00:47:57,939 --> 00:48:03,779
You know that everything has a price,
be it things or people.

540
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:09,739
Temüge, prepare a chest of gold at once.

541
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:17,619
Start working towards
taking over your tribe,

542
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:21,019
and get it done before our armies arrive.

543
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:26,859
And don't forget that you have
the utmost support of the Mongols.

544
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,659
It must be the spy my father spoke about.

545
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,019
That must be him.

546
00:49:10,939 --> 00:49:15,299
He must be committing some treachery
with that weasel face of his.

547
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,619
We will see, Gündüz Alp.

548
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,059
Thank you.

549
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:51,019
He's coming.

550
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,019
I will take it.

551
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,099
Oh! It smells nice. Thank you.

552
00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:14,099
I prepared a nice room for you, as well.
I will show you to your room after dinner.

553
00:50:14,899 --> 00:50:17,219
Good. Wait a second.

554
00:50:21,379 --> 00:50:23,499
Take this...

555
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:29,259
and if we have a good night's rest,
you will get another in the morning.

556
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:33,699
May Allah bless you on your journey.
May Allah protect you and your loved ones.

557
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:35,259
Thank you.

558
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:10,059
That spy went after someone, Gündüz Alp.

559
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:13,059
Gives me the creeps.

560
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:17,859
Apparently, they will have a secret talk.
The one that came could be Arıkbuka's man.

561
00:51:18,419 --> 00:51:20,979
Okay. Let's follow them.

562
00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:54,099
You must reap what you sow,

563
00:51:54,259 --> 00:51:56,859
and in Oğuz traditions,
everybody migrates someday.

564
00:51:57,539 --> 00:51:59,819
The generous provide heaven on earth.

565
00:52:03,219 --> 00:52:05,019
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

566
00:52:09,779 --> 00:52:11,299
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

567
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:15,459
-Here, my dear.
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

568
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:35,059
It's been a long while
since I saw such a nice dinner.

569
00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:38,739
Thank God for bringing all of us together.

570
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:41,619
-Amen.
-Amen.

571
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,859
May Allah bless you
with many more years, Mother Hayme.

572
00:52:47,019 --> 00:52:49,939
I hope you enjoy many more
nice dinners such as this.

573
00:52:50,939 --> 00:52:52,259
I hope so, dear.

574
00:52:54,899 --> 00:52:58,539
I also hope that we will be
even happier very soon.

575
00:53:06,259 --> 00:53:09,819
There's a promise I made,
and a wish we will realize.

576
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:16,139
It's high time we conclude that.

577
00:53:23,379 --> 00:53:24,979
We've been through a lot.

578
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:28,979
There's no reason to wait any longer.

579
00:53:34,699 --> 00:53:38,459
From now on, İlbilge Hatun
shall be the lady of our tribe.

580
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:47,019
Being wedded to the legacy
of Süleyman Şah

581
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:52,059
and marrying a man of Ertuğrul Bey's
stature makes me happy.

582
00:53:56,579 --> 00:53:58,299
There is abundance in marriage.

583
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:02,419
May you live in abundance.

584
00:54:03,499 --> 00:54:04,579
Thank you, Brother.

585
00:54:05,299 --> 00:54:08,099
-Amen.
-As you join the Kayi Tribe,

586
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,179
we will have gained Umur Bey's girl too.

587
00:54:11,979 --> 00:54:14,219
The joy goes both ways, dear.

588
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:18,299
When you are in Ertuğrul Bey's tent,

589
00:54:18,419 --> 00:54:20,619
you will shine like the sun,
İlbilge Hatun.

590
00:54:23,739 --> 00:54:27,139
Let's tell the women
to start the preparations at once.

591
00:54:27,459 --> 00:54:29,899
We are about to leave
for an important mission.

592
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:34,339
Start when I return, Selcan.

593
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:39,859
It's been a while since we lit a fire
and cooked to celebrate a marriage.

594
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:50,059
Come back soon, so that we can
start the preparations, Son.

595
00:56:11,939 --> 00:56:13,699
They went in, Head Alp Bamsı.

596
00:56:25,259 --> 00:56:30,019
There's no sound inside. They are
plotting something. Let's go in.

597
00:56:30,139 --> 00:56:34,019
Shouldn't we wait, Head Alp Bamsı?
It could be dangerous.

598
00:56:34,379 --> 00:56:36,619
We can't let the man we found
escape our grasp.

599
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:40,659
They will get away if we let them
out of the room.

600
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:43,099
We must attack while
we have them cornered.

601
00:56:43,819 --> 00:56:44,899
Come on.

602
00:56:58,779 --> 00:57:01,859
Günküt, are you sure they came in here?

603
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:04,619
I saw it with my own eyes,
Head Alp Bamsı.

604
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:10,419
They can't have disappeared into thin air.

605
00:57:21,459 --> 00:57:23,179
What are you doing, Head Alp Bamsı?

606
00:57:23,979 --> 00:57:25,619
What are you looking for on the walls?

607
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,779
There must be a secret passage
through the walls.

608
00:57:33,939 --> 00:57:36,619
Otherwise, they couldn't
disappear like this.

609
00:57:53,459 --> 00:57:55,259
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

610
00:58:07,899 --> 00:58:10,139
Those moles must have used this hole.

611
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:12,539
Come on, let's go.

612
00:58:42,979 --> 00:58:45,539
We must take this letter to Hülagü Khan.

613
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:49,619
Arıkbuka's orders are absolute.

614
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:53,859
I need to depart before sunrise.
You should eat and rest.

615
00:58:54,219 --> 00:58:55,579
We will deal with the rest.

616
00:58:55,779 --> 00:58:57,699
Arıkbuka protected Alıncak's dignity.

617
00:58:57,899 --> 00:59:00,859
Turns out it was the Turk Ertuğrul Bey
who was behind everything.

618
00:59:32,899 --> 00:59:36,739
This is the news they were going to send.

619
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:43,459
They can send their dead bodies
as news now.

620
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:47,379
Let's get back before our dinner
goes cold, everyone.

621
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,659
Come on.

622
00:59:49,739 --> 00:59:50,699
Let's go.

623
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:03,179
We will marry when I'm back
from this mission, İlbilge Hatun.

624
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:11,899
But before that, we need you
to transfer the seat you are occupying.

625
01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:14,059
I thought about that, too.

626
01:00:15,419 --> 01:00:17,259
I inherited it from my forefathers,

627
01:00:17,419 --> 01:00:20,259
and I want to leave it
to a suitable successor.

628
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:25,219
That's the right move, İlbilge Hatun.

629
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:29,659
But you must not let
your guard down in doing so.

630
01:00:30,139 --> 01:00:33,419
Don't worry, I'm thinking things through.

631
01:00:37,779 --> 01:00:40,419
There's still the threat of Arıkbuka.

632
01:00:43,299 --> 01:00:48,059
The Mongols could sustain their reign
over this land with the men they buy.

633
01:00:50,299 --> 01:00:52,659
I doubt they'd dare attempt anything.

634
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:56,619
What about Sırma Hatun?
What does she think about this?

635
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:00,139
I had a word with her.

636
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:04,859
She will do nothing
without telling me first.

637
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:07,459
She knows I won't tolerate any mistakes.

638
01:01:11,499 --> 01:01:15,779
You should still compare the candidates
for the chiefdom thoroughly.

639
01:01:17,939 --> 01:01:20,539
Designate a chief who's close to you.

640
01:01:20,939 --> 01:01:22,339
Support him in the meeting.

641
01:01:24,459 --> 01:01:25,779
I have someone in mind.

642
01:01:26,979 --> 01:01:28,539
I will talk to him at once.

643
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:45,419
Did you send for me, Sırma Hatun?
What happened?

644
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:50,219
As you know, my sister will be
wedded off to the Kayi Tribe soon.

645
01:01:50,979 --> 01:01:53,019
That's why we will have
a chiefdom meeting.

646
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:56,459
As a loyal chief of Beybolat Bey,

647
01:01:56,779 --> 01:02:00,539
I thought you wouldn't want to give
his seat to those who betrayed him.

648
01:02:04,419 --> 01:02:07,339
The untimely death of Beybolat Bey
saddened us all.

649
01:02:07,979 --> 01:02:09,779
None of us would have wanted that.

650
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:12,299
However, the truth is out there.

651
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:17,899
We have no chance against a chief
that gets İlbilge Hatun's support.

652
01:02:18,859 --> 01:02:21,139
I see you give up easily, Taşkun Bey.

653
01:02:22,219 --> 01:02:26,979
But I thought you were a man
who could overcome any difficulty.

654
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:33,019
And I think it'd suit you
to be the chieftain.

655
01:02:36,139 --> 01:02:38,819
But I see that Ertuğrul
destroyed your hopes.

656
01:02:42,579 --> 01:02:47,659
My poor brother, he trusted in men
who wouldn't even avenge him.

657
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,019
If you want to avenge your brother,

658
01:02:53,379 --> 01:02:56,099
then tell me how we can break through
the solid doors of loyalty

659
01:02:56,179 --> 01:02:58,579
our chiefs have for
Ertuğrul and İlbilge Hatun.

660
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,579
I have just the right key...

661
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:26,779
to lock many doors,

662
01:03:27,379 --> 01:03:30,179
and open other solid ones.

663
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:46,139
This should convince the chiefs.

664
01:03:47,979 --> 01:03:49,619
But I'm not convinced yet.

665
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:55,899
Chiefdom is a burning seat to sit on.

666
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:00,939
Why would I risk burning myself?

667
01:04:03,259 --> 01:04:05,019
I like to stay chilled, Sırma Hatun.

668
01:04:12,739 --> 01:04:14,659
Would my heart give you that chill?

669
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:21,419
Why do you look surprised?

670
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:24,499
I know you've been eyeing me for years.

671
01:04:26,979 --> 01:04:29,499
You wouldn't dare ask for my hand
since I was Umur Bey's daughter.

672
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:32,739
However...

673
01:04:33,979 --> 01:04:35,219
this is your chance.

674
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:39,139
Become a chieftain and take the girl.

675
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:12,928
What's wrong, Osman?
What are you brooding over?

676
01:05:13,848 --> 01:05:14,928
You know what.

677
01:05:16,008 --> 01:05:17,768
My father is going out
on a mission again.

678
01:05:19,648 --> 01:05:22,808
It must be an important mission,
since he's all fired up.

679
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:25,608
I wonder where he's going.

680
01:05:26,248 --> 01:05:27,448
He never tells us.

681
01:05:30,048 --> 01:05:31,128
I'm coming in.

682
01:05:33,928 --> 01:05:35,208
What is it, my boys?

683
01:05:36,288 --> 01:05:38,648
What are you
talking about between brothers?

684
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,248
You said you were going
on a mission, Father.

685
01:05:44,008 --> 01:05:45,728
That it would be a long journey.

686
01:05:50,128 --> 01:05:52,528
We'd like to know where you are going.

687
01:05:56,728 --> 01:05:58,088
Come here.

688
01:06:04,568 --> 01:06:06,208
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

689
01:06:08,248 --> 01:06:09,208
Father.

690
01:06:11,808 --> 01:06:16,048
You often tell us exactly what to do,
while other times you say nothing.

691
01:06:18,248 --> 01:06:20,968
Why do you have to keep
where you are going a secret from us?

692
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:26,808
It's a necessity of the seat I sit on.

693
01:06:27,128 --> 01:06:29,648
I can't mix up my roles
as a father and as a chieftain.

694
01:06:32,368 --> 01:06:36,288
If you want to be a chieftain,
you must know how to be discreet.

695
01:06:39,168 --> 01:06:44,248
Plus, our great prophet says: "Hold
your tongue, and you shall be delivered."

696
01:06:46,008 --> 01:06:49,408
Speech is silver, but silence is gold.

697
01:06:53,488 --> 01:06:58,128
Words are of such value that
they should never be wasted.

698
01:07:01,168 --> 01:07:04,008
We represent a great cause,
for which we wouldn't hesitate

699
01:07:04,088 --> 01:07:05,968
for a second to lay down our lives.

700
01:07:08,168 --> 01:07:11,808
We can't just utter anything
to anyone and anywhere.

701
01:07:17,768 --> 01:07:19,928
It's not because I don't trust you.

702
01:07:20,448 --> 01:07:22,208
It's just a matter of being a chieftain.

703
01:07:23,728 --> 01:07:26,528
In the seat of a chieftain,
one must keep secrets.

704
01:07:29,328 --> 01:07:31,928
You will both become chiefs in the future.

705
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:38,008
Decide what to tell and to whom,
not based on your selfish judgement,

706
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:40,208
but in a manner befitting a chief.

707
01:07:42,488 --> 01:07:43,648
Got it, Father.

708
01:07:45,128 --> 01:07:46,048
Got it, Father.

709
01:08:11,528 --> 01:08:12,728
Thank you.

710
01:08:14,688 --> 01:08:15,648
Dear.

711
01:08:25,248 --> 01:08:26,488
Spring is upon us.

712
01:08:27,408 --> 01:08:31,608
Everyone in the tribe has started
preparations for the spring celebrations.

713
01:08:31,848 --> 01:08:34,248
They're getting ready
to go up to the highlands.

714
01:08:35,608 --> 01:08:37,208
I already miss our tribe.

715
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:39,768
What's wrong, Selcan?

716
01:08:40,568 --> 01:08:41,848
Do you feel unwell here?

717
01:08:42,728 --> 01:08:44,208
Not at all, dear.

718
01:08:45,328 --> 01:08:47,408
I consider this tribe as my own.

719
01:08:48,008 --> 01:08:51,088
Mother Hayme makes me feel
like one her daughters.

720
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:55,248
But my fate is tied with my own tribe.

721
01:08:56,688 --> 01:08:59,888
Then why the yearning now, my love?

722
01:09:00,728 --> 01:09:02,368
It's not just now, dear.

723
01:09:02,608 --> 01:09:04,568
I've always had that yearning.

724
01:09:07,408 --> 01:09:08,448
My İltekin.

725
01:09:09,528 --> 01:09:11,048
I miss him.

726
01:09:12,368 --> 01:09:15,128
I always hoped he'd come here,
following us.

727
01:09:15,528 --> 01:09:17,968
But I couldn't see him here, either.

728
01:09:21,368 --> 01:09:25,768
I buried a son under the earth,
and the other within my heart.

729
01:09:34,808 --> 01:09:37,208
You refuse to talk about İltekin too.

730
01:09:37,448 --> 01:09:40,888
How is he? Does he get along well
with his uncles?

731
01:09:41,328 --> 01:09:43,488
Of course he does.

732
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:48,248
He grew up to be a fine man,
he's so reliable.

733
01:09:48,888 --> 01:09:52,208
We fought the Mongols many times,
and never once has he backed down.

734
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:53,488
God bless.

735
01:09:55,808 --> 01:09:57,968
They say a son takes after his father.

736
01:09:58,128 --> 01:10:01,888
He must be a nimble, unflinching
man like you.

737
01:10:04,328 --> 01:10:05,968
But I miss him so much.

738
01:10:08,888 --> 01:10:11,688
Once we are through with all the trouble,

739
01:10:12,768 --> 01:10:14,928
we'll meet our son, too.

740
01:10:16,608 --> 01:10:17,888
I hope so, dear.

741
01:10:34,288 --> 01:10:35,848
<i>May I enter, sister?</i>

742
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:37,408
Come in, Sırma.

743
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:46,048
What happened? What are you
so alarmed about? Is there news?

744
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,008
On the contrary.
Do you have any news, sister?

745
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:51,048
You resent me, but I'm waiting
for your news, worrying.

746
01:10:53,488 --> 01:10:57,128
I told you to stop bringing it up.
But you won't understand, will you?

747
01:10:57,408 --> 01:10:59,208
Chiefdom is one thing,
sisterhood is another.

748
01:10:59,448 --> 01:11:03,248
I have a sister, too, and she's getting
married. How could I contain my joy?

749
01:11:04,808 --> 01:11:06,208
What does Ertuğrul Bey say about it?

750
01:11:06,648 --> 01:11:08,848
Tell me, do you want me
to die of curiosity?

751
01:11:15,328 --> 01:11:17,568
He wants to carry out his promise.

752
01:11:18,528 --> 01:11:20,248
I knew he'd do that.

753
01:11:21,128 --> 01:11:24,288
Let me send news to the women,
and have them start preparations.

754
01:11:24,888 --> 01:11:25,768
After all...

755
01:11:26,008 --> 01:11:29,928
our crown princess is marrying
the chieftain of the Umuroğulları tribe.

756
01:11:32,168 --> 01:11:35,048
Ertuğrul Bey is going out
on an important mission.

757
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,728
Once he's back safe and sound,
we'll start the preparations.

758
01:11:41,488 --> 01:11:45,408
We'll choose the new chieftain of
our tribe. We'll hold a meeting tomorrow.

759
01:11:46,328 --> 01:11:48,528
The future of our tribe comes first.

760
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:51,568
Once that's fulfilled, the rest is easy.

761
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:53,968
You know best, sister.

762
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:57,008
State your wish and we shall follow.

763
01:11:57,528 --> 01:12:00,288
But I'll check our supplies just in case.

764
01:12:00,488 --> 01:12:02,568
I want to sew a fitting wedding
dress for my sister.

765
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:21,288
Allah, help me come back
from this hardship safe and in glory.

766
01:13:23,928 --> 01:13:28,168
The future and hopes of my nation
depend on this journey of mine.

767
01:13:29,608 --> 01:13:34,408
Please help me carry this burden
on my shoulders in a fitting manner.

768
01:13:35,888 --> 01:13:40,368
Don't let me humiliate myself,
and lose to our enemies.

769
01:13:49,528 --> 01:13:50,488
Amen.

770
01:14:20,848 --> 01:14:22,368
May Allah accept your prayers.

771
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:23,968
Amen.

772
01:14:24,688 --> 01:14:26,328
Our men are ready and waiting for us.

773
01:14:30,608 --> 01:14:31,728
Thank you, brother.

774
01:14:41,048 --> 01:14:43,328
I, too, once left the camp

775
01:14:43,888 --> 01:14:46,688
to resist the Mongols in the mountains.

776
01:14:47,328 --> 01:14:49,288
And I looked back
at my tent just like that.

777
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:53,928
You may not return, brother.

778
01:14:55,728 --> 01:15:01,448
But if I ever returned, I swore
to punish all the cruel bastards.

779
01:15:05,688 --> 01:15:09,568
When I'm back, we'll fulfill your oath
together, brother.

780
01:15:10,688 --> 01:15:12,488
I hope so, brother.

781
01:15:14,728 --> 01:15:17,848
I have a long journey ahead.
Will you give me your blessing?

782
01:15:19,008 --> 01:15:19,968
God bless you.

783
01:15:26,848 --> 01:15:29,608
<i>-May I enter, sir?</i>
-Come in, Turgut.

784
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:44,888
Sir.

785
01:15:45,488 --> 01:15:48,048
I heard you were departing
on a long journey.

786
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:53,808
I'm ready, too.

787
01:15:57,128 --> 01:16:00,848
I can't just rest when
you are going on a mission.

788
01:16:06,768 --> 01:16:08,248
My brave brother.

789
01:16:09,488 --> 01:16:11,528
You must heal your wounds.

790
01:16:14,648 --> 01:16:16,728
No missions until you heal.

791
01:16:18,728 --> 01:16:23,888
If you want me to rest, we often
sleep on the horses on our way to battle.

792
01:16:24,568 --> 01:16:26,248
I shall rest there again.

793
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:30,568
In times of hardship, a brave man
can't rest, as they say.

794
01:16:31,528 --> 01:16:36,368
I'm well enough to swing my axe
and fight, sir.

795
01:16:37,688 --> 01:16:40,648
Plus, if I don't come along,

796
01:16:41,528 --> 01:16:43,808
I know my wounds will stop healing.

797
01:16:44,608 --> 01:16:46,208
You know me well, sir.

798
01:16:46,888 --> 01:16:48,288
Let me come with you.

799
01:16:56,848 --> 01:16:58,088
God bless my brother.

800
01:16:59,608 --> 01:17:01,848
Fine. Come with me.

801
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:06,968
But stay with my brother, Gündoğdu,
and not with me.

802
01:17:10,008 --> 01:17:11,848
My journey is much too long.

803
01:17:13,728 --> 01:17:16,408
It'd be better for you to
stay with Gündoğdu.

804
01:17:19,488 --> 01:17:20,488
Thank you, sir.

805
01:17:23,288 --> 01:17:24,248
As you command.

806
01:17:34,968 --> 01:17:36,648
You sent for me, İlbilge Hatun?

807
01:17:37,728 --> 01:17:40,288
Battal Bey, you are my father's comrade.

808
01:17:40,728 --> 01:17:42,288
There's an important issue.

809
01:17:42,528 --> 01:17:46,128
I'd like to consult you and
make my plans accordingly.

810
01:17:47,248 --> 01:17:49,248
Your word is absolute. Do tell me.

811
01:17:54,328 --> 01:17:57,848
As you know, I represent the chieftain
in place of my brother.

812
01:17:58,848 --> 01:18:01,688
But soon, I'll be the wife of
the Kayi chieftain.

813
01:18:03,608 --> 01:18:06,728
I'd like to choose the real chieftain
in our meeting.

814
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:12,208
I want to choose someone
that knows us and our traditions

815
01:18:12,808 --> 01:18:14,448
for the seat of chieftain.

816
01:18:15,288 --> 01:18:19,488
You've been a loyal subject
of my father since you became a soldier.

817
01:18:20,448 --> 01:18:23,008
I've no doubt that you'll
make a great chieftain.

818
01:18:26,408 --> 01:18:28,808
It's an honor for me, İlbilge Hatun.

819
01:18:30,128 --> 01:18:34,048
But once the issue becomes who gets to
sit on that seat, it's a free for all.

820
01:18:34,368 --> 01:18:37,328
Plus, people still can't get over
the fact that Beybolat Bey is dead.

821
01:18:41,048 --> 01:18:42,728
Do you think the chiefs would accept me?

822
01:18:44,688 --> 01:18:46,408
Don't worry about it, Battal Bey.

823
01:18:47,088 --> 01:18:50,208
You have my support and Ertuğrul Bey's.

824
01:18:52,368 --> 01:18:56,568
We can't hand this seat to someone
we don't trust at a time like this.

825
01:18:57,368 --> 01:18:59,008
You should talk to the other chiefs.

826
01:19:00,048 --> 01:19:01,608
And let them know about my decision.

827
01:19:02,288 --> 01:19:04,088
As you command, İlbilge Hatun.

828
01:19:48,448 --> 01:19:49,568
Arıkbuka!

829
01:19:53,128 --> 01:19:54,168
Arıkbuka!

830
01:19:59,248 --> 01:20:01,488
My prey got away because of you.

831
01:20:01,688 --> 01:20:03,688
If it's a trivial matter,
you become my prey.

832
01:20:04,088 --> 01:20:05,688
It's about Ertuğrul and Gündoğdu.

833
01:20:08,048 --> 01:20:09,848
-What about them?
-They left their camp.

834
01:20:10,288 --> 01:20:13,048
-They're going in different directions.
-Which way?

835
01:20:13,248 --> 01:20:16,648
Ertuğrul goes east,
while Gündoğdu goes north.

836
01:20:23,688 --> 01:20:25,848
If Gündoğdu is going north,

837
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:29,528
it means he'll meet Berke Han's men.

838
01:20:30,288 --> 01:20:31,208
What about Ertuğrul?

839
01:20:31,848 --> 01:20:35,328
If Ertuğrul Bey is not going
to take Berke Han's cargo,

840
01:20:35,528 --> 01:20:38,408
he must be going somewhere
even more important.

841
01:20:39,408 --> 01:20:40,568
Where could that be?

842
01:20:41,048 --> 01:20:43,248
If he's going east...

843
01:20:44,808 --> 01:20:46,488
it must be Berke Han.

844
01:20:47,288 --> 01:20:50,088
Plus, Berke's spy Torumtay is dead.

845
01:20:51,728 --> 01:20:54,568
He'll want to meet Berke Han personally.

846
01:20:55,968 --> 01:20:59,608
If that's true, he's no doubt
going to cause trouble.

847
01:21:04,208 --> 01:21:06,888
You've given me
a better prey than that bird.

848
01:21:08,648 --> 01:21:10,288
We can't let Ertuğrul pass.

849
01:21:11,048 --> 01:21:13,408
We must stop him at all costs.

850
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:19,128
Our men at Fox Valley should
take care of Gündoğdu.

851
01:21:19,648 --> 01:21:21,648
Make sure they catch him properly.

852
01:21:27,688 --> 01:21:29,848
We'll go after Ertuğrul.

853
01:21:30,728 --> 01:21:33,248
We're going to set up a trap for him.

854
01:21:33,568 --> 01:21:37,288
So he'll know his death
awaits him at the end.

855
01:22:35,328 --> 01:22:39,208
Thank God we're going to have
the wife of our chieftain around.

856
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,608
That's not what I'm looking forward to,

857
01:22:43,408 --> 01:22:45,248
but that she's the right person.

858
01:22:45,928 --> 01:22:47,368
You are right, mother.

859
01:22:48,008 --> 01:22:52,088
Did you notice? When Ertuğrul Bey
announced his marriage decision,

860
01:22:52,248 --> 01:22:55,208
İlbilge Hatun looked down
in embarrassment.

861
01:22:56,768 --> 01:22:59,608
İlbilge Hatun has a pure heart, dear.

862
01:23:00,328 --> 01:23:03,568
She has the acumen to be
the wife of a chieftain,

863
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:07,928
and the modesty to be a fitting
daughter of a chieftain.

864
01:23:08,808 --> 01:23:11,968
I know for a fact she will be
a fitting woman for our tribe.

865
01:23:16,288 --> 01:23:19,768
Ertuğrul brought up his sons
all by himself.

866
01:23:20,968 --> 01:23:23,448
He was both a mother and a father to them.

867
01:23:24,688 --> 01:23:29,688
I had fears for a long time,
that Ertuğrul would get old alone.

868
01:23:30,888 --> 01:23:35,288
Once İlbilge Hatun came along,
all my fears dispersed.

869
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:40,568
I can die happy now, dear.

870
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,688
Don't say that.

871
01:23:42,928 --> 01:23:45,168
Allah will bestow you a long life.

872
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,168
They're here.

873
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,768
But we can't let our guard down.

874
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:21,328
I took the necessary precautions,
Gündoğdu Bey.

875
01:24:22,888 --> 01:24:24,448
We are in control.

876
01:24:25,648 --> 01:24:26,528
Well done.

877
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:31,768
This is the meeting place.
Did you take precautions?

878
01:24:32,008 --> 01:24:32,968
Don't worry.

879
01:24:34,128 --> 01:24:36,808
Our men came to lie in wait around us.

880
01:24:43,568 --> 01:24:44,488
Good.

881
01:24:50,968 --> 01:24:53,128
They will mistake us for
Berke Han's men at first.

882
01:24:53,448 --> 01:24:55,368
We won't lift a finger until
the very last moment.

883
01:24:55,488 --> 01:25:00,408
Then, we'll get them
and catch Gündoğdu alive. Got it?

884
01:25:18,008 --> 01:25:18,888
Here we go.

885
01:26:04,528 --> 01:26:06,568
Did you do as I said, Temüge?

886
01:26:07,648 --> 01:26:10,208
We did.
Everything is ready for the attack.

887
01:26:11,328 --> 01:26:12,448
Let's go, then.

888
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:17,728
I'll make up for the prey I missed
in the forest by hunting Ertuğrul.

889
01:26:56,808 --> 01:26:58,248
Where are your goods coming from?

890
01:26:58,768 --> 01:26:59,688
From overseas.

891
01:27:15,848 --> 01:27:19,008
Take the chests, everyone.

892
01:27:34,848 --> 01:27:37,208
Did you think you could
take the gold and get away?

893
01:27:41,168 --> 01:27:44,168
We'll send your heads
in those boxes to Berke Han!

894
01:27:47,048 --> 01:27:49,248
We'll see who loses their heads!

895
01:27:49,568 --> 01:27:50,528
Attack!

896
01:27:54,648 --> 01:27:55,808
God is righteous!

897
01:28:36,568 --> 01:28:39,528
This place has no floods or storms, sir.

898
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,488
How could these trees fall down?

899
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:44,768
It's Arıkbuka!

900
01:29:28,248 --> 01:29:31,328
I told you I would make life
unbearable for you in this land, Ertuğrul.

901
01:29:33,928 --> 01:29:37,688
I'll haunt you no matter where you run.

902
01:29:38,488 --> 01:29:41,448
It seems you have yet
to understand that you can't hold me down.

903
01:29:43,088 --> 01:29:45,728
So I shall beat it into you
with my sword.

904
01:29:49,848 --> 01:29:52,928
Did you think I wouldn't foresee
your ambush?

905
01:29:56,128 --> 01:29:58,048
It's you who is ambushed.

906
01:30:10,768 --> 01:30:12,808
Attack!

907
01:30:43,928 --> 01:30:44,888
Damn it.

908
01:32:49,528 --> 01:32:51,968
Keep wasting your time here, Ertuğrul.

909
01:32:52,448 --> 01:32:57,048
I'll make this journey a living hell.
You have yet to see my worst trap.

910
01:34:05,688 --> 01:34:08,928
You know what kind of
predicament we are in now.

911
01:34:11,648 --> 01:34:14,208
On the orders of the margrave,
Ertuğrul Bey,

912
01:34:15,048 --> 01:34:17,528
I've been representing
the Umuroğulları Tribe.

913
01:34:18,448 --> 01:34:21,688
However, it is time to elect
the real chieftain.

914
01:34:25,928 --> 01:34:28,768
Who are the candidates
for chieftain of our tribe?

915
01:34:36,168 --> 01:34:37,048
I am.

916
01:34:45,048 --> 01:34:46,008
And I am.

917
01:35:01,048 --> 01:35:03,608
There are two candidates for the seat.

918
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,208
As the representative of the seat,

919
01:35:11,928 --> 01:35:14,568
I ask you in the name of everyone here.

920
01:35:16,648 --> 01:35:19,208
What do you hope to gain
by becoming the chieftain?

921
01:35:24,488 --> 01:35:28,368
We've lost our chieftain
in the most exemplary way.

922
01:35:29,328 --> 01:35:33,128
My wish is to
avoid making the same mistakes

923
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:38,928
and follow our traditions,
hand in hand with Ertuğrul Bey.

924
01:35:44,888 --> 01:35:46,128
That's all I have to say.

925
01:35:49,968 --> 01:35:51,448
What about you, Taşkın Bey?

926
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:56,048
Tradition is absolute, for sure.

927
01:35:56,928 --> 01:36:01,168
However, I don't believe
dominion alone would be enough.

928
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:10,528
I side with the interests of
my people, pastures for our cattle,

929
01:36:11,368 --> 01:36:12,528
and markets for our goods.

930
01:36:16,288 --> 01:36:19,888
In short, I'll conduct
my duty in such a way

931
01:36:20,928 --> 01:36:22,368
as to protect our own interests.

932
01:36:25,248 --> 01:36:26,568
That's all I have to say.

933
01:36:33,688 --> 01:36:37,968
In this meeting we talk,
and we find the truth as we talk.

934
01:36:40,288 --> 01:36:43,688
Everybody has a say in it,
and the chiefs make their decisions.

935
01:36:48,168 --> 01:36:50,168
But let me say just this.

936
01:36:50,848 --> 01:36:53,008
Chiefdom is not carried out for interests,

937
01:36:55,528 --> 01:36:56,808
but for justice.

938
01:37:02,488 --> 01:37:07,208
Not to mention, following tradition
is the ultimate goal.

939
01:37:07,848 --> 01:37:09,888
That's what Battal Bey and I think.

940
01:37:14,648 --> 01:37:16,208
Now, the choice is yours.

941
01:37:33,688 --> 01:37:36,648
Hakkı, see if there's anybody else left.

942
01:38:12,368 --> 01:38:14,608
It was obvious that Arıkbuka
would claim the gold.

943
01:38:14,968 --> 01:38:17,288
The death of Berke Han's spy,

944
01:38:18,248 --> 01:38:21,328
and the fact that Arıkbuka
snatched the gold from us...

945
01:38:22,208 --> 01:38:23,408
was not good on our part.

946
01:38:23,928 --> 01:38:29,008
If we can't take back the gold from
Arıkbuka, we'll lose Berke Han's trust.

947
01:38:31,208 --> 01:38:32,488
And put the alliance in jeopardy.

948
01:38:34,088 --> 01:38:35,688
It'll make things harder for Ertuğrul.

949
01:38:36,608 --> 01:38:38,608
We'll take the gold back at any cost.

950
01:38:39,408 --> 01:38:41,888
We'll search every nook and cranny
in the mountains if we must.

951
01:38:42,408 --> 01:38:44,088
We won't return before we find that gold.

952
01:38:44,648 --> 01:38:45,528
All right.

953
01:38:46,128 --> 01:38:47,168
Got it, sir.

954
01:39:48,928 --> 01:39:50,408
Come, Ertuğrul.

955
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,048
Damn it.

956
01:40:35,768 --> 01:40:37,008
I must leave at once.

957
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:47,928
That heathen will go right back into
his den. We'll follow him.

958
01:40:48,568 --> 01:40:50,608
And take back our gold.

959
01:40:51,568 --> 01:40:53,248
We will not only take our gold,

960
01:40:54,408 --> 01:40:57,008
but also destroy that den.

961
01:41:17,328 --> 01:41:19,848
Come on, let's go.

962
01:41:31,808 --> 01:41:35,888
Who wants to see Battal Bey
as chieftain of the Umuroğulları tribe?

963
01:41:54,688 --> 01:41:56,088
Just two?

964
01:42:09,688 --> 01:42:13,648
Who wants to see Taşkun Bey
as chieftain of the Umuroğulları tribe?

965
01:42:26,288 --> 01:42:28,168
There's no need for us to talk much.

966
01:42:29,448 --> 01:42:31,168
You know what to say.

967
01:42:39,328 --> 01:42:40,368
Thank you, sir.

968
01:42:43,848 --> 01:42:44,888
Thank you, sir.

969
01:42:48,528 --> 01:42:50,048
Thank you, sir.

970
01:42:54,408 --> 01:42:56,368
Thank you, sir.

971
01:43:00,328 --> 01:43:02,488
I want you to repay me in the meeting.

972
01:43:04,248 --> 01:43:05,768
The more loyalty you have,

973
01:43:06,848 --> 01:43:08,048
the richer you get.

974
01:43:08,888 --> 01:43:12,168
If you give me your vote,
when I sit on the throne of chiefdom,

975
01:43:12,848 --> 01:43:14,168
you'll get more of this.

976
01:43:30,728 --> 01:43:32,528
Our chiefs have made their decision.

977
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:36,968
The rest depends on you, İlbilge Hatun.

978
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:53,328
As our meeting dictates,

979
01:43:54,928 --> 01:43:57,808
the new chieftain of the Umuroğulları
Tribe is henceforth Taşkun Bey.

980
01:44:08,368 --> 01:44:09,888
God bless.

981
01:44:35,888 --> 01:44:37,648
Enough running around.

982
01:44:38,368 --> 01:44:40,208
Now is the time for justice.

983
01:44:40,408 --> 01:44:44,248
You failed to get a word out
of me despite your best efforts.

984
01:44:46,448 --> 01:44:50,608
However, I'll make sure you
talk at all costs.

985
01:44:53,168 --> 01:44:55,448
You will do nothing.

986
01:44:56,288 --> 01:45:01,808
You'll die here, while your brother,
Gündoğdu, dies there.

987
01:45:02,088 --> 01:45:03,848
Did you think I wouldn't foresee this?

988
01:45:06,288 --> 01:45:10,008
We'll destroy your ambushes.

989
01:45:12,048 --> 01:45:14,888
I'll also find out who it was
that gave you information...

990
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,568
on Berke Han's side.

991
01:45:19,888 --> 01:45:21,168
You know about it.

992
01:45:23,608 --> 01:45:26,128
But I'll say nothing else.

993
01:45:28,648 --> 01:45:32,968
Hülagü Khan will send his armies
to trample this land.

994
01:45:34,368 --> 01:45:37,648
I know you were going
to meet Berke Han, too.

995
01:45:39,608 --> 01:45:41,768
You'll never make it there.

996
01:45:42,608 --> 01:45:45,808
The information you sent to Hülagü Khan
will never reach him.

997
01:45:48,048 --> 01:45:50,848
My men have already confiscated
that information.

998
01:45:52,568 --> 01:45:57,168
And you shall perish
at the tip of my sword.

999
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:16,900
The chief should pass chiefdom down to me.

1000
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:21,340
It should be you who gives me
the sword of chiefdom.

1001
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:05,020
-Congratulations, sir.
-Congratulations, sir.

1002
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,620
-Congratulations, sir.
-Congratulations, sir.

1003
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:09,660
-Congratulations, sir.
-Thank you, everyone.

1004
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:11,540
Thank you.

1005
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:14,940
My horse is right outside...

1006
01:48:16,780 --> 01:48:18,780
and my chieftain's sword to hand...

1007
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:22,300
Now all I need is a woman.

1008
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:31,900
Now it's time I took one.

1009
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:34,500
What do you mean, Taşkun Bey?

1010
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:37,740
I have nothing to hide.

1011
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:41,740
I'm acting within my power as a bey.

1012
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:47,340
After all,
now that I'm the chieftain,

1013
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:50,420
I need a woman from the bloodline
of a chieftain.

1014
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:55,020
On the commandment of Allah...

1015
01:48:56,420 --> 01:48:58,420
I'd like to marry Sırma Hatun.

1016
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:13,700
What do you say, Sırma Hatun?

1017
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:20,700
Do you want to be the wife
of the chieftain of Umuroğlu Tribe?

1018
01:49:35,620 --> 01:49:38,060
Being the wife of a chieftain...

1019
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:40,700
befits the daughter of a chieftain.

1020
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:45,260
I accept the offer.

1021
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:49,060
What's this? What happened?

1022
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:51,580
That damned Ertuğrul's men
came out of nowhere.

1023
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:08,620
Gündoğdu ambushed us and killed everyone.

1024
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:16,980
-Did anyone see you?
-No.

1025
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:19,220
I played dead.

1026
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:23,300
Come, let's get your wound treated.

1027
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:28,780
It's time.

1028
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:32,700
It's like you said, Turgut,
it's time to destroy their den.

1029
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:34,100
Attack!

1030
01:51:42,180 --> 01:51:43,700
This is as far as you go, Arıkbuka.

1031
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:48,260
If you don't talk...

1032
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:50,860
I'll make you wish you were dead.

1033
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:54,180
Now, tell me.

1034
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:57,900
Who is the spy close to Berke Han?
Who sent the information?

1035
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:01,140
Just when you think you've got me...

1036
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:07,260
I'll see the fear in your face now
when you realize this is a trap.

1037
