00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,774
I will kill you with Kiyat send
your bodies to your owners.

3
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:34,586
I understood that you were doing something when
you set off with soldiers without informing me.

4
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,353
My thoughts were right.

5
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,759
Catch, if you can.

6
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,015
Well done Arikbuka. You did what you could.
Now it's my turn.

7
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:31,429
Go after him!

8
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,173
I will take your life Berke Han.

9
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,429
And i know how to do it.

10
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,894
You were right Ertugrul Bey.

11
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,327
You stopped the
bertrayal with your trap.

12
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:05,921
You did your duty. Now it's my
turn.

13
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,749
I will kill that traitor among us.

14
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,560
We haven't fulfilled our duty.

15
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,280
I will keep following Arikbuka.

16
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,760
I must break his wings before he takes
the news to Hulagu Han.

17
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,648
I will give two trackers to you.
Yuo'll need them.

18
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,734
But don't waste your time.

19
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,218
Because i will send my men to everywhere.
Come to my hunt tent when you're done.

20
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,894
There's no obstacle for our alliance now.

21
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,746
I will give some documents to you.
which will be necessary for the big war.

22
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,209
As you wish.

23
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,920
Come on
We are going back to the hunt tent.

24
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,006
Because there is a hunt waiting for us.

25
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,920
And we'll go after Arikbuka.
Come on Alps!

26
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,162
Untie my hands.

27
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,084
I order you as Sirma Hatun. Untie my hands!

28
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,491
You will listen to your
Hatun's order like this.

29
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,720
Sırma Hatun... Ilbilge Hatun ordered this.

30
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,600
She has another order. You
can't leave your tent.

31
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,000
And these 2 Alps will wait at your door.
If you need anything...

32
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Get out! Out!

33
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,293
I said get out! Get out!

34
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,080
Out!

35
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:45,727
It's not done, Ilbilge Hatun!

36
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
I haven't said my last word!

37
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,080
I will ask about this!

38
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,405
May Allah bless you, Turgut Bey.

39
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,569
Thanks to you, we exposed the bertrayal
and saved our tribe.

40
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,654
EyvAllah Ilbilge Hatun.

41
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,787
Destroying it was our duty.

42
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:23,204
Thanks to Allah, we got rid of the dark clouds above our tribe. Now you should
rule our tribe until you become the Hatun of Kayi tribe, Ilbilge Hatun.

43
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,920
The fur and the tent's is yours.

44
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,760
You are the Bey,  Battal Bey.

45
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,694
You can sit on the Beylic fur whenever you want,
it's halal to you.

46
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,115
EyvAllah. If you allow me.

47
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,647
Ilbilge Hatun.

48
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,920
And there is Sirma Hatu issue.

49
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,194
You will make a decision about her.

50
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,084
Sirma's ambition and anger have always covered
her eyes.

51
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,493
She is like a child who always wants things.

52
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,200
No matter how mad i get at her, I always
have mercy on her.

53
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,867
She might act without thinking.

54
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,200
But we can't make a decision without thinking.

55
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,093
Some time must pass first.

56
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:31,678
Then i'll make a decision about her turgut Bey.

57
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:32,942
EyvAllah.

58
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,780
But you be cautious.

59
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
If you allow me..

60
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Turgut Bey.

61
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,054
How is Ertuğrul Bey?
Did you hear from him?

62
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,248
Did something happen to him, as he is away?

63
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,120
My Bey got rid of many problems,
he will again, inshAllah.

64
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,997
He will come back soon.

65
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,174
You don't worry.

66
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
InsAllah.

67
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,250
I will take important documents from inside.

68
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,427
You can't get in the tent as Berke Han is not
here.

69
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:49,156
Berke Han ordered me, i couldn't come here on my own.

70
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,211
What is the document you'll take?

71
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,201
Mind your own business. I told you
that it is important.
Make way.

72
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,866
Where are those damn documents?

73
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:59,221
You, Ertugrul and Islam world will be destroyed
after Hulagu Han receives the documents.

74
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,914
My Bey... we followed them to here...
but they suddenly disappeared.

75
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,880
Where did they go?

76
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,800
They are talented in covering their track.

77
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,920
We know this place well, Ertugrul Bey.
But it might be hard to find the traces again.

78
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,574
then keep following them.

79
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:17,031
I will go to Berke Han's hunt tent with my Alps.

80
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,562
We will get those important documents.

81
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,882
And we'll see if Kiyat will speak.

82
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Come on.

83
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,293
Come on valiants.

84
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,840
Come on.

85
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,893
I see that you have no face to look at my
face, Sirma.

86
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:28,773
It's questioning time.

87
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,800
tell me.
Why did you do all of this?

88
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,240
I did everything for our tribe sister.

89
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,367
But...

90
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,960
For our tribe, ha?

91
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,820
Look at you...

92
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,507
I always supported you as your sister...

93
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,297
But you always disappointed me.

94
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,742
Your were the dagger on my back when i waited
for you to be the shiled infront of me.

95
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,053
I didn't want this to happen this way sister.

96
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:28,086
I was tricked by the
honour of Bey Hatun.

97
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,593
I thought I knew a lot…

98
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,920
But I was being ignorant.

99
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,480
Our father was a victim in a game.
Our brother died in a shame.

100
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,367
We have no one to give our backs.

101
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,373
Why did you play these games while
could support us as two sisters, Sirma?

102
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,773
I'm telling you, Sirma!

103
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,468
I couldn't understand those games with my
small mind sister.

104
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,947
My greed stopped me from seeing the truth.

105
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:23,694
My fear is not because of being exiled or execuled.

106
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,390
But because of being dismissed from your heart.

107
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,468
I am shallow, you are broad.

108
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,843
I'm on ground, you are above.

109
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,398
Little ones make mistakes, older ones forgive.

110
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,539
You can kill me if you want.

111
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,914
You can make me suffer.

112
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:08,839
But i swear... if you forgive me one
more time, I won't disappoint you.

113
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,027
Open your bright heart to
your dard-destined sister.

114
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,077
I swear, I won't disappoint you.

115
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,774
Let me kiss your hand..

116
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,256
Forgive your ignorant and greedy sister.

117
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:54,220
Punish yourself before the punishment I'll
give you.

118
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:58,470
Burn inside.

119
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,728
Your uncontrollable self might behave.

120
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:24,365
What happened, Turgut? Tell me.

121
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:30,053
Sirma Hatun betrayed after Beybolat, mother.

122
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,100
What are you saying Turgut?

123
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,873
What did she do?

124
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:40,428
She took golds from Mongols and gave
it to Umur Beys.

125
00:18:41,046 --> 00:18:46,436
So taskun Bey attempted to rule with
Mongol golds.

126
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:49,842
Traitors are growing up like plants.

127
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:57,497
EvelAllah we caught the Mongol they
collaborted. We punished him and taskun Bey.

128
00:18:58,514 --> 00:18:59,928
What about Sirma?

129
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,381
Ilbilge Hatun put her in her tent.

130
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,592
She'll make her decision later.

131
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:07,717
Ilbilge Hatun must know a thing.

132
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:12,162
Fortunately, her betrayal was exposed before
it resulted with a disaster.

133
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:17,053
Ilbilge Hatun has been through many sufferings.

134
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:22,170
But she never gave up even when she was betrayed by
her family.

135
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:29,777
I want my Ertugrul to come back and see
Ilbilge Hatun as our tent's Hatun.

136
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:58,676
Bad words annoy people.

137
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:02,996
Pretty words get the snake out of it's
hole.

138
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:06,887
You wanted to forgive me.

139
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,996
But I won't forgive you.

140
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:15,066
You ruined my happiness.

141
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,262
My brother died because of you.

142
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,324
You collaborated with my father's killers.

143
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,293
Now you're being their bride.

144
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:50,730
I will kill you with this poison...

145
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:55,433
...just like how you made life unbearable
for me.

146
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:00,863
You will die.

147
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:18,580
So that Sirma Hatun regrets, you will show
generosity by forgiving her, my Hanim.

148
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:25,815
Forgiveness is sometimes the
best way to educate someone.

149
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,939
Yes Mengu.

150
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:34,338
If punishing the criminal is
justice, forgiving her is grace.

151
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:38,838
She was regretful.

152
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:44,229
She asked forgiveness.
I'd forgive her but..

153
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,276
I have to talk to Beys.

154
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:53,791
She will have a way according to their decision.

155
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,760
Can i come in Ilbilge Hatun?

156
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:57,385
Come in.

157
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:06,085
Sirma Hatun wants to see. She has
important things to say.

158
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,475
She can come in.

159
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,748
Sister...

160
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:28,030
I couldn't tell you before.

161
00:22:29,851 --> 00:22:33,092
But i have important things to tell you.

162
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,327
I want to be alone.

163
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:54,045
You think temuge is the basis.

164
00:22:55,468 --> 00:22:58,913
But it goes up to Arikbuka.

165
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:03,522
The real target is not Umur tent...

166
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:08,389
..it's you and our
margrave Ertugrul Bey.

167
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:22,154
Bring Kiyat to me!

168
00:23:27,694 --> 00:23:32,030
So you were a worm that
was trying to bite us.

169
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:35,139
You were a poison that tried to kill us.

170
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:40,280
Now i will kill that worm.

171
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,319
Where is Kiyat?

172
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:49,952
Kiyat is not here my Han.

173
00:23:50,077 --> 00:23:51,272
What do you mean?

174
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:53,623
Where did he go?

175
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:57,358
He was last seen getting into your tent,
No one saw him again.

176
00:23:58,593 --> 00:23:59,897
Did he get into my tent?

177
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:03,616
He told us that you ordered him my Han.
We couldn't say a thing.

178
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:07,256
I didn't order him.

179
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:14,069
As he got in my tent...

180
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:35,398
Kıyat!

181
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,859
What do they want from us?

182
00:24:49,414 --> 00:24:51,562
Your lives.

183
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:05,187
You will swallow that poision Ilbilge Hatun.

184
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:10,695
You wanted to burn, you'll
die while burning.

185
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,828
Revenge is more powerful than mercy.

186
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:21,496
First you, then Ertugrul...

187
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,469
You will come together at your graves.

188
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:21,757
My Hanim! Sirma Hatun!

189
00:26:27,797 --> 00:26:29,197
She poisoned my Hanim!

190
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:34,983
Doctor Hatuns are not here. We'll take
her to Kayi trabe, Artuk Bey!

191
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:05,209
Did something bad happen, Berke Han?

192
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,266
Yes Ertugrul Bey.

193
00:27:09,256 --> 00:27:11,389
the worst thing happened.

194
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:15,330
Did he understand and run?

195
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,537
I wish he ran alone.

196
00:27:18,006 --> 00:27:21,912
He took the secret documents with him.

197
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:24,631
What was in those documents, Berke Han?

198
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:29,691
My army, my soldiers, my spies' names.

199
00:27:31,874 --> 00:27:38,054
the preparations of the wat that
we'll get in against Hulagu Han.

200
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:43,216
We can get those informations again.

201
00:27:43,944 --> 00:27:48,346
But if Hulagu has them...

202
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:53,084
...the our preparations will be useless.

203
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:57,365
We must catch them before they ran.

204
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:03,037
It's not only a few documents we'll
save, but hopes of innocent people..

205
00:28:03,294 --> 00:28:07,724
..we won't let that war and before it starts.

206
00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:11,559
All soldiers will gather!
Send trackers first.

207
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,537
You will look under of every stone.

208
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:15,607
Search everywhere!

209
00:28:18,652 --> 00:28:21,917
We won't let them escape.

210
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:45,151
What?

211
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:46,593
Kiyat came.

212
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:50,368
Let him in.

213
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:00,846
Arikbuka...

214
00:29:01,151 --> 00:29:03,135
I'm happy that you are safe and sound.

215
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:07,221
Berke Han and Ertuğrul understood who I am.

216
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:09,135
Yes they did.

217
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:13,495
Because you fell into their trap.

218
00:29:17,234 --> 00:29:19,538
Go off of me.

219
00:29:19,984 --> 00:29:23,451
You stayed with Berke Han for years for this.

220
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:29,936
And you are exposed when you are needed the
most.

221
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,686
All of our games are ruined because of you.

222
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,085
There is no need for a man like you!

223
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,843
I brought Berke Han's secret informatons!

224
00:29:44,424 --> 00:29:47,603
We are the ones who ruined games, Arikbuka.

225
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:49,689
What is that?

226
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:53,712
Get your damn dagger off of me, then i'll tell you.

227
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,388
there are secret informations
about Berke Han's army...

228
00:30:09,061 --> 00:30:13,561
..soldiers and war preparations.

229
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:19,889
Ertugrul and Berke Han's game will fall
when we take these to Hulagu Han.

230
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,492
We will tie their hands.

231
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:29,409
How could i come empty-handed?

232
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:33,664
You showed that your training wasn't for nothing.

233
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:38,257
Now we must escape and go to tabriz.

234
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:41,155
You know from which way.

235
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:47,359
Berke Han and Ertuğrul must be after us.

236
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:49,374
What will we do?

237
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,968
We will mislead them.

238
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:55,577
Then we'll set such a trap that..

239
00:30:56,836 --> 00:30:57,936
How?

240
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:19,490
It's good inshAllah...

241
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:21,885
Who are they?

242
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:24,721
They are Umuroglu Alps, mother...

243
00:32:25,214 --> 00:32:26,547
It's good insAllah.

244
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,779
What are they doing here?

245
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,564
Ilbilge Hatun!

246
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,548
Ilbilge Hatun!

247
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,078
Ilbilge Hatun!

248
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:05,485
What happened to Ilbilge Hatun?

249
00:33:05,556 --> 00:33:07,696
Sirma Hatun poisoned her, Hayme mother.

250
00:33:07,992 --> 00:33:10,728
Doctor Hanims were not at tents,
we brought her here.

251
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:12,938
take her to the healing tents.

252
00:33:14,024 --> 00:33:16,054
Hurry!

253
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:37,584
How is She, Artuk Bey?

254
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:39,459
She is not fine, Hayme Hatun.

255
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,827
Did she puke?

256
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:44,077
She didn't Artuk Bey,
I found this bottle in the tent.

257
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:48,124
She threw the poisonous dust into her face.
-Give that to me.

258
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:06,622
Ilcin Hatun, boil Baldiran and Seytantersi herbs.

259
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:10,903
Ilbilge Hatun.. she will live, right, Artuk Bey?

260
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:12,942
It's a poison which is made of Kurtbogan herbs.

261
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:18,057
It's a famous Mongol poison.
It's hard to get rid of it.

262
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:21,785
We'll try, and Allah will give shifa. (health)

263
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,816
You will Look everywhere!

264
00:35:34,437 --> 00:35:36,648
We won't go back before we find them!

265
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,458
We haven't encountered a trace.

266
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:42,236
Apparently he didn't use this way.

267
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:45,788
This way is the shortest one.

268
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:49,494
He must've been here if he wanted to leave fast.

269
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:54,096
My soldiers are looking for him everywhere.

270
00:35:54,455 --> 00:35:56,455
He'll be found soon.

271
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:13,227
-My Han.
-What happened?

272
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:14,837
Could you find a trace?

273
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:19,798
We couldn't find a trace of Kiyat.
But we realized a group of men going to the bay at eat.

274
00:36:19,892 --> 00:36:21,993
What kind of men are they? Did you see?

275
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:25,274
Watchmen couldn't recognize them.

276
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,423
They are Kiyat's men.

277
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:30,173
I guess they'll use the bay at east.

278
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:33,439
That's why he sent his men beforehand, to
take precautions.

279
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:34,778
Or the opposite.

280
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:38,735
They will mislead us.

281
00:36:38,978 --> 00:36:40,720
And they will run by using the west road.

282
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,462
Then we'll go to the both bays, Ertugrul Bey.

283
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:47,493
Secret bay at east is closer to here.

284
00:36:48,243 --> 00:36:49,976
You go there with your Alps.

285
00:36:50,423 --> 00:36:52,023
And I will go to west.

286
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:57,056
they must've set a trap if they'll escape
from west.

287
00:36:57,158 --> 00:36:58,158
Don't worry.

288
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:02,275
I have soldiers who are searching at west.
I will take them with me.

289
00:37:04,635 --> 00:37:05,635
Go now.

290
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:08,747
tell the soldiers at west to wait for me.

291
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:18,843
We will send an information if we catch them.

292
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:24,460
Come on!
-Come on Alps!

293
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,775
the poison affected the body.
She is running a fever.

294
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:53,374
Will she be able to get rid of it Artuk Bey?

295
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,577
She still didn't throw up Hayme Hatun.
Poison is really powerful.

296
00:37:57,804 --> 00:38:00,304
I'm afraid it may harm her lungs.

297
00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:03,163
We must make her throw up.

298
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:05,225
Ilcin Hatun.

299
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,744
Are her eyes red?

300
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:19,074
Yes Artuk Bey.

301
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:21,197
they look red.

302
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,861
Ilcin Hatun bring castor oil.

303
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:26,244
Hurry!

304
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:30,244
Hayme Hatun, we must make her throw up.
Help us.

305
00:38:31,534 --> 00:38:32,682
Sure.

306
00:38:40,938 --> 00:38:41,977
I brought it my Bey.

307
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:45,563
Hayme Hatun make her drink it. We don't have much
time.

308
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:49,469
Ya Allah Bismillah!

309
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:51,422
Come on my daughter.

310
00:38:56,696 --> 00:38:57,937
Come on my dear...

311
00:38:58,305 --> 00:38:59,734
Come on my dear...

312
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,595
Look at those jackals...

313
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,149
They don't look like they are waiting for a ship.

314
00:40:09,512 --> 00:40:12,270
My Bey... Arikbuka is not among them.

315
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:16,285
the other one is not here as well.

316
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:22,740
they lurked as they knew we were
going to come.

317
00:40:25,418 --> 00:40:27,099
We won't kill all of them.

318
00:40:29,191 --> 00:40:34,196
We will learn where the ship will go.

319
00:40:36,238 --> 00:40:37,771
Mind that when you attack.

320
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:41,698
Bamsi.

321
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,097
You know what to do.

322
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,980
I'm going out.
-EyvAllah my Bey.

323
00:40:56,076 --> 00:40:57,466
Come on valiants.

324
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:49,750
Where will Kıyat and Arıkbuka go?

325
00:42:50,827 --> 00:42:52,350
I don't know.

326
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:00,774
Where will they go ?
-Will they come here? tell me?

327
00:43:00,855 --> 00:43:03,150
they won't use here.

328
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:05,618
They will go from west...

329
00:43:08,533 --> 00:43:10,600
Did they set a trap there?

330
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,900
there's no trap.

331
00:43:13,275 --> 00:43:15,071
They will just escape.

332
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:19,282
they didn't set a trap, ha?
I said tell me!

333
00:43:22,244 --> 00:43:28,798
Berke Han will be killed by the swords he trusts.

334
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:43,183
What did that jackal say my Bey?

335
00:43:43,684 --> 00:43:46,484
They dragged Berke Ha n to a death trap Bamsi.

336
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:50,760
We must arraive fast. Come on!

337
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:39,326
Did you encounter Kiyat's trace here?

338
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:40,561
We did, my Han.

339
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,778
Where?

340
00:44:42,332 --> 00:44:44,488
Right here, Berke Han.

341
00:44:54,645 --> 00:45:00,599
I killed all of the soldiers you
sent to look for me Berke Han.

342
00:45:01,028 --> 00:45:02,809
Now it's your turn.

343
00:45:05,192 --> 00:45:06,192
Traitor!

344
00:45:07,614 --> 00:45:10,325
You were with me like my son for years.

345
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:15,067
I gave things that no one could reach.

346
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:17,654
Even a demon would find the right way.

347
00:45:17,873 --> 00:45:19,872
You are worse than a demon.

348
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:26,612
It's not being a demon, it's
loyalty to my Han and my duty.

349
00:45:28,995 --> 00:45:31,065
Did you now understand
why we are powerful?

350
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:35,604
This is worse than death for you Berke Han.

351
00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:41,690
You always said that you'd
sacrifice yourself for me.

352
00:45:43,729 --> 00:45:45,542
Your oath will come true.

353
00:45:46,354 --> 00:45:48,386
But not against my enemies.

354
00:45:48,886 --> 00:45:51,167
You'll die under my sword.

355
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:04,675
Don't be so sure, Berke Han!

356
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,995
You must've heard the name Arikbuka.

357
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,487
If you heard that name ...

358
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:25,526
... you must know that no one
can be saved from my hands.

359
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:27,823
Cruel infidels...

360
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:30,963
....dogs of cruelty...

361
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:39,486
As long as we have our swords and we are
alive, we won't have fear but courage...

362
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:45,901
..we won't be captives but say shahada.

363
00:47:29,253 --> 00:47:35,120
You, who left his ancestors' religion and became
Muslim...

364
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:38,291
...you are fighting your own people...

365
00:47:39,245 --> 00:47:44,502
...this is the torment which the ground and sky sent
upon you.

366
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:48,729
There is only one owner of the
ground and the sky.

367
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:53,166
And he is my Rab.

368
00:47:55,698 --> 00:47:59,886
If you have a plan
HE has a plan too!

369
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:01,674
Attack!

370
00:49:24,303 --> 00:49:27,451
Death has come at you, Berke Han.

371
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:30,646
We'll see your plan now.

372
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:37,451
Allah is Hayy! ( the Eternally Living One)

373
00:49:38,084 --> 00:49:39,286
Ertugrul!

374
00:49:48,122 --> 00:49:49,591
Ertugrul.

375
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:19,137
I will first get what you've stolen from me...

376
00:51:19,981 --> 00:51:23,294
...then your miserable life...

377
00:51:25,981 --> 00:51:27,614
Search him.

378
00:52:00,031 --> 00:52:02,921
You think you will win after killing us.

379
00:52:03,398 --> 00:52:08,453
But we have thousands of Kiyats and Arikbukas.

380
00:52:08,702 --> 00:52:11,897
You will never be able to win Hulagu Han.

381
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:17,422
And we have enough swords for every cruel
person.

382
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:21,992
I will send the news to Hulagu Han.

383
00:52:23,312 --> 00:52:25,843
He will learn this:

384
00:52:27,054 --> 00:52:30,648
Hakk has come, and west has lost.

385
00:53:10,575 --> 00:53:14,778
Make her drink, Ilcin Hatun.
We have to clean her lungs.

386
00:53:15,286 --> 00:53:16,473
All right Artuk Bey.

387
00:53:24,418 --> 00:53:26,621
How is she now, Artuk Bey?

388
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:29,544
Is there anything to be scared of?

389
00:53:29,848 --> 00:53:33,591
We made her drink herbs...

390
00:53:33,824 --> 00:53:36,215
She is not in danger now...

391
00:53:36,606 --> 00:53:40,216
We will wait for her to wake up.

392
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,817
Thanks to Allah.

393
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:51,630
thanks to Allah, my child.

394
00:53:54,036 --> 00:53:56,880
Give me water, Ilcin Hatun. I'll wash my hands.

395
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:09,470
You were a gazelle, but your destiny was
for wolves.

396
00:54:11,233 --> 00:54:16,881
Hang on my brave daughter.

397
00:54:18,123 --> 00:54:19,217
Hang on.

398
00:54:19,975 --> 00:54:21,576
Wake up...

399
00:54:22,873 --> 00:54:24,139
Come on.

400
00:54:41,598 --> 00:54:45,872
There are useful informations in these documents.

401
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:54,427
As we agreed on an alliance,
you can have it.

402
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,955
We showed many efforts for this alliance.

403
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:05,612
Now it's time to collect it's fruits.

404
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:12,877
InsAllah we will save the Islam world from cruels.

405
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:19,979
The important thing is to take lessons from
our mistakes...

406
00:55:20,463 --> 00:55:23,385
...and build future according to that.

407
00:55:23,744 --> 00:55:27,681
Fitna, greed and caring about positions...

408
00:55:27,947 --> 00:55:31,549
...did this to Islam world.

409
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:36,900
Mistakes which harmed Islam world...

410
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:40,916
...were ignored for personal benefits.

411
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,760
Mistakes were seen alright.

412
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:50,283
Allah's justice is the same for everyone.

413
00:55:51,338 --> 00:55:58,291
But thanks to Allah, we aren't one of
those who give up and don't care.

414
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:04,142
And Allah gave His mercy on us.

415
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:13,665
Look.. I am a Mongol.. if i weren't granted with Islam..
i could've been like Hulagu. But what happened?

416
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:19,494
thanks to Allah, it
brought us together.

417
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:24,627
We weren't scared as we were a few,
and we didn't stay back as there were many of them.

418
00:56:25,971 --> 00:56:30,095
If we stay strong against our
mistakes and their cruelties...

419
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:36,135
...and if we can oppose them even
if we are only one person...

420
00:56:37,424 --> 00:56:42,018
... Almighty Allah will
make one of us a thousand.

421
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:57,900
Now i will carry this da'wah's flag
from Desni Kipcak to Frank lands.

422
00:56:59,174 --> 00:57:04,168
And turks in Anatolia and East will come
together under the flag we'll fly, insAllah.

423
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,354
May Allah help us.

424
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,009
Ameen.

425
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:31,363
My daughter.

426
00:58:33,613 --> 00:58:34,926
Are you all right?

427
00:58:36,043 --> 00:58:37,512
I'm burning Mother.

428
00:58:38,371 --> 00:58:39,535
I'm so thirsty.

429
00:58:50,488 --> 00:58:51,550
Here, my daughter.

430
00:58:57,535 --> 00:59:00,043
My pure daughter...

431
00:59:01,683 --> 00:59:03,355
Drink it.

432
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,285
Is it enough?

433
00:59:12,605 --> 00:59:15,043
It's enough mother. thank you.

434
00:59:19,816 --> 00:59:24,004
My beautiful faced. dark
destined daughter.

435
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:26,613
You scared us.

436
00:59:28,058 --> 00:59:33,856
I was so afraid as something bad
was going to happen to you.

437
00:59:35,348 --> 00:59:36,394
Mother...

438
00:59:39,964 --> 00:59:41,214
Sirma?

439
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,886
Sirma is dead my daughter.

440
00:59:51,707 --> 00:59:54,340
Alps buried her next to your brother.

441
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,605
One of them tried to kill our tribe...

442
01:00:00,941 --> 01:00:03,027
..and the other tried to kill me.

443
01:00:06,473 --> 01:00:08,582
But they were my siblings.

444
01:00:12,207 --> 01:00:15,035
I'm now alone in this world.

445
01:00:16,703 --> 01:00:19,007
I have no one.

446
01:00:22,148 --> 01:00:27,593
This is the place...

447
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:32,883
...you belong, you'll live. and you'll die.

448
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:42,851
I always wanted a girl.

449
01:00:43,695 --> 01:00:46,374
And you were raised without a mother.

450
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:51,505
We wll be companions with you.

451
01:00:54,224 --> 01:00:56,318
We will give our backs to eachother...

452
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:59,177
...and carry eachother.

453
01:01:01,451 --> 01:01:03,357
I'm your mother now...

454
01:01:05,357 --> 01:01:07,763
...and you are my daughter.

455
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,880
Thank to Allah.

456
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:53,412
I missed my country's
water and air.

457
01:02:04,364 --> 01:02:05,364
My Bey.

458
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:09,513
Berries, my Bey.

459
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:15,802
I just had them. Here, eat.

460
01:02:21,381 --> 01:02:25,021
Even this fruit has this forest's smell.

461
01:02:29,028 --> 01:02:32,575
Come on valiants. We have to go to the tents.

462
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,638
EyvAllah my Bey.

463
01:02:37,263 --> 01:02:38,575
Father.

464
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:47,248
Now we made an alliance with Berke Han.

465
01:02:48,184 --> 01:02:53,325
But there's one thing you made a promise for.

466
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:55,419
What is that promise?

467
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:57,263
Toy, father.

468
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:01,474
You promised to marry Ilbilge Hatun
after the duty is done.

469
01:03:02,365 --> 01:03:05,685
So? what confuses your mind?

470
01:03:08,732 --> 01:03:13,477
War on one side, and toy on the other side.

471
01:03:13,907 --> 01:03:15,282
How is that going to happen father?

472
01:03:16,407 --> 01:03:19,321
We don't delay our da'wah and our promises, son.

473
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:26,086
One of them will come first, for
sure, but everything has it's time.

474
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:32,665
If you go to the duty before toy. you may not come back.

475
01:03:33,048 --> 01:03:35,118
If you make the toy before, it's the same again.

476
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:38,267
It must be hard for you and Ilbilge Hatun.

477
01:03:41,768 --> 01:03:46,604
Look son, our ancestors said
"Bulls' fortune comes from it's horns."

478
01:03:48,761 --> 01:03:54,221
And our fortune is carrying swords until we die.

479
01:03:54,862 --> 01:04:00,448
Because we volunteered
to fight cruels.

480
01:04:02,822 --> 01:04:05,666
Do Turks have a better wedding than war, my lion?

481
01:04:07,362 --> 01:04:09,714
We all wanted this.

482
01:04:10,315 --> 01:04:12,854
It's not an obligation for us, it's a favor.

483
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:18,190
We will first go to the tent, then we'll
say what to do.

484
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,620
BismillahirRahmanirRahim.

485
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,323
Come on.

486
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:05,890
You are fine, right, my sister?

487
01:05:06,133 --> 01:05:07,968
Thanks to Allah, I am.

488
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,835
May Allah bless you,
You didn't leave me.

489
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:14,328
It's our duty Ilbilge Hatun.

490
01:05:15,352 --> 01:05:19,109
If that happened to us, you would do the same.

491
01:05:20,797 --> 01:05:22,047
Forget that.

492
01:05:22,305 --> 01:05:24,211
Let me boil linden and cinnamon for you.

493
01:05:24,328 --> 01:05:26,477
No my sister, don't bother yourself.

494
01:05:26,999 --> 01:05:31,476
Do you want anything else?

495
01:05:31,758 --> 01:05:32,960
No thank you.

496
01:05:38,984 --> 01:05:40,031
Osman?

497
01:05:41,726 --> 01:05:43,234
What is that?

498
01:05:46,703 --> 01:05:48,523
This is for you Ilbilge Hatun.

499
01:05:50,188 --> 01:05:52,086
Why did you bother, Osman?

500
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:54,211
Why did you tired yourself?

501
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:56,328
Do you remember, Ilbilge Hatun?

502
01:05:57,625 --> 01:06:01,250
I made a promise when you gave me soap
when i was hurt.

503
01:06:03,086 --> 01:06:05,086
I was going to bring a hunt to you.

504
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:10,734
It will be shifa to you InsAllah.

505
01:06:11,913 --> 01:06:13,039
Thank you.

506
01:06:17,969 --> 01:06:19,656
What are those noises?

507
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,507
InsAllah it's good.

508
01:06:21,588 --> 01:06:23,361
InsAllah.

509
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:26,101
Or ... father...

510
01:06:58,383 --> 01:06:59,460
Father..

511
01:07:14,242 --> 01:07:17,008
My father and my brothers came grandmother.
they came back.

512
01:07:42,007 --> 01:07:43,718
Thank to Allah.

513
01:08:01,229 --> 01:08:03,745
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

514
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:07,401
Long live my Ertuğrul Bey!

515
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,761
Long live my Ertuğrul Bey!

516
01:08:11,323 --> 01:08:15,456
Long live my Ertuğrul Bey!

517
01:08:16,237 --> 01:08:18,651
Long live my Ertuğrul Bey!

518
01:08:19,456 --> 01:08:20,620
Hey, mashallah.

519
01:08:20,701 --> 01:08:26,963
Kayi's shining swords brave Alps..
Welcome to your tribe, sons!

520
01:08:27,432 --> 01:08:28,745
thanks mother.

521
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:37,853
- Welcome, father.

522
01:08:38,901 --> 01:08:41,291
- Welcome, father.

523
01:08:51,205 --> 01:08:53,830

01:08:56,862 --> 01:09:00,518
-Welcome. - thanks mother.

525
01:09:00,774 --> 01:09:02,532
-Welcome brother. -thanks.

Welcome.

527

-My brother. -My Bey.

528
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:34,448
Hey mashallah.

529
01:09:40,805 --> 01:09:41,977
Welcome my Bey.

530
01:09:42,059 --> 01:09:43,098
Welcome.

531
01:09:43,377 --> 01:09:47,072
thank you Artuk Bey. thank you Melikshah.

532
01:09:51,551 --> 01:09:53,075
Ilbilge Hatun.

533
01:10:00,637 --> 01:10:03,067
We have things to tell you son.

534
01:10:03,325 --> 01:10:04,801
Let's get in first.

535
01:10:44,098 --> 01:10:46,254
Where is my Gündoğdu brother and Selcan Hatun?

536
01:10:47,036 --> 01:10:49,356
We got the aid with Gundogdu Bey.

537
01:10:50,004 --> 01:10:53,247
And put them where you wanted my Bey, but..

538
01:10:53,801 --> 01:10:55,122
..then we received an information.

539
01:10:55,762 --> 01:10:57,363
And they go back to their tents.

540
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:03,847
İltekin went after Mongols. And
they couldn't hear from him.

541
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:05,731
And Dundar is looking for him.

542
01:11:06,043 --> 01:11:09,754
Gündoğdu went there to rule the tents.

543
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:13,855
He did well.

544
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,160
things will get messy.

545
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:19,340
It will be good for his tribe.

546
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,949
Dundar will come here soon, son.

547
01:11:24,879 --> 01:11:28,012
Dündar married and built his family there.

548
01:11:28,559 --> 01:11:30,918
He won't be like before when he comes back.

549
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:35,168
Stronger and braver
Dundar will be with us.

550
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,918
Ilbilge Hatun.

551
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:56,738
Ilbilge Hatun survived a crisis.

552
01:11:58,489 --> 01:11:59,926
What happened Ilbilge Hatun.

553
01:12:00,989 --> 01:12:03,410
Mongols interfered in Beylic election and..

554
01:12:04,215 --> 01:12:07,684
...attempted to have their own man chosen, Ertugrul Bey.

555
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:11,621
Thanks to Turgut Bey and Gundogdu Bey...

556
01:12:12,442 --> 01:12:13,700
...we got rid of this...

557
01:12:14,254 --> 01:12:18,043
...danger and
ruined their game.

558
01:12:20,356 --> 01:12:24,012
And Sirma, who was burring with the love
of revenge...

559
01:12:24,364 --> 01:12:25,855
... tried to kill me.

560
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:29,434
And she died like she deserved.

561
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:31,903
How are you now?

562
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:34,575
Did they take good care of you in Kayi tents?

563
01:12:36,997 --> 01:12:39,543
May Allah bless them. they took good
care of me.

564
01:12:39,872 --> 01:12:41,887
Thanks to Allah, I'm fine.

565
01:12:42,184 --> 01:12:49,148
We owe you, as you faught for Hakk and the truth
with your bravery and obstinacy.

566
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:58,912
Cruel ones got the punishment they
deserved both in Kayi and Umuroglu tribe.

567
01:13:02,209 --> 01:13:07,686
the world has seen that fighting
devoted people is impossible.

568
01:13:10,154 --> 01:13:14,552
We have torn the dark curtain with our
claws.

569
01:13:17,568 --> 01:13:19,958
We did our duty.

570
01:13:21,482 --> 01:13:27,811
today and coming
days will be new.

571
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,897
But...

572
01:13:33,865 --> 01:13:36,896
...we must keep our promise first.

573
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:41,498
Then we'll go to war with Allah's consent.

574
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:49,363
Mother...

575
01:13:49,834 --> 01:13:54,036
Make preparations for the toy.
Everyone will see.

576
01:13:54,357 --> 01:13:56,896
...how Kayis make a wedding toy.

577
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:01,287
Don't worry, son.

578
01:14:02,412 --> 01:14:09,617
It's our Beylic and Hatun
laws to help the poor.

579
01:14:11,056 --> 01:14:12,941
We will make a wedding...

580
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:16,972
...sacrifice sheeps...

581
01:14:17,456 --> 01:14:21,097
...prepare tables with sherbets...

582
01:14:21,526 --> 01:14:23,589
... even our enemies will admire it.

583
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:26,613
Now it's wedding toy time.

584
01:15:05,035 --> 01:15:08,269
Mashallah to my lads, Mashallah.

585
01:15:09,285 --> 01:15:14,425
Son, look, Your chest will always face the enemy.

586
01:15:14,569 --> 01:15:20,057
And your waist will be strong.

587
01:15:20,138 --> 01:15:21,841
Come on.

588
01:15:22,245 --> 01:15:26,636
Sons, May your hands be always strong!

589
01:15:30,402 --> 01:15:37,621
If you hold it loosely, you lose your sword.
Come on valiants!

590
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:47,252
My Aybars.

591
01:15:47,333 --> 01:15:53,455
Aybars, Don't hold it like you hold books,
hold it with your hearts.

592
01:15:54,337 --> 01:15:57,571
Come on my Aybars. MasAllah lads.

593
01:15:57,743 --> 01:15:59,697
MashAllah lads.

594
01:16:00,892 --> 01:16:02,617
MashAllah.

595
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:19,338
Valiants! Stop a while, listen to me.

596
01:16:25,901 --> 01:16:32,283
I see that you are
talented in attacking.

597
01:16:32,978 --> 01:16:35,689
But u ask now...

598
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:42,345
...how are you going to defend yourselves?

599
01:16:43,237 --> 01:16:46,509
We answer with swords, Bamsi Alpbasi.

600
01:16:47,032 --> 01:16:53,134
EyvAllah Osman, you thought well, but...

601
01:16:53,369 --> 01:16:55,955
Is there any other way to defend yourselves?

602
01:16:56,036 --> 01:16:57,924
And we have our hand shields...

603
01:17:00,955 --> 01:17:06,400
Mashallah.. masAllah my valiant...

604
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,611
Come here with Osman.

605
01:17:12,649 --> 01:17:21,181
Valiants!

606
01:17:22,727 --> 01:17:26,469
Come on valiants.

607
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,110
Hey, MashAllah.

608
01:17:51,038 --> 01:17:53,185
MaşAllah to my lads.

609
01:17:53,341 --> 01:17:56,552
Fight like wolves...

610
01:17:56,633 --> 01:18:01,279
Come on valiants,
you fight too.

611
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:04,834
MashAllah to my lads, MashAllah.

612
01:18:05,051 --> 01:18:08,277
Allah is Hayy.
Allah is Haqq. (the Embodiment of truth)

613
01:18:11,574 --> 01:18:17,956
Come on my lions... masAllah...

614
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:00,938
Selamun Aleykum.

615
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:02,727
Aleykum Selam.

616
01:21:02,808 --> 01:21:05,492
Aleykum Selam my Hodja.

617
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:10,039
What is it Bamsii? Didn't
we hear the war noises?

618
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:20,383
My Hodja. We can't know when we'll go to war.
thus i'm training these young valiants.

619
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,703
A new day is comning my Hodja. the war will come.

620
01:21:24,047 --> 01:21:31,313
And we are training to stop enemies.
-MashAllah.

621
01:21:31,922 --> 01:21:35,594
But, you know that exercising is
not only with swords, right?

622
01:21:36,852 --> 01:21:38,805
What else, my Hodja?

623
01:21:39,117 --> 01:21:44,852
You must always exercise
your heart and mind.

624
01:21:45,672 --> 01:21:52,922
Because wars start
with minds and hearts.

625
01:21:53,937 --> 01:21:56,531
You will first raise the conquest...

626
01:21:57,172 --> 01:22:00,610
...in you hearts..

627
01:22:01,155 --> 01:22:06,383
..then you will fight
in the battlefield.

628
01:22:06,787 --> 01:22:10,077
We are exercising with swords to
strengthen our hands.

629
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:14,662
What should we do to strengthen
our hearts and minds, my Hodja?

630
01:22:15,676 --> 01:22:18,950
The person is valued with what they want..

631
01:22:20,505 --> 01:22:24,318
...not what they are at that moment.

632
01:22:25,052 --> 01:22:30,951
You will aim such good things that...

633
01:22:31,334 --> 01:22:33,865
..your hearts will be good too.

634
01:22:34,099 --> 01:22:40,177
And your minds will be strong.

635
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:45,552
Allah-u Teala says:

636
01:22:46,287 --> 01:22:49,435
"So when you have finished [your duties],
then stand up [for worship]."
[Surah Ash-Sharh 94-7]

637
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:55,981
to do this, you must have good aims and dreams.

638
01:22:56,380 --> 01:23:01,763
As your dreams become supreme,
your efforts grow too.

639
01:23:03,206 --> 01:23:15,788
You will stay at this time with your mind. But
your dreams will affect centuries later.

640
01:23:20,013 --> 01:23:22,490
Dream such things that...

641
01:23:23,489 --> 01:23:26,146
..have such a supreme aim that...

642
01:23:27,638 --> 01:23:30,935
..may that aim look from your eyes...

643
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:37,490
...and may your walk declare that
dream to others that see you.

644
01:23:41,769 --> 01:23:45,138
Do you know Constantine?
-It's Byzantine's city my Hodja.

645
01:23:45,225 --> 01:23:48,318
It's a great city.
It has strong castles.

646
01:23:48,794 --> 01:23:50,677
No one has defeated there, my Hodja.

647
01:23:51,802 --> 01:23:55,669
the Prophet(Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) is reported to have said:

648
01:23:56,112 --> 01:24:06,065
"Verily you shall conquer Constantinople. What a wonderful leader will her leader be, and
what a wonderful army will that army be!' [Musnad Ahmad, Al Hakim, Al Jami' al Saghir]

649
01:24:09,762 --> 01:24:13,412
Be valiants, who have big dreams.

650
01:24:14,802 --> 01:24:18,654
Give your all to be granted with our Prophet's good news.

651
01:24:19,489 --> 01:24:25,544
Even if you are not granted today,
open the ways for your children.

652
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:33,576
Plant such seeds that, they can even
blossom a thousand years later.

653
01:24:36,091 --> 01:24:40,004
May Allah let us to be gained in that good news.

654
01:24:40,152 --> 01:24:41,707
Amen.

655
01:24:42,065 --> 01:24:45,596
-Ameen Ameen.
-Ameen Osman.

656
01:24:46,597 --> 01:24:48,379
However, do not forget.

657
01:24:49,073 --> 01:24:57,199
You have to live a life by following our Prophet
Efendi to be granted with his good news.

658
01:24:59,269 --> 01:25:08,608
Know that nothing is precious
if you are not following him.

659
01:25:12,372 --> 01:25:16,510
EyvAllah my Hodja. You said well.

660
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,644
You look sad, mother.

661
01:25:57,932 --> 01:25:59,534
I'm not sad.

662
01:25:59,917 --> 01:26:01,808
I'm honoured.

663
01:26:03,737 --> 01:26:05,589
Our mortal life...

664
01:26:07,197 --> 01:26:13,175
...passed with serving to this tent,
which is a deposit from Suleyman Sah.

665
01:26:15,526 --> 01:26:20,417
Such happiness, such grief
have been in this tent.

666
01:26:23,214 --> 01:26:27,581
We shedded our tears
on these carpets.

667
01:26:30,066 --> 01:26:34,222
I wonder how much cries of victory this tent hides.

668
01:26:35,885 --> 01:26:39,745
We sometimes fell.

669
01:26:40,651 --> 01:26:46,347
But we always stood up.

670
01:26:50,847 --> 01:26:55,183
Mother.. you survived many problems...

671
01:26:55,816 --> 01:26:57,386
You suffered a lot...

672
01:26:57,910 --> 01:27:00,089
But we always saw you standing tall.

673
01:27:02,433 --> 01:27:08,839
Being a Hatun is not only serving to the tent, my daughter.

674
01:27:10,472 --> 01:27:13,636
Being a Hatun is giving order to the tent..

675
01:27:14,534 --> 01:27:18,128
...giving belief and strength.

676
01:27:18,785 --> 01:27:21,136
Hatun is such a stich that....

677
01:27:23,143 --> 01:27:27,620
...when it falls,
then tent falls.

678
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:36,417
Beys fight...

679
01:27:38,237 --> 01:27:40,980
...but Hatun cooks.

680
01:27:42,581 --> 01:27:45,863
Bey holds the tent...

681
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:49,011
But Hatun orders it.

682
01:27:51,386 --> 01:27:52,761
Bey...

683
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:55,363
...is the mind of the tent...

684
01:27:56,877 --> 01:27:58,995
...and Hatun is the soul of the tent.

685
01:28:11,158 --> 01:28:16,636
You listened to me, learn it well. May
your daughter listen to you too..

686
01:28:17,268 --> 01:28:18,941
...and learn it well.

687
01:28:39,742 --> 01:28:43,226
News have already raised hopes, my Bey.

688
01:28:45,397 --> 01:28:51,226
It's like people were
sleeping but woke up now.

689
01:28:51,641 --> 01:28:55,703
It's the fruits of our efforts.

690
01:28:56,953 --> 01:29:01,492
We were a tribe with 400
tents, but we spreaded.

691
01:29:02,835 --> 01:29:06,312
Many planes will grow from this seeds insAllah.

692
01:29:07,365 --> 01:29:09,158
InshAllah.

693
01:29:31,989 --> 01:29:34,603
-Son. -Father.

694
01:29:40,376 --> 01:29:43,182
Only coal is not enough.

695
01:29:45,627 --> 01:29:47,736
You need a blower.

696
01:29:50,354 --> 01:29:54,494
I wanted to strengthen my sword, father.
We have a toy too.

697
01:30:04,759 --> 01:30:06,689
Come.

698
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:20,736
You will care about your horse and
sword more than anything, son.

699
01:30:22,025 --> 01:30:25,205
Because we became famous with these two.

700
01:30:27,143 --> 01:30:30,260
And we rule them.

701
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,369
See the iron as yourself.

702
01:30:34,682 --> 01:30:37,877
It gets hot as you burn it.

703
01:30:38,509 --> 01:30:41,166
Iron gets sharper as you hit it.

704
01:30:41,494 --> 01:30:45,408
And there is no enemy which a sharp sword can't cut.

705
01:30:50,174 --> 01:30:51,603
What do they say?

706
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:55,680
"Infidels' heads are dough,
turks' heads are iron."

707
01:30:57,673 --> 01:31:01,211
You are right father.

708
01:31:01,664 --> 01:31:04,531
It shouldn't rust, like the hands of valiants.

709
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:13,750
true.

710
01:31:13,852 --> 01:31:18,532
Irons that don't rust and valiants
that don't give up are the best.

711
01:31:21,259 --> 01:31:23,282
take you hammer.

712
01:31:25,954 --> 01:31:31,360
First iron noise,
then qopuz's voise.

713
01:31:34,368 --> 01:31:36,259
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

714
01:31:54,047 --> 01:31:59,282
Look at the bride, She is applying henna on her hands...

715
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:05,159
Don't say anything to the bride,
She might get offended and go back home...

716
01:32:05,425 --> 01:32:10,909
She looks like an angel...

717
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:12,863
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

718
01:32:12,969 --> 01:32:16,790
May your henna be good and your wishes come true.

719
01:32:17,206 --> 01:32:22,636
"Look at the bride, She is applying henna on her hands...

720
01:32:22,836 --> 01:32:28,289
"Don't say anything to the bride,
She might get offended and go back home..

721
01:32:28,378 --> 01:32:34,063
Her door is hennaed...
She looks like an angel...

722
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:45,992
May your henna be good and your wiches come true.
Look at the bride may your wishes come true...

723
01:33:22,365 --> 01:33:24,500
You are shining like the moon, my daughter.

724
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:33,476
May Allah keep you away from bad eyes.

725
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:38,023
Amein Hayme mother.
May Allah bless you

726
01:33:39,445 --> 01:33:42,351
You let me live this peace.

727
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:45,523
May the toy's fruitfulness find us.

728
01:33:45,842 --> 01:33:48,240
Amine.

729
01:33:50,796 --> 01:33:52,515
You look like a fairy Ilbilge Hatun.

730
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:55,623
You will inshAllah build your tent with your
son and daughter.

731
01:33:56,054 --> 01:33:58,179
Amin.

732
01:34:37,945 --> 01:34:39,343
Thanks to Allah my Bey.

733
01:34:39,734 --> 01:34:42,500
We are eating from your toy table.

734
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,289
May Allah keep giving you...

735
01:34:45,647 --> 01:34:48,226
..plentifulness insAllah.

736
01:34:48,312 --> 01:34:50,320
Amin brother. Amin.

737
01:34:51,406 --> 01:34:56,179
We came our Bey's glorious toy.

738
01:34:56,523 --> 01:35:02,373
We ate but we must say a few things...

739
01:35:02,805 --> 01:35:04,554
...or else it won't be good my Bey.

740
01:35:06,343 --> 01:35:08,788
We'll see what Bamsi will say.

741
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:12,717
EyvAllah my Bey.

742
01:35:13,209 --> 01:35:20,062
Now, deers know where the plants are,
goats know where the grasses are...

743
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,560
...camels know the traces..

744
01:35:23,976 --> 01:35:27,656
...foxes smell everything..

745
01:35:28,702 --> 01:35:32,304
...horses know which is heavy and which is light...

746
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,960
...suffering people know where it hurts...

747
01:35:37,491 --> 01:35:41,350
...the brain knows whet ignorance is....

748
01:35:42,428 --> 01:35:43,741
Now...

749
01:35:43,881 --> 01:35:49,256
Ozan (poet) takes his qopuz ad goes to Beys

750
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:51,237
-Eyvallah.

751
01:35:51,318 --> 01:35:56,045
Ozan knows which Bey is generous.

752
01:35:56,162 --> 01:36:00,108
May Ozans sing in your tent.

753
01:36:00,764 --> 01:36:04,123
May Allah prevent misfortunes.

754
01:36:05,631 --> 01:36:09,146
My Bey, may your state last!

755
01:36:09,413 --> 01:36:11,912
May it last my Bey!

756
01:36:14,022 --> 01:36:15,889
Amin brother amin.

757
01:36:17,139 --> 01:36:19,788
Bamsi said a few things...

758
01:36:21,201 --> 01:36:23,545
Now it's time for you to say a few things, Ozan.

759
01:36:23,772 --> 01:36:25,303
EyvAllah Ertugrul Bey.

760
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:30,498
Oghuz's 24 ancestors.
It's the victory day.

761
01:36:30,663 --> 01:36:34,271
Noble breed of glorious turks.
it's the victory day.

762
01:36:34,888 --> 01:36:38,373
Bozok and three arrowed ways.

763
01:36:38,677 --> 01:36:42,380
May the road of conquest open.
It's the victory day.

764
01:36:42,732 --> 01:36:46,146
We have traces in Malazgirt.
we have many martyrs.

765
01:36:46,227 --> 01:36:50,055
We have a thousand years past.
It's the victory day.

766
01:36:50,551 --> 01:36:54,505
Don't forget your ancestors who
built this state.

767
01:36:54,826 --> 01:36:58,373
Don't forget who fell martyr for you.
It's the victory day.

768
01:36:58,684 --> 01:37:01,701
The day will come soon and everyone
will learn it.

769
01:37:01,803 --> 01:37:05,248
Crusaders will be ruined soon.

770
01:37:05,692 --> 01:37:08,842
these lands are not enough for us!

771
01:37:08,966 --> 01:37:12,349
Sun will raise a lot more times!
It's the victory day.

772
01:37:12,848 --> 01:37:19,849
Know that blood is the same during war. Burn
with the love of war.
It's the victory day.

773
01:37:20,019 --> 01:37:28,123
Let's fly our flags. Let's shed
Yezid's blood. It's the victory day.

774
01:37:37,491 --> 01:37:39,677
take your swords and shields.

775
01:37:40,365 --> 01:37:44,045
We shouldn't be ashamed as
Bey's sons when we go to toy.

776
01:37:45,083 --> 01:37:47,067
We won't fight, brother...

777
01:38:00,973 --> 01:38:02,934
What are you doing?

778
01:38:08,824 --> 01:38:10,520
It's  my sword.

779
01:38:11,043 --> 01:38:12,926
It's a glorious sword, Osman.

780
01:38:13,222 --> 01:38:15,520
Let me wear it.
-No brother.

781
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:17,231
Wear your own sword brother.

782
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:21,403
I'm the oldest. I must wear it.

783
01:38:21,637 --> 01:38:23,286
You are both talented in swords.

784
01:38:23,387 --> 01:38:26,558
This is the first time for me.

785
01:38:26,855 --> 01:38:30,911
I prepared this sword with my father.
It's my right.

786
01:38:31,176 --> 01:38:35,489
So what? He is our father too.

787
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:42,332
I will put it in fire and let it melt.

788
01:38:51,145 --> 01:38:53,809
You won with you obstinacy Osman.

789
01:38:58,168 --> 01:39:01,895
What are you doing here?

790
01:39:02,137 --> 01:39:04,989
- The wedding will start son.
-We are ready grandmother.

791
01:39:09,488 --> 01:39:11,441
Your father will leave tomorrow.

792
01:39:12,074 --> 01:39:15,300
But you're Dundar uncle is on the way.

793
01:39:15,411 --> 01:39:17,161
Dundar uncle?

794
01:39:17,505 --> 01:39:19,161
Yes, Dundar uncle.

795
01:39:21,527 --> 01:39:23,379
He will come here after years

796
01:39:23,667 --> 01:39:26,559
this time he won't leave.

797
01:39:27,472 --> 01:39:31,207
He must be a Bey like you.

798
01:39:32,661 --> 01:39:35,450
We'll see what you will do with your Dündar uncle.

799
01:39:36,168 --> 01:39:37,762
Come, come.

800
01:41:03,352 --> 01:41:05,689
Umur's daughter Ilbilge...

801
01:41:06,898 --> 01:41:11,823
... do you accept Suleyman Sah's son Ertugrul as your husband?

802
01:41:12,189 --> 01:41:13,204
I do.

803
01:41:13,935 --> 01:41:15,268
Do you?

804
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:16,580
I do.

805
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:19,290
Do you?
- I do.

806
01:41:27,095 --> 01:41:33,650
Süleyman Sah's son Ertugrul, do you accept Umur's
daughter Ilbilge as your wife?

807
01:41:34,298 --> 01:41:35,353
I do.

808
01:41:36,845 --> 01:41:38,408
Do you?

809
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:39,759
I do.

810
01:41:40,166 --> 01:41:42,735
Do you?
- I do.

811
01:41:50,642 --> 01:41:54,626
Witnesses, do you witness?

812
01:41:54,798 --> 01:41:56,798
-We do.

813
01:41:57,191 --> 01:41:58,391
And I ...

814
01:41:58,697 --> 01:42:03,935
...in front of witnesses and people...

815
01:42:04,355 --> 01:42:07,381
...solemnise. May Allah make it last long.

816
01:42:07,725 --> 01:42:08,725
Amine.

817
01:42:08,787 --> 01:42:09,787
Amine.

818
01:43:20,187 --> 01:43:21,187
Father...

819
01:43:21,773 --> 01:43:26,036
you just came from the duty. Why are
you leaving tomorrow?

820
01:43:28,539 --> 01:43:29,928
Aslıhan.

821
01:43:30,922 --> 01:43:33,953
My beautiful daughter.

822
01:43:34,983 --> 01:43:39,078
Many wars are waiting for us.

823
01:43:39,750 --> 01:43:42,727
My dear, valiants' duty starts with the...

824
01:43:42,844 --> 01:43:46,281
...adhan when he was born...

825
01:43:46,726 --> 01:43:51,070
... and ends with the sela when he died.

826
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:56,234
Is it going to take time, father?

827
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:58,571
My Aybars...

828
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:00,781
son..

829
01:44:01,578 --> 01:44:02,754
....it might be a day...

830
01:44:04,343 --> 01:44:05,734
or a year.

831
01:44:06,607 --> 01:44:07,718
Son ...

832
01:44:08,969 --> 01:44:11,757
We might not come back.

833
01:44:25,028 --> 01:44:26,552
My children ...

834
01:44:27,012 --> 01:44:31,687
... we will take justice there.

835
01:44:31,768 --> 01:44:33,977
We will take hope to innocent people.

836
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:39,903
Children... nothing is for today.

837
01:44:40,287 --> 01:44:43,720
Everything  is for tomorrow.

838
01:44:44,708 --> 01:44:52,286
Everything is for to leave a good
future for children like you.

839
01:44:57,684 --> 01:44:58,828
My Bamsi...

840
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,075
... whether you come back or stay ...

841
01:45:02,329 --> 01:45:07,927
...you have a Hatun and children who will be proud
of you even if you go and not come back. Know that.

842
01:45:08,522 --> 01:45:12,435
We pray for you and valiants like you.

843
01:45:13,874 --> 01:45:16,364
EyvAllah my Hafsa. EyvAllah.

844
01:45:17,352 --> 01:45:20,958
Don't I know you ?

845
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:24,060
MasAllah.

846
01:45:28,559 --> 01:45:30,169
My dear...

847
01:45:30,591 --> 01:45:34,052
My Dear...

848
01:45:35,068 --> 01:45:37,591
My lion, my lion.

849
01:46:11,848 --> 01:46:12,848
Thank you.

850
01:46:24,509 --> 01:46:26,509
Why are you standing up Ilbilge Hatun?

851
01:46:28,337 --> 01:46:29,789
Are you obstaining from your Bey?

852
01:46:33,486 --> 01:46:34,586
Come.

853
01:46:49,223 --> 01:46:52,066
I thought Sogut was going to be
a dungeon for me...

854
01:46:52,999 --> 01:46:56,305
...every dark cloud that descended upon me.

855
01:46:57,184 --> 01:46:59,263
..are not here now.

856
01:47:01,231 --> 01:47:05,177
Thanks to the hope and brightness that
you gave, Ertugrul Bey.

857
01:47:07,341 --> 01:47:11,271
No matter how you've been,
you protected your tribe.

858
01:47:12,772 --> 01:47:14,873
And I believe that...

859
01:47:15,193 --> 01:47:18,451
... you will protect my tent aswell.

860
01:47:21,071 --> 01:47:24,037
We will brighten the darkness together now.

861
01:47:24,514 --> 01:47:27,247
..and pass the hard tests together.

862
01:47:31,875 --> 01:47:34,719
We will be separated now.

863
01:47:36,508 --> 01:47:38,442
the biggest award for me is not only being your Hatun...

864
01:47:39,151 --> 01:47:41,351
...but being with you on the...

865
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:46,660
..way to Hakk.

866
01:47:47,076 --> 01:47:49,788
This is my most important duty now.

867
01:47:56,874 --> 01:47:58,874
My family was destroyed.

868
01:48:00,726 --> 01:48:02,640
My tent was lonely.

869
01:48:04,468 --> 01:48:07,002
I was in the depth of hopelessness.

870
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:12,566
There was no light...

871
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:18,933
But Allah showed his mercy in His tests.

872
01:48:22,289 --> 01:48:26,070
He gave me a family
and a glorious tent.

873
01:48:29,635 --> 01:48:36,794
Humankind is tested with his fur,
beloved ones and position.

874
01:48:38,936 --> 01:48:41,646
You were tested with..

875
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:46,629
..all of them..

876
01:48:47,973 --> 01:48:51,746
..you never gave up on truth.

877
01:48:54,136 --> 01:48:57,488
Only an honest Hatun like you would..

878
01:48:57,691 --> 01:49:01,003
..fit into this tent after years.

879
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:54,770
It's time to set off, Ilbilge Hatun.

880
01:49:55,934 --> 01:50:01,278
Safely go, Ertugrul Bey.
Your tent and tribe is a deposit for us.

881
01:50:08,254 --> 01:50:12,106
Now i can turn my back as you're here, Ilbilge Hatun.

882
01:50:13,559 --> 01:50:16,682
I don't have to think about it.

883
01:50:23,885 --> 01:50:27,611
And i hope for the future, Ertugrul Bey.

884
01:50:29,417 --> 01:50:34,400
I believe that you will be told in legends.

885
01:50:34,526 --> 01:50:36,935
Your fights will be told.

886
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:42,447
And i know that your grand children will
remember you.

887
01:50:43,291 --> 01:50:48,472
Because people who will remember you
with a smile on their face after years..

888
01:50:48,745 --> 01:50:51,068
...are your accepted prayers.

889
01:50:52,043 --> 01:50:54,731
InsAllah. InsAllah.

890
01:51:07,459 --> 01:51:10,669
We try, Allah decides.

891
01:51:30,517 --> 01:51:33,864
I may not come back, mother.

892
01:51:36,857 --> 01:51:38,216
Give your blessings.

893
01:51:41,853 --> 01:51:43,387
they're yours, son.

894
01:51:47,355 --> 01:51:52,010
My child...

895
01:51:52,838 --> 01:51:57,734
..which i raised with my love .. my dear...

896
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:02,975
May your mother's prayers be wings to you.

897
01:52:04,093 --> 01:52:06,468
EyvAllah mother. EyvAllah.

898
01:52:16,888 --> 01:52:17,888
Father...

899
01:52:21,273 --> 01:52:23,709
Hey masAllah to my valiants.

900
01:52:26,766 --> 01:52:29,101
You are the sticks of our tent.

901
01:52:31,293 --> 01:52:36,168
You will stand tall. so our tent and heads will be up...

902
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:40,002
Osman...

903
01:52:40,557 --> 01:52:42,345
tent is entrusted to you.

904
01:52:50,596 --> 01:52:52,263
Come, my valiants.

905
01:53:12,708 --> 01:53:16,521
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

906
01:53:44,557 --> 01:53:49,150
We saw many cruels.

907
01:53:51,806 --> 01:53:55,874
We didn't give up and went everywhere that were
said to  be impossible.

908
01:53:58,010 --> 01:54:00,548
We went over mountains.

909
01:54:04,078 --> 01:54:07,312
Now there's a..

910
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:09,632
...new labour pain.

911
01:54:12,047 --> 01:54:16,539
It's not only the pain of a day which splits...

912
01:54:16,959 --> 01:54:18,882
...the dark and the day it's the pain of a new
order...

913
01:54:19,836 --> 01:54:22,084
... and a new period.

914
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:31,303
And the time we were waiting for has come.

915
01:54:31,905 --> 01:54:34,944
We tried for years.

916
01:54:36,332 --> 01:54:39,277
We may not come back.

917
01:54:40,147 --> 01:54:41,680
Give your blessings.

918
01:54:41,793 --> 01:54:47,020
All yours! All yours!

919
01:54:49,293 --> 01:54:53,392
We won't be one of those who left
this world...

920
01:54:54,942 --> 01:54:58,918
...who became tired and...

921
01:54:59,537 --> 01:55:00,537
..escaped.

922
01:55:03,783 --> 01:55:09,420
Now it's time to seal Anatolia with resurrection
who destiny was mixed with...

923
01:55:10,899 --> 01:55:13,166
...grief and sorrow.

924
01:55:15,595 --> 01:55:24,500
Allah-u Ekber!

925
01:56:20,309 --> 01:56:24,332
May the mountains be pastures to
you may hills be easy to pass for you..

926
01:56:24,629 --> 01:56:28,230
...may stones don't touch your feet..

927
01:56:29,262 --> 01:56:30,438
My son...

928
01:56:31,456 --> 01:56:34,222
Safely go, my Ertuğrul Bey.

929
01:57:17,633 --> 01:57:19,939

...it's my oath to make you cruels' fear
and innocent people's...

932
01:57:28,542 --> 01:57:31,532
..shelter.

933
01:58:10,156 --> 01:58:12,992
Ey our sword, which is the basis of our Beylic.

934
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:18,389
It's my oath to not put you in
your case...
until i destroy all of the villains.

935
01:58:35,171 --> 01:58:39,482
Ey my glorious flag....

936
01:58:40,224 --> 01:58:42,560
..it's my oath to carry you..

937
01:58:42,967 --> 01:58:45,464
..around the world and fly.

938
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:50,115
So that we will raise...

939
01:58:50,599 --> 01:58:52,957
...so that the world will wake up...

940
01:58:53,467 --> 01:58:57,005
... then we will be the bearers of those flags, insAllah.

941
02:00:15,253 --> 02:00:16,604
Come on valiants.

942
02:00:17,417 --> 02:00:19,456
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

943
02:00:29,988 --> 02:00:35,784
O, who put starts in the sky
and make the clouds mobe...

944
02:00:36,205 --> 02:00:39,650
..o, my Allah, who defeats the armies...

945
02:00:40,073 --> 02:00:44,573
...You hide lights behind the dark...

946
02:00:44,949 --> 02:00:50,154
...divided islam world
is waiting for a hope.

947
02:00:50,569 --> 02:00:52,917
Make us causes of this salvation.

948
02:00:53,333 --> 02:00:56,300
MAke us the flag bearers of this da'wah.

949
02:00:56,756 --> 02:01:02,599
Make us unite the islam world.

950

Make our horses strong.

951
02:01:07,550 --> 02:01:10,854
Maake our swords strong, which we raise for justice.

952
02:01:11,347 --> 02:01:13,489
May the sun which shines upon us...

953
02:01:13,606 --> 02:01:16,981
... be the informer of the light days.

954
02:01:17,661 --> 02:01:21,987
May it be the starter of a new day...

955
02:01:22,154 --> 02:01:24,687
...which will brighten years.

956
02:01:25,191 --> 02:01:27,464

They saw sun as their flag and sky as their tent.

959
02:01:37,455 --> 02:01:42,082
They rode their horses to endless lands.

960
02:01:42,588 --> 02:01:47,214
They saw their swords as their friends and
made thir armies brave.

961
02:01:47,983 --> 02:01:53,917
they carried the holy news to more lands.

962
02:01:54,230 --> 02:01:57,863
They became the name for Resurrection at a time...

963
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:00,542
...when there was no hope.

964
02:02:01,151 --> 02:02:04,565
And they shouted.

965
02:02:04,958 --> 02:02:10,690
"Justice forever!
Freedom forever!"

966
02:05:23,285 --> 02:05:27,418
