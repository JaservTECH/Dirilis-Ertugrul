00:01.000 --> 00:03.000
Episode 62 will start after 12:40 min.

12:13.877 --> 12:17.440
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY.

12:18.213 --> 12:20.789
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

12:57.560 --> 12:59.160
<i>With the 99 names</i>

12:59.480 --> 13:03.280
<i>of the omnipotent God</i>
<i>who fills our hearts with faith...</i>

13:03.760 --> 13:05.080
<i>Holy God!</i>

13:06.160 --> 13:07.120
<i>Dear God,</i>

13:07.480 --> 13:10.400
<i>demolish the traps</i>
<i>on our way of holy voyage.</i>

13:11.240 --> 13:13.920
<i>Keep us alert in the face of the enemy.</i>

13:15.120 --> 13:16.080
<i>Dear God,</i>

13:16.400 --> 13:18.520
<i>let our weapons be</i>
<i>as mighty as the Zulfiqar</i>

13:19.200 --> 13:21.600
<i>and our hearts be</i>
<i>as brave as Imam Ali's heart.</i>

13:22.600 --> 13:25.080
<i>Don't give the chance</i>
<i>to those who want to</i>

13:25.520 --> 13:28.280
<i>destroy our brotherhood, unity and peace.</i>

13:28.880 --> 13:30.800
<i>We ask for only thy help,</i>

13:31.160 --> 13:32.840
<i>we bow only to thou.</i>

13:33.360 --> 13:35.040
<i>Don't leave us alone, my God.</i>

13:55.160 --> 13:56.200
Praise be to God!

13:56.480 --> 13:58.040
Praise to God!

13:58.240 --> 13:59.200
Praise be to God!

13:59.320 --> 14:00.720
Praise to God!

14:00.800 --> 14:01.760
Praise be to God!

14:01.840 --> 14:03.000
Praise to God!

14:03.080 --> 14:04.160
Praise be to God!

14:04.240 --> 14:05.480
Praise to God!

14:35.120 --> 14:36.880
We've secured the perimeters, sir.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.400
Very well.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.920
Ertuğrul should be here any moment.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.080
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>

15:26.400 --> 15:27.360
<i>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

15:42.680 --> 15:44.600
Our sultan sends his regards to you.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.680
He is very pleased with your services.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.760
I heard the dog has become the new vizier.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.640
Sometimes dirty people are needed
for the dirty work.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.680
The state should be clean at all times.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.320
It should cleanse the source of the dirt

16:01.600 --> 16:03.640
in order to prevent us from drowning
in that dirt one day.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.760
No doubt our sultan has a plan.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.680
That's also what I hope.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.240
The sultan has a new task for you.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.320
I'd be honored.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.720
You...

16:24.200 --> 16:25.920
will conquer Karacahisar.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.800
It plays a key role.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.000
If we conquer Karacahisar

16:32.680 --> 16:36.400
then we can take all the Byzantium lands
to Constantinople.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.040
We've gotten rid of the traitors.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.400
Now is the time to conquer.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.600
With God's permission, we'll do our best.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.920
We will handle this
without alerting anyone.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.480
You...

16:58.800 --> 17:00.360
will look as weak as possible.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.280
No one will expect any danger

17:05.840 --> 17:08.080
neither financially nor militarily.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.720
We can handle looking like a tamed sheep.

17:14.680 --> 17:15.640
Nice.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.880
According to the intel from Constantinople

17:21.680 --> 17:24.480
Crusaders are getting prepared
for a new crusade.

17:25.320 --> 17:27.600
They intend to drive us away
from these lands.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.680
And we intend to
make these lands our home.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.840
This one is different, Sir Ertuğrul.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.800
All the enemies joined forces.

17:36.720 --> 17:40.040
Making preparations to attack us
with all the power they have.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.800
Then we Turks will defend our country
until the last drop of our blood.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.240
So...

17:50.880 --> 17:53.680
we will act quick
and barricade their attack.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.400
Appreciated.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.960
That's exactly what we want.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.000
Defense begins on the enemy territory.

18:02.560 --> 18:03.640
Otherwise...

18:04.800 --> 18:06.520
we might lose our homeland.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.240
Now...

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
listen carefully to what I have to say.

18:17.760 --> 18:21.960
The sultan's spy in Constantinople
will bring a name to you.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.920
This name belongs to...

18:26.240 --> 18:27.960
the spy of the Templars.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.560
The devil himself.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.520
His purpose...

18:34.200 --> 18:36.560
is to pave the way for the crusaders
in our lands.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.840
I know all too well about the sultan's spy
in Constantinople.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.120
We won't be able to conquer Karacahisar
until the Templar spy is dead.

18:49.440 --> 18:50.920
Where will I find him?

19:09.280 --> 19:11.200
Where?

19:12.360 --> 19:14.440
The inn...

19:16.560 --> 19:18.640
Bazaar...

19:37.480 --> 19:38.440
Dündar!

19:39.200 --> 19:40.200
Get that traitor!

21:48.680 --> 21:49.640
Turgut!

22:51.520 --> 22:52.480
What the hell?

22:52.800 --> 22:54.080
Your people attacked.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.880
Not ours, they were Iznik's Templars.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.480
Damn idiots.

23:09.400 --> 23:13.960
My sultan, the spy in Constantinople,
will come to the Bazaar at the inn.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.400
He will reveal
the name of the Templars' leader.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.480
To whom?

23:43.720 --> 23:44.920
Inglorious bastards.

24:03.520 --> 24:04.480
Brother...

24:05.920 --> 24:08.800
He told a man with a covered face
everything you discussed.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.760
Did he reveal our identities?

24:10.880 --> 24:12.880
Stopped talking
when my arrow went through his neck.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.280
Good lad!

24:16.720 --> 24:18.480
You have spared us from big trouble.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.560
We have two different enemies, sir.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.400
First one is those who can be seen,

24:25.560 --> 24:27.560
the other one is the unseen bastards.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
It's even better, my lad.
One goes, the other comes.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.520
We won't be out of options.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.800
Our war is on a different level now.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.840
We must be alert at all times here.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.320
They have created games within games.

24:43.600 --> 24:48.040
In order to destroy these traps,
we will do what they do.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.440
Sir, let us cut their tongues

24:51.680 --> 24:53.680
and deliver them
from their lies and traps.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.400
To achieve victory in this holy voyage

24:56.720 --> 25:00.080
we shall now design our own traps
for them.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.640
First, let's bury our martyrs

25:07.000 --> 25:09.200
then we will go for the bazaar
at the inn.

25:09.840 --> 25:10.800
Yes, sir.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.360
Yes, sir.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.760
"Don't descript those who die
in the pursuit of Allah's way as dead.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.720
On the contrary, they are alive.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.240
Yet, you cannot see them."

25:59.080 --> 26:01.040
{\an8}THE VILLAGE OF KAYI

26:15.240 --> 26:17.160
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

26:18.200 --> 26:22.600
May you have control
over your body and mind.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.920
Don't look for your daily bread anywhere

26:27.520 --> 26:28.640
but in God's presence.

26:30.520 --> 26:34.880
May you not waste your intelligence
and skills for anything but good.

26:41.760 --> 26:45.680
I give the hand.

26:46.040 --> 26:50.040
I have the end.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.960
May you not hurt a single creature.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.320
May you not have dirt on your hands.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.080
May you not lay eyes on evil.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.040
I'll do all I can to be the remedy,

27:13.400 --> 27:15.320
to be the cure

27:15.880 --> 27:20.240
and to be worthy of my mentor.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.760
Appreciate it, son.

27:27.960 --> 27:29.480
May God help you.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.720
Gündüz!

27:37.080 --> 27:38.440
Gündüz!

27:41.000 --> 27:41.960
<i>My brother!</i>

28:18.840 --> 28:20.480
Gündüz! My brother!

28:30.680 --> 28:31.680
Gündüz!

28:35.640 --> 28:38.240
Don't cry, my little lamb, what happened?

28:41.040 --> 28:43.240
My sweetie, don't cry.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.280
Don't cry.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.360
There's blood all over the child's face.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.400
You can't even take care
of a child, Günkut.

28:55.920 --> 28:58.120
Lady Halime, I swear to God
it's not my fault.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.280
My girl, boys grow up
having such experiences.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.800
It's their mothers' duty to straighten
and sharpen these experiences.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.880
If you keep hugging and coddling him

29:15.120 --> 29:16.640
anytime he gets hurt...

29:20.320 --> 29:23.120
then you'll raise a coward,
not a brave man.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.240
You're right, Mother.

29:32.840 --> 29:33.720
Thank you.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.040
My Gündüz will be brave just like his dad

29:37.480 --> 29:39.000
and his uncles.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.040
So İshak's first patient is my Gündüz.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.000
How is the inventory?

29:48.960 --> 29:51.040
I'll start allocation in a moment.

29:53.080 --> 29:56.240
But if Ertuğrul comes with an empty hand
then we'll have a hard time.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.400
You go deal with your tasks,
I will take care of Gündüz.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.360
-Sweetheart...
-Günkut, help her out.

30:08.120 --> 30:09.000
My sweet lamb...

31:08.400 --> 31:11.120
Women with children get in line for flour.

31:13.880 --> 31:17.480
The old and sick should get in that line
for buckwheat.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.720
Come on, hand over your pots.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.880
Next.

32:08.960 --> 32:12.360
Which of my children am I supposed to feed
with only this much flour, Lady Halime?

32:16.480 --> 32:19.280
Patience, sisters.
Just a little more patience.

32:19.600 --> 32:23.840
We've been patiently waiting for months,
still all we get is a pot of flour!

32:24.160 --> 32:26.560
The animals are wasted,
nothing to hunt on the mountains.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.440
We are starving, enough is enough.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.800
What are we supposed to eat?
Where are we supposed to find bread?

32:35.560 --> 32:36.680
Enough is enough.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.920
Is this what we get
for months of suffering?

32:54.160 --> 32:55.400
What did we do wrong?

32:56.760 --> 32:57.760
Enough is enough.

33:03.920 --> 33:08.600
Sir Ertuğrul didn't promise you
a garden of flowers without thorns.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.880
He said that the road would be tough.

33:13.680 --> 33:16.000
He said it'd be a tough ride
for all the travelers.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.640
What is it you are after now?

33:20.440 --> 33:21.680
Lady Halime!

33:25.200 --> 33:29.000
It is Sir Ertuğrul's road
that has put us in this situation.

33:29.960 --> 33:31.440
She is right.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.520
Humor me...

33:34.280 --> 33:36.720
who is the one
that left the tribe to starve?

33:37.680 --> 33:39.400
Come on, who is the one?

33:39.480 --> 33:43.600
Alp Doğan gave his life for Ertuğrul
without hesitation...

33:44.840 --> 33:47.040
and now here you are talking like this.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.880
Know your place, Banu Cicek.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.000
That's all we have
in the inventory for now.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.080
Don't spice things up
so we can eat in peace.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.320
The reluctant ones can leave.

34:08.640 --> 34:10.640
Allah.

34:20.240 --> 34:21.600
Where are we supposed to go?

34:26.680 --> 34:29.680
{\an8}THE MARKETPLACE

35:44.520 --> 35:46.640
Troubled apostles of Jesus!

35:47.840 --> 35:50.800
Wise exiled-traders of Moses!

35:51.440 --> 35:53.760
Muhammed's first warriors!

35:54.280 --> 35:57.640
The bazaar of Simon is at your service

35:58.400 --> 36:01.200
in order to strengthen you,
fill your pockets with gold

36:02.800 --> 36:07.960
and to rain prosperity over you.

36:08.720 --> 36:11.600
How will you identify sultan's spy
in this crowd, brother?

36:12.560 --> 36:14.560
If your eyes don't recognize
those on your side...

36:15.360 --> 36:17.640
and your heart doesn't know
those who walk with you...

36:18.280 --> 36:20.560
then you have already lost the war.

36:21.400 --> 36:25.280
Sir, let's see who will taste
the rage of our swords here.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.040
Brother...

36:27.360 --> 36:31.200
if you stand still, then it'll be better
for our pockets instead of our swords.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.480
So be it.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.720
Simon, the owner of the bazaar at the inn,

36:38.240 --> 36:41.440
where silk meets with cashmere,

36:41.840 --> 36:45.200
food is fumigated with spices,

36:45.520 --> 36:48.240
households fancied with fabric

36:48.680 --> 36:52.400
awaits you.

36:53.640 --> 36:54.680
Come!

36:56.440 --> 36:57.280
Come!

36:58.320 --> 36:59.400
Come!

37:01.520 --> 37:02.920
Follow me!

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Well, brother,

37:04.640 --> 37:08.680
the voice of that dwarf
is almost equal to that of a bear's.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.840
How come he is able to have such a voice?

37:12.000 --> 37:14.280
I wish we found
some of that in the bazaar.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.160
The one thought of setting up this bazaar

37:19.680 --> 37:20.720
should be feared, brother.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.240
Come on.

37:24.080 --> 37:30.280
How come the idiots in Constantinople
can't hide my identity from the spy!

37:40.040 --> 37:43.400
But they don't know
you are a Templar, Sir Simon.

37:44.920 --> 37:48.000
But they do know we serve the Pope
and the crusaders.

37:49.680 --> 37:53.120
The fault is absolutely
with the Grand Master Benedictus.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.320
They will pay for that.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.720
I will make them pay for that.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.760
I will take this issue

38:00.840 --> 38:03.560
to the high council of Templars,
as soon as possible.

38:05.640 --> 38:08.720
Don't they know
what their stupidity will cost us?

38:09.320 --> 38:12.760
What if our presence from Iznik to Konya
suffers a downfall?

38:12.880 --> 38:15.920
What if Sultan Aladdin's army reach there
before the Crusaders

38:16.000 --> 38:17.560
and conquer those lands?

38:20.360 --> 38:21.560
Damn it!

38:22.800 --> 38:24.400
We couldn't even identify him.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.440
What are we going to do, Sir Simon?

38:36.920 --> 38:40.880
We can figure out everything
if we catch the guy from Constantinople.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.360
The bazaar opens today.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.760
There will be thousands of men.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.440
How will I identify him?

38:49.240 --> 38:53.240
Coming from Constantinople,
Sultan's spy can't be an ordinary man.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.560
He will disguise himself
with a trusted profile.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.280
The best he can do is a knight.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.880
Your wit is frightening, Sir Simon.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.520
Set a trap on the way to the inn.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.680
Have the first knight you see
in your claws.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.200
How old is he?

41:00.280 --> 41:01.600
We have survived a long winter,

41:02.840 --> 41:06.200
and a summer with a temperature of hell.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.320
Our pockets are hungry for gold.

41:10.200 --> 41:13.400
Both my bazaar and inn
will be at your service

41:13.680 --> 41:17.000
until the winds of winter cut our faces.

41:21.760 --> 41:26.480
Of course, only if you have goods to sell
or have gold to purchase goods.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.200
You will find the most precious goods
from Constantinople

41:33.800 --> 41:38.800
to China, on the stands of this bazaar.

41:39.320 --> 41:42.160
If you are the owner,
then I will be responsible

41:42.880 --> 41:46.000
for the safety of your stands
and the goods on your stands.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.400
Right.

41:48.560 --> 41:51.560
Some of you already know,
if not let it be known.

41:52.320 --> 41:54.760
This bazaar belongs to Simon!

41:56.600 --> 42:00.120
May all your pockets be filled with gold.

42:01.000 --> 42:05.600
Sir Simon, Johannes Batakis
is the emperor of the Byzantine

42:05.840 --> 42:07.880
and you are the emperor of this bazaar.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.560
Long live Simon!

42:10.760 --> 42:12.760
Long live Simon!

42:32.600 --> 42:35.880
My sister, Maria, has made
a grand preparation for you.

42:37.280 --> 42:40.040
Let everyone feast on it.

42:40.160 --> 42:45.520
Long live Simon!

42:47.120 --> 42:48.880
Sir Ertuğrul of the Kayi Tribe...

42:49.920 --> 42:51.760
so you visit bazaars, huh?

42:53.240 --> 42:55.120
Sir Ural from the Cavdar Tatars.

42:56.320 --> 43:00.080
I heard that
the bazaars long to see brave men.

43:00.680 --> 43:01.880
So here we are.

43:05.280 --> 43:09.600
Did you come all the way
just to sell those animal skins?

43:13.120 --> 43:14.280
Let alone myself...

43:14.760 --> 43:16.520
not to anyone in this bazaar...

43:19.920 --> 43:21.840
Just get to know your world, Sir Ertuğrul.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.240
Get to know this world.

43:23.840 --> 43:27.640
Look, people bring a ton of goods
all the way

43:28.040 --> 43:29.800
from China, Venice, India.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.360
You?

43:31.520 --> 43:35.360
Bringing a couple of carcass skins
to a bazaar that is under your nose.

43:41.720 --> 43:42.680
Look at that man.

43:45.120 --> 43:49.440
He makes a fortune every single day,
the likes of which you will never see.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.240
Do you know why?

43:53.320 --> 43:56.320
He puts his mind to work
instead of his sword, that's why.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.440
Be careful though.

44:02.480 --> 44:04.280
You wouldn't even know how
to buy and sell goods.

44:05.760 --> 44:06.720
Huh?

44:07.760 --> 44:09.360
Don't sell those skins for nothing.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.640
Don't go back to the tribe
with empty hands.

44:13.480 --> 44:14.480
Sir Ural...

44:17.160 --> 44:18.920
I got to know many people

44:19.480 --> 44:22.520
who want to give away all their gold
while suffering under my sword.

44:22.960 --> 44:23.920
Yet...

44:24.800 --> 44:25.760
I haven't met a brave man

44:26.280 --> 44:28.600
who would give away his sword
in return of gold.

44:30.800 --> 44:32.840
You are a smart fellow, Sir Ertuğrul.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.200
Look, these men here today

44:36.760 --> 44:39.280
are not chasing after swords or battles.

44:40.600 --> 44:41.560
And you?

44:42.360 --> 44:43.560
You are chasing gold.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.480
Farewell.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.040
Don't forget what I have said.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.240
Be careful.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.720
First wines are on me.

44:56.800 --> 44:59.320
Long live Simon!

45:09.800 --> 45:12.080
Long live Simon!

45:33.360 --> 45:34.320
Relax.

45:34.760 --> 45:35.840
This is not our guy.

46:04.760 --> 46:06.800
Here comes the degenerate. Be ready.

46:07.520 --> 46:09.040
But, sir, he is a knight.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.800
Not a knight.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.400
He is the spy we're looking for.

47:44.120 --> 47:46.720
Tie his hands and mouth tight.

47:46.880 --> 47:48.560
We need this degenerate alive.

48:07.760 --> 48:08.720
Brother...

48:09.720 --> 48:11.000
this seems like a nice place.

48:13.240 --> 48:14.920
We can sell the skins here.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.800
Let's set the stand here.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.080
Yes, sir.

48:21.840 --> 48:24.160
I wish Doğan was here.

48:24.320 --> 48:26.560
We could have him do the chores.

48:27.520 --> 48:28.600
Here I go.

48:35.320 --> 48:36.600
I will have a look around.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.320
Safeguard the stand.

48:40.680 --> 48:41.960
-Turgut.
-Yes, sir.

48:42.120 --> 48:44.480
You go visit the tradesmen
who sells wheat.

48:44.560 --> 48:45.600
Yes, sir.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.960
Sir Simon, I'm just curious,
what do you do with all the gold?

49:18.280 --> 49:19.840
Curiosity is a good thing, Sir Ural.

49:21.440 --> 49:26.320
As far as I heard, Sir Toktamış is
also curious about your business.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.040
Asking everyone about you.

49:29.760 --> 49:30.880
Accursed bastard.

49:31.480 --> 49:32.520
Looking for his doom.

49:39.400 --> 49:41.960
You can take care of him
when the time is right.

49:48.760 --> 49:50.400
I also have good news for you.

49:51.160 --> 49:53.840
Sultan Aladdin's man,
what was his name...

49:54.160 --> 49:55.280
Sadettin Kobek.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.520
Yes, that one.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.880
I learned this from a tradesman of Konya,

50:00.480 --> 50:02.560
Sadettin has become vizier to the sultan.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.120
So...

50:05.800 --> 50:07.600
that means I have the backup now.

50:08.840 --> 50:12.040
The goods coming from Konya
will be your responsibility now.

50:13.160 --> 50:14.560
You will earn nicely.

50:16.280 --> 50:17.760
If you don't do anything wrong...

50:18.560 --> 50:19.760
you will earn, too.

50:20.720 --> 50:22.360
But if you do...

50:34.680 --> 50:36.280
The man who has great confidence.

50:36.800 --> 50:37.760
Who is he?

50:38.040 --> 50:39.600
I saw him talking to you.

50:41.400 --> 50:43.040
Ertuğrul, son of Süleyman Shah.

50:44.240 --> 50:45.560
Very skilled on the battlefield.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.960
Here to sell a couple of carcass skins.

50:57.880 --> 51:00.920
But it feels like
his eyes are looking for something else.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.040
<i>Help me God.</i>

51:31.600 --> 51:34.280
<i>Let me see the man sent by the sultan.</i>

53:18.040 --> 53:19.800
Spices here, spices here!

53:40.480 --> 53:43.600
Wait. Drowning is too good for you.

53:43.880 --> 53:45.560
We're not done with you.

53:56.320 --> 53:58.880
Speaking would be good for you, son.

53:59.840 --> 54:00.800
Just so you know.

54:01.520 --> 54:04.960
Like a blade on this stone,
you're sharpening my anger.

54:05.960 --> 54:08.640
It's a pity.

54:09.960 --> 54:12.760
If you die, you'll fill your own grave.

54:13.280 --> 54:16.360
I'll be sad for your mourning mother.

54:16.840 --> 54:18.800
So tell me, go on.

54:19.040 --> 54:21.520
Did you destroy our goods?

54:22.760 --> 54:23.960
I've done nothing wrong.

54:24.640 --> 54:25.760
I'm innocent.

54:26.280 --> 54:30.920
My fist won't let go until you
start talking, you disgraceful scum,

54:32.000 --> 54:36.120
I'll show you what happens
when you touch Candar Bey's merchandise.

54:42.960 --> 54:43.960
I'll show you.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.080
Start talking.

55:10.520 --> 55:11.400
Aslıhan.

55:23.600 --> 55:28.040
If the men of the Tatar villages were
as brave as you are,

55:29.640 --> 55:32.560
the wrath of the enemy
would be a blessing to us.

55:36.360 --> 55:37.320
Kutluca.

55:43.320 --> 55:48.720
I left you to Aslıhan's merciful hands,
but...

55:49.320 --> 55:50.280
nothing.

55:51.160 --> 55:55.800
Let's see if my kindness
can get you talking.

56:00.240 --> 56:04.840
Apparently you don't hear so well,
since you didn't...

56:05.760 --> 56:08.440
answer my daughter Aslıhan.

56:08.920 --> 56:10.600
Why is there an ear here...

56:11.280 --> 56:13.400
if it doesn't hear anything?

56:23.640 --> 56:24.760
Let's see...

56:25.440 --> 56:27.680
if this ear hears better.

56:28.920 --> 56:32.400
Tell me, son,
how did our goods come to you?

56:32.720 --> 56:34.200
Who did you work with?

56:35.400 --> 56:36.360
Ural Bey.

56:36.680 --> 56:37.760
What did you say?

56:38.040 --> 56:39.880
-What?
-Your son, Ural Bey.

56:40.040 --> 56:42.160
He planned everything, I'm innocent.

56:52.240 --> 56:53.560
Bey... don't do it.

56:54.080 --> 56:56.680
If he dies, he can't face Ural Bey.

57:08.360 --> 57:11.720
Kutluca, go and tell Ural Bey to come here
at once.

57:11.800 --> 57:13.440
-As you command.
-Right now.

57:17.480 --> 57:18.440
Toktamış,

57:19.320 --> 57:20.280
Aslıhan...

57:21.160 --> 57:22.880
The dark sky...

57:23.760 --> 57:25.240
the desolate soil...

57:25.560 --> 57:27.360
the unfortunate birds...

57:28.120 --> 57:30.680
or any son of Adam...

57:31.040 --> 57:33.240
None will hear of this.

57:34.360 --> 57:35.320
Understood?

57:36.280 --> 57:38.440
-Understood.
-As you command, my Bey.

57:50.080 --> 57:52.360
Ural!

58:09.800 --> 58:11.360
Ural Bey's stew is ready.

58:12.280 --> 58:13.240
Who will take it?

58:15.680 --> 58:16.640
I will.

58:27.640 --> 58:29.200
I love you, Maria.

58:29.320 --> 58:31.600
My heart aches for your love. Tell me yes.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.800
So that I can ask for your hand.

58:41.880 --> 58:44.160
Your head is too heavy for you, Petro.

58:52.040 --> 58:53.800
Go find another dump.

58:58.320 --> 59:00.080
This is your share for now, Ural.

59:11.040 --> 59:13.520
I cooked you a stew myself, Ural Bey.

59:15.720 --> 59:17.080
Appreciate it, Ural Bey.

59:17.560 --> 59:19.600
Maria doesn't serve everybody.

59:21.800 --> 59:23.080
I'm grateful, Maria.

59:24.840 --> 59:26.160
Thank you.

59:26.560 --> 59:27.960
Enjoy it, my Bey.

59:36.960 --> 59:39.240
As you well know, Simon,

59:40.000 --> 59:42.880
power is everything in this land.

59:43.720 --> 59:45.560
And gold is its enforcer.

59:46.840 --> 59:47.800
But...

59:48.520 --> 59:52.120
the gold from a couple of caravans
doesn't do anything.

59:53.080 --> 59:56.000
I want to compete with the giants.

59:56.840 --> 59:58.160
It's time.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.320
Did you say this to your father
Candar Bey as well?

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.840
Don't involve my father, Simon.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.520
Wanting to compete with them...

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.560
I understand.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.360
However...

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.080
this is easier said than done.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.880
How will you do it, when you can't even
make your father listen?

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.960
You will see.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.040
Very soon.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.800
Ural Bey, Candar Bey and Toktamış Bey
await you at the shop.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.000
Come quickly.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.040
What for, Kutluca?

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.480
You will see soon, my Bey.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.160
I told you Toktamış was trouble.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.320
Toktamış...

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.360
If he's like you said,

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.440
Toktamış shall...

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.440
die by my hand.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.480
Just make a decision.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.240
I'll take care of the rest.

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.880
But be careful

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.920
that you don't die by your father's hand.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.560
I made a deal with the Reaper, Simon.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.760
He won't visit me until

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.120
I have my vengeance.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.200
Do what's necessary.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.680
Let my village...

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.240
taste death.

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.920
It's time, Maria.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.560
Prepare the sweet syrup
of the black widow.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.160
The prey is trapped, Master Simon.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.400
The scum was disguised as a knight,
just as you guessed.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.760
I took him down.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.360
Batuhan.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.560
Let's be ready for anything.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.240
We might never leave this shop.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.320
If something happens to me,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.080
take Çolpan Hatun away from the village.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.480
Don't worry, my Bey.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.680
Go away, Batuhan.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.800
Your eyes are like glass, Aslıhan.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.040
Only a blind man would not see
what's inside.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.040
What's going on?

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.520
My glass eyes have seen betrayal, brother.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.720
Then...

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.640
let them see justice as well.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.520
Let them see it

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.400
so those beautiful eyes can
give hope to your brother.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.320
Thankfully your mother is dead...

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.400
so she can't see this.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.400
Father, what is this?

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.160
What do you want from her?

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.080
When I look at you

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.480
I see her beautiful face.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.960
Thankfully she died young.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.600
I am thankful because

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.200
she didn't see your betrayal!

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:21.800
Father...

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.000
Don't mention my mother.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.760
Tell me who is slandering my name.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.560
That dog lying there?

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.000
What did he say?

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.440
My gold wasn't enough,

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.920
so you went after the gold of the village?

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.320
I haven't stolen from you or the village.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.960
You know the rules of trading
better than I do.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.120
Ever since you made me responsible
for the trade of the village

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.960
I've worked day and night

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.880
to fill your tent with gold.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.200
This is all I know.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.320
The rest is up to you.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.120
Apparently...

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.720
this dog managed to convince
you before dying.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:07.680
And my punishment is decided.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.840
Believe what you believe.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.480
You...

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.920
tell me the punishment, father.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.880
Even if you lost a river's worth of blood

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.280
it wouldn't clean your sins, Ural.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.080
I know everything.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:28.680
This dog told me everything before dying.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.520
How dare you even speak, you scum!

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.360
If this dog matters more than I do,

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.080
hear my last words.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.760
Whoever spreads

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.800
these lies about me

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.760
wants to come between father and son.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.880
Take my blood, father.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.200
May you never know peace.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.720
The rest is for you to take, father.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.720
Oh, servant of Jesus almighty
and my dear companion.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.080
I need your strength.

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.000
Give me your poison
in the name of the Holy Spirit.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.360
So that every drop of it can be a cure.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.120
Let our enemies drown.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.640
Let them all be damned.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:09.520
The shadow of Satan is between
your teeth, my little friend Sylvanus.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.720
What do you say?

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.560
Should we add some flavor to the food?

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.440
My Bey...

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.040
They even charge us for opening a booth.

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.920
As if it belongs to them.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:24.360
Who pays to put stuff on the ground, Bey?

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.640
We'll have our own booth one day,
Bamsi.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:28.920
Don't worry.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.080
Now, let's find a trader
and sell our goods.

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.800
Still no news, brother?

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.200
No doubt we'll meet the one coming from
Constantinople, Dündar.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.640
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.800
Is Candar Bey here?

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.680
Business not going well, Ertuğrul Bey?

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.280
And you've been in a fight, Ural Bey.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.560
You said not to fight here.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.160
Also, you've been wounded
for not keeping an eye out.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.160
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.280
-<i>Alaikum salaam, </i>brother.
-<i>Alaikum salaam.</i>

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.840
<i>Alaikum salaam.</i>

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.040
What's going on?

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.360
What are these furs?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.680
Furs, and anything else you want.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.320
Bear, bull, snake, fox, rabbit...

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.880
Anything you want.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.600
<i>Mashallah, mashallah.</i>

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:08.800
How much?

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.120
What will you pay?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.240
One gold coin per hide.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.120
Hey, trader.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.320
Ever been to a hunt?

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.520
No.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.400
Obviously, since you pay so low.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.840
Hunters brave many dangers to hunt these.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.000
What's happening, Aslıhan?

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:42.440
Are you his partner?

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.920
I respect the work behind them.

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.960
If you lower the price,
they are worth nothing.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.760
What a woman.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:00.600
Her husband is lucky.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.880
Sir, I will have to treat these goods.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.840
I lose money and time in treating them.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:11.920
So...

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.880
At most, you'll spend one coin per hide.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.320
Two more coins to treat it.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.680
Then you'll sell it for ten.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.400
What do you say?

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.560
Is that not enough profit for you?

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.960
Alright, tell me your price.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.560
Four gold coins per hide.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.120
Four gold coins?

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:46.880
No way.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.440
Do you want me to go bankrupt?

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.520
Four coins.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.480
And one for treating, five coins.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.920
And when you sell it for ten,
you'll be glad.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.120
Don't waste time.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.440
They have a long journey ahead.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.240
Oh, God.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.480
It's fate.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.440
If I didn't need them,
this wouldn't happen.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.880
Just so you know.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.400
Take them down.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.920
Right away.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:35.960
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.480
I wish we'd met you earlier,

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.480
so we could've saved time.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:09.640
Thank you.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.800
My Bey.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.400
These traders are tough.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.440
You know how to break them down.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.720
Thanks.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.000
I've heard that Kayı women are talented.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.920
Bring their carpets here, my Bey.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.600
You'll make a bigger profit.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.280
The drought was extremely hard on us
for years, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:50.320
We couldn't make anything.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.200
The Venetians will be here soon.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.240
They love the products
of the Turkmen villages.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.960
Our carpets are everywhere
in the Venetian and Genoese palaces.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.680
Just so you know.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:11.040
Sell them something, no matter what.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.400
When will they come?

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.720
Very soon, my Bey.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.520
Today or tomorrow.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.120
I'll won't forget this favor
you've done me.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.320
Thank you.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.280
Don't be fooled by their aged appearance.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.560
They're very talented.

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.840
They can do anything.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.280
One of them was a palace servant.

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:47.000
You scum.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.720
He's also a...

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.840
cook.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And this Armenian

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.560
is a mason.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.480
Not for 30,

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.480
not for 20,

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.160
not for ten,

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.400
you can have these slaves for only
five gold coins.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:12.000
Who will pay five gold coins for
these precious slaves?

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.640
Ural Bey?

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:18.080
If you wish, you can have
these slaves for five coins.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.320
Untie that old man.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.840
Run!

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.800
If you can outrun my arrow,

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.240
you're free.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:53.880
Run!

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.560
He told you to run, he's your new master!

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.200
Run.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:08.080
Run!

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.200
Run, save yourself!

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.120
If you can't run, you die.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:25.040
Run, run! Go!

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.640
Untie the other.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.000
Brother Ural.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.280
What are you doing?

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:00.880
That's enough.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.840
I told you to run.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:15.000
Run. Run for your life!

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.440
Don't. Don't do this, brother.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.880
-Run.
-Run away.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.400
-Run!
-Brother, don't!

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.960
Run! Run!

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.040
Step aside, Aslıhan.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:45.960
Step aside!

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.400
Run! Run!

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.640
Run! Run!

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.200
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:10.960
How much for you?

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:14.080
Five coins.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:15.880
Come with me.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.160
My Bey!

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.240
That man will kill me.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.000
Nobody can touch you while I'm here.

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:23.920
Come along.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.520
Ertuğrul...

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.280
Dündar.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.400
Give five coins to the slaver
for this man.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:48.640
That slave is mine, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.680
I already bought him.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.600
Then sell him to me.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.480
How much for that slave?

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:18.840
This letter is fake.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.520
Anything else on him?

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.240
No, Master Simon.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.000
Only this letter.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.360
So, you want to play.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.040
Then let's play.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:23:59.760
Speak, scum.

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:01.160
Where's your tongue?

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.840
What else could be expected from a spy
disguised as a knight?

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.360
Of course, you're a mute!

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.720
Give him to Tristan.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.560
Let him hang.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.920
If we can't understand you,

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.840
we'll find someone who we can.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:31.160
The Turks won't leave their dead.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.160
Whoever he works for
will come to take him.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.320
Master Simon.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.080
Trouble at the bazaar.

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.360
You should come.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.960
How much for that slave?

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.960
Apparently you sold your hides.

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.440
I asked you how much, Ural Bey.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.880
Since we're doing this in a market,

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.120
it's fair that I should
barter for a profit.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:20.880
Ten coins.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:22.960
Dündar.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.480
Give ten coins to Ural Bey.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.240
-My Bey, what are you doing?
-Dündar.

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.640
Brother, that's enough.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.240
Calm down.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:29.480
Ten coins for an old slave.

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.080
I want to dine with this good man.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.160
I hope you won't refuse the invitation of

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.400
the sole owner of the bazaar,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.640
I'll be there with my Alps, Master Simon.

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.680
Pleased to hear that, Ertuğrul Bey. Come.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.080
Sit here, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.000
What do the brave Alps desire?

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.160
Water.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:18.640
Only water?

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:24.200
If Master Simon hears that
I only offered water to his guests...

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.040
he'll be angry.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.600
We only want water.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.520
May you have a long life, brave men.

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.360
Thank you.

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:51.400
Maria.

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.240
Set the table.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.600
Bring us the drinks first.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:08.320
That woman can't take her eyes off you,
Turgut Er.

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:10.040
I know, brother.

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.320
Mesmerized when you said "water".

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:14.760
Hamza

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.360
Okay, Turgut Alp Baş, no more talking.

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:26.880
Simon's bazaar has been here for years.

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:28.720
However...

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:34.200
this is the first time he's seen a man
giving away gold for the life of a slave.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.960
And I have been traveling for years.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
It's the first time I've seen
someone murdered for fun.

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:23.520
Your fellow Muslim...

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.680
Ural hasn't learned mercy.

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.160
If you hadn't intervened,
my men would have stopped him.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.560
The issue isn't his cruelty,

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:42.200
but the organization of your bazaar,
Master Simon.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:45.400
It's built to oppress the poor.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.000
As a trader,
generosity is a trait I admire.

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:54.960
I'd like to see you more in the bazaar.

01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.560
We Turks, we like to
give hope to the poor.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:04.120
I'll be visiting your bazaar.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:07.640
Now...

01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:09.800
I should go.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.240
As you wish.

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.080
Brother.

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:36.360
It seems a man has emerged from
the Turkish villages

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:39.760
that you can't buy with gold.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:47.360
I've sent all their heroes to hell so far.

01:33:14.708 --> 01:33:16.708
Hey, folks!

01:33:17.548 --> 01:33:18.948
Come here.

01:33:20.068 --> 01:33:21.628
Gather!

01:33:23.028 --> 01:33:24.868
I said, gather!

01:33:26.588 --> 01:33:29.508
Gather and watch what I'm about to do.

01:33:32.468 --> 01:33:34.228
Come and see!

01:33:42.948 --> 01:33:43.908
What is it, brother?

01:33:46.828 --> 01:33:48.028
Do you know this man?

01:33:49.668 --> 01:33:50.988
He is our man.

01:33:56.148 --> 01:33:58.188
Why wait then? Let's go and rescue him.

01:33:59.188 --> 01:34:00.708
Folks!

01:34:01.228 --> 01:34:03.748
I'm hanging this thief
for stealing my goods,

01:34:04.268 --> 01:34:07.748
to make an example for other thieves.

01:34:09.708 --> 01:34:11.068
Know that...

01:34:11.828 --> 01:34:15.308
no one can steal
from Tristan the merchant.

01:34:16.508 --> 01:34:18.668
Now I'll enjoy his death.

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:21.948
Any objections?

01:34:30.348 --> 01:34:32.348
Any objections?

01:34:38.908 --> 01:34:43.028
Hang him!

01:34:45.548 --> 01:34:47.988
They know he won't talk.

01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:49.828
They're using him as bait.

01:34:50.708 --> 01:34:53.748
They want me to stand up for him.

01:35:00.588 --> 01:35:01.588
What now, brother?

01:35:03.508 --> 01:35:05.308
Night is the shelter of believers.

01:35:06.148 --> 01:35:07.708
We'll save him tonight.

01:35:08.268 --> 01:35:11.188
Hang him!

01:35:14.268 --> 01:35:17.108
Hang him!

01:35:18.708 --> 01:35:20.188
Hang him! Punish him!

01:35:20.268 --> 01:35:21.388
Shame.

01:35:28.388 --> 01:35:31.628
Kill him!

01:35:35.108 --> 01:35:36.028
No mercy!

01:35:36.508 --> 01:35:37.468
Hang him!

01:35:44.908 --> 01:35:45.868
Kill him!

01:36:04.028 --> 01:36:07.348
Seems like
Ertugrul is still under our feet.

01:36:12.308 --> 01:36:14.668
Though your feet are almost gone.

01:36:15.668 --> 01:36:17.108
Anyone under my feet

01:36:17.668 --> 01:36:19.588
will be six feet under, Master Simon.

01:36:22.548 --> 01:36:25.668
There is no other option.

01:36:27.268 --> 01:36:30.028
Then it is time to prove it.

01:36:36.268 --> 01:36:38.068
My father used to say,

01:36:38.148 --> 01:36:41.628
"Since Adam and Eve, no one knows
a sweeter poison than apple."

01:36:44.428 --> 01:36:45.628
May he rest in peace.

01:36:46.708 --> 01:36:47.908
I always believed that.

01:36:49.708 --> 01:36:52.388
Until I found
the shadow of the black widow.

01:36:53.308 --> 01:36:55.028
May the shadow of the black widow

01:36:55.868 --> 01:36:57.548
bless our people.

01:36:57.868 --> 01:37:02.228
Now, let's sweep away all the obstacles

01:37:03.308 --> 01:37:05.188
and promote trust in us.

01:37:06.428 --> 01:37:09.548
And tonight, as a starter,

01:37:09.748 --> 01:37:13.468
the clean and pitiful death of Toktamis

01:37:14.588 --> 01:37:16.268
will lead us in the right direction.

01:37:23.988 --> 01:37:26.548
The Venetian merchant is arriving soon.

01:37:27.588 --> 01:37:29.828
-Are the goods ready?
-Ready, yes.

01:37:30.388 --> 01:37:34.788
Never mind the goods, tell me
if the Venetians' sacks of gold are ready.

01:37:37.988 --> 01:37:41.108
I don't understand
why you're hiding it all from your father.

01:37:42.668 --> 01:37:45.468
With no secrecy, would it be exciting?

01:37:46.308 --> 01:37:50.028
And stop prying into everything,
Master Simon.

01:38:02.228 --> 01:38:03.188
Bey.

01:38:04.108 --> 01:38:05.468
When will Dogan arrive?

01:38:11.948 --> 01:38:13.668
When his duty is over, Turgut.

01:38:20.028 --> 01:38:20.988
Hacaturyan.

01:38:22.028 --> 01:38:22.868
Yes, Bey.

01:38:27.068 --> 01:38:28.068
I set you free.

01:38:30.188 --> 01:38:31.668
Go wherever you want.

01:38:45.868 --> 01:38:47.828
Bey!

01:38:51.628 --> 01:38:53.188
Bey, I owe you.

01:38:55.588 --> 01:38:57.988
I'll feel humiliated
if I leave without paying my debt.

01:38:59.908 --> 01:39:03.748
Well, I have no place to go
and a penny in my pocket.

01:39:05.508 --> 01:39:07.748
Bey, if you let me,

01:39:08.148 --> 01:39:10.748
I'll come with you and serve you.

01:39:12.348 --> 01:39:14.308
Besides, I'm still your slave.

01:39:15.548 --> 01:39:17.828
Maybe this old fellow

01:39:18.508 --> 01:39:20.868
can find a way to show his gratitude?

01:39:23.548 --> 01:39:24.908
Your loyalty

01:39:25.388 --> 01:39:27.388
and your blessing
would be more than enough.

01:39:30.228 --> 01:39:32.348
From now on, stay as you wish,
you're my guest.

01:39:36.268 --> 01:39:37.988
Stay as long as you want.

01:39:39.188 --> 01:39:41.228
God bless you, Bey.

01:40:32.708 --> 01:40:33.668
Girl.

01:40:35.388 --> 01:40:38.148
You're tired, get some rest.

01:40:46.828 --> 01:40:48.628
I can't sleep, mother.

01:40:51.188 --> 01:40:54.308
I know Ertugrul Bey
will bring us to light from this darkness,

01:40:56.428 --> 01:40:57.428
but the men...

01:41:00.548 --> 01:41:02.228
they just gave in.

01:41:03.748 --> 01:41:07.468
If anyone gets worn out
and decides to leave, then we're doomed.

01:41:09.428 --> 01:41:11.508
<i>May I, Halime Sultan?</i>

01:41:12.308 --> 01:41:13.348
Come in, Banu Cicek.

01:41:23.148 --> 01:41:24.188
You called for me.

01:41:25.828 --> 01:41:26.788
Tell me.

01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:35.988
Dogan Alp entrusted you to us.

01:41:41.788 --> 01:41:44.668
But if he heard your words today...

01:41:48.468 --> 01:41:49.948
he'd have done what was necessary.

01:41:50.748 --> 01:41:52.468
I stand behind my words.

01:41:53.468 --> 01:41:55.388
It's been two summers, Halime Sultan.

01:41:56.788 --> 01:42:01.348
Two whole summers
since Ertugrul Bey sent him on his duty.

01:42:05.068 --> 01:42:06.028
No word...

01:42:06.908 --> 01:42:07.988
Nothing.

01:42:13.468 --> 01:42:14.868
My Dogan will not return.

01:42:15.668 --> 01:42:16.628
I know it.

01:42:20.948 --> 01:42:21.908
Banu Cicek.

01:42:25.948 --> 01:42:28.948
When his duty ends...

01:42:30.148 --> 01:42:32.428
Dogan Alp will return to his camp.

01:42:34.708 --> 01:42:38.268
Then would you be embarrassed
of the words you've spoken?

01:42:38.748 --> 01:42:42.188
Ertugrul Bey speaks no words,
Mother Hayme.

01:42:43.108 --> 01:42:45.388
No words. Because, I know,

01:42:45.788 --> 01:42:48.068
he sent my hero away never to return.

01:42:48.148 --> 01:42:49.108
Enough!

01:42:50.188 --> 01:42:53.628
I won't let you poison the camp
with your delusions, Banu Cicek.

01:42:56.468 --> 01:42:58.508
Control these delusions,

01:42:59.468 --> 01:43:01.948
or I will execute you with my own hands.

01:43:11.028 --> 01:43:13.188
Anything else, Halime Sultan?

01:43:13.388 --> 01:43:15.468
No. You can leave.

01:43:28.348 --> 01:43:29.308
Girl.

01:43:30.268 --> 01:43:32.428
It's been a while.
Things aren't going well.

01:43:33.708 --> 01:43:36.788
This evil heralds salvation.

01:43:37.348 --> 01:43:38.468
God willing, mother.

01:43:38.908 --> 01:43:42.748
What you reap is what you sow.

01:43:44.748 --> 01:43:47.628
So, stand tall.

01:43:49.028 --> 01:43:51.148
Now you're the lady of these nomads...

01:43:52.388 --> 01:43:53.788
Ertugrul's deputy.

01:43:57.348 --> 01:44:00.548
You're the mother of all my kids
in the camp.

01:44:05.308 --> 01:44:06.268
Mother.

01:44:40.908 --> 01:44:43.948
Mother, Ertugrul Bey is here.

01:46:15.108 --> 01:46:16.148
Welcome, Bey.

01:46:19.228 --> 01:46:21.108
What is this, Bey?

01:46:26.748 --> 01:46:29.668
What the hell?
Is that enough wheat for all of us?

01:46:30.748 --> 01:46:31.788
Ertugrul Bey.

01:46:32.788 --> 01:46:35.668
We spent days hunting in the mountains.

01:46:36.828 --> 01:46:38.148
They became our home.

01:46:38.828 --> 01:46:43.148
Is that all the wheat you could buy
with the skins from the hunt?

01:46:45.428 --> 01:46:46.868
More will follow, Kara Bey.

01:46:47.828 --> 01:46:48.868
Don't you worry.

01:46:49.468 --> 01:46:52.188
Let us catch our breath
and we'll talk, be patient.

01:46:52.268 --> 01:46:53.668
How much patience do we need, Bey?

01:46:54.988 --> 01:46:56.988
We can't take it anymore.

01:47:02.788 --> 01:47:04.148
Forgive me!

01:47:04.228 --> 01:47:06.188
Who the hell is he?

01:47:06.268 --> 01:47:08.748
-It's not one of us, who is he?
-Ertugrul Bey...

01:47:10.388 --> 01:47:11.908
saved my life

01:47:12.348 --> 01:47:15.628
from the slave market, with gold
he was supposed to spend on wheat.

01:47:15.748 --> 01:47:17.028
With our gold...

01:47:26.348 --> 01:47:27.308
But...

01:47:28.668 --> 01:47:30.548
I'll return this favor.

01:47:48.188 --> 01:47:49.148
Ertugrul Bey.

01:47:50.748 --> 01:47:52.348
You've been inconvenienced.

01:47:52.468 --> 01:47:54.588
I wish you left me there
for him to kill me.

01:47:56.028 --> 01:47:56.988
Hacaturyan.

01:48:04.868 --> 01:48:06.548
Is this true, Ertugrul Bey?

01:48:06.628 --> 01:48:08.948
You wasted our gold on this heathen?

01:48:09.948 --> 01:48:11.668
We no longer have patience.

01:48:12.908 --> 01:48:17.268
We're perishing on the roads
in the name of the holy war.

01:48:17.748 --> 01:48:20.068
But all you say is, "Patience."

01:48:20.668 --> 01:48:22.828
We hear no other words.

01:48:23.108 --> 01:48:27.268
We want to know what to do.
We want a meeting tonight, Ertugrul Bey.

01:48:43.148 --> 01:48:45.628
Since when are you
going after the sustenance?

01:48:47.988 --> 01:48:49.908
God's the one who provides it, is He not?

01:48:54.988 --> 01:48:56.068
Hacaturyan

01:48:56.908 --> 01:48:58.228
is a guest of God.

01:48:59.908 --> 01:49:02.028
God's guest comes with ten loaves.

01:49:02.628 --> 01:49:03.708
Eats one...

01:49:04.828 --> 01:49:05.788
leaves nine.

01:49:08.068 --> 01:49:11.348
When did you forget
the Holy Creator's name?

01:49:15.268 --> 01:49:16.708
It's not the time for meetings.

01:49:19.028 --> 01:49:20.748
Do your share.

01:49:22.388 --> 01:49:23.348
I won't let anyone

01:49:23.988 --> 01:49:25.788
raise trouble

01:49:26.828 --> 01:49:29.428
or agitate the people here.

01:49:31.428 --> 01:49:33.628
Our life was not a bed of roses anyway.

01:49:33.988 --> 01:49:35.828
This didn't happen
because when we came here.

01:49:41.668 --> 01:49:43.108
It's not the time for meetings.

01:49:43.828 --> 01:49:45.308
That is my word.

01:50:19.148 --> 01:50:20.108
Gunduz.

01:50:23.068 --> 01:50:24.028
Father.

01:50:27.508 --> 01:50:28.468
My son.

01:50:29.388 --> 01:50:30.348
Gunduz.

01:50:31.348 --> 01:50:32.628
Heir of my blood.

01:50:45.908 --> 01:50:46.868
Son.

01:50:50.868 --> 01:50:53.348
Why refuse the meeting?

01:50:58.988 --> 01:51:00.188
What are you up to?

01:51:03.068 --> 01:51:04.028
Mother...

01:51:04.868 --> 01:51:05.828
Gunduz.

01:51:07.148 --> 01:51:08.668
My dear, go play inside.

01:51:25.788 --> 01:51:27.268
I did not refuse a meeting.

01:51:28.628 --> 01:51:32.068
I refused them asking for meetings
and agitating the people

01:51:32.188 --> 01:51:34.388
after every little difficulty.

01:51:35.628 --> 01:51:37.868
So say this in the meeting.

01:51:40.068 --> 01:51:41.668
That's what a bey does.

01:51:59.228 --> 01:52:00.228
Hayme Hatun.

01:52:02.548 --> 01:52:03.788
I'm the bey of the camp.

01:52:05.108 --> 01:52:07.588
I decide when to meet.

01:52:12.228 --> 01:52:15.508
Ertugrul Bey, do you hear yourself?
This is not our law.

01:52:17.468 --> 01:52:20.228
Why are my orders
being questioned, Halime Sultan?

01:52:22.148 --> 01:52:24.828
A Bey's word is final,
isn't that our law?

01:52:27.348 --> 01:52:28.708
If I'm the bey of this camp,

01:52:29.588 --> 01:52:30.868
I decide.

01:52:33.708 --> 01:52:36.548
This is neither the place
to question my judgments...

01:52:38.268 --> 01:52:39.668
nor is it your duty.

01:52:50.028 --> 01:52:50.988
When it's time...

01:52:52.828 --> 01:52:53.788
I'll gather the beys,

01:52:54.788 --> 01:52:55.788
and listen to them.

01:53:15.068 --> 01:53:18.065
{\an8}CAVDAR NOMADS CAMP

01:53:40.348 --> 01:53:41.428
O King of Kings...

01:53:43.268 --> 01:53:44.748
The only one...

01:53:47.468 --> 01:53:50.028
The word coming forth
from the Holy Father.

01:53:52.148 --> 01:53:56.148
As a benefactor Thou hast now
ineffably sent forth Thy Spirit,

01:53:57.388 --> 01:53:59.308
equal in might,
upon the apostles who chant,

01:53:59.788 --> 01:54:01.148
Glory to Thy dominion...

01:54:02.388 --> 01:54:03.788
O Lord.

01:54:05.188 --> 01:54:07.268
Lord, give me strength.

01:54:09.388 --> 01:54:12.268
Let me make my enemies
live in hell on earth.

01:54:15.308 --> 01:54:17.108
Bey is coming.

01:54:18.988 --> 01:54:19.948
Bey...

01:54:26.268 --> 01:54:27.348
Gather here.

01:55:42.428 --> 01:55:43.388
Toktamis Bey.

01:55:43.988 --> 01:55:45.988
Honor my table tonight.

01:55:47.068 --> 01:55:49.828
We can talk about the rugs
we'll sell to the Venetians.

01:55:50.748 --> 01:55:53.668
We've got
a lot of work to come this winter.

01:55:54.148 --> 01:55:55.468
As you wish, Bey.

01:55:55.828 --> 01:55:56.948
I am at your command.

01:56:00.108 --> 01:56:01.068
Colpan Hatun.

01:56:01.668 --> 01:56:03.628
We have guests for dinner.

01:56:07.748 --> 01:56:08.828
Prepare accordingly.

01:56:09.628 --> 01:56:11.068
Be sure nothing is missing.

01:56:11.948 --> 01:56:12.988
Yes, Bey.

01:56:24.788 --> 01:56:26.988
Aybuke, begin the preparations.

01:56:27.228 --> 01:56:28.468
Yes, Colpan Hatun.

01:56:40.068 --> 01:56:42.348
Bey? What happened to your leg?

01:56:46.748 --> 01:56:47.708
My father...

01:56:48.148 --> 01:56:49.228
He knew everything.

01:56:51.748 --> 01:56:53.788
Ural, let me do it.

01:56:58.908 --> 01:57:00.028
From now on...

01:57:01.148 --> 01:57:02.468
no more rest for anyone.

01:57:03.468 --> 01:57:07.068
If I am on a knife edge,
everyone else will be too.

01:57:12.788 --> 01:57:14.308
First, you must lose this wrath.

01:57:15.188 --> 01:57:17.188
You know a tightened rope
breaks the easiest.

01:57:18.708 --> 01:57:21.068
Everyone has an evil eye on you,
so be like a lake...

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:24.068
not a roaring river.

01:57:25.108 --> 01:57:26.828
You'll roar, when it's time.

01:57:29.468 --> 01:57:32.388
It's not good, Colpan,
that my father learned this.

01:57:32.668 --> 01:57:33.628
Not good.

01:57:35.748 --> 01:57:37.868
Who do you think he learned this from?

01:57:39.508 --> 01:57:40.468
That is...

01:57:42.188 --> 01:57:44.268
Toktamis's doing.

01:57:46.748 --> 01:57:48.188
His days are numbered.

01:57:55.828 --> 01:57:59.428
Tonight at the dinner...

01:58:00.868 --> 01:58:02.828
we're going to bury him.

01:58:11.788 --> 01:58:14.908
Before Ali Er comes,
we have to send him off.

01:58:15.868 --> 01:58:18.148
Or it gets worse for all of us.

01:58:18.228 --> 01:58:20.188
That's it.

01:58:21.828 --> 01:58:25.028
Your wrath may be like a river, after all.
Flowing slowly, but with power.

01:58:25.628 --> 01:58:30.628
Ural Bey will bring peace to these evil
lands. Whoever stands in his way...

01:58:31.068 --> 01:58:32.188
will be drowned in your wrath.

01:58:33.068 --> 01:58:35.108
This is our time.

01:58:36.068 --> 01:58:37.348
Toktamis...

01:58:38.468 --> 01:58:41.308
will have his last meal
at my father's table.

01:58:42.988 --> 01:58:44.428
So, Toktamis Effendi,

01:58:45.028 --> 01:58:47.988
you declare your own kingdom?

01:58:50.948 --> 01:58:52.508
You've made your bed, you'll sleep in it.

01:59:43.108 --> 01:59:44.348
Get rid of the bulgur.

01:59:44.788 --> 01:59:45.868
Not welcome on my table.

01:59:46.548 --> 01:59:49.508
That ropy stuff is unworthy for our Bey.

01:59:52.988 --> 01:59:54.548
Wheat will be fine.

01:59:57.028 --> 01:59:58.588
Yes, Colpan Hatun.

02:01:05.908 --> 02:01:07.628
Thank you, Colpan Hatun.

02:01:08.388 --> 02:01:11.428
An excellent feast, as always.

02:01:13.228 --> 02:01:18.748
Our beys carrying the burden of our camp
deserve the best, Toktamis Bey.

02:02:34.268 --> 02:02:36.268
How many rugs are left, Ural?

02:02:36.908 --> 02:02:39.108
Enough for the Venetians.

02:02:40.668 --> 02:02:41.828
Any discolored,

02:02:42.428 --> 02:02:44.468
or poorly crafted, Colpan?

02:02:45.068 --> 02:02:46.028
No, Bey.

02:02:47.228 --> 02:02:48.668
What about you, Aslihan?

02:02:49.388 --> 02:02:50.948
I disliked a few.

02:02:51.668 --> 02:02:54.268
The women will work tonight
to get them ready for tomorrow.

02:02:54.668 --> 02:02:56.028
Well done, my daughter.

02:02:57.068 --> 02:03:00.748
I don't want to hear
that Cavdars deliver poor quality goods.

02:03:37.268 --> 02:03:39.188
This is delicious, Colpan Hatun.

02:03:39.668 --> 02:03:41.508
Thank you, Toktamis Bey.

02:04:03.748 --> 02:04:06.228
This time the enemy will attack
with everything.

02:04:06.908 --> 02:04:08.708
So there is no time to lose.

02:04:09.548 --> 02:04:11.428
We have to be firm like a castle.

02:04:12.108 --> 02:04:13.068
Bey.

02:04:13.868 --> 02:04:15.468
An uprising is on the way.

02:04:16.588 --> 02:04:18.588
Folks are at the ends of their tethers.

02:04:19.228 --> 02:04:21.068
Damn the ungrateful.

02:04:21.908 --> 02:04:25.268
Everything is fine when they're full.
When they're hungry, the muttering starts.

02:04:25.828 --> 02:04:26.788
Alas!

02:04:27.468 --> 02:04:30.068
They've been good for a couple of years,
brother

02:04:31.108 --> 02:04:33.348
One good trade would bring hope

02:04:33.828 --> 02:04:35.548
to the people, Bey.

02:04:37.268 --> 02:04:39.348
I heard the Venetians are coming
to buy some rugs.

02:04:40.948 --> 02:04:43.388
Gather all the rugs in the camp,
immediately.

02:04:43.668 --> 02:04:45.308
Abdurrahman, Dundar,

02:04:45.828 --> 02:04:47.828
this duty is yours until we're back.

02:04:50.228 --> 02:04:54.548
Bey, if you let me,
I want to visit all the beys in the camp.

02:04:55.468 --> 02:04:57.748
So, they won't be upset
about not having a meeting.

02:04:59.308 --> 02:05:00.868
Well thought, Artuk Bey.

02:05:01.628 --> 02:05:03.068
Fill them with enthusiasm.

02:05:03.148 --> 02:05:04.108
I will.

02:05:05.588 --> 02:05:06.548
Bey.

02:05:07.468 --> 02:05:09.068
What if Sultan's man dies?

02:05:09.868 --> 02:05:13.068
What if we can't find the man
we go in search of?

02:05:16.628 --> 02:05:17.788
We have no choice.

02:05:18.868 --> 02:05:22.188
Bring him out of that market,
dead or alive, Turgut.

02:05:27.028 --> 02:05:28.308
It'll be tough

02:05:28.948 --> 02:05:31.068
to get Sultan Aladdin's spy out of that

02:05:31.348 --> 02:05:32.548
huge bazaar, Bey.

02:05:34.068 --> 02:05:35.108
How will you do that?

02:05:39.708 --> 02:05:40.628
Do you know...

02:05:41.788 --> 02:05:44.508
how wolves set up an ambush
for their prey, Dundar?

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:50.708
Listen to me closely.

02:05:55.028 --> 02:05:56.668
The first thing we'll do...

02:06:46.068 --> 02:06:50.228
We'll capture the spy of Sultan Aladdin
who settled in this land.

02:06:51.428 --> 02:06:53.108
To catch the big fish...

02:06:54.108 --> 02:06:55.908
we will use the circumcised knight
as our bait.

02:06:56.268 --> 02:06:58.348
Will he come to that bait, Master Simon?

02:06:58.468 --> 02:07:00.068
Not that easily, Philip.

02:07:02.108 --> 02:07:05.668
I assume he's smart enough to know
I'm setting a trap for him.

02:07:08.748 --> 02:07:10.308
A trap within a trap.

02:07:12.428 --> 02:07:13.268
Right.

02:07:14.508 --> 02:07:15.468
Don't forget.

02:07:16.148 --> 02:07:19.628
We must get him alive. At any cost.

02:07:24.148 --> 02:07:25.428
God help us all.

02:07:56.508 --> 02:07:58.468
Ertugrul Bey, may I?

02:07:58.948 --> 02:07:59.908
Come in, Halime.

02:08:09.068 --> 02:08:11.308
Bey, I have some things to say,
if you'll allow me.

02:08:13.068 --> 02:08:14.348
Go head, Halime. I'm listening.

02:08:17.188 --> 02:08:18.628
Bey, forgive me.

02:08:20.188 --> 02:08:21.948
I said inexcusable things.

02:08:23.268 --> 02:08:25.628
I was upset by the words of the women
in the camp,

02:08:26.428 --> 02:08:28.988
and I made the same mistake,
I acted like them.

02:08:30.228 --> 02:08:31.428
I'm sorry.

02:08:33.708 --> 02:08:35.868
These lands are surrounded
with fire, Halime.

02:08:38.868 --> 02:08:39.828
But...

02:08:40.948 --> 02:08:43.028
if we turn to Allah as Ibrahim did,

02:08:43.788 --> 02:08:46.828
that fire feels like a bed of roses.

02:08:47.748 --> 02:08:50.068
Our duty is

02:08:50.708 --> 02:08:52.268
to resign to Allah's will.

02:08:55.068 --> 02:08:56.228
With Allah, no sorrow.

02:08:58.908 --> 02:09:00.388
With Allah, no sorrow.

02:09:02.748 --> 02:09:03.828
We live in hard times.

02:09:05.588 --> 02:09:07.508
You have a lot weighing on you, I know.

02:09:08.068 --> 02:09:10.268
And that's what made you say those things.

02:09:39.428 --> 02:09:41.508
We are off hunting with the Alps tonight.

02:09:41.588 --> 02:09:43.948
I hope it will be a good one,
with God's help.

02:09:44.348 --> 02:09:45.308
God willing, Bey.

02:09:46.428 --> 02:09:48.468
I wish that your arrow hits its prey.

02:09:49.788 --> 02:09:51.348
Come home with plentiful supplies.

02:09:51.708 --> 02:09:52.668
Amen.

02:09:53.588 --> 02:09:54.868
Don't worry about us.

02:10:30.548 --> 02:10:33.668
Wolves are the only thing we've not become
and now they will fear us.

02:10:35.388 --> 02:10:38.068
Let's see what they come up with.

02:10:38.308 --> 02:10:42.828
There's nothing like a noble wolf.

02:10:43.188 --> 02:10:44.668
It looks great.

02:10:45.388 --> 02:10:48.228
A warrior bears his load on his shoulders,
Bamsi Beyrek.

02:10:48.548 --> 02:10:50.908
Aye, brother. Right you are.

02:10:56.748 --> 02:10:58.788
A warrior without a woman, Bamsi Beyrek?

02:11:13.108 --> 02:11:14.148
Brother Gonkut...

02:11:16.268 --> 02:11:17.228
Brother...

02:11:17.948 --> 02:11:22.148
Brother...
I'll chop that tongue out, brother.

02:11:23.148 --> 02:11:25.148
Chop that tongue out.

02:11:25.588 --> 02:11:28.748
Chief Turgut Alp,
these alps have no manners.

02:11:29.308 --> 02:11:32.668
They don't know how to talk to elders.

02:11:40.228 --> 02:11:41.188
<i>Salam.</i>

02:11:41.548 --> 02:11:42.828
<i>Salam,</i> Bey.

02:11:52.028 --> 02:11:53.828
Here, Bey. Your fur is ready.

02:11:54.308 --> 02:11:55.268
Good, thanks.

02:12:56.828 --> 02:12:58.708
Wolves like the foggy weather.

02:13:01.108 --> 02:13:02.068
Come on, warriors.

02:13:03.628 --> 02:13:04.628
The war is ours.

02:13:05.548 --> 02:13:06.548
The victory is Allah's.

02:13:44.009 --> 02:13:45.089
Aslıhan!

02:13:49.449 --> 02:13:50.289
Yes, Father.

02:13:50.969 --> 02:13:54.289
I see you are distracted, my daughter.
What's on your mind?

02:13:55.209 --> 02:13:56.249
Ertuğrul Bey.

02:14:01.089 --> 02:14:03.729
Today, he saved an old slave
who was about to die, Father.

02:14:06.849 --> 02:14:09.969
He did it by cutting back on the bread
that his village folk needed.

02:14:10.049 --> 02:14:12.849
What are you trying to say, daughter?

02:14:12.929 --> 02:14:16.129
I believe we have lost our compassion
for quite some time now.

02:14:17.729 --> 02:14:19.969
Did you find an answer Aslıhan Hatun?

02:14:20.569 --> 02:14:24.049
I did Çolpan Hatun. I did.

02:14:26.729 --> 02:14:29.489
When we went after gold and not valor...

02:14:32.089 --> 02:14:33.369
that is the day we lost.

02:14:37.289 --> 02:14:39.569
What was the matter
you wanted to discuss, Father?

02:14:40.009 --> 02:14:41.369
Leave us, Çolpan!

02:14:52.649 --> 02:14:54.009
You stay, Aslıhan.

02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:08.689
Father!

02:15:09.409 --> 02:15:13.209
Çolpan is my wife.
She does not deserve this treatment.

02:15:15.809 --> 02:15:17.809
I have things to attend to, Ural Bey.

02:15:20.329 --> 02:15:22.049
With your permission.

02:15:27.209 --> 02:15:32.089
Because of the embarrassing situation
you put me in today,

02:15:32.169 --> 02:15:35.169
I have seen it fit
to take certain precautions.

02:15:35.809 --> 02:15:38.009
You still believe the words
of that coward?

02:15:39.169 --> 02:15:42.889
You know exactly
what I am going to say, Ural.

02:15:43.529 --> 02:15:46.289
What I will tell you, you already know.

02:15:49.889 --> 02:15:51.009
Toktamış!

02:16:21.849 --> 02:16:23.089
Toktamış?

02:16:33.929 --> 02:16:35.169
Toktamış!

02:16:39.489 --> 02:16:40.489
Toktamış!

02:17:41.849 --> 02:17:42.689
No!
