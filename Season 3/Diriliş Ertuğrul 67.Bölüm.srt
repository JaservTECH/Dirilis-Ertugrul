00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 67 will start after 12:19 min.

13:25.947 --> 13:27.147
I trusted you.

13:27.987 --> 13:30.467
And you got us both ambushed, fool!

14:20.387 --> 14:21.347
He is alive!

14:23.107 --> 14:24.907
-He is alive.
-Oh, he is alive.

14:29.747 --> 14:30.707
He is alive!

14:34.667 --> 14:36.107
Take him to Artuk Bey right away.

14:36.427 --> 14:37.307
At once!

14:45.587 --> 14:46.947
Let the Candars know the situation.

14:47.107 --> 14:50.067
-Tell I'm after the bandits.
-As you order, my Bey.

14:52.547 --> 14:53.587
My Bey.

14:53.947 --> 14:56.227
Let me go with you.

14:58.707 --> 15:00.187
You'll slow me down, Hasan.

15:00.387 --> 15:01.787
Go to the bazaar, let them know.

15:04.627 --> 15:05.907
May God protect you, my Bey.

15:31.547 --> 15:32.707
-Come on!
-Go on!

15:49.707 --> 15:50.667
Brothers!

17:11.307 --> 17:15.067
How did the Sultan's spy know
you were coming here, Simon? How?

17:15.547 --> 17:18.267
I'll find him, blessed vizier.
Have no worries.

17:20.907 --> 17:21.947
No.

17:22.787 --> 17:24.187
This partnership is valuable.

17:24.587 --> 17:27.747
Too valuable
to let your weakness destroy it.

17:27.947 --> 17:31.267
I have offered a partnership
in which you win too.

17:31.547 --> 17:32.587
And what did you do?

17:33.187 --> 17:35.507
You are not even capable
of finding the Sultan's spy.

17:35.627 --> 17:37.467
-I will find him but--
-Silence!

17:39.387 --> 17:40.307
Don't interrupt me!

17:43.747 --> 17:44.827
As if!

17:48.507 --> 17:50.827
Sultan's spy is Ertuğrul!

17:53.147 --> 17:54.147
Right...

17:54.627 --> 17:55.627
Do you expect him

17:55.987 --> 17:58.507
to confess before you understand?

18:01.707 --> 18:02.667
Damn it!

18:04.907 --> 18:06.387
I suspected him from the beginning.

18:07.867 --> 18:08.827
But what did you do?

18:11.467 --> 18:12.427
Nothing...

18:17.307 --> 18:21.867
Ertuğrul is working day and night
to conquer Karacahisar Castle.

18:22.627 --> 18:23.907
If he conquers it...

18:24.907 --> 18:26.787
no one will be able to stop Alaeddin.

18:30.147 --> 18:32.707
So that's why you want to help us.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.667
You don't want Sultan Alaeddin
to get stronger.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.627
So you want to replace him.

18:42.947 --> 18:45.867
Or are you trying to replace him
with someone of your choosing?

18:47.747 --> 18:48.987
Oh, Köpek.

18:52.347 --> 18:54.467
If you talk to me like this again...

18:55.587 --> 18:58.347
I will rip your lungs out
and feed them to the dogs.

18:59.387 --> 19:01.507
You do your task.

19:02.867 --> 19:04.827
Keep your nose out of the rest.

20:36.187 --> 20:37.867
Go!

20:50.707 --> 20:52.107
Don't let them get away.

21:37.707 --> 21:38.867
Bamsi!

21:40.267 --> 21:41.667
-Bamsi!
-I'm fine.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.747
Go ahead! Come on, don't stop!

23:23.667 --> 23:26.347
Brothers, let's head back to the tribe.

23:28.747 --> 23:30.107
You go, brothers.

23:31.707 --> 23:34.507
I won't return to the tribe
without Ertuğrul Bey's permission.

23:35.147 --> 23:39.427
Brother, you won't make it back
if we leave you here like this.

23:39.667 --> 23:40.627
Brother...

23:41.307 --> 23:42.267
How...

23:44.027 --> 23:46.507
How will we able to look
Ertuğrul Bey's in the face?

23:49.987 --> 23:52.667
We weren't able to reveal
the spy's identity.

23:53.147 --> 23:54.667
-You go.
-Brother...

23:55.107 --> 23:58.067
Do you think Ertuğrul Bey would leave you
in such condition?

24:00.867 --> 24:03.547
We won't do any good to the tribe
if we are dead.

24:04.827 --> 24:06.347
Come on, brothers.

24:07.427 --> 24:08.387
Come on.

24:15.867 --> 24:16.827
Come on.

24:16.987 --> 24:17.947
Come on, brother.

24:18.387 --> 24:20.227
Come on.

24:25.667 --> 24:26.507
Come on.

24:41.987 --> 24:42.827
Let go!

24:54.707 --> 24:57.347
Gunduz! My boy!

24:58.507 --> 25:02.307
How could you do that?
What did you want from him?

25:03.507 --> 25:04.787
What was it?

25:12.787 --> 25:13.747
Keep...

25:14.187 --> 25:16.307
Keep your hopes up, Lady Halime.

25:17.387 --> 25:18.387
Put yourself together.

25:19.147 --> 25:20.507
You are strong.

25:25.947 --> 25:27.867
Don't let these bastards enjoy your pain.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.827
Don't tell me you let him escape!

25:48.547 --> 25:51.387
Send men after them!
Don't come back without finding him!

25:56.067 --> 25:57.027
Look at you.

25:58.587 --> 26:00.027
You can't even protect yourself.

26:45.587 --> 26:46.547
My Lady.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.067
My Banu Çiçek!

26:50.947 --> 26:52.987
Hang in there, my brother.
We're not there yet.

27:01.987 --> 27:03.147
Çiçek!

27:04.427 --> 27:05.387
Comrade Doğan!

27:05.787 --> 27:08.147
Brother Doğan!

27:08.667 --> 27:10.587
Hang in there, brother!

27:14.147 --> 27:15.107
Hang in there.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.067
-Brother.
-Yes?

27:17.387 --> 27:18.467
What is it, brother?

27:18.827 --> 27:19.787
If...

27:19.987 --> 27:21.107
If something happens to me...

27:22.707 --> 27:25.427
Nothing will happen, brother.

27:25.547 --> 27:28.227
We'll get to the tribe
and Artuk Bey will take care of you.

27:28.427 --> 27:30.907
Right! You'll be fine, my brother. Right!

27:32.627 --> 27:33.507
Brother Doğan!

27:34.107 --> 27:34.987
Brother!

27:36.307 --> 27:37.867
Doğan!! Brother!

27:38.427 --> 27:40.387
Brother! Brother Doğan!

27:42.147 --> 27:44.507
Brother!

27:47.067 --> 27:48.387
Doğan!

27:51.867 --> 27:52.707
Brother!

27:53.227 --> 27:54.187
Brother!

27:55.267 --> 27:56.467
Brother!

28:27.286 --> 28:29.726
-Stir it. Don't let it come together.
-Okay.

28:39.606 --> 28:40.526
Beautiful.

28:42.046 --> 28:43.486
They say this place is bitterly cold.

28:44.286 --> 28:46.566
This marmalade will comfort our soldiers.

28:46.646 --> 28:47.686
God willing, my lady.

28:47.766 --> 28:50.806
It's thickened up.
Time to put it in the pots.

28:53.006 --> 28:53.886
Stir it up.

28:57.686 --> 28:59.206
People! Let me through!

29:09.726 --> 29:11.206
What is it, Gunkut? What's wrong?

29:14.406 --> 29:15.366
Speak, my boy.

29:16.446 --> 29:17.486
Bandits.

29:18.806 --> 29:20.806
They intercepted our sisters, Mother.

29:33.406 --> 29:36.886
Do you hear what you're saying?

29:40.486 --> 29:42.606
Halime? Gündüz?

29:44.766 --> 29:48.926
There's no news of them.
Ertuğrul Bey went after them on his own.

29:56.366 --> 29:58.006
Horses! Gather round!

30:31.486 --> 30:33.606
Make way, come on!

30:36.006 --> 30:38.246
Artuk Bey, Ishak Bey, please help!

30:40.246 --> 30:43.766
Gündüz! Gündüz! Gündüz!

31:08.406 --> 31:10.286
My sweetheart.

31:14.766 --> 31:16.806
God!

31:25.406 --> 31:28.086
Open your eyes!

31:38.366 --> 31:39.446
Open your eyes!

31:51.886 --> 31:53.526
My dear boy!

31:53.886 --> 31:55.886
Oh my dear boy!

31:59.366 --> 32:00.886
Artuk Bey.

32:02.406 --> 32:04.086
Let's get Gündüz Bey to the tent.

32:04.726 --> 32:05.646
By God...

32:06.166 --> 32:07.686
In the name of God...

32:09.126 --> 32:10.086
Banu Çiçek,

32:10.366 --> 32:12.966
go to the healing tent at once.
Ishak will take care of your wound.

32:14.206 --> 32:15.286
<i>In the name of God...</i>

32:30.206 --> 32:31.286
Let me go.

32:33.846 --> 32:34.806
Gündüz.

32:39.086 --> 32:40.006
Gündüz!

32:53.006 --> 32:53.966
Make way!

33:11.606 --> 33:15.406
Ishak Bey! Ishak Bey!

33:17.966 --> 33:19.126
Ishak Bey!

33:20.806 --> 33:23.006
Doğan is wounded, Ishak Bey.

33:23.846 --> 33:25.126
-Doğan.
-No.

33:25.566 --> 33:26.526
Doğan!

33:44.126 --> 33:45.086
My Doğan.

33:45.926 --> 33:47.246
My Doğan, my Bey.

33:57.046 --> 33:59.046
Doğan, my brave heart.

34:00.846 --> 34:05.206
Doğan, open your eyes. Doğan?
Open your eyes. My Doğan!

34:05.886 --> 34:07.166
Please open your eyes.

34:09.206 --> 34:10.246
Doğan.

34:11.886 --> 34:12.926
My God!

34:13.246 --> 34:15.326
Don't make me suffer anymore!

34:16.486 --> 34:19.246
Don't make me suffer anymore, my God!

34:21.526 --> 34:22.606
My God!

34:23.366 --> 34:25.086
Open your eyes, Doğan!

34:26.846 --> 34:28.326
Open your eyes, my brave heart!

34:28.446 --> 34:31.966
-My Doğan, who did this to you?
-We have to take him right away.

34:32.046 --> 34:33.286
Help me, sisters.

34:33.766 --> 34:36.606
-Come on. We need to take him right away.
-Make way, people!

34:37.166 --> 34:38.326
Make way!

34:39.006 --> 34:40.366
Let us through!

34:40.726 --> 34:43.046
-Make way!
-Let us through!

34:43.566 --> 34:44.526
Make way.

34:55.526 --> 34:58.166
{\an8}THE CAVDAR TRIBE

35:01.286 --> 35:04.926
How could this happen?
Who would dare do this?

35:06.526 --> 35:10.046
What about my daughter?
Where is Aslıhan?

35:10.646 --> 35:11.766
How is she?

35:13.966 --> 35:15.046
Speak up, man!

35:25.006 --> 35:25.926
Bandits.

35:27.846 --> 35:29.406
They abducted Sultan Halime...

35:31.046 --> 35:32.486
as well as Lady Aslıhan!.

35:38.646 --> 35:39.606
My daughter...

35:41.046 --> 35:42.286
Aslıhan!

35:43.366 --> 35:46.686
Ertuğrul Bey... went after them, sir.

35:47.686 --> 35:49.166
He wanted you to know.

35:51.006 --> 35:52.406
-Kutluca!
-Yes, sir.

35:53.166 --> 35:55.486
Gather the scout Alps at once.

35:56.486 --> 35:59.046
-They are to go after them immediately!
-Right away, sir.

35:59.606 --> 36:02.526
Kutluca, take this Alp
so that his wounds can be seen to.

36:02.766 --> 36:04.446
As you wish, sir. Come.

36:08.206 --> 36:09.166
Come.

36:10.166 --> 36:11.166
Guards.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.366
Aslıhan...

36:19.406 --> 36:20.366
Where is Ural?

36:22.966 --> 36:25.366
He went to Konya, Father. Auntie said so.

36:25.846 --> 36:31.766
What business does Ural have in Konya
while the devil is attacking us here?

36:32.526 --> 36:35.566
I wouldn't know, Father.
He said he was meeting someone important.

36:41.166 --> 36:42.086
Guards!

36:46.886 --> 36:47.846
He's coming.

36:49.486 --> 36:51.086
Nobody move.

36:51.326 --> 36:53.286
Why don't we just
finish him off here, Francisco?

36:53.966 --> 36:56.686
This is supposed to look like
a simple ransom.

36:57.206 --> 36:58.766
Our employer wants it that way.

36:59.046 --> 37:02.286
Also, the ransom will make us rich.

38:59.126 --> 39:01.846
I bear witness
that there is no god but Allah...

39:03.766 --> 39:05.246
and Muhammed is the messenger.

39:09.726 --> 39:11.966
You are as brave as they say, Ertuğrul.

39:13.246 --> 39:14.326
Where are the women?

39:15.286 --> 39:17.326
They are safe until I get what I want.

39:18.286 --> 39:19.726
What do you want, you bastard?

39:20.486 --> 39:21.446
A thousand gold coins.

39:22.446 --> 39:23.766
You'll come alone.

39:24.206 --> 39:27.646
No one is to secretly follow you.
Or I will murder the women.

39:28.606 --> 39:32.366
If you harm them, I'll skin you alive.

39:36.166 --> 39:40.446
Tomorrow, when the sun reaches its zenith,
you'll bring the gold here.

39:41.446 --> 39:43.126
My men will take you to me.

39:48.486 --> 39:50.846
Tell Halime Sultan that Gündüz is alive.

39:52.526 --> 39:54.526
And that I'll kill
whoever did this to him.

40:11.406 --> 40:14.966
{\an8}HANLI BAZAAR

40:54.326 --> 40:57.086
How did the Sultan's spy
know our location?

40:57.726 --> 41:00.566
How was he there
when I met Vizier Saadettin?

41:01.606 --> 41:03.606
Maybe there is an informer among us.

41:04.926 --> 41:07.686
The four people who knew about it
swore an oath. Who do you mean?

41:09.006 --> 41:10.766
He refers to Turgut, Master Simon.

41:11.046 --> 41:13.006
-Yes.
-It's not possible.

41:13.846 --> 41:17.046
He works all day long.
I watch him constantly.

41:17.606 --> 41:20.526
Even if he had got out, he wouldn't
have been able to enter the temple.

41:22.246 --> 41:23.486
He doesn't even know the place.

41:23.686 --> 41:26.206
We can't be sure of anything, Maria.
Anything!

41:30.406 --> 41:32.006
-Master Simon.
-What is it, Petrus!

41:32.806 --> 41:35.446
The Kayi women have been
attacked by bandits.

41:37.126 --> 41:38.086
What?

41:39.086 --> 41:40.806
I saw the raid with my own eyes.

41:41.686 --> 41:43.966
It's Francisco's doing.
I know him well.

41:44.406 --> 41:46.326
He's not so stupid as
to abduct Ertuğrul's wife

41:46.486 --> 41:48.206
and the daughter of Candar Bey alone.

41:49.526 --> 41:50.886
Someone else is behind it.

41:53.006 --> 41:54.566
Who do you suspect, Master Simon?

41:55.086 --> 41:58.006
It's obvious that Ural has a hand in this.

42:01.326 --> 42:06.326
If Ertuğrul finds out the truth,
all hell will break loose.

42:08.606 --> 42:11.566
It's time to spark a war
between those two tribes.

42:17.806 --> 42:20.806
We have to prove Ural is behind this.

42:22.046 --> 42:25.486
Maria, go to Turgut at once.
He can accompany me to the tribe.

42:25.726 --> 42:27.086
-To the tribe?
-Yes.

42:28.846 --> 42:31.926
Let's find out
if Philip's suspicion is justified.

42:32.806 --> 42:33.766
We'll see.

43:05.646 --> 43:07.806
There's something I need to tell you.

43:09.046 --> 43:10.526
Something I think you'll want to know.

43:12.246 --> 43:15.086
The women who were coming
to the bazaar have been attacked.

43:18.566 --> 43:20.766
Halime and Lady Aslıhan were abducted.

43:26.206 --> 43:27.406
I'm not at all surprised.

43:31.486 --> 43:33.766
Ertuğrul has failed once again
to protect his loved ones.

43:40.606 --> 43:43.126
His son Gündüz was mortally wounded, too.

43:58.566 --> 44:00.486
Ertuğrul has got what he deserved.

44:03.806 --> 44:05.326
But I'm sorry for his son.

44:12.006 --> 44:13.926
Simon is going to the tribe soon.

44:14.246 --> 44:16.446
You are a conscientious man.

44:18.006 --> 44:20.086
You can go with him if you like.
At least--

44:20.206 --> 44:22.046
I don't want to see Ertuğrul's face.

44:24.086 --> 44:25.846
Still, I think you'd better go.

44:27.886 --> 44:31.366
If you go, there's no risk
of us offending Ertuğrul Bey.

44:48.206 --> 44:49.166
You are right.

44:50.086 --> 44:52.966
My anger towards him
shouldn't hinder your brother's work.

44:54.406 --> 44:57.206
I don't want him to think badly of Simon
because of me.

45:05.286 --> 45:06.486
Stay strong.

45:14.406 --> 45:18.966
Degenerate scum! I'll kill you!

45:28.006 --> 45:30.486
Come to your senses, woman!
What do you think you can do?

45:32.966 --> 45:36.246
What are you going to do?
Kill me too?

45:37.566 --> 45:42.686
You've already taken my son's life.
I don't care if you kill me too.

45:44.246 --> 45:46.366
So you want to be reunited with your son?

45:47.446 --> 45:51.566
Then behave so that I let you live.

45:52.446 --> 45:55.086
Is my son alive? Does he live?

45:57.446 --> 45:59.926
You'll never find out...

46:00.846 --> 46:02.646
if you do such a stupid thing again.

46:02.806 --> 46:04.326
You bastard!

46:05.806 --> 46:09.846
I swear I'll be the one
to take your life. I swear to God!

46:11.246 --> 46:12.566
Tie them up!

46:15.366 --> 46:17.086
Let me go!

47:01.286 --> 47:02.886
How is my son, Artuk Bey?

47:03.366 --> 47:06.966
I've done what I can, sir.
The rest is up to God.

47:07.486 --> 47:11.326
God willing, when he opens
his eyes and talks again,

47:12.006 --> 47:13.726
the danger will have passed.

47:19.566 --> 47:21.086
I'll wait for you in the tent, sir.

47:21.886 --> 47:22.846
Thank you.

47:27.846 --> 47:29.886
Son, what's going on?

47:30.806 --> 47:32.206
Is there any news of Halime?

47:32.566 --> 47:35.726
They've demanded 1,000 gold coins
to release them both tomorrow.

47:45.566 --> 47:50.846
They continue their attacks...
upon us, like a plague.

47:51.966 --> 47:53.446
Upon our households...

47:54.446 --> 47:55.926
upon our women and children...

47:58.526 --> 48:00.686
Who are they, son? Who?

48:01.446 --> 48:03.446
This place is infested
with treacherous bastards.

48:04.486 --> 48:05.766
Whether one or all...

48:06.926 --> 48:08.526
Whoever did this, I will find them.

48:09.006 --> 48:10.446
And rip their lungs out.

48:19.926 --> 48:23.486
Sir. Candar Bey and Aliyar Bey are here.

48:23.846 --> 48:24.806
Thank you.

49:05.806 --> 49:07.526
May you recover swiftly, Ertuğrul Bey.

49:07.966 --> 49:11.206
Thank you, Candar Bey.
I hope we all recover quickly from this.

49:11.726 --> 49:12.686
Please, take a seat.

49:20.766 --> 49:24.526
How... can something
like this have happened?

49:25.726 --> 49:28.286
They have no business with our women!

49:28.926 --> 49:30.886
They're holding them for ransom.

49:32.406 --> 49:34.646
They've demanded
1,000 gold coins for them.

49:36.486 --> 49:40.646
If that's the case...
I'm willing to pay the whole amount.

49:41.606 --> 49:43.446
It's not just about the gold, Candar Bey.

49:44.046 --> 49:45.406
What else then, sir?

49:48.086 --> 49:50.486
No bandits are so stupid
as to openly challenge

49:50.606 --> 49:53.446
the two most powerful tribes in the land.

49:55.606 --> 49:59.686
First, let's pay the ransom
and save our women.

50:00.766 --> 50:05.486
Then, we hunt them down and crush them,
and learn their true intention.

50:06.446 --> 50:09.646
Ertuğrul Bey... let me do this.

50:14.206 --> 50:16.446
We at least owe you that much, thank you.

50:18.086 --> 50:19.046
Kutluca.

50:20.446 --> 50:21.766
What if the true intention...

50:23.406 --> 50:25.566
is to get the gold and kill you, Bey?

50:25.966 --> 50:28.046
I'd give it a try
if I were them, Aliyar Bey.

50:30.046 --> 50:30.966
They know well...

50:31.926 --> 50:33.446
that if they leave me alive...

50:34.126 --> 50:35.766
I will take their lives.

50:43.926 --> 50:45.126
I don't see Ural Bey here.

50:47.086 --> 50:50.126
He went to Konya. He'll be back tomorrow.

52:37.446 --> 52:39.566
You are just in time to share my meal.

52:40.526 --> 52:42.046
I prepared it myself.

52:56.646 --> 52:59.126
I rubbed it in dried cherries
before roasting.

52:59.766 --> 53:02.966
I know what refined tastes
you have, Vizier.

53:10.846 --> 53:12.486
But there's something
I'd like you to know.

53:13.886 --> 53:15.886
Your hostility towards Ertuğrul...

53:16.446 --> 53:21.566
has got to the point that it risks
harming both our interests.

53:23.446 --> 53:24.926
What do you mean, blessed Vizier?

53:32.326 --> 53:36.046
Ertuğrul's worth in our Sultan's eyes

53:36.726 --> 53:38.726
is greater than you can imagine.

53:43.526 --> 53:47.406
All I know is how troublesome he is.

53:47.766 --> 53:51.286
Since he arrived, no one
has enjoyed a moment of peace.

53:53.206 --> 53:56.646
I want Ertuğrul to meet his doom
as much as you do.

53:58.126 --> 54:01.006
But things have their own way
of coming to pass.

54:05.966 --> 54:09.046
If you don't resolve matters
quietly and smoothly,

54:09.606 --> 54:12.646
they'll get worse.

54:13.686 --> 54:16.646
Especially now that
the Sultan has decided to...

54:17.086 --> 54:19.846
conquer Karacahisar Castle.

54:22.246 --> 54:28.246
After the conquest, who do you think
he'll leave to rule over these lands?

54:32.166 --> 54:33.166
Ertuğrul.

54:43.486 --> 54:46.046
You are soon to be
the leader of the Cavdars,

54:49.606 --> 54:51.806
so you have to learn
to contain your anger.

54:56.806 --> 54:59.806
-Your brother Aliyar...
-What about him?

55:00.406 --> 55:03.046
I heard your father
prefers to put him in charge of things.

55:04.366 --> 55:08.166
Aliyar on one hand,
Ertuğrul on the other.

55:12.006 --> 55:13.326
It'll be hard for you.

55:17.006 --> 55:18.166
But don't worry.

55:21.086 --> 55:24.366
I want to see you as the Bey of Cavdars
and Head of the Principality.

55:27.086 --> 55:30.366
I'm ready to do whatever you want me
to do, blessed Vizier.

55:33.126 --> 55:35.606
The Cavdars are the largest
tribe in the area.

55:36.246 --> 55:38.006
It'll be in everyone's interests

55:38.326 --> 55:43.206
for a brave Bey like you
to lead such a tribe.

55:46.446 --> 55:47.406
So...

55:50.206 --> 55:54.806
Until you hear from me again, you'll
end your hostility towards Ertuğrul.

55:56.206 --> 55:57.966
You'll act like a friend to him.

55:59.646 --> 56:01.206
As you command, blessed Emir.

56:01.966 --> 56:06.006
Very well. Very well.
Come on then...

56:07.246 --> 56:08.286
Let's feast.

56:24.886 --> 56:27.646
Innkeeper Simon and Turgut Alp are here.

57:08.166 --> 57:11.366
Ertuğrul Bey, Candar Bey.
I heard what happened.

57:12.166 --> 57:14.366
I'll do everything I can to help.

57:15.086 --> 57:16.726
My men are at your command.

57:18.806 --> 57:20.406
I appreciate that, Innkeeper Simon.

57:21.126 --> 57:24.446
I could ask Karacahisar's governor
for help, if necessary.

57:24.806 --> 57:26.246
He would send his soldiers.

57:26.806 --> 57:29.846
The more of us there are, the better
our chances of finding the women.

57:31.766 --> 57:32.726
We...

57:33.366 --> 57:37.286
will deal with this matter ourselves,
Master Simon.

57:42.206 --> 57:43.486
Why are you here, Turgut?

57:44.606 --> 57:46.046
Merely to extend my good wishes.

57:48.246 --> 57:51.566
Go on your way, Turgut.
I have nothing to say to you.

57:54.326 --> 57:59.886
None of this would have happened
if you'd gone after the men

58:03.126 --> 58:04.726
who attacked our Alps in the first place.

58:07.326 --> 58:09.126
Don't say another word, Turgut.

58:28.526 --> 58:31.286
I understand.
You are in great pain, Ertuğrul Bey.

58:33.406 --> 58:36.366
I am deeply sorry
about Halime Sultan and Gündüz.

58:40.526 --> 58:41.486
But...

58:42.526 --> 58:45.566
you are the reason all this has happened.

59:03.606 --> 59:04.726
They doubt my intentions, Bey.

59:22.526 --> 59:24.526
Never come here again, Turgut.

59:35.886 --> 59:37.486
I'll let this one go...

59:39.726 --> 59:41.526
because of the years we spent together.

59:42.846 --> 59:44.046
But...

59:45.606 --> 59:47.246
if it happens again

59:48.606 --> 59:49.886
you'll pay dearly for it.

59:52.606 --> 59:53.566
Turgut.

59:55.806 --> 59:56.766
Turgut!

01:00:01.926 --> 01:00:03.446
I'm used to betrayal, Simon.

01:00:05.086 --> 01:00:06.846
We have enemies rather than friends.

01:00:48.366 --> 01:00:51.366
I'm leaving. Stay sharp.

01:01:04.246 --> 01:01:05.206
Halime Sultan.

01:01:07.126 --> 01:01:08.486
We have to get out of here.

01:01:09.886 --> 01:01:12.806
You are right, Aslıhan. And we will.

01:01:15.406 --> 01:01:17.006
We should help each other.

01:01:22.886 --> 01:01:23.966
The ropes are tight.

01:01:24.926 --> 01:01:28.126
We'll have to loosen them first.

01:01:30.366 --> 01:01:31.606
Do your best.

01:02:19.606 --> 01:02:20.926
I have seen so many summers.

01:02:23.446 --> 01:02:24.726
I waited so many winters.

01:02:28.326 --> 01:02:29.846
I ate if I found food.

01:02:31.726 --> 01:02:33.286
If not, I went hungry.

01:02:37.246 --> 01:02:38.406
I've traveled many roads.

01:02:41.326 --> 01:02:42.766
You were never there.

01:02:48.246 --> 01:02:49.926
Was love supposed to be like this?

01:02:54.006 --> 01:02:55.046
We were supposed...

01:02:56.126 --> 01:03:00.126
to be together on happy and on sad days.

01:03:16.486 --> 01:03:18.486
He was killed on the battlefield, I said.

01:03:21.526 --> 01:03:22.846
He got captured, I said.

01:03:26.286 --> 01:03:27.646
He forgot me, I said.

01:03:32.286 --> 01:03:34.286
No one ever had any news.

01:03:38.526 --> 01:03:39.926
You disappeared, my Doğan.

01:03:43.006 --> 01:03:44.206
You disappeared from me.

01:03:45.926 --> 01:03:47.566
You left me all alone.

01:03:52.286 --> 01:03:53.566
Not only was I captured.

01:03:57.326 --> 01:03:59.566
I fought on many battlefields.

01:04:03.846 --> 01:04:05.846
I slept on the earth.

01:04:08.526 --> 01:04:09.686
With nothing to cover myself.

01:04:12.126 --> 01:04:13.046
I got so cold.

01:04:15.526 --> 01:04:16.926
Then I was roasted under the sun.

01:04:17.606 --> 01:04:18.566
Spent many hungry days.

01:04:21.366 --> 01:04:22.846
Yet, I came back to you, my flower.

01:04:31.286 --> 01:04:33.166
You'll leave again once you're healed.

01:04:36.166 --> 01:04:38.246
Leave me all alone once again.

01:04:40.286 --> 01:04:44.686
Tell me, my Doğan.
What kind of life is this?

01:04:47.166 --> 01:04:48.766
My lips are sealed, Lady Çiçek.

01:04:51.886 --> 01:04:53.646
I can't explain it to anyone but my Bey.

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:57.046
But...

01:04:59.046 --> 01:05:03.086
I won't truly be healed
until I have you by my side.

01:06:13.806 --> 01:06:15.006
I kept my promise.

01:06:17.086 --> 01:06:19.926
The birds are in the cage.
Now it's your turn, Amanda.

01:06:21.326 --> 01:06:22.446
What's up, Hasan?

01:06:23.886 --> 01:06:25.366
Who are you hunting?

01:06:28.166 --> 01:06:31.726
Francisco went into Amanda's shop.

01:06:34.726 --> 01:06:35.686
Ural...

01:06:37.446 --> 01:06:39.966
So, you used Amanda.

01:06:40.966 --> 01:06:42.726
You're not done yet, Francisco.

01:06:43.446 --> 01:06:47.966
You've to kill them all
when Ertuğrul brings the ransom.

01:06:48.766 --> 01:06:50.246
Then, you are to forget everything.

01:06:53.126 --> 01:06:54.726
Do you think me some sort of fool?

01:06:55.566 --> 01:06:57.966
Tell me... who's behind this?

01:06:58.646 --> 01:07:01.446
Did you really think I'd do
a job like this for such a low price?

01:07:01.646 --> 01:07:02.806
Who's behind it?

01:07:03.406 --> 01:07:05.006
Speak up or I'll gut you.

01:07:06.086 --> 01:07:07.006
Speak!

01:07:07.766 --> 01:07:08.966
U...

01:07:11.126 --> 01:07:14.406
Ural Bey. Son of Candar Bey.

01:07:16.326 --> 01:07:18.006
This just got a lot bigger.

01:07:22.566 --> 01:07:25.526
Tell your Bey, the price just doubled.

01:07:26.246 --> 01:07:28.886
Or I'll cut his head off too.

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:34.726
We have to find out what they're saying.

01:07:36.606 --> 01:07:37.846
We will, now.

01:08:57.862 --> 01:08:58.822
My God,

01:09:02.502 --> 01:09:04.182
you giveth and you taketh.

01:09:09.182 --> 01:09:10.302
Do not take my child.

01:09:13.102 --> 01:09:15.142
Do not test me
with the grief of losing a child.

01:09:16.302 --> 01:09:17.262
Amen.

01:09:36.822 --> 01:09:37.782
Dündar...

01:09:46.382 --> 01:09:48.622
You will lead the tribe while I am gone.

01:09:50.782 --> 01:09:52.782
-If something happens to me--
-Brother...

01:09:54.462 --> 01:09:55.662
God forbid, brother.

01:09:56.902 --> 01:09:58.302
What would we do without you?

01:10:02.102 --> 01:10:03.582
Dündar Bey, son of Suleyman Shah.

01:10:04.902 --> 01:10:07.782
A bey is never afraid.

01:10:09.142 --> 01:10:11.822
He protects his tribe, no matter what.

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:16.982
If something happens to me,
responsibility falls to you.

01:10:24.822 --> 01:10:26.182
Don't worry about us, brother.

01:10:29.822 --> 01:10:31.702
If Suleyman Shah was alive...

01:10:34.982 --> 01:10:36.662
he would be very proud of you both.

01:10:41.182 --> 01:10:44.942
Go to it.
We have work to do.

01:11:01.222 --> 01:11:05.662
We have striven to make things better
and now this malice...

01:11:06.622 --> 01:11:09.662
We are being tested, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:11:11.182 --> 01:11:13.262
We can rest when we die, Candar Bey.

01:11:16.342 --> 01:11:17.942
We can find a way.

01:11:20.582 --> 01:11:22.422
You must have a plan, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:11:23.982 --> 01:11:26.982
Let us join you in it.

01:11:27.822 --> 01:11:30.782
Such a treacherous man
would do anything for gold, Aliyar Bey.

01:11:33.182 --> 01:11:34.662
He wants me to come alone.

01:11:35.742 --> 01:11:37.462
Otherwise, our women will be at risk.

01:11:38.022 --> 01:11:40.262
You must have some idea
of their whereabouts, Bey.

01:11:40.982 --> 01:11:43.902
Let us go there ahead of you and hide.
They won't see us.

01:11:44.302 --> 01:11:45.622
It's too dangerous, Aliyar Bey.

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:49.902
I met them at Akkozak Road.
I don't know where their hideout is.

01:11:50.702 --> 01:11:54.542
They'll post lookouts everywhere
before I get there.

01:11:55.982 --> 01:12:00.262
If we knew where they were
holding the women, then maybe...

01:12:03.422 --> 01:12:07.702
We can't stand by and do nothing, Bey.
I'll go to the bazaar tomorrow morning.

01:12:08.062 --> 01:12:11.422
I'll ask everyone who this bastard is
and where he might be hiding.

01:12:13.222 --> 01:12:18.302
For your woman, for my daughter,
you risked your life, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:21.782
I will not forget this favor.

01:12:23.942 --> 01:12:25.022
Thank you, Candar Bey.

01:12:34.582 --> 01:12:35.862
I have the gold, Bey.

01:12:49.822 --> 01:12:51.102
I'll take my leave, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:13:01.182 --> 01:13:03.262
May God help you, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:13:05.622 --> 01:13:06.662
Thank you, Candar Bey.

01:13:20.942 --> 01:13:21.982
Why is Ural absent?

01:13:24.022 --> 01:13:25.182
What is he doing in Konya?

01:13:26.782 --> 01:13:29.822
We have to learn the answers
to these questions, Dündar.

01:13:40.502 --> 01:13:41.422
Magnificent.

01:13:41.902 --> 01:13:44.022
Brother. Greetings.

01:13:44.222 --> 01:13:47.022
-Greetings, brother.
-Greetings, brothers.

01:13:48.662 --> 01:13:50.222
You look good, brother.

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:54.862
Recover quickly, brother.

01:13:55.382 --> 01:13:57.222
You have cheated death, thank God.

01:13:59.182 --> 01:14:01.062
Recover quickly, brother.
May God heal you soon.

01:14:02.382 --> 01:14:03.742
Thank you, brothers.

01:14:05.142 --> 01:14:06.742
How is your wound, Samsa?

01:14:07.062 --> 01:14:09.182
My wound is fine, brother. But...

01:14:11.022 --> 01:14:13.142
I am disappointed
I didn't fulfil my duty.

01:14:18.862 --> 01:14:22.022
Hey... Why the long faces?

01:14:23.502 --> 01:14:26.102
When did we ever leave
our duty unfulfilled?

01:14:28.662 --> 01:14:30.582
That's not our only concern, Bamsi.

01:14:31.622 --> 01:14:35.782
Halime Sultan and Aslıhan Hatun
are at the mercy of a bandit.

01:14:40.062 --> 01:14:42.062
I understood you well, brothers.

01:14:42.582 --> 01:14:47.102
Just... Just hear me out, brothers.
Listen to me.

01:14:51.022 --> 01:14:51.942
Brothers,

01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:58.182
once upon a time, there was a tiger
which kept attacking the Turk tribes.

01:14:59.502 --> 01:15:02.742
It attacked every herd,
killed every shepherd.

01:15:04.462 --> 01:15:07.862
People were thinking
"What are we going to do?"

01:15:08.462 --> 01:15:10.382
Then Khan heard of the situation.

01:15:11.342 --> 01:15:13.142
Khan. Khan was bursting with anger.

01:15:14.062 --> 01:15:17.302
He said, "When my people
are suffering attacks by this tiger,

01:15:18.182 --> 01:15:20.782
how can I still call myself a Khan?"

01:15:21.862 --> 01:15:25.622
He sent 20 Alps along with
his best man to the nomad camping side.

01:15:27.822 --> 01:15:29.742
Khan also had a son.

01:15:30.742 --> 01:15:35.182
He went to his father and said,
"Father, let me go there too.

01:15:35.742 --> 01:15:41.462
Let me go, so I can show the world
that I am a worthy son,

01:15:42.022 --> 01:15:42.982
Father."

01:15:44.062 --> 01:15:50.222
Brothers, Khan's son was strong.
But he was also very young.

01:15:51.942 --> 01:15:55.702
His father said,
"Son, I know you are excited,

01:15:56.422 --> 01:16:00.102
but your time has not come yet."

01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:04.222
Unwillingly, his son had to accept that.

01:16:05.222 --> 01:16:11.102
Brothers, while Khan's 20 Alps and his
best man were searching for the tiger,

01:16:11.782 --> 01:16:13.902
they suddenly heard a great roar!

01:16:14.902 --> 01:16:19.302
Before they even saw it,
the tiger had torn the 20 Alps to pieces!

01:16:22.222 --> 01:16:26.502
And when the tiger was
about to kill Khan's best man too...

01:16:27.742 --> 01:16:33.502
Khan's son appeared and throttled
the tiger with his bare hands!

01:16:35.502 --> 01:16:37.302
That mighty tiger, brothers,

01:16:38.182 --> 01:16:41.702
died at the hands of that brave man!

01:16:48.182 --> 01:16:51.582
So, brothers, from that day on,

01:16:52.222 --> 01:16:56.142
that brave man went by the name of Tunga.

01:16:58.502 --> 01:17:02.102
This is the story of our ancestor,
Er Tunga Alp.

01:17:02.582 --> 01:17:05.622
Brothers. Our ancestors were wolves!

01:17:06.582 --> 01:17:09.502
Our Bey is just like
his ancestor Alp Er Tunga,

01:17:09.782 --> 01:17:11.382
ready to stand against the whole world!

01:17:16.182 --> 01:17:19.622
Brothers, even though times have changed,

01:17:20.222 --> 01:17:21.822
even though years have passed,

01:17:22.302 --> 01:17:24.742
that blood is the same blood, brothers!

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:28.142
Family is the same family, brothers!

01:17:30.422 --> 01:17:33.622
We have known lots of brave men,
brothers, and have many legends.

01:17:34.742 --> 01:17:38.502
Now is the time for Ertuğrul Bey
to write his own legend.

01:17:41.622 --> 01:17:44.222
May God strengthen Ertuğrul Bey.

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:45.662
-Amen!
-Amen!

01:17:45.822 --> 01:17:50.062
May God give him and we Alps
many more victories!

01:17:50.462 --> 01:17:51.302
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:17:51.662 --> 01:17:52.622
Amen.

01:17:53.662 --> 01:17:54.622
Brothers...

01:17:55.302 --> 01:17:56.662
Brothers, I hope one day...

01:17:57.422 --> 01:18:01.902
people will tell
the legend of Ertuğrul Bey.

01:18:02.262 --> 01:18:03.222
Amen.

01:18:03.822 --> 01:18:05.062
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:18:05.142 --> 01:18:06.422
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:18:07.142 --> 01:18:08.662
Amen, brothers. Amen.

01:18:23.862 --> 01:18:25.622
Ertuğrul is a very dangerous man.

01:18:27.222 --> 01:18:28.422
And he is not stupid.

01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:31.302
He'll come alone tomorrow, as I said.

01:18:33.182 --> 01:18:34.862
But we'll take precautions anyway.

01:18:36.342 --> 01:18:40.782
You, take four men with you
and wait for Ertuğrul at Akkozak.

01:18:42.142 --> 01:18:43.742
The rest will hide.

01:18:46.022 --> 01:18:49.502
If he doesn't come alone, kill them all.

01:18:54.462 --> 01:18:55.862
And kill the women, too.

01:19:04.542 --> 01:19:06.302
The enemies within...

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:12.822
and the enemies without did not allow us
a single moment of peace, Aslıhan.

01:19:16.182 --> 01:19:17.222
First, my father...

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:20.782
then my brother...

01:19:22.982 --> 01:19:24.422
and now my Gündüz.

01:19:32.102 --> 01:19:36.502
I still remember the day I told Ertuğrul
I was pregnant as if it was yesterday.

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:42.142
<i>I'm pregnant, Ertuğrul.</i>

01:19:45.942 --> 01:19:47.102
We will have a baby.

01:19:55.302 --> 01:19:56.982
Praise God!

01:19:57.982 --> 01:20:01.982
The blue sky and the dark ground,
witness me!

01:20:02.382 --> 01:20:03.902
I will be a father!

01:20:04.822 --> 01:20:06.622
Keep calm, it's too soon for this!

01:20:08.622 --> 01:20:10.182
How can I be calm, my darling?

01:20:10.702 --> 01:20:13.142
Our whole tribe has been
looking forward to this news.

01:20:13.902 --> 01:20:15.502
<i>Gündüz will have a sibling, Bey.</i>

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:22.302
I'm pregnant. We will have another child,
God willing.

01:20:27.942 --> 01:20:30.942
Praise God!

01:20:38.062 --> 01:20:40.342
They say fate will protect
a man from his death.

01:20:42.942 --> 01:20:47.542
If God allows it, you will meet
Gündüz again.

01:20:49.182 --> 01:20:50.702
God willing, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:20:52.302 --> 01:20:53.262
God willing.

01:21:02.782 --> 01:21:04.662
We couldn't hear what they were saying.

01:21:05.582 --> 01:21:08.102
But it's obvious they did this together.

01:21:08.942 --> 01:21:13.102
Just as I guessed.
Ural was behind this, too.

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:17.022
So, Ural has been using
Amanda to spy on us.

01:21:17.782 --> 01:21:19.662
I'll make her pay for this.

01:21:21.262 --> 01:21:23.142
There is going to be a lot of bloodshed.

01:21:24.542 --> 01:21:28.982
When Ertuğrul learns what's happened,
he'll do anything to kill Ural.

01:21:29.742 --> 01:21:32.422
He will not let the killer of his wife
and son live.

01:21:33.662 --> 01:21:35.582
Nor will Candar allow it.

01:21:36.862 --> 01:21:41.862
When we give Amanda to Ertuğrul Bey,
the rest will be easy.

01:21:43.342 --> 01:21:45.742
What if Amanda refuses
to tell Ertuğrul what she knows?

01:21:47.142 --> 01:21:50.462
We will do what is necessary.
Right, Maria?

01:21:51.742 --> 01:21:54.542
I can make her
sing like a bird, Master Simon.

01:21:56.222 --> 01:21:59.342
Petrus, keep an eye on Amanda's stall.

01:21:59.942 --> 01:22:03.222
Ural is bound to go there
in order to find out what's happening.

01:22:04.622 --> 01:22:05.942
We can trust Turgut.

01:22:09.702 --> 01:22:11.462
I saw it today with my own eyes.

01:22:11.862 --> 01:22:14.102
I will use him when war
breaks out between the tribes.

01:22:14.662 --> 01:22:17.622
Don't push him. Do you understand?

01:22:21.382 --> 01:22:22.622
Yes, Master Simon.

01:23:09.982 --> 01:23:13.862
My God, please protect my bey, my tribe...

01:23:14.822 --> 01:23:16.302
and all the people I love.

01:23:18.782 --> 01:23:20.262
Do not take Gündüz from us.

01:23:22.022 --> 01:23:26.062
Allow the safe return of Halime Sultan.

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:30.622
Do not test us through
our loved ones anymore, God.

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:46.982
God, bless the souls of my Alps,
may they rest in peace.

01:23:48.422 --> 01:23:54.782
Help me see the day I take my revenge
on the traitors who killed my Alps.

01:23:56.582 --> 01:24:01.982
God, do not take my life
before I avenge them.

01:24:04.822 --> 01:24:05.782
Amen.

01:24:06.502 --> 01:24:07.422
Amen.

01:24:12.902 --> 01:24:14.822
Although we worship differently,

01:24:16.502 --> 01:24:18.222
our prayers are the same, Turgut.

01:24:21.462 --> 01:24:23.982
I hope God will answer
all of your prayers.

01:24:26.742 --> 01:24:27.862
Thank you, Maria.

01:24:29.902 --> 01:24:32.262
I am waiting for the day He does.

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:35.982
My only aim in life...

01:24:37.062 --> 01:24:38.742
is to take my revenge...

01:24:40.182 --> 01:24:42.422
so that I may start breathing
with peace again.

01:24:44.982 --> 01:24:46.462
I live only for this.

01:24:47.502 --> 01:24:49.862
I am keenly awaiting that day too.

01:24:51.902 --> 01:24:54.262
When you are able to ease
your suffering and be happy again...

01:24:55.262 --> 01:24:56.942
that day, I will be happy, too.

01:25:11.822 --> 01:25:14.822
You should have
a better reunion than this.

01:25:16.142 --> 01:25:20.462
Our real reunion will be the day
our tribe finds peace.

01:25:23.342 --> 01:25:24.742
You are right, Doğan.

01:25:25.502 --> 01:25:29.302
We cannot be happy
when our tribe is in misery.

01:25:32.182 --> 01:25:33.462
May I come in?

01:25:37.782 --> 01:25:39.062
Sit tight, brother.

01:25:41.142 --> 01:25:45.422
You have a lot to talk about. Excuse me.

01:25:50.102 --> 01:25:54.142
I said some terrible things to you...

01:25:56.342 --> 01:25:58.462
but it was only because I was
so worried about Doğan.

01:26:01.382 --> 01:26:02.502
Please forgive me.

01:26:06.102 --> 01:26:08.662
Thank you for risking your life
when they attacked.

01:26:10.302 --> 01:26:11.982
We cannot thank you enough.

01:26:24.022 --> 01:26:24.982
Bey,

01:26:25.582 --> 01:26:29.542
Karacahisar Castle is okay now.
I know its every detail:

01:26:30.782 --> 01:26:33.742
how many entrances it has,
how many exits it has,

01:26:34.382 --> 01:26:36.582
where the guards stand,
I know everything.

01:26:37.062 --> 01:26:39.782
They are in my pocket, and in my mind.

01:26:45.422 --> 01:26:49.222
You have discovered so much for us.

01:26:50.902 --> 01:26:53.582
Such information will be crucial
at the time of conquest, Doğan.

01:26:57.662 --> 01:27:01.262
Now, get well soon.
That day has not yet come.

01:27:03.102 --> 01:27:05.022
I wish we could come with you, Bey.

01:27:05.182 --> 01:27:08.382
Yes, Bey.
We can't stand to see you go alone.

01:27:09.942 --> 01:27:11.382
God is with us, brothers.

01:27:14.622 --> 01:27:17.542
-Give me your blessing.
-I give you my blessing, Bey.

01:27:36.222 --> 01:27:37.302
Brother...

01:28:10.462 --> 01:28:12.982
-Don't be scared. It's me.
-Ural Bey!

01:28:13.822 --> 01:28:17.742
I wanted to talk to you inside
because I don't want anybody to see me.

01:28:18.102 --> 01:28:19.502
Are you okay? What's happening?

01:28:26.662 --> 01:28:27.862
Did Francisco come?

01:28:28.462 --> 01:28:32.822
Yes, he did. He kidnapped Aslıhan
and Halime, just like you said.

01:28:33.262 --> 01:28:35.542
And he gave your message to Ertuğrul Bey.

01:28:35.942 --> 01:28:39.742
He said, "If you don't bring
1,000 gold coins, I will kill them both."

01:28:40.382 --> 01:28:41.342
Good.

01:28:41.742 --> 01:28:43.862
Ertuğrul doesn't have that sort of money,

01:28:43.982 --> 01:28:45.702
so he'll either go
with his Alps and fight,

01:28:46.062 --> 01:28:48.182
or my father will give him
the 1,000 gold coins.

01:28:48.902 --> 01:28:52.182
It doesn't matter which.
He'll still fall into Francisco's trap.

01:28:53.022 --> 01:28:57.342
Francisco's men are strong fighters
who've fought with the Crusader Army.

01:29:01.862 --> 01:29:03.662
Ertuğrul will die there.

01:29:05.782 --> 01:29:09.222
-However, we have a problem, Bey.
-What is it?

01:29:10.222 --> 01:29:13.462
Francisco broke the agreement.
He wants double the amount.

01:29:15.262 --> 01:29:17.422
Did you expect anything less
from a bandit?

01:29:19.502 --> 01:29:20.582
Listen to me.

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:24.302
If he finds out it was me who
planned this, I'll cut your throat.

01:29:25.502 --> 01:29:27.662
Don't worry, Bey. He won't.

01:29:31.062 --> 01:29:32.862
Why are you still worried?

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:38.982
I am going to save Ertuğrul, his wife,
and my sister from that bandit.

01:29:40.302 --> 01:29:41.422
What do you mean, Bey?

01:29:43.062 --> 01:29:44.662
I'll explain later.

01:29:45.222 --> 01:29:50.262
But I have missed you so much.
I want to spend the night with you.

01:30:51.662 --> 01:30:52.622
My God,

01:30:54.102 --> 01:30:56.262
I am in great trouble.
I seek your refuge.

01:30:58.542 --> 01:31:00.862
Deliver me from this cruel plot.

01:31:03.582 --> 01:31:06.902
My God, I know that with every difficulty,
there is relief.

01:31:09.022 --> 01:31:11.942
Help me save my wife
from those brutal bandits.

01:31:14.022 --> 01:31:17.622
Help me send those
who hurt my wife to hell.

01:31:19.382 --> 01:31:21.422
Give me victory over my enemy.

01:31:23.422 --> 01:31:24.342
Amen.

01:32:36.862 --> 01:32:37.822
Halime.

01:32:40.102 --> 01:32:41.022
My wife.

01:32:43.902 --> 01:32:44.942
My precious.

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:48.862
My only love.

01:32:52.542 --> 01:32:57.342
How can I sleep here when
you are at the mercy of a bandit?

01:33:03.142 --> 01:33:07.262
How can I sit here while
you wait for me in tears?

01:33:14.582 --> 01:33:15.702
My darling one.

01:33:18.342 --> 01:33:20.582
If your beautiful eyes fill with tears,

01:33:21.982 --> 01:33:23.302
I would be a thunderstorm.

01:33:26.982 --> 01:33:31.702
Without you, my tent is a dungeon
and my bed is an enemy to me.

01:33:33.222 --> 01:33:35.542
I cannot live here like this anymore.

01:34:03.822 --> 01:34:06.702
Son, my dear son.

01:34:08.942 --> 01:34:12.342
You were born at a time
when the world is full of corrupt men.

01:34:14.502 --> 01:34:16.462
Villains will always be after you.

01:34:18.782 --> 01:34:23.422
You are not destined to obey them
or to kneel at their feet someday.

01:34:28.702 --> 01:34:29.782
We are Turks, son.

01:34:31.742 --> 01:34:33.742
We are the brave fighters of the steppe.

01:34:36.582 --> 01:34:37.982
Finding without losing,

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:42.662
taking without deserving,

01:34:44.222 --> 01:34:46.142
dying without fighting is forbidden to us.

01:35:33.502 --> 01:35:36.342
In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.

01:35:37.062 --> 01:35:38.862
Have we not expanded thee thy breast?

01:35:39.662 --> 01:35:41.822
And removed from thee thy burden,

01:35:43.102 --> 01:35:48.422
which weighed down thy back?

01:35:50.182 --> 01:35:52.062
And exalted for thee thy mention?

01:35:54.182 --> 01:35:57.062
So, verily, with every difficulty,
there is relief.

01:35:58.742 --> 01:36:02.502
Yes. Verily, with every difficulty
there is relief.

01:36:03.622 --> 01:36:06.862
Therefore, when thou art free,
still labor hard.

01:36:08.502 --> 01:36:12.662
And to thy Lord...
turn thy attention.

01:36:34.302 --> 01:36:36.622
In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.

01:36:38.902 --> 01:36:41.702
Verily we have granted thee
a manifest victory.

01:36:42.662 --> 01:36:46.502
That God may forgive thee thy faults
of the past and those to follow.

01:36:46.982 --> 01:36:50.862
Fulfil his favor to thee
and guide thee on the straight path.

01:36:52.542 --> 01:36:56.382
And that God may help thee
with powerful help.

01:36:58.622 --> 01:37:01.062
It is he who placed tranquility
into the hearts of the believers

01:37:01.462 --> 01:37:04.182
that they may add faith to their faith.

01:37:06.182 --> 01:37:09.102
For to God belong the forces
of the heavens and the earth.

01:37:10.062 --> 01:37:14.542
And God is...
full of knowledge and wisdom.

01:37:15.902 --> 01:37:18.462
That he may admit the men and women
who believe...

01:37:19.382 --> 01:37:21.502
to gardens beneath which rivers flow

01:37:21.942 --> 01:37:25.142
to dwell therein for aye

01:37:26.342 --> 01:37:28.822
and remove their ills from them.

01:37:29.942 --> 01:37:33.342
And that is, in the sight of God,
the highest achievement.

01:37:33.982 --> 01:37:37.262
And that he may punish the hypocrites,

01:37:37.782 --> 01:37:40.302
men and women,

01:37:40.982 --> 01:37:43.222
and the polytheist men and women,

01:37:43.822 --> 01:37:46.862
who hold an evil opinion of God.

01:37:48.542 --> 01:37:50.942
On them is a round of evil.

01:37:52.062 --> 01:37:55.622
The wrath of God is on them.
He has cursed them

01:37:56.662 --> 01:37:59.262
and prepared hell for them.

01:38:00.222 --> 01:38:02.182
And evil is it as a destination.

01:38:03.222 --> 01:38:05.822
For to God belong the forces
of the heavens and the earth.

01:38:06.662 --> 01:38:07.942
And God is exalted in power.

01:38:08.702 --> 01:38:10.422
And full of wisdom.

01:38:10.822 --> 01:38:13.382
Undoubtedly,
God is omniscient, all aware.

01:38:27.662 --> 01:38:28.662
<i>God!</i>

01:38:47.622 --> 01:38:49.942
Undoubtedly,
God is omniscient, all aware.

01:40:09.342 --> 01:40:11.342
May God heal you soon.

01:40:12.782 --> 01:40:13.742
Amen.

01:40:14.862 --> 01:40:17.342
You will be better by the time
your mother returns, Gündüz.

01:40:51.942 --> 01:40:53.022
Give me your blessing.

01:41:00.702 --> 01:41:01.822
I give you my blessing.

01:41:03.742 --> 01:41:04.702
My son.

01:41:14.022 --> 01:41:16.302
May God keep you from envious eyes,

01:41:17.742 --> 01:41:18.902
evil tongues...

01:41:20.822 --> 01:41:22.702
and sharp swords.

01:41:23.742 --> 01:41:25.102
Amen.

01:41:27.982 --> 01:41:29.822
Return quickly to me, God willing.

01:42:29.302 --> 01:42:32.942
Thanks to the powerful women
of the Kayi and Cavdar tribes,

01:42:33.702 --> 01:42:36.662
to these gold coins
I will today add 1,000 more.

01:42:39.822 --> 01:42:42.582
Do you think you'll be
able to spend that gold?

01:42:43.302 --> 01:42:46.822
I have known many people
that would do anything for gold,

01:42:47.302 --> 01:42:50.422
who died the moment they got their wish,
without touching a single coin.

01:42:55.822 --> 01:42:58.822
You will choke to death
on those gold coins.

01:43:01.342 --> 01:43:06.582
Francisco will live like a king
on Ertuğrul Bey's gold.

01:43:09.622 --> 01:43:12.262
-But you--
-Do you really think

01:43:12.462 --> 01:43:14.542
you will walk away
from Ertuğrul Bey alive?

01:43:16.982 --> 01:43:18.662
I am sure about it.

01:43:19.422 --> 01:43:23.142
Because I know that
a dead man cannot hurt a living one.

01:43:26.982 --> 01:43:30.942
Ertuğrul is walking into a trap
he will not get out of alive.

01:43:34.462 --> 01:43:35.582
Stupid Turk.

01:43:37.262 --> 01:43:42.582
He believes I'll let you and he go
once I get my hands on the gold.

01:43:44.542 --> 01:43:45.622
But...

01:43:46.742 --> 01:43:50.662
each of you will die
while gazing into each other's eyes.

01:44:30.582 --> 01:44:35.022
<i>I swear on my God,</i>
<i>my banner and my sword.</i>

01:44:36.302 --> 01:44:38.942
<i>Thank God, I am on a holy duty.</i>

01:44:40.022 --> 01:44:43.622
<i>If I turn back from this path I have taken</i>
<i>for my forefather Oguz's great generation,</i>

01:44:44.222 --> 01:44:47.222
<i>may I be slain by my own sword,</i>
<i>like wheat in the field.</i>

01:44:48.182 --> 01:44:51.382
<i>May the blue sky tear,</i>
<i>may the brave ground sink.</i>

01:44:52.262 --> 01:44:56.702
<i>May my forefather Oguz,</i>
<i>my blessed tribe, sue me in the next life.</i>

01:44:57.582 --> 01:45:00.742
<i>On this path I have taken,</i>
<i>may Hizir accompany me</i>

01:45:01.422 --> 01:45:03.102
<i>and may Ali be by my side.</i>

01:45:03.822 --> 01:45:06.702
<i>May the journey be ours,</i>
<i>and the victory God's.</i>

01:45:24.702 --> 01:45:27.902
Bey, I questioned everyone in the bazaar,
as per your orders.

01:45:28.182 --> 01:45:31.022
But no one could answer my questions.

01:45:31.742 --> 01:45:32.982
Nobody knows anything.

01:45:36.902 --> 01:45:38.062
Go back to the tribe, Kutluca.

01:45:39.862 --> 01:45:40.982
Yes, Bey.

01:45:43.622 --> 01:45:47.302
<i>My God, I call on you</i>
<i>with the prayers of Ali.</i>

01:45:47.942 --> 01:45:53.302
<i>You are the greatest, you are omnipotent,</i>
<i>and you oppress all kinds of evil.</i>

01:45:53.982 --> 01:45:56.342
<i>Save us from this trouble, God.</i>

01:46:18.422 --> 01:46:19.382
Bey...

01:46:20.382 --> 01:46:23.102
I heard about what happened.
I'm very sorry.

01:46:23.862 --> 01:46:26.342
I have prayed to our saints for them.

01:46:27.662 --> 01:46:28.622
Thank you, Hatun.

01:46:29.862 --> 01:46:33.942
Even though both tribes are suffering,
I saw that the women came to work.

01:46:34.942 --> 01:46:38.702
Ertuğrul Bey is the most determined man
I have ever seen. He never gives up.

01:46:39.222 --> 01:46:41.222
I understood this
the first day he came here.

01:46:41.942 --> 01:46:43.622
-Thank you.
-Bey!

01:46:46.862 --> 01:46:48.542
I have to tell you something.

01:46:49.742 --> 01:46:51.822
What is it, woman? Speak.

01:46:55.062 --> 01:46:57.382
I think I know who kidnapped them.

01:46:58.782 --> 01:46:59.742
Who?

01:47:01.222 --> 01:47:04.182
There is a Catalan warrior
who goes by the name Francisco.

01:47:05.182 --> 01:47:09.142
He doesn't come to the bazaar very often
as he and Simon are sworn enemies.

01:47:09.662 --> 01:47:12.102
What does he have to do with
the kidnapping of our women?

01:47:14.382 --> 01:47:15.822
Spit it out, woman!

01:47:16.982 --> 01:47:20.902
The day the rug house launched,
I met Francisco.

01:47:21.142 --> 01:47:24.262
He asked me lots of questions
about Halime and Aslıhan Hatun.

01:47:24.582 --> 01:47:26.462
I got scared and came back to my stall.

01:47:27.062 --> 01:47:29.862
Where can I find him? Tell me!

01:47:30.462 --> 01:47:32.862
One of his bandits
sometimes comes to my shop.

01:47:34.342 --> 01:47:37.142
I overheard him saying they have
a camp out at Aya Nikolas rocks.

01:47:38.142 --> 01:47:41.982
But Bey, you didn't hear
this from me, right?

01:48:15.262 --> 01:48:17.182
Hey, Aliyar. What's the rush?

01:48:17.662 --> 01:48:21.142
-Bandits have kidnapped our women.
-What?

01:48:21.462 --> 01:48:24.302
Aslıhan and Halime Sultan were kidnapped,
but I've discovered where they are.

01:48:24.902 --> 01:48:26.422
We have to go there now, brother.

01:48:26.782 --> 01:48:30.342
Ertuğrul went there alone
to pay the ransom and save the women.

01:48:30.862 --> 01:48:33.582
Then we should tell Batuhan
to get the Alps ready.

01:48:33.662 --> 01:48:35.222
There's no time, brother!

01:48:35.742 --> 01:48:37.302
We'll go together then. Come on.

01:49:18.008 --> 01:49:21.528
<i>Real mastery is being able to stare</i>
<i>your enemy in the eye</i>

01:49:21.848 --> 01:49:24.888
<i>while resisting the urge to draw</i>
<i>your sword until the moment is right.</i>

01:49:25.568 --> 01:49:29.288
<i>There is a proper time for everything.</i>

01:49:30.328 --> 01:49:33.608
<i>It is the enemy who renders you brave.</i>

01:49:44.288 --> 01:49:45.248
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:49:49.408 --> 01:49:50.288
You came.

01:49:51.768 --> 01:49:52.968
I said I would.

01:49:53.448 --> 01:49:54.328
And the gold?

01:49:58.088 --> 01:49:58.928
Come with me.

01:51:30.128 --> 01:51:31.288
Leave the horse here.

01:52:01.928 --> 01:52:02.848
They're coming.

01:52:25.448 --> 01:52:26.648
Not now, wait.

01:52:28.488 --> 01:52:29.328
Bring them.

01:53:49.488 --> 01:53:50.448
Ertuğrul

01:54:12.968 --> 01:54:15.608
First, let Halime and Aslıhan Sultan go.

01:54:18.288 --> 01:54:19.808
Why the hurry, Ertuğrul Bey?

01:54:22.408 --> 01:54:26.488
Francisco would like you
to be together, not to leave.

01:54:30.088 --> 01:54:33.248
Either in this world, or the next.

01:55:02.248 --> 01:55:03.208
Kill them.

01:56:31.008 --> 01:56:32.368
I'm here, Ertuğrul!

01:56:35.008 --> 01:56:36.208
Ertuğrul

01:56:43.688 --> 01:56:45.008
For God!

01:57:03.208 --> 01:57:04.168
Come on!

01:58:15.248 --> 01:58:18.048
I told you I'd be your death.

01:58:18.888 --> 01:58:21.928
Take it! Take it!

01:58:25.728 --> 01:58:29.768
Eat them till they choke you,
eat the coins for which you killed my son!

01:58:30.168 --> 01:58:32.048
Halime. Halime!

01:58:37.248 --> 01:58:39.528
-Halime.
-Ertuğrul

01:58:40.528 --> 01:58:43.888
Is my Gündüz alive? Does our son live?

01:58:44.248 --> 01:58:47.088
He's alive. He'll get better
once he sees you.

01:58:47.488 --> 01:58:49.408
Thank God!

01:58:52.408 --> 01:58:53.808
Ertuğrul.

01:58:55.448 --> 01:58:57.848
Ertuğrul., let's go home, come on.

01:58:58.208 --> 01:59:00.448
Let's go. Let's go.

01:59:08.648 --> 01:59:12.368
Thank God for giving me
two brave brothers.

01:59:13.728 --> 01:59:15.328
This has been hard on you, Halime Sultan.

01:59:16.248 --> 01:59:18.848
-I'll get the horses.
-Thank you.

01:59:22.488 --> 01:59:24.848
If it hadn't been for you,
things could have been much worse.

01:59:25.328 --> 01:59:29.968
May God keep us united,
and our tribes protected from suffering.

01:59:31.128 --> 01:59:32.768
Amen, thank you.

01:59:46.368 --> 01:59:48.688
Nothing compares to fighting
side by side with a brave man.

01:59:49.368 --> 01:59:50.568
This is an honorable day.

01:59:51.448 --> 01:59:53.848
Thank you, Ural Bey. Thank you.

02:00:17.368 --> 02:00:20.088
-Maria, honey.
-Did you bring it?

02:00:21.408 --> 02:00:22.648
Of course.

02:00:26.448 --> 02:00:29.208
-How is it?
-Very nice.

02:00:30.648 --> 02:00:32.488
I've never smelled
such a beautiful fragrance.

02:00:34.648 --> 02:00:36.488
I'm sure Turgut will love it too.

02:00:37.928 --> 02:00:39.848
You're blushing now.

02:00:40.408 --> 02:00:42.488
Did somebody confess
her feelings last night?

02:00:43.528 --> 02:00:45.368
No reason to be embarrassed, sweetie.

02:00:45.768 --> 02:00:50.208
That scent will turn Turgut into a beast
and you into a Greek goddess.

02:00:59.848 --> 02:01:01.688
I can see your true colors now, Amanda.

02:01:15.048 --> 02:01:16.648
Now we can start the war.

02:01:41.808 --> 02:01:43.328
People are coming.

02:01:43.728 --> 02:01:44.688
Look!

02:01:47.328 --> 02:01:48.248
Look!

02:01:54.928 --> 02:01:56.648
Ertuğrul Bey is coming. Thank god!

02:01:56.968 --> 02:01:58.688
Thank god he's coming.

02:01:59.168 --> 02:02:03.328
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

02:02:15.968 --> 02:02:20.048
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

02:02:37.128 --> 02:02:38.008
Gündüz.

02:02:46.768 --> 02:02:48.008
Aslıhan!

02:02:53.928 --> 02:02:54.928
Father...

02:03:15.608 --> 02:03:16.568
Gündüz...

02:03:17.528 --> 02:03:18.968
-Halime!
-Gündüz...

02:03:20.408 --> 02:03:21.368
Mother...

02:03:22.768 --> 02:03:24.608
How is my son's condition, Artuk Bey?

02:03:34.368 --> 02:03:37.048
My sweet girl... Don't lose hope.

02:03:38.248 --> 02:03:42.968
Gündüz! I can't take it,
don't do this to me, son.

02:03:43.368 --> 02:03:45.848
Come back to me.

02:03:46.608 --> 02:03:49.728
I beg you, open your eyes.

02:03:51.048 --> 02:03:53.448
I owe you her life, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:03:55.168 --> 02:03:56.768
God bless you.

02:03:57.928 --> 02:04:02.208
I couldn't have done it
if it hadn't been for Aliyar and Ural Bey.

02:04:19.328 --> 02:04:20.608
My brother is innocent, Father.

02:04:21.288 --> 02:04:24.848
We brought the bandits into line.
We killed them all.

02:04:29.048 --> 02:04:31.088
Your sons did you proud, Father.

02:04:32.128 --> 02:04:34.408
We managed to unite.

02:04:51.368 --> 02:04:52.968
Gündüz!

02:04:53.608 --> 02:04:57.288
Open your eyes, my darling, I beg you.

02:04:59.528 --> 02:05:03.608
Don't leave us.
Don't do this to me, Gündüz!

02:05:04.688 --> 02:05:09.688
Ertuğrul! Ertuğrul, say something.
Please, anything.

02:05:10.368 --> 02:05:13.328
Tell me Gündüz will be well again.

02:05:14.048 --> 02:05:17.248
Tell me that our son will live,
tell me something, Ertuğrul!

02:05:19.488 --> 02:05:22.728
Tell me nothing is going to happen
to our son, Ertuğrul.

02:05:23.008 --> 02:05:24.088
I can't take this.

02:05:25.528 --> 02:05:27.648
I can't bear it, Ertuğrul.

02:05:28.408 --> 02:05:30.048
Please, say something.

02:05:32.248 --> 02:05:34.288
I beg you, say something, Ertuğrul!

02:05:35.368 --> 02:05:37.128
I can't live like this.

02:05:38.288 --> 02:05:40.448
Please, say something.

02:05:52.288 --> 02:05:53.128
Mother.

02:05:57.088 --> 02:05:58.048
Son?

02:05:59.168 --> 02:06:01.808
My darling? Gündüz!

02:06:04.128 --> 02:06:05.488
Gündüz!

02:06:13.488 --> 02:06:17.328
Son, I'm here, dear.

02:06:18.208 --> 02:06:21.168
My son. Are you really awake?

02:06:23.128 --> 02:06:26.688
Dad, when will you get me a real sword?

02:06:41.968 --> 02:06:47.248
My son! I was so scared, darling!

02:06:50.128 --> 02:06:53.488
When the time is right, son.
When the time is right.

02:06:57.408 --> 02:06:59.808
Thank heavens.

02:07:02.928 --> 02:07:04.528
Thank God.

02:07:05.568 --> 02:07:09.768
Thank god for sparing my grandson.

02:07:10.488 --> 02:07:11.848
Thank God.

02:07:13.408 --> 02:07:14.368
Ertuğrul.

02:07:26.488 --> 02:07:27.408
Sir...

02:07:37.888 --> 02:07:39.088
Innkeeper Simon is here.

02:07:39.928 --> 02:07:43.368
He has a tied-up woman with him.
He wants to see you.

02:07:51.488 --> 02:07:53.768
The man you went to meet in Konya...

02:07:54.768 --> 02:07:55.608
Who was it?

02:07:57.648 --> 02:07:59.928
Father, I'll tell you everything.

02:08:00.688 --> 02:08:03.248
But now is not the time.

02:08:03.968 --> 02:08:06.568
I asked you something.
Give me a name.

02:08:08.968 --> 02:08:10.488
Emir Sadettin Köpek.

02:08:13.928 --> 02:08:14.888
Father...

02:08:15.448 --> 02:08:18.288
If you still think I was behind this,

02:08:19.088 --> 02:08:22.368
you can ask the emir
whether or not if I was with him.

02:08:23.808 --> 02:08:27.888
I bring good news from him.

02:08:37.368 --> 02:08:38.688
How is Gündüz, sir?

02:08:40.968 --> 02:08:43.088
He'll recover, God willing.

02:08:44.208 --> 02:08:45.528
He has opened his eyes, Candar Bey.

02:08:53.368 --> 02:08:56.528
Abdurrahman told me Simon came
to see me with a tied-up woman.

02:09:00.328 --> 02:09:02.568
Let's see what he has to say.

02:09:35.888 --> 02:09:38.528
I come in peace, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:09:39.448 --> 02:09:43.648
I've found out who made the attempt
on your family's lives and on my market.

02:09:52.928 --> 02:09:55.048
I'm handing her over to you.
