00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 64 will start after 12:52 min.

12:52.074 --> 12:56.954
Sir, with your permission,
this man wants to see you.

12:57.674 --> 13:00.954
His name is Philip.
He says he works with the innkeeper Simon.

13:02.914 --> 13:03.994
You may speak, Philip.

13:15.674 --> 13:21.274
Ertuğrul Bey, I bring you
Master Simon's regards.

13:23.674 --> 13:27.034
Received. So, what's wrong?

13:32.434 --> 13:35.154
On the way to Constantinople,
the Alps that were escorting your rugs...

13:40.194 --> 13:41.154
they were attacked.

13:41.634 --> 13:43.514
What, did he say attacked?

13:46.874 --> 13:48.594
No!

13:50.074 --> 13:51.394
Unbelievable.

13:54.074 --> 13:55.194
How is that possible?

14:00.114 --> 14:01.634
We must take revenge.

14:03.594 --> 14:06.634
Silence! Can't you see Bey is talking?

14:13.674 --> 14:16.394
Unfortunately, all your Alps were killed.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.434
Except their commander, Turgut.

14:34.194 --> 14:36.514
Master Simon sends his condolences.

14:40.354 --> 14:41.234
You...

14:42.634 --> 14:45.714
-What are you talking about?
-Bamsi!

14:49.874 --> 14:50.994
Bamsi.

15:00.554 --> 15:01.914
Where is Turgut?

15:02.634 --> 15:06.114
At the inn, sir. They're trying to
keep him alive until you arrive.

15:07.594 --> 15:09.594
Only he knows who did it.

15:11.674 --> 15:13.554
It'd be in your interest to go there.

15:29.194 --> 15:33.314
Sir, give me the order
to prepare to depart.

15:33.754 --> 15:35.994
Ishak, you stay here.

15:36.514 --> 15:38.274
-Ertuğrul Bey.
-Abdurrahman!

15:38.434 --> 15:40.834
-Sir.
-Tell Artuk Bey...

15:41.634 --> 15:42.834
he comes to the inn with me.

15:43.674 --> 15:46.474
-Yes, sir.
-Son, what's going on?

15:47.074 --> 15:48.474
We'll see, Mother.

15:50.354 --> 15:52.074
You deal with the families
of the dead Alps.

15:53.714 --> 15:55.034
Don't leave them alone.

15:57.594 --> 15:58.954
Let them know

15:59.834 --> 16:02.914
that the blood of our martyrs
will be avenged.

16:13.034 --> 16:15.994
Bamsi. Let's go.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.474
Yes, sir.

16:23.794 --> 16:28.714
First Doğan Alp,
and now Turgut Alp as well, huh?

16:30.114 --> 16:32.154
Let's see how this turns out.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.314
Banu Çiçek!

16:43.514 --> 16:44.594
Listen...

16:45.434 --> 16:47.634
Everybody is already exhausted.

16:48.434 --> 16:52.874
Do not open that damn mouth of yours
and rub salt into their wounds.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.634
Got it?

17:22.314 --> 17:23.514
One day...

17:24.234 --> 17:27.194
-I will either kill my own blood, or--
-Father.

17:28.194 --> 17:29.674
Don't talk like that.

17:30.514 --> 17:32.114
There's no other way, son.

17:37.234 --> 17:40.394
You'll invite Ertuğrul, personally.

17:43.074 --> 17:44.594
Have you thought this through, Father?

17:46.154 --> 17:51.634
Summoning Ertuğrul Bey and his family
will only fan the flames.

17:52.274 --> 17:54.394
You said that Ertuğrul is a wise man.

17:56.314 --> 17:59.274
But if he realizes that my brother
was the culprit...

18:00.354 --> 18:01.914
You know what happened at the market.

18:02.274 --> 18:06.474
That's why I'm inviting him,
so that he doesn't suspect Ural.

18:07.674 --> 18:13.114
And I'm sending you, my own blood,
to ensure he can't decline.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.154
Then what?

18:17.154 --> 18:18.754
Do you think he won't suspect?

18:19.274 --> 18:20.474
When he comes...

18:21.634 --> 18:25.634
we'll give them a feast.

18:26.274 --> 18:29.954
We'll tell them we heard what happened,
that we are sorry for them,

18:30.234 --> 18:32.474
and that we are here
if he needs our support.

18:33.394 --> 18:36.234
Also, that we're ready
to give him our men

18:36.514 --> 18:40.554
when he goes looking for the killers.

18:41.074 --> 18:45.834
Otherwise, either Ural,
or Ertuğrul will die.

18:47.514 --> 18:50.714
We cannot prevent this, son.

18:52.794 --> 18:54.154
Whatever the cost

18:55.034 --> 18:59.034
I can't allow my son to be killed,
despite his treachery.

19:00.554 --> 19:03.914
We'll convince Ertuğrul
and gain his trust.

19:05.514 --> 19:06.754
When Ertuğrul Bey

19:09.114 --> 19:11.274
learns that it was my brother...

19:12.794 --> 19:16.034
-He will want revenge.
-Then...

19:17.314 --> 19:21.234
we'll have to kill Ertuğrul Bey.

19:26.954 --> 19:31.034
It won't be easy, Father.
So many would have to die on both sides.

19:32.394 --> 19:36.714
The peace between our tribes
will be replaced with conflict.

19:39.874 --> 19:42.394
Aliyar, go now,

19:42.954 --> 19:48.274
and bring Ertuğrul Bey here at all costs.

19:51.994 --> 19:53.474
Off you go, my son.

20:05.594 --> 20:06.794
Guards!

20:10.194 --> 20:12.754
{\an8}HANLI MARKET

20:40.154 --> 20:44.474
I've done all I can.
Anything more will require a doctor.

20:45.514 --> 20:48.514
-Will he live?
-It won't be easy,

20:48.914 --> 20:51.274
there's no one here
to care of him properly.

20:55.234 --> 21:00.194
If Turgut survives to tell
Ertuğrul that it was Batuhan

21:00.594 --> 21:04.354
the tribes will fight,
which will work to our advantage.

21:06.154 --> 21:07.114
What if he dies?

21:13.954 --> 21:17.354
I'm not about to leave it
in the hands of the devil.

21:18.554 --> 21:23.154
Anton, make sure that Ertuğrul
receives Batuhan's knife today.

21:23.674 --> 21:25.834
Give this knife to two of your
most trusted men.

21:26.314 --> 21:28.234
Have them wait for Ertuğrul
at the Blind Spring.

21:29.634 --> 21:31.274
When Ertuğrul comes,

21:32.314 --> 21:34.674
have them tell him
that this knife belongs to Batuhan.

21:36.354 --> 21:37.754
Yes, Master Simon.

21:37.994 --> 21:41.194
Neither Ertuğrul nor Ural can know
we were involved in this.

21:43.074 --> 21:44.634
-Make haste.
-Yes, sir.

21:48.554 --> 21:52.354
And I shall have Ural and Ricardo
sit at the table they knocked down.

22:50.874 --> 22:55.394
Filthy Turk! Not only did I lose
two of my best men...

22:56.754 --> 22:58.114
I also lost 300 gold coins.

22:59.514 --> 23:02.194
You are at fault
for trusting Ertuğrul Bey, Ricardo.

23:03.194 --> 23:05.874
And you paid for it. That's all.

23:06.274 --> 23:08.954
Ural Bey, don't push me.

23:10.354 --> 23:12.834
My fellow Beys, stop arguing.

23:13.794 --> 23:16.514
What's done is done.
Let us look forward.

23:17.074 --> 23:23.514
Turgut might survive
and we can find out who did this.

23:25.394 --> 23:26.554
Right, Ural Bey?

23:27.834 --> 23:29.954
Whether he speaks or not
is of no concern to me.

23:30.754 --> 23:32.354
All I care about is business.

23:36.474 --> 23:39.234
Ertuğrul Bey, you promised

23:39.514 --> 23:42.234
you'd make sure my rugs
arrived at Constantinople safely.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.834
What happened? Tell me.

23:50.994 --> 23:55.434
One of my men is hurt.
I must see him, we'll talk later.

23:57.194 --> 23:59.954
Listen to me, Turk!
You owe me 300 gold coins.

24:00.114 --> 24:02.074
Or I'll make you pay for it.

24:24.434 --> 24:27.394
I'm Ertuğrul, the Bey of Kayi Tribe,
son of Suleyman Shah.

24:28.354 --> 24:30.394
I keep my promises.

24:39.794 --> 24:41.434
You'll get your gold back.

24:55.634 --> 24:57.754
Ertuğrul Bey, I heard what happened.

24:58.594 --> 25:02.754
You may be my rival
in the marketplace,

25:03.154 --> 25:04.994
but I'm sorry for your loss.

25:06.674 --> 25:10.034
You can be sure that I'll do
what I can for you, Ertuğrul Bey.

25:13.474 --> 25:15.954
I shall not forget this favor,
Simon Efendi.

25:18.514 --> 25:19.594
Where is my alp?

25:19.834 --> 25:22.554
My sister Maria is taking care of him.
Don't worry.

25:23.234 --> 25:26.354
Philip, escort Ertuğrul Bey
to Turgut Alp's quarters.

25:26.914 --> 25:29.074
I'll visit you after
I put my affairs in order.

25:29.434 --> 25:30.514
Let's go.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.914
That was the price
of your cunning, Ricardo.

25:54.594 --> 25:58.274
If we don't talk soon,
it's going to cost us dearly.

25:59.794 --> 26:02.594
Even if doomsday is upon us,
business continues.

26:03.314 --> 26:05.554
Gold coins still flow in.

26:06.234 --> 26:09.194
It's the way the world turns, right, Ural?

26:40.194 --> 26:44.034
Turgut, brother!
How could they do this to you?

27:00.194 --> 27:02.674
-Excuse me, I'm the doctor.
-Of course.

27:11.034 --> 27:13.394
Sword cuts in his arms and back.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.114
But the worst one is in his abdomen.

27:19.394 --> 27:22.674
There's no damage to his vital organs,
but he has lost a lot of blood.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.714
I was a nurse
during the crusade in Palestine.

27:29.514 --> 27:31.674
I'd like to help if I can.

27:34.794 --> 27:36.394
Bring me more clean cloth.

27:37.914 --> 27:39.274
Get some hot water as well.

27:39.434 --> 27:42.194
Get a fire going quickly
so that we can burn his wound.

27:48.274 --> 27:51.834
-Who found him?
-I did, Ertuğrul Bey.

27:52.754 --> 27:56.034
-Where did you find him?
-Near Karacahisar Keep.

27:56.354 --> 27:58.634
What were you doing there, woman?

28:01.874 --> 28:03.834
We had collections to fetch from Tekfur.

28:04.914 --> 28:06.874
As I said, I saw them on the road.

28:09.074 --> 28:10.674
Are you sure my other Alps were dead?

28:12.194 --> 28:14.034
As I said, I was a nurse.

28:14.794 --> 28:17.274
I can tell the dead
from the living at least.

28:17.874 --> 28:21.914
She's right, sir.
Her actions were justifiable.

28:28.914 --> 28:30.154
Where are my other Alps?

28:30.754 --> 28:33.914
My brother Simon had them brought in
to protect them from animals.

28:36.754 --> 28:38.594
They are outside the inn, on a cart.

28:44.594 --> 28:45.914
I'm very sorry for your loss.

29:29.274 --> 29:31.114
You can go, sir.
I can handle it from here.

29:42.234 --> 29:43.474
Give me the cloth, dear.

29:44.714 --> 29:46.194
Your goods were burned.

29:47.314 --> 29:49.074
Will you go back to Venice empty handed?

29:50.314 --> 29:54.074
Ural Bey's offer is still on,
three gold coins per rug.

29:55.394 --> 29:59.714
Also, to ensure they arrive
in Constantinople safe and sound,

29:59.874 --> 30:02.754
my Alps and Ural Bey's men
will escort the caravan.

30:04.474 --> 30:05.674
You'll be in safe hands.

30:06.954 --> 30:09.234
What about the money I gave to Ertuğrul?

30:09.914 --> 30:13.354
I'll deal with it.
I can make the collection for you.

30:13.914 --> 30:15.594
If you'd like me to, that is.

30:17.994 --> 30:19.314
I'm out of options.

30:19.834 --> 30:22.314
The ship is setting sail
to Venice in three days.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.154
We must get going, now.

30:25.434 --> 30:27.154
Are you in, Ural Bey?

30:29.274 --> 30:31.154
-Yes.
-Good.

30:32.434 --> 30:37.674
With that matter dealt with, we can now
talk about our deal of 1,500 rugs.

30:39.834 --> 30:41.154
Did you say 1,500?

30:42.394 --> 30:47.274
Ricardo wants 1,500 rugs by spring.

30:47.994 --> 30:49.754
He trusted me with it.

30:50.434 --> 30:54.514
I'll carry the ball in Ricardo's stead.
I'll also take my cut.

30:55.914 --> 30:57.754
If you are okay with it,

30:58.994 --> 31:01.114
we can talk about it more later.

31:05.714 --> 31:08.394
At last, we'll make profit from it all.

31:54.714 --> 31:55.634
Bey...

31:56.554 --> 31:58.834
Sir, my heart can't take it anymore.

32:02.354 --> 32:05.914
We trained these men with Turgut.

32:07.834 --> 32:13.234
We taught them how to hold a sword,
to use a bow, to ride a horse.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.354
Sir,

32:17.994 --> 32:21.954
they were loved by their families.

32:25.754 --> 32:27.434
Now they rest here.

32:29.274 --> 32:31.554
And Turgut is fighting for his life.

32:32.234 --> 32:34.794
We'll find
whoever pulled this dirty trick on us.

32:35.594 --> 32:39.714
We'll give them
the most terrible of deaths.

32:43.074 --> 32:45.674
Whoever did this can't be human,
Ertuğrul Bey.

32:48.314 --> 32:52.314
They're so low
that they'd murder men for rugs.

32:53.194 --> 32:56.274
It's my duty as well as yours to make
sure they pay for what they've done.

32:58.114 --> 32:59.994
They've blackened
the reputation of my marketplace.

33:00.794 --> 33:02.434
What else do you know, Simon?

33:02.874 --> 33:05.074
According to Maria, they came in numbers.

33:05.834 --> 33:07.874
Many of their men died too.

33:08.434 --> 33:10.394
She said it was a bloodbath.

33:10.914 --> 33:14.554
Who are they? Do you know anything else?

33:16.114 --> 33:20.434
-Where are the bodies of the murderers?
-They didn't leave the bodies behind.

33:21.074 --> 33:24.874
They took their men with them,
and burned the rugs.

33:27.194 --> 33:29.794
-Then they are not thieves.
-Right.

33:31.514 --> 33:34.194
It seems somebody
holds a grudge against you.

33:42.834 --> 33:46.754
Don't be suspicious of Ural,
he was in his tent last night.

33:47.594 --> 33:50.474
His brother Aliyar will tell you the same.

33:51.834 --> 33:55.554
He's not so low as to do something
of this caliber.

33:56.234 --> 33:58.394
And even if he did,

33:58.554 --> 34:02.194
make no mistake, his father Candar Bey
would kill him before you could.

34:16.994 --> 34:21.114
That is Ertuğrul,
and beside him is Bamsi Alp.

34:25.394 --> 34:27.634
What about that
inauspicious looking merchant?

34:28.154 --> 34:32.074
That'd be Simon Efendi.
The owner of the market and the inn.

34:32.594 --> 34:35.874
You may go. I can handle the rest.

35:24.314 --> 35:27.834
-How is he, Artuk Bey?
-Maria looked after Turgut well.

35:31.274 --> 35:35.874
If she hadn't acted when she did,
he'd have died a long ago.

35:36.554 --> 35:39.154
The rest is up to our God.

35:39.634 --> 35:42.834
All I know is that we can't take him
back to our tent just yet.

35:43.794 --> 35:48.034
If we moved him an inch
it'd mean his death.

35:52.634 --> 35:54.794
I'll take care of him, Ertuğrul Bey.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.714
I'll be sure to treat him
as if he was my own brother.

36:33.154 --> 36:35.034
Bamsi, stay with Turgut.

36:36.354 --> 36:39.354
We can't trust anyone here.
Not that woman, not the guards.

36:40.234 --> 36:41.554
Sure thing, sir.

36:42.874 --> 36:45.714
What if John the Baptist
is at the inn, sir?

36:47.034 --> 36:50.514
If John the Baptist is Simon,
he'll want to gain our trust.

36:51.234 --> 36:52.914
It means he must doubt me as well.

36:53.754 --> 36:58.674
If I leave Turgut here
it'll make him think that I trust him.

37:03.194 --> 37:04.874
We'll keep playing this game

37:04.994 --> 37:07.274
until one of us finds out
who the other really is.

37:08.314 --> 37:12.234
What about those who attacked
our horses?

37:13.514 --> 37:15.034
We'll go after them, Bamsi.

37:16.794 --> 37:19.194
You'll go after the slaver Tristan.

37:20.234 --> 37:22.474
He'll take us
to John the Baptist for sure.

37:33.314 --> 37:35.154
Bamsi Alp will stay with Turgut.

37:36.074 --> 37:38.794
I'd like to pay you for the room
and your services.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.474
There's no need.

37:42.074 --> 37:44.354
I'm equally responsible
for what you've been through.

37:44.954 --> 37:48.274
Turgut Alp is an honored guest of mine,
as well as Maria's.

37:48.794 --> 37:51.354
Just like Bamsi Alp.

37:55.034 --> 37:56.034
Don't worry.

37:58.194 --> 37:59.114
So be it.

38:25.154 --> 38:28.074
Bamsi, Turgut is in your hands.

38:28.794 --> 38:30.994
Yes, sir. Yes.

39:26.954 --> 39:29.234
Aykiz.

39:30.474 --> 39:31.714
Aykiz?

39:44.994 --> 39:45.994
Will he live?

39:52.434 --> 39:53.554
He will live.

39:55.234 --> 39:56.234
This Artuk man...

39:57.154 --> 39:58.954
He's the best doctor I've ever seen.

40:00.274 --> 40:03.874
Good. I want him to live, anyway.

40:05.554 --> 40:08.474
I must make sure Ertuğrul
is Aladdin's guard dog.

40:09.674 --> 40:13.034
I need Turgut to reveal
Ertuğrul's true colors.

40:13.514 --> 40:15.874
We must keep him here,
whatever the cost.

40:18.434 --> 40:21.154
You will offer yourself
to him if you must.

40:22.434 --> 40:26.434
Make sure he falls for you,
so that I get what I want.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.394
Don't worry, Master Simon.

40:35.154 --> 40:38.554
Philip, come with me. We must talk.

40:59.314 --> 41:00.994
Let's see who this Aykiz is.

41:10.994 --> 41:12.314
Brave Turk!

41:13.154 --> 41:15.474
Help me take off his clothes.

41:19.834 --> 41:21.754
Don't worry, I won't bite him.

41:24.714 --> 41:26.074
Repent, repent!

42:06.554 --> 42:08.794
-What do you want?
-Stop!

42:08.874 --> 42:13.594
I didn't mean anything by it, sir.
A man came up to me and gave me gold.

42:13.954 --> 42:16.994
-What did he want?
-He said, "Tell Ertuğrul Bey

42:17.074 --> 42:20.074
that if he wants to find out the truth,
he should go to Blind Spring."

42:29.034 --> 42:30.234
Go.

42:31.834 --> 42:33.114
Thank you, sir.

42:46.514 --> 42:50.794
What is this pus festering in every line
and wrinkle of this market?

42:51.954 --> 42:56.314
-You are obviously being led into a trap.
-They don't want to kill me,

42:56.874 --> 42:59.714
they want to get me
to confront those who killed my Alps.

43:00.074 --> 43:01.114
What will you do?

43:04.234 --> 43:07.034
If I want to find out the truth,
I have to go.

43:23.994 --> 43:25.274
Sir, what happened?

43:34.834 --> 43:37.914
Kutluca, we can't allow Ertuğrul
to find out the truth.

43:40.354 --> 43:44.354
We can't have our tribes
fighting each other.

43:47.554 --> 43:48.914
Listen to me.

43:57.634 --> 43:59.874
Are you sure Turgut didn't see you?

44:00.354 --> 44:04.274
It was dark, sir. And my face was covered.
He couldn't possibly have seen me.

44:04.554 --> 44:07.474
Good. We can't leave this to chance.

44:07.994 --> 44:12.274
We can't allow Turgut to live.
He can't leave that inn alive.

44:13.634 --> 44:15.274
There is a problem, sir.

44:17.114 --> 44:18.314
What?

44:19.514 --> 44:24.954
My knife, sir. I can't find my knife.
I must've dropped it during the attack.

44:25.634 --> 44:27.634
What did you say, Batuhan?

44:29.234 --> 44:32.834
If Ertuğrul finds it,
he will hunt you down. You fool!

44:32.994 --> 44:36.034
-Go back and look for it.
-I did, sir, but it wasn't there.

44:36.554 --> 44:39.754
-I must've dropped it somewhere else.
-Let's hope you're right, Batuhan.

44:40.754 --> 44:42.354
Let's hope you're right.

45:00.274 --> 45:04.474
Take our martyrs back to the tent,
Artuk Bey. Prepare them for the funeral.

45:04.954 --> 45:07.754
-I'll catch up with you.
-Let me come with you, sir.

45:09.954 --> 45:12.994
I won't be alone, Artuk Bey.
I'll go with my Alps.

45:14.634 --> 45:16.594
May God be with you, sir.

45:37.994 --> 45:40.674
How is your Commander Turgut,
Ertuğrul Bey?

45:43.234 --> 45:45.274
He's pulling through somehow, Ural Bey.

45:46.314 --> 45:48.474
Artuk Bey's proficiency as a doctor
precedes him.

45:49.114 --> 45:51.594
All we can do is wish
him a fast recovery.

45:53.514 --> 45:56.794
-Thank you.
-But I'm warning you, Ertuğrul Bey.

45:57.674 --> 46:01.154
These lands are nothing like
the land we came from, the steppes.

46:02.234 --> 46:04.234
Earning our lives as merchants

46:05.354 --> 46:10.034
is not like hunting down men with swords.
I told you it wouldn't be easy.

46:10.674 --> 46:14.634
The men running this marketplace
are worse than the Mongolian assholes.

46:16.554 --> 46:18.314
Don't meddle in things
you don't understand.

46:19.954 --> 46:23.314
This market makes a man feel
like a fish out of water.

46:25.954 --> 46:29.994
Know your limits.

46:41.674 --> 46:45.914
Thank god we haven't had to kneel
for gold yet, Ural Bey.

46:47.394 --> 46:49.154
Looting is against our tradition as well.

46:51.194 --> 46:55.954
We may not be good merchants
such as yourself, but we will take...

46:57.434 --> 47:00.314
the heads of those looters,
whoever they might be.

47:04.074 --> 47:07.074
Beware, this land is also home to us.

47:09.114 --> 47:12.274
Nobody should labor under the illusion
that we are going anywhere.

47:31.114 --> 47:33.594
Ural, I brought the fragrance
Colpan Hatun asked for.

47:39.034 --> 47:41.474
You aren't jealous of my wife
by any chance, are you?

47:43.034 --> 47:45.114
My dear sir,
I know you have such a huge heart

47:45.674 --> 47:47.314
that we could both fit within it.

47:50.954 --> 47:54.874
My present looks good on you.

47:57.554 --> 47:59.954
Go to the inn some time. Talk to Maria.

48:00.434 --> 48:03.554
-And don't leave Turgut alone.
-Don't worry, sir.

49:05.365 --> 49:07.485
My son, who did this to you?

49:11.085 --> 49:12.845
How could they do this to you?

49:19.605 --> 49:20.845
My son!

49:38.445 --> 49:39.725
Dad?

49:40.085 --> 49:44.365
Let me see my dad! Dad!

49:45.125 --> 49:46.125
I want to see my dad!

49:49.085 --> 49:51.725
-Let me see my dad!
-Come here.

49:52.205 --> 49:54.645
Come here, son.

49:55.445 --> 49:58.365
Your dad wouldn't like you to
remember him like this.

49:58.565 --> 50:02.005
His blood is like holy water to me now,
Mother Hayme. Let me see him.

50:02.165 --> 50:05.405
All right. When the time comes, you will.

50:17.525 --> 50:19.005
My love!

50:21.845 --> 50:23.485
How could they do this to you?

50:24.765 --> 50:26.605
How?

50:31.645 --> 50:32.765
Come here.

50:34.325 --> 50:37.805
Avenge our sons, Halime Hatun.

50:37.885 --> 50:40.485
We can't let them trample on us
because we are weak and few.

50:40.725 --> 50:42.205
That's right, they must pay!

50:42.885 --> 50:45.405
We must avenge them!

50:46.205 --> 50:48.205
Let's make them pay!

50:48.365 --> 50:51.685
-We should avenge them!
-We should avenge them!

50:52.285 --> 50:54.805
We can't let them die for nothing!

50:59.685 --> 51:04.685
Ertuğrul Bey is already
hunting the ones responsible for this.

51:06.085 --> 51:12.485
You all know that Ertuğrul Bey
will not return empty handed.

51:13.645 --> 51:19.325
That lowly scum will choke
on the blood they have spilled.

51:21.845 --> 51:24.805
Brave sons and daughters of Kayi!

51:27.805 --> 51:29.325
Artuk Bey is right.

51:31.005 --> 51:35.325
Ertuğrul Bey has gone after
those who have made us suffer.

51:37.045 --> 51:39.885
Five of our sons have died.

51:41.805 --> 51:44.365
We'd forgotten this kind of pain.

51:45.325 --> 51:48.485
But it also means that

51:48.925 --> 51:52.445
we have reached the destination
Ertuğrul Bey promised us

51:52.845 --> 51:55.685
way before we settled here.

51:57.005 --> 52:02.485
That is the reason they are attacking us
like rabid dogs.

52:03.725 --> 52:04.885
Now,

52:05.925 --> 52:09.765
we must do what's right for our martyrs.

52:11.165 --> 52:15.725
We must grieve solemnly, befitting
of our Oguz ancestors, as we wait for him.

52:17.085 --> 52:19.365
Ertuğrul Bey keeps his promises.

52:21.005 --> 52:24.885
We shall grieve
until we avenge our brothers.

52:25.245 --> 52:29.725
Ertuğrul Bey wants the bodies
prepared for burial.

52:31.005 --> 52:34.805
He said he will make it to the funeral
come hell or high water.

52:35.525 --> 52:37.565
-Abdurrahman.
-Yes, Halime Sultan.

52:37.925 --> 52:40.005
Begin the preparations for burial.

52:40.685 --> 52:42.285
When Ertuğrul Bey returns

52:42.445 --> 52:47.245
we will see what scoundrel laid this trap,
and to what end.

52:48.205 --> 52:49.925
And then do what's necessary.

52:50.845 --> 52:52.005
As you wish, Halime Sultan.

53:11.165 --> 53:15.525
You represented your husband well
at this painful time.

53:16.285 --> 53:17.525
You dealt with the problem

53:19.165 --> 53:21.005
and soothed their pain.

53:23.365 --> 53:24.925
Still, my heart aches, Mother.

53:26.325 --> 53:27.565
I know.

53:28.565 --> 53:30.405
We are the women of this camp.

53:31.205 --> 53:34.965
Even when we grieve,
we must keep a smile on our faces.

53:35.845 --> 53:38.245
Our words must give them hope.

53:39.685 --> 53:41.245
Even if this camp burns to the ground

53:42.965 --> 53:45.285
the whole world will witness us
unleash our anger.

53:49.365 --> 53:50.325
Let's go.

53:52.925 --> 53:55.365
{\an8}THE VILLAGE OF ÇAVDAR

53:55.835 --> 53:59.075
Aslıhan Hatun, your late mother
established this carpet weaving house.

53:59.235 --> 54:03.275
You helped it prosper and grow famous,
how can you quit it now?

54:03.675 --> 54:06.955
Why did you leave it to Çolpan Hatun?
How could she know what we do?

54:07.715 --> 54:09.795
Don't leave us, we all support you.

54:10.155 --> 54:12.475
-Please, don't leave us.
-Don't leave us.

54:12.635 --> 54:14.795
This is the order of Candar Bey.

54:16.115 --> 54:22.355
From now on this house is consigned
firstly to Çolpan Hatun, and then to you.

54:40.555 --> 54:42.835
Skilled women of Cavdar!

54:43.795 --> 54:48.715
The hope in your eyes
and the thrill in your hearts tells me

54:49.955 --> 54:52.355
that you have heard the order
of Candar Bey.

54:53.675 --> 54:58.915
From now on,
I will lead you and this house.

55:04.755 --> 55:10.195
What's done is done.
We must look forward.

55:11.195 --> 55:14.955
We got a lot of work to do.
We must weave new rugs.

55:16.315 --> 55:21.315
My man, Ural Bey, will sell our rugs
all over the whole world.

55:22.395 --> 55:23.715
Does anybody have anything to say?

55:36.915 --> 55:39.355
What's done is done, Çolpan Hatun.

55:39.875 --> 55:41.795
It's our duty to congratulate you.

55:43.515 --> 55:45.475
Everyone, go back to work then.

56:04.835 --> 56:07.635
We have visitors coming
tomorrow night, Aslıhan Hatun.

56:08.235 --> 56:10.715
Candar Bey wants you to
begin the preparations.

56:11.355 --> 56:15.875
He wants us to serve our visitors
and their families in a fitting manner.

56:17.235 --> 56:18.595
And who might this visitor be?

56:20.755 --> 56:22.875
Ertuğrul Bey, apparently.

56:24.195 --> 56:29.035
I'm looking forward to getting to know
the man who impressed you so much.

56:29.355 --> 56:33.315
What are you talking about, Çolpan Hatun?
Why would I care about him?

56:33.555 --> 56:35.675
That wasn't what you said
at your father's table.

56:36.355 --> 56:40.035
You talked at length
about Ertuğrul's mercifulness,

56:40.515 --> 56:42.475
the way he saved that Armenian man...

56:44.875 --> 56:45.915
It was the impression I got.

56:46.875 --> 56:49.395
I couldn't care less what you think.

56:49.715 --> 56:52.755
He's a married man, with a child.

57:31.355 --> 57:34.435
<i>If Ertuğrul Bey gets to</i>
<i>Korpinar before me</i>

57:34.875 --> 57:36.275
<i>there will be hell to come.</i>

57:37.475 --> 57:40.795
<i>May God help me prevent this trouble.</i>

57:41.275 --> 57:44.275
<i>Don't let those that want</i>
<i>brother to kill brother run amok.</i>

57:45.115 --> 57:49.155
<i>Grant me the strength and courage</i>
<i>of your beloved Prophet Ali</i>

57:49.355 --> 57:51.355
<i>so that I can put an end</i>
<i>to it before it begins.</i>

58:15.315 --> 58:18.915
<i>God, </i>e<i>ven if what awaits me is a trap,</i>
<i>help me overcome it.</i>

58:19.555 --> 58:23.475
<i>You helped me become a bey,</i>
<i>trusted me with all those lives.</i>

58:23.875 --> 58:28.675
<i>Don't let me die before I find those</i>
<i>who took the lives of my men.</i>

58:57.715 --> 59:00.235
Don't you worry, sir.
I won't disappoint you.

01:00:49.635 --> 01:00:52.995
-Who might you be?
-Ertuğrul Bey sent me.

01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:57.515
He said you had something to tell him.
That you'd tell him the truth.

01:00:58.315 --> 01:01:01.435
So let's hear what you have to say.

01:01:02.435 --> 01:01:05.075
He's lying, Ertuğrul Bey
was supposed to come alone.

01:01:05.675 --> 01:01:08.275
-How did he know we were here?
-Let's find out.

01:01:10.435 --> 01:01:11.635
Tell me...

01:01:12.515 --> 01:01:17.555
how do you know it was Batuhan
who attacked Ertuğrul Bey's caravan?

01:01:18.035 --> 01:01:20.995
Who are you? How do you know that?

01:01:21.115 --> 01:01:24.835
Ertuğrul Bey would never believe
anything men like you might tell him.

01:01:25.835 --> 01:01:27.515
So you must have proof.

01:01:28.195 --> 01:01:33.355
Give it to me,
and then get out of my sight.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.635
What were you
going to give Ertuğrul Bey?

01:03:01.275 --> 01:03:04.555
-Are you guys all right?
-Sir, go on. We're okay.

01:03:04.995 --> 01:03:07.515
It seems that somebody wants to get
to Korpinar before us.

01:03:11.395 --> 01:03:14.435
What was it? Speak!

01:03:17.075 --> 01:03:18.195
Knife.

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:27.475
Batuhan!

01:05:46.035 --> 01:05:50.515
I never thought a Turk fighter like you
would weep for his friend.

01:05:51.795 --> 01:05:53.235
If you were in his stead

01:05:53.915 --> 01:05:58.275
would he come and weep for you?

01:05:58.995 --> 01:06:01.635
-No.
-What would he do?

01:06:04.075 --> 01:06:08.075
First, he'd find out who did it.
Then he'd weep for me.

01:06:10.395 --> 01:06:12.275
What would he do
when he found the thieves?

01:06:13.675 --> 01:06:16.995
He'd grab whatever was at hand,

01:06:17.355 --> 01:06:21.315
his axe, his bow, doesn't matter what,
then he'd make them pay.

01:06:22.755 --> 01:06:24.235
Not that I'd know.

01:06:25.675 --> 01:06:27.035
What I can be sure of,

01:06:27.235 --> 01:06:32.515
is that he'd make them pay for it
before he came to me.

01:06:34.635 --> 01:06:38.595
And then come to your bedside
and pray and weep for you?

01:06:39.715 --> 01:06:44.395
Yeah. Turgut is not just the head of alps,

01:06:45.115 --> 01:06:47.635
he also has a tortured soul.
More so than any of us.

01:06:49.315 --> 01:06:51.795
Everything you just told me
about Turgut Alp I already knew.

01:06:52.555 --> 01:06:57.795
-What? How could you know?
-I see a man that knows how to love.

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:01.435
He kept calling for Aykiz in his sleep.

01:07:03.115 --> 01:07:06.515
Was she his fiancée or his wife?

01:07:07.395 --> 01:07:08.595
His wife.

01:07:09.915 --> 01:07:10.995
Where is she now?

01:07:12.715 --> 01:07:15.955
She's lying in the ground now.

01:07:17.355 --> 01:07:21.355
Awaiting her man's arrival.

01:07:33.715 --> 01:07:34.755
Amanda!

01:07:35.915 --> 01:07:40.155
Stop annoying the man.
He's already in pain.

01:07:42.915 --> 01:07:47.155
Bamsi, I've always liked
strong men like you.

01:07:48.475 --> 01:07:50.915
Unbelievable. Unbelievable!

01:07:55.475 --> 01:07:58.075
Amanda, when did you get back?

01:07:59.995 --> 01:08:01.595
I came back from Nicaea this morning.

01:08:03.555 --> 01:08:06.275
-Who is this good-looking Turk?
-Turgut.

01:08:07.715 --> 01:08:09.315
Head of the Alps of Kayis.

01:08:25.955 --> 01:08:28.915
Go Turgut!

01:08:29.035 --> 01:08:30.835
Go!

01:08:31.395 --> 01:08:32.875
Faster, Turgut! Come on!

01:08:34.835 --> 01:08:35.675
Come on!

01:08:37.475 --> 01:08:41.635
-I won! I won!
-I won!

01:08:41.835 --> 01:08:44.795
-I crossed the line first.
-No, I crossed it first, are you blind?

01:08:44.995 --> 01:08:48.275
-Ask Aykiz.
-She's your fiancée, I'm not asking her.

01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:51.395
Bamsi, my man!

01:08:53.715 --> 01:08:56.715
Dogan, where are you?
Where did you go?

01:08:57.875 --> 01:09:00.155
Are you alive?
Did you fall off the face of the earth?

01:09:00.715 --> 01:09:02.195
Unbelievable!

01:09:02.715 --> 01:09:06.355
Brother, come and see
the state Turgut is in.

01:09:06.835 --> 01:09:08.315
Come and see the state I'm in.

01:09:10.115 --> 01:09:15.275
Brother, we are now at the mercy
of our greatest enemies, women!

01:09:19.275 --> 01:09:22.515
I'll make you pay for the dead horse.

01:09:23.035 --> 01:09:25.315
I gave you gold to buy me
a good horse.

01:09:26.915 --> 01:09:29.115
And what did you do?
I asked you a question!

01:09:29.555 --> 01:09:33.795
You spent it all on wine and women
and bought a sick horse!

01:09:35.435 --> 01:09:37.995
If you don't find a good horse
before we leave,

01:09:38.115 --> 01:09:39.595
I'm going to make you suffer.

01:09:39.755 --> 01:09:41.555
You'll die of hunger.

01:09:43.955 --> 01:09:46.675
This is your last chance.

01:10:01.755 --> 01:10:03.155
Are you all right?

01:10:08.195 --> 01:10:10.795
Why does he treat you like a dog?

01:10:11.835 --> 01:10:13.475
If I don't find him a horse,

01:10:14.755 --> 01:10:17.995
I'll not just be a dog,
I'll be a dead dog.

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:21.035
Don't succumb to hopelessness yet.

01:10:22.275 --> 01:10:26.395
Come, let's eat,
and think about what we can do.

01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:29.555
Come on.

01:10:30.155 --> 01:10:32.275
What's wrong?

01:10:32.635 --> 01:10:35.075
-Where are you guys going anyway?
-I'll tell you.

01:10:35.675 --> 01:10:38.595
Maria, do you think this poor man in love
will live to see the morning?

01:10:39.195 --> 01:10:41.075
I'll wait by his side till morning.

01:10:43.155 --> 01:10:44.755
If he lives, he lives.

01:10:45.915 --> 01:10:48.675
If he does get better, he'd suit you.

01:10:50.395 --> 01:10:52.395
What would I do with a Muslim man, Amanda?

01:10:53.915 --> 01:10:55.315
Love sees no religions.

01:10:55.635 --> 01:10:58.235
He may even find Jesus
and the one true path of Christianity.

01:10:59.315 --> 01:11:00.555
Poor man.

01:11:03.155 --> 01:11:05.675
From the scars of torture on his body

01:11:06.515 --> 01:11:08.275
I can see his life
has been full of hardships.

01:11:08.675 --> 01:11:10.395
Who could be so brutal?

01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:12.635
Who knows?

01:11:14.075 --> 01:11:17.155
Only the Mongols could commit
such horrendous torture.

01:11:19.515 --> 01:11:20.715
And also...

01:11:21.595 --> 01:11:22.835
those wretched ones.

01:11:24.715 --> 01:11:27.795
-Who?
-The Templars.

01:11:29.115 --> 01:11:30.755
May the devil take the lot of them!

01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:35.715
Vandals that didn't get their share
of our Lord's mercy.

01:11:39.115 --> 01:11:42.035
I must get back to my store.
I'll come back tonight.

01:11:42.435 --> 01:11:45.155
I've news from Nicaea.
We can talk more later.

01:11:46.755 --> 01:11:48.395
Did you bring me
the fragrance I asked for?

01:11:48.795 --> 01:11:51.355
Wait a while. I'll prepare it
and bring it with me tonight.

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:57.075
It might just bring Turgut to his senses,
and make him fall for you.

01:11:59.395 --> 01:12:01.115
I'll be looking forward to it.

01:12:14.195 --> 01:12:16.475
{\an8}KAYI CAMP

01:12:24.155 --> 01:12:27.875
There must be a reason
he left Turgut there.

01:12:29.635 --> 01:12:34.475
You know Ertuğrul would never
turn his back on his men.

01:12:35.515 --> 01:12:39.475
If he left Turgut there,
it must be for a fight.

01:12:40.675 --> 01:12:42.075
Mother, what are you talking about?

01:12:42.475 --> 01:12:45.275
Turgut is battling for his life.
How can he fight in that state?

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:48.275
The closer we get to our goal

01:12:49.355 --> 01:12:52.915
the more they will attack us
like rabid dogs.

01:12:54.995 --> 01:13:00.035
It's just as you said, you can't fight
these rabid dogs with swords.

01:13:01.995 --> 01:13:06.675
If you can't outsmart your opponent

01:13:07.155 --> 01:13:09.315
you'll never win the war.

01:13:12.235 --> 01:13:13.435
Who knows?

01:13:14.115 --> 01:13:17.795
Maybe Ertuğrul is doing
what the cuckoos do.

01:13:18.915 --> 01:13:20.435
Cuckoo birds?

01:13:21.515 --> 01:13:27.195
Cuckoos secretly lay their eggs
in other bird's nests.

01:13:27.635 --> 01:13:29.115
Do you know why?

01:13:32.035 --> 01:13:36.955
So that it holds on tight to life
when it hatches.

01:13:39.195 --> 01:13:42.475
-May I come in, Halime Hatun?
-Come, Rahman.

01:13:51.195 --> 01:13:53.795
The bodies are ready for burial.

01:13:54.755 --> 01:13:57.235
Ertuğrul Bey has not yet come, however.

01:14:00.275 --> 01:14:02.755
If he said he would come, then he will.

01:14:04.315 --> 01:14:07.515
We should bury them
before it gets dark, Mother.

01:14:08.795 --> 01:14:10.195
Let's go, then.

01:14:10.795 --> 01:14:11.955
My god!

01:14:24.475 --> 01:14:26.115
<i>You said you killed them all.</i>

01:14:26.355 --> 01:14:29.235
We did kill all of them.
And we burned their rugs.

01:14:29.515 --> 01:14:30.955
I killed Turgut myself.

01:14:36.355 --> 01:14:37.515
Brother...

01:14:39.595 --> 01:14:41.275
what have you done?

01:14:42.075 --> 01:14:45.315
If you plotted Toktamis Bey's
death as well...

01:14:47.755 --> 01:14:49.755
May God prevent me from going mad!

01:15:06.675 --> 01:15:07.755
Hello, sir.

01:15:09.235 --> 01:15:10.115
Hello.

01:15:10.475 --> 01:15:12.395
I'd like to get to Kayi's settlement.
Do you know the way?

01:15:13.795 --> 01:15:16.915
-Who do you want to see there?
-I have news for Ertuğrul Bey.

01:15:18.155 --> 01:15:19.195
From whom?

01:15:22.155 --> 01:15:25.475
-Why do you want to know, sir?
-Because I am Ertuğrul.

01:15:27.995 --> 01:15:29.395
And who are you?

01:15:29.715 --> 01:15:31.875
I'm the son of Candar Bey,
the Bey of Cavdar Turks.

01:15:32.555 --> 01:15:33.395
The name is Aliyar.

01:15:41.435 --> 01:15:43.235
What did you want to tell me?

01:15:43.915 --> 01:15:47.155
Candar Bey would like to invite
you and your family to dinner.

01:15:48.435 --> 01:15:49.875
My men were killed.

01:15:51.315 --> 01:15:52.515
We are grieving.

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:55.475
Give your father my thanks.

01:15:56.155 --> 01:15:58.475
-Some other time.
-Bey.

01:16:00.075 --> 01:16:02.075
That's the reason
you should accept his offer.

01:16:03.195 --> 01:16:06.235
To ensure there is not a speck of doubt
left in you.

01:16:08.715 --> 01:16:09.915
Ural Bey...

01:16:11.675 --> 01:16:12.755
Where was he last night?

01:16:14.675 --> 01:16:16.075
At the village, sir.

01:16:17.795 --> 01:16:22.395
Me, my father, my sister Aslıhan
and my brother's wife sat down and ate.

01:16:22.915 --> 01:16:24.155
We talked.

01:16:25.235 --> 01:16:28.715
I've been away studying in Damascus.
I've only just returned home.

01:16:29.315 --> 01:16:31.355
They didn't let me down, thankfully.

01:16:34.755 --> 01:16:35.875
Bey...

01:16:36.955 --> 01:16:38.955
I know you took a client from my brother.

01:16:40.235 --> 01:16:41.915
I understand your suspicions.

01:16:42.995 --> 01:16:46.275
But know that it wasn't my brother
who did this.

01:16:51.635 --> 01:16:53.555
Is that the reason
for your father's invitation?

01:16:53.995 --> 01:16:55.155
To reassure and soothe me?

01:16:55.715 --> 01:16:59.955
He was meaning to invite you
before this mishap, sir.

01:17:00.435 --> 01:17:02.035
He respects you deeply.

01:17:02.275 --> 01:17:05.715
That's why he sent me,
his son, and not an alp.

01:17:06.595 --> 01:17:12.475
Just like everybody else, he knows
how great a warrior you are. He does.

01:17:18.315 --> 01:17:20.555
Tell him I'll be his guest tomorrow.

01:17:22.435 --> 01:17:23.275
Thank you, sir.

01:19:02.515 --> 01:19:03.955
Batuhan's knife is gone.

01:19:04.835 --> 01:19:08.075
Ertuğrul didn't know about it,
so couldn't have been the one who took it.

01:19:08.915 --> 01:19:12.475
-Who, then?
-Only Petrus can answer that question.

01:19:12.955 --> 01:19:16.435
-Tell him to attend the ritual tonight.
-As you wish, Master Simon.

01:19:23.915 --> 01:19:28.355
Pray for the souls of our martyrs!

01:19:44.955 --> 01:19:46.835
Mother, Ertuğrul hasn't come back yet.

01:19:48.275 --> 01:19:51.075
He will, surely.

01:19:57.915 --> 01:19:59.075
There he is!

01:20:09.755 --> 01:20:11.115
I see five graves.

01:20:12.835 --> 01:20:14.275
The graves of five brave men.

01:20:15.435 --> 01:20:17.435
They are our first martyrs in these lands.

01:20:19.715 --> 01:20:22.715
Know this, they will not be the last.

01:20:25.715 --> 01:20:30.115
Today, we grieve.
We are burying five good men.

01:20:31.075 --> 01:20:34.795
Until we claim these lands
as rightfully ours,

01:20:36.275 --> 01:20:40.155
every battle is going to be filled
with such treachery.

01:20:41.235 --> 01:20:44.435
We will suffer more with each passing day.

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:50.715
We will not yield to the treachery
of our enemies, not in a thousand years!

01:20:52.035 --> 01:20:57.515
We will not allow these two realms
to turn us to dust.

01:20:58.435 --> 01:21:03.395
I know you will never turn
your backs on me,

01:21:04.155 --> 01:21:05.955
even if all our sons and men perish.

01:21:06.915 --> 01:21:12.275
We're heading into the most treacherous
and evil battle the world has ever seen.

01:21:14.355 --> 01:21:16.195
Losing is not an option for us.

01:21:18.075 --> 01:21:22.195
This land, like every other land,
belongs to God Almighty.

01:21:24.515 --> 01:21:29.475
We have overcome all kinds of trouble.
Now we'll put down our roots in this land.

01:21:30.835 --> 01:21:35.595
Let me say this in front of our martyrs.
May God let me be a martyr

01:21:36.155 --> 01:21:39.475
in a war which could last
a thousand years or more.

01:21:40.035 --> 01:21:41.195
-Amine!
-Amine!

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:46.155
-May God help us keep to our path!
-Amen!

01:21:48.835 --> 01:21:51.955
Allahu Akbar!

01:21:52.435 --> 01:21:57.515
Allahu Akbar!

01:21:59.475 --> 01:22:01.515
Allahu Akbar!

01:22:05.235 --> 01:22:07.035
Allahu Akbar!

01:22:12.075 --> 01:22:13.875
Allahu Akbar!

01:22:29.755 --> 01:22:30.995
May I come in, sir?

01:22:32.995 --> 01:22:34.195
Come.

01:22:41.275 --> 01:22:42.595
I couldn't find the knife, sir.

01:22:43.915 --> 01:22:47.515
An alp that loses his weapon
is no alp at all! You fool!

01:22:52.195 --> 01:22:53.595
Get out of my sight!

01:23:11.955 --> 01:23:13.595
Were you looking for this, brother?

01:23:18.955 --> 01:23:21.595
It still bears the blood
of the Kayi alps you murdered.

01:23:23.315 --> 01:23:24.875
Clean this knife well.

01:23:25.795 --> 01:23:30.955
Clean it, as if to clean
your filthy conscience.

01:23:34.435 --> 01:23:35.715
Brother...

01:23:36.955 --> 01:23:38.155
Brother...

01:23:45.315 --> 01:23:46.675
Aliyar!

01:23:49.795 --> 01:23:53.195
How many more times will you slander me?
What do you want? I've had enough!

01:24:00.675 --> 01:24:03.755
Aliyar, stop talking in circles.
Tell me what you know.

01:24:03.995 --> 01:24:07.035
My father and I both know very well
what you're up to, brother.

01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:10.995
Brother Aliyar!

01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:21.515
Get back! Get back!

01:24:38.315 --> 01:24:39.675
Whoa!

01:24:40.235 --> 01:24:43.235
My brother, we sent you away
to educate yourself,

01:24:43.475 --> 01:24:45.115
but you've returned a fierce Mongol!

01:24:46.435 --> 01:24:49.515
Don't come anywhere near me, brother.
We know what you're up to.

01:24:50.675 --> 01:24:52.995
What the hell do you know?

01:24:55.115 --> 01:24:57.195
Ural! Aliyar!

01:24:58.115 --> 01:24:59.715
Come to my tent, right now!

01:25:24.835 --> 01:25:28.275
I've had enough, Father!
Do you believe his words as well?

01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:31.675
How long do I have to put up
with their attempts to smear my name?

01:25:41.195 --> 01:25:44.115
What's happening here?
Tell me what you know.

01:25:45.755 --> 01:25:48.875
Is there anything I know
which you don't already?

01:26:08.515 --> 01:26:09.875
Father!

01:26:16.275 --> 01:26:22.795
I know what you've been up to, Ural.
I also know you cannot be redeemed.

01:26:23.755 --> 01:26:26.995
You are the biggest
threat to our survival.

01:26:27.795 --> 01:26:33.435
If you weren't my first child
with your late mother

01:26:33.835 --> 01:26:36.155
I'd have killed you long ago.

01:26:37.315 --> 01:26:40.155
-Father--
-Aliyar saved your life.

01:26:41.635 --> 01:26:45.595
Not just yours,
those of many of our men, too.

01:26:45.715 --> 01:26:46.995
Do you know why?

01:26:48.635 --> 01:26:51.235
Because he found Batuhan's knife

01:26:52.075 --> 01:26:55.355
and stopped Ertuğrul
getting his hands on it.

01:26:58.315 --> 01:27:02.195
Ertuğrul is not a fool like you, Ural.

01:27:02.675 --> 01:27:06.635
Pray that I succeed in convincing him
that you are innocent.

01:27:08.955 --> 01:27:15.675
When they arrive, you will serve them,
along with your impudent wife.

01:27:16.755 --> 01:27:20.235
You will show them respect.

01:27:21.075 --> 01:27:22.395
Do you understand?

01:27:39.195 --> 01:27:40.235
Brother...

01:28:13.275 --> 01:28:14.395
Guards.

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:24.115
-Father...
-Aliyar, leave me alone.

01:28:33.555 --> 01:28:34.715
Guards!

01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:12.150
The same people who killed our Alps
got to Korpinar before we did.

01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:21.030
They followed us to the bazaar.
The degenerates were right behind us.

01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:25.390
Clearly, he is afraid of the consequences
of revealing the truth.

01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:28.910
Being afraid is no good
in the face of the death.

01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:42.110
My God, please deliver me
from spilling Muslim blood.

01:29:44.150 --> 01:29:45.470
What are you saying, sir?

01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:56.430
I'm suspicious of Candaroglu Ural Bey.

01:29:58.430 --> 01:30:00.070
Unfortunately, nothing else is possible.

01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:03.790
He didn't take it well
when we sold our rugs.

01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:06.670
He's never wanted us on these lands.

01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:10.630
I hope Ural Bey is not so contemptible

01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:14.150
that he would spill the blood
of Muslims for a few coins, sir.

01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:19.350
That's not all. Candar Bey was
desperate to invite us to his tent,

01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:25.070
he even got his son to invite us.
That and Ural Bey's threats towards me...

01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:28.670
If that's the case,
many will die from both tribes.

01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:32.190
There will be fierce battles ahead.

01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:40.430
If Candar Bey doesn't sacrifice his son,

01:30:42.190 --> 01:30:44.670
we're not strong enough to fight them.

01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:55.870
We will find a way, Artuk Bey.

01:30:57.990 --> 01:31:00.150
Then we will shake the tree by its roots.

01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:04.710
If Candar Bey fails to deliver justice,

01:31:06.150 --> 01:31:08.350
we will rip the tree out.

01:31:35.150 --> 01:31:37.350
-One more, brother?
-Sure.

01:31:40.710 --> 01:31:42.070
Here you go, brother.

01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:58.870
You are quite a drinker, Bamsi.
And still standing, like a pillar.

01:31:59.870 --> 01:32:01.990
My late father was a hardened drinker too.

01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:05.710
He could drink three pints
without any sort of bother.

01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:07.350
-Three?
-Yes.

01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:17.310
Three it is, but never mind the numbers.

01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:18.950
Now tell me something.

01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:24.910
You bought my horse, where are you
headed with your master?

01:32:25.630 --> 01:32:29.230
-The island of Lesbos.
-Lesbos?

01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:31.430
Man, where is that?

01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:36.070
Get on a ship in Constantinople.

01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:38.270
Okay.

01:32:39.190 --> 01:32:41.030
Go through the Dardanelles.

01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:44.030
So I do, brother.

01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:48.110
-Go straight ahead.
-I'm going straight ahead.

01:32:48.230 --> 01:32:50.790
-Keep going for a while.
-I am, brother.

01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:57.430
So I keep going, I've been through
these Dardanelles. Then where am I?

01:32:58.350 --> 01:33:00.070
Lesbos, for God's sake.

01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:02.990
-It's an island.
-An island.

01:33:03.190 --> 01:33:07.630
It's a huge island.

01:33:07.710 --> 01:33:09.910
-A huge island.
-Yes.

01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:15.590
Pirates take the slaves they've captured
in the Mediterranean to Lesbos.

01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:17.870
And Master Tristan...

01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:23.550
goes to Cunda, across the island,

01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:27.470
-buys the best slaves...
-He does.

01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:30.790
...brings them to the bazaar
and sells them.

01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:39.230
-Get it now?
-I do, man. I do.

01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:45.270
Dardanelles, Lesbos, Cunda.

01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:48.870
-Cunda, Lesbos...
-Dardanelles.

01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:55.390
Pour us one more!

01:33:56.150 --> 01:33:58.950
-One more glass of wine.
-Yes, one more.

01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:01.750
There you go.

01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:05.350
Take care.

01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:10.830
Dardanelles, Lesbos, Cunda. Dardanelles...

01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:15.470
Lesbos, Cunda.

01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:23.630
Dardanelles, Lesbos, Cunda.
Dardanelles, Lesbos, Cunda.

01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:45.030
-Are they downstairs, John the Baptist?
-They are waiting for you, sir.

01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:28.630
Here we go, sir.

01:36:25.950 --> 01:36:28.190
Mentor Nicola D'artagnan.

01:36:37.630 --> 01:36:41.790
Welcome to the residence of your loyal
guards, Mentor Nicola D'artagnan.

01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:44.310
May God bless you all.

01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:50.990
John the Baptist, as you'll have guessed,
I'm here because of Ertuğrul.

01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:06.590
Everything you need to know
about him is written here.

01:37:10.630 --> 01:37:15.750
Mentor Petruccio
of the crusader region of Antakya

01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:19.150
wrote it himself.

01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:25.430
After Mentor Petruccio
was killed by Ertuğrul,

01:37:25.710 --> 01:37:30.270
a young knight salvaged this book
from the Turks and brought it to us.

01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:33.750
The very last lines were written
by that brave knight.

01:37:34.190 --> 01:37:36.870
-Is he also the killer of Titus?
-Yes.

01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:42.990
-The war has begun, John the Baptist.
-What do you require of me?

01:37:46.150 --> 01:37:48.590
Ertuğrul's presence here
cannot be a coincidence.

01:37:49.110 --> 01:37:51.350
I want you to kill him immediately.

01:37:59.950 --> 01:38:02.270
Petrus, my dear boy!

01:38:09.230 --> 01:38:10.830
Welcome, Mentor D'artagnan.

01:38:26.590 --> 01:38:27.910
It was a relative of Ural...

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:32.550
who took the dagger and killed our men.

01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:35.270
-Aslihan?
-No.

01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:37.110
Aliyar.

01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:56.670
Everywhere is surrounded
by a mighty fog.

01:38:58.990 --> 01:39:03.310
One does not simply see
or hear the other.

01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:08.870
The war between life and death,

01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:12.430
conscience and gold,
purity and corruption, continues.

01:39:12.670 --> 01:39:15.110
And we are in the middle of it, sir.

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:21.390
People are trading
and laughing with each other,

01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:24.670
while digging each other's graves.

01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:29.110
On one side, there are the Crusaders
who set Constantinople alight.

01:39:30.190 --> 01:39:33.230
On another, the emperor
who fled from the Byzantium.

01:39:33.670 --> 01:39:36.710
And finally, the Turks,
who want to make these lands their home.

01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:41.430
Don't forget the bandits,
vandals, pirates...

01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:47.150
The local people of these lands
are crying their eyes out.

01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:51.390
This is a complex war, sir.

01:39:51.670 --> 01:39:55.670
As you said, it's a war between
existence and extinction.

01:39:58.150 --> 01:40:03.190
We will make our way out
of this blinding fog.

01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:07.270
We will draw our swords
only once, Artuk Bey.

01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:10.870
God willing, sir.

01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:15.270
And once we do, these lands
will meet with justice and freedom.

01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:24.230
Is this the reason you accepted
Candar Bey's invitation, sir?

01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:32.190
Everything begins
in the tent of Candar Bey, Lady Halime,

01:40:32.710 --> 01:40:34.790
and ends under the soft light of the inn.

01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:43.190
We have to figure our way out of this fog
without making a mistake.

01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:51.390
That's why we accepted
Candar Bey's invitation.

01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:10.790
So you want to play, Aliyar.

01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:18.870
The one thing more dangerous than
a brave enemy who knows how to fight

01:41:19.110 --> 01:41:21.630
is an enemy who is smart enough
to see and take control of the game.

01:41:23.550 --> 01:41:26.910
The game we set was taken down.
Damn it!

01:41:30.630 --> 01:41:32.190
I will chop off your head.

01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:34.750
What should we do now, Master Simon?

01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:40.030
We will give the murderers
of those Alps to Ertuğrul Bey.

01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:44.390
No matter what it takes, the two Muslim
tribes must fight each other.

01:41:44.710 --> 01:41:48.870
The blood of your own kin is cursed.
No one can stem it once it's spilled.

01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:51.030
Right.

01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:57.390
You are right, Master Simon, but we lost
our only leverage against Ural.

01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:03.750
You are wrong, dear Petrus.

01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:08.310
Our greatest leverage
is the ambition of Ural.

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:12.990
This ambition will be the end
of him and of his tribe.

01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:15.830
Aliyar is trying to stop
the war his own way.

01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:18.590
But it has already begun.

01:42:30.630 --> 01:42:36.270
<i>Esselamu aleykum ve rahmetullah.</i>

01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:50.030
My God,

01:42:51.630 --> 01:42:53.630
please forgive my sins.

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:56.390
I raised Ural.

01:42:58.230 --> 01:43:01.710
I took good care of him. I thought
he was the great hope of the Cavdars.

01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:09.830
Now, I'm afraid my tribe
will pay the price for my sins.

01:43:11.630 --> 01:43:17.830
Help me kill the demon
inside my son, God.

01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:09.350
I won't forget this favor, Lady Aslihan,
it is much appreciated.

01:45:10.350 --> 01:45:11.710
<i>Bey of the Kayis.</i>

01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:14.630
<i>A brave man.</i>

01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:23.910
<i>Fought and won many battles.</i>

01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:27.550
<i>A true gentleman.</i>

01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:31.470
Thank you, Lady Aslihan.

01:45:55.190 --> 01:45:58.270
Enough is enough.
Tell me everything, Lady Aslihan.

01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:04.030
No matter how much you, my father
and Ural try,

01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:08.350
-you won't be able to hide the truth.
-What do you mean, Aslihan?

01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:17.590
We know very well
who killed Ertuğrul Bey's Alps.

01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:18.990
Lady!

01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:22.510
How did you arrive at that conclusion?

01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:27.110
It was Ural and you know it.

01:46:27.710 --> 01:46:30.510
Ural is my husband and your brother.

01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:37.470
Save the speech, Lady Colpan.
Ural is bringing us closer to our doom.

01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:41.190
As his wife, you should take care of it.

01:46:43.110 --> 01:46:44.590
That's all I have to say.

01:46:46.230 --> 01:46:49.230
Liar! You can't blame Ural Bey.

01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:54.150
If I hear you speak any more lies
about him you'll pay dearly for it.

01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:58.110
And that's all I have to say.

01:47:19.630 --> 01:47:21.990
I've prepared the gifts
we'll take tomorrow.

01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:27.190
These are fine gifts.

01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:31.230
Small, but valuable.

01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:34.230
The most valuable thing...

01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:38.710
is to be a guest in his tent
with my wife and mother.

01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:41.310
Only if they understand its value.

01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:07.430
With all your suspicions about Ural Bey...

01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:15.190
I have no doubts about Candar Bey,
Aliyar or Lady Aslihan.

01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:18.790
-Who is Lady Aslihan?
-Candar Bey's daughter.

01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:21.830
She helped sell the rugs.

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:24.310
Is that so?

01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:29.870
She must be a very kind woman.

01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:09.710
Your wound is worse.

01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:13.030
It'll heal.

01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:20.590
Before it does, those who wounded me
will pay for what they've done.

01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:23.390
I don't doubt that, sir.

01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:28.230
But how did Aliyar acquire
the dagger of Batuhan?

01:49:29.590 --> 01:49:31.350
Before long, I will figure out...

01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:35.790
who is behind this.

01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:40.230
Simon's sister found Turgut, right?

01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:42.830
-What is her name?
-Maria.

01:49:43.630 --> 01:49:45.190
What if she found the dagger?

01:49:47.590 --> 01:49:51.590
-Then it was Simon.
-What's done is done, sir.

01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:57.470
Candar Bey is watching every step
you take, every move you make.

01:50:01.190 --> 01:50:07.310
As if all this wasn't enough,
he appointed Aliyar to protect me.

01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:09.510
And Aslihan knows everything.

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:14.190
The situation has gotten out of control.

01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:17.790
What are you implying, my Çolpan?

01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:24.390
It's high time we took control
of the tribe and the bazaar.

01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:30.910
Simon and your father
won't put up with you for much longer.

01:50:31.630 --> 01:50:34.870
Aslihan and Aliyar will see to that.

01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:42.390
I can't let that happen. No.

01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:46.470
I will crush whoever stands in my way.

01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:52.430
-Don't you know that, my Çolpan?
-What about your father?

01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:57.110
Will you crush him, too?

01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:22.510
Do you doubt me, my Colpan?

01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:26.910
Of course not. Never.

01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:14.830
Get up!

01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:17.270
We have business with you.

01:52:55.150 --> 01:52:58.430
<i>-Selamun aleykum.</i>
<i>-Aleykum selam.</i>

01:53:07.070 --> 01:53:10.470
I can't even look at your...

01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:13.630
or at the faces of these young Alps, sir.

01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:21.550
It wasn't gold that kept us here
for a thousand years, Hacaturyan.

01:53:22.590 --> 01:53:24.190
And it never will be.

01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:31.710
We follow God's path.
Our destination is clear.

01:53:35.230 --> 01:53:39.590
This old head of mine
didn't show me the right way.

01:53:40.710 --> 01:53:44.070
But if I go once more,
I can find the right path.

01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:48.270
Give me one more chance, sir.

01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:51.510
That's enough, craftsman Hacaturyan.

01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:55.230
Go and rest.

01:53:58.150 --> 01:54:00.190
If you want to pay your debt to me,

01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:04.270
go and lead a peaceful life in my tribe.

01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:08.550
Share your wisdom with the young,

01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:14.790
so that they may have the most
valuable asset in the world: a profession.

01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:18.710
-Do you understand?
-I do, sir.

01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:27.910
Brother, Abdurrahman told us
what happened. How is Turgut Alp?

01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:31.990
He will get better, with God's permission.

01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:39.630
We are to be guests of Candar Bey.
The tribe is yours to protect.

01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:15.470
Are these the men who killed the Kayi Alps

01:55:15.670 --> 01:55:19.150
and burned the rugs?

01:55:20.430 --> 01:55:21.390
Yes, sir.

01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:24.790
Is that all of them?

01:55:26.230 --> 01:55:27.230
Yes, sir.

01:56:55.790 --> 01:57:02.310
We alone will know what Ural did, right?

01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:04.030
Yes, sir.

01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:09.230
Are you man enough
to keep such a secret, Batuhan?

01:57:09.670 --> 01:57:10.750
I am, sir.

01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:14.950
We will see, we will see.

01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:18.670
What will you do now?

01:57:19.390 --> 01:57:22.630
I will tell you every single
step Ural Bey takes, sir.

01:57:36.190 --> 01:57:40.110
Have no doubts, Mentor Nicola.
Ertuğrul will die.

01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:44.830
You'll pay a grand price if you
delay this mission, John the Baptist.

01:57:45.710 --> 01:57:48.150
I can't understand why
you're so afraid of a Turk.

01:57:48.910 --> 01:57:53.030
You don't know him. You'll understand
more once you've read the book.

01:57:53.230 --> 01:57:56.950
If I kill him, I'll never know
if he is the Sultan's spy.

01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:59.270
I need more time.

01:57:59.910 --> 01:58:02.870
Until Easter then, Simon.

01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:08.070
If Ertuğrul isn't dead by then,
the council will send someone else here.

01:58:13.670 --> 01:58:15.590
As you wish, Mentor Nicola.

01:58:16.670 --> 01:58:19.630
Saadeddin Kopek will be here soon.

01:58:20.150 --> 01:58:23.830
Don't forget, he'll be your closest ally.

01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:27.350
You both have the same enemy.
Sultan Alaaddin.

01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:38.710
The only reason you have such
an important mission at this young age

01:58:39.230 --> 01:58:40.870
is my trust in you.

01:58:41.630 --> 01:58:44.550
Don't let me down
in the eyes of the council.

01:59:42.310 --> 01:59:43.710
They are coming.

01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:50.910
Here he comes with his family.

01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:57.430
Yes, the tribe of Kayi.

02:00:08.230 --> 02:00:09.910
-Abdurrahman.
-Yes, sir.

02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:14.350
As I said, stay sharp.
Keep a close watch of Ural and Batuhan.

02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:16.190
Don't worry, sir.

02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:24.390
-Welcome.
-Welcome, sir.

02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:42.750
Where is Ural, Lady Çolpan?

02:00:43.110 --> 02:00:44.790
Must have important business, sir.

02:01:01.150 --> 02:01:02.710
Brave Alps of Cavdar!

02:01:19.950 --> 02:01:21.870
<i>-Selamun aleykum.</i>
<i>-Aleykum selam.</i>

02:01:28.110 --> 02:01:33.550
Welcome to my home, Ertuğrul Bey.
We are honored to have you here.

02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:35.710
The honor is mine, Candar Bey.

02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:37.910
Lady Hayme, my mother.

02:01:41.110 --> 02:01:42.470
Lady Halime, my wife.

02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:49.390
Our loyal doctor, Artuk Bey.

02:01:51.950 --> 02:01:55.710
Welcome, all of you. Aliyar, my son...

02:01:57.630 --> 02:01:59.190
Aslihan, my daughter...

02:02:02.590 --> 02:02:06.830
Lady Çolpan, wife of Ural Bey.
He will be here soon.

02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:08.670
Go ahead, come in.

02:02:41.310 --> 02:02:43.670
Ertuğrul Bey
and his family have arrived, sir.

02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:46.230
Very well.

02:02:47.190 --> 02:02:49.790
-What happened with the old man?
-Just like you said, sir.

02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:53.710
He killed the men
with whom we raided the Kayi caravan.

02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:55.150
Is that all? What else?

02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:58.310
He wants to know every move you make.

02:02:59.070 --> 02:03:00.790
Good, then you'll tell him everything.

02:03:02.190 --> 02:03:04.150
Let's not keep the guests waiting.
Come on.

02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:39.830
Thank you.

02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:56.230
No peace or trade is possible
where bandits roam free.

02:03:57.670 --> 02:04:00.510
I assure you I'll do all I can to help

02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:05.270
when you go after those bandits,
Ertuğrul Bey.

02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:10.590
I want you to know that we are sorry
for your martyrs, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:16.790
We can't find peace or prosperity
in these unclaimed lands.

02:04:17.670 --> 02:04:22.190
Order can be provided by a certain man,
Aliyar Bey. Sultan Alaaddin.

02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:29.830
Who has the duty until that holy day
comes and our flag dances in the wind?

02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:33.470
It's our duty...

02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:37.750
to stop the bandits and restore order.

02:04:41.590 --> 02:04:46.950
We have to protect our religion,
honor and goods

02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:48.830
until that day comes.

02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:06.390
<i>-Selamun aleykum.</i>
<i>-Aleykum selam.</i>

02:05:08.590 --> 02:05:10.150
Do I have your permission, sir?

02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:13.270
Go ahead, Ural Bey, sit.

02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:30.710
Welcome.

02:05:32.710 --> 02:05:33.670
Thank you.

02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:39.150
-I was waiting for you.
-Really, sir?

02:05:39.990 --> 02:05:44.550
Ertuğrul Bey says it's our duty

02:05:45.230 --> 02:05:47.070
to restore order in these lands.

02:05:48.190 --> 02:05:50.830
And to stop the bandits.

02:05:54.670 --> 02:06:00.590
I wish to make a pact with this brave
and honorable Bey and live in peace.

02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:05.870
That's why I wanted to take
the first step.

02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:12.750
The Venetians want 1,500 rugs from us.

02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:18.310
It's almost impossible to deliver
such an order until spring.

02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:24.270
But if the skilled ladies
of the two tribes join forces,

02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:28.550
then I say everyone will win.

02:06:34.230 --> 02:06:35.790
What are you saying, sir?

02:06:35.950 --> 02:06:40.390
As a token of our friendship,
I offer business to the Kayis.

02:06:51.390 --> 02:06:55.030
I have already said what's on my mind.

02:06:55.590 --> 02:07:00.190
The important thing now is
to find out what's on Ertuğrul Bey's mind.
