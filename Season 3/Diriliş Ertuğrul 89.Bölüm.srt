WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 89 will start after 12:40 min.

13:07.665 --> 13:09.745
Were you expecting Emir Sadettin,
my Sultan?

13:10.145 --> 13:11.065
No.

13:12.945 --> 13:14.505
But it's good he's here.

13:15.385 --> 13:17.865
He should know of my decision
concerning your new duty.

13:19.585 --> 13:23.065
When I return, I'll leave
Sadettin here to support you.

13:39.905 --> 13:40.825
My Sultan.

13:47.945 --> 13:49.985
What brings you here, Sadettin?

13:52.665 --> 13:55.265
My marriage to Aslihan Hatun, my Sultan.

13:56.585 --> 14:01.665
But her father's death,
and now Aliyar Bey...

14:03.225 --> 14:04.625
It's good that you're here.

14:05.985 --> 14:08.265
That you came in time
for Aliyar Bey's funeral.

14:11.865 --> 14:16.025
Also, after talking over some
matters with Ertugrul Bey,

14:16.145 --> 14:17.945
I've come to a decision.

14:21.145 --> 14:22.785
A decision you should be told about.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.065
I hope it's good news, my Sultan.

14:31.385 --> 14:35.665
Ertugrul Bey is now
the chief Bey of my state.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.985
He will govern these lands.

14:50.785 --> 14:54.905
It's an honor for me to serve
my state and nation, my Sultan.

15:00.025 --> 15:03.705
I have no doubt my Sultan
has made the right decision.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.785
Ever since Ertugrul Bey
first came to these lands

15:09.425 --> 15:12.105
he has been my eyes and ears.

15:14.305 --> 15:17.865
I know everything that happens here
thanks to the information he provides.

15:21.905 --> 15:24.705
I trust and respect him.

15:31.465 --> 15:35.185
Ertugrul Bey has fulfilled his duty well.

15:36.185 --> 15:40.585
I now intend to fulfil the great mission
our Sultan has entrusted me with, Emir.

15:45.225 --> 15:47.825
As you command, my Sultan.

15:49.585 --> 15:53.945
I have no doubt Ertugrul Bey
can carry out this task

15:54.385 --> 15:56.505
given his loyalty to the state.

16:01.225 --> 16:04.865
I will do my best to always support him.

16:06.385 --> 16:07.465
God willing.

16:12.185 --> 16:16.625
I would like to go to Hanli bazaar now
to discuss my plans with both of you.

16:17.185 --> 16:20.985
Afterwards he will organize a council
meeting of the Turk tribes.

16:21.625 --> 16:24.865
When the Beys arrive, I will see them.

16:26.265 --> 16:29.625
I will inform them
of my decision, personally.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.065
Still no news.

17:17.865 --> 17:19.825
Patience, Nikolas. Patience.

17:22.105 --> 17:27.665
I have learned that only patience
brings victory against the Turks.

17:28.625 --> 17:29.865
And if she doesn't succeed?

17:31.785 --> 17:34.145
Everyone knows she's Ural's wife.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.225
If she doesn't...

17:46.505 --> 17:47.945
If she doesn't...

17:48.785 --> 17:53.145
then we'll have lost one more
on our way to victory.

17:54.025 --> 17:56.745
And we'll never know
who that merchant actually is.

17:57.665 --> 18:01.225
Emir Sadettin wouldn't have
come here for no reason.

18:02.385 --> 18:05.625
Emir Sadettin is like a fly
chasing the light.

18:06.425 --> 18:07.905
If the Emir is here...

18:10.105 --> 18:13.425
if the news given by the Emperor is true,

18:14.905 --> 18:18.185
then we'll extinguish
their light forever, Nikolas.

18:20.665 --> 18:24.305
Then let's hope Ekaterina brings us
the information we want.

18:37.858 --> 18:38.898
Men!

18:40.458 --> 18:42.778
Keep your assigned positions.

18:43.858 --> 18:45.098
Be alert!

18:46.178 --> 18:47.298
Don't let anyone come close.

18:49.498 --> 18:50.498
Understood?

18:50.618 --> 18:52.978
Yes, Commander Turgut!

19:19.818 --> 19:21.618
Now, I want archers to hold the rooftops.

19:21.738 --> 19:23.658
Yes, Commander Turgut!

19:23.938 --> 19:26.018
Take your positions, everyone!

19:26.458 --> 19:27.818
-Yes, sir!
-Come on.

19:50.578 --> 19:52.218
Faster!

20:21.338 --> 20:23.378
Turgut, brother!

20:25.538 --> 20:26.818
Brother.

20:28.218 --> 20:33.578
Brother, we filled the stream bed
with our men.

20:34.098 --> 20:35.058
All right, brother.

20:35.338 --> 20:38.298
Not even Genghis Khan could pierce
our defenses.

20:38.498 --> 20:42.498
I hope that Emir Sadettin or whoever
sleeps without worry now.

20:44.098 --> 20:47.058
All this fuss is not for Emir Sadettin.

20:48.618 --> 20:52.418
It's unlikely that Ertuğrul Bey
would lift a finger for him.

20:55.498 --> 20:58.418
Then, what's all this measure for?
For who?

21:01.378 --> 21:03.058
Abu Mansur.

21:04.498 --> 21:05.498
Good.

21:05.698 --> 21:09.498
If it's for that brave merchant
that we know nothing about...

21:11.938 --> 21:14.898
Anyway, brother. I don't mind helping him.

21:15.098 --> 21:19.458
He swung his sword to save
all of us once.

21:20.418 --> 21:22.538
Do you still believe that
he's a mere merchant?

21:22.618 --> 21:24.058
He isn't?

21:24.538 --> 21:26.738
Then what on earth is he? An angel?

21:50.178 --> 21:51.778
<i>May I enter?</i>

21:53.018 --> 21:54.698
<i>Sadaq Allah Al-Azeem.</i>

21:58.538 --> 21:59.778
Come in.

22:02.218 --> 22:03.178
<i>As salaam wa alaikum.</i>

22:03.418 --> 22:05.018
<i>Wa alaikum as salaam.</i>

22:06.818 --> 22:08.378
Welcome, Your Highness.

22:15.658 --> 22:16.858
Thank you.

22:17.578 --> 22:20.858
As it stands, I must be in disguise.

22:21.658 --> 22:26.738
I wish I could have met you before
to take your blessings.

22:27.218 --> 22:28.818
Even in the thick of it,

22:28.978 --> 22:32.458
I know that you do what you must do,
Your Highness.

22:34.138 --> 22:36.498
I figured it out when I saw you
at the cemetery.

22:38.378 --> 22:39.698
Come in.

22:54.618 --> 22:56.698
Our prophet says thus:

22:58.658 --> 23:00.778
"When two Muslims get together,

23:01.658 --> 23:03.738
God ensures that,

23:04.618 --> 23:06.298
as a reward,

23:06.738 --> 23:10.018
both are beneficial to each other."

23:12.418 --> 23:15.378
Thank God for getting us together.

23:16.298 --> 23:17.458
Amen.

23:19.018 --> 23:20.898
We are surrounded by the enemy.

23:22.938 --> 23:26.098
I came here to take your blessings,

23:26.458 --> 23:28.778
destroy the devil's nest Karacahisar,

23:29.458 --> 23:31.178
and pave the way for conquest.

23:32.618 --> 23:35.338
May God help you in your quest.

23:37.658 --> 23:41.138
Thank God for letting such a bey...

23:42.098 --> 23:43.658
meet such a sultan,

23:44.018 --> 23:47.458
and for allowing our sultan
to work for his cause.

23:48.738 --> 23:50.378
May your unity be everlasting.

23:51.178 --> 23:52.698
-Amen.
-Amen.

24:02.818 --> 24:04.418
Death in one ring...

24:08.058 --> 24:10.098
and life in another.

24:14.858 --> 24:16.618
So, what am I afraid of?

24:20.338 --> 24:21.618
Come on, Sadettin.

24:22.538 --> 24:23.578
Finish this.

24:40.658 --> 24:42.338
We are ready to leave, sir.

24:42.698 --> 24:43.938
All right, Cabir.

24:44.618 --> 24:46.218
Let Ertuğrul Bey know

24:46.658 --> 24:48.578
that we are going to the bazaar.

24:51.058 --> 24:52.098
Guards!

25:07.138 --> 25:08.778
Were you here, too?

25:12.658 --> 25:14.938
Many a great army has saluted me.

25:16.378 --> 25:17.978
And I brought many more to their knees.

25:19.458 --> 25:22.858
I was never trampled over
as you trample over me.

25:24.778 --> 25:26.698
-Your Highness, I--
-Silence!

25:29.218 --> 25:32.658
If love is the fluttering of a bird
that's fallen from its nest,

25:33.698 --> 25:36.698
then I, too, shall flutter to get to you
until I die.

25:39.418 --> 25:40.618
I will never,

25:41.538 --> 25:42.898
ever,

25:44.138 --> 25:46.538
let anybody take you away from me.

25:49.818 --> 25:52.338
I harbor no love in my heart,
Your Highness.

25:53.378 --> 25:56.458
Whatever I did, I did for my tribe.

25:57.058 --> 26:00.178
Just as how you do everything
for the sake of your country.

26:04.898 --> 26:06.498
Don't you know that...

26:09.378 --> 26:11.858
I see through your lie
as I look into your eyes?

26:14.178 --> 26:16.778
Do you think I don't know who...

26:18.098 --> 26:21.138
gives you the courage to lead your tribe?

26:22.378 --> 26:27.058
Ertuğrul Bey became the hope
of my tribe, and as he became mine.

26:27.458 --> 26:29.218
God bless him.

26:29.658 --> 26:31.298
This is the truth.

26:38.658 --> 26:43.898
We both know very well
what the truth is, right?

26:46.738 --> 26:48.258
Let me go!

26:49.538 --> 26:51.098
You are hurting me.

26:53.698 --> 26:54.858
The truth is that...

26:55.498 --> 27:00.858
you still haven't let Ertuğrul,
who you once loved, go.

27:04.778 --> 27:06.578
Is it not true?

27:07.858 --> 27:09.378
Is it not the truth?

27:09.978 --> 27:11.538
Tell me.

27:14.578 --> 27:15.818
Is it not?

27:15.978 --> 27:17.498
It's not true!

27:17.818 --> 27:19.258
It's not true!

27:29.938 --> 27:33.858
I'll never give up on you, Aslıhan.

27:35.618 --> 27:36.858
Never.

27:47.658 --> 27:50.978
Nobody will be able to take you
away from me.

27:52.458 --> 27:53.738
Not even him.

28:00.578 --> 28:03.658
There is grief in separation,
and hope in unity.

28:04.698 --> 28:07.578
Now, you, as a fine ruler,

28:08.778 --> 28:13.458
and you, as a fine supporter,
strive to establish our unity.

28:15.778 --> 28:18.418
God loves those who
get along well together.

28:19.578 --> 28:24.698
I believe that this unity will bear fruit
and lead to conquest.

28:26.298 --> 28:27.338
I hope so.

28:28.018 --> 28:29.258
I hope so, too.

28:32.338 --> 28:36.618
Tomorrow, we will hold a meeting
that our sultan will attend, as well.

28:37.138 --> 28:38.658
We'd like to see you among us.

28:41.898 --> 28:44.218
It's our tradition to accept invitations.

28:45.578 --> 28:47.818
If my fate allows it,
I'll attend for sure.

28:49.618 --> 28:52.098
May God bless you with a long life,

28:52.778 --> 28:56.978
and allow us to benefit
from your wisdom and understanding.

28:57.818 --> 28:59.698
<i>May I enter, sir?</i>

29:00.258 --> 29:01.978
Come in, Abdur Rahman.

29:07.738 --> 29:09.338
Emir Sadettin says he's ready, sir.

29:09.658 --> 29:11.858
He's waiting for you to leave
for the bazaar.

29:20.778 --> 29:23.138
Be prepared for everything, Cabir.

29:24.498 --> 29:26.698
A huge storm is closing in.

29:26.938 --> 29:28.898
Don't you breathe a word.

29:29.178 --> 29:31.938
-Understood?
-As you wish, sir.

29:32.178 --> 29:33.778
My life belongs to you alone.

29:35.658 --> 29:36.658
Good.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.498
We sent for other beys, Aslıhan Hatun.

30:05.258 --> 30:07.178
We'll have a meeting tomorrow at the inn.

30:07.818 --> 30:09.618
I'll be sure to be there, Ertuğrul Bey.

30:09.978 --> 30:13.098
I'll represent my brother with honor.

30:14.138 --> 30:15.698
Till the day I die.

30:16.538 --> 30:19.818
Or a new bey is chosen.

30:24.178 --> 30:25.658
Emir Sadettin,

30:25.778 --> 30:28.978
I may not be a bey,
but I'm a servant of my tribe.

30:30.138 --> 30:32.978
There is no doubt that...

30:33.538 --> 30:37.418
you will do justice by the duty
you have been entrusted with.

30:38.538 --> 30:40.458
My duty will not be completed

30:40.818 --> 30:43.738
until I avenge my brother,
Emir Sadettin.

30:44.538 --> 30:47.458
I carry my tribe and my country
on my shoulders.

30:48.938 --> 30:52.298
It's my duty to carry this esteemed
burden forever.

30:56.458 --> 30:59.578
If your brother and your sultan saw you,

31:00.178 --> 31:02.778
I'm sure they'd be proud of you,
Aslıhan Hatun.

31:03.458 --> 31:08.298
The Seljuks will rise on the shoulders
of such brave Turk women as yourself.

31:09.698 --> 31:11.978
Thank you, Abu Mansur.

31:15.938 --> 31:19.978
We hope to pay our due respect
for Aliyar Bey with this meeting.

31:21.178 --> 31:22.498
May God grant our wishes.

31:22.978 --> 31:23.938
Amen.

31:24.618 --> 31:25.618
Amen.

31:57.378 --> 31:58.978
Bismillah.

32:01.738 --> 32:03.978
Blessed be the one that gave you to us.

32:11.098 --> 32:12.978
-Mother.
-Yes?

32:13.298 --> 32:15.698
I wonder why the sultan came
all the way over here.

32:16.218 --> 32:19.258
Dear, don't you know
what kind of place this is?

32:19.938 --> 32:23.058
He surely must have come
to alleviate a problem.

32:23.738 --> 32:25.978
Then why does he keep it a secret
from everyone?

32:26.338 --> 32:29.018
Why did he come in disguise?

32:30.658 --> 32:34.538
Who knows? He must have his reasons.

32:42.458 --> 32:45.298
I'm scared of something happening
to Ertuğrul.

32:47.938 --> 32:49.018
My dear.

32:49.698 --> 32:54.098
The sultan believes in Ertuğrul.
That's why he's here.

32:54.938 --> 32:57.738
Don't let such trivial things get to you.

32:58.898 --> 33:02.578
With God's permission,
these challenging days shall pass soon.

33:02.738 --> 33:04.098
I hope it does, Mother.

33:04.938 --> 33:07.418
May God protect them from evil.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.058
Amen.

33:12.738 --> 33:15.418
Your grandmother loves you so much.

33:24.538 --> 33:25.858
Ural is dead.

33:27.498 --> 33:29.018
Aliyar is dead.

33:29.378 --> 33:30.978
The Cavdar tribe is left without a leader.

33:32.378 --> 33:35.378
Ertuğrul will try to take them
under his dominion.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.778
He will try.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.058
Let him.

33:42.618 --> 33:45.018
The fate of the Cavdars lies in my hands.

33:48.778 --> 33:50.618
What do you mean, Vasilius?

33:52.258 --> 33:55.458
Ekaterina carries the heir
to the Cavdar tribe in her womb.

33:56.898 --> 33:58.338
How is that even possible?

33:58.578 --> 34:01.898
The last favor Ural did for us
before he died.

34:09.218 --> 34:11.738
Always one step ahead, Vasilius.

34:13.938 --> 34:16.818
It's much too soon to celebrate, Nikolas.

34:17.018 --> 34:20.538
First, I must ensure that Ekaterina
is loyal to me.

34:21.058 --> 34:22.178
What are you suspicious of?

34:22.858 --> 34:23.978
What did we say?

34:24.258 --> 34:26.218
Clever women are dangerous.

34:26.778 --> 34:30.618
But you are the cleverest commander
I have ever known.

34:32.138 --> 34:34.418
You deserve to be an emperor.

34:41.018 --> 34:46.338
Unless the king falls,
the game doesn't end, Nikolas.

34:48.858 --> 34:53.418
And unless we get rid of all the pawns,
we can't reach the king.

34:54.778 --> 34:56.898
There is an order to it.

35:24.458 --> 35:25.938
Come on, men!

35:36.538 --> 35:38.738
This marketplace you took
from the Templars

35:38.858 --> 35:41.978
brought life to these lands, Ertuğrul Bey.

35:42.138 --> 35:43.858
Once we take the fortress,

35:43.978 --> 35:47.418
these lands will be
even more abundant, Abu Mansur.

35:53.738 --> 35:56.538
We took measure as per your orders, sir.

35:56.938 --> 35:58.498
Thank you, Turgut.

36:03.418 --> 36:06.578
Tell everyone in the market that
nobody is to open their shop.

36:08.938 --> 36:10.938
We'll have a meeting with the beys.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.938
-Yes, sir.
-Cabir.

36:23.698 --> 36:26.378
Sultan Alaeddin.

36:33.778 --> 36:35.338
Turgut, brother.

36:35.498 --> 36:36.578
Is my understanding correct?

36:36.858 --> 36:38.778
Did he literally close the market?

36:39.538 --> 36:41.698
All this for Abu Mansur?

36:43.058 --> 36:45.818
All Turkmen beys will have
a meeting tomorrow, Bamsi.

36:49.658 --> 36:54.498
He might have done all this
for the meeting.

36:56.538 --> 36:58.378
Let's hope for the best.

36:58.618 --> 37:00.058
Let's do that.

37:00.378 --> 37:02.058
I do hope so.

37:22.018 --> 37:23.658
Welcome, Your Highness.

37:23.818 --> 37:25.338
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

37:26.298 --> 37:29.858
Ertuğrul Bey, we cleared
the inn as per your orders.

37:30.178 --> 37:33.298
The travelers are placed in tents.

37:33.738 --> 37:39.418
Only Abu Mansur and His Highness
will stay at the inn.

37:40.458 --> 37:41.618
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

37:44.498 --> 37:45.978
Excuse me, sir.

38:11.458 --> 38:14.978
Let's meet at dinner to discuss
Karacahisar Fortress.

38:15.938 --> 38:18.658
I'll read the letters from Konya now.

38:24.138 --> 38:28.418
Ertuğrul Bey, we need to talk.

38:54.938 --> 38:58.178
I have time and again witnessed
how our sultan

38:58.338 --> 39:01.098
always makes the right decision,
Ertuğrul Bey.

39:02.178 --> 39:06.058
His wisdom and faith
protected our country.

39:06.178 --> 39:09.858
May God bestow him with a long life.

39:09.978 --> 39:11.218
Amen.

39:11.378 --> 39:14.538
However, I'm worried that

39:14.738 --> 39:17.818
the Karacahisar issue is left
upon your shoulders.

39:17.978 --> 39:19.978
Rest assured, Emir Sadettin,

39:20.658 --> 39:24.898
there will be a lot of Turkmen beys
along with their soldiers by my side.

39:26.018 --> 39:28.178
And you as well, as the sultan said.

39:28.378 --> 39:30.178
Right.

39:30.578 --> 39:32.898
Knowing you are with me gives me strength.

39:33.298 --> 39:35.898
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.

39:36.298 --> 39:40.058
I've known you
since the Battle of Kapetron.

39:41.738 --> 39:44.938
You have always been
this unfaltering and persistent.

39:47.258 --> 39:51.498
And look where you are now,
on our sultan's orders.

39:54.058 --> 39:58.258
You got that position by clawing
your way up.

39:59.298 --> 40:05.578
You may very well have deserved it,
but my worries still stand.

40:06.738 --> 40:10.378
You may voice your worries to our sultan
at dinner, Your Highness.

40:11.458 --> 40:16.098
Is it realistically possible to take
Karacahisar Fortress with a bunch of men?

40:17.858 --> 40:19.258
Assuming you take it,

40:20.218 --> 40:22.258
will the emperor stand still?

40:22.778 --> 40:26.778
What about the Latins?
Will they stand still?

40:27.498 --> 40:32.178
You might have convinced
our sultan with your ambition today.

40:32.538 --> 40:34.098
What about tomorrow?

40:34.738 --> 40:37.498
When all that I predict
starts coming true,

40:38.418 --> 40:41.898
will you stop to think how it will affect
our country?

40:42.498 --> 40:46.218
I've been thinking about it since the day
I came to Karacahisar.

40:46.818 --> 40:49.538
I've taken precautions all for this day.

40:49.978 --> 40:51.898
So, you are saying you won't back down?

40:52.258 --> 40:55.938
If the sultan decides so,
then our duty is to fight for it.

40:56.338 --> 40:57.778
Don't you worry.

40:57.978 --> 41:02.578
I'll pray for your safety
with all my heart.

41:03.498 --> 41:05.738
But I'll be watching you.

41:06.978 --> 41:08.378
That's fine by me.

41:38.698 --> 41:40.338
In the name of God,

41:40.938 --> 41:47.298
who wills things to existence
and fills our hearts with faith.

41:51.578 --> 41:53.418
Brave beys of the Cavdar tribe,

41:54.138 --> 41:59.738
Aliyar Bey served as bey honorably,
as it was his right.

42:00.538 --> 42:05.618
The passing of Aliyar Bey
deeply saddened us all.

42:06.098 --> 42:10.098
And many of our beys and
brave soldiers passed away, too.

42:10.218 --> 42:11.938
We are in a dire situation.

42:12.378 --> 42:16.578
How lucky they are to have been
worthy to be martyrs.

42:17.658 --> 42:23.138
We will not stop till God grants us
martyrdom as well.

42:23.538 --> 42:28.138
We will not deprive ourselves
with sadness and hopelessness.

42:28.778 --> 42:31.618
And there is no place in my tribe

42:32.098 --> 42:34.538
for those among you who are deprived.

42:35.058 --> 42:36.578
You better know that.

42:38.818 --> 42:42.018
For a thousand years,
we've always had a leader.

42:42.538 --> 42:47.698
And I'll not let this change
as long as I'm alive.

42:48.338 --> 42:50.818
Make no mistake.

42:51.098 --> 42:55.018
I'll carry out justice by the authority
my brother granted me.

42:55.658 --> 43:00.818
And those with reservations about it,
speak now.

43:01.338 --> 43:03.618
We have full confidence in you,
Aslıhan Hatun.

43:04.338 --> 43:07.138
Until we avenge my brother,

43:07.418 --> 43:10.138
I'll make the best of my authority.

43:11.058 --> 43:15.498
When we achieve our goal,
we will choose a bey for our tribe.

43:16.218 --> 43:20.938
And I'll be a soldier working
for my tribe till my last breath.

43:21.818 --> 43:25.138
What about your marriage
with Emir Sadettin, Aslıhan Hatun?

43:25.298 --> 43:27.978
My home is my marquee.

43:28.418 --> 43:30.698
Anything else is haram to me.

43:31.018 --> 43:32.858
You should know that.

43:35.698 --> 43:37.898
That's very becoming of you,
Aslıhan Hatun.

43:38.098 --> 43:40.738
May God grant us victory
over our enemies.

43:40.858 --> 43:42.218
Amen.

43:42.338 --> 43:43.458
Amen.

43:44.378 --> 43:46.658
We will hold a meeting tomorrow
at the inn.

43:47.298 --> 43:49.938
I, too, shall attend as the representative
of the Cavdars.

43:50.098 --> 43:54.178
Your attendance will give strength
to our tribe and honor our name.

43:54.338 --> 43:56.778
You have our full faith, Aslıhan Hatun.

43:58.098 --> 44:01.498
May this meeting benefit
our home and country.

44:02.258 --> 44:04.578
You walk the same path
as our late Aliyar Bey.

44:04.778 --> 44:06.098
We know that well.

44:07.578 --> 44:09.458
God bless you.

44:09.698 --> 44:10.858
Amen.

44:11.538 --> 44:14.978
May God help me carry
this authority with honor,

44:15.618 --> 44:18.018
and protect me from taking
rightful due of another.

44:18.258 --> 44:19.938
Amen.

44:56.498 --> 44:59.178
Today is a festival for all
of us, Vasilius.

45:03.538 --> 45:05.378
Did you see Abu Mansur?

45:06.498 --> 45:07.498
I did.

45:07.818 --> 45:12.058
They came to the inn after Aliyar's
funeral along with Ertuğrul and Sadettin.

45:12.898 --> 45:17.178
I saw that nobody could get close
to the inn without Ertuğrul's orders.

45:17.578 --> 45:20.258
Rooftops, the periphery
of the marketplace.

45:21.058 --> 45:23.938
Ertuğrul was meticulous
in taking all kinds of measures.

45:24.258 --> 45:25.698
Get to the point already.

45:26.178 --> 45:27.778
Who is all this measure for?

45:28.778 --> 45:30.578
Of course, it's for Sultan Alaeddin.

45:30.658 --> 45:32.258
Are you sure?

45:32.538 --> 45:34.178
As I'm sure of this hatred inside me.

45:34.498 --> 45:36.338
As I'm sure of the hatred inside you.

45:38.218 --> 45:41.818
Now you have given me
the whole wide world, Ekaterina.

45:43.018 --> 45:45.938
I dedicated myself to serving you,
Vasilius.

45:49.298 --> 45:50.338
To serve me?

45:58.538 --> 46:03.338
You will be repaid
for your services in kind.

46:19.018 --> 46:20.138
Power.

46:24.538 --> 46:25.658
Power.

46:30.538 --> 46:32.378
If it's not to take life,

46:34.258 --> 46:35.898
but to give life,

46:38.258 --> 46:39.898
then I am power.

46:42.258 --> 46:43.698
I am power.

46:57.418 --> 46:58.818
Ertuğrul.

47:00.818 --> 47:02.258
Ertuğrul.

47:07.858 --> 47:10.698
How did I put up with you for years?

47:12.858 --> 47:16.338
How could you get away
from the traps I laid for you?

47:20.778 --> 47:21.898
But it ends here.

47:24.258 --> 47:27.418
Now, nobody can save you.

47:29.178 --> 47:31.138
You will be crushed...

47:31.938 --> 47:35.378
under my power, which I used first
to give life and now to take it.

47:37.858 --> 47:39.898
You will not take this land that is...

47:41.178 --> 47:44.738
rightfully mine,
nor the sultan's trust in me,

47:46.698 --> 47:50.058
nor Aslıhan.

47:59.858 --> 48:05.218
The poison in my ring will slip away
to the sultan's food like a snake.

48:07.218 --> 48:10.818
Then, all your tantrums shall cease.

48:13.378 --> 48:15.738
And once I give the cure
in my other ring...

48:16.458 --> 48:18.218
to the sultan,

48:19.698 --> 48:21.858
he will be reborn.

48:24.498 --> 48:26.698
Once he regains his health,

48:26.978 --> 48:31.618
he will figure out the treason
that happened in your presence.

48:33.938 --> 48:35.498
However, you will...

48:36.338 --> 48:39.818
have been long dead, God willing.

48:43.538 --> 48:45.418
God willing.

48:53.858 --> 48:55.378
God willing.

49:09.538 --> 49:10.698
Greetings.

49:11.818 --> 49:13.338
Greetings.

49:13.778 --> 49:15.178
Bless you.

49:19.778 --> 49:21.138
Bless you.

49:30.458 --> 49:33.298
Brother, these men of Abu Mansur's

49:33.538 --> 49:35.578
are like the statues of the heathens.

49:36.058 --> 49:37.498
Did you see their wrists?

49:37.738 --> 49:39.858
They're like steel swords.

49:41.778 --> 49:44.338
Are you still calling him
a merchant, Bamsi?

49:45.298 --> 49:49.058
Thank God they are not the soldiers
of the heathens,

49:49.178 --> 49:51.858
or else they would give us
one hell of a time.

49:55.538 --> 49:59.378
Brother, what do you think Ertuğrul Bey

49:59.498 --> 50:02.138
will talk about with the Emir
and this Abu Mansur guy over dinner?

50:02.258 --> 50:04.018
Probably about the rugs.

50:05.058 --> 50:07.418
This new deal will give us relief,
hopefully.

50:08.738 --> 50:10.498
Easy now, Dündar Bey.

50:11.618 --> 50:13.298
There's something amiss here.

50:14.778 --> 50:16.458
I hope it's for the good, though.

50:17.418 --> 50:19.818
Speak of the devil, brother.

50:29.338 --> 50:31.898
Send for Ertuğrul Bey and Abu Mansur.

50:32.058 --> 50:33.538
I want them before me.

50:34.218 --> 50:35.658
They're talking...

50:38.298 --> 50:39.618
in the hall,

50:40.778 --> 50:42.098
Emir Sadettin.

50:58.978 --> 51:03.138
Brother, you know that I don't know
much about politics and all that.

51:03.378 --> 51:09.458
But do you think this so-called Emir
envies Ertuğrul Bey over Abu Mansur?

51:11.498 --> 51:14.258
It's not just envy, Bamsi.

51:14.698 --> 51:16.498
He looks like trouble, but...

51:16.898 --> 51:18.258
let's hope for the best.

51:25.858 --> 51:29.498
There are 11 big water wells
inside the fortress, Your Highness.

51:30.458 --> 51:34.898
Obviously, they won't need water
in case of a siege.

51:35.258 --> 51:36.698
Even if they have water,

51:36.978 --> 51:40.658
the supplies for their soldiers
will be insufficient, Your Highness.

51:41.738 --> 51:44.018
They can't find anything to eat.

51:45.258 --> 51:49.258
Since Vasilius ceased all trade
with the bazaar,

51:49.538 --> 51:54.098
he gets his supplies with the huge tax
he takes from the villagers.

51:54.818 --> 51:56.258
That's right, Your Highness.

52:00.098 --> 52:01.858
Come in, Sadettin.

52:12.018 --> 52:14.138
Listen to Ertuğrul Bey.

52:14.378 --> 52:19.618
He's giving us the intel on Karacahisar
that he has collected so far.

52:20.258 --> 52:22.378
It is extremely important.

52:22.538 --> 52:24.978
Many of his men died for this cause.

52:28.018 --> 52:30.378
That's Ertuğrul Bey's greatest strength.

52:32.138 --> 52:35.978
Once he sets his eyes on something,
he never lets go.

52:39.018 --> 52:43.618
If we can manage to corner Vasilius
in the fortress with a siege,

52:43.898 --> 52:48.138
we may be able to defeat them
with hunger, Your Highness.

52:49.378 --> 52:52.898
What happens if the emperor
sends reinforcements to the fortress?

52:53.818 --> 52:57.338
There are two roads leading
to Karacahisar from Nicaea, Your Highness.

52:57.618 --> 52:59.738
If we hold both roads,

53:00.138 --> 53:03.658
we can stop the soldiers coming from
Nicaea from reaching the fortress.

53:04.058 --> 53:09.818
The beys of Turkmen tribes and their men
will control both roads.

53:11.378 --> 53:15.738
Since my spy at Nicaea died,
there's no other way.

53:16.698 --> 53:20.658
We will bury Vasilius and his men alive

53:20.738 --> 53:23.698
in Karacahisar Fortress, Your Highness.

53:24.898 --> 53:28.018
We will fight to the last of our breath

53:28.338 --> 53:31.378
for Aliyar Bey and all the other martyrs.

53:31.738 --> 53:34.858
I have no doubt about it, Ertuğrul Bey.

53:35.978 --> 53:39.338
However, if the siege lasts longer
than expected,

53:39.578 --> 53:42.178
and the reinforcements the emperor sends
turn out to be strong,

53:42.858 --> 53:45.178
it will cause huge losses.

53:45.858 --> 53:46.898
In fact,

53:48.298 --> 53:50.738
it could be a disaster for Turkmen tribes.

53:58.698 --> 54:00.018
Let us eat.

54:14.978 --> 54:15.978
Sit.

54:26.498 --> 54:28.298
<i>Bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

54:41.978 --> 54:43.778
<i>Bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

54:56.578 --> 54:58.498
We will not siege the fortress,
Your Highness.

54:59.458 --> 55:03.978
Vasilius will choose to attack.

55:04.378 --> 55:08.058
I can say this because of the unit
that was coming from Nicaea.

55:08.658 --> 55:13.818
If your army doesn't come here,
they will attack us.

55:14.978 --> 55:17.458
And once he attacks us,

55:18.538 --> 55:20.858
he will have nowhere to run.

55:24.218 --> 55:26.498
So, once Vassileios gets out
of the fortress,

55:27.658 --> 55:30.018
you mean to fight him.

55:32.778 --> 55:35.938
We are waiting for the day
that we'll deliver his head

55:36.018 --> 55:38.018
to our sultan, Emir Sadettin.

56:34.458 --> 56:36.218
Thank God.

57:07.938 --> 57:08.818
Nikolas.

57:10.778 --> 57:12.218
Do you know how a raven...

57:12.858 --> 57:15.738
gets close to a carcass that he knows
is surrounded

57:15.858 --> 57:17.898
by stronger animals than him?

57:18.378 --> 57:19.298
How?

57:19.938 --> 57:21.898
By causing an uproar.

57:22.538 --> 57:24.898
By distracting the animals around it.

57:28.178 --> 57:29.778
It's a jealous bird.

57:31.018 --> 57:33.138
It doesn't want to share his prey.

57:34.178 --> 57:36.578
And if his prey were to get away,

57:38.418 --> 57:39.738
that small, pitch-black raven...

57:40.658 --> 57:45.458
with a rugged caw turns into a monster.

57:47.338 --> 57:49.178
You don't mean Ertuğrul.

57:52.458 --> 57:53.778
It's Emir Sadettin.

57:55.698 --> 57:57.338
He couldn't deal with Ertuğrul.

57:57.978 --> 58:02.338
And now, the sultan is his guest.
Look at that.

58:04.258 --> 58:06.098
I'm sure that the sultan

58:07.098 --> 58:10.738
will give Ertuğrul something that will
make Emir Sadettin jealous.

58:12.698 --> 58:15.298
Emir Sadettin will not like that at all.

58:16.218 --> 58:18.098
So, out of jealousy, he will
cause an uproar, huh?

58:18.858 --> 58:20.898
Just like a raven.

58:21.298 --> 58:23.298
And we will take advantage of that.

58:24.538 --> 58:27.178
If Emir Sadettin is as clever
as you make him out to be,

58:27.458 --> 58:28.898
then he will make it easier for us.

58:31.738 --> 58:32.938
But what?

58:34.538 --> 58:36.178
What could he do?

58:38.458 --> 58:41.138
I don't care. He can do whatever he wants.

58:45.018 --> 58:46.378
Victory shall be ours.

59:01.306 --> 59:03.546
What do you think about it, Sadettin?

59:06.426 --> 59:09.586
I know Vasilius well, Your Highness.

59:10.586 --> 59:13.186
Ertuğrul Bey is quite right.

59:15.186 --> 59:18.226
He is blinded by his desire
to spill Turk blood.

59:18.626 --> 59:20.506
Out of his hatred for the Turks,

59:20.706 --> 59:22.346
he will prowl out of his fortress...

59:23.226 --> 59:26.026
like the dog he is,

59:26.466 --> 59:29.226
and find something to bite.

59:31.106 --> 59:33.306
Along with his treachery.

59:40.586 --> 59:42.066
Are you all right, Your Highness?

59:42.826 --> 59:44.626
Do you need water?

59:57.146 --> 59:58.226
Your Highness...

01:00:16.586 --> 01:00:17.626
Your Highness...

01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:24.866
He's been poisoned.

01:00:25.826 --> 01:00:27.626
Our sultan has been poisoned.

01:00:28.186 --> 01:00:30.426
Quick! Call the doctors!

01:00:30.546 --> 01:00:31.546
Quick!

01:00:32.986 --> 01:00:34.786
What's the meaning of this,
Emir Sadettin?

01:00:35.986 --> 01:00:39.866
It's on you
to answer that question, not me.

01:00:40.786 --> 01:00:41.946
What's happening here?

01:00:42.106 --> 01:00:43.666
What's the meaning of this?

01:00:44.426 --> 01:00:47.746
I know you are panicked
but watch your mouth, Emir Sadettin.

01:00:49.626 --> 01:00:52.866
Guards! Take Ertuğrul Bey's
sword from him.

01:00:55.226 --> 01:00:56.266
Come on!

01:01:03.106 --> 01:01:04.186
Arrest him.

01:01:04.586 --> 01:01:08.346
Give your sword to the guard, Ertuğrul.

01:01:10.746 --> 01:01:13.386
What do you think you are doing,
Emir Sadettin?

01:01:19.866 --> 01:01:21.986
-Make way.
-Is he all right?

01:01:22.066 --> 01:01:23.306
What are you doing?

01:01:23.866 --> 01:01:25.506
What's going on, Your Highness?

01:01:25.906 --> 01:01:27.386
Abu Mansur has been poisoned.

01:01:29.906 --> 01:01:31.226
Take him to his room.

01:01:31.786 --> 01:01:32.826
Come on!

01:01:54.306 --> 01:01:57.066
Throw Ertuğrul Bey in jail.

01:01:59.386 --> 01:02:00.946
What did you say, Your Highness?

01:02:01.386 --> 01:02:04.426
Why would he poison the man
that saved his life?

01:02:10.186 --> 01:02:13.586
Have the Kayi alps leave this place.

01:02:14.026 --> 01:02:16.186
They shall go back to their tribe.

01:02:19.706 --> 01:02:24.586
Your Highness, let me put my skills
as a doctor into good use.

01:02:25.226 --> 01:02:27.986
Abu Mansur has his own doctor.

01:02:28.186 --> 01:02:30.546
He'll take care of him.

01:02:31.146 --> 01:02:34.426
Now, leave this place at once.

01:02:36.266 --> 01:02:37.146
Go!

01:03:07.546 --> 01:03:08.586
Be quick.

01:03:08.866 --> 01:03:10.386
We must make him vomit.

01:03:11.906 --> 01:03:14.266
Your Highness! Your Highness!

01:03:16.946 --> 01:03:19.706
How could you be so stupid,
Emir Sadettin?

01:03:20.426 --> 01:03:23.186
How could you be fooled like this?

01:03:25.546 --> 01:03:27.666
We won't let you take my brother!

01:03:40.386 --> 01:03:44.826
Ertuğrul Bey, calm yourself
and have your men put away their weapons.

01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:47.226
I don't want any bloodshed between us.

01:03:50.786 --> 01:03:51.706
Surrender!

01:03:58.746 --> 01:04:01.426
Dündar Bey, Artuk Bey.

01:04:03.186 --> 01:04:05.066
Take the men and go back to the camp.

01:04:07.066 --> 01:04:09.826
Let everybody at the camp
know what happened here.

01:04:11.906 --> 01:04:13.906
Sir. Sir!

01:04:15.186 --> 01:04:17.586
Let us stay with you.

01:04:19.346 --> 01:04:22.666
How could we just leave you here?

01:04:23.746 --> 01:04:25.986
What's happening here, sir?

01:04:26.146 --> 01:04:28.826
Who are these men?
Who is this Abu Mansur?

01:04:31.226 --> 01:04:34.466
Leave now if you don't want bloodshed.

01:04:37.786 --> 01:04:38.746
Turgut.

01:04:48.106 --> 01:04:49.106
Let's go!

01:05:11.546 --> 01:05:14.066
Surrender your weapon.

01:05:33.426 --> 01:05:34.506
Take him.

01:05:38.946 --> 01:05:41.146
What kind of treachery is this?

01:05:41.906 --> 01:05:44.786
You are being played off against me.

01:05:47.066 --> 01:05:50.546
Pray that this doesn't turn out
to be on you.

01:05:52.186 --> 01:05:55.866
Because if it is,
you shall die a terrible death.

01:05:59.946 --> 01:06:00.986
Take him!

01:06:27.906 --> 01:06:28.866
Bamsi.

01:06:32.026 --> 01:06:34.306
Calm down. Bamsi.

01:06:34.626 --> 01:06:37.346
Let's calm down
and think of our next move.

01:06:37.746 --> 01:06:39.466
We know what we must do, Artuk Bey.

01:06:40.426 --> 01:06:41.866
We must save Ertuğrul Bey.

01:06:43.746 --> 01:06:46.826
Samsa, inform the Cavdar Tribe fast.

01:06:47.026 --> 01:06:49.186
Tell Aslıhan Hatun to come
to the Kayi Tribe.

01:06:49.426 --> 01:06:50.746
All right, Artuk Bey.

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:53.106
Men! Come with me.

01:06:53.386 --> 01:06:54.506
Come on.

01:06:57.546 --> 01:07:00.946
We will call the beys going
to the meeting to Kayi Tribe,

01:07:01.146 --> 01:07:03.626
else we won't be able to
fend off this trouble.

01:07:03.866 --> 01:07:06.626
Why would Ertuğrul Bey
want to kill a merchant?

01:07:07.506 --> 01:07:10.946
Nobody would be fooled by that lie.
All the beys will support us.

01:07:11.066 --> 01:07:15.626
Yes, I know that everybody knows,
but Emir Sadettin would not get it.

01:07:15.706 --> 01:07:19.546
Our bey has been an ally
to Emir Sadettin for so long.

01:07:20.266 --> 01:07:22.946
What issue could he have with our bey?

01:07:23.186 --> 01:07:25.306
Good faith may cause
ill-fate sometimes, Bamsi.

01:07:25.706 --> 01:07:27.546
Emir Sadettin is after something.

01:07:28.026 --> 01:07:31.586
Artuk Bey, something I don't understand
is going on.

01:07:31.706 --> 01:07:35.066
Who on earth is this guy
called Abu Mansur?

01:07:35.506 --> 01:07:38.386
Plus, why is Emir Sadettin
head over heels for this guy?

01:07:38.706 --> 01:07:41.106
We will find out everything, Bamsi.

01:07:41.426 --> 01:07:42.546
Yes, we will.

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:44.146
We will.

01:08:16.906 --> 01:08:18.786
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:08:26.386 --> 01:08:27.746
Throw it all up, Your Highness.

01:08:31.186 --> 01:08:32.506
O, the one who cures!

01:08:35.026 --> 01:08:36.666
O, the one who cures!

01:08:49.866 --> 01:08:50.746
It's...

01:08:50.866 --> 01:08:52.546
It's poison.

01:08:53.306 --> 01:08:54.306
God.

01:08:55.146 --> 01:08:59.026
On the honor of your name, help us,
o, one who cures.

01:09:00.066 --> 01:09:02.066
This is not good.

01:09:22.546 --> 01:09:26.706
God sent us this trouble,
but he sent us our remedy, as well.

01:09:26.826 --> 01:09:28.066
God bless.

01:09:29.346 --> 01:09:31.186
Thank God. God bless.

01:09:41.546 --> 01:09:42.626
<i>Bismillah.</i>

01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:08.746
Healer.

01:10:09.386 --> 01:10:10.666
How is our sultan?

01:10:10.946 --> 01:10:13.066
He's not okay, Your Highness.

01:10:13.186 --> 01:10:14.906
I'm trying to empty his stomach.

01:10:22.746 --> 01:10:23.866
Water.

01:10:24.066 --> 01:10:25.586
Let me do it.

01:10:25.666 --> 01:10:27.266
Take this out of here.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:51.026
Your Highness.

01:11:01.426 --> 01:11:03.106
What are you standing around for?

01:11:14.586 --> 01:11:15.946
I don't know what's happening.

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:17.906
I have no idea what he was poisoned with.

01:11:18.026 --> 01:11:21.186
He's in a critical condition.
We're losing him.

01:11:36.386 --> 01:11:38.146
<i>-As salaam wa alaikum.</i>
<i>-Wa alaikum as salaam.</i>

01:11:38.626 --> 01:11:39.866
What's all the fuss?

01:11:40.106 --> 01:11:42.106
You were sent by God, sir.

01:11:42.266 --> 01:11:45.106
We are in huge trouble, Ibn Arabi.

01:11:45.346 --> 01:11:47.826
The merchant Abu Mansur was poisoned.

01:11:48.586 --> 01:11:50.466
The emir holds our bey responsible.

01:11:52.346 --> 01:11:56.986
You saved Ertuğrul Bey from poison once.

01:11:57.226 --> 01:12:01.066
We have faith that you will save us
from this false accusation, as well.

01:12:03.746 --> 01:12:06.746
Artuk Bey, fate protects
the man from death.

01:12:07.586 --> 01:12:09.186
Our duty is...

01:12:10.506 --> 01:12:15.186
to intervene to protect the man
from the grasp of his fate.

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.946
Let me see Abu Mansur immediately.

01:12:33.946 --> 01:12:37.066
Where do you think you are going?
The emir's orders are absolute.

01:12:37.306 --> 01:12:41.506
All right, we won't pass.
It's just Ibn Arabi.

01:12:41.826 --> 01:12:45.106
I said nobody goes in! Are you daft?
Go back to your tribe.

01:12:47.666 --> 01:12:49.706
Do you think we would let
our bey die in your hands?

01:13:27.586 --> 01:13:30.626
We've done as you said up until now.

01:13:32.226 --> 01:13:33.386
However,

01:13:34.346 --> 01:13:36.466
you will let Ibn Arabi in...

01:13:37.466 --> 01:13:39.466
if you want Abu Mansur to live.

01:13:45.666 --> 01:13:47.786
Either he enters in one piece,

01:13:48.426 --> 01:13:51.466
or nobody leaves here in one piece!

01:14:03.026 --> 01:14:04.746
What's all this fuss?

01:14:05.746 --> 01:14:08.866
Don't you see that they are
disobeying the orders of the emir?

01:14:15.746 --> 01:14:19.946
All we want is for Ibn Arabi
to cure Abu Mansur.

01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:21.706
Let him in.

01:14:28.986 --> 01:14:30.306
Follow me, Ibn Arabi, sir.

01:14:32.986 --> 01:14:35.866
Are you going against his orders, too?

01:14:38.186 --> 01:14:41.466
I only follow Abu Mansur's orders.

01:14:41.706 --> 01:14:42.706
Make way!

01:14:51.866 --> 01:14:53.346
Go ahead, Ibn Arabi, sir.

01:15:06.146 --> 01:15:07.226
Stand down!

01:15:17.906 --> 01:15:18.906
Bamsi.

01:15:28.466 --> 01:15:32.226
Bamsi, gather the men
who were guarding the inn.

01:15:32.466 --> 01:15:34.266
Hide somewhere close.

01:15:34.586 --> 01:15:36.546
Wait for my orders.

01:15:36.946 --> 01:15:38.346
There will be chaos.

01:15:39.226 --> 01:15:42.386
-We can't leave our bey alone.
-Right on, brother.

01:15:43.266 --> 01:15:45.146
We will do anything for our bey.

01:15:45.346 --> 01:15:47.546
And if we must die for his sake,

01:15:48.746 --> 01:15:50.386
then die we shall.

01:16:08.306 --> 01:16:10.146
<i>Don't worry, Your Highness.</i>

01:16:11.146 --> 01:16:13.986
<i>Our country will be safe.</i>

01:16:14.826 --> 01:16:19.346
<i>Emir Sadettin will fill the gap</i>
<i>left behind by you.</i>

01:16:33.186 --> 01:16:35.466
Did I not order you to not let anybody in?

01:16:35.666 --> 01:16:36.746
Emir Sadettin.

01:16:37.306 --> 01:16:40.306
Ibn Arabi has come to cure our sultan.

01:16:43.026 --> 01:16:45.466
He has his own healer.

01:16:45.906 --> 01:16:47.906
But his hands are tied.

01:16:48.026 --> 01:16:49.906
Arabi is Ertuğrul's man.

01:16:54.266 --> 01:16:55.946
Why would I trust him?

01:16:58.546 --> 01:17:00.026
Take him away.

01:17:00.106 --> 01:17:01.346
Your Highness.

01:17:02.666 --> 01:17:05.066
If the high state officials find out

01:17:05.186 --> 01:17:07.746
that you turned him away
at such a crucial time,

01:17:08.146 --> 01:17:11.106
they will put all of us
in a grave, along with our sultan.

01:17:12.986 --> 01:17:14.186
And you'll go down first.

01:17:19.586 --> 01:17:20.586
You...

01:17:21.826 --> 01:17:24.666
dare threaten me?

01:17:27.946 --> 01:17:31.106
I dedicated my life to the sultan.

01:17:31.586 --> 01:17:34.306
I do as my duty calls.

01:17:34.946 --> 01:17:39.226
If need be,
I'd gladly surrender my life for him.

01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.026
Emir Sadettin.

01:17:46.146 --> 01:17:48.426
If it's in his fate,

01:17:49.386 --> 01:17:51.706
let alone such a miserable man as me,

01:17:51.906 --> 01:17:56.306
nobody would be able to save
our sultan from his fate.

01:17:57.106 --> 01:17:58.626
However,

01:17:59.106 --> 01:18:01.866
you will nonetheless
be remembered as the man

01:18:02.106 --> 01:18:03.306
who obstructed me.

01:18:45.146 --> 01:18:47.906
If His Highness dies,

01:18:50.786 --> 01:18:52.626
I'll kill you with my own hands.

01:19:07.946 --> 01:19:08.946
Go ahead.

01:19:21.866 --> 01:19:23.106
How is his condition?

01:19:23.866 --> 01:19:25.946
It's still bad, Your Highness.

01:19:28.706 --> 01:19:30.746
Let Ibn Arabi handle this.

01:19:44.866 --> 01:19:46.266
What have you tried?

01:19:46.346 --> 01:19:48.786
I tried to empty his stomach,
but it was to no avail.

01:19:48.986 --> 01:19:50.626
I don't understand what’s happening.

01:20:01.466 --> 01:20:03.626
Don't take your eyes off him.

01:20:04.106 --> 01:20:06.226
As you wish, Your Highness.

01:20:11.586 --> 01:20:14.986
Give me a cup. Let's check his blood.

01:20:15.266 --> 01:20:16.386
Right away.

01:21:17.866 --> 01:21:21.426
Get me the herbs I'm about to list,
chief physician.

01:21:43.626 --> 01:21:45.106
<i>Bismillah.</i>

01:21:56.146 --> 01:21:57.866
My sweet son.

01:22:04.226 --> 01:22:05.706
May I enter, Mother?

01:22:06.986 --> 01:22:08.466
Come in, son.

01:22:10.786 --> 01:22:13.746
Mother, I have bad news.

01:22:15.906 --> 01:22:19.106
What bad news? This is going to kill me.

01:22:19.466 --> 01:22:21.866
Abu Mansur was poisoned at the inn.

01:22:22.746 --> 01:22:27.306
He was alive when we left,
but his condition is still critical.

01:22:29.386 --> 01:22:34.106
Emir Sadettin
holds Ertuğrul Bey responsible.

01:22:34.466 --> 01:22:36.546
He took him captive.

01:22:36.626 --> 01:22:37.626
Oh, no!

01:22:41.106 --> 01:22:42.106
Mother!

01:22:43.466 --> 01:22:44.946
What do we do?

01:22:46.106 --> 01:22:48.866
Emir Sadettin had all of us
leave the inn.

01:22:50.066 --> 01:22:52.306
We informed the beys that were
invited to the meeting.

01:22:52.786 --> 01:22:55.066
We will meet at our marquee tomorrow.

01:22:55.466 --> 01:22:57.826
Aslıhan Hatun is on her way as well.

01:22:58.466 --> 01:23:01.386
It'll mean Ertuğrul Bey's death
if something happens to the sultan.

01:23:13.666 --> 01:23:15.026
Did you say "sultan"?

01:23:15.706 --> 01:23:17.586
Abu Mansur is the sultan?

01:23:21.666 --> 01:23:24.626
How is that even possible?

01:23:30.546 --> 01:23:31.946
Abu Mansur

01:23:33.226 --> 01:23:35.786
is Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad.

01:23:41.746 --> 01:23:44.066
He came in disguise.

01:23:44.426 --> 01:23:46.466
But keep this a secret.

01:23:46.906 --> 01:23:50.346
Don't let anybody else know.

01:23:52.866 --> 01:23:55.906
This explains all the fuss.

01:23:58.306 --> 01:24:03.666
Pity that I had to meet
with our sultan in such dire times.

01:24:05.026 --> 01:24:07.906
God bless him.

01:24:12.946 --> 01:24:16.026
Ertuğrul Bey won't be able to
get out of this alone.

01:24:16.346 --> 01:24:17.706
What do you mean "alone"?

01:24:17.986 --> 01:24:21.426
We are with him, son.
All the other beys will stand by his side.

01:24:22.146 --> 01:24:23.146
Right.

01:24:25.466 --> 01:24:29.386
Mother, the sultan must live,

01:24:30.106 --> 01:24:32.266
or else Ertuğrul Bey will...

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:43.186
This misunderstanding will right itself.

01:24:44.026 --> 01:24:47.066
My son would never do something like that.

01:24:50.706 --> 01:24:56.586
What is worse is
if something were to happen to the sultan,

01:24:57.546 --> 01:24:59.586
then our country would be in danger.

01:25:07.746 --> 01:25:08.746
Artuk Bey.

01:25:09.946 --> 01:25:10.946
Tomorrow,

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:14.066
we will gather the Turkmen beys
and explain the situation.

01:25:14.866 --> 01:25:17.306
We will make for the inn together.

01:25:18.026 --> 01:25:21.786
And whoever did this,
or put this on my son,

01:25:21.906 --> 01:25:24.066
we will call them to account for it.

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:29.906
Artuk Bey, you and Dündar
will stay with the tribe.

01:25:30.426 --> 01:25:33.306
If something happens to Ertuğrul or us,

01:25:33.746 --> 01:25:35.746
you will lead our tribe.

01:25:36.226 --> 01:25:38.146
-Mother.
-Dündar!

01:25:38.946 --> 01:25:40.386
You are a bey.

01:25:41.466 --> 01:25:45.426
You are the leader
when Ertuğrul is not here.

01:25:46.866 --> 01:25:50.946
Don't you worry, Hayme Hatun.
Leave it to us.

01:26:31.306 --> 01:26:32.626
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim</i>.

01:27:23.866 --> 01:27:25.186
Can you excuse us?

01:27:28.026 --> 01:27:30.386
I presume you are wise enough to know

01:27:30.666 --> 01:27:35.186
what will happen
if you let our sultan die.

01:27:36.266 --> 01:27:40.866
Your Highness, we must do
as Ibn Arabi says.

01:29:24.106 --> 01:29:27.306
<i>Gather them, Your Highness.</i>
<i>Gather all seven of the fruits.</i>

01:29:28.066 --> 01:29:31.186
<i>Gather them in the name of God,</i>
<i>who gives life.</i>

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:34.466
<i>Gather them in the name of him</i>
<i>who cures the sick.</i>

01:29:37.346 --> 01:29:42.146
<i>For God is close,</i>
<i>and answers our prayers.</i>

01:29:42.226 --> 01:29:43.986
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

01:29:44.586 --> 01:29:46.746
<i>I can't bear it any longer.</i>

01:29:48.106 --> 01:29:51.226
<i>God's decision will reveal itself soon.</i>
<i>Endure.</i>

01:30:24.306 --> 01:30:27.346
<i>Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyoom.</i>

01:30:27.786 --> 01:30:31.106
<i>Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyoom.</i>

01:30:32.066 --> 01:30:35.266
<i>Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyoom.</i>

01:30:36.066 --> 01:30:38.666
<i>Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyoom.</i>

01:30:39.106 --> 01:30:41.906
<i>Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyoom.</i>

01:30:42.026 --> 01:30:45.066
<i>Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyoom.</i>

01:30:56.746 --> 01:30:59.986
More trouble has landed on Ertuğrul
before he could even see his child.

01:31:13.346 --> 01:31:15.866
Greater mists fall on great mountains,
my dear.

01:31:16.306 --> 01:31:21.546
Ertuğrul has many enemies,
but he has just as many friends.

01:31:22.226 --> 01:31:24.506
Don't you worry.

01:31:29.106 --> 01:31:30.106
Mother.

01:31:30.946 --> 01:31:32.306
-My dear.
-Halime Sultan.

01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:33.386
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:31:33.466 --> 01:31:35.586
Mother, what happened?

01:31:36.546 --> 01:31:39.386
This is just a test, dear.

01:31:40.466 --> 01:31:43.666
Why would Ertuğrul Bey
poison the merchant that he works with?

01:31:46.906 --> 01:31:49.146
He is no merchant, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:31:51.746 --> 01:31:53.746
He is Sultan Alaeddin.

01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:05.186
What...

01:32:06.626 --> 01:32:08.426
What did you say, Halime?

01:32:10.706 --> 01:32:11.706
Mother.

01:32:15.346 --> 01:32:19.466
No! It's worse than I thought.

01:32:20.146 --> 01:32:24.586
The welfare of our country and
Ertuğrul Bey's life are both in danger.

01:32:25.866 --> 01:32:28.786
How could you not recognize him, Halime?

01:32:30.066 --> 01:32:33.146
I saw him once when I was
imprisoned many years ago.

01:32:34.426 --> 01:32:36.866
We had to run away with my father.

01:32:38.306 --> 01:32:43.226
I felt I recognized him at first,
but it took time to remember.

01:32:58.066 --> 01:33:02.146
Whoever is behind this,
he is wise enough

01:33:02.706 --> 01:33:05.666
to get a thousand birds with one stone.

01:33:36.426 --> 01:33:38.626
Little by little you took away my dreams.

01:33:40.306 --> 01:33:42.946
Little by little you took away
those I loved,

01:33:44.386 --> 01:33:46.586
and left me begging to the traitors.

01:33:49.106 --> 01:33:50.866
Left me as a slave to the enemy.

01:33:56.666 --> 01:33:58.746
Look at you, Colpan.

01:33:59.866 --> 01:34:01.986
You were Nicaea's princess once.

01:34:02.666 --> 01:34:04.866
You became the sultan of the Cavdars.

01:34:06.786 --> 01:34:09.546
And now, you are trapped
in the fortress of these bastards

01:34:09.746 --> 01:34:11.826
with a baby in your womb.

01:34:15.186 --> 01:34:16.626
Ekaterina.

01:34:16.786 --> 01:34:18.226
Come in, Vasilius.

01:34:29.426 --> 01:34:31.226
I have good news for you.

01:34:34.226 --> 01:34:35.226
You

01:34:36.106 --> 01:34:39.186
have given me the chance
I've been looking for all this time.

01:34:41.106 --> 01:34:43.706
The chance to destroy all my enemies.

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:46.666
Tomorrow...

01:34:47.626 --> 01:34:49.986
they will all die.

01:34:51.946 --> 01:34:55.386
So, you will avenge my baby's father
before he is even born?

01:34:57.786 --> 01:35:00.546
We will avenge you.

01:35:04.066 --> 01:35:08.346
When your child grows up,
he will see what you have accomplished

01:35:08.746 --> 01:35:11.306
and be proud of you, Ekaterina.

01:35:11.826 --> 01:35:13.546
They'll both be proud of you.

01:35:54.906 --> 01:35:57.786
The sultan was poisoned at your inn.

01:35:58.866 --> 01:36:00.706
Even that shame is enough for you.

01:36:00.906 --> 01:36:04.026
Is there any use in me killing you?

01:36:07.026 --> 01:36:12.706
Pray that Arabi saves our sultan
as he saved you.

01:36:18.706 --> 01:36:21.226
He will, should God allow it.

01:36:28.906 --> 01:36:31.826
I can see in your eyes the hatred
you feel toward me, Emir Sadettin.

01:36:35.146 --> 01:36:39.866
You very well know that
I did not poison him.

01:36:41.146 --> 01:36:43.026
The hatred in you...

01:36:43.706 --> 01:36:48.466
became clear when our sultan
appointed me as the margrave.

01:36:49.666 --> 01:36:56.226
What would an Emir of the Seljuks,
such as I, ever hope to gain

01:36:57.626 --> 01:37:00.506
from a margrave, such as yourself?

01:37:00.586 --> 01:37:02.426
What could I want from you?

01:37:03.506 --> 01:37:07.346
You poison everybody around you, right?

01:37:10.866 --> 01:37:13.146
And not just our sultan.

01:37:13.786 --> 01:37:15.786
Who do you mean, Emir Sadettin?

01:37:15.946 --> 01:37:18.426
You poisoned Aslıhan with your ambitions.

01:37:21.706 --> 01:37:23.786
Are you aware of what you are saying?

01:37:26.186 --> 01:37:28.906
Aslıhan refused to be my wife.

01:37:30.586 --> 01:37:31.586
Why?

01:37:32.186 --> 01:37:33.346
Just why?

01:37:41.746 --> 01:37:43.266
Because of you.

01:37:43.666 --> 01:37:47.546
Yes, all because of you.

01:37:49.026 --> 01:37:50.826
She said something about
leading her tribe

01:37:51.066 --> 01:37:53.906
and carrying out the responsibilities
left by Aliyar Bey.

01:37:54.186 --> 01:37:57.386
And that she'd dedicate her life
to her tribe.

01:38:00.986 --> 01:38:01.986
And why is that?

01:38:03.066 --> 01:38:04.586
Because of you.

01:38:04.826 --> 01:38:07.826
She said you'd always be with her,

01:38:08.026 --> 01:38:11.986
and that you'd protect her and her tribe.

01:38:17.746 --> 01:38:19.066
What about me?

01:38:24.786 --> 01:38:28.786
You took the woman I fell in love with
away from me.

01:38:31.226 --> 01:38:36.226
I curse the day you came
to these lands, Ertuğrul.

01:38:37.426 --> 01:38:39.026
Emir Sadettin.

01:38:40.626 --> 01:38:43.146
Even if she loved you,

01:38:44.386 --> 01:38:46.986
she wouldn't leave her tribe.

01:38:48.386 --> 01:38:50.066
That gallant woman...

01:38:51.146 --> 01:38:54.586
wouldn't hesitate to sacrifice
her life for her tribe.

01:38:55.786 --> 01:38:58.226
If you really loved her,

01:38:59.946 --> 01:39:01.426
you'd be proud of her.

01:39:03.226 --> 01:39:04.866
You'd support her decision.

01:39:08.666 --> 01:39:10.986
Yours is nothing but obstinacy.

01:39:11.866 --> 01:39:14.106
The fact that she refused you...

01:39:15.066 --> 01:39:16.666
hurts your pride.

01:39:19.946 --> 01:39:21.786
This is the truth.

01:39:32.506 --> 01:39:35.186
Do you think I don't know that...

01:39:37.426 --> 01:39:39.226
she once loved you?

01:39:46.626 --> 01:39:47.586
Open!

01:40:43.891 --> 01:40:45.331
Governor Vasilius!

01:41:12.051 --> 01:41:13.011
Power...

01:41:16.771 --> 01:41:17.771
courage...

01:41:24.491 --> 01:41:25.771
and faith.

01:41:29.771 --> 01:41:33.011
These virtues are inherent

01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:37.171
only to the most honorable soldiers
of noble descent.

01:41:38.051 --> 01:41:39.611
You are all such soldiers.

01:41:43.811 --> 01:41:44.771
Fear...

01:41:48.571 --> 01:41:49.651
weakness...

01:41:52.891 --> 01:41:55.051
and vulnerability.

01:41:58.491 --> 01:41:59.651
These, on the other hand...

01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:05.051
are inherent flaws of those
stupid enough to face you brave soldiers.

01:42:06.251 --> 01:42:08.091
You will face such men.

01:42:09.011 --> 01:42:10.051
My men!

01:42:10.771 --> 01:42:14.651
This is the day we have always dreamed of.

01:42:16.011 --> 01:42:20.291
This is the day we bring honor
to our glorious history.

01:42:21.811 --> 01:42:24.011
This is the day they will sing our songs,

01:42:25.571 --> 01:42:28.491
and we will be the talk
of the whole wide world.

01:42:29.251 --> 01:42:30.211
Now,

01:42:31.531 --> 01:42:35.651
either we become a part of this victory
and live an honorable life,

01:42:36.491 --> 01:42:39.571
or we fight and die

01:42:39.851 --> 01:42:42.011
with our honor intact,

01:42:42.371 --> 01:42:45.891
and embrace the promise of heaven.

01:42:46.691 --> 01:42:49.051
This is our last war.

01:42:50.011 --> 01:42:52.211
We will protect the last fortress

01:42:52.411 --> 01:42:55.051
of our civilization until our last breath.

01:42:55.251 --> 01:42:56.851
Long live Nicaea!

01:42:57.291 --> 01:43:03.251
Long live Nicaea!

01:43:03.331 --> 01:43:08.611
Long live Nicaea!

01:43:08.691 --> 01:43:14.491
Long live Nicaea!

01:43:17.731 --> 01:43:18.731
Attention!

01:43:53.611 --> 01:43:55.851
Ertuğrul Bey, son of Suleyman Shah,

01:43:56.931 --> 01:44:02.971
has always followed his faith,
his country and his traditions.

01:44:04.851 --> 01:44:10.371
He protected all of you, risking his life.

01:44:17.931 --> 01:44:19.691
Now it's your turn.

01:44:20.571 --> 01:44:24.011
Ertuğrul Bey was put
in a difficult position

01:44:24.331 --> 01:44:26.011
due to a disastrous incident.

01:44:27.011 --> 01:44:29.451
Hayme Hatun, tell us what the problem is.

01:44:29.531 --> 01:44:31.571
We'd gladly lay down
our lives for Ertuğrul Bey.

01:44:32.691 --> 01:44:33.691
I know you would.

01:44:34.611 --> 01:44:38.651
That's why I'm holding this meeting.

01:44:40.931 --> 01:44:42.731
The Sultan

01:44:43.531 --> 01:44:45.931
Alaeddin Kayqubad

01:44:46.571 --> 01:44:50.651
has been staying in our tribe
as Ertuğrul Bey's guest

01:44:51.291 --> 01:44:52.731
for a while now.

01:44:53.531 --> 01:44:54.891
God bless.

01:44:54.971 --> 01:44:57.131
-What an honor!
-God bless. Such a pleasing thing.

01:44:57.291 --> 01:44:59.851
Mother Hayme, what an honor
it is for our Sultan to visit you.

01:45:00.451 --> 01:45:01.811
I wish we could have seen him.

01:45:02.211 --> 01:45:04.411
-What an honor!
-Listen now.

01:45:05.571 --> 01:45:08.491
His Highness Alaeddin Kayqubad

01:45:09.011 --> 01:45:13.811
was poisoned by someone
at the Hanlı Bazaar yesterday.

01:45:14.371 --> 01:45:19.571
-Who could have done this?
-Who dared to poison him?

01:45:19.811 --> 01:45:22.011
How could they do it?
How is that possible?

01:45:22.131 --> 01:45:24.531
Who would attempt something like that?

01:45:25.171 --> 01:45:30.891
This was pinned on Ertuğrul Bey
on a baseless claim.

01:45:32.051 --> 01:45:33.371
It's a smear attempt.

01:45:34.091 --> 01:45:37.171
He's charged with poisoning
his very own Sultan.

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:41.291
That can't be!
Ertuğrul Bey would never do that.

01:45:43.971 --> 01:45:47.691
This is not a simple coincidence.

01:45:48.371 --> 01:45:50.211
It was thought out well.

01:45:52.091 --> 01:45:54.931
We must put an end
to this baseless lie before it's too late.

01:45:56.771 --> 01:46:01.171
That's why, if we don't stand
by Ertuğrul Bey now,

01:46:01.891 --> 01:46:03.051
he will be in grave danger.

01:46:03.571 --> 01:46:05.891
Let's go and rescue him.

01:46:06.691 --> 01:46:08.451
Let's do whatever we can, Hayme Hatun.

01:46:09.171 --> 01:46:10.251
We shall go.

01:46:10.891 --> 01:46:12.131
Emir Sadettin

01:46:12.731 --> 01:46:14.491
took Ertuğrul Bey captive, and he is...

01:46:15.891 --> 01:46:18.011
after a summary execution.

01:46:19.371 --> 01:46:21.331
We will never let that happen.

01:46:21.771 --> 01:46:24.291
Never!

01:46:26.131 --> 01:46:27.571
Either we save both my son

01:46:28.491 --> 01:46:29.771
and our Sultan

01:46:30.531 --> 01:46:33.251
from this pit of hell...

01:46:34.971 --> 01:46:39.571
or we will all be consumed
by this disaster.

01:46:40.331 --> 01:46:43.971
What are we waiting for, Mother Hayme?
We will stand by Ertuğrul Bey forever.

01:46:44.691 --> 01:46:46.251
Yes, Mother Hayme!

01:46:49.811 --> 01:46:51.571
God bless you all.

01:46:55.611 --> 01:46:56.571
It's time

01:46:57.531 --> 01:46:59.891
to save our future.

01:47:09.971 --> 01:47:13.451
O, God, you come to the rescue
of those who are in trouble.

01:47:14.811 --> 01:47:18.291
You protect all that exists
just the way they are.

01:47:19.771 --> 01:47:22.411
You are the most merciful.

01:47:23.211 --> 01:47:25.931
Everything we have
is dependent on you alone.

01:47:27.251 --> 01:47:29.731
Not even a leaf falls without your wish.

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:34.931
You are all knowing and all powerful.

01:47:35.611 --> 01:47:40.011
Who could cure the sick
if you don't help them?

01:47:42.491 --> 01:47:45.651
Whose house could they take shelter in
if you don't help them?

01:47:46.411 --> 01:47:49.491
You help your followers
when they are in trouble.

01:47:51.051 --> 01:47:53.611
We beg only you.

01:47:54.331 --> 01:47:58.131
We take refuge in you
as helpless as we are and beg you.

01:47:59.171 --> 01:48:02.771
Honor thy name as the one who cures,
and cure this servant of yours

01:48:03.531 --> 01:48:07.171
who struggles to serve you.

01:48:08.211 --> 01:48:11.811
Hear our prayers for the love
of your holy prophet.

01:48:12.891 --> 01:48:15.411
Hear our prayers.

01:48:36.291 --> 01:48:37.771
Why did you want to see me?

01:48:38.491 --> 01:48:39.491
What do you want?

01:48:40.491 --> 01:48:42.091
How is the Sultan's condition?

01:48:43.211 --> 01:48:45.611
He's in agony. What do you want?

01:48:46.811 --> 01:48:48.771
If the traitor is not one of us,

01:48:49.611 --> 01:48:53.731
then it means that Vasilius
knows our Sultan is at the inn.

01:48:54.771 --> 01:48:57.011
He couldn't possibly know
that the Sultan is here.

01:48:58.211 --> 01:49:00.931
We know that there is a traitor
in the Sultan's palace.

01:49:01.811 --> 01:49:03.371
Where did that come from?

01:49:03.851 --> 01:49:05.371
The Sultan's eyes in Nicaea

01:49:06.571 --> 01:49:08.251
was coming to tell me who the traitor was.

01:49:09.691 --> 01:49:11.131
But Vasilius killed him.

01:49:13.171 --> 01:49:14.611
The Sultan knows about it.

01:49:16.451 --> 01:49:19.011
Who is that traitor, then?

01:49:20.371 --> 01:49:23.211
He got away from Nicaea
before he could find out.

01:49:25.091 --> 01:49:30.531
If the traitor told the emperor
that the Sultan was coming here,

01:49:31.491 --> 01:49:33.611
then it means that Vasilius knows as well.

01:49:40.051 --> 01:49:42.371
The Sultan only tells his closest circle

01:49:42.811 --> 01:49:46.531
where he's going
when he walks in disguise.

01:49:47.571 --> 01:49:50.931
If something were to happen to him,
it would be them who lost their heads,

01:49:51.051 --> 01:49:54.571
so it's impossible for that traitor
to find out about it.

01:49:55.451 --> 01:49:58.531
If Vasilius attacks the inn,

01:49:59.691 --> 01:50:01.371
that means we are doomed, Emir Sadettin.

01:50:03.891 --> 01:50:05.051
That's impossible.

01:50:05.131 --> 01:50:07.491
It was equally impossible
to poison our Sultan.

01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:15.851
Why didn't he tell me that
there was a traitor at the palace?

01:50:17.131 --> 01:50:18.331
Why?

01:50:23.811 --> 01:50:26.531
So, he trusts you and not me, huh?

01:50:28.531 --> 01:50:31.291
This is not the time and place
to be crying about it.

01:50:32.331 --> 01:50:34.051
Even if our Sultan is cured
from that poison,

01:50:34.611 --> 01:50:39.131
he won't make it if Vasilius attacks
this place without my men protecting it.

01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:46.211
Take the necessary precautions.
This is my last warning.

01:50:56.131 --> 01:50:57.451
Open!

01:51:23.891 --> 01:51:27.211
Victory awaits us beyond the horizon,
Nikolas.

01:51:28.331 --> 01:51:29.891
A glorious victory.

01:51:32.531 --> 01:51:34.171
And your name written all over
that victory.

01:51:34.691 --> 01:51:35.811
No.

01:51:36.291 --> 01:51:37.611
Our name.

01:51:38.931 --> 01:51:42.091
The shadow of our dominance
will stretch all the way out here.

01:51:48.491 --> 01:51:50.491
I can feel the Lord's soul with us.

01:51:52.331 --> 01:51:53.971
God bless our army.

01:52:01.331 --> 01:52:03.651
Sir, Turkmen beys are heading to the inn.

01:52:08.891 --> 01:52:10.571
It's time, Nikolas.

01:52:11.451 --> 01:52:15.331
It's time to embrace the victory
awaiting us

01:52:15.491 --> 01:52:17.651
beyond the horizon.

01:52:46.651 --> 01:52:51.811
Is this how you greet the loyal beys
of our Sultan, soldier?

01:53:01.171 --> 01:53:02.291
What's this?

01:53:07.891 --> 01:53:08.891
What do you want?

01:53:10.211 --> 01:53:15.891
Every one of the Turkmen beys
that the Sultan placed on these lands

01:53:16.611 --> 01:53:19.891
wants to see Emir Sadettin.
Let him know.

01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:28.811
On the orders of Emir Sadettin,
we can't let anybody in.

01:53:32.971 --> 01:53:35.131
Tell Emir Sadettin that

01:53:35.451 --> 01:53:38.971
Aslıhan Hatun has come
as the representative of the Cavdars.

01:53:40.171 --> 01:53:43.331
He's aware of everything,
as our Turkmen beys are.

01:53:44.011 --> 01:53:46.051
Do as we say, or else...

01:53:48.251 --> 01:53:50.851
You can only take our dead bodies
away from here.

01:54:03.531 --> 01:54:04.611
Wait here.

01:54:17.931 --> 01:54:20.611
Tighten the security
around Hanlı Bazaar.

01:54:21.171 --> 01:54:23.411
The bastard Vasilius could attack
at any moment.

01:54:23.971 --> 01:54:26.251
Your Highness,
if that's really possible,

01:54:26.371 --> 01:54:28.891
then we must get our Sultan
out of here fast.

01:54:29.131 --> 01:54:32.891
Don't you know that he's in pain?
How could we move him the way he is?

01:54:34.131 --> 01:54:35.971
What if we are attacked on the road?

01:54:37.411 --> 01:54:40.771
Do as I say. The Sultan stays here.

01:54:42.211 --> 01:54:44.371
Tighten the measures around the inn.

01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:46.771
Yes, Your Highness.

01:55:07.371 --> 01:55:08.731
Your Highness.

01:55:11.091 --> 01:55:12.331
Turkmen beys have come.

01:55:13.571 --> 01:55:16.011
Damn. That's the last thing we need now.

01:55:16.651 --> 01:55:18.011
Tell them to leave.

01:55:18.131 --> 01:55:21.091
Aslıhan Hatun and Hayme Hatun
are both among them.

01:55:21.451 --> 01:55:23.931
They said they will not leave the inn
under any circumstances

01:55:25.211 --> 01:55:27.411
I can't believe it.

01:55:28.931 --> 01:55:30.691
They say they know everything.

01:55:30.851 --> 01:55:33.011
They know that our Sultan is here.

01:55:39.371 --> 01:55:41.771
Jeez. All right, let them in.

01:55:57.571 --> 01:55:58.811
Gosh!

01:56:15.411 --> 01:56:16.731
Ertuğrul Bey!

01:56:16.971 --> 01:56:18.531
We have come with the Turkmen beys.

01:56:18.651 --> 01:56:20.491
Know that we are on your side.

01:56:22.451 --> 01:56:23.451
Mother.

01:57:00.491 --> 01:57:02.411
Whenever you are nearby,

01:57:03.611 --> 01:57:06.171
trouble befalls us.

01:57:09.211 --> 01:57:10.691
You didn't surprise me this time.

01:57:13.491 --> 01:57:17.931
We all know that Ebu Mansur is the Sultan.

01:57:19.731 --> 01:57:23.611
Just like we know that
Ertuğrul Bey is innocent.

01:57:25.011 --> 01:57:29.851
All the other beys before you have
the same opinion, Emir Sadettin.

01:57:31.731 --> 01:57:34.171
Yes, Ertuğrul Bey is innocent!

01:57:34.371 --> 01:57:38.051
Let him go right now, Your Highness.
You can right this wrong.

01:57:40.891 --> 01:57:42.051
How dare you?

01:57:45.571 --> 01:57:49.771
How dare you dictate
the Ameer of our country

01:57:50.651 --> 01:57:52.891
on what to do.

01:57:57.051 --> 01:57:58.971
Men! Guards!

01:58:03.211 --> 01:58:04.811
Throw them all out.

01:58:05.291 --> 01:58:08.091
If they resist, show no mercy.

01:58:17.891 --> 01:58:19.251
Hayme Hatun.

01:58:25.931 --> 01:58:26.891
Aslıhan!

01:58:29.331 --> 01:58:30.811
What do you think you are doing?

01:58:31.051 --> 01:58:34.091
We are well aware of
what we are doing, Emir Sadettin.

01:58:34.891 --> 01:58:36.411
The question is, are you?

01:58:38.371 --> 01:58:40.171
If need be, we won't hesitate

01:58:40.891 --> 01:58:44.371
to put you in your place.

01:58:46.051 --> 01:58:51.331
If we must die, we shall die
for the sake of Ertuğrul Bey.

01:58:51.771 --> 01:58:53.651
Let him go!

01:58:54.571 --> 01:58:56.131
Emir Sadettin!

01:59:00.211 --> 01:59:04.211
-Impossible! Sultan Alaeddin!
-God bless, our Sultan is saved.

01:59:05.011 --> 01:59:06.411
Your Highness...

01:59:18.451 --> 01:59:20.811
Thank God, you are okay.

01:59:21.091 --> 01:59:22.131
Thank God.

01:59:26.811 --> 01:59:31.331
How could you think that
Ertuğrul Bey would poison me?

01:59:33.131 --> 01:59:34.131
How dare you

01:59:35.211 --> 01:59:40.051
treat my margrave, to whom I would
entrust this land in a heartbeat,

01:59:40.891 --> 01:59:43.051
like this?

01:59:44.731 --> 01:59:46.811
Let him go right this moment.

01:59:48.531 --> 01:59:49.571
Right now!

01:59:51.411 --> 01:59:52.691
I want to see him now.

01:59:52.811 --> 01:59:53.771
Soldier.

01:59:55.691 --> 01:59:58.411
Get Ertuğrul Bey out.
Have him come here fast.

02:00:24.811 --> 02:00:25.971
Beys!

02:00:30.331 --> 02:00:31.851
Brave women of Turks!

02:00:36.811 --> 02:00:37.891
Sit.

02:00:51.851 --> 02:00:54.011
Sultan wants to see you, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:00:57.091 --> 02:00:58.771
Is he all right?

02:00:59.491 --> 02:01:02.011
Turkmen beys have arrived.
He's with them now.

02:01:03.771 --> 02:01:04.811
Thank God.

02:01:15.891 --> 02:01:19.811
Once again, I witness just how much
Ertuğrul Bey is liked and respected

02:01:20.691 --> 02:01:22.731
thanks to you all.

02:01:25.091 --> 02:01:29.331
Emir Sadettin lost his composure
and stepped out of line

02:01:29.451 --> 02:01:31.971
because of what happened to me.

02:01:33.531 --> 02:01:35.651
I know that Ertuğrul Bey is innocent.

02:01:44.211 --> 02:01:45.251
Your Highness.

02:01:45.811 --> 02:01:48.571
Come, Ertuğrul Bey. Sit.

02:02:11.051 --> 02:02:13.131
Thank god you are okay, Your Highness.

02:02:15.011 --> 02:02:16.731
If I can still breathe

02:02:17.971 --> 02:02:20.931
and sit alongside my brave beys,

02:02:21.771 --> 02:02:25.931
it's thanks to Ibn Al Arabi and you,
Ertuğrul Bey.

02:02:29.611 --> 02:02:34.611
I'd like you to forgive Emir Sadettin
for the way he treated you.

02:02:39.451 --> 02:02:41.171
Whose doing is this then, Your Highness?

02:02:42.411 --> 02:02:47.011
I don't know where I was poisoned.
It could be before I came here.

02:02:48.611 --> 02:02:52.051
We will never find out
when the poison entered

02:02:52.291 --> 02:02:54.091
our Sultan's body.

02:02:56.171 --> 02:03:00.891
However, he made it out alive
thanks to everyone's prayers

02:03:01.771 --> 02:03:04.331
and his strong body.

02:03:06.891 --> 02:03:07.851
Right.

02:03:09.171 --> 02:03:12.091
Thank god we pulled through this,
Your Highness.

02:03:13.131 --> 02:03:17.051
But I want you to know that
there is yet another threat.

02:03:18.051 --> 02:03:20.091
What are you worried about, Ertuğrul Bey?

02:03:22.451 --> 02:03:23.411
Vasilius.

02:03:26.171 --> 02:03:29.931
He definitely knows that
you are at the Hanlı Bazaar.

02:03:34.211 --> 02:03:35.811
I took the necessary measures.

02:03:39.931 --> 02:03:41.531
If there is an attack,

02:03:42.811 --> 02:03:45.531
we won't be able to protect ourselves
against it

02:03:47.411 --> 02:03:51.091
with the few guards and soldiers
we have at the inn.

02:04:01.531 --> 02:04:02.491
Your Highness.

02:04:09.251 --> 02:04:13.891
You've received some important intel
from one of our men watching Karacahisar.

02:04:16.051 --> 02:04:17.851
What did they see? Tell me.

02:04:18.531 --> 02:04:22.091
Vasilius left the fortress
with his men, Your Highness.

02:04:22.691 --> 02:04:25.411
He's garrisoned on a hill
near the Hanlı Bazaar.

02:04:28.971 --> 02:04:31.331
You were right once again, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:04:34.891 --> 02:04:37.611
We will retaliate if there is an attack.

02:04:38.531 --> 02:04:43.331
Sir, Bamsı is waiting for your orders
outside the inn with his men.

02:04:44.611 --> 02:04:45.851
Thank you, Turgut.

02:04:50.171 --> 02:04:53.331
Your Highness, allow me
to tell you one more thing.

02:04:55.451 --> 02:04:57.851
When we were fighting,

02:04:58.011 --> 02:05:01.131
Vasilius saw who Ebu Mansur
and his men were.

02:05:02.051 --> 02:05:06.811
If he sees them leaving the inn now,
he will definitely go after them.

02:05:09.251 --> 02:05:14.331
We should have your guards
protect the inn, if they may.

02:05:16.691 --> 02:05:20.571
And we should send for help
from Cavdar and Kayi tribes.

02:05:21.811 --> 02:05:24.491
You will be safe here.

02:05:27.131 --> 02:05:28.331
Me and my men

02:05:28.931 --> 02:05:32.531
will disguise in your clothes
and leave the inn.

02:05:41.411 --> 02:05:46.811
Vasilius will think you got away
and follow me instead.

02:05:51.131 --> 02:05:54.011
This will grant us with enough time

02:05:54.491 --> 02:05:58.331
for my men to come here
and ensure your safety.

02:05:59.531 --> 02:06:04.171
Once Vasilius goes after you,
you won't make it out alive, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:06:04.931 --> 02:06:08.091
I'd lay my life down for my country

02:06:08.651 --> 02:06:10.811
and for you anytime, Your Highness.

02:06:15.891 --> 02:06:18.411
I'll instruct my men around the inn

02:06:19.211 --> 02:06:21.331
to wait for me at Raven Valley.

02:06:22.011 --> 02:06:26.571
I'll lure Vasilius to Raven Valley
once I'm out of here.

02:06:27.531 --> 02:06:30.331
At last, the day has come.

02:06:31.491 --> 02:06:33.771
I'll take Vasilius down.

02:06:51.211 --> 02:06:53.251
Keep the formation!

02:06:54.531 --> 02:06:57.851
You will surround the inn
and wait for our orders.

02:06:59.331 --> 02:07:02.251
Archers will be right behind you.

02:07:11.251 --> 02:07:14.651
There is nowhere they can run.
They are fewer in numbers.

02:07:15.291 --> 02:07:20.651
But we will have a unit here
against all odds.

02:07:22.291 --> 02:07:26.131
The archers will protect us from here.

02:07:28.091 --> 02:07:31.371
We won't start before we surround the inn.

02:07:32.931 --> 02:07:36.611
We will be as silent and strong
as the wind.

02:07:37.931 --> 02:07:40.491
They might take the Sultan
and run for it with the first attack.

02:07:41.491 --> 02:07:42.851
Leave it to me.

02:07:43.411 --> 02:07:45.531
I want to catch the Sultan alive.

02:07:46.091 --> 02:07:47.411
What about Ertuğrul?

02:07:47.971 --> 02:07:49.251
Ertuğrul...

02:07:51.611 --> 02:07:55.971
I would have liked to make him watch
the torture his Sultan will go through.

02:07:56.211 --> 02:07:58.771
But I can't stand him after all.
He dies.

02:07:59.771 --> 02:08:01.491
As you wish, sir.

02:08:02.611 --> 02:08:05.251
Our men are in position.
They are waiting for your orders, sir.

02:08:07.171 --> 02:08:08.331
Good.

02:08:10.811 --> 02:08:12.211
Great.

02:08:33.691 --> 02:08:37.171
Sultan Alaeddin is nothing
like the emperor.

02:08:38.051 --> 02:08:39.451
Such a courageous man.

02:08:40.811 --> 02:08:43.571
It is unbelievable
that he came here in person.

02:08:45.371 --> 02:08:48.931
The Sultan is only a sultan
if he's one with his people, Hafsa.

02:08:50.251 --> 02:08:51.971
He is one of us.

02:08:54.171 --> 02:08:56.731
However, the dangers are imminent.

02:08:57.331 --> 02:08:59.051
We're already in danger.

02:08:59.891 --> 02:09:03.811
Everybody knows
that Ertuğrul Bey is innocent.

02:09:04.131 --> 02:09:07.851
I'm sure the Sultan will think the same
once he opens his eyes.

02:09:08.331 --> 02:09:09.771
What if he doesn't?

02:09:11.371 --> 02:09:13.051
Don't talk like that, Hafsa.

02:09:14.691 --> 02:09:17.291
He's a resilient man.
He will pull through this.

02:09:21.971 --> 02:09:23.371
If he can't make it,

02:09:24.331 --> 02:09:27.971
that's when we will all be doomed.

02:09:30.011 --> 02:09:32.811
Come to your senses, both of you.

02:09:33.411 --> 02:09:35.211
There is no use worrying.

02:09:36.371 --> 02:09:39.491
Our men have pulled through
the gravest of dangers.

02:09:40.371 --> 02:09:43.251
They will surely find a way
to pull through again.

02:09:46.291 --> 02:09:49.211
Since the day I came here, I've been
living with my heart in my boots.

02:09:50.251 --> 02:09:54.851
I understand now what it means
to be the wife of a Turk.

02:09:58.131 --> 02:10:00.491
What makes Turkish women strong and proud

02:10:00.611 --> 02:10:05.011
is pain, Hafsa. It's their loyalty
and faith in their husbands.

02:10:05.891 --> 02:10:07.691
Never lose your faith.

02:10:33.371 --> 02:10:34.331
Sir.

02:10:36.091 --> 02:10:37.691
Bamsı and his men are on the way.

02:10:37.851 --> 02:10:40.811
They will lie in wait at the Raven Valley
and set up a trap.

02:10:41.691 --> 02:10:43.131
Thank you, Turgut.

02:10:56.691 --> 02:10:57.731
We are ready, sir.

02:11:01.891 --> 02:11:05.331
May God protect you, Ertuğrul Bey.
Blessed be your war.

02:11:06.931 --> 02:11:09.291
May your swords be sharp
and your horses fast.

02:11:10.491 --> 02:11:11.931
May God help us all.

02:11:14.011 --> 02:11:14.971
Amen.

02:11:16.211 --> 02:11:17.811
Give me your blessings.

02:11:18.491 --> 02:11:20.051
God bless you, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:11:27.051 --> 02:11:28.291
Give me your blessings, too.

02:11:28.451 --> 02:11:30.731
-God bless you.
-God bless you.

02:11:36.931 --> 02:11:40.651
Your wife and your children
are waiting for you at the marquee.

02:11:41.931 --> 02:11:45.091
Go, and come back unharmed
and victorious, son.

02:11:46.051 --> 02:11:47.051
I hope I can, Mother.

02:12:06.811 --> 02:12:09.771
May God help you, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:12:11.811 --> 02:12:14.251
I'll pray for your return with victory.

02:12:14.451 --> 02:12:16.691
May God grant you with victory.

02:12:18.531 --> 02:12:19.491
Amen.

02:12:27.611 --> 02:12:28.891
Let's go!

02:12:31.651 --> 02:12:33.291
This is the last day Vasilius will see.

02:12:35.451 --> 02:12:38.811
This is the day that evil is defeated
and we bask in our peace.

02:12:41.291 --> 02:12:42.531
Off we go!

02:13:28.651 --> 02:13:35.491
<i>O God!</i>

02:13:37.571 --> 02:13:39.291
It's time, my soldiers.

02:13:40.411 --> 02:13:45.051
It's time to die for our empire
if need be.

02:13:45.411 --> 02:13:46.731
Long live Nicaea!

02:13:46.891 --> 02:13:49.691
Long live Nicaea!

02:13:49.971 --> 02:13:52.891
Long live Nicaea!

02:13:53.011 --> 02:13:56.291
Long live Nicaea!

02:13:56.411 --> 02:13:58.051
We will show no mercy.

02:13:58.251 --> 02:14:01.491
Show no mercy! And remember.

02:14:02.171 --> 02:14:06.451
Either Nicaea lives, or we die.

02:14:06.651 --> 02:14:09.291
Long live Nicaea!

02:14:09.531 --> 02:14:12.251
Long live Nicaea!

02:14:12.451 --> 02:14:15.131
Long live Nicaea!

02:14:19.051 --> 02:14:20.251
-Sir.
-What is it?

02:14:20.411 --> 02:14:23.531
Sir, the Sultan left the Hanlı Bazaar
with his guards on horseback.

02:14:23.891 --> 02:14:25.171
What? Is that true?

02:14:25.371 --> 02:14:27.891
I saw it with myself, sir.
Ertuğrul was with him.

02:14:31.971 --> 02:14:34.611
They know we are here, sir.
They plan to take the Sultan away.

02:14:35.171 --> 02:14:37.531
Or Ertuğrul is just up to his tricks.

02:14:38.731 --> 02:14:41.571
-What could it be?
-He would do anything.

02:14:42.171 --> 02:14:45.331
Considering that they finished
the meeting already and left,

02:14:45.411 --> 02:14:46.811
they must be in a hurry.

02:14:47.451 --> 02:14:49.211
They will get away if we wait any longer.

02:14:49.971 --> 02:14:51.531
What are your orders?

02:14:59.131 --> 02:15:01.891
We will leave some men here.
You will lead them.

02:15:02.091 --> 02:15:03.971
And cover us in case
something happens.

02:15:04.051 --> 02:15:05.131
I'll go after them.

02:15:05.331 --> 02:15:06.251
Yes, sir.

02:15:06.931 --> 02:15:08.651
The vanguards, come with me!

02:16:58.211 --> 02:17:00.411
-Turgut.
-Yes, sir?

02:17:01.091 --> 02:17:03.571
-Position our men.
-Yes, sir.

02:17:15.131 --> 02:17:16.651
You all know what you must do.

02:17:17.731 --> 02:17:19.571
May God bless our war!

02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:21.091
Amen.

02:17:22.891 --> 02:17:24.291
Come on, everyone!

02:18:17.731 --> 02:18:19.571
Scatter. Keep quiet.

02:18:35.291 --> 02:18:38.691
I can hear your heartbeat, Ertuğrul.

02:18:40.571 --> 02:18:42.731
It's fluttering like a bird out of fear.

02:18:45.491 --> 02:18:48.091
Tell me, where did you disappear to?

02:19:02.331 --> 02:19:03.691
This way, sir.

02:19:03.971 --> 02:19:05.931
-They took a break.
-A break?

02:19:09.011 --> 02:19:10.971
So they don't know that I'm here.

02:19:12.211 --> 02:19:14.771
I overestimated you, Ertuğrul.

02:19:16.611 --> 02:19:20.211
What a pitiful outcome for the Turks.
They'll rot away on a stream bed.

02:19:20.851 --> 02:19:22.811
-Commander.
-Yes, sir.

02:19:22.891 --> 02:19:25.251
Order our men to surround them.

02:19:25.851 --> 02:19:29.811
But make sure they keep quiet.
Understood?

02:19:30.091 --> 02:19:31.411
Yes, sir.

02:20:36.411 --> 02:20:39.491
I want the Sultan alive.
Surround them.

02:20:46.651 --> 02:20:51.531
Sir, even if he doesn't come,
Vasilius' archers could kill us all.

02:20:54.371 --> 02:20:56.611
Vasilius likes to show off, Dumrul.

02:20:57.891 --> 02:21:00.611
He won't make his move without boasting.

02:21:01.731 --> 02:21:06.051
Vasilius learned his lesson, sir.
I don't think he wants to talk to you.

02:21:07.251 --> 02:21:10.851
Maybe not with me,
but he will want to talk to you.

02:21:11.851 --> 02:21:13.211
Right, sir.

02:21:47.091 --> 02:21:48.891
Look at that, Ertuğrul!

02:22:07.131 --> 02:22:08.731
We keep encountering each other.

02:22:16.771 --> 02:22:18.211
And you keep running, Vasilius.

02:22:23.571 --> 02:22:27.571
So, you took your Sultan for a walk
on my land, huh?

02:22:31.531 --> 02:22:34.171
To think my fate would allow me
to see both of you.

02:22:46.011 --> 02:22:49.411
You can't see our Sultan,
even in your dreams.

02:23:29.651 --> 02:23:30.931
This, again?
