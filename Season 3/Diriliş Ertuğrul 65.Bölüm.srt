00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 65 will start after 12:34 min.

12:43.808 --> 12:47.528
The Venetians want 1,500 rugs from us.

12:50.367 --> 12:54.847
It's almost impossible to deliver
such an order until spring.

12:55.447 --> 13:00.807
But if the skilled ladies
of the two tribes join forces,

13:01.847 --> 13:05.087
then I say everyone will win.

13:10.767 --> 13:12.327
What are you saying, sir?

13:12.487 --> 13:16.927
As a token of our friendship,
I offer business to the Kayis.

13:27.927 --> 13:31.567
I have already said what's on my mind.

13:32.127 --> 13:36.727
The important thing now is
to find out what's on Ertuğrul Bey's mind.

13:55.727 --> 13:59.367
First of all, you honor us, Candar Bey.

14:01.927 --> 14:04.087
We believe prosperity comes from God.

14:05.527 --> 14:08.727
We can at best appreciate the middleman.

14:15.647 --> 14:20.367
Before giving a response,
I'd like to discuss it with my family.

14:21.887 --> 14:25.607
I value their opinions.

14:29.407 --> 14:31.167
You are right, Ertuğrul Bey.

14:31.807 --> 14:36.607
This partnership would affect
both the men and the women of each tribe.

14:38.087 --> 14:43.087
I don't want anything to spoil my hosting
you and your family here tonight.

14:46.647 --> 14:48.527
We'll see what the new day holds for us.

15:11.087 --> 15:15.007
{\an8}HANLI BAZAAR

15:29.527 --> 15:32.447
-Do I have your permission, Master Simon?
-Come, Petrus.

15:42.887 --> 15:45.567
-Everything is ready for the ceremony.
-I'm coming, Petrus.

15:47.127 --> 15:51.367
Candar Bey is hosting Ertuğrul
and his family tonight.

15:53.847 --> 15:55.287
Wise old man Candar.

16:00.807 --> 16:04.927
So he figured out Ural
was the one who led the raid.

16:05.767 --> 16:08.007
He's trying to end the war
before it even begins.

16:09.407 --> 16:11.247
We'll soon see what comes of it.

16:45.824 --> 16:50.464
This business has come to us
in our time of need.

16:51.104 --> 16:53.264
But there is something
I've been wondering about.

16:54.184 --> 16:57.304
Why are they offering it to us?

16:57.984 --> 16:59.904
No gazelle runs to its hunter, Mother.

17:00.824 --> 17:03.024
Candar Bey has his reasons.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.424
It's payment for our Alps' blood.

17:11.624 --> 17:16.264
Our two tribes are not at war,
why would they pay the price?

17:18.344 --> 17:20.744
Who benefits from our rugs being burned?

17:21.664 --> 17:23.064
And who makes a loss?

17:26.984 --> 17:31.584
I suspect it was Ural Bey
who burned our rugs and killed our Alps.

17:32.864 --> 17:36.304
We think Candar Bey is trying
to put out the fire set alight by his son

17:36.464 --> 17:41.104
to prevent Ertuğrul Bey
going after him, Lady Hayme.

17:43.384 --> 17:47.504
If it was indeed Ural Bey
who had our Alps murdered,

17:48.144 --> 17:49.824
then he must pay for it.

17:50.264 --> 17:53.144
And if Candar Bey knows what he has done

17:53.784 --> 17:55.424
but chooses to go this way...

17:57.224 --> 17:59.384
then we must stay sharp.

18:01.464 --> 18:05.024
Mother, everything points to Ural,

18:05.504 --> 18:07.144
but we don't have any proof.

18:07.824 --> 18:09.904
We'll stay silent until we can prove it.

18:10.704 --> 18:13.664
Keep in mind that
these lands are dangerous.

18:15.424 --> 18:20.464
Ertuğrul Bey, if you accept this offer,
let me and my mother manage it.

18:21.544 --> 18:24.144
We can't leave the management
of the rug house to Colpan and Ural.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.264
You will manage the rug house,
Sultan Halime.

18:27.984 --> 18:29.544
That will be our only condition.

18:34.824 --> 18:39.224
I will make them pay
for what they have done.

18:43.704 --> 18:47.984
I put so much effort into getting
this business from the French traders.

18:48.464 --> 18:50.424
Why, Father? Why?

18:51.584 --> 18:57.104
So, that you can just give our
earnings away to some newcomer?

18:59.384 --> 19:01.464
The tribe of Cavdar has got to this point

19:01.944 --> 19:06.424
not by increasing its enemies,
but by decreasing them.

19:08.224 --> 19:11.624
Father, you can't be sure
the Kayis are our friends or our enemies.

19:12.624 --> 19:14.304
You talk about the power of Cavdar,

19:14.824 --> 19:18.824
but all you're doing
is spoiling a bunch of peasants.

19:20.024 --> 19:23.584
Let's deal with the situation properly.
We have the power for it.

19:24.984 --> 19:29.184
I too know what we're capable of.

19:29.904 --> 19:34.744
This partnership is necessary
for the sake of both tribes.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.704
I don't want to hear any objections.

19:44.784 --> 19:45.744
Aliyar,

19:47.024 --> 19:48.824
you will manage this.

19:52.624 --> 19:53.744
As you wish, sir.

19:56.424 --> 19:58.024
Ural will help you.

20:02.024 --> 20:05.464
Sir, who will manage the rug house,
the women of the tribes?

20:07.104 --> 20:08.464
We'll talk about that tomorrow.

20:09.464 --> 20:11.904
Let's wait until they
accept our offer first.

20:12.264 --> 20:13.784
That's all I have to say.

20:34.064 --> 20:35.744
I can't understand why the old man

20:36.224 --> 20:38.904
has suddenly decided on
making this partnership, brother.

20:39.344 --> 20:43.904
The most important thing is that Father
has made a fair and just decision, right?

20:46.144 --> 20:48.104
I hope there aren't any ulterior motives.

21:24.824 --> 21:26.344
Calm down, husband.

21:29.024 --> 21:31.304
This way, everyone
will reveal their thoughts.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.744
You'll find out who is an enemy
and who is an ally.

21:35.784 --> 21:39.744
The price of that will be too high
for me, Lady Colpan.

21:40.184 --> 21:44.904
I can't stand sharing our gold
with a half-wit like Ertuğrul.

21:46.064 --> 21:47.824
But do you know what's worse?

21:48.424 --> 21:52.424
I've never seen...
my father look so afraid.

21:53.144 --> 21:54.184
What is he afraid of?

21:54.544 --> 21:57.024
Of war. Of spilling blood.

21:59.384 --> 22:02.344
He used to make the earth tremble,
but now...

22:02.704 --> 22:05.024
he's too afraid to do what must be done.

22:06.224 --> 22:08.184
How will we prevent this partnership?

22:09.264 --> 22:12.544
We won't... Simon will prevent it.

22:13.704 --> 22:16.144
Why would Simon do such a thing?

22:16.744 --> 22:17.704
Simon...

22:18.984 --> 22:21.344
always thinks of rebels like Ertuğrul...

22:22.304 --> 22:24.824
as potential threats.

22:26.424 --> 22:29.224
When he learns
Ertuğrul is involved in this...

22:30.704 --> 22:34.424
he won't give him a place to rest in
his bazaar, let alone a stand.

22:37.464 --> 22:38.744
He'll choose me!

22:46.144 --> 22:49.584
This book contains very
valuable intelligence.

22:49.664 --> 22:52.464
It was written by Mentor Petruccio
of the crusader region of Antakya.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.264
Before Mentor Petruccio died,

22:54.344 --> 22:57.384
he left us crucial information
about Ertuğrul.

22:57.784 --> 23:03.304
He is brave, courageous,
god-fearing and religious...

23:04.144 --> 23:06.784
He seems a worthy rival,

23:07.144 --> 23:09.744
as noble as a templar.

23:10.384 --> 23:11.744
But that is not enough.

23:12.904 --> 23:14.824
We will be the ones
to complete this book.

23:15.664 --> 23:17.184
There are two things we don't know.

23:17.704 --> 23:20.824
Does Ertuğrul obey Sultan Alaaddin,

23:21.344 --> 23:24.744
and if he does, is he the spy?

23:25.504 --> 23:26.864
We'll find out tomorrow.

23:29.544 --> 23:30.544
Disciple Tristan.

23:33.544 --> 23:34.504
Step forward.

23:42.184 --> 23:45.504
From now on, you are a knight.

23:46.344 --> 23:48.744
And as a knight, your first mission

23:49.024 --> 23:53.624
is to sacrifice yourself if that is
what's required to take down Ertuğrul.

23:56.064 --> 23:58.504
In the name of the Father...

23:58.784 --> 24:01.504
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

24:03.824 --> 24:05.424
I declare you a knight.

24:14.184 --> 24:17.464
I'll be loyal to you always, Master Simon.

24:18.664 --> 24:21.904
He knows you caught
and exposed the spy in the bazaar.

24:23.384 --> 24:25.864
He will certainly come after you
on the way to Lesbos.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.824
He'll try to catch you and get you to talk
in order to learn about me.

24:31.064 --> 24:32.504
I'm absolutely sure of it.

24:33.344 --> 24:37.944
By setting this trap, we'll know for sure
whether Ertuğrul is actually the spy.

24:39.664 --> 24:42.744
Knight Philip will accompany you
in your first mission.

24:45.384 --> 24:46.624
May God protect you.

24:58.984 --> 24:59.984
Let the ceremony begin.

25:34.904 --> 25:37.624
The rug house can be built here
and the rugs made by our tribe.

25:38.304 --> 25:42.744
But both sides
will want to have it in their tribe.

25:43.424 --> 25:47.064
-What's the solution, sir?
-The answer is obvious, Artuk Bey.

25:48.624 --> 25:51.664
The most appropriate
place is... the bazaar.

25:52.664 --> 25:54.144
It has a critical role to play.

25:55.584 --> 25:56.784
What are you thinking, sir?

25:57.984 --> 26:02.784
The bazaar is the cradle of filth.
We can't clean the filth without going in.

26:04.384 --> 26:06.704
We'll get to the source of the filth.

26:07.864 --> 26:10.904
That's a very wise decision, sir.
Well said.

26:11.424 --> 26:13.904
Sir? May I?

26:15.464 --> 26:16.424
Come on in, Bamsi.

26:21.544 --> 26:24.664
-I have news for you, sir.
-Take a seat, tell me.

26:30.824 --> 26:32.424
Where is the trader heading?

26:32.504 --> 26:38.224
Sir, the trader is going
to Lesbos tomorrow...

26:38.984 --> 26:40.104
in order to buy slaves.

26:40.904 --> 26:43.224
Then, let's give him a brand-new slave.

26:45.544 --> 26:47.224
They will use the trader as a bait.

26:48.064 --> 26:51.624
They want to lure
the Sultan's spy into the trap.

26:51.784 --> 26:57.024
Then we will tear that trap apart, sir,
have no fear on that score.

26:57.584 --> 27:00.464
No, Bamsi.
We're going to give them what they want.

27:02.104 --> 27:03.344
Sir?

27:04.224 --> 27:06.664
We're going to let them capture you?

27:07.064 --> 27:09.904
Not me, Bamsi. The spy who'll replace me.

27:11.864 --> 27:17.904
That will confuse John the Baptist.
He believes Ertuğrul Bey is the spy.

27:18.544 --> 27:20.584
I see, I see.

27:20.864 --> 27:25.624
You're suggesting they catch me
so that I can mess them up.

27:26.544 --> 27:27.544
Not you, Bamsi.

27:29.904 --> 27:31.104
Then who?

27:36.024 --> 27:40.024
Go to the bazaar. He will find you.

28:02.824 --> 28:06.744
This is where we meticulously
handcraft our rugs.

28:08.144 --> 28:13.064
Our girls and women are very hardworking.
Each of them is a master craftswoman.

28:20.744 --> 28:23.184
May God reward your efforts, my girl.

28:24.664 --> 28:27.104
I heard you run this place.

28:27.584 --> 28:29.304
You are clearly a woman of many skills.

28:34.464 --> 28:38.184
Aslihan used to take care of this place
until she revealed her brother's business

28:38.304 --> 28:39.704
to Ertuğrul.

28:44.464 --> 28:47.744
This is not the place, Lady Colpan.

28:50.384 --> 28:53.384
Watch your words
when you are with our guests.

28:54.424 --> 28:55.664
What's the problem, my girl?

28:56.664 --> 29:00.624
Whatever Ertuğrul has to deal with
is also our concern.

29:00.864 --> 29:04.344
Lady Aslihan told him about the deal
between Ural and the Venetians.

29:04.664 --> 29:10.664
Ertuğrul Bey made them a better
offer and sold them his rugs instead.

29:13.344 --> 29:17.184
That is the nature of trade, Lady Colpan.
Certain skills are required.

29:18.024 --> 29:20.024
My words alone are not enough.

29:20.424 --> 29:21.784
Of course, it requires some skills.

29:22.544 --> 29:26.264
But a good partner...
would ease the burden.

29:28.664 --> 29:32.504
When Ertuğrul Bey makes his decision
we'll be partners not rivals.

29:33.144 --> 29:35.304
You can tell him whatever you want then.

30:05.224 --> 30:08.344
Hold your sword tight
and don't use the strength in your arm,

30:09.664 --> 30:10.904
use the strength in your heart.

30:16.744 --> 30:19.504
<i>-Selamunaleykum, </i>Bey.
<i>-Aleykumselam,</i> Aliyar Bey.

30:23.184 --> 30:25.664
All my life, I have searched for wisdom.

30:27.144 --> 30:29.504
I hope you have found
what you were looking for, Aliyar Bey.

30:30.024 --> 30:33.224
Imam Ali says;
"There are two infinite things;

30:33.784 --> 30:36.464
one is knowledge, the other is wisdom."

30:38.784 --> 30:40.144
My search continues.

30:41.424 --> 30:45.104
In these lands...
there is nothing but blood, sir.

30:46.104 --> 30:47.064
Blood.

31:40.624 --> 31:43.384
The men of these lands must be brutal,
Ertuğrul Bey.

31:45.744 --> 31:48.984
Or else...
they're food for the worms.

31:50.184 --> 31:51.344
Got to keep yourself trained.

31:58.984 --> 32:02.144
But you should be merciful while training,
Ural Bey.

32:03.384 --> 32:05.504
There is no place for mercy
in fighting, Ertuğrul Bey,

32:06.744 --> 32:10.344
else you'll give your enemy
the chance to stab you in the back.

32:12.144 --> 32:14.344
Then try to make friends, Ural Bey.

32:15.264 --> 32:16.224
Friends...?

32:16.824 --> 32:20.184
There comes a time
when even your brother leaves you.

32:21.784 --> 32:23.984
You of all people should know that.

32:26.624 --> 32:27.584
Ertuğrul Bey.

32:33.984 --> 32:34.944
We are ready.

32:52.984 --> 32:53.984
Excuse me, Bey.

32:54.864 --> 32:56.344
I'll go check on the preparations.

32:58.544 --> 32:59.904
Very well, Aliyar Bey.

33:13.584 --> 33:16.824
I heard Lady Aslihan
got into trouble for your sake.

33:17.304 --> 33:21.464
Her father demoted her
because she told you about the Venetians.

33:24.784 --> 33:28.104
Are you sad because
Lady Aslihan got demoted

33:28.944 --> 33:31.064
or because she told me
about the Venetians?

33:32.624 --> 33:35.904
No, my husband. May she live long.

33:36.624 --> 33:38.504
Thanks to her we sold our rugs.

33:39.224 --> 33:41.064
But I wish I'd known about it.

33:42.704 --> 33:44.464
So that I could have
thanked her in person.

33:45.664 --> 33:50.424
Then have no worries. You'll have
plenty of time to talk to each other.

34:09.504 --> 34:11.024
Thanks, thanks!

34:26.784 --> 34:28.624
Come here! Come here, kid!

34:30.224 --> 34:32.264
Come here, kid! Come here!

34:32.664 --> 34:33.944
Don't run! Damn!

34:39.944 --> 34:43.544
Going after a kid for a piece of ham?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

34:44.744 --> 34:48.544
It's not about the ham, it's about
the kid thinking he can steal from me.

34:49.344 --> 34:51.864
I might believe that if I didn't know you.

34:52.104 --> 34:55.744
I told you that big belly of yours
would get you into trouble, you half-wit.

35:00.904 --> 35:02.864
Hold your horses. Don't.

35:03.544 --> 35:04.504
Come with me.

35:08.944 --> 35:11.944
My comrade.

35:12.584 --> 35:14.544
My dearest friend.

35:14.704 --> 35:18.224
What have they done to you?
You've turned into a beggar.

35:19.064 --> 35:21.664
Looks good on you.

35:21.944 --> 35:24.104
So, how is work?
Manage to earn a couple of coins?

35:24.384 --> 35:27.344
I wish. No one listens to
their consciences anymore.

35:27.984 --> 35:30.904
I'm just glad not to get beaten up.

35:31.184 --> 35:32.344
I see you are healthy.

35:33.384 --> 35:34.584
You've got bigger.

35:35.224 --> 35:38.344
Bigger? No, my friend, no.

35:38.864 --> 35:41.184
We weren't even able
to eat properly until yesterday.

35:41.264 --> 35:43.864
Ertuğrul Bey managed
to sell the rugs, thank God.

35:43.944 --> 35:46.944
I know, brother.
I know about everything.

35:47.224 --> 35:49.344
You really thought I was a beggar?

35:49.984 --> 35:51.984
I'm always in contact with Ertuğrul Bey.

35:52.424 --> 35:55.064
My brother, my comrade.

35:55.464 --> 35:57.584
Welcome back, my brother!

36:34.504 --> 36:36.744
Anytime I find myself in pain...

36:37.824 --> 36:40.064
I look out the window, too.

36:40.944 --> 36:43.384
It's like a horseman
from some far-off land...

36:44.824 --> 36:46.504
will come and take me away from here,

36:47.664 --> 36:50.904
take me away from all the pain.

36:56.144 --> 36:58.784
I've prepared some medicinal tea for you.

36:59.984 --> 37:01.144
It'll ease your pain.

37:24.184 --> 37:25.144
Thank you.

37:48.264 --> 37:50.504
They won't be able to come...
those I wait for.

37:52.904 --> 37:53.864
They all...

37:55.984 --> 37:57.624
lie deep in the ground, now.

38:03.464 --> 38:04.784
I only see my own painful end...

38:07.824 --> 38:10.184
when I look out the window.

38:15.184 --> 38:18.984
You and I look at the same place
and see the same thing.

38:22.224 --> 38:26.544
I could show you my dreams...
if you wanted to see them.

38:31.664 --> 38:33.384
I have been living
in other people's dreams.

38:33.904 --> 38:36.744
That's why I'm in this mess right now.

38:39.744 --> 38:40.864
From now on,

38:44.744 --> 38:45.944
I will see my own dreams...

38:47.504 --> 38:49.064
even if they turn into nightmares.

38:53.584 --> 38:55.864
<i>Selamunaleykum. </i>Well...

38:59.224 --> 39:00.784
May I, brother?

39:04.064 --> 39:05.344
<i>Aleykumselam</i>, Bamsi.

39:12.064 --> 39:14.144
If you are here
to talk about your tribe...

39:15.544 --> 39:17.464
you should know that
I haven't changed my mind.

39:19.944 --> 39:21.184
What happened to you, brother?

39:21.944 --> 39:23.144
Did the sword of the heathen

39:23.464 --> 39:25.824
rip through your soul
as well as your body?

39:28.584 --> 39:31.024
It wasn't the heathen's sword
that ripped through my soul...

39:34.064 --> 39:35.664
It was Ertuğrul Bey.

39:40.504 --> 39:42.344
We lost our loved ones...

39:45.144 --> 39:46.744
because of the decisions he made.

39:50.424 --> 39:52.504
I still grieve for my girl.

39:55.384 --> 39:56.384
Not only that...

39:57.384 --> 40:01.384
we left our home,
and our loved ones behind.

40:03.864 --> 40:05.264
Despite everything,

40:06.344 --> 40:09.984
we stood by his side,
even when his own brother didn't.

40:12.424 --> 40:13.544
And what did he do?

40:16.664 --> 40:19.184
He made us bait, to sell his goods.

40:21.664 --> 40:23.784
He risks our lives so he can make money,

40:25.784 --> 40:28.024
just like he risks them when we fight.

40:30.104 --> 40:35.904
Ertuğrul Bey is neither a skilled
trader nor a good warrior.

40:39.024 --> 40:39.984
Brother...

40:41.104 --> 40:43.224
Do you hear what you are saying?

40:44.024 --> 40:47.384
Brother, what have they done to you?

40:47.904 --> 40:49.504
Have they poisoned your mind?

40:50.264 --> 40:51.984
These words don't belong to you.

40:59.464 --> 41:03.384
I will burn this inn down
if you have poisoned my comrade.

41:03.624 --> 41:04.584
Enough!

41:06.704 --> 41:07.664
Enough.

41:13.464 --> 41:14.824
I'm in my right mind.

41:20.224 --> 41:21.784
More so than ever.

41:33.304 --> 41:37.344
From now on...
there is only one way for me.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.704
And it's my own way.

41:43.984 --> 41:47.384
You can have... the way of Ertuğrul Bey.

41:52.744 --> 41:53.704
We...

41:54.784 --> 41:57.944
will not deviate from his way.

41:59.944 --> 42:01.624
We made a promise.

42:02.544 --> 42:03.824
A promise.

42:05.024 --> 42:08.384
You have broken that promise, brother.

42:09.824 --> 42:11.864
You have gone against its principles.

42:13.544 --> 42:15.264
The shame of that
should be enough for you.

42:18.424 --> 42:19.544
I'll take my leave now.

42:39.104 --> 42:40.264
Bamsi Alp.

42:42.584 --> 42:43.784
Bamsi Alp, wait.

42:48.864 --> 42:49.824
I'm so sorry.

42:50.904 --> 42:52.744
But you should try to understand Turgut.

42:53.744 --> 42:55.584
Just like you, he's been through a lot.

42:58.584 --> 43:00.264
Maybe you should listen to him?

43:01.304 --> 43:04.664
Actually, actually maybe
his tongue should be torn out!

43:05.064 --> 43:07.744
Sometimes violence isn't the solution,
Bamsi Alp.

43:08.144 --> 43:12.624
Instead of cutting out his tongue, why
don't you tell him what you want to hear?

43:13.504 --> 43:15.624
I'll cut his tongue off first,

43:15.784 --> 43:19.544
then it's down to you whether you use it
to get him to talk or to cook it.

43:24.104 --> 43:27.824
We prefer to cook venison.
Would you like to have some?

43:31.304 --> 43:35.024
I've already had my fill. I have.

43:35.664 --> 43:39.464
Get out of my way if you don't
want to have some of me.

43:49.984 --> 43:50.944
Funny fellow.

43:52.744 --> 43:55.264
I see Turgut has lost his loyalty.

43:58.984 --> 44:02.184
Loyalty for a Turk
is more precious than food.

44:02.704 --> 44:06.704
An Alp who swears loyalty to no one
is like a body without a soul.

44:08.264 --> 44:10.384
But Turgut has been here before.

44:11.424 --> 44:12.944
He has lost his loyalty before.

44:13.704 --> 44:15.504
But then he went back to his tribe.

44:16.624 --> 44:18.464
We read that in the Mentor's book.

44:20.624 --> 44:22.624
Do you think Turgut is playing with us?

44:24.464 --> 44:25.424
He is a Turk.

44:27.384 --> 44:29.464
Turks don't turn their backs
on their leaders easily.

44:30.544 --> 44:32.944
You should get more intimate
in order to find out.

44:33.424 --> 44:36.744
Do whatever is necessary,
but don't fall in love.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.424
He is nothing more
than prey to me, brother.

44:44.304 --> 44:46.784
Let's hope Turgut Alp really has
turned his back on his master.

44:47.744 --> 44:51.544
Then we can draw new paths for him.

44:53.504 --> 44:54.584
And if he is lying...

44:57.064 --> 44:58.784
then we will chop his head off.

45:27.064 --> 45:30.144
We considered your offer
and have decided to accept it, Candar Bey.

45:30.984 --> 45:32.584
We hope it will be good for both tribes.

45:35.664 --> 45:37.304
But we have some conditions.

45:48.504 --> 45:51.144
I hope it'll be good for both tribes, too.

45:51.984 --> 45:53.224
What are your conditions?

45:54.744 --> 45:56.784
You should deal with
the financial side of things,

45:58.184 --> 46:00.344
as you are the more experienced trader.

46:02.264 --> 46:05.144
We suggest it would be appropriate
to conduct our business in the bazaar,

46:06.544 --> 46:11.664
because of the effort involved
in transporting the goods to the bazaar.

46:12.144 --> 46:16.344
The rugs should be designed
and sold in the bazaar.

46:16.944 --> 46:18.344
You are right, Ertuğrul Bey.

46:19.344 --> 46:21.464
There is a considerable distance
between our two tribes.

46:22.224 --> 46:25.504
It makes sense to meet
at a midway point.

46:27.504 --> 46:30.824
We also suggest that Lady Halime
takes charge of the rug house.

46:36.264 --> 46:37.664
She will lead the way for the women.

46:47.144 --> 46:48.344
Deal, Ertuğrul Bey.

46:56.504 --> 47:00.304
My daughter Aslihan
and my daughter-in-law Lady Colpan

47:00.744 --> 47:04.704
will help Lady Halime any way they can.

47:13.624 --> 47:15.984
My son Aliyar is an educated man.

47:16.744 --> 47:18.944
I trust his honesty more than anything.

47:20.184 --> 47:22.464
It'd be appropriate for him
to deal with the trade.

47:24.544 --> 47:26.984
I have no doubts about Aliyar Bey.

47:31.744 --> 47:35.464
So, all there is left to do
is to find a place in the bazaar.

47:37.384 --> 47:38.344
My son Ural...

47:40.064 --> 47:43.784
will talk to the owner Simon
and take care of it.

47:45.144 --> 47:50.064
Ural, go to the bazaar with Aliyar
first thing in the morning.

47:51.304 --> 47:55.344
Have Aliyar meet with Simon
and inform him of our decision.

47:56.304 --> 47:59.304
Tell him we'd like to have a place
where we can set up the rug house.

48:01.264 --> 48:03.704
What if Simon doesn't agree?

48:05.264 --> 48:06.944
Simon is a trader, son.

48:07.984 --> 48:09.184
All he cares about is money.

48:10.024 --> 48:14.024
Do as I say and leave the rest.

48:28.824 --> 48:30.624
-Best wishes.
-Best wishes.

48:30.864 --> 48:32.664
-Best wishes.
-Best wishes.

48:41.184 --> 48:42.864
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

48:43.984 --> 48:46.904
May God make our earnings

48:47.464 --> 48:52.224
fortunate and blessed.

48:52.584 --> 48:54.104
-Amen.
-Amen.

48:55.464 --> 48:58.704
May God help both our tribes.

48:58.904 --> 49:00.744
-Amen.
<i>-Al Fatiha.</i>

49:41.664 --> 49:44.264
Get lost, Comrade Bamsi.
You know what to do.

50:02.144 --> 50:03.624
Got any change, sir?

50:19.424 --> 50:22.584
Any change you give to the man in need...

50:23.144 --> 50:24.744
will find its way back to you.

50:25.704 --> 50:26.664
Wait for it.

50:27.944 --> 50:28.904
Beggar.

50:31.864 --> 50:34.064
Don't disturb the masters
or you'll get a beating.

50:34.424 --> 50:36.064
May God protect you, little master.

50:36.664 --> 50:38.144
Don't interfere with God's business.

50:38.544 --> 50:41.864
He wouldn't ask you who to protect.
Get lost before I beat you up.

50:55.584 --> 50:57.264
Do I have your permission, Artuk Bey?

50:58.264 --> 51:00.784
Please, Aliyar Bey.

51:01.024 --> 51:02.944
Permission is God's to give.

51:12.744 --> 51:15.784
This tongue belongs to a certain
someone who died recently.

51:19.024 --> 51:20.944
But I have some doubts about it.

51:21.744 --> 51:23.304
With your knowledge of medicine,

51:23.944 --> 51:26.304
can you find out if he was poisoned?

51:31.224 --> 51:33.504
I can try, Aliyar Bey. I can try.

51:34.424 --> 51:36.864
But who was this unfortunate person?

51:37.464 --> 51:39.024
He was a poor soul.

51:41.264 --> 51:42.784
I have things to do in the bazaar.

51:43.344 --> 51:45.304
Then I will come visit your tent.

51:46.024 --> 51:47.784
If you manage
to get this tongue to speak...

51:48.384 --> 51:51.144
you can tell me everything then.

51:51.704 --> 51:52.544
Very well.

52:08.104 --> 52:13.184
Ertuğrul Bey, may our partnership
be fruitful for both our tribes.

52:14.784 --> 52:15.744
Amen.

52:16.384 --> 52:20.024
Unity means power, Candar Bey.
Now it's time for us to work.

52:21.104 --> 52:22.824
Don't worry.

52:23.984 --> 52:29.344
Aliyar and Ural will talk
to Simon and handle everything.

52:30.624 --> 52:31.984
I have no doubts, Candar Bey.

52:33.504 --> 52:36.624
Lady Aslihan and Lady Halime
will also do their best.

52:41.904 --> 52:46.184
But... don't be angry with her,
because of the deal with the Venetians.

52:47.464 --> 52:48.984
Our earnings and paths are the same.

52:51.904 --> 52:56.144
We must be leaving.
Thank you for hosting us.

52:57.184 --> 52:58.904
Safe travels.

52:59.704 --> 53:01.104
May God protect you.

53:04.384 --> 53:07.424
We will always be glad to host you here.

53:08.384 --> 53:11.704
You have my blessings.

53:12.144 --> 53:13.104
And you have mine.

53:13.584 --> 53:15.304
We're leaving with a heavy heart.

53:15.624 --> 53:19.144
May your tribe be happy
and our friendship eternal.

53:57.704 --> 54:00.064
Ertuğrul Bey is a brave
and decent man, Father.

54:01.144 --> 54:04.104
This partnership will be good
for both tribes.

54:05.624 --> 54:09.904
As long as you contain Ural,
it will be good.

54:10.944 --> 54:12.904
Take care of him.

54:14.504 --> 54:18.544
It's time you got to work
on your part of the deal.

54:42.104 --> 54:43.224
Brother, we need to go.

54:43.904 --> 54:46.664
I'm ready, Aliyar.
It's you who's fooling around.

54:47.864 --> 54:48.824
Sir.

54:49.944 --> 54:52.904
The Alp whose leg was broken
during training is not doing well.

54:53.024 --> 54:55.184
His leg is swollen.
We don't know what to do.

54:55.544 --> 54:57.744
These Alps seem to be weak.

54:57.824 --> 55:00.184
It's just his leg, just get him fixed.

55:01.104 --> 55:01.944
Where is he, Batuhan?

55:03.664 --> 55:04.504
I'll take a look.

55:06.144 --> 55:07.104
Aliyar.

55:08.464 --> 55:11.144
We have a meeting with Simon.
Let's not be late.

55:11.984 --> 55:15.504
He is our Alp, brother.
Simon can wait.

55:17.384 --> 55:18.344
Kutluca.

55:25.384 --> 55:26.344
Batuhan.

55:34.264 --> 55:35.744
Now it's your turn, Simon.

56:33.984 --> 56:36.104
Are you trying to make
a fool of me, Batuhan?

56:36.624 --> 56:37.984
Nothing's wrong with this man!

56:38.224 --> 56:40.584
He was groaning, sir.
He thought he was going to die.

56:41.704 --> 56:42.664
Batuhan.

56:44.544 --> 56:45.784
Go get my horse.

57:18.890 --> 57:21.690
You're dead now, you brute!

57:22.570 --> 57:24.810
And you were supposed to ambush us, huh?

57:25.130 --> 57:28.330
You need eyes in the back of your head.
I could teach you a thing or two.

57:30.810 --> 57:32.370
If I'd had all my wits about me,

57:32.490 --> 57:35.490
I'd have had your head
before you even pulled your sword.

57:37.170 --> 57:40.450
Though I've got to admit, it'd be
hard to spot you, considering your height.

57:41.330 --> 57:44.610
What, are you still
thinking about those sausages?

57:45.530 --> 57:47.730
What sausages are you talking about?

57:48.450 --> 57:50.130
I'm too exhausted
to even think about food.

57:51.580 --> 57:54.380
Turgut keeps talking in his sleep.

57:55.420 --> 57:58.860
-What's wrong with him?
-I don't understand the things he says.

57:59.660 --> 58:01.820
He speaks very harshly about Ertuğrul Bey.

58:02.500 --> 58:04.820
It's as if our brave Turgut is gone,

58:05.420 --> 58:07.900
and a man filled with hate
has replaced him.

58:09.140 --> 58:10.420
Is that what you think?

58:11.020 --> 58:13.820
-How could he speak like that?
-And yet he does.

58:14.020 --> 58:16.460
While looking me right in the eye.

58:17.260 --> 58:21.940
If it was anybody else, I'd have
jabbed him in the chest with these swords.

58:22.740 --> 58:24.580
I would know, brother.

58:25.220 --> 58:27.340
There's no bringing him back.

58:28.340 --> 58:31.580
That's not possible, brother.
It's the pain in his heart speaking.

58:33.740 --> 58:36.300
How could I tell Ertuğrul Bey
what he said to me?

58:36.580 --> 58:38.060
I can't bring myself to tell him.

58:44.140 --> 58:45.540
Someone's coming.

58:47.020 --> 58:48.900
Come to me.

58:49.420 --> 58:51.420
I'll wreak my anger on you.

59:07.900 --> 59:10.420
Your cooking smells great as usual, Maria.

59:11.540 --> 59:14.260
But tasty food is not enough
to win a man's heart.

59:14.740 --> 59:16.580
You're spouting nonsense again, Amanda.

59:16.980 --> 59:21.180
I'm talking about Turgut.
I see you've become very close.

59:22.620 --> 59:26.220
-And here I was thinking--
-You have it wrong, whatever it is.

59:26.780 --> 59:28.220
Turgut is but a guest.

59:31.220 --> 59:33.500
Turgut! Why are you walking around?

59:33.660 --> 59:35.060
-I'm fine.
-Are you?

59:35.740 --> 59:36.700
I got hungry.

59:36.780 --> 59:39.500
You're covered in wounds,
and yet you say you're all right.

59:39.580 --> 59:41.860
Get back to bed.
I'll bring you some food.

59:43.300 --> 59:45.020
I'm telling you, woman, I'm fine.

59:52.100 --> 59:53.380
I'm sorry.

59:54.140 --> 59:57.220
It's all this worry gnawing away at the
back of my mind, I can't bear it.

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.100
I'll go mad if I stay in that room.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.100
It's obvious you wouldn't be happy
with the way things are.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.100
You are an Alp, after all.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.100
You two should eat together.

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:16.580
Don't even think about saying no.
You're stuck with Maria till you recover.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.140
You owe her your life.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.380
You must not let it happen, Simon.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.540
Aliyar will come asking
for a space to sell his rugs.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:51.740
My father supports Ertuğrul Bey now.

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.380
You must stop him.
Or we won't have an agreement.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.700
It was you who breached our agreement
when the Europeans came,

01:00:58.860 --> 01:00:59.900
or did you forget that?

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.820
That was different.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.180
I need my father's trust.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.220
Not the cleverness of Ertuğrul Bey.

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.140
You don't know Ertuğrul.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.140
If he were to come here,
it'd be the end of us.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.420
It's you who doesn't know Ertuğrul.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.380
Right now, you're seeing red.
Yet you dare tell me what to do...

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.780
Let's see what Ertuğrul
has to say when he comes.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:27.740
Ertuğrul wasn't kind enough to come.
But Aliyar should be here soon.

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:32.100
You must tell him that the deal
with Ertuğrul is off.

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.220
And that'll be an end to it,

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.580
Simon.

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.140
You must be Turgut Alp.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.620
-And you are?
-Aliyar, son of Candar Bey.

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:09.580
Ertuğrul Bey was our guest.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.860
He spoke very highly of you.
I thought I should come and wish you well.

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.580
He dares play the guest
instead of finding those...

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.820
who did this to me and my Alps?

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.420
We should expect nothing of him, it seems.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:39.580
I must get my strength back
and find those responsible myself.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.620
I've been meaning to talk to you,
Innkeeper Simon.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:24.060
Yes, Turgut Alp.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.540
I will remember the favor
you and your sister have done me

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.180
until the day I die.

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.700
I'll find whoever
is responsible and avenge you.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:37.100
You can be sure of it, Turgut Alp.

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:41.580
-Let me know when you find them.
-I will, Turgut Alp.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.260
I wish you a swift recovery, Turgut.

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.980
-I see you are better.
-Thanks.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.100
Turgut wanted to come here
on his own, brother.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.020
So, you really are getting better.

01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:58.740
Thanks to Maria Hatun.

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:03.500
Will you be going back soon?

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.860
I was the commander of the Alps there.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:20.500
I'm not going anywhere until I find
the ones responsible for their deaths.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.500
Excuse me.

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.220
Turgut is a dangerous man.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:43.340
He's made up his mind
that he's going to get his revenge.

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.940
I wouldn't want to be in their shoes.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.260
My brother, Aliyar.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.580
Let's take a breather here.

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.300
Attack!

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.900
You still have some time until
you're all out of breath. Speak.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.780
Who brought the knight
to the market?

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.740
Who was it?

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:07.580
Let's see who the dog of the Sultan is.

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:22.420
Damn, it isn't Ertuğrul.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:45.180
Working with such a wise man as you will
undoubtedly be lucrative for our bazaar.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:52.700
Thank you.

01:08:55.180 --> 01:09:00.020
I take it my brother has already told you
Candar and Ertuğrul Bey's demands.

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.620
I would have liked to have
been present during that conversation

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:06.260
but alas I had to see a wounded Alp.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.580
I'm sorry about your Alp, Aliyar Bey.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.220
Ural Bey passed on your request.

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:18.300
As I said, my father trusted
Aliyar with this duty.

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.180
I'm only here to introduce him to you.

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:28.260
I know you've been business partners
for a long time. You trust each other.

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:32.580
But both tribes agreed to this.

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:36.580
If we are to do this
quickly and honorably,

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.700
we'll do it our way.

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:43.740
I'm but a merchant, after all.
Profit is all I care about.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.140
On the other hand,
Ural Bey has a point.

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.980
I don't know Ertuğrul Bey well.
I'd like to hear what he has to say.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.900
I'm sure we could come
to an agreement if he joined us here.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.580
We were expecting Ertuğrul,
and instead we got some random Turk

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.380
Master Simon won't like this.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:19.660
There, look. He's coming around.

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.660
Identify yourself, Turk!

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.340
Your worst nightmare.

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.300
You? Don't make me laugh.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:45.620
It'll be the sweetest of dreams
to see your blood slowly spill.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.340
Give my regards to John the Baptist.

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:54.940
How do you know about him?

01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:00.380
Tell him that I'll turn his world
upside down soon.

01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:04.780
That bazaar will be
the grave of the lot of you.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.580
You won't be able to get away
with just hiding your faces.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.900
I know the lot of you.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:24.700
I know all about you people.
I know every breath, every step you take.

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:29.300
I’m not going to stop till I bury you
in this land that you've turned into hell.

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.460
Kill him.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:45.300
Charge!

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.340
Tristan, wait.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:44.700
They got away, Doğan Alp.

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:47.860
-Are we not following them?
-No, brother.

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:50.500
They'll tell their masters that
Ertuğrul Bey isn't the spy.

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.340
-That's what we want them to do.
-What?

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.540
Bamsi will explain.

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:59.100
Brother, he's never going to understand!

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.940
You didn't even try, Bamsi Alp!

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:11.420
My brother with
the most exceptional mustache.

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:17.580
I'm just teasing you.
Don't get worked up, now.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.620
Praise be, my brother.

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:25.580
Are you all right, brother?

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:28.700
Stop it, I'm not going to die
from a punch or two.

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:29.940
You great bear!

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:35.660
I haven't heard such
sweet words in a while, brother.

01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.220
-Say it again.
-You great bear!

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.860
What do we do now, brother?
They got away.

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:50.500
-Our mission here is done.
-You think so?

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:55.580
Of course, brother. That pig
Tristan will tell his masters everything.

01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.300
Get to work before sunset, brothers.
Ertuğrul Bey is waiting for you.

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.700
Yes, sir.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.700
-Brother.
-Yes?

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:07.900
How is my wife?

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:12.100
-You're not troubling her, are you?
-She is safe, brother.

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:15.620
Don't worry about her,
Cicek Hatun is well.

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.900
I hope you two are back together soon.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.620
I hope so too, brother.
I do hope so.

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.020
What will you do now?

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:31.380
I live in the mountains, brother.
I will lie low for a while.

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:34.900
May God help us, brother.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.820
Come here, brother.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:41.700
-Thank you, my brothers.
-Don't mention it.

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.580
Come on.

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:45.700
My dear Halime.

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.140
We haven't had the chance
to talk together in a long while.

01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.780
That's why I wanted to go
alone, without my mother.

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:02.260
Why are you looking away, Halime?

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:06.540
It feels like we've been getting in
and out of trouble constantly lately.

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:12.580
I felt a thrill at being alone with you
like this, I guess. That's why.

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:17.420
The things which separate us,
distance, life, time,

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.340
are nothing before a loving heart.

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:21.580
They only strengthen our love.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:41.420
-Ertuğrul, I must tell you something.
-Yes, Halime.

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:46.180
Our son, Gunduz...

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:50.100
Has something happened to our son?

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.620
He'll soon have a sibling, Bey.

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:02.780
I'm pregnant.
We'll have another child, if God permits.

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:20.660
Yes!

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:26.460
Yes!

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.100
Thank God, Halime.

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.540
With this news,

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.860
there's nothing in the whole world
that could trouble me now.

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:10.220
We came to trouble you, brave warrior.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.620
And what might that news be?

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:19.500
Let us rejoice, as well.

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:22.820
Halime.

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.540
Whenever you tell me that
you're pregnant,

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.740
something bad always happens.

01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.860
All our children
come with their own quirks.

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.940
This one comes with some common bandits.

01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.940
What do you want, you impertinent fools?
Who are you?

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.980
We are the soldiers
of Ertuğrul Bey of the Kayis.

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:51.260
We rule around here. Give us your gold.

01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:59.140
What are you laughing at?
Are you deaf? I said Ertuğrul Bey.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.420
Do you want to die?

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.820
Give us your gold and we'll let you live.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.140
Don't move or I'll kill you.

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:20.660
So, you are Ertuğrul Bey's soldiers?

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.380
You must know him well, then.

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.260
You heard us, he trained us personally.

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.740
Let's see how well I trained you.

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:18.260
Look at me, scum!

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:23.260
I'm not going to dirty my hand with
your blood on this most perfect of days.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:28.900
But if you rob anyone else in my name

01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:32.460
and I get to hear about it,
I'll hunt you down.

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.300
And if I hunt you,
I'll not rest until I have your head.

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:38.900
Got it?

01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:58.900
And so our reputation grows.

01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:03.660
Our sons will bring us even greater honor.

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:05.220
I hope so.

01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:12.420
Don't let anyone know about it just yet.

01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:16.380
When the right time comes,
we'll give them the news together.

01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.460
As you see fit.

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.380
Come on, let's go.

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.020
God!

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:42.620
Let my people grow and prosper!

01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:15.460
{\an8}KAYI CAMP

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:25.100
-Hello.
-Welcome, Ishak. Come in.

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:26.780
I brought the partridges.

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.420
What are they for, Artuk Bey?

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:44.620
They will tell us if there was
any poison in the deceased's blood.

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:50.020
In the name of God...

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:59.180
Who does that tongue belong to?
Do you have any idea, sir?

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:08.260
-Ertuğrul Bey will know.
-And you?

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.380
No, I don't know. But...

01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:17.060
according to Ertuğrul Bey,
Aliyar Bey doesn't believe that

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:21.220
Toktamış Bey would have attempted
to kill Candar Bey and his family

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:23.220
if he were in his right mind.

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:25.460
Right, sir.

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.220
Nevertheless,

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:30.140
I wonder what our holy book

01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:34.380
has to say about cutting
a dead man's tongue.

01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.940
In such conflicting cases,

01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:43.420
Maturidi of Samarkand says

01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:49.180
"We must follow the minds enlightened
with the light of Islam,

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:53.380
so that we will not stray

01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:58.420
from the path of Islam and rationality,
and lose our way in the dark."

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:00.380
Well said, sir.

01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:18.540
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:23.140
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you, Dundar.

01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:27.780
I'd like to return this seat, this tent,
and the honor of our settlement to you,

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:29.620
as per your orders.

01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:33.420
-Do you agree to it, beys?
-Yes, sir.

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:41.220
Thank you, Dundar.

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:53.220
How is the waterway coming along?
I saw the works on my way back.

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.620
Dündar Bey has given us orders
as to how to continue.

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:59.620
We'll take advantage of the hill and
its slope and fill this place with water.

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.020
How much time do you need?

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:02.380
It'll be done in three days.

01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:05.420
The women of our settlement
won't have to walk so far for water.

01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:09.780
What about the sheep pen? Winter's here.

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:11.420
We'll get it done soon.

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.220
We'll have it ready before winter
lays waste to our animals.

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:18.940
We're doing it without cutting down
any young trees, as per your orders.

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:20.420
If God permits.

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:24.540
Beys, you may leave.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:39.660
-Did something happen in my absence?
-It's all under control, brother.

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.780
But I couldn't refuse Foreman Haçaturyan.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.780
I sent him to look for the gold mine
with Samsa and Kaya Alp.

01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:49.460
He'd have died of grief otherwise.

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:52.620
Well done.

01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:56.660
-I hope he finds what he's looking for.
-With God's permission.

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:02.700
We're not going to get lost
while looking for this gold, are we?

01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:05.060
Trust me, Samsa Alp.

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:08.580
I know this place
like the back of my hand.

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:11.060
I can smell the gold.

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:13.060
It's close.

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:18.300
I didn't know it had a smell.

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.060
If you know how,

01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:24.260
not only can you smell and hear it,

01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:29.140
you can also see its bright light.

01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:31.540
Kaya, he's right.

01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:36.140
I can smell partridge
when one is in range of my bow.

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.980
Now we're speaking the same language.

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.660
You've tried so hard,
I hope you do find it.

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:43.900
Foreman Haçaturyan, the gold hunter.

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.540
I have to, my son.

01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:57.500
I owe Ertuğrul Bey my life. Not just that,
I own him a debt of honor too.

01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:01.900
I could never repay that,
even if I do find gold.

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:05.300
But at least I'll be of use to people.

01:31:06.660 --> 01:31:11.300
Gold! Gold!

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:15.900
Thank God! I knew it was here!

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:18.700
Gold!

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:22.460
Gold!

01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:25.740
-Yes!
-Yes!

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.780
Thank God, I knew it was here.

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:30.820
Gold!

01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:40.420
God bless you!

01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:42.900
Ertuğrul Bey will be very happy.

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:46.980
-What're we waiting for, then? Let's go.
-Let's go!

01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:10.300
-Bey, Aliyar Bey is here.
-Show him in, Abdurrahman.

01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:27.940
Welcome to my settlement, Aliyar Bey.

01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.220
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:31.300
Come, sit.

01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.940
I talked to Innkeeper Simon.

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:40.700
Did he accept the offer?

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:44.700
He said he would discuss it
if you joined us there tomorrow.

01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:48.700
What do you think, Aliyar Bey?

01:32:50.300 --> 01:32:52.100
It is a good idea
to have a discussion first.

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.380
Simon is a merchant, after all.

01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:56.860
He wants to make sure
his business is in safe hands.

01:32:57.340 --> 01:32:59.460
What about Ural Bey?
What does he say?

01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:03.900
It's obvious, after all, that he only
accepted because Candar Bey forced him to.

01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:07.300
My brother Ural won't make
any more mistakes, sir.

01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:09.660
I'll be overseeing the matter.

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:13.620
With my sister, Aslihan. Rest assured.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:17.060
All right, Aliyar Bey.

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.140
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:30.420
-Greetings.
-Come, sit, Artuk Bey.

01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:39.180
-Welcome, Aliyar Bey.
-Thank you, Artuk Bey.

01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:43.260
Were you able to find out
what I asked of you?

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:45.180
Yes, Aliyar Bey, indeed we did.

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.180
Ishak, bring it here.

01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:50.340
Here, sir.

01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:53.020
I believe Ertuğrul Bey
is familiar with this matter.

01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:56.820
Yes, I am. Artuk Bey told me everything.

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:01.700
Such a pity. Whose tongue is it?

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:05.420
It relates to a dispute I stumbled upon
on my way back from Konya.

01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:09.020
They asked for my help

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:12.380
but I studied astronomy,
mathematics and Islamic law.

01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:13.980
What help could I be?

01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:18.620
But I believe we can settle it
with Artuk Bey's knowledge of such things.

01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.100
So, what did you learn?

01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:39.340
I fed one of the partridges
the chemical I found in the tongue.

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.100
What happened to the other bird?

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:46.980
The chemical made the partridge
go berserk. It killed the other bird.

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.380
I've never witnessed such a thing.

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:52.980
Partridges are such peaceful beasts.

01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:57.860
It turned into a wounded lion
in the blink of an eye.

01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:02.820
After killing the other partridge,
it died, fluttering.

01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:11.580
The chemical made it ecstatic,
then drove it insane.

01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:18.820
Whatever it is, this poison hurts both
the host and the people around him,

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:20.620
Aliyar Bey.

01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:25.980
Here, sir.

01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:31.460
If you could bury the tongue
with the dead--

01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:32.900
Don't worry, Ishak.

01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:36.140
I'll do what's right.

01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:37.660
I understand, sir.

01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:40.740
Excuse me, sir.

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:46.620
As I said,
I'll be at the inn tomorrow morning.

01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:57.140
-Excuse me, sir.
-Thank you, Ishak.

01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:08.100
What do you think, sir?

01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:11.540
Clearly someone poisoned Toktamış Bey.

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.500
Could it have been Ural Bey?

01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:18.140
Once again, we see that

01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:22.380
there are but two people we can trust.

01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:25.100
Aliyar Bey and Aslıhan Hatun.

01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:27.500
What about Candar Bey?

01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:32.740
Candar Bey will do anything
for the good of his tribe.

01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:36.180
Including going against the law
and all reason.

01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:41.100
That's why we'll never reach
an understanding with Candar Bey.

01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:42.980
I see, sir.

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:54.913
How does this end, Mother?

01:36:56.073 --> 01:36:58.553
We haven't been this fortunate
for a long while.

01:36:59.673 --> 01:37:01.633
This means we can finally breathe easy.

01:37:05.473 --> 01:37:06.553
Though...

01:37:12.033 --> 01:37:12.993
There is...

01:37:13.993 --> 01:37:16.913
an inexpressible anxiety
within you, isn't there?

01:37:18.753 --> 01:37:19.753
Indeed, Mother.

01:37:22.753 --> 01:37:26.153
Ertuğrul Bey doesn't trust Ural Bey
or Candar Bey.

01:37:27.353 --> 01:37:29.793
He chooses his words so carefully,
you've seen that.

01:37:32.113 --> 01:37:35.353
Well, what about Aliyar?

01:37:36.153 --> 01:37:37.673
-Aslihan?
-Mother.

01:37:38.593 --> 01:37:41.753
Aren't they the children
of the same father?

01:37:44.153 --> 01:37:46.593
What if a situation escalates

01:37:47.033 --> 01:37:50.033
and gets out of control in the future?
What would we do then?

01:37:51.073 --> 01:37:55.993
Would Aliyar and Aslihan walk over
their father and brother to save us?

01:37:59.793 --> 01:38:01.513
And that woman, Aslihan...

01:38:05.153 --> 01:38:06.113
What about her?

01:38:08.033 --> 01:38:12.153
Why did she ignore the interests
of her own people

01:38:12.233 --> 01:38:14.233
and tell Ertuğrul Bey
about the French traders?

01:38:15.473 --> 01:38:19.193
When it came to light, she continued
to go against her own father over it.

01:38:21.153 --> 01:38:23.913
There's also that woman called Çolpan.

01:38:25.873 --> 01:38:27.713
She's got cruel eyes.

01:38:30.033 --> 01:38:34.433
But don't forget that they're
going to help you in the rug house.

01:38:35.673 --> 01:38:39.713
Whatever you want
they'll do what's necessary.

01:38:41.873 --> 01:38:43.873
We're only after our daily bread.

01:38:44.913 --> 01:38:49.193
We'll go to the bazaar every day
and weave rugs.

01:38:50.553 --> 01:38:55.673
What comes after that is up to God
and Ertuğrul Bey.

01:40:09.553 --> 01:40:11.633
As we rode our horses to the West...

01:40:13.033 --> 01:40:15.273
I saw how much the world order
has changed.

01:40:15.753 --> 01:40:18.753
The only thing that rules the East
and the West is gold, Turgut.

01:40:19.993 --> 01:40:21.793
They buried our God inside of us.

01:40:23.193 --> 01:40:24.793
And they covered it with gold.

01:40:26.633 --> 01:40:30.433
The Crusades of the Christian world
only cared about gold.

01:40:31.353 --> 01:40:33.473
If you can keep up, you'll survive.

01:40:35.313 --> 01:40:36.473
Those who can't...

01:40:38.073 --> 01:40:39.033
will die.

01:40:42.273 --> 01:40:43.913
Like a salamander in the desert.

01:40:45.593 --> 01:40:47.113
No one will remember them.

01:40:49.713 --> 01:40:52.353
The door always opens
to those who are willing to see it.

01:40:54.153 --> 01:40:56.513
If only the man would keep his eyes open.

01:41:08.913 --> 01:41:10.113
Here you are.

01:41:12.393 --> 01:41:14.513
We were talking about
how gold rules the world

01:41:14.673 --> 01:41:17.753
and provides new
opportunities to people, brother.

01:41:19.313 --> 01:41:22.113
And to a warrior
as great and as brave as you.

01:41:23.313 --> 01:41:27.193
The whole world comes to hear of
the accomplishments of brave warriors

01:41:27.353 --> 01:41:28.393
such as yourself.

01:41:29.073 --> 01:41:31.593
Everyone knows what you
and Ertuğrul Bey did

01:41:31.673 --> 01:41:33.433
to that Mongolian fool.

01:41:34.433 --> 01:41:35.673
What was his name?

01:41:36.713 --> 01:41:37.673
Noyan.

01:41:40.473 --> 01:41:42.633
If you knew how many lives we lost

01:41:43.793 --> 01:41:47.913
because of the mistakes Ertuğrul Bey made
before we got rid of that Noyan scumbag,

01:41:49.433 --> 01:41:50.433
you wouldn't say that.

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:57.393
Ertuğrul Bey's lack of foresight doesn't
overshadow your bravery, Turgut Alp.

01:41:59.953 --> 01:42:02.313
The marks the Templars left on your body

01:42:04.033 --> 01:42:06.873
are testament to the fierceness with which
you fought against those degenerates.

01:42:09.633 --> 01:42:11.033
How do you know about that?

01:42:13.153 --> 01:42:16.193
I know a great deal about the crimes
the Templars committed against our people

01:42:16.273 --> 01:42:20.433
under the command of the degenerate Pope.
And how they tortured them.

01:42:23.033 --> 01:42:25.273
The Templars murdered our family.

01:42:27.353 --> 01:42:29.153
Only Maria and I survived.

01:42:31.833 --> 01:42:35.833
They slaughtered our family
because we didn't share their beliefs.

01:42:36.753 --> 01:42:40.713
The belief we have in Jesus
wasn't enough to save our family.

01:42:44.753 --> 01:42:45.833
My condolences.

01:42:52.273 --> 01:42:54.473
Master Simon, you've got a visitor.

01:42:56.313 --> 01:42:57.273
If you'll excuse me.

01:43:26.913 --> 01:43:28.113
What happened?

01:43:31.353 --> 01:43:34.713
The Sultan's spy got away, Master Simon.

01:43:36.633 --> 01:43:39.033
How did you let Ertuğrul run away?

01:43:39.513 --> 01:43:41.433
Ertuğrul is not the Sultan's spy.

01:43:42.873 --> 01:43:46.273
-What did you say?
-I had him. I talked to him.

01:43:47.913 --> 01:43:48.913
It wasn't Ertuğrul.

01:43:49.713 --> 01:43:52.313
Then his men came and killed ours.

01:43:56.513 --> 01:43:58.953
If it wasn't for Tristan, I'd be dead now.

01:44:03.713 --> 01:44:05.033
So you saw his face.

01:44:05.953 --> 01:44:08.593
Tell me. Who is he?

01:44:13.393 --> 01:44:14.953
We didn't find out who they were.

01:44:16.433 --> 01:44:18.753
But he knows who you are,
Master Simon.

01:44:19.433 --> 01:44:20.393
What did you say?

01:44:29.473 --> 01:44:31.193
He asked me about John the Baptist.

01:44:32.673 --> 01:44:34.793
He said he was going
to knock his place down.

01:44:36.913 --> 01:44:39.833
If Ertuğrul is not the Sultan's spy

01:44:40.193 --> 01:44:44.713
we still have to get our revenge for
Master Petruccio and Knight Titus.

01:44:54.513 --> 01:44:56.673
Ertuğrul must die tomorrow, Master Simon.

01:44:58.033 --> 01:45:00.473
Ertuğrul is coming to see me tomorrow.

01:45:00.753 --> 01:45:03.673
I'll do what's necessary.
Take every measure.

01:45:04.113 --> 01:45:07.513
Take every measure necessary
inside and outside the inn.

01:45:08.233 --> 01:45:10.273
No one acts without my order.

01:45:10.433 --> 01:45:12.673
Why don't we finish the business
right away?

01:45:17.073 --> 01:45:20.513
Because I'm not sure the man we found
was actually the Sultan's spy.

01:45:34.233 --> 01:45:35.313
After that

01:45:35.513 --> 01:45:39.633
we let the slave trader and the guy
who looks like a fighting cock run away.

01:45:42.553 --> 01:45:45.433
-Where is Doğan?
-He carried out his mission.

01:45:45.713 --> 01:45:48.073
Now he's back in hiding
and awaiting your next order.

01:45:49.793 --> 01:45:52.553
They surely can't still believe
you're the Sultan's spy.

01:45:52.713 --> 01:45:57.513
They must have been so surprised when
they saw it was Doğan and not you.

01:45:58.433 --> 01:45:59.993
We can't be so sure, Dündar.

01:46:00.113 --> 01:46:03.793
We have to take care of John the Baptist
right away.

01:46:04.473 --> 01:46:06.993
Even though he hides among
the Orthodox Greeks,

01:46:07.153 --> 01:46:09.753
he's obviously one of the Templars.

01:46:10.073 --> 01:46:11.793
A wolf in a sheep's clothing.

01:46:11.953 --> 01:46:15.993
They want to kill you.
That's why they've called you in.

01:46:17.913 --> 01:46:20.433
-We're still going to go, Dündar.
-What if it's a trap?

01:46:21.073 --> 01:46:24.273
They're going to try to kill you.
It's too dangerous.

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:30.113
I'll let him live
until I learn everything about him.

01:46:31.193 --> 01:46:35.473
If he wants to kill me,
I won't hesitate to kill him first.

01:46:38.913 --> 01:46:40.393
We'll go to that inn tomorrow.

01:46:42.473 --> 01:46:45.353
We'll see who lives and who dies.

01:46:58.273 --> 01:47:01.073
Sir, Master Hacaturyan
wants to see you.

01:47:02.073 --> 01:47:03.193
Show him in, Abdurrahman.

01:47:11.073 --> 01:47:12.313
Come in, Master Hacaturyan.

01:47:17.233 --> 01:47:20.513
I have... great news for you.

01:47:21.713 --> 01:47:22.673
Tell me.

01:47:23.353 --> 01:47:24.553
With the help of God...

01:47:25.873 --> 01:47:27.913
I think we found the seam of gold.

01:47:40.073 --> 01:47:43.633
I don't know how much is there.
But we should certainly mine it.

01:47:45.353 --> 01:47:46.313
Good.

01:47:48.273 --> 01:47:50.513
Don't let anyone know about this,
Master Hacaturyan.

01:47:51.593 --> 01:47:53.153
Don't breathe a word about it.

01:47:54.753 --> 01:47:57.673
Return with the men
who first accompanied you there.

01:47:58.073 --> 01:47:59.433
Your wish is my command.

01:48:11.953 --> 01:48:13.313
Whatever happens...

01:48:14.193 --> 01:48:17.713
take care of this matter
with Simon tomorrow.

01:48:22.113 --> 01:48:24.833
-Ural.
-Here, Father.

01:48:26.113 --> 01:48:27.113
Don't you dare...

01:48:27.993 --> 01:48:31.953
cause any problems
or ignore what your brother Aliyar says.

01:48:33.913 --> 01:48:36.753
I'll support whatever is good
for our people, Father.

01:48:38.073 --> 01:48:40.433
I see that what is good...

01:48:41.313 --> 01:48:43.913
is that which passes
between your holy lips.

01:48:50.273 --> 01:48:54.993
Çolpan, don't ignore Halime Hatun.

01:48:56.513 --> 01:48:57.873
Do not worry, Bey.

01:49:02.233 --> 01:49:03.233
If you'll excuse me.

01:49:11.233 --> 01:49:12.793
Do you have something to say, daughter?

01:49:13.633 --> 01:49:18.033
I've been hearing a lot
about Halime Hatun's mastery in weaving.

01:49:19.633 --> 01:49:22.233
She learned a lot
when she traveled through

01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:24.145
many countries with her princely father.

01:49:24.593 --> 01:49:27.433
This way we'll learn more from

01:49:28.193 --> 01:49:29.873
what she knows and has experienced.

01:49:30.633 --> 01:49:31.593
Well done, daughter.

01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:38.713
If we look at things with our minds
and not with our pride, we will succeed.

01:49:41.633 --> 01:49:44.793
Aliyar, do you have anything to say?

01:49:45.233 --> 01:49:47.193
Your decision has proved
to be a wise one, Father.

01:49:48.353 --> 01:49:52.073
Our women would not have been able
to finish those rugs in such a short time.

01:49:53.553 --> 01:49:54.713
With regard to Simon...

01:49:56.113 --> 01:49:59.553
We'll get to work with Ertuğrul Bey
and get it done, Father.

01:50:02.433 --> 01:50:03.393
Good luck.

01:50:12.593 --> 01:50:17.753
The arrow has already left the bow.
And it landed in your heart.

01:50:18.313 --> 01:50:22.153
How many times will my father trap me?
How many more betrayals, Çolpan Hatun?

01:50:22.513 --> 01:50:23.633
I can't count anymore.

01:50:23.753 --> 01:50:28.193
You've put Ertuğrul in his place.

01:50:28.833 --> 01:50:32.273
You prevented the Kayis challenging us
by burning their rugs.

01:50:32.953 --> 01:50:36.033
In the new world's order,
you've done what's necessary.

01:50:37.513 --> 01:50:40.393
Your father is incapable of understanding
the importance of what you've done.

01:50:44.753 --> 01:50:46.033
Because he is afraid,

01:50:47.393 --> 01:50:52.393
he has let Ertuğrul, his wife,
and his know-all mother become a nuisance.

01:50:53.793 --> 01:50:55.793
He offered them this job
on a silver platter,

01:50:56.713 --> 01:50:58.713
knowing it would cost us thousands.

01:50:59.033 --> 01:51:02.513
But rest assured,
I'm going to take care of this business.

01:51:04.233 --> 01:51:09.833
My father, Aliyar and Aslihan
will get what they deserve.

01:51:10.633 --> 01:51:11.593
And then?

01:51:12.953 --> 01:51:14.793
Let's say you sort this problem.

01:51:16.513 --> 01:51:17.553
What happens next?

01:51:19.513 --> 01:51:21.993
Who knows how many more traps

01:51:22.073 --> 01:51:24.833
and betrayals you'll suffer
at their hands?

01:51:25.233 --> 01:51:27.913
Your father obviously favors
your siblings over you.

01:51:28.993 --> 01:51:30.553
You come after them.

01:51:31.273 --> 01:51:33.753
They get the praise
while you get to run errands.

01:51:35.033 --> 01:51:39.313
I told you, they'll get what they deserve.
Don't worry about that.

01:51:40.273 --> 01:51:42.913
I never worry when I'm with you.

01:51:43.913 --> 01:51:49.473
But as long as Aliyar and Aslihan live,
we can never be too sure.

01:51:51.313 --> 01:51:54.033
The path of our people
is a long and holy one, Hatun.

01:51:54.793 --> 01:51:57.153
We are noble and strong.

01:51:58.833 --> 01:52:00.553
Under the command of the weak,

01:52:01.713 --> 01:52:03.313
under the sword of heathens,

01:52:03.873 --> 01:52:06.833
we'd melt away
like a snowflake in the sun.

01:52:08.473 --> 01:52:12.473
But your man Ural
will never let that happen.

01:52:12.753 --> 01:52:13.713
How?

01:52:16.313 --> 01:52:17.273
I know a way

01:52:17.953 --> 01:52:19.873
of making it impossible

01:52:20.473 --> 01:52:22.953
for either of my siblings to remain here.

01:52:24.193 --> 01:52:25.673
My father will be alone.

01:52:25.873 --> 01:52:27.113
How do we do that?

01:52:27.913 --> 01:52:31.113
Through the one they rely on, Ertuğrul.

01:52:35.073 --> 01:52:38.593
When I make my move tomorrow

01:52:39.273 --> 01:52:40.633
he'll be left humiliated.

01:52:42.473 --> 01:52:46.353
And Simon will crush him like an insect.

01:52:53.433 --> 01:52:54.993
You smell so nice.

01:52:56.033 --> 01:52:57.753
Just for you.

01:53:14.113 --> 01:53:17.233
-Welcome.
-Thank you, Halime Sultan.

01:53:44.433 --> 01:53:46.273
Are you still nervous, Halime Sultan?

01:53:48.073 --> 01:53:51.793
Ural Bey will do whatever he can
to prevent this from going ahead.

01:53:54.673 --> 01:53:55.753
Simon is a merchant.

01:53:57.073 --> 01:53:59.353
In the end, all he cares about
is the gold he'll get,

01:53:59.953 --> 01:54:01.513
not Ural Bey's tears.

01:54:02.513 --> 01:54:03.513
You're right.

01:54:05.553 --> 01:54:08.393
-What about Aslihan?
-What about her?

01:54:11.993 --> 01:54:15.713
I can't decide if she's really naive
or really clever.

01:54:25.193 --> 01:54:26.473
What does that mean, Halime?

01:54:28.673 --> 01:54:32.313
Aslihan Hatun was the one who told you
about the French getting the rugs.

01:54:33.193 --> 01:54:34.873
Why did she do that?

01:54:37.793 --> 01:54:38.873
What are you thinking?

01:54:43.473 --> 01:54:47.593
I don't know, Bey. But it seems like...

01:54:51.153 --> 01:54:54.953
She has as much respect for you
as she has for Aliyar Bey.

01:54:55.873 --> 01:54:56.833
I can see that.

01:54:58.993 --> 01:55:02.873
On one side is Çolpan and Ural,
on the other Aliyar and Aslihan.

01:55:09.473 --> 01:55:11.033
I think...

01:55:12.193 --> 01:55:14.673
we have come between
Candar Bey's children.

01:55:15.233 --> 01:55:16.833
Our work will not be easy.

01:55:22.153 --> 01:55:26.473
As long as you're taking care of things
everything will be fine, Halime Sultan.

01:55:27.953 --> 01:55:30.713
That's why I wanted you
and my mother in charge.

01:55:31.593 --> 01:55:33.553
I know things wouldn't have
worked out otherwise.

01:55:35.233 --> 01:55:38.393
Besides, thanks to you, the Cavdar tribe
will learn how to weave rugs properly.

01:55:41.953 --> 01:55:43.673
Let's try to come
to an agreement with Simon.

01:56:00.513 --> 01:56:03.313
What was the disagreement between
my brother and Toktamis Bey, Aslihan?

01:56:09.033 --> 01:56:09.993
Tell me.

01:56:11.153 --> 01:56:12.873
Did it have something
to do with Simon's bazaar?

01:56:13.073 --> 01:56:15.513
Yes, that despicable bazaar

01:56:16.473 --> 01:56:18.913
ensured the hostility
between them only grew.

01:56:20.193 --> 01:56:22.873
What happened? Tell me, sister.

01:56:24.793 --> 01:56:28.113
Toktamis Bey found out Ural
was making an unfair profit.

01:56:31.033 --> 01:56:33.513
On one hand there's Ural,
on the other, Çolpan.

01:56:34.313 --> 01:56:36.553
How will we get through this?

01:56:38.633 --> 01:56:42.713
You take care of Çolpan,
and I'll take care of our brother.

01:56:45.193 --> 01:56:48.913
If you ever hear something's wrong
you must tell me right away, Aslihan.

01:56:51.633 --> 01:56:52.593
Don't worry, brother.

01:57:15.753 --> 01:57:17.753
My, my.

01:57:20.473 --> 01:57:21.433
Good night.

01:57:32.513 --> 01:57:34.513
I've come to give you some advice.

01:57:37.153 --> 01:57:41.833
Don't dare follow Ertuğrul
and bring trouble to us.

01:57:42.833 --> 01:57:47.513
The fact we can sell our products
and our animals at the bazaar,

01:57:48.033 --> 01:57:49.393
we owe to Simon.

01:57:49.993 --> 01:57:54.673
If not for this we'd be destitute,
just like Ertuğrul's people.

01:57:56.153 --> 01:57:57.953
Ertuğrul is here today, gone tomorrow.

01:57:59.113 --> 01:58:02.353
But Simon? He'll always
be in charge of the bazaar.

01:58:02.993 --> 01:58:03.953
Brother...

01:58:13.633 --> 01:58:18.313
Is it true you teamed up with Simon
to steal our people's money?

01:58:20.913 --> 01:58:21.873
Did...

01:58:23.353 --> 01:58:24.753
Aslihan tell you that?

01:58:25.833 --> 01:58:29.393
Tomorrow, two groups come together
to do serious business, brother.

01:58:30.513 --> 01:58:32.193
We all need this.

01:58:33.153 --> 01:58:34.113
Don't you dare...

01:58:35.713 --> 01:58:38.513
try pulling any tricks on us...

01:58:40.713 --> 01:58:41.673
brother.

01:59:22.113 --> 01:59:26.873
<i>While the wrongdoers run wild beside me,</i>
<i>I have to wait politically.</i>

01:59:28.033 --> 01:59:30.833
<i>It's tough. I feel humiliated.</i>

01:59:31.713 --> 01:59:34.953
<i>The skill is not to pull out your weapon</i>
<i>until you can look the enemy</i>

01:59:35.273 --> 01:59:38.073
<i>in the eye at the right time.</i>

01:59:38.553 --> 01:59:42.233
<i>There is a right time</i>
<i>for an enemy to be defeated.</i>

01:59:42.753 --> 01:59:46.433
<i>The enemy is what makes you brave</i>
<i>and like a lion.</i>

01:59:47.393 --> 01:59:50.913
<i>When can I unsheathe my sword</i>
<i>and make life unbearable for my enemy?</i>

01:59:51.513 --> 01:59:53.673
<i>There are many varieties of cruelty, son.</i>

01:59:54.433 --> 01:59:56.673
<i>The sheath stops</i>
<i>the cruelty of the sword,</i>

01:59:57.273 --> 02:00:01.913
<i>traps will end tricks' cruelty</i>
<i>and money will end money's cruelty.</i>

02:00:02.993 --> 02:00:04.273
<i>A Bey's skill lies in</i>

02:00:04.433 --> 02:00:08.833
<i>knowing if the devil is coming</i>
<i>from the right side or the left side.</i>

02:00:10.193 --> 02:00:12.073
<i>Being a Bey is a grueling burden.</i>

02:00:13.353 --> 02:00:17.513
<i>Yusuf was left in the well</i>
<i>and Ibrahim was thrown into the fire.</i>

02:00:18.073 --> 02:00:20.353
<i>Why do you think they</i>
<i>were exposed to such suffering?</i>

02:00:21.593 --> 02:00:23.753
<i>If the well didn't exist,</i>
<i>Yusuf wouldn't exist.</i>

02:00:24.073 --> 02:00:27.233
<i>And if suffering didn't exist,</i>
<i>humans wouldn't be humans.</i>

02:00:28.593 --> 02:00:31.553
<i>Mankind's trials are various.</i>

02:00:33.353 --> 02:00:35.233
<i>Some will come out of the well like Yusuf,</i>

02:00:35.673 --> 02:00:38.473
<i>some will become the devil</i>
<i>and get kicked out of heaven.</i>

02:00:40.033 --> 02:00:42.233
<i>A trial is tough, son, it's tough.</i>

02:00:42.833 --> 02:00:47.593
<i>As the Bey, you have to face the cheats</i>
<i>and appreciate justice.</i>

02:00:48.073 --> 02:00:51.393
<i>You have to fall into traps,</i>
<i>so you can learn how to get out of them.</i>

02:00:51.873 --> 02:00:57.513
<i>You have to experience disloyalty</i>
<i>and betrayal to see loyalty and sincerity.</i>

02:00:58.713 --> 02:01:01.313
<i>And then you'll climb out of the well</i>
<i>you fell into</i>

02:01:01.713 --> 02:01:04.433
<i>and become the Sultan of your land.</i>

02:01:05.033 --> 02:01:07.553
<i>May God help you.</i>

02:01:08.153 --> 02:01:11.353
<i>May God give strength to your muscles,</i>
<i>the courage to your heart</i>

02:01:11.873 --> 02:01:13.833
<i>and clarity to your mind.</i>

02:01:24.073 --> 02:01:25.033
<i>My God.</i>

02:01:25.793 --> 02:01:29.393
<i>Eliminate the traps</i>
<i>on our path of holy war.</i>

02:01:30.513 --> 02:01:33.113
<i>Grant us wakefulness against the enemy.</i>

02:01:34.353 --> 02:01:35.313
<i>My God.</i>

02:01:36.073 --> 02:01:40.873
<i>Give our weapons the strength of Zülfikar</i>
<i>and give our hearts the courage of Ali.</i>

02:01:41.753 --> 02:01:46.353
<i>Don't let anyone who wants to ruin our</i>
<i>brotherhood, unity and peace succeed.</i>

02:01:47.593 --> 02:01:51.153
<i>We ask only for your help</i>
<i>and we kneel down in front of you alone.</i>

02:01:52.113 --> 02:01:53.833
<i>Don't let us be without you, my God.</i>

02:01:54.673 --> 02:01:56.753
<i>My God.</i>

02:03:10.513 --> 02:03:11.953
Today is the day, brother.

02:03:13.833 --> 02:03:18.073
When we clean Jerusalem
of the Muslims, that'll be our day.

02:03:19.433 --> 02:03:21.913
When we reclaim the Temple of Solomon.

02:03:22.993 --> 02:03:26.793
As long as there are knights
such as you... the day is close.

02:03:28.713 --> 02:03:31.193
Soon our nemesis Ertuğrul will arrive.

02:03:32.433 --> 02:03:35.353
Sometimes our enemies
become our closest friends.

02:03:36.513 --> 02:03:38.753
We might have to make deals with them.

02:03:39.433 --> 02:03:41.993
Will you accept his offer
of establishing a rug house?

02:03:42.473 --> 02:03:45.113
Why shouldn't I if he comes up
with a good offer?

02:03:46.793 --> 02:03:48.113
Ural will be enraged.

02:03:49.593 --> 02:03:50.553
Good.

02:03:52.153 --> 02:03:53.673
Then things will go crazy.

02:03:56.233 --> 02:03:59.713
We'll kill two birds with one stone.

02:04:20.353 --> 02:04:24.113
Maria won't leave Turgut's side.
I guess she's fallen for the man.

02:04:24.873 --> 02:04:27.873
Was it Maria who found Turgut
when he was wounded?

02:04:28.673 --> 02:04:30.153
Philip was with her too.

02:04:30.433 --> 02:04:34.113
So either of them might
have found the dagger.

02:04:35.033 --> 02:04:36.353
Is that what you're saying?

02:04:37.273 --> 02:04:40.953
Maria is a naive woman.
She wouldn't understand.

02:04:42.273 --> 02:04:44.353
How would she know
about Batuhan's dagger?

02:04:45.873 --> 02:04:49.553
Only Philip could be behind something
like this. And if Philip is involved...

02:04:49.793 --> 02:04:53.273
-It means Simon is involved too.
-Don't doubt it.

02:04:54.193 --> 02:04:57.113
-Did you get the thief I asked you for?
-It was very easy.

02:04:57.433 --> 02:05:01.313
I only had to say there would be
gemstones in the pouch he always carries.

02:05:02.073 --> 02:05:03.033
Then...

02:05:07.393 --> 02:05:08.393
I'll be back.

02:05:09.793 --> 02:05:11.513
I'll wait for you, my Ural.

02:05:11.873 --> 02:05:13.633
I can't bear being without you.

02:05:52.313 --> 02:05:55.233
Bey, they are bent on causing hell.

02:06:13.793 --> 02:06:17.833
For Christ's sake, for Muhammad's sake,
give some money to this poor man.

02:06:21.193 --> 02:06:24.073
Ever since the birds started perching
on the master's balcony

02:06:24.233 --> 02:06:26.113
the crows have gone mad.

02:06:27.913 --> 02:06:30.793
May God and all his saints be
on your side, brave man.

02:06:31.473 --> 02:06:35.433
May God protect the believers
and those who fight in his name, old man.

02:06:55.433 --> 02:06:57.313
Bey, where are we going?

02:06:57.833 --> 02:07:00.433
-I'd like to see Turgut.
-I understand, bey.

02:07:00.833 --> 02:07:05.833
Shouldn't we take care of our business
first and go see him later?

02:07:08.073 --> 02:07:12.393
I miss my brother too but we don't
know what's waiting in there for us.

02:07:12.673 --> 02:07:16.553
Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
Innkeeper Simon is waiting for you.

02:07:22.913 --> 02:07:23.873
Fine, then.

02:07:52.793 --> 02:07:55.873
What happened to your foot, Philip?
You're limping.

02:07:57.033 --> 02:07:59.513
The work of an arrogant drunk.

02:08:01.313 --> 02:08:02.833
I suppose you put him in his place.

02:09:36.873 --> 02:09:38.193
<i>A Bey's skill lies in</i>

02:09:38.273 --> 02:09:42.673
<i>knowing if the devil is coming from</i>
<i>the right side or the left side.</i>

02:09:52.873 --> 02:09:54.913
I am Suleyman Shah's son Ertuğrul!

02:09:57.273 --> 02:09:59.113
I want all the world to know...

02:10:01.713 --> 02:10:03.713
that any fool who
hankers after what's mine...

02:10:07.433 --> 02:10:08.593
will pay the penalty.
