WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 90 will start after 12:30 min.

12:44.428 --> 12:45.868
We keep encountering each other.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.468
And you keep running away, Vasilius.

13:00.868 --> 13:04.788
So, you took your Sultan
for a walk on my land, huh?

13:08.788 --> 13:11.348
To think my fate would allow me
to see both of you together.

13:23.188 --> 13:26.508
You can't see our Sultan,
even in your dreams, Vasilius.

13:56.268 --> 13:57.468
This, again?

13:58.228 --> 14:00.108
It's a trap! Attack!

15:17.388 --> 15:18.388
This is...

15:20.668 --> 15:23.708
how to ambush.

15:59.668 --> 16:00.908
They are everywhere.

16:01.068 --> 16:02.148
Everywhere!

16:40.708 --> 16:43.028
Come on, everybody!

17:35.548 --> 17:36.788
Ertuğrul!

17:39.988 --> 17:45.388
One of us must die today.

19:49.748 --> 19:51.708
<i>May I enter, Halime Sultan?</i>

19:52.068 --> 19:53.188
Come in, Artuk Bey.

20:01.268 --> 20:05.468
-Any news from Ertuğrul Bey?
-Thank God Ibn Arabi

20:05.548 --> 20:07.628
-cured our Sultan.
-Thank God!

20:07.708 --> 20:10.908
And he saved Ertuğrul Bey
as soon as he got up.

20:11.068 --> 20:12.428
Thank God!

20:12.588 --> 20:14.188
Where is he now? At the inn?

20:14.308 --> 20:16.668
He took off with our men

20:16.788 --> 20:19.348
to catch Vasilius.

20:20.308 --> 20:23.908
He wants us to join
with the soldiers from Cavdar Tribe,

20:24.388 --> 20:26.228
and protect our Sultan.

20:27.268 --> 20:31.148
I will send our soldiers to the Sultan
along with Dündar Bey.

20:32.508 --> 20:34.108
Go fast, Dündar Bey.

20:34.748 --> 20:37.188
Don't leave the Sultan alone.

20:39.268 --> 20:40.748
May God help you.

20:44.428 --> 20:45.748
I leave the tribe to you, Artuk Bey.

20:46.868 --> 20:48.628
Go safely, Dündar Bey.

20:55.828 --> 20:57.388
My God!

23:02.268 --> 23:04.708
It's time for you to die, Vasilius.

23:17.268 --> 23:20.508
You may kill me,

23:21.028 --> 23:25.028
but our empire
will live forever, Ertuğrul.

23:27.388 --> 23:29.308
For God!

23:38.548 --> 23:39.708
Sir!

24:05.668 --> 24:07.068
God's blessing.

24:11.148 --> 24:12.268
Men!

24:12.428 --> 24:13.548
Sir!

24:14.948 --> 24:16.108
Sir!

24:21.108 --> 24:22.708
Retreat!

24:24.868 --> 24:25.868
Protect our bey!

24:25.948 --> 24:27.228
Retreat!

24:27.508 --> 24:28.908
Bamsi! Abdur Rahman!

24:43.948 --> 24:45.068
Sir, are you all right?

24:45.228 --> 24:47.548
Turgut, pull the arrow.

24:48.068 --> 24:50.588
You will lose a lot of blood
if I pull it, sir.

24:50.788 --> 24:52.308
Take it out, Turgut.

24:52.748 --> 24:54.228
Or else, Vasilius will get away.

24:55.868 --> 24:57.108
Go on.

25:06.908 --> 25:08.468
Bear with me, sir.

25:09.028 --> 25:10.468
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

25:14.308 --> 25:15.868
For God!

26:06.748 --> 26:11.268
I sent my men to save Vasilius,
Your Highness.

26:11.908 --> 26:14.268
They won't return
before they kill Ertuğrul.

26:16.708 --> 26:19.348
Do you trust those men?

26:19.548 --> 26:24.108
They took this job on my orders.
They won't budge.

26:27.468 --> 26:28.548
Good.

26:29.468 --> 26:30.428
Great.

26:31.828 --> 26:33.428
I don't want any trouble, Cabir.

26:34.188 --> 26:36.828
Tell your men to be alert.

26:37.428 --> 26:38.388
Yes, sir.

26:39.388 --> 26:40.788
<i>May I enter?</i>

26:45.188 --> 26:46.388
Come in.

27:00.948 --> 27:03.188
Sultan wants to see you, Your Highness.

27:10.588 --> 27:11.788
Leave.

27:12.268 --> 27:13.388
I said leave!

27:47.788 --> 27:48.828
Commander Nikolas!

27:50.388 --> 27:52.868
A message from the men
watching over the market.

27:53.148 --> 27:54.108
What is it?

27:54.508 --> 27:57.988
Their Sultan is gone,
but they are still on alert.

27:58.588 --> 28:00.388
Its looks like
they're expecting another attack.

28:00.708 --> 28:03.188
If their Sultan is not there,
what's all this fuss about?

28:04.588 --> 28:08.268
What if the Sultan never actually left?

28:08.908 --> 28:09.908
But how?

28:10.148 --> 28:11.308
Ertuğrul...

28:12.068 --> 28:13.188
He deceived us.

28:13.308 --> 28:16.508
They lured Governor Vasilius
and our men to themselves.

28:17.388 --> 28:19.988
They knew we were going to
attack the inn to kill the Sultan.

28:20.388 --> 28:21.668
They prevented it.

28:22.228 --> 28:24.068
What should we do now,
Commander Nikolas?

28:24.388 --> 28:27.068
We won't wait for the Governor
and attack the inn ourselves.

28:27.708 --> 28:31.228
It won't be long before they find out
that Ertuğrul Bey tricked

28:31.348 --> 28:32.748
Governor Vasilius, Ameer.

28:34.028 --> 28:37.348
Once they find out, they will attack
the marketplace.

28:39.028 --> 28:42.148
I've taken some measures of my own,
Your Highness.

28:43.508 --> 28:48.668
You may rest to recover
from that cursed poison.

28:50.508 --> 28:52.068
I'm okay, Sadettin.

28:57.668 --> 28:59.028
I'm okay.

29:00.868 --> 29:01.988
I'm more worried about

29:03.348 --> 29:06.588
the traitor among us.

29:08.588 --> 29:14.268
With respect, sir, we don't know
who poisoned you, or when.

29:14.668 --> 29:16.988
You visited both tribes.

29:17.588 --> 29:23.268
It's possible that this disaster
happened in either of the tribes.

29:23.828 --> 29:26.468
However, we will find the culprit.

29:27.628 --> 29:32.028
I thought that traitor was
among us, at the inn.

29:35.588 --> 29:38.508
Even so, we will bring him to justice.

29:40.948 --> 29:45.388
I'll find out who
orchestrated this, Sadettin.

30:29.948 --> 30:31.148
Come here, brother.

30:53.188 --> 30:56.148
What do we do? We stop the bleeding.

30:57.068 --> 30:58.188
We need to stop the bleeding.

31:00.308 --> 31:02.428
-Thank you, brother.
-Come on.

31:07.188 --> 31:08.348
Sir!

31:11.388 --> 31:12.508
Sir!

31:14.068 --> 31:16.028
Sir! Sir!

31:17.868 --> 31:19.028
Sir!

31:19.108 --> 31:20.228
Who were they, Bamsi?

31:20.348 --> 31:23.068
I have no idea who they might be, sir.

31:23.148 --> 31:25.668
We got two of them, but
the other three got away.

31:26.828 --> 31:30.148
They were trained archers,
they wouldn't let us move, sir.

31:31.588 --> 31:33.628
Vasilius got away once again.

31:34.428 --> 31:37.068
That coward! Let's go after him.

31:38.508 --> 31:42.708
Günküt, Dumrul,
tend to your wounds first.

31:43.188 --> 31:44.948
Take the injured men to the inn.

31:45.508 --> 31:47.628
And tell our Sultan what happened here.

31:47.708 --> 31:48.908
Yes, sir.

31:48.988 --> 31:52.788
Bamsi, Turgut,
we will go after Vasilius.

31:52.948 --> 31:54.388
Take two men each.

31:55.308 --> 31:56.388
Come on.

32:16.148 --> 32:18.268
We have horses this way, sir.

32:20.508 --> 32:21.788
Fool! We won't run away.

32:22.388 --> 32:26.628
They will come after us.
We will end this today.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.388
One of us dies!

32:29.268 --> 32:33.548
This will be the last battle.
And it will be the Sultan's turn next.

32:35.548 --> 32:36.508
This way.

32:37.268 --> 32:38.308
This way!

32:51.388 --> 32:52.988
No soldiers, they are defenseless.

32:53.268 --> 32:55.748
Ready the men
to sneak through the stream bed.

32:55.948 --> 32:57.228
Yes, sir.

32:57.788 --> 32:59.108
On your horses!

33:00.108 --> 33:01.108
Come on!

33:06.348 --> 33:10.108
Commander Nikolas, soldiers from
Kayi and Çavdar are going to the inn.

33:10.548 --> 33:13.068
That damned Turk!

33:14.308 --> 33:15.788
Before we realized his plans

33:15.908 --> 33:17.948
he called for backup from their tribes.

33:18.268 --> 33:20.468
They have more men than us now, sir.

33:21.068 --> 33:22.388
We can't win if we attack.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.508
If they know that we are here,
they will attack first.

33:27.388 --> 33:29.148
Today is not the day for our victory.

33:29.748 --> 33:32.348
Let's pray that Governor Vasilius
gets back to the fortress safely.

33:32.668 --> 33:35.748
What if Ertuğrul ambushed him?

33:36.188 --> 33:37.748
We don't know where they went.

33:39.028 --> 33:40.388
We left the fortress defenseless.

33:40.508 --> 33:41.708
We must go back!

34:23.148 --> 34:26.588
Turgut, Bamsi. Be careful.

34:27.388 --> 34:29.668
Vasilius is not alone.

34:36.148 --> 34:37.668
Whoever those bastards were,

34:38.188 --> 34:40.748
he will want to group up
and ambush us.

34:42.348 --> 34:43.668
Our day has come, sir.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.348
This ambush will be his grave.

34:50.708 --> 34:52.988
Come on! Come on!

35:04.588 --> 35:06.948
What happened after I was poisoned, Aziz?

35:07.788 --> 35:08.948
Tell me everything.

35:10.428 --> 35:13.348
Ameer Sadettin imprisoned
Ertuğrul Bey first.

35:14.108 --> 35:17.348
Ibn Arabi, who you invited here, tried to

35:17.668 --> 35:20.908
heal you after he heard what happened.

35:21.948 --> 35:23.388
However...

35:25.508 --> 35:27.068
What is it?

35:30.668 --> 35:31.948
Ameer Sadettin

35:32.268 --> 35:35.828
didn't let him in
thinking about your safety, Your Highness.

35:36.748 --> 35:39.828
He wanted to protect me
from that holy man?

35:41.628 --> 35:43.828
If Ertuğrul Bey's soldiers
had not insisted,

35:43.988 --> 35:46.388
he was going to throw Ibn Arabi out

35:46.988 --> 35:49.788
along with the soldiers,
Your Highness.

35:50.428 --> 35:53.668
I stepped out of line and
opposed Ameer's orders.

35:54.188 --> 35:56.988
And let Ibn Arabi in, Your Highness.

35:57.868 --> 36:00.668
Why did he imprison Ertuğrul Bey?

36:01.948 --> 36:03.548
Did he tell you anything?

36:05.628 --> 36:07.468
He said he didn't trust him.

36:08.468 --> 36:11.588
When the chief physician
couldn't do anything,

36:11.908 --> 36:15.108
I insisted that Ibn Arabi
treat you, Your Highness.

36:16.588 --> 36:19.028
You did the right thing, Aziz.

36:20.268 --> 36:21.468
Rest at ease.

36:35.308 --> 36:36.668
Your Highness.

36:38.908 --> 36:40.228
Dündar Bey has come.

36:40.708 --> 36:41.828
Let him in.

36:53.468 --> 36:55.868
Dündar Bey, His Highness wants to see you.

37:12.308 --> 37:15.668
On Ertuğrul Bey's orders
we have come to ensure your safety, sir.

37:16.228 --> 37:17.908
Men of Kayi and Cavdar tribes

37:18.108 --> 37:20.068
are ready to die for your safety,
Your Highness.

37:21.948 --> 37:25.708
I see in your eyes the same brilliance
as I do in your brother's, Dündar Bey.

37:27.188 --> 37:29.628
If God permits it,
Ertuğrul Bey's brilliance

37:29.868 --> 37:31.668
will give merry hell

37:31.908 --> 37:34.428
to those arrogant bastards.

37:35.268 --> 37:38.348
I've no doubt that Ertuğrul Bey
will emerge victorious.

37:39.468 --> 37:40.708
I'd hope so, Your Highness.

37:41.308 --> 37:44.228
Because this is the moment of truth.

37:45.188 --> 37:48.148
May your leadership long continue
so that our nation may be everlasting.

37:52.188 --> 37:53.228
Your Highness.

37:53.868 --> 37:55.068
With your permission,

37:55.188 --> 37:57.468
Hayme Hatun and Aslıhan Hatun
would also like to see you.

37:58.988 --> 38:00.428
Let them in.

38:22.908 --> 38:24.548
Stop!

38:24.828 --> 38:26.428
This would make a good ambush spot.

38:26.828 --> 38:30.068
They'll probably
follow our tracks anyway.

38:30.588 --> 38:32.188
But sir, they outnumber us.

38:32.668 --> 38:34.508
The archers dealt with most of them.

38:35.108 --> 38:36.148
We've the same numbers.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.948
We still don't know who
those archers were, sir.

38:39.228 --> 38:40.348
They can't be our men.

38:41.868 --> 38:44.948
Whoever they were, what's important
is that they saved us.

38:45.588 --> 38:48.388
I think that they are
Ameer Sadettin's men.

38:50.228 --> 38:52.468
Only Ameer Sadettin
could have sent help to us.

38:53.428 --> 38:54.388
But, how could he?

38:55.148 --> 38:57.908
He's probably helping us to

38:58.668 --> 38:59.868
stop Ertuğrul in his tracks.

39:01.468 --> 39:02.468
Scatter around!

39:02.708 --> 39:04.068
Scatter! Take your positions.

39:04.148 --> 39:05.268
In your positions!

39:25.908 --> 39:27.108
Would you like to sit?

39:38.748 --> 39:40.468
As I was fighting for my life,

39:41.348 --> 39:44.988
it is said, Sadettin threw
your men out with force.

39:46.948 --> 39:50.588
Despite that, you still came
with the other Turkmen beys

39:50.708 --> 39:51.948
to the Hanlı Bazaar.

39:54.908 --> 39:55.988
We would never

39:56.588 --> 39:59.388
leave you or Ertuğrul Bey alone,
Your Highness.

40:01.708 --> 40:04.828
Thank God Arabi cured you.

40:07.268 --> 40:09.908
What would you have done if Ibn Arabi

40:10.428 --> 40:13.708
couldn't save my life, and Ameer Sadettin
continued to blame Ertuğrul Bey?

40:14.308 --> 40:16.228
What would you do then?

40:17.108 --> 40:18.108
Then,

40:18.428 --> 40:21.988
we'd insist on the path
we think to be true, Your Highness.

40:22.508 --> 40:24.588
Our ardor and faith

40:25.108 --> 40:26.868
in our country

40:27.148 --> 40:29.908
would not allow us to
let you or Ertuğrul Bey fall prey

40:30.068 --> 40:32.268
to Ameer Sadettin's mistake,
Your Highness.

40:32.988 --> 40:36.028
We have seen many a great nation fall

40:36.348 --> 40:41.628
due to the weakness of their

40:41.748 --> 40:43.188
respective ameers.

40:43.388 --> 40:44.588
If Artuk Bey

40:44.708 --> 40:48.428
had not insisted on Arabi treating you,

40:48.948 --> 40:49.908
and if we had not

40:50.308 --> 40:54.868
tried to convince Ameer Sadettin
that he was being mistaken,

40:55.348 --> 41:00.188
then both Ameer Sadettin and
our country would have been weakened.

41:03.068 --> 41:07.708
And you would go against the man
you are going to marry, Aslıhan Hatun?

41:08.308 --> 41:09.708
We would not stop

41:10.228 --> 41:11.948
to think and go against the whole world

41:12.108 --> 41:14.828
if it's for you and Ertuğrul Bey's sakes.

41:18.188 --> 41:19.188
Plus...

41:20.748 --> 41:22.948
I won't be marrying Ameer Sadettin.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.108
Is that so?

41:28.788 --> 41:33.548
I voiced my wishes to lead the tribe
that my brother entrusted me with.

41:34.748 --> 41:36.508
I respectfully told him

41:36.868 --> 41:38.788
that even if our revenge is taken,

41:39.188 --> 41:42.428
and Karacahisar is conquered,
I'm never going to leave my tribe.

41:44.188 --> 41:46.908
I'm the last child of my father,
the very bey of the Cavdars.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.428
It'd be improper to leave, Your Highness.

41:53.348 --> 41:55.708
I'll forever hold that what keeps

41:55.908 --> 41:59.228
my country on its feet is you, the women.

42:02.468 --> 42:06.948
You don't just give birth
to those brave men.

42:07.428 --> 42:08.588
You raise them

42:08.948 --> 42:11.748
and you're also battle ready
on their side at all times.

42:12.388 --> 42:17.588
God bless you women,
who keep our nation alive.

42:28.508 --> 42:30.348
Come now, Ertuğrul.

42:32.708 --> 42:33.988
Come to your death.

42:50.908 --> 42:54.308
It's like that coward hid in a hole.

42:54.948 --> 42:57.148
Where could he disappear
to in the blink of an eye?

42:57.828 --> 42:59.668
It's like he vanished into thin air.

43:11.348 --> 43:13.708
Sir, I saw horses by the stream bed.

43:14.228 --> 43:15.548
It's their horses.

43:17.908 --> 43:19.028
They are still here.

43:21.548 --> 43:23.588
Keep watch on us from afar.

43:24.148 --> 43:26.108
It looks like Vasilius
wants to ambush us.

43:26.388 --> 43:27.588
Yes, sir.

43:27.868 --> 43:29.148
As you wish, sir.

43:30.348 --> 43:31.788
Let's go.

44:01.708 --> 44:03.228
God, help us.

44:03.868 --> 44:05.188
Help us, God.

44:06.228 --> 44:07.188
Commander.

44:09.068 --> 44:10.068
What happened?

44:10.188 --> 44:12.468
Ertuğrul fooled both us
and Governor Vasilius.

44:12.948 --> 44:14.988
What do you mean? Where is Vasilius?

44:15.228 --> 44:17.788
I don’t know.
I don't know, Ekaterina. Got it?

44:23.028 --> 44:24.068
Commander Nikolas.

44:24.348 --> 44:27.188
One of the soldiers that went with
Vasilius has arrived.

44:27.268 --> 44:28.228
Let him in right away.

44:28.388 --> 44:29.588
Yes, sir.

44:32.028 --> 44:33.148
Guards!

44:39.108 --> 44:41.268
Tell me what happened now!
Where is Vasilius?

44:41.548 --> 44:44.068
Sir, Ertuğrul fooled us once again.

44:44.628 --> 44:47.228
The man with him wasn't Sultan Alaeddin.

44:47.868 --> 44:50.588
I knew it! Damn it!

44:51.788 --> 44:53.108
We fought hard.

44:53.668 --> 44:56.788
Governor managed to get away
with the few soldiers left alive.

44:57.908 --> 45:01.108
If the archers had not come just in time

45:01.708 --> 45:02.788
we'd all have died.

45:02.948 --> 45:03.948
What archers?

45:04.348 --> 45:05.388
Who were they?

45:05.708 --> 45:06.668
We don't know.

45:06.828 --> 45:10.348
So that means we are not
fighting damned Ertuğrul alone.

45:10.828 --> 45:13.108
-Do you know where they are?
-Yes, sir.

45:13.188 --> 45:15.148
Send them reinforcements right away!

45:17.788 --> 45:19.068
Guards!

45:19.828 --> 45:22.748
You still can't tell your friends
from your foes.

45:23.908 --> 45:27.308
You still haven't figured out
whose men those archers are.

45:30.068 --> 45:32.308
Just pray that nothing
happens to Vasilius,

45:32.828 --> 45:34.068
because then

45:34.788 --> 45:37.628
Ertuğrul would be able to conquer
this fortress with just his men.

45:37.948 --> 45:39.868
If you are so experienced,

45:40.508 --> 45:43.148
tell me who those archers are.

46:30.668 --> 46:33.188
Long live Nicaea!

46:37.468 --> 46:39.788
Long live Nicaea!

46:40.348 --> 46:42.308
You won't live to see it, Vasilius.

47:22.748 --> 47:23.828
Your Highness.

47:24.348 --> 47:26.708
Ertuğrul Bey's injured men have come.

47:27.308 --> 47:29.388
One of them wants to talk to you.

47:29.868 --> 47:30.828
Let him in.

47:51.628 --> 47:52.628
Speak.

47:53.028 --> 47:54.108
What happened?

47:54.548 --> 47:58.148
Your Highness, we beat
Vasilius and his men.

47:59.348 --> 48:01.948
Just as Ertuğrul Bey was
about to kill Vasilius,

48:02.948 --> 48:05.468
some men came to Vasilius' rescue.

48:06.348 --> 48:08.788
They shot Ertuğrul Bey with bows.

48:14.468 --> 48:17.668
May God protect them.

48:20.708 --> 48:22.028
Who were those archers?

48:22.708 --> 48:24.428
We have no idea, Your Highness.

48:24.668 --> 48:26.828
However, our men went after them.

48:28.148 --> 48:29.468
Where is Ertuğrul Bey?

48:29.748 --> 48:30.988
Vasilius got away.

48:31.548 --> 48:34.188
Ertuğrul Bey and his men went after him.

48:34.748 --> 48:37.228
He sent me to let you know, Your Highness.

48:40.308 --> 48:41.348
May God

48:42.108 --> 48:44.068
help them.

49:25.588 --> 49:27.148
Not this time, you bastards!

50:15.628 --> 50:17.588
Ertuğrul got away.

50:22.268 --> 50:23.388
Again.

50:28.988 --> 50:32.348
Cabir, why did your esteemed soldiers

50:32.948 --> 50:35.028
fail to carry it out?

50:36.228 --> 50:39.028
Those soldiers have no fear of death,
Your Highness.

50:39.388 --> 50:41.308
They won't let Ertuğrul escape.

50:41.508 --> 50:43.388
They won't come back
unless they kill him

50:43.668 --> 50:45.468
or die trying.

50:47.228 --> 50:48.668
Everybody dies.

50:49.068 --> 50:50.308
Right, Cabir?

50:50.508 --> 50:53.868
Unless they accomplish their mission,
what use is it if they die?

50:54.228 --> 50:55.188
Who cares?

50:57.828 --> 51:00.388
They would die in vain.

51:02.188 --> 51:03.348
Your Highness.

51:03.788 --> 51:07.108
We know that Ertuğrul Bey
went after Vasilius with few men.

51:07.588 --> 51:09.348
Many of his men returned heavily injured.

51:09.868 --> 51:12.068
My soldiers will carry it out.

51:12.588 --> 51:15.148
It seems you don't know
Ertuğrul yet, Cabir.

51:15.948 --> 51:17.388
They only had one chance.

51:17.788 --> 51:21.188
If they could have done it the first time,
it was over.

51:22.228 --> 51:23.508
Now, it's too late.

51:27.188 --> 51:29.148
Ertuğrul must be prepared now.

51:32.508 --> 51:33.468
Just pray that

51:34.428 --> 51:38.188
he doesn't catch your soldiers alive.

51:45.428 --> 51:46.468
Get out!

52:24.508 --> 52:25.748
Reso, come on!

52:58.748 --> 53:01.068
Long live hell for all tyrants!

53:43.367 --> 53:44.567
Tell me, Ekaterina.

53:45.327 --> 53:47.487
Who went for Vasilius's rescue?

53:49.047 --> 53:50.647
Emir Sadettin.

53:52.247 --> 53:53.967
What did you just say?

53:54.927 --> 53:57.167
-It's impossible.
-It is not, Nikolas.

53:58.087 --> 54:01.927
Your biggest ally against the sultan
and Ertuğrul will be Emir Sadettin.

54:02.887 --> 54:05.687
If we don't put his support
to good use, we'll lose the fortress.

54:06.767 --> 54:09.647
We won't let them take it.
Vasilius will be back.

54:09.767 --> 54:12.167
In all likelihood, Ertuğrul
probably caught him already.

54:12.887 --> 54:17.367
And he will probably have killed him
before your men reach them.

54:18.447 --> 54:19.847
What happens afterwards, Nikolas?

54:21.087 --> 54:23.007
The Turks will make for this place
right away.

54:23.727 --> 54:25.167
They can't breach our walls.

54:27.287 --> 54:29.087
There is not even a crack in the walls.

54:30.007 --> 54:31.567
We doubled the guards.

54:31.967 --> 54:33.167
We will ask for reinforcements.

54:34.167 --> 54:35.567
You still don't get it.

54:36.207 --> 54:40.407
What wins wars is not numbers
but the commander's brains.

54:41.007 --> 54:43.567
And what are you basing
your assumptions on?

54:44.287 --> 54:46.447
You just came here, Nikolas.

54:47.087 --> 54:48.967
But I've lived with them for years.

54:49.447 --> 54:51.087
I know how they think well.

54:51.927 --> 54:54.967
I won't let them take my father's legacy.

54:55.167 --> 54:56.167
But how?

54:57.927 --> 55:00.727
We will kill Ertuğrul
with Emir Sadettin's help.

55:02.567 --> 55:03.727
There's no other way.

55:04.207 --> 55:06.367
Why would Emir Sadettin,
the vizier of the Seljuks,

55:06.807 --> 55:09.127
help us kill Ertuğrul?

55:09.887 --> 55:13.007
Ertuğrul's success is driving him crazy.

55:13.807 --> 55:15.967
He'd do anything to put an end to him.

55:16.407 --> 55:18.687
The archers he sent is proves it.

55:19.087 --> 55:21.007
He made a deal with my husband before.

55:21.687 --> 55:23.487
Now, he'll make a deal with me.

55:24.287 --> 55:25.927
We won't give up our fortress.

55:26.327 --> 55:27.727
Vasilius will return.

55:27.927 --> 55:30.687
-And if he doesn't--
-If he doesn't, Nikolas,

55:31.607 --> 55:33.727
I will take command of this fortress.

55:41.487 --> 55:44.007
It's over, sir. He died.

55:46.447 --> 55:47.967
We have avenged...

55:49.127 --> 55:50.487
Brother Doğan...

55:51.727 --> 55:53.487
and brother Aliyar,

55:54.127 --> 55:55.967
along with many others that died.

56:00.527 --> 56:02.727
Rest in peace, Doğan.

56:06.447 --> 56:07.527
May your soul...

56:07.807 --> 56:10.007
rest in peace.

56:10.927 --> 56:12.927
Rest in peace, Aliyar Bey.

56:18.007 --> 56:21.247
We will take Vasilius's body to the inn.

56:24.087 --> 56:26.687
Samsa, make for the fortress.

56:28.047 --> 56:32.487
Tell them that they should
take the governor's corpse.

56:33.087 --> 56:34.287
Yes, sir.

56:34.967 --> 56:36.487
Now that we destroyed these tyrants,

56:37.447 --> 56:39.647
our people will be proud of you.

56:40.727 --> 56:41.727
It's not our victory,

56:43.127 --> 56:44.527
but God's himself, Samsa.

56:47.207 --> 56:51.807
As long as we fight in his name,
nobody can beat us.

56:54.087 --> 56:55.047
However,

56:56.167 --> 56:58.287
if, one day, we think that
it is our victory...

56:59.527 --> 57:01.487
and forget about our cause,

57:02.647 --> 57:04.567
and if we tarnish our cause with...

57:05.127 --> 57:08.127
riches and reputation,

57:09.647 --> 57:10.767
then...

57:13.767 --> 57:15.767
God will make sure we end up the same.

57:19.207 --> 57:21.127
Listen to me well now.

57:24.167 --> 57:25.287
Neither my heart...

57:25.847 --> 57:29.087
nor my men's hearts
can carry more than one love.

57:30.447 --> 57:33.527
We will think and speak what we think.

57:34.967 --> 57:36.487
We will walk the path...

57:37.287 --> 57:38.887
for the same goal.

57:45.247 --> 57:46.887
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

57:47.447 --> 57:48.847
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

57:49.407 --> 57:51.047
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

57:51.367 --> 57:53.047
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

57:53.247 --> 57:55.087
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

57:55.287 --> 57:56.847
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

57:57.287 --> 57:58.887
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

57:59.247 --> 58:00.887
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

58:07.807 --> 58:09.607
God bless, look at him.

58:29.247 --> 58:30.607
There is still no news...

58:31.087 --> 58:33.007
from Ertuğrul Bey or the others.

58:34.407 --> 58:36.407
I wonder if something happened to them?

58:36.647 --> 58:38.007
God forbid.

58:38.127 --> 58:39.927
Don't talk like that, Hafsa Hatun.

58:40.607 --> 58:42.167
We will get their good news soon.

58:42.687 --> 58:44.087
Don't you worry.

58:45.767 --> 58:47.087
Whenever...

58:47.567 --> 58:52.287
Bamsi goes to a battle,
I feel like I'm going with him to fight.

58:54.487 --> 58:56.247
It's such a heavy weight.

58:57.647 --> 58:59.847
The wife of an alp
must be strong, Hafsa.

59:01.127 --> 59:02.567
She must keep her head high.

59:02.887 --> 59:04.847
And control her impulses.

59:05.607 --> 59:07.007
Let the wind and waters...

59:07.847 --> 59:09.487
take your worries away,

59:10.047 --> 59:13.847
so that when he is back from fighting,
you can welcome him with a smile.

59:15.167 --> 59:17.487
Is this how it's going to keep on going,
Halime Sultan?

59:21.967 --> 59:24.567
The cycle of separation and reunion
is our fate, Hafsa.

59:26.167 --> 59:31.367
That's why we must always
be patient and strong.

59:31.967 --> 59:33.887
Banu Çiçek!

59:34.007 --> 59:35.927
-Banu Çiçek!
-Banu Çiçek!

59:38.727 --> 59:40.087
It's coming!

59:41.287 --> 59:42.887
My baby is coming!

59:47.927 --> 59:50.247
Hafsa, quick. Call the midwives.

59:50.447 --> 59:53.167
-Have them come at once.
-Yes, Halime Sultan.

59:55.527 --> 59:58.407
Are you okay? Here, lean back.

00:59:59.047 --> 01:00:01.807
Lie down and stretch out your feet.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.527
It's time, Halime.

01:00:11.127 --> 01:00:12.327
Your Highness.

01:00:13.887 --> 01:00:16.927
Men like me wear a burial robe
as their clothes.

01:00:18.407 --> 01:00:20.647
That cloth wraps this poor body of mine,

01:00:21.647 --> 01:00:23.687
and I'd lay my life down for you anytime.

01:00:26.367 --> 01:00:29.527
This inn belongs to Ertuğrul Bey,
and you were his guest.

01:00:29.767 --> 01:00:31.127
Anyone would have done the same.

01:00:32.207 --> 01:00:36.847
Did you protect me from a holy man's vice
like Ibn Arabi did, Sadettin?

01:00:37.247 --> 01:00:41.847
Or did you protect me from Ertuğrul Bey,
whom I trust more than

01:00:42.087 --> 01:00:47.247
most other emirs and commanders,
and who I bestowed with more power?

01:00:50.887 --> 01:00:52.847
Answer! Why did you do it?

01:00:53.927 --> 01:00:58.087
If Ibn Arabi had not made it in time
and saved my life, do you know

01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:59.607
what would have happened?

01:01:01.767 --> 01:01:06.767
Turkmen beys were going to take
Ertuğrul Bey from you with force.

01:01:07.287 --> 01:01:11.967
Because in their eyes, Ertuğrul Bey is
way more honorable than you.

01:01:13.607 --> 01:01:17.127
If I had died, Sadettin, not even
the crusader army

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.487
could have hurt my country

01:01:20.007 --> 01:01:23.007
more than you would have,
let alone the emperor.

01:01:29.647 --> 01:01:31.967
You wronged me, Sadettin.

01:01:35.407 --> 01:01:37.247
Your Highness, I--

01:01:37.367 --> 01:01:40.567
Your mistake would not have
caused just my death,

01:01:41.687 --> 01:01:44.927
but also, the destruction of these lands
and discord between our people.

01:01:48.047 --> 01:01:50.887
I always valued your wisdom,

01:01:51.967 --> 01:01:53.367
and your skills.

01:01:55.567 --> 01:01:59.167
However, you put me and my country...

01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:03.487
in danger when I was in such a sad state.

01:02:16.327 --> 01:02:17.847
Waiting is killing me, Mother.

01:02:22.807 --> 01:02:24.847
Come here.

01:02:31.927 --> 01:02:36.727
I used to wait for my father,
who never stopped fighting.

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:40.087
And then Suleyman Shah.

01:02:42.127 --> 01:02:44.407
And then I waited for my sons.

01:02:46.367 --> 01:02:48.167
And all I could do...

01:02:49.807 --> 01:02:51.727
was to seek refuge in God.

01:03:06.887 --> 01:03:10.567
We are already going through
such hard times.

01:03:11.367 --> 01:03:13.127
And now Emir Sadettin is...

01:03:14.607 --> 01:03:16.567
What did he do again?

01:03:20.687 --> 01:03:23.687
When I told him that I wouldn't marry him,

01:03:23.927 --> 01:03:26.567
he said he'd never give up on me.

01:03:27.207 --> 01:03:30.047
His malice started showing up
in the way he talks.

01:03:31.487 --> 01:03:34.367
And then he made a full circle
to get at Ertuğrul Bey.

01:03:35.127 --> 01:03:38.527
Ertuğrul? What does it have
to do with Ertuğrul?

01:03:40.127 --> 01:03:44.007
He said my faith in Ertuğrul
lead me to take charge of my tribe.

01:03:45.367 --> 01:03:48.367
He thinks I refused his proposition,
because Ertuğrul Bey

01:03:48.487 --> 01:03:50.127
protects me and my tribe.

01:03:53.047 --> 01:03:56.167
To hell with him! That demon!

01:04:00.607 --> 01:04:04.127
-<i>May I enter, Mother?</i>
<i>-</i>Come in, Dündar.

01:04:07.367 --> 01:04:10.647
Ertuğrul Bey and the others
are coming back to the inn.

01:04:11.207 --> 01:04:13.327
Thank God.

01:04:20.687 --> 01:04:24.087
I gather you are not happy
with the measures I took, Your Highness.

01:04:25.087 --> 01:04:30.247
I succumbed when I saw you
wriggling in pain.

01:04:30.927 --> 01:04:33.007
I understand now.

01:04:33.487 --> 01:04:35.647
But I'm ready for my punishment.

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:41.727
I see that you lack the respect
of many Turkmen beys...

01:04:42.607 --> 01:04:46.447
in these lands that I entrusted you,
who I had faith in.

01:04:46.967 --> 01:04:48.247
Your Highness.

01:04:48.887 --> 01:04:52.087
If you have even the slightest
doubt that I won't

01:04:52.247 --> 01:04:54.327
be able to carry out my duty,

01:04:54.927 --> 01:04:56.847
then relieve me of this duty

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:59.807
until the bastard that attempted
this hideous murder is found.

01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:02.167
You may even take my life.

01:05:03.007 --> 01:05:07.247
I'd happily lay my life down for you
and surrender myself to the executioner.

01:05:26.727 --> 01:05:29.887
Your Highness, a messenger from Konya
brought this letter to you.

01:05:53.967 --> 01:05:56.087
They caught the traitor in my palace.

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.407
It was my personal aide Kasim.

01:06:02.247 --> 01:06:03.727
He confessed everything.

01:06:05.247 --> 01:06:08.287
It was he who told the emperor
that I was here.

01:06:10.207 --> 01:06:13.207
Then, the one who orchestrated

01:06:13.847 --> 01:06:16.887
your murder with poison
must have been that lowly Vasilius.

01:06:18.087 --> 01:06:20.487
Only such a lowly man could do
something like this.

01:06:23.687 --> 01:06:28.087
He will dread every moment he's alive
and beg for me to kill him.

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:32.047
As for you, Emir Sadettin.

01:06:33.127 --> 01:06:36.767
If God permits and
Ertuğrul Bey returns in one piece,

01:06:37.967 --> 01:06:39.727
then you will ask for his forgiveness.

01:06:45.887 --> 01:06:47.847
As you wish, Your Highness.

01:06:55.207 --> 01:06:56.607
Your Highness.

01:06:58.247 --> 01:07:00.487
Ertuğrul Bey and his men are coming back.

01:07:02.287 --> 01:07:03.287
Thank God.

01:07:05.007 --> 01:07:06.967
Guards!

01:08:51.927 --> 01:08:53.287
Your Highness.

01:08:53.967 --> 01:08:55.247
Vasilius, who was cruel...

01:08:55.967 --> 01:08:59.927
to both his own people and us,

01:09:00.767 --> 01:09:05.567
and who waged wars against our country,
our faith, and our traditions,

01:09:06.047 --> 01:09:07.767
got what he deserved.

01:09:18.607 --> 01:09:24.127
Brave is the man who sacrifices
his life for his people and country.

01:09:25.527 --> 01:09:26.807
And hero is the one

01:09:27.007 --> 01:09:31.447
that shines the light of hope
on his people in darkest of times.

01:09:32.727 --> 01:09:35.927
Ertuğrul Bey, you became...

01:09:36.767 --> 01:09:41.407
a ray of hope in such hard times
to your people with your courage.

01:09:42.607 --> 01:09:43.887
God bless you.

01:09:47.847 --> 01:09:50.127
Our martyrs have been avenged,
Your Highness.

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:55.367
We got our revenge for the deaths...

01:09:56.247 --> 01:09:59.127
of my brothers Aliyar and Doğan,
as well as many others that died.

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:03.807
Their fortress is left leaderless now.

01:10:08.647 --> 01:10:11.887
A fortress without a leader needs a flag.

01:10:13.247 --> 01:10:17.687
The one who will raise our glorious flag
in the towers of that fortress...

01:10:20.127 --> 01:10:21.807
will be none other than you.

01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:33.407
God bless your victory, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:38.127
You showed dignity and tenacity
in face of the cruel,

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:42.567
and humility in face of the oppressed.

01:10:43.727 --> 01:10:47.887
God heard your wishes and made you
into the leader of the oppressed.

01:10:51.527 --> 01:10:54.887
May God grant you many more victories.

01:10:56.647 --> 01:10:57.927
Amen.

01:10:58.607 --> 01:11:01.007
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:11:07.287 --> 01:11:08.847
Your mother loves you so much.

01:11:10.447 --> 01:11:11.767
Thank God.

01:11:12.087 --> 01:11:13.847
You got rid of yet another problem.

01:11:15.527 --> 01:11:16.847
Thank you, Mother.

01:11:21.007 --> 01:11:22.887
You kept your promise, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:11:23.687 --> 01:11:25.407
You avenged my brother.

01:11:26.247 --> 01:11:27.567
God bless you.

01:11:29.647 --> 01:11:31.847
May you be brave and victorious forever.

01:11:34.287 --> 01:11:35.927
Thank you, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:11:42.767 --> 01:11:45.887
God bless your victory, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:11:47.767 --> 01:11:49.527
With this victory,

01:11:50.167 --> 01:11:53.207
Ertuğrul Bey not only saved
our sultan's life,

01:11:54.327 --> 01:11:58.527
but also proved just how great
a margrave he is.

01:12:05.167 --> 01:12:06.247
Your Highness.

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:08.807
I sent a messenger to the fortress.

01:12:09.567 --> 01:12:12.007
They will take the governor's
body tomorrow.

01:12:13.927 --> 01:12:17.127
I'd like to display his body
to make an example of it,

01:12:17.527 --> 01:12:20.327
if you would allow it.

01:12:22.527 --> 01:12:25.007
The wolf does not hide its prey
like a jackal.

01:12:26.807 --> 01:12:29.327
It's not just appropriate.
It's the right thing to do.

01:13:49.807 --> 01:13:51.767
Thank God.

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:54.447
You got your baby safe and sound.

01:13:55.007 --> 01:13:58.847
We will see you with your baby, too
if God permits, Hafsa Hatun.

01:13:59.927 --> 01:14:01.407
I hope so, Banu Çiçek.

01:14:04.687 --> 01:14:07.207
Ah, Hafsa Hatun.

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:12.247
If only Doğan was here as well...

01:14:15.207 --> 01:14:18.647
If only he could see his baby...

01:14:23.727 --> 01:14:26.327
It's true that he can't see his baby,

01:14:27.287 --> 01:14:30.927
but we will see that our revenge
is taken, Banu Çiçek.

01:14:34.247 --> 01:14:36.727
May God give strength

01:14:37.287 --> 01:14:39.687
to Ertuğrul Bey and his men.

01:14:40.687 --> 01:14:41.767
Amen.

01:14:48.367 --> 01:14:50.527
Come, Halime Sultan.

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:55.847
Bismillah.

01:14:57.287 --> 01:14:59.127
God bless you.

01:14:59.607 --> 01:15:02.167
You didn't leave me alone.

01:15:02.607 --> 01:15:04.887
We all did what we had to do, Banu Çiçek.

01:15:06.567 --> 01:15:09.767
I have good news for you.

01:15:11.967 --> 01:15:12.967
What is it?

01:15:14.607 --> 01:15:19.487
Ertuğrul Bey and his men got back
to the inn, safe and sound.

01:15:20.687 --> 01:15:22.607
Thank God.

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:26.887
Vasilius was brought to justice
by the sword of Ertuğrul Bey.

01:15:29.407 --> 01:15:31.767
He avenged our brave men.

01:15:34.687 --> 01:15:37.207
Vasilius will burn in hell
for all eternity.

01:15:38.487 --> 01:15:40.527
Such good news, Halime Sultan.

01:15:41.687 --> 01:15:45.727
At last, my father and our men
can rest in peace.

01:15:55.607 --> 01:15:57.967
Rest in peace, Doğan.

01:16:00.487 --> 01:16:02.127
You have been avenged.

01:16:06.807 --> 01:16:11.567
Our son will grow up to be
a gallant alp worthy of you.

01:16:34.447 --> 01:16:38.087
The traitor in my palace
told the emperor that I was here.

01:16:39.767 --> 01:16:41.207
And he confessed to this.

01:16:42.527 --> 01:16:45.207
Vasilius could have found a way
to poison me somehow.

01:16:46.327 --> 01:16:47.647
I understand that.

01:16:47.887 --> 01:16:50.407
But after what you said to me,

01:16:51.087 --> 01:16:53.807
I see that this doesn't end there.

01:16:54.487 --> 01:16:56.567
Until we find the archers...

01:16:57.247 --> 01:17:00.567
that appeared out of nowhere
when Vasilius fell into my trap,

01:17:01.327 --> 01:17:03.727
your life will be in danger,
Your Highness.

01:17:04.647 --> 01:17:06.767
Nobody knew that you were going to

01:17:06.887 --> 01:17:09.927
ambush Vasilius outside of this inn,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:17:12.247 --> 01:17:16.007
The vermin responsible for that
is somewhere in the inn, Your Highness.

01:17:17.127 --> 01:17:19.287
It can't be the other tribes you visited.

01:17:21.287 --> 01:17:27.247
All the troubles started with
Sadettin Köpek's arrival at the inn.

01:17:29.767 --> 01:17:33.327
If the traitor in my palace
wasn't caught and confessed it all,

01:17:34.207 --> 01:17:36.127
I'd suspect him as well.

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:39.367
However,
Emir Sadettin didn't know...

01:17:40.047 --> 01:17:41.607
that I was here when he came.

01:17:42.687 --> 01:17:46.487
I don't believe that Emir Sadettin
would work with the traitor in my palace.

01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:51.047
Nevertheless, it's good that
we both know about it.

01:17:56.927 --> 01:17:57.967
Aziz.

01:18:03.367 --> 01:18:04.847
Yes, Your Highness.

01:18:05.767 --> 01:18:07.607
Call Emir Sadettin.

01:18:42.767 --> 01:18:44.007
I thank you...

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:47.287
for letting me in, Aslıhan.

01:18:48.567 --> 01:18:51.287
I consider an emir's request an order.

01:18:54.807 --> 01:18:57.327
Stop this "emir" bullshit, for God's sake.

01:19:00.287 --> 01:19:02.007
I came here as Sadettin.

01:19:03.367 --> 01:19:05.887
A miserable man that's in love with you.

01:19:06.927 --> 01:19:10.567
A man that came to talk to the woman...

01:19:11.207 --> 01:19:15.767
who promised to spend a lifetime with him,
and then turned her back.

01:19:17.167 --> 01:19:19.727
I've already moved past that phase,
Your Highness.

01:19:20.087 --> 01:19:22.167
How many times do I have to tell you?

01:19:22.607 --> 01:19:26.167
Out of respect for my father,
I accepted to be your wife.

01:19:26.847 --> 01:19:30.247
-However, with my brother dead...
-Aliyar Bey's revenge is taken.

01:19:30.647 --> 01:19:31.807
Am I right?

01:19:35.007 --> 01:19:36.607
He has been avenged.

01:19:37.487 --> 01:19:39.647
When will you stop being so stubborn?

01:19:43.087 --> 01:19:45.767
Will you act as the representative
of the great Cavdar tribe

01:19:45.887 --> 01:19:48.447
for the rest of your life?

01:19:49.447 --> 01:19:51.847
What's keeping you there?

01:19:52.927 --> 01:19:54.007
Just what?

01:19:55.807 --> 01:19:59.047
Nobody can take me away from my tribe,
Your Highness.

01:19:59.887 --> 01:20:01.127
Not even you.

01:20:05.287 --> 01:20:07.327
His Highness is waiting for you, sir.

01:20:42.207 --> 01:20:43.607
Still no news.

01:20:44.047 --> 01:20:46.407
And all we can do is sit tight and wait.

01:20:47.967 --> 01:20:49.687
We sent our men.

01:20:49.847 --> 01:20:53.087
We are not just waiting, doing nothing.
We are protecting our fortress.

01:20:53.407 --> 01:20:56.847
To the contrary, you look too dumbfounded
to lift a muscle,

01:20:57.287 --> 01:20:59.007
Commander Nikolas.

01:21:04.407 --> 01:21:07.967
Commander Nikolas, a Turk has come
as the messenger of Ertuğrul Bey.

01:21:08.127 --> 01:21:09.247
Let him in at once.

01:21:26.407 --> 01:21:27.527
Speak, Turk.

01:21:29.647 --> 01:21:31.327
Governor Vasilius is dead.

01:21:35.967 --> 01:21:37.127
What did you say?

01:21:38.807 --> 01:21:40.687
His body is at the inn.

01:21:41.487 --> 01:21:43.367
Ertuğrul Bey wants you to take it.

01:21:45.807 --> 01:21:48.927
No harm will be done
to those that come to take the body.

01:21:49.687 --> 01:21:50.927
That's all.

01:21:51.367 --> 01:21:52.807
Murderers!

01:21:53.167 --> 01:21:55.207
I'll kill you all one by one!

01:21:55.407 --> 01:21:57.727
I'll kill you all one by one!

01:21:58.047 --> 01:22:00.247
Then, you should start with me, Commander.

01:22:00.847 --> 01:22:02.447
If you can, that is.

01:22:03.087 --> 01:22:05.487
Nikolas! Let him go.

01:22:06.847 --> 01:22:09.287
He isn't as valuable as Vasilius's body.

01:22:10.847 --> 01:22:12.567
If you kill him,

01:22:13.487 --> 01:22:16.567
they'll feed the governor's body
to the crows.

01:22:18.287 --> 01:22:19.927
Get the hell out!

01:22:20.447 --> 01:22:21.647
Get out!

01:22:29.007 --> 01:22:30.607
Open the doors!

01:22:43.007 --> 01:22:45.207
Send Artuk Bey to the fortress
as a messenger

01:22:45.287 --> 01:22:46.847
when you go back to your tribe.

01:22:48.287 --> 01:22:50.767
It will be my last call
for them to surrender.

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:54.247
As you wish, Your Highness.

01:23:10.207 --> 01:23:12.087
You sent for me, Your Highness.

01:23:14.207 --> 01:23:15.807
Come, Sadettin.

01:23:28.247 --> 01:23:33.567
Nikolas either surrenders the fortress
or his life, along with those inside.

01:23:35.087 --> 01:23:37.847
My army is on the way for the siege.

01:23:38.727 --> 01:23:41.287
Until my army comes
and my marquee is built,

01:23:41.727 --> 01:23:44.207
I'll continue staying here as a guest.

01:23:46.967 --> 01:23:49.367
That's a great decision, Your Highness.

01:23:50.287 --> 01:23:53.287
It's only appropriate for you
to rest here tonight.

01:23:54.767 --> 01:23:57.327
However, as you have already said,

01:23:57.527 --> 01:24:02.287
it's possible that the traitor
that almost killed you is here.

01:24:04.887 --> 01:24:08.567
If that's so, it's your job
to take measure, Sadettin.

01:24:09.887 --> 01:24:11.527
Leave it to me, Your Highness.

01:24:18.927 --> 01:24:20.047
Your Highness.

01:24:21.367 --> 01:24:24.927
With your permission, I have something
I need to tell Ertuğrul Bey.

01:24:29.527 --> 01:24:33.527
Ertuğrul Bey, I had to make
a weighty decision

01:24:33.927 --> 01:24:36.447
when that disaster took place.

01:24:37.687 --> 01:24:40.887
That's why I thought it was necessary
to take measure

01:24:41.127 --> 01:24:42.887
against you and your men.

01:24:43.567 --> 01:24:46.527
I believe you understand my decision.

01:24:47.527 --> 01:24:49.167
You may not trust me,

01:24:49.927 --> 01:24:54.007
but I expected you to at least
trust Ibn Arabi, Emir Sadettin.

01:24:56.207 --> 01:24:59.967
You and Ibn Arabi have my full faith.

01:25:02.367 --> 01:25:06.887
I know very well just
how important you are

01:25:07.207 --> 01:25:08.847
to our sultan.

01:25:11.287 --> 01:25:14.727
However, as I said, I acted out of duty.

01:25:17.167 --> 01:25:21.567
Your duty, as my emir,
was to make the best decision.

01:25:23.167 --> 01:25:24.807
However, you failed to do it.

01:25:25.207 --> 01:25:26.847
I know, Your Highness.

01:25:27.207 --> 01:25:31.967
However, the gravity of the situation
compelled me to do what I did.

01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:35.487
Nobody would have expected

01:25:35.647 --> 01:25:38.407
something like this to happen
at Ertuğrul Bey's inn.

01:25:40.527 --> 01:25:42.967
We are at war, Emir Sadettin.

01:25:43.287 --> 01:25:47.967
Everywhere is a battlefield
when we are at war.

01:25:48.647 --> 01:25:50.447
You know that better than me.

01:25:51.847 --> 01:25:57.647
We must be prepared for and expect
all kinds of schemes.

01:25:58.447 --> 01:26:02.767
After all, what our enemies like the best

01:26:03.167 --> 01:26:05.287
is to set brothers against each other.

01:26:10.967 --> 01:26:15.447
And if God had not protected us,
their schemes would have worked out.

01:26:17.487 --> 01:26:21.207
And you, Sadettin,
would have been tricked...

01:26:21.847 --> 01:26:24.207
and caused a huge disaster.

01:26:30.007 --> 01:26:30.967
Your Highness,

01:26:31.927 --> 01:26:36.967
what happened here taught me
and the others a great many things.

01:26:37.527 --> 01:26:40.367
In the future, we will be mindful

01:26:40.687 --> 01:26:43.887
and we won't succumb to such tricks.

01:26:44.207 --> 01:26:46.247
There is no future for you, Sadettin.

01:26:47.407 --> 01:26:49.807
There is no future for you.

01:26:51.927 --> 01:26:55.807
Such a huge mistake
will cost you your life.

01:27:09.567 --> 01:27:13.487
My life is yours to take, Your Highness.

01:27:28.967 --> 01:27:30.567
Oh, Vasilius.

01:27:32.287 --> 01:27:34.967
I should have prevented you
from going after Ertuğrul.

01:27:36.007 --> 01:27:38.687
I should have died instead of you.

01:27:40.207 --> 01:27:42.767
Nicaea will remember you,
brave commander, forever.

01:27:43.727 --> 01:27:45.567
We won't forget what you have done for us.

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:48.087
Commander, stop whining.

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:50.367
What do you think you are doing?

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:53.567
He was my friend.

01:27:54.647 --> 01:27:56.367
How could you be so apathetic?

01:27:58.167 --> 01:28:00.847
I lost my feelings when I lost my child.

01:28:02.007 --> 01:28:04.847
No death can hurt me now.

01:28:05.487 --> 01:28:06.607
And you...

01:28:06.927 --> 01:28:09.087
As you keep whining,

01:28:09.687 --> 01:28:11.567
we will lose everything we have.

01:28:11.687 --> 01:28:14.447
-We won't lose anything.
-Gather your commanders.

01:28:14.967 --> 01:28:17.847
We must take measure and plan
our next move at once.

01:28:17.927 --> 01:28:19.847
We will decide what to do next.

01:28:20.487 --> 01:28:21.807
You have no power here.

01:28:21.967 --> 01:28:24.927
And this comes from a man
that can't even manage his emotions?

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.647
This was my father's fortress.

01:28:28.967 --> 01:28:31.487
I'll answer to no one protecting it.

01:28:32.207 --> 01:28:35.047
Now, heed my words and work with me.

01:28:35.807 --> 01:28:38.247
Do you think commanders
would listen to a woman?

01:28:39.207 --> 01:28:41.327
A woman can change everything, Nikolas.

01:28:41.887 --> 01:28:43.287
Do as I say.

01:28:43.487 --> 01:28:45.047
I don't want any soldiers sleeping.

01:28:45.527 --> 01:28:47.767
They will all keep watch on the walls.

01:28:48.287 --> 01:28:50.847
It's only a matter of time
until Ertuğrul comes knocking.

01:28:51.127 --> 01:28:53.567
Gather your commanders and take measure.

01:28:54.127 --> 01:28:56.527
We will make them regret
ever thinking about it.

01:29:07.727 --> 01:29:09.287
One more step, Father.

01:29:10.767 --> 01:29:12.687
Just one more step...

01:29:14.607 --> 01:29:16.167
and I will have your legacy.

01:29:34.247 --> 01:29:36.687
<i>-As salaam alaikum.</i>
<i>-Wa alaikum as salaam.</i>

01:29:55.567 --> 01:30:00.327
In the name of God, most gracious,
most compassionate.

01:30:03.487 --> 01:30:05.207
Glory can't be beat with a mace.

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:09.047
Friends don't take offense with a word.

01:30:09.887 --> 01:30:12.967
Crooked are words if they contain lies.

01:30:13.527 --> 01:30:17.207
Brave is the one that speaks the truth
and straightens those words.

01:30:17.647 --> 01:30:21.167
And the meeting of beys by tradition
is where the truth is spoken.

01:30:21.847 --> 01:30:22.967
Blessed be our meeting.

01:30:23.127 --> 01:30:25.047
Amen.

01:30:30.807 --> 01:30:34.047
Now that our brave Turkmen beys
know the state of things,

01:30:34.687 --> 01:30:38.207
they deserve to know what happens next.

01:30:41.887 --> 01:30:46.327
What I'm about to tell you
is stating the obvious.

01:30:48.767 --> 01:30:53.087
I entrusted these lands to
my margrave Ertuğrul Bey...

01:30:55.887 --> 01:30:57.127
and to you.

01:31:01.967 --> 01:31:03.407
May your new home be abundant.

01:31:03.567 --> 01:31:06.567
-Amen.
-Good luck.

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:08.487
May God spare us any shame.

01:31:10.367 --> 01:31:12.047
You are right, Your Highness.

01:31:12.487 --> 01:31:16.607
As things stand,
the war with the heathens...

01:31:17.167 --> 01:31:20.047
will not end, despite all the dead.

01:31:23.087 --> 01:31:25.287
It's time to breach their walls.

01:31:27.687 --> 01:31:30.287
Karacahisar, the nest of all evil,
will be sieged...

01:31:31.127 --> 01:31:32.847
and will collapse around their heads.

01:31:37.327 --> 01:31:39.807
Until the last drop of our blood,
Your Highness.

01:31:40.007 --> 01:31:41.527
We are at your service, Your Highness.

01:31:43.967 --> 01:31:48.127
The lion's share of this great victory
belongs to Ertuğrul Bey.

01:31:49.807 --> 01:31:51.687
Ertuğrul Bey's ability

01:31:51.887 --> 01:31:54.447
has been proven every time
we have gotten into trouble.

01:31:58.447 --> 01:32:01.447
Your Highness speaks the truth.

01:32:07.207 --> 01:32:09.087
I succumbed to anger...

01:32:09.687 --> 01:32:12.047
due to the most sordid incidents...

01:32:13.047 --> 01:32:14.127
that took place earlier.

01:32:21.527 --> 01:32:23.007
I offended Ertuğrul Bey...

01:32:25.247 --> 01:32:28.087
and all the other beys present here.

01:32:34.087 --> 01:32:35.767
I beg all of you for forgiveness.

01:32:45.247 --> 01:32:47.047
It will not be repeated.

01:32:47.847 --> 01:32:52.327
The basis of justice will not be
tarnished with baseless claims,

01:32:53.087 --> 01:32:54.367
and no emir...

01:32:56.407 --> 01:32:57.967
or even a sultan,

01:32:58.207 --> 01:33:01.807
may pull our country down
with a summary execution.

01:33:05.807 --> 01:33:08.687
I'll serve to the best of my abilities
in the position

01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:12.287
that our sultan sees fit for me.

01:33:13.207 --> 01:33:17.087
We have been studying
Karacahisar Fortress for a while now.

01:33:18.087 --> 01:33:22.087
We know well its strengths and weaknesses.

01:33:23.407 --> 01:33:26.647
Now, on the orders of our sultan,

01:33:27.567 --> 01:33:31.967
and with the help of his armies,
conquest has become possible.

01:33:33.447 --> 01:33:36.047
Now, what befalls us

01:33:36.527 --> 01:33:40.207
is to raise our glorious flag
on the walls of that fortress.

01:33:41.487 --> 01:33:45.527
After the conquest,
I'll grant Ertuğrul Bey the control...

01:33:46.247 --> 01:33:47.807
{\an8}of these lands, and the fortress.

01:33:54.599 --> 01:33:57.719
My armies will aid you in the conquest.

01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:01.079
So long as you stay united,

01:34:01.799 --> 01:34:05.439
we'd know no defeat in both worlds.

01:34:05.799 --> 01:34:07.719
As you wish, Your Highness.

01:34:07.839 --> 01:34:09.919
We've been looking forward to it.

01:34:10.359 --> 01:34:13.479
Thank God we will get to taste victory
under your command.

01:34:23.279 --> 01:34:24.679
The meeting is over.

01:34:26.359 --> 01:34:30.279
Now, dull your tongues
and sharpen your swords.

01:34:30.399 --> 01:34:33.679
Long live the Sultan!
Long live our country!

01:34:33.799 --> 01:34:36.759
Long live the Sultan!
Long live our country!

01:34:36.999 --> 01:34:40.119
Long live the Sultan!
Long live our country!

01:34:40.239 --> 01:34:43.199
Long live the Sultan!
Long live our country!

01:34:43.319 --> 01:34:46.399
Long live the Sultan!
Long live our country!

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:49.799
Long live the Sultan!
Long live our country!

01:34:50.039 --> 01:34:53.199
Long live the Sultan!
Long live our country!

01:34:57.759 --> 01:34:58.919
"To the all powerful

01:35:00.599 --> 01:35:02.039
and all glorious emperor.

01:35:03.759 --> 01:35:07.279
I carry the baby of great
Commander Vasilius in my womb.

01:35:09.239 --> 01:35:12.719
In the defense of our lands
against the Turks,

01:35:13.079 --> 01:35:15.999
I'd like to fight to
the last drop of my blood.

01:35:17.439 --> 01:35:20.439
I'm ready to lay my life down to avenge

01:35:21.279 --> 01:35:23.479
the death of his father.

01:35:28.919 --> 01:35:32.999
I seek refuge in your mercy and might.

01:35:35.519 --> 01:35:40.559
I wish to take back the rights left by
my late father, that are rightfully mine.

01:35:41.919 --> 01:35:44.679
Before I seclude myself to the church
as a nun,

01:35:45.399 --> 01:35:47.679
I ask for your permission

01:35:47.799 --> 01:35:50.759
to defend this fortress
that my father built himself.

01:35:53.239 --> 01:35:55.639
Ekaterina, your most faithful servant

01:35:56.519 --> 01:35:58.959
that wants to serve you honorably,

01:35:59.279 --> 01:36:02.319
instead of living like a parasite."

01:36:17.959 --> 01:36:21.199
Our baby will get back at whoever
did this to us, Ural.

01:36:22.319 --> 01:36:24.759
I'll raise our child to be worthy of you.

01:36:26.719 --> 01:36:27.959
May you rest in peace.

01:37:24.119 --> 01:37:26.679
We have come to take Governor
Vasilius' body, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:37:27.239 --> 01:37:30.039
You have a right to
bury your governor properly.

01:37:37.279 --> 01:37:38.479
A bey is one who

01:37:38.999 --> 01:37:42.159
even the enemy respects.

01:37:42.879 --> 01:37:47.439
How lucky you are
that God gifted you with such virtues.

01:37:52.919 --> 01:37:57.359
I hope the people of Karacahisar
make the right decision

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:00.559
and prevent any more bloodshed.

01:38:02.719 --> 01:38:04.639
That's all I could ever wish for,
Your Highness.

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:05.879
Surely, they will.

01:38:06.199 --> 01:38:08.119
And it will be Artuk Bey
that will act as

01:38:08.679 --> 01:38:09.919
an important messenger.

01:38:10.959 --> 01:38:13.239
I'll wait for your good news,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:38:13.759 --> 01:38:15.879
I'll come to you as soon as I can,
Your Highness.

01:38:16.959 --> 01:38:18.119
If you will excuse me now.

01:39:35.079 --> 01:39:36.799
Loyal commanders of Nicaea.

01:39:37.959 --> 01:39:39.679
Veteran warriors of our fortress.

01:39:40.239 --> 01:39:44.559
We are deeply grieved with the loss
of our governor.

01:39:47.599 --> 01:39:49.079
However, we still have a mission.

01:39:51.119 --> 01:39:52.999
I gathered you here today to talk about

01:39:53.319 --> 01:39:55.359
the measures we need to take
to defend our fortress.

01:39:55.759 --> 01:39:59.159
Are we going to do it
in front of a woman, Commander Nikolas?

01:39:59.399 --> 01:40:03.239
This woman is the daughter of
the strongest governor of this fortress.

01:40:04.279 --> 01:40:07.279
She has a right to speak
just as much as you.

01:40:07.999 --> 01:40:10.599
That's disrespectful! Unheard of!

01:40:11.999 --> 01:40:13.679
It's against our rules.

01:40:15.879 --> 01:40:17.519
Commanders, please listen.

01:40:18.119 --> 01:40:21.359
Ekaterina knows the Turks best among us.

01:40:22.319 --> 01:40:23.439
I'll vouch for her.

01:40:24.039 --> 01:40:26.879
Plus, as things stand,

01:40:27.519 --> 01:40:29.159
our rules may change.

01:40:29.679 --> 01:40:30.719
We are at war.

01:40:31.319 --> 01:40:34.559
Our governor has been killed
and you're still going on about rules.

01:40:39.159 --> 01:40:41.839
I'd like to ask you great commanders.

01:40:42.959 --> 01:40:45.119
Do you have any idea what
we should do next?

01:40:46.119 --> 01:40:48.079
Of course, we will protect our fortress.

01:40:48.919 --> 01:40:49.839
And how?

01:40:50.519 --> 01:40:52.719
We have walls and soldiers.

01:40:53.799 --> 01:40:55.799
Our fortress was breached many times.

01:40:57.039 --> 01:40:58.879
Hundreds of our soldiers were killed.

01:40:59.199 --> 01:41:00.999
We will ask for reinforcements
from the emperor.

01:41:01.679 --> 01:41:04.599
We will get more soldiers,
and take more measures.

01:41:05.199 --> 01:41:07.159
That means we will
just lose more soldiers.

01:41:08.959 --> 01:41:12.079
And the emperor will hold you responsible
for each soldier that's killed.

01:41:15.439 --> 01:41:18.439
Plus, the measures you take
will prove to be utterly useless.

01:41:18.839 --> 01:41:20.599
And finally, we will lose our fortress

01:41:20.879 --> 01:41:23.679
and get trampled upon by the boots
of those Turks.

01:41:24.239 --> 01:41:25.759
What do you suggest, Ekaterina?

01:41:29.519 --> 01:41:32.679
We need an ally that can take them down
from inside.

01:41:33.559 --> 01:41:35.439
We will hit them where it hurts the most.

01:41:38.879 --> 01:41:42.359
They will start killing each other
before they can even reach the fortress.

01:41:43.199 --> 01:41:46.359
After all, if they manage to come here,

01:41:46.719 --> 01:41:49.639
nothing can stop them, not our soldiers,
and certainly not the walls.

01:41:52.839 --> 01:41:55.199
We will start a war between them.

01:41:55.959 --> 01:41:57.239
We won't lose a single man.

01:42:05.759 --> 01:42:09.759
We brought Governor Vasilius' body,
Commander Nikolas.

01:42:10.759 --> 01:42:13.159
Then let us hold a burial ceremony.

01:42:13.879 --> 01:42:16.799
Governor Vasilius has sacrificed
his life for our sake.

01:42:17.879 --> 01:42:19.959
We shall give him a proper send off.

01:42:37.959 --> 01:42:39.879
Get in, Gündüz.

01:42:43.879 --> 01:42:44.879
Mother.

01:42:45.719 --> 01:42:47.359
Welcome.

01:42:48.199 --> 01:42:49.559
Thank you, dear.

01:42:50.399 --> 01:42:51.679
Thank God.

01:42:54.239 --> 01:42:56.279
-My son.
-Grandma!

01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:01.239
Your grandma loves you so much.

01:43:03.239 --> 01:43:05.159
God bless your victory, dear.

01:43:05.479 --> 01:43:06.599
Halime, my love.

01:43:20.359 --> 01:43:22.439
Your prayers helped us win.

01:43:23.279 --> 01:43:24.759
God bless you, Halime.

01:43:27.159 --> 01:43:29.479
God bless your victory, dear.

01:43:33.079 --> 01:43:34.239
Come here.

01:43:37.359 --> 01:43:38.719
Big boy.

01:43:39.519 --> 01:43:42.119
Once you grow up to be a brave alp,

01:43:42.319 --> 01:43:44.439
we will fight wars along
with your brother Savcı.

01:43:46.079 --> 01:43:47.279
May God permit.

01:43:53.959 --> 01:43:55.679
How is the situation here, Artuk Bey?

01:43:55.839 --> 01:44:00.559
Nothing is out of the ordinary,
it's just as you left it, sir.

01:44:01.559 --> 01:44:03.119
We were concerned only about you.

01:44:03.759 --> 01:44:08.239
Thank God you came back safely
and victorious, to top it off.

01:44:08.599 --> 01:44:11.159
All our concerns and worries
have disappeared.

01:44:12.159 --> 01:44:13.439
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

01:44:15.039 --> 01:44:18.559
Our Sultan saw you fit to go to
Karacahisar as a messenger.

01:44:19.719 --> 01:44:21.679
God bless our Sultan, sir.

01:44:21.839 --> 01:44:23.559
I'm honored to take his order.

01:44:24.759 --> 01:44:27.879
Once you reach the fortress,
tell the commander that

01:44:28.719 --> 01:44:33.399
they should surrender before our
Mighty Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad arrives.

01:44:34.239 --> 01:44:38.399
Otherwise, I shall leave no one alive,

01:44:38.559 --> 01:44:40.599
and destroy that fortress.

01:44:41.559 --> 01:44:45.119
Leave it to me, sir.
I'll get going right away.

01:44:52.479 --> 01:44:53.479
Bey.

01:44:54.239 --> 01:44:57.239
I have good news for you.

01:44:57.919 --> 01:44:59.319
What is it, Halime?

01:44:59.999 --> 01:45:02.719
You have a healthy nephew.

01:45:05.079 --> 01:45:06.319
Banu Çiçek...

01:45:10.319 --> 01:45:12.279
Thank God.

01:45:12.479 --> 01:45:14.639
How is she, dear?

01:45:14.759 --> 01:45:16.479
She is great, Mother.

01:45:16.679 --> 01:45:20.239
She gave birth to a healthy son
without a sweat.

01:45:20.439 --> 01:45:21.999
God bless.

01:45:25.759 --> 01:45:28.359
God bless, I'm happy for her.

01:45:28.759 --> 01:45:30.079
Amen.

01:45:32.439 --> 01:45:33.799
Banu Çiçek.

01:45:34.679 --> 01:45:36.479
My forlorn girl.

01:45:50.759 --> 01:45:54.279
May God help us protect
this peace forever, Dündar.

01:45:56.359 --> 01:45:57.679
Amen, brother.

01:46:22.159 --> 01:46:26.319
God bless both Artuk Bey and Ishak.

01:46:28.679 --> 01:46:31.959
Thank God they treated your wounds.

01:46:32.519 --> 01:46:33.679
That's right.

01:46:33.879 --> 01:46:35.919
I lost count of how many wounds

01:46:36.559 --> 01:46:38.479
Artuk Bey and Ishak treated.

01:46:39.999 --> 01:46:43.439
I'd always put ointment
on my wounds by myself.

01:46:43.679 --> 01:46:45.919
Or it was my brothers.

01:46:46.919 --> 01:46:48.719
And now, it is you.

01:46:49.039 --> 01:46:51.359
With the touch of your hands,

01:46:51.799 --> 01:46:55.639
I'm sure my wounds will close up sooner
and I'll feel no pain anymore.

01:46:56.479 --> 01:46:59.079
Rather than being the cure of your wounds,

01:46:59.919 --> 01:47:03.039
I'm more worried about seeing
you wounded like this again, Bamsi.

01:47:03.879 --> 01:47:06.199
It's over now.

01:47:06.319 --> 01:47:08.159
The head of the snake is crushed.

01:47:08.279 --> 01:47:11.479
-No need to worry.
-Thank God.

01:47:13.319 --> 01:47:15.479
Now, my father can rest in peace as well.

01:47:17.519 --> 01:47:19.959
It's one bit of good news after another.

01:47:20.079 --> 01:47:24.039
Oh, I hope it's good.
Tell me what is it, love.

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:27.359
-Bamsi.
-Yes?

01:47:28.119 --> 01:47:29.759
Congratulations.

01:47:29.839 --> 01:47:31.319
Hafsa Hatun, don't say that

01:47:32.239 --> 01:47:33.599
I'll be a father.

01:47:35.359 --> 01:47:37.639
Not a father, but an uncle, Bamsi.

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:40.119
Meaning?

01:47:41.479 --> 01:47:44.919
Oh, my God! Did Çiçek Hatun give birth?

01:47:45.799 --> 01:47:50.159
Oh, my God! I'm an uncle!

01:47:50.239 --> 01:47:52.199
I'm an uncle!

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:54.759
How is he, Hafsa?

01:47:54.879 --> 01:47:57.399
What does it look like?
How much does it weigh?

01:47:57.639 --> 01:47:59.999
Hafsa Hatun, is it a he or she?

01:48:00.079 --> 01:48:01.319
It's a he, Bamsi.

01:48:01.439 --> 01:48:04.439
Oh, my God! One more alp for us!

01:48:04.559 --> 01:48:07.119
God bless!

01:48:07.279 --> 01:48:10.679
Hafsa Hatun, let me pass this
on to my brothers.

01:48:10.759 --> 01:48:13.239
Let me tell them about it.
I can't wait.

01:48:13.319 --> 01:48:15.679
I can't wait, I'm going.
Here I go.

01:48:15.799 --> 01:48:18.479
Bamsi! Change your clothes before you go!

01:48:35.239 --> 01:48:38.079
-May I enter?
-Come in, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:48:43.879 --> 01:48:44.879
Sit.

01:48:54.679 --> 01:48:56.839
It's so nice to see you in such bliss.

01:48:57.719 --> 01:48:59.999
-May God make it everlasting.
-Amen.

01:49:03.359 --> 01:49:06.679
Thanks to your prayers and favor,
we defeated that troublesome Vasilius.

01:49:07.479 --> 01:49:09.199
Now, all I hope for

01:49:09.639 --> 01:49:12.799
is to raise our flag
on Karacahisar Fortress.

01:49:14.159 --> 01:49:17.199
Strive for it, and God shall help,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:49:18.599 --> 01:49:20.399
May God help you work harder.

01:49:23.279 --> 01:49:26.959
If you make every effort for it,
God will fill in if you need anything.

01:49:27.599 --> 01:49:28.599
Thank you.

01:49:29.679 --> 01:49:33.319
You fight against the cruel

01:49:33.599 --> 01:49:36.519
to spread God's words

01:49:37.079 --> 01:49:40.399
and for the victory of Islam.

01:49:41.679 --> 01:49:44.119
As our holy religion dictates,

01:49:44.759 --> 01:49:47.959
we shall strive to save the oppressed
from the hands of the cruel.

01:49:51.199 --> 01:49:53.999
You aim to establish justice
in the whole world.

01:49:55.239 --> 01:49:58.439
Our prophet Muhammad

01:49:59.039 --> 01:50:01.079
says this in one of his sayings.

01:50:01.359 --> 01:50:03.079
If winning prizes,

01:50:03.799 --> 01:50:05.759
gaining fame and glory

01:50:06.839 --> 01:50:10.439
and gaining authority
are the reasons for this war,

01:50:10.999 --> 01:50:14.279
then it's no war. The real war

01:50:14.879 --> 01:50:17.959
strives to bring glory to God's name.

01:50:19.719 --> 01:50:22.759
How lucky you are to be
fighting for this holy cause.

01:50:26.039 --> 01:50:32.199
Our prophet and other Muslims
fought in the Badr, against the cruel

01:50:33.039 --> 01:50:34.839
who severely outnumbered them.

01:50:35.559 --> 01:50:36.879
And he emerged victorious.

01:50:38.239 --> 01:50:41.239
After Badr came the Battle of Uhud.

01:50:42.279 --> 01:50:44.199
And the Battle of the Trench ensued.

01:50:45.239 --> 01:50:47.959
There was no end to the many wars
and the amount of dead.

01:50:50.759 --> 01:50:52.999
We must be prepared for Uhud-like wars.

01:50:53.879 --> 01:50:55.959
We must be prepared for more Trenches.

01:50:57.279 --> 01:51:00.279
That's why we must not
let ourselves relax just yet.

01:51:00.999 --> 01:51:04.479
Once the prophet got back from a battle,

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:07.759
he said this to his followers:

01:51:08.479 --> 01:51:11.159
"This turned into a great jihad,
which was only a small one."

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:13.919
His believers were dumbfounded.

01:51:14.759 --> 01:51:16.199
They asked the prophet

01:51:17.079 --> 01:51:19.999
if there were greater wars.

01:51:21.439 --> 01:51:23.319
He said this unto them:

01:51:24.519 --> 01:51:27.439
"The real great war is against greed."

01:51:28.279 --> 01:51:32.479
Ertuğrul Bey, you are only victorious
if you can grasp the hearts.

01:51:35.239 --> 01:51:39.279
You must be free from arrogance,
disdain, and ambition.

01:51:42.359 --> 01:51:44.239
We need you.

01:51:44.999 --> 01:51:47.479
Your existence gives us strength.

01:51:47.599 --> 01:51:49.679
May God bless you.

01:51:53.599 --> 01:51:55.879
There are two kinds of soldiers,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:51:57.439 --> 01:51:59.159
One strives for victory,

01:52:00.519 --> 01:52:02.479
while the other for prayers.

01:52:03.599 --> 01:52:06.119
One fights with his swords,

01:52:06.479 --> 01:52:09.119
while the other embraces
a shield of prayer.

01:52:10.239 --> 01:52:14.679
Victory comes to those armies
who have equal amounts of those.

01:52:16.599 --> 01:52:20.679
We will always be with you
with our armies of prayer.

01:52:22.199 --> 01:52:23.199
Thank you.

01:52:36.159 --> 01:52:41.079
Brother, put this ointment on
in the mornings, not now.

01:52:42.479 --> 01:52:45.919
You also lost a lot of blood.
Drink <i>pekmez</i> often.

01:52:48.239 --> 01:52:50.839
Thank you. God bless you, Ishak.

01:52:50.999 --> 01:52:51.999
Thank you, brother.

01:52:52.079 --> 01:52:54.319
Don't worry, Ishak.

01:52:54.439 --> 01:52:57.079
Neither Bamsi, nor Abdur Rahman
would ever run out of blood.

01:52:57.479 --> 01:52:58.599
And why is that?

01:52:59.119 --> 01:53:01.919
Because both dropped in <i>pekmez</i> cauldrons
when they were young.

01:53:12.559 --> 01:53:14.639
Brothers!

01:53:15.479 --> 01:53:18.559
Oh, my God! Congratulations!

01:53:18.679 --> 01:53:19.759
What's all this about, Bamsi?

01:53:19.959 --> 01:53:22.639
Brother, we became uncles.

01:53:22.759 --> 01:53:24.399
Turgut, we became uncles!

01:53:24.559 --> 01:53:26.199
What do you mean, brother?

01:53:27.159 --> 01:53:28.279
What do you mean uncle?

01:53:29.319 --> 01:53:30.559
Do you mean, Banu Çiçek...

01:53:30.639 --> 01:53:34.239
Exactly, brother. Banu Çiçek
gave birth to a healthy young man.

01:53:34.359 --> 01:53:36.279
Our brother Doğan has a son.

01:53:40.239 --> 01:53:41.599
God bless!

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:48.679
Thank God, brothers,

01:53:48.759 --> 01:53:50.319
for showing us such a day.

01:53:50.439 --> 01:53:52.199
You are right, brother.

01:53:52.399 --> 01:53:55.439
First, we took the head of
the dog Vasilius, and now this.

01:53:55.639 --> 01:53:56.999
Thank God.

01:53:57.719 --> 01:54:00.079
How is he, Bamsi?

01:54:00.199 --> 01:54:03.199
He's well. He is quite something.

01:54:03.919 --> 01:54:07.439
I didn't see him myself
but that's what Hafsa Hatun said.

01:54:07.599 --> 01:54:10.799
God bless, what is she going to name him?

01:54:14.159 --> 01:54:15.919
That's our decision to make.

01:54:16.319 --> 01:54:18.239
Ertuğrul Bey shall name him.

01:54:19.039 --> 01:54:21.639
Thank God that he was born healthy.

01:54:21.839 --> 01:54:22.799
Thank God.

01:54:24.439 --> 01:54:25.719
Now, Bamsi.

01:54:26.759 --> 01:54:28.599
It's your turn next, brother.

01:54:29.959 --> 01:54:32.559
Amen, brother.

01:54:32.879 --> 01:54:36.719
However, you should think about it, too.

01:54:36.879 --> 01:54:40.079
It's your turn next as well.

01:54:45.879 --> 01:54:47.879
Bamsi, never mind that.

01:54:48.919 --> 01:54:51.239
What's this get up, brother?

01:55:04.239 --> 01:55:08.319
I don't know,
I just ran out of the tent, brother.

01:55:08.439 --> 01:55:10.399
I ran off to tell you.

01:55:15.319 --> 01:55:17.559
Brother, if there was an ambush now,

01:55:17.719 --> 01:55:20.879
and the drums were beat,

01:55:21.039 --> 01:55:23.679
is this how you would face the enemy?

01:55:28.159 --> 01:55:29.559
There is no enemy

01:55:29.879 --> 01:55:32.319
better than you, brother. Come now!

01:55:32.439 --> 01:55:35.239
Come here!
You are the worst enemy!

01:55:35.519 --> 01:55:38.279
Come here!

01:57:08.559 --> 01:57:13.559
Men! Commander Vasilius
has left us an important legacy.

01:57:14.559 --> 01:57:15.759
Karacahisar Fortress.

01:57:15.959 --> 01:57:18.119
We won't surrender our forefathers' legacy

01:57:18.799 --> 01:57:21.559
until the last of our men dies.

01:57:28.839 --> 01:57:30.719
This is our home.

01:57:31.879 --> 01:57:33.799
They will want to take it from us.

01:57:35.679 --> 01:57:39.599
But we will protect this fortress as if
it was the last fortress of our empire.

01:57:41.399 --> 01:57:45.559
We won't let them go unpunished
for taking your friends.

01:57:45.879 --> 01:57:50.719
We are ready to die in the blink
of an eye like Commander Vasilius.

01:57:51.519 --> 01:57:53.319
Let us honor his legacy!

01:57:55.039 --> 01:57:56.439
Long live Nicaea!

01:57:56.559 --> 01:58:02.159
Long live Nicaea!

01:58:02.319 --> 01:58:07.639
Long live Nicaea!

01:58:07.799 --> 01:58:13.279
Long live Nicaea!

01:58:13.639 --> 01:58:18.799
Long live Nicaea!

01:58:18.999 --> 01:58:25.399
Long live Nicaea!

01:58:25.559 --> 01:58:30.599
Long live Nicaea!

01:58:30.839 --> 01:58:32.519
Long live Nicaea!

01:58:32.639 --> 01:58:36.519
<i>Everyone that I want dead</i>
<i>will die like this, one by one.</i>

01:58:36.959 --> 01:58:40.919
<i>And Ertuğrul, your turn</i>
<i>will definitely come as well.</i>

01:59:50.039 --> 01:59:51.039
Brother.

01:59:53.359 --> 01:59:54.759
My brave brother.

01:59:58.399 --> 02:00:00.839
The bravest of them all, Aliyar.

02:00:02.919 --> 02:00:04.399
My martyr brother.

02:00:08.399 --> 02:00:11.079
May you rest in peace.

02:00:13.039 --> 02:00:16.159
May you go to heaven.

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:21.999
Rest assured now.

02:00:24.119 --> 02:00:26.159
You have been avenged.

02:00:27.999 --> 02:00:29.839
We took your revenge.

02:00:37.279 --> 02:00:38.999
I will walk on your path.

02:00:39.919 --> 02:00:41.999
And die for your cause.

02:00:43.519 --> 02:00:45.639
Your tribe is safe with me.

02:00:46.559 --> 02:00:51.039
Your sister will carry on
with your cause from now on.

02:01:38.479 --> 02:01:39.959
What happened, Bamsi?

02:01:40.279 --> 02:01:42.359
It's been a while since
you were like this.

02:01:44.519 --> 02:01:48.399
Sir, if you encourage him like this,
he will lose his self-control.

02:01:50.119 --> 02:01:55.679
I still remember
the very first day we came here, sir.

02:01:56.599 --> 02:01:58.279
Look at where we are now.

02:01:58.599 --> 02:02:02.799
That's why my mind is racing, sir.

02:02:02.959 --> 02:02:04.239
I can't stand still.

02:02:05.159 --> 02:02:07.319
Remember the plane tree, sir?

02:02:07.559 --> 02:02:11.479
I remember the day we planted it,
crystal clear.

02:02:16.879 --> 02:02:18.159
Come on, brothers.

02:02:41.879 --> 02:02:46.999
God, let the branches of this plane tree
embrace the whole world.

02:02:48.319 --> 02:02:49.839
May it take root here.

02:02:50.639 --> 02:02:54.159
So that our people may spread

02:02:54.559 --> 02:02:57.119
your justice and compassion
to the entire world.

02:02:58.919 --> 02:03:03.599
This shall be our mission, too,
as it is for this plane tree.

02:03:04.599 --> 02:03:05.599
Amen.

02:03:24.999 --> 02:03:27.959
The sun will be our flag,
and the skies our tent.

02:03:28.719 --> 02:03:31.359
We will ride our horses
to the endless meadows.

02:03:32.679 --> 02:03:36.359
Our swords will be our lovers,
and we will make our armies strong.

02:03:37.479 --> 02:03:41.639
Our seal shall ripple for all eternity
as the signal of justice.

02:03:43.559 --> 02:03:47.999
We will carry God's holy word
beyond the mountains and seas.

02:03:49.879 --> 02:03:52.079
<i>-Allahu akbar!</i>
-<i>Allah!</i>

02:03:53.999 --> 02:03:55.879
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

02:03:56.159 --> 02:04:00.039
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

02:04:02.679 --> 02:04:05.639
Our tree has spread its root
to the earth, brother.

02:04:06.039 --> 02:04:07.959
Yes, indeed, brother.

02:04:08.119 --> 02:04:11.559
So much so, that nobody can tear it down.

02:04:12.639 --> 02:04:15.719
Vasilius got what he deserved.

02:04:15.959 --> 02:04:19.879
Sir, celebrate this day.

02:04:20.439 --> 02:04:22.559
Let's make it a double celebration.

02:04:22.879 --> 02:04:27.399
Now that I've become an uncle,
nobody can stop me.

02:04:28.079 --> 02:04:30.079
I'll eat honey for 40 days straight.

02:04:30.199 --> 02:04:34.039
I will eat tons of pastrami
and fried meat, sir.

02:04:38.799 --> 02:04:39.799
Dad!

02:04:40.079 --> 02:04:42.759
My big boy. God bless. Come here.

02:04:46.319 --> 02:04:49.759
Another alp has been born.
Now, I have not one, but two alps.

02:04:49.879 --> 02:04:51.919
Wonderful, great commander Gündüz.

02:04:52.479 --> 02:04:55.119
Gündüz, come now.
Let's watch over your men.

02:04:55.199 --> 02:04:56.159
Come.

02:04:57.999 --> 02:05:03.039
Ertuğrul Bey, Banu Çiçek brought
her baby for you to name him.

02:05:03.359 --> 02:05:04.599
Congratulations, sister.

02:05:07.759 --> 02:05:09.079
Thank you, sir.

02:05:14.799 --> 02:05:17.199
Shed no more tears, sister.

02:05:18.279 --> 02:05:21.359
We took Doğan's revenge.

02:05:22.119 --> 02:05:23.159
He's been avenged.

02:05:25.159 --> 02:05:27.599
God bless you, sir.

02:05:28.199 --> 02:05:30.039
-Amen.
-Thank you.

02:05:31.319 --> 02:05:33.439
May he rest in peace.

02:05:33.879 --> 02:05:36.119
May Aliyar rest in peace, too.

02:05:37.559 --> 02:05:41.839
Our enemies at Karacahisar Fortress
will live in unrest now.

02:05:42.759 --> 02:05:44.559
We will conquer it soon, sister.

02:05:49.759 --> 02:05:52.799
Sir, if you'd be so kind as to accept,

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:56.799
I'd like you to name Doğan's legacy.

02:06:02.039 --> 02:06:03.999
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

02:06:09.399 --> 02:06:16.239
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

02:06:17.439 --> 02:06:22.599
<i>Ashadu an la ilaha illa'llah.</i>

02:06:23.519 --> 02:06:29.439
<i>Wa Ashad anna Muhammadan Rasululu'llah</i>

02:06:29.759 --> 02:06:32.959
<i>Hayya alas Salah</i>

02:06:33.159 --> 02:06:36.439
<i>Hayya alal Falah</i>

02:06:37.399 --> 02:06:40.439
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

02:06:40.679 --> 02:06:42.439
<i>La ilaha illallah</i>

02:06:44.159 --> 02:06:45.359
Your name is...

02:06:46.079 --> 02:06:47.199
Doğan.

02:06:47.879 --> 02:06:50.199
Your name is Doğan.

02:06:50.599 --> 02:06:53.119
Your name is Doğan.

02:06:55.999 --> 02:06:58.919
You took your name
from your martyr father.

02:07:00.479 --> 02:07:01.959
May God give you a long life.

02:07:02.639 --> 02:07:04.399
-Amen.
-Amen.

02:07:05.839 --> 02:07:09.519
A son of a Turk is born a wolf,
and his home is wherever he sets foot.

02:07:12.039 --> 02:07:15.719
Let the heavens and the earth know that

02:07:18.159 --> 02:07:20.759
his name is Doğan.

02:07:27.079 --> 02:07:28.399
May he be blessed.

02:07:33.919 --> 02:07:37.959
Ertuğrul Bey, you gave him
the name we all wished for.

02:07:38.599 --> 02:07:40.319
God bless you.

02:07:40.639 --> 02:07:42.159
Thank you.

02:07:46.159 --> 02:07:51.359
Grow up to be a brave and merciful alp,
like your father, your namesake.

02:07:54.079 --> 02:07:57.119
May he never stray from
Ertuğrul Bey's cause.

02:08:02.399 --> 02:08:03.799
Dündar Bey.

02:08:05.999 --> 02:08:07.919
Hold your nephew.

02:08:35.559 --> 02:08:36.959
Thanks to many martyrs,

02:08:38.119 --> 02:08:39.559
such as Doğan

02:08:40.519 --> 02:08:42.679
and Aliyar Bey,

02:08:43.559 --> 02:08:46.919
our children are born free,
and shall live free.
