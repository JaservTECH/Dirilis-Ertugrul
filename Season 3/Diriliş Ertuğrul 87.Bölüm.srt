1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 87 will start after 12:25 min.

2
00:13:30,178 --> 00:13:31,378
Aktolgali...

3
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:34,818
We've climbed all the mountains

4
00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:39,458
between the Caspian Sea
and the Byzantine border.

5
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:47,058
The ground was our bed, the sky our tent.

6
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:51,418
We gave hope to the poor
and struck fear in tyrants.

7
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:57,218
We did not torment,
nor did we surrender to oppressors.

8
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,618
As long as this soul resides in this body

9
00:14:02,378 --> 00:14:06,898
we'll pierce the houses
of the infidels like spears.

10
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:14,098
On this road we'll act like Abraham,

11
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:19,058
as determined as an ant,
we'll walk through fires if necessary.

12
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:25,938
However, never ever
will we give up our cause.

13
00:14:29,978 --> 00:14:33,098
Those who plotted our downfall
were themselves overthrown.

14
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:38,058
God didn't abandon
those who stood by him.

15
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:45,658
Victory will not carry us
to pride or riches.

16
00:14:46,738 --> 00:14:50,978
We'll conquer one heart
instead of a thousand castles.

17
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:56,018
We'll unify all of humanity.

18
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:00,338
Today I might only be telling you,

19
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:03,018
but tomorrow everyone will know it.

20
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:08,338
If we keep this goal alive and strong,

21
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:13,418
one day, this whole world
will be conquered by the Turks.

22
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:04,578
-Run!
-Sir!

23
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:07,258
We have to run. We're compromised.
They're after us.

24
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,658
Run! Get them!

25
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:29,458
Run! Get them!

26
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:56,098
-Welcome, my Bey.

27
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:59,858
Thank you, Aleko. Any news?

28
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:03,898
Not much since Vasilius
cut trade with the Greeks.

29
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:06,298
Muslim traders have also suffered.

30
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:12,978
Vasilius has ruined the long standing
trade balance with his ambition, my Bey.

31
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:17,738
Even his own folk
are set to rise up, Artuk Bey.

32
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:22,538
How long can Vasilius
keep this up, Ertuğrul Bey?

33
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:24,938
We can't let a log dam the river.

34
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:29,778
Trade will return to normal
eventually, Aliyar Bey.

35
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:35,138
The issue is what
the people will do until then.

36
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:41,378
Muslim folk are getting by, my Bey.
They can manage.

37
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:44,178
But the Greeks are suffering.

38
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:48,578
Did you do what I said?

39
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:51,818
We're helping the Greeks
as you ordered, my Bey.

40
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:54,978
But more is needed.

41
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:57,818
It's coming, Artuk Bey.

42
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:00,218
More will come.

43
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:06,938
Protect the stall holders.
If they go, we'll all suffer.

44
00:19:07,498 --> 00:19:10,538
Don't worry, my Bey.
Nobody's going anywhere.

45
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:13,538
They all respect you and are grateful.

46
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:16,298
They won't forget what you've done.

47
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:19,178
Thank you.

48
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:22,938
{\an8}Now, let's go.

49
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:25,618
{\an8}We'll discuss what to do.

50
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:39,309
I swear, before the holy soul of Jesus...

51
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:43,869
and our virgin mother Mary,

52
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:47,029
that as long as I live

53
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:51,389
Ertuğrul, Aliyar and Vasilius

54
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,269
will not sleep easy.

55
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:59,029
Just as they have taken my son
and my Ural from me,

56
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:02,749
so I will make them suffer
even greater pain.

57
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:09,149
Yes.

58
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:11,109
Çolpan.

59
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,549
Come.

60
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:34,669
You've been in here for weeks.
I was worried you were dead.

61
00:20:36,189 --> 00:20:41,389
I have no intention of dying
before I have taken my revenge, Governor.

62
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,429
I'll do what you could not.

63
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:49,309
And how will you do that?

64
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,029
Look at yourself.

65
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,509
You want revenge,
but you can't even leave your room.

66
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:02,629
Why didn't you protect my Ural
when it was in your power to do so?

67
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,029
You used him as bait for Ertuğrul.

68
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:09,189
He trusted you.

69
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:13,189
Don't blame me for what happened
to your husband, Çolpan!

70
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:15,629
He was the victim of his own folly.

71
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,509
And you? What will you do?

72
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,149
My, my, my.

73
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:44,829
Çolpan...

74
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:49,149
You managed to hide
your faith from everyone, huh?

75
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:52,229
I practiced it in secret.

76
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:56,269
I'll answer to no one but God.

77
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:01,909
Our faith is our strongest shield.

78
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,669
Our father in heaven is our savior.

79
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:07,909
His light will show us the way

80
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:11,789
while agony will surely find
its way to them some day.

81
00:22:19,469 --> 00:22:23,309
You're stronger than Ural. And smarter.

82
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:15,229
If we are to be truly strong,
being united isn't enough, Aliyar Bey.

83
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:18,109
Our people need us

84
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:23,109
to protect them from other
religions and nations.

85
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,269
Now that the dust has settled,

86
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:27,509
the situation
that the people find themselves in

87
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:30,669
has become much
more obvious, Ertuğrul Bey.

88
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:34,749
The tyranny of Vasilius on one side,
famine on the other.

89
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:37,229
All non-Muslims are suffering.

90
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:41,269
We didn't have any food
when we arrived here either, Artuk Bey.

91
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:47,909
We know their suffering.
We'll share what we have.

92
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,589
For a long time
all they've thought to want

93
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:55,469
is food and water,

94
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:59,589
when what they actually need is security,
mercy and prosperity, Ertuğrul Bey.

95
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:04,269
That's why we have a lot to do,
Aliyar Bey.

96
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:06,949
We'll create a new order.

97
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:12,469
We'll work harder, but cautiously,
without letting our victory blind us.

98
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:14,909
To truly triumph,

99
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:20,429
it isn't only territory we must conquer,
but the hearts of the people.

100
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:24,869
Our enemies will have many
sleepless nights ahead of them,

101
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:27,989
especially Vasilius, Ertuğrul Bey.

102
00:24:28,749 --> 00:24:31,109
That's exactly what we want, Aliyar Bey.

103
00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:36,509
The people are human beings
and deserve to be respected as such.

104
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:44,589
As God created the universe
and the people, we respect it all.

105
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:48,549
There's been no word of that dog
Vasilius for a long time, Ertuğrul.

106
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:51,069
We don't know where he is
or what he's planning.

107
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:56,669
Vasilius will want to avenge
the wound we inflicted on him.

108
00:24:57,549 --> 00:24:59,589
He'll be planning something big.

109
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:03,389
His defeats will also worry the emperor.

110
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:07,509
That's why they'll very likely
send reinforcements.

111
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:09,069
May I enter, my Bey?

112
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:11,029
Come in, Samsa.

113
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:20,589
Forgive me, my Bey,
but I have important news.

114
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:38,949
Governor Vasilius!

115
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:47,709
Nikolas.

116
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:50,669
Great Commander Vasilius,
we're at your command.

117
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:59,029
Protectors of our empire,

118
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:01,869
my fearless warriors,

119
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:03,909
welcome to your castle!

120
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,789
At your command, sir!

121
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:09,829
You've marched a great distance,
get some rest.

122
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,629
As you command, sir.

123
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,949
My loyal friend, Nikolas.

124
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:26,589
I've been waiting for this for so long.

125
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:29,589
Come, we have much to discuss. Come along.

126
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:34,189
Speak, Dumrul.

127
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,349
We were watching the castle as ordered.

128
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:39,589
A large unit has arrived from Nicaea.

129
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:42,029
More than before, my bey.

130
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,029
So that's the reason for
this silence, Ertuğrul Bey.

131
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:49,429
Vasilius is making preparations.

132
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:53,749
Vasilius' intention is clear.

133
00:26:54,669 --> 00:27:00,629
These soldiers haven't come to defend
the castle but to spill our blood.

134
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:03,589
They're about to take their last breath,

135
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:06,069
because we're going
to take out their lungs.

136
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:10,909
How did we not hear of such
an important development earlier, my Bey?

137
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:16,989
The Sultan's eye in Nicaea...

138
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:20,669
Something must have happened to him.

139
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:22,549
Either...

140
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,229
he was unable to leave the palace...

141
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:27,909
or he's been compromised, Ertuğrul Bey.

142
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:32,229
In either case, his life is in danger.

143
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,589
-I'm all right, keep going!
-Come on.

144
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:18,829
With no news from the palace,
we're effectively blind.

145
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:22,589
We have no one at the castle either.

146
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,989
Be our guest today, Aliyar Bey.

147
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:30,629
We can spend the evening together.

148
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:34,189
We can discuss what we should do.

149
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:36,829
God willing, I shall
be there, Ertuğrul Bey.

150
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:59,509
My armor is dusty
and my sword is rusty, Nikolas

151
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:03,469
That man in Nicaea...

152
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:06,989
That fool, that coward...

153
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:12,989
Most of the generals at the palace agree
with us, Vasilius. They're ready for war.

154
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:16,629
They've had enough
of this cowardly emperor.

155
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:19,429
You're a beacon of hope to them, Vasilius.

156
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:21,309
He's not my emperor.

157
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,949
All he deserves is a hole full of mud.

158
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:28,109
When I'm done with the Turks,
it'll be his turn.

159
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:29,909
His throne will be his grave.

160
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,269
Ertuğrul has slowed us down.

161
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:35,029
He's the great hope of the Turks now.

162
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:37,149
He's the head of the snake!

163
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:42,749
Before he came along it was
the Turks who were hiding, not us.

164
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:45,629
He gave them courage.

165
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:51,789
If he dies...
the Turks will lose all hope.

166
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:55,429
If only Ural had succeeded, we'd be
celebrating our victory right now.

167
00:30:56,109 --> 00:30:57,109
Yeah...

168
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:03,709
Ural doesn't really matter.
He did what I wanted him to do.

169
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:08,349
They fought amongst each other.
They've lost trust.

170
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:14,109
We made a breach
in the Turk's shield, Nikolas.

171
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:17,229
And now we widen this breach.

172
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:22,709
You've been quiet for a long time.
They'll think you've given up.

173
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,149
Let them, Nikolas.

174
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:28,909
Let them. That's what I want.

175
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:33,069
I've been making plans.
I'll attack when they least expect it.

176
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,189
Also...

177
00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:40,269
this old castle has been fortified.

178
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:43,269
I've repaired all the towers myself.

179
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:47,749
Sultan Alaeddin has set his eye
on Karacahisar, despite the Mongols.

180
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:50,589
Everyone knows that.

181
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:59,349
He's set his eye on his grave.
He just doesn't know it yet.

182
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:03,269
Even if he laid siege,
he'd have to fight for months.

183
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:08,749
Anyway, we'll beat them before they
even get a chance to approach the walls.

184
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:14,989
The time for defense is over.
Now we attack. To victory.

185
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:17,069
To our victory.

186
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:09,429
Don't hold the sword
too tightly or too loosely.

187
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,989
It must be an extension of your body.
Understand?

188
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:22,629
Strength and speed.

189
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:25,909
Without these...

190
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:28,949
no sword will obey you.

191
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,669
The sword wants a strong alp.

192
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:39,389
The sword wants a brave alp.

193
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:43,549
-Are you brave and strong?
-Yes, we are!

194
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,149
Show me then.

195
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:49,029
You.

196
00:34:01,949 --> 00:34:02,909
Attack.

197
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,549
Good. Like this.

198
00:34:32,189 --> 00:34:33,629
Attack again.

199
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:05,509
You're not even at half strength.

200
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:11,229
We have enemies on all sides.

201
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,549
First, know your enemy well.

202
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:24,069
Know who's strong, who's weak.

203
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:27,509
Go on, warriors.

204
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:31,789
-Now, work harder. Come on.
-As you command, Master Alp!

205
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:46,629
Come on. Keep going. Great.

206
00:36:41,989 --> 00:36:46,189
God protect you, Dündar Bey.
My children have gone to bed hungry.

207
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:48,349
Now they'll eat, thanks to you.

208
00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:51,549
Ertuğrul Bey is always with you,
remember that.

209
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:53,309
-God bless you.
-God bless you.

210
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,389
Banu Çiçek Hatun.

211
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:38,029
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.

212
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,509
Banu Çiçek Hatun...

213
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:43,909
Think of the baby inside you.

214
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:47,549
We don't want anything happening
to our nephew.

215
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:51,269
You never thought about
Doğan while he was alive.

216
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:54,869
Shame.

217
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:57,989
You'd been walking around like a bey.

218
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:02,829
Who knew you'd be a curse on the tribe?

219
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:09,429
Now, Dündar Bey... stay away from me.

220
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:03,229
Devoted women of the Kayi tribe...

221
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:06,549
and brave men.

222
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:12,109
We follow a prophet
who would not sleep with a full belly

223
00:39:12,869 --> 00:39:15,669
while his neighbor was hungry.

224
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,589
Our responsibility is a heavy one.

225
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:28,109
We must help all innocents
without seeing religion or nationality.

226
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:35,029
Our help will be the hope
of our non-Muslim neighbors.

227
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:37,989
They will not forget our sacrifice.

228
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:46,149
God willing,
these donations will strengthen our union.

229
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:48,389
God willing.

230
00:39:49,949 --> 00:39:53,269
-May God bless you all.
-Amen.

231
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:56,629
-God bless you.
-God bless you.

232
00:39:57,069 --> 00:39:58,349
And you also.

233
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,109
You fool, Dündar!

234
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,269
You fool, Dündar!

235
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:51,469
Doğan Alp died because of you.

236
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:56,149
His wife suffers.

237
00:40:57,909 --> 00:40:59,269
His child will be fatherless.

238
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:03,949
You don't deserve anything.

239
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:14,069
<i>Selamunaleykum</i>, Dündar Bey.

240
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:20,189
<i>Aleykumselamun</i>, sir.

241
00:41:23,629 --> 00:41:26,909
Come, Dündar Alp. Let's talk a little.

242
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:42,229
Our prophet tells us that...

243
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:45,429
if we had not sinned,

244
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:49,869
God would have destroyed us

245
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:54,349
and instead created sinning
and repenting servants.

246
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:56,989
What this means is

247
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:01,549
that we sin and make mistakes
because we are human.

248
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:06,349
God is happy that we repent
and take refuge in him.

249
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:14,709
Sir, what if this mistake caused
the death of an innocent.

250
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:18,909
What if a pregnant,
crying woman has been left behind?

251
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:25,589
Dündar Alp, no sin is greater
than God's mercy.

252
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:30,029
He forgives. He's happy to forgive.

253
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,949
The issue isn't not making mistakes...

254
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:37,469
it's understanding and not repeating them.

255
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:42,949
Sir...

256
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,389
I'm so angry with myself.

257
00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:50,189
I can't forgive myself.

258
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:55,269
You've learned your lesson.

259
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:58,709
But God does not love
those who go to extremes.

260
00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:02,909
You must obey your brother

261
00:43:03,669 --> 00:43:06,709
and carry out his commands
as best you can.

262
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:14,269
I'll never stray from my brother's path.

263
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:21,549
I'll do my best to serve my tribe.

264
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:28,549
That is the best thing you could do.

265
00:43:31,629 --> 00:43:33,349
May God grant you good fortune.

266
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:36,509
Amen sir. Amen.

267
00:43:39,709 --> 00:43:42,349
I have to go now. Excuse me.

268
00:43:44,629 --> 00:43:47,989
I like to wander around and enjoy nature.

269
00:43:53,669 --> 00:43:55,469
-Good day, sir.
-Thank you.

270
00:44:49,149 --> 00:44:51,709
Banu Çiçek, my sister.

271
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:58,429
The people of this tribe
are each a part of the same body.

272
00:45:01,189 --> 00:45:07,309
Just as a wound hurts the whole body,
so one person's problem disturbs us all.

273
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:14,629
Doğan was your husband and our brother.

274
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:18,829
But don't forget,

275
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:24,069
Doğan Alp's sacrifice has placed
a great responsibility upon you.

276
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:31,629
You must be even stronger now.

277
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:34,549
How can I be?

278
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:39,589
How can I overcome this, Halime Sultan?

279
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:45,709
God wouldn't give responsibility
to someone who couldn't shoulder it.

280
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:50,669
You sadden us.
We will certainly help you.

281
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:55,949
You're a woman of this tribe.

282
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:00,589
How could we abandon you, Banu Çiçek?

283
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:08,669
I feel your pain
but please forgive Dündar.

284
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:14,749
He made a mistake and regrets it deeply.

285
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:20,389
You should forgive him.

286
00:46:34,229 --> 00:46:36,669
Stand firm. See the man.

287
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:38,589
Hit like this. Let's go!

288
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:05,429
Who's against you?

289
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:08,749
-Who's against you?
-You are Bamsi Alp.

290
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:12,429
The enemy. The enemy!

291
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:14,109
We are enemies!

292
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:16,589
Why are you hitting me like I'm a carpet?

293
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:21,789
When you're hold this sword,

294
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:27,269
you don't look all kind and sweet
as if it's your lover in front of you.

295
00:47:28,709 --> 00:47:31,789
You look angry. You look angry!

296
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:36,989
As if you face an infidel.

297
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:40,469
As if you face an infidel! Go. Go.

298
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:42,789
Go.

299
00:47:52,429 --> 00:47:54,869
What are you doing? Drop the sword.

300
00:48:03,669 --> 00:48:05,709
No sword for you from now on.

301
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,309
-What are--
-Silence!

302
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:10,869
Go away and eat something.

303
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:15,029
Eat honey, drink some syrup.
Carry logs and rocks.

304
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:18,709
Don't return until you've
made these arms twice as big.

305
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:20,989
Go now. Go now!

306
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:22,709
Go.

307
00:48:34,149 --> 00:48:37,109
Brother, what are you doing?
You humiliated him.

308
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:41,909
I did it for his own good, brother.
Didn't you see him?

309
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:45,109
He couldn't carry
more than a couple of arrows!

310
00:48:46,029 --> 00:48:48,989
He has to be stronger. He has to eat.

311
00:48:49,269 --> 00:48:52,949
The infidel would eat that one alive,
brother.

312
00:48:56,789 --> 00:48:57,909
All right.

313
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,429
Come on, come on alps!

314
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:05,509
Brothers, attack as if
it is Vasilius' dogs before you!

315
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:09,029
As if you face an infidel! Go.

316
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:10,629
Come on, warriors!

317
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:13,269
Keep at it.

318
00:49:13,629 --> 00:49:17,389
As if he's an infidel. Keep at it.

319
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:24,709
The sultan's spy is worrying me, my Bey.

320
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:28,029
It's been a while since he last came.

321
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:33,789
And now this unit of soldiers
has arrived, without us knowing about it.

322
00:50:34,629 --> 00:50:37,429
My Bey, I fear he's been compromised.

323
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:42,069
Then we'll lose our link
with the emperor's palace.

324
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:45,029
We'll no longer be able to give
information to our Sultan.

325
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:52,869
Did you get a chance to meet
the Sultan in Konya, Artuk Bey?

326
00:50:53,029 --> 00:50:55,069
No, I didn't, my Bey.

327
00:50:55,989 --> 00:51:01,469
I believe I'll leave this world
without once seeing our Sultan.

328
00:51:04,509 --> 00:51:08,109
My Bey, when I got to the palace
it was unusually quiet.

329
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:13,869
Someone said our Sultan wasn't there.
I don't know if that was true.

330
00:51:16,709 --> 00:51:18,029
Let's hope for good news.

331
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:24,229
But everyone spoke highly of him.
The people are always praying for him.

332
00:51:26,629 --> 00:51:28,189
Thank God for him.

333
00:51:30,189 --> 00:51:33,989
We have to help
the merchants in the bazaar.

334
00:51:35,229 --> 00:51:39,949
We have to strengthen the reputation
and the security of the bazaar.

335
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:47,029
Nobody shall be taxed from now on.

336
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:48,989
As you command, my Bey.

337
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:53,549
At a time like this, freeing them from
taxes would relieve them greatly.

338
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:58,949
Support the merchants
with our gold as well.

339
00:52:00,269 --> 00:52:01,709
Protect them.

340
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:03,469
I've abolished interest, my Bey.

341
00:52:03,709 --> 00:52:08,429
They'll have all that they need
if you give gold to them too.

342
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:12,909
If they lose, we lose, Artuk Bey.

343
00:52:16,589 --> 00:52:21,469
But their prayers will
bring us prosperity.

344
00:52:21,989 --> 00:52:23,029
Thank you, my Bey.

345
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:32,509
Hold on, sir. Hold on. I'll get you out.

346
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:16,989
Spread out. You go that way.

347
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:19,749
One of them is injured. Look for blood.

348
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:21,149
Yes, sir.

349
00:53:47,669 --> 00:53:51,749
Don't worry, sir. I won't let you die.

350
00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:53,669
You'll live. Hold on.

351
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:42,549
Listen to me.

352
00:54:44,389 --> 00:54:47,509
Go to the Kayi tribe, quickly.
Find Ertuğrul Bey.

353
00:55:02,389 --> 00:55:03,429
Give this to him.

354
00:55:04,829 --> 00:55:08,989
Tell him to hurry before the eye
of the Sultan is blinded.

355
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:16,149
I bring information which is
very important for the state.

356
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:21,629
Sir, I can't leave you.

357
00:55:23,509 --> 00:55:27,669
Do as I say.
He must hear that message.

358
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:34,589
Don't worry, sir.
I'll give my life for this if necessary.

359
00:55:50,149 --> 00:55:51,269
We found this, sir.

360
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:05,469
It must belong to one of them.
There's blood on it.

361
00:56:05,709 --> 00:56:06,629
Maybe he's dead.

362
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,789
We can't be sure without a body.

363
00:56:10,189 --> 00:56:11,309
Keep looking.

364
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:15,109
I'll go to Governor Vasilius
to ask for help searching for the spy.

365
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:18,829
We have to catch them, dead or alive. Go.

366
00:56:54,189 --> 00:56:56,669
Did you leave your room at last, Çolpan?

367
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:59,789
Not Çolpan.

368
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:03,989
Ekaterina.

369
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:20,989
I'm glad you remembered
that you're a noblewoman, Ekaterina.

370
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:48,869
Whatever it was that
poisoned you in the past...

371
00:57:50,349 --> 00:57:53,229
you must get rid of it, Ekaterina.

372
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:58,429
You can start with the dagger
with which they stabbed us.

373
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:12,469
For the waist of a beautiful
woman like you...

374
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:17,069
a Byzantine dagger would go well.

375
00:58:21,869 --> 00:58:26,669
This dagger will go into the hearts
of our enemies, Governor.

376
00:58:29,469 --> 00:58:30,989
If I don't do it...

377
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:35,789
the baby inside me will.

378
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:43,789
Çolpan, are you with child?

379
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:49,549
Ural's last gift to me.
I'm carrying his child.

380
00:58:52,149 --> 00:58:53,709
That is great news!

381
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:56,949
I couldn't be any happier
if it was my child.

382
00:58:59,189 --> 00:59:03,029
This child will bring us our vengeance.

383
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:05,029
How?

384
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:10,229
When Aliyar and Aslıhan hear
that you're pregnant

385
00:59:11,269 --> 00:59:15,149
they'll have no choice but to show mercy
and take you back into the tribe.

386
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:18,989
And that mercy will bring about their end.

387
01:02:24,435 --> 01:02:25,715
Welcome.

388
01:02:26,315 --> 01:02:31,035
We have heard a lot about Ertuğrul Bey
through our friends.

389
01:02:32,955 --> 01:02:35,755
We are here to trade in peace.

390
01:02:38,195 --> 01:02:41,155
They call me
Ebu Mansur Muhammed in Aleppo.

391
01:02:41,955 --> 01:02:43,035
Welcome.

392
01:02:43,195 --> 01:02:45,115
You are more than welcome here.

393
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:49,395
I am Ertuğrul Bey's brother.
My name is Dündar.

394
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:52,355
Be our guest with your men.

395
01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:56,835
You have come from a long way,
get some rest.

396
01:02:58,155 --> 01:02:59,115
Thank you.

397
01:03:03,675 --> 01:03:06,915
I know that you are at war
with the Tekfur of Karacahisar.

398
01:03:07,115 --> 01:03:11,155
However...
you continue to trade with the Rums.

399
01:03:14,115 --> 01:03:17,915
These supplies will be sent
to the Rum people who need help.

400
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,475
To the Rum people?

401
01:03:21,915 --> 01:03:26,955
I have seen many states in my life.
But you are the only state...

402
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:29,555
that helps the people of the enemy.

403
01:03:29,915 --> 01:03:34,355
Ertuğrul Bey always gives support
to the indigent people.

404
01:03:34,915 --> 01:03:37,395
It seems Ertuğrul Bey
is not only a great warrior,

405
01:03:37,515 --> 01:03:39,035
but also a very generous man.

406
01:03:44,515 --> 01:03:47,395
This is my mother, Hayme.
And my brother's wife, Halime Sultan.

407
01:03:50,475 --> 01:03:51,635
Ebu Mansur.

408
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:55,675
He is a merchant from Aleppo, Mother.

409
01:03:55,835 --> 01:03:56,955
Welcome.

410
01:03:57,795 --> 01:03:58,875
Welcome.

411
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:05,435
So, you are the ones
who made those beautiful rugs

412
01:04:05,795 --> 01:04:08,075
which Europeans
have been rhapsodizing over.

413
01:04:08,275 --> 01:04:13,355
We are using our ancestors’ methods,
that's what makes our rugs so special.

414
01:04:14,315 --> 01:04:18,435
We weave our rugs with passion.

415
01:04:19,915 --> 01:04:22,155
I am here to talk about this.

416
01:04:22,915 --> 01:04:25,275
I want to place an order for many rugs.

417
01:04:28,675 --> 01:04:29,515
In fact...

418
01:04:34,195 --> 01:04:36,275
I will pay half of it right now.

419
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:37,275
I do not know how many more
generous merchants there are.

420
01:05:46,595 --> 01:05:49,555
Our rugs will please you.
You will not regret this.

421
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:54,315
But shouldn't we discuss it
with Ertuğrul Bey, Mother?

422
01:05:58,115 --> 01:06:02,155
Sister, I will explain it to my brother.
Don't worry about it.

423
01:06:04,195 --> 01:06:05,435
Fine. Okay.

424
01:06:08,035 --> 01:06:09,435
I am in no hurry.

425
01:06:10,355 --> 01:06:12,875
I am a very patient and wealthy man.

426
01:06:14,795 --> 01:06:17,075
You look familiar to me.

427
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:23,715
I have traveled to many cities,
and many places.

428
01:06:24,515 --> 01:06:26,315
We must have met somewhere.

429
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:32,195
Take care of our guests, Son.

430
01:06:32,995 --> 01:06:34,675
Let them rest well.

431
01:06:34,835 --> 01:06:37,755
Günkut, prepare food for our guests.

432
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:40,395
Take care of their horses too.
Let them rest.

433
01:06:41,275 --> 01:06:43,595
Come with me, Bey.
I will show you the way.

434
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:56,995
Mother, Dündar Bey,
I feel like I know him from somewhere...

435
01:06:58,635 --> 01:07:00,635
but I couldn't place where.

436
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:04,035
I have doubts about him.

437
01:07:05,195 --> 01:07:07,915
Neither he nor his men
look like merchants.

438
01:07:09,755 --> 01:07:11,555
They look like royal people.

439
01:07:23,635 --> 01:07:25,195
Kayi Tribe is here.

440
01:07:25,315 --> 01:07:26,915
And Cavdar Tribe is here.

441
01:07:27,155 --> 01:07:31,075
Hanlı Bazaar is in the middle of them.
Right here.

442
01:07:32,075 --> 01:07:33,275
As you said,

443
01:07:33,955 --> 01:07:35,715
if we took the Hanlı Baazar,

444
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:38,035
we would cut them off.

445
01:07:38,715 --> 01:07:40,635
Ertuğrul would lose his reputation.

446
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:45,195
Ertuğrul took Hanlı Bazaar
by trickery, anyway.

447
01:07:45,955 --> 01:07:47,475
Ertuğrul...

448
01:07:48,275 --> 01:07:52,275
has become more powerful
thanks to that bazaar.

449
01:07:52,595 --> 01:07:54,035
Now it will be his grave.

450
01:08:03,155 --> 01:08:07,355
The Emperor's guards are here, sir.
Their commander wants to see you.

451
01:08:09,755 --> 01:08:11,075
Let him come right away.

452
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:15,955
What are the Emperor's guards
doing here, Nikolas?

453
01:08:17,315 --> 01:08:19,955
The Emperor uses them
only for important matters.

454
01:08:21,195 --> 01:08:22,875
It means there is a serious matter.

455
01:08:31,835 --> 01:08:35,395
Tekfur Vasilius,
we need your soldiers' help.

456
01:08:36,515 --> 01:08:38,355
What is the matter, tell me.

457
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:41,275
At the Emperor's palace,
we have discovered a spy

458
01:08:41,435 --> 01:08:42,875
who is serving Sultan Alaeddin.

459
01:08:43,115 --> 01:08:44,435
I have tracked him down here.

460
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:46,555
What happened then?

461
01:08:46,715 --> 01:08:49,275
We attacked him
when he met another man this morning.

462
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:51,555
We had wounded the spy.

463
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:55,595
However, he managed to escape
with the other guy.

464
01:08:59,355 --> 01:09:02,195
Do you know
who this spy will contact?

465
01:09:02,395 --> 01:09:03,995
No, we do not know.

466
01:09:04,555 --> 01:09:07,275
We will never know
if we cannot catch them.

467
01:09:07,555 --> 01:09:09,715
It may take days to find them.

468
01:09:11,395 --> 01:09:13,115
We have found the spy's bag.

469
01:09:14,315 --> 01:09:15,675
His stuff is here.

470
01:09:16,675 --> 01:09:18,515
Spy's bag...

471
01:09:41,315 --> 01:09:43,715
I know how we can find him.

472
01:09:46,835 --> 01:09:49,395
Nikolas, prepare your best men,
we are setting off.

473
01:09:49,515 --> 01:09:50,595
Yes, sir.

474
01:10:50,795 --> 01:10:51,995
<i>Selamunaleykum.</i>

475
01:10:52,555 --> 01:10:53,715
<i>Aleykumselamun.</i>

476
01:10:55,995 --> 01:10:58,195
Your alps are in very good shape.

477
01:10:58,595 --> 01:11:00,835
They look as strong as a tiger.

478
01:11:02,515 --> 01:11:03,555
They are.

479
01:11:04,755 --> 01:11:06,115
We train all the time.

480
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:08,675
You know war is around the corner.

481
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:11,475
We need to be prepared.

482
01:11:12,395 --> 01:11:16,035
Are the other Turk tribes also
as ready for war as the Kayi Tribe?

483
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:20,995
They are.

484
01:11:22,395 --> 01:11:25,235
At our tribal meetings, Ertuğrul Bey
recommends to the Turkmen Beys

485
01:11:25,635 --> 01:11:27,755
that they should get their Alps ready.

486
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:29,955
He deals with them personally.

487
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:35,115
Does Ertuğrul Bey
only care about his Alps?

488
01:11:36,115 --> 01:11:38,515
I've heard that he is
also interested in politics.

489
01:11:40,555 --> 01:11:42,715
You will have to ask him
when he comes back.

490
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:46,275
Let's talk about rugs.

491
01:11:47,995 --> 01:11:50,675
You sound like
an experienced merchant, Dündar Bey.

492
01:11:52,315 --> 01:11:53,915
Actually, I am not a merchant.

493
01:12:02,395 --> 01:12:03,955
My brother has arrived.

494
01:12:20,355 --> 01:12:22,715
Alps, Ertuğrul Bey is here!

495
01:12:25,195 --> 01:12:28,675
-Welcome, Bey.
-Welcome, Bey.

496
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:31,715
-Welcome, Bey.
-Bey, welcome.

497
01:12:55,995 --> 01:12:57,595
May you never lose a fight!

498
01:12:58,155 --> 01:13:00,195
May you always be strong!

499
01:13:00,555 --> 01:13:03,075
Train well, Alps.

500
01:13:03,475 --> 01:13:05,275
Long live our Bey!

501
01:13:06,355 --> 01:13:07,995
That heathen Vasilius...

502
01:13:09,155 --> 01:13:11,115
is a blood-thirsty man,

503
01:13:11,915 --> 01:13:14,235
and now he summons
new soldiers from Nicaea.

504
01:13:15,355 --> 01:13:16,595
For this reason,

505
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:20,395
we will continue
to be cautious all the time.

506
01:13:20,715 --> 01:13:23,355
Our unity with the Turk Beys is strong!

507
01:13:25,755 --> 01:13:28,755
Prioritize your trainings.

508
01:13:30,595 --> 01:13:34,075
While our Sultan
is dealing with Mongols in the east,

509
01:13:34,275 --> 01:13:37,755
we will continue to make life here
unbearable for Vasilius.

510
01:13:42,035 --> 01:13:46,955
We will show our sultan
what we are made of!

511
01:13:49,595 --> 01:13:51,155
Come on, Alps,

512
01:13:51,275 --> 01:13:53,275
continue your training
with all your power.

513
01:13:53,435 --> 01:13:54,875
Yes, Bey!

514
01:13:57,075 --> 01:13:58,675
Go on, Alps.

515
01:14:26,155 --> 01:14:30,635
Sir, what I don't understand is
why these spies came here, but not Konya?

516
01:14:31,315 --> 01:14:34,995
There is another one who is
sending messages between Konya and Nicaea.

517
01:14:36,075 --> 01:14:38,355
He is here, in my lands.

518
01:14:40,035 --> 01:14:41,155
Who?

519
01:14:41,515 --> 01:14:43,235
-We will find out.
-How?

520
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,835
We are not the only ones
who are looking for the spy.

521
01:14:48,915 --> 01:14:51,995
The man who is sending messages
to the sultan

522
01:14:52,115 --> 01:14:54,035
must also have gone after the spy.

523
01:14:55,355 --> 01:14:57,555
If we find the spy before they do...

524
01:14:57,835 --> 01:15:02,475
Then we will also find
the traitor in my lands.

525
01:15:24,995 --> 01:15:26,315
Welcome, brother.

526
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,635
Thank you, Dündar.

527
01:15:29,795 --> 01:15:31,235
What is the situation?

528
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:33,795
Everything is all right, thank God.

529
01:15:34,115 --> 01:15:35,395
Good.

530
01:15:35,795 --> 01:15:36,835
Good.

531
01:15:39,555 --> 01:15:41,315
You have been working hard.

532
01:15:42,595 --> 01:15:44,875
You make me proud with your hard work.

533
01:15:47,715 --> 01:15:50,475
Now you deserve to be a Bey and an Alp.

534
01:15:53,075 --> 01:15:54,115
Bey...

535
01:15:55,955 --> 01:15:57,795
May God bless you, Bey.

536
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:03,555
You have honored me greatly.

537
01:16:06,715 --> 01:16:09,115
I also have good news for you, brother.

538
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:10,275
Tell me.

539
01:16:10,475 --> 01:16:13,115
A merchant came from Aleppo.
His name is Ebu Mansur.

540
01:16:13,515 --> 01:16:15,315
He has heard of our rugs' fame.

541
01:16:15,475 --> 01:16:16,795
And wants to buy some.

542
01:16:17,555 --> 01:16:19,315
And he paid a lot of gold coins.

543
01:16:20,755 --> 01:16:22,595
Now that's good news.

544
01:16:24,515 --> 01:16:25,475
Where is he now?

545
01:16:25,635 --> 01:16:26,755
He is there, brother.

546
01:16:29,475 --> 01:16:30,555
He was there.

547
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:33,315
How could he disappear suddenly?

548
01:16:34,675 --> 01:16:38,555
His disappearance means
he didn't want me to see him.

549
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:42,315
Halime said she knows him from somewhere,
but she couldn't remember where.

550
01:16:45,075 --> 01:16:46,595
We will find out.

551
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:48,195
Come, brother.

552
01:16:51,235 --> 01:16:53,835
Keep up your good work.

553
01:17:05,275 --> 01:17:07,915
Sir, the dogs smelled something. This way.

554
01:17:23,475 --> 01:17:27,315
You haven't said a single word
since you came back from Emir Sadettin.

555
01:17:28,235 --> 01:17:31,955
You used to ride horses,
train with your sword and go hunting.

556
01:17:32,795 --> 01:17:36,195
Now you are imprisoned in your tent,
like an eagle in a cage.

557
01:17:37,435 --> 01:17:39,475
I wanted to be a drop in the river.

558
01:17:41,435 --> 01:17:43,595
But fate locked me in a water bottle.

559
01:17:47,355 --> 01:17:49,755
I wanted to fly like a bird
in the savannah.

560
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,435
But fate wants me to imprison in a palace.

561
01:17:55,035 --> 01:17:56,235
Look, Sister,

562
01:17:57,075 --> 01:17:59,115
you are the only woman in my family.

563
01:17:59,635 --> 01:18:01,435
I promised my father
I would look after you.

564
01:18:01,795 --> 01:18:03,155
When I look at you...

565
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:07,755
I see my deceased mother.

566
01:18:10,915 --> 01:18:14,755
And for this reason,
I made you my deputy, Aslıhan.

567
01:18:16,635 --> 01:18:20,275
You don't say it by your tongue,
but I can see it in your eyes.

568
01:18:21,115 --> 01:18:23,035
So, I am asking one more time, Sister.

569
01:18:25,315 --> 01:18:27,035
Do you want to marry him?

570
01:18:35,235 --> 01:18:39,675
I do not want any hostility
between our state and our tribe, brother.

571
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:43,555
I am ready to sacrifice myself
for our tribe.

572
01:18:43,715 --> 01:18:47,355
No one can force you
into this marriage.

573
01:18:49,275 --> 01:18:50,995
It is too late now, brother.

574
01:18:51,315 --> 01:18:54,355
Do you think Emir Sadettin would just
give up on this marriage?

575
01:18:56,795 --> 01:18:58,515
I will accept my destiny.

576
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:01,435
You rest assured, Sister.

577
01:19:02,435 --> 01:19:07,315
As long as I live,
no one can force you into this.

578
01:19:08,915 --> 01:19:10,955
I would not use you for politics.

579
01:19:11,955 --> 01:19:13,435
Do not worry about it.

580
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:20,315
Thank God, I have you, brother.

581
01:19:23,115 --> 01:19:24,275
Amen, Sister.

582
01:19:25,515 --> 01:19:27,555
We will visit Ertuğrul Bey tonight.

583
01:19:27,955 --> 01:19:29,555
Get ready, Aslıhan.

584
01:19:30,155 --> 01:19:31,355
Yes, brother.

585
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:52,075
Sir, it started to rain,
the traces will be lost.

586
01:19:52,195 --> 01:19:54,035
Hurry, then! Hurry!

587
01:20:17,435 --> 01:20:19,235
Sir, they are hiding in the cave.

588
01:21:50,115 --> 01:21:52,155
We've been dealing with a lot of trouble.

589
01:21:52,755 --> 01:21:54,275
But thank God, anyway.

590
01:21:54,515 --> 01:21:56,355
We aren't going to leave our country.

591
01:21:56,515 --> 01:21:58,875
These lands are enough for all of us.

592
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:02,435
-Yes, they are.
-Right. It is enough.

593
01:22:03,955 --> 01:22:07,115
Does Ertuğrul Bey
have any involvement with all of this?

594
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:12,475
I swear to God,
we didn't see anything wrong from him.

595
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,875
He helped us all,
when we were having a hard time.

596
01:22:16,435 --> 01:22:18,915
He just remitted the taxes today.

597
01:22:19,595 --> 01:22:23,755
And he promised he will give
interest-free loans to the merchants.

598
01:22:25,435 --> 01:22:27,275
You want to work with us.

599
01:22:28,115 --> 01:22:29,755
But we can't promise you anything,

600
01:22:29,835 --> 01:22:31,475
since we don't know
what's going to happen.

601
01:22:31,835 --> 01:22:33,795
We do not want to let you down.

602
01:22:38,635 --> 01:22:40,395
Were you going to say something, Aleko?

603
01:22:43,795 --> 01:22:45,915
I was going to ask if you have an order.

604
01:22:47,675 --> 01:22:49,115
Bring meat to my guests.

605
01:22:49,875 --> 01:22:51,195
Bring sherbet to them.

606
01:22:51,755 --> 01:22:53,875
And do not disappoint me.

607
01:22:54,475 --> 01:22:55,915
Yes, Bey.

608
01:23:01,955 --> 01:23:04,595
You go and prepare a good meal,
do not disappoint us.

609
01:23:04,715 --> 01:23:05,835
I will be right with you.

610
01:23:16,915 --> 01:23:18,875
They play politics at the table.

611
01:23:19,675 --> 01:23:21,835
I do not like this man, Dumrul Alp.

612
01:23:22,115 --> 01:23:23,595
He has booked the entire in.

613
01:23:25,355 --> 01:23:27,035
I even couldn't find rooms for all them.

614
01:23:27,195 --> 01:23:28,995
It does not matter, Aleko.

615
01:23:29,435 --> 01:23:32,075
They would never leave Ebu Mansur alone.

616
01:23:35,035 --> 01:23:37,675
They don't look like
they will sleep tonight.

617
01:23:45,035 --> 01:23:46,235
Dumrul Alp,

618
01:23:46,635 --> 01:23:48,955
I fear that Vasilius is behind this.

619
01:23:49,715 --> 01:23:51,235
Do not worry, Aleko.

620
01:23:51,395 --> 01:23:53,795
Our Alp will stay all night long.

621
01:23:54,595 --> 01:23:57,755
And I will go to our tribe, and
inform Ertuğrul Bey about this man.

622
01:23:58,075 --> 01:24:00,675
Bey should know what this man is doing.

623
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:06,515
Sorry to bother you.

624
01:25:08,155 --> 01:25:09,635
Did we wake you up?

625
01:25:35,555 --> 01:25:36,875
Tell me...

626
01:25:37,875 --> 01:25:43,075
Who is your spy
in Sultan Alaeddin's lands?

627
01:25:46,395 --> 01:25:47,955
Tell me, who are you waiting for?

628
01:25:48,075 --> 01:25:49,235
Speak!

629
01:25:55,755 --> 01:25:57,475
I am waiting for Azrael.

630
01:25:57,955 --> 01:25:59,235
You bastard!

631
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:30,795
Commander Vasilius, there were two men,
one of them is missing.

632
01:26:56,395 --> 01:26:57,715
Just as I guessed.

633
01:26:57,955 --> 01:27:01,275
The missing spy
will get us the sultan's man.

634
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:05,555
Get your soldiers ready.

635
01:27:06,115 --> 01:27:09,795
We will ambush them when they come.

636
01:27:26,035 --> 01:27:27,635
In the name of God.

637
01:27:28,275 --> 01:27:32,555
Thank God, we can share the same food now.
May God bless our food.

638
01:27:33,115 --> 01:27:34,435
-Amen.
-Amen.

639
01:27:34,955 --> 01:27:36,035
Amen.

640
01:27:37,075 --> 01:27:38,275
Enjoy your meal.

641
01:27:47,915 --> 01:27:49,035
Thank you.

642
01:27:49,275 --> 01:27:52,075
Our food will be more blessed,
God willing.

643
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:54,275
A merchant came today.

644
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:58,915
He has heard about the fame of the rugs
which we made for Europeans.

645
01:28:01,555 --> 01:28:02,755
Thank God.

646
01:28:04,075 --> 01:28:05,635
We are lucky now.

647
01:28:06,395 --> 01:28:08,355
We are starting to solve our problems.

648
01:28:10,115 --> 01:28:12,355
You deserve this, my dear.

649
01:28:13,355 --> 01:28:18,555
God always gives you what you deserve.

650
01:28:20,675 --> 01:28:22,755
We will unite again.

651
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:25,195
We will weave rugs and earn gold coins.

652
01:28:26,235 --> 01:28:28,195
-God willing.
-God willing.

653
01:28:29,155 --> 01:28:31,555
The rugs' fame traveled fast,
Ertuğrul Bey.

654
01:28:32,795 --> 01:28:34,035
Wonderful, Sister.

655
01:28:34,195 --> 01:28:35,915
Something is not right about this.

656
01:28:36,835 --> 01:28:38,235
I have been thinking about it.

657
01:28:38,515 --> 01:28:41,035
The merchant gave us
a lot of gold coins, Bey.

658
01:28:41,675 --> 01:28:43,035
As a down payment.

659
01:28:43,355 --> 01:28:45,715
Then he vanished into thin air.

660
01:28:47,315 --> 01:28:48,395
He did.

661
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:52,795
He gave lots of gold coins,
and then vanished into thin air?

662
01:28:53,235 --> 01:28:54,755
It is a good job, Ertuğrul Bey.

663
01:28:54,915 --> 01:28:59,235
However, I wonder who this man is,
where is he coming from?

664
01:28:59,795 --> 01:29:02,475
He said his name was Ebu Mansur.

665
01:29:03,315 --> 01:29:04,635
He comes from Aleppo.

666
01:29:05,195 --> 01:29:06,555
That is what he said to Dündar.

667
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:11,155
I think I know him from somewhere,
but I couldn't place where.

668
01:29:13,315 --> 01:29:15,435
I hope his intentions are good,

669
01:29:16,155 --> 01:29:19,595
because this job is very important
for both of our tribes.

670
01:29:21,355 --> 01:29:23,035
May I come in, Bey?

671
01:29:23,475 --> 01:29:24,595
Come in, Dumrul.

672
01:29:30,035 --> 01:29:31,515
Bey, I have come from the inn.

673
01:29:31,915 --> 01:29:34,515
A merchant named Ebu Mansur
has come to the inn.

674
01:29:36,515 --> 01:29:39,195
So, he vanished into thin air,
and then showed up at the inn?

675
01:29:39,355 --> 01:29:41,155
He talked with the merchants.

676
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:43,595
He talked about trade, and politics.

677
01:29:43,955 --> 01:29:45,715
He kept asking questions.

678
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:47,075
Asked about their business,

679
01:29:47,235 --> 01:29:50,155
about the situation in the land,
and about Byzantine.

680
01:29:50,595 --> 01:29:52,035
He is a silver-tongued man, Bey.

681
01:29:52,275 --> 01:29:54,435
People pay close attention
to what he says.

682
01:29:55,275 --> 01:29:57,435
He earned everybody's respect
in no time at all.

683
01:30:05,355 --> 01:30:06,835
Thank you, Dumrul.

684
01:30:07,275 --> 01:30:08,635
Thank you.

685
01:30:08,835 --> 01:30:10,595
You keep an eye on him.

686
01:30:10,795 --> 01:30:11,995
Keep watching him.

687
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:13,355
Yes, Bey.

688
01:30:21,035 --> 01:30:23,755
He is just a merchant
who wants to buy rugs, Ertuğrul Bey.

689
01:30:24,115 --> 01:30:25,515
Why is he asking so many questions?

690
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:28,515
We will find out, Aliyar Bey.

691
01:30:29,235 --> 01:30:30,435
We will find out.

692
01:30:53,035 --> 01:30:55,075
Easy, Bamsi, you will choke.

693
01:30:57,435 --> 01:30:59,795
Are you in a hurry,
are you going somewhere?

694
01:31:02,595 --> 01:31:04,555
Hafsa Hatun...

695
01:31:05,795 --> 01:31:08,675
Where did you learn to cook like this?

696
01:31:09,995 --> 01:31:12,555
Thanks to Mother Hayme,
she teaches me everything.

697
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:15,955
Of course, of course she does.

698
01:31:16,155 --> 01:31:18,035
This is Mother Hayme's dish.

699
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:26,075
Hafsa Hatun, I mean,
you made it delicious, of course.

700
01:31:29,715 --> 01:31:35,235
I wish my brothers could see me like this.

701
01:31:35,915 --> 01:31:40,155
I wish they knew
how happy Bamsi Alp is now.

702
01:31:40,955 --> 01:31:44,315
All the single men would envy me.

703
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:48,035
I wish...

704
01:31:49,075 --> 01:31:51,275
Now I understand, Bamsi.

705
01:31:51,475 --> 01:31:53,875
You want to go to your brothers.

706
01:31:54,155 --> 01:31:55,995
No, no way.

707
01:31:56,235 --> 01:31:58,715
No way, my love.

708
01:31:59,115 --> 01:32:03,555
I mean, of course,
my brothers want to see me,

709
01:32:03,795 --> 01:32:05,755
but I told them...

710
01:32:05,955 --> 01:32:10,155
I told them Bamsi Alp would never leave
his woman in the tent and go.

711
01:32:16,835 --> 01:32:17,835
Go now.

712
01:32:18,515 --> 01:32:21,435
And tell them
Hafsa Hatun knows your heart.

713
01:32:21,675 --> 01:32:25,115
If her lover
would be happy with his brothers,

714
01:32:25,275 --> 01:32:28,035
then she will be patient
and wait for him to come back.

715
01:32:28,275 --> 01:32:31,155
Okay, then. Good.

716
01:32:31,875 --> 01:32:34,155
Wonderful. My wonderful woman.

717
01:32:36,435 --> 01:32:38,275
Thank God for giving you to me.

718
01:32:38,435 --> 01:32:39,595
Wonderful woman.

719
01:32:39,715 --> 01:32:41,555
I am going then.

720
01:33:00,115 --> 01:33:01,235
My dear,

721
01:33:01,835 --> 01:33:05,035
you look too thoughtful.

722
01:33:08,755 --> 01:33:10,275
Why are you worried?

723
01:33:12,355 --> 01:33:14,755
I am fine. I was thinking about the rugs.

724
01:33:15,155 --> 01:33:16,955
And my marriage.

725
01:33:18,675 --> 01:33:20,955
I felt sad, because I won't be with you.

726
01:33:24,995 --> 01:33:26,195
Do not worry, my dear.

727
01:33:26,475 --> 01:33:28,275
Your marriage is more important.

728
01:33:28,475 --> 01:33:32,035
We can finish the rugs without you.

729
01:33:35,075 --> 01:33:38,155
So... did you set a day for the wedding?

730
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:46,715
Our sultan has vanished into thin air.

731
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:49,155
We had to postpone the wedding.

732
01:33:50,715 --> 01:33:53,515
We will marry when Emir Sadettin is here.

733
01:33:55,115 --> 01:33:56,475
Let's hope for the best.

734
01:33:56,955 --> 01:33:59,955
Maybe it is better to postpone it.

735
01:34:02,955 --> 01:34:06,195
-Brother...
-They are like family to us, Aslıhan.

736
01:34:07,715 --> 01:34:09,395
We have nothing to hide from them.

737
01:34:15,675 --> 01:34:17,115
What is happening, Aliyar Bey?

738
01:34:18,355 --> 01:34:19,595
What is the matter?

739
01:34:22,995 --> 01:34:24,755
I told my sister as well, Ertuğrul Bey...

740
01:34:26,155 --> 01:34:27,675
If she doesn't want...

741
01:34:29,755 --> 01:34:31,715
Halime, are you okay?

742
01:34:32,555 --> 01:34:33,755
Halime, are you okay?

743
01:34:35,435 --> 01:34:36,515
Lie down here.

744
01:34:37,195 --> 01:34:38,075
Easy.

745
01:34:39,275 --> 01:34:41,195
Mother, my baby is coming.

746
01:34:45,315 --> 01:34:47,515
Go and tell Artuk Bey, my dear, quick.

747
01:34:47,595 --> 01:34:49,475
-Okay.
-My dear.

748
01:35:11,035 --> 01:35:12,915
Bamsi said he'd come,
before we finish eating.

749
01:35:14,955 --> 01:35:16,275
But he has not come yet.

750
01:35:20,555 --> 01:35:23,035
He is just married, Turgut Alp.

751
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:26,075
And it is not easy to leave your love.

752
01:35:26,915 --> 01:35:28,555
He will come, brother.

753
01:35:29,435 --> 01:35:31,115
I am here, brothers.

754
01:35:33,235 --> 01:35:34,835
My brother is here!

755
01:35:34,995 --> 01:35:36,715
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

756
01:35:36,955 --> 01:35:38,835
You look good.

757
01:35:39,155 --> 01:35:40,795
-You look good, brothers.
-Sit down.

758
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:42,075
Okay.

759
01:35:42,475 --> 01:35:45,115
I told you, Bamsi
would never leave his brothers alone.

760
01:35:45,555 --> 01:35:46,515
Welcome, brother.

761
01:35:47,235 --> 01:35:49,035
Thank you, brother.

762
01:35:49,195 --> 01:35:51,035
Would I ever leave you alone?

763
01:35:51,195 --> 01:35:52,275
Thank you, brother.

764
01:35:53,675 --> 01:35:56,035
Did you say the same thing to Hafsa Hatun?

765
01:35:56,155 --> 01:35:58,435
You said you wouldn't leave your brothers?

766
01:36:01,275 --> 01:36:02,795
No.

767
01:36:02,955 --> 01:36:06,915
I told Hafsa Hatun,
"There is an impertinent man among Alps,

768
01:36:07,035 --> 01:36:09,995
his name is Günkut,
and he has a big mouth,

769
01:36:10,115 --> 01:36:14,635
I will take care of him first,
and then come back." Come here!

770
01:36:14,715 --> 01:36:16,275
Come here, Günkut.

771
01:36:16,395 --> 01:36:18,275
Come here! Come!

772
01:36:21,835 --> 01:36:25,835
I don't even feel like
getting mad at you.

773
01:36:26,395 --> 01:36:28,355
Do not worry, come.

774
01:36:28,555 --> 01:36:30,635
Come and eat, Günkut, come.

775
01:36:31,275 --> 01:36:33,115
Do not worry, come.

776
01:36:39,195 --> 01:36:40,875
Go on, sit, brother.

777
01:36:41,875 --> 01:36:43,155
Mischief!

778
01:36:52,035 --> 01:36:53,995
This is love, brother.

779
01:36:54,635 --> 01:36:56,355
It makes flowers burst in your heart.

780
01:36:56,955 --> 01:36:59,595
You lose all your worries and anger.

781
01:37:00,555 --> 01:37:03,155
You are right, brother, you are right.

782
01:37:03,315 --> 01:37:07,355
However, brothers I have learned
that there are two kinds of women;

783
01:37:07,715 --> 01:37:09,995
one makes flowers burst in your heart,

784
01:37:10,355 --> 01:37:13,275
and the other one withers your flowers.

785
01:37:17,035 --> 01:37:18,555
You said it well, brother,

786
01:37:19,155 --> 01:37:21,275
but how can we find a woman like that?

787
01:37:21,435 --> 01:37:23,115
How can we understand
which woman gives love

788
01:37:23,315 --> 01:37:24,595
and which gives pain?

789
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:28,515
My brother, my dear brother...

790
01:37:28,675 --> 01:37:32,795
You will beg God, like this, brother,
and you will pray.

791
01:37:32,955 --> 01:37:35,315
With good intentions, of course.

792
01:37:35,595 --> 01:37:39,355
And then you will find your woman
dropped out of the sky.

793
01:37:39,675 --> 01:37:43,195
Like an apple falls from the tree.

794
01:37:48,155 --> 01:37:49,275
Let's eat.

795
01:37:49,435 --> 01:37:50,635
Enjoy your meal.

796
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:57,995
You talk about
apples, and flowers, Bamsi, but...

797
01:37:59,235 --> 01:38:00,635
You have come here hungry.

798
01:38:00,795 --> 01:38:02,155
Didn't your wife feed you?

799
01:38:07,475 --> 01:38:10,195
Now, you deserve a good beating, brother.

800
01:38:10,315 --> 01:38:12,035
You deserve a good beating.

801
01:38:12,235 --> 01:38:14,035
Come here, come!

802
01:38:14,155 --> 01:38:15,235
Help me God!

803
01:38:15,395 --> 01:38:17,475
You deserve a good beating. Come here!

804
01:38:20,275 --> 01:38:22,395
In the name of God.

805
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:52,955
Halime Sultan is not well, Bey.

806
01:38:55,875 --> 01:38:57,715
The birth has started.

807
01:38:57,835 --> 01:38:59,675
But something is not right.

808
01:39:04,755 --> 01:39:06,755
Go and bring the midwifes.

809
01:39:07,035 --> 01:39:08,475
I will bring them.

810
01:39:10,515 --> 01:39:13,115
Hafsa Hatun, prepare some hot water.

811
01:39:13,235 --> 01:39:15,115
We will need it when the midwife comes.

812
01:39:15,275 --> 01:39:16,475
Yes, Artuk Bey.

813
01:39:42,115 --> 01:39:43,755
My dear.

814
01:40:25,795 --> 01:40:27,235
What's the situation, Artuk Bey?

815
01:40:27,635 --> 01:40:29,835
We cannot be hopeless now, sir.

816
01:40:29,955 --> 01:40:31,635
We'll do whatever we can.

817
01:40:32,795 --> 01:40:35,635
However, the baby could be breech.

818
01:40:55,595 --> 01:40:58,355
Sir, this man wants to see you.

819
01:40:59,715 --> 01:41:01,035
He says it's important.

820
01:41:02,955 --> 01:41:04,115
What could it be?

821
01:41:09,235 --> 01:41:10,315
Who are you?

822
01:41:10,955 --> 01:41:13,755
Sir, I was sent by the eye of the Sultan.

823
01:41:37,475 --> 01:41:38,675
Come here.

824
01:41:45,395 --> 01:41:47,395
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

825
01:41:48,235 --> 01:41:49,395
Let's go.

826
01:41:50,115 --> 01:41:51,835
<i>Bismillah. </i>Here we go.

827
01:41:52,435 --> 01:41:54,355
God help us.

828
01:41:54,595 --> 01:41:55,675
A little more to go.

829
01:41:55,795 --> 01:41:57,755
It'll be over in an instant.

830
01:41:58,235 --> 01:41:59,315
Come on.

831
01:41:59,715 --> 01:42:00,835
Come on.

832
01:42:00,995 --> 01:42:03,675
Stay calm, all of you.

833
01:42:09,642 --> 01:42:10,875
One more push.

834
01:42:11,035 --> 01:42:12,315
Come on.

835
01:42:12,635 --> 01:42:14,355
Push, Halime Sultan.

836
01:42:16,715 --> 01:42:17,635
Come on.

837
01:42:17,755 --> 01:42:19,795
It's almost over.

838
01:42:23,435 --> 01:42:24,715
Yes, come on.

839
01:42:24,915 --> 01:42:26,115
Keep pushing, dear.

840
01:42:26,235 --> 01:42:27,275
My dear.

841
01:42:28,515 --> 01:42:30,195
It's almost out, Halime Sultan.

842
01:42:30,355 --> 01:42:31,675
A little more to go.

843
01:42:31,835 --> 01:42:33,395
-Push.
-Halime Sultan.

844
01:42:33,515 --> 01:42:35,715
Just a bit more.

845
01:42:55,515 --> 01:42:57,195
Where is the eye of the sultan?

846
01:42:57,875 --> 01:42:59,155
Why did he send you?

847
01:42:59,315 --> 01:43:01,115
His eye's identity was revealed.

848
01:43:01,915 --> 01:43:03,355
He had to escape from the castle.

849
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:04,835
Are you serious?

850
01:43:05,395 --> 01:43:08,275
We were ambushed at our
meeting point with the eye.

851
01:43:08,995 --> 01:43:09,995
He was wounded.

852
01:43:10,475 --> 01:43:12,835
I had to hide him in a cave I found.

853
01:43:13,395 --> 01:43:14,755
He's dying.

854
01:43:15,435 --> 01:43:19,315
However, he told me that
he had something important to tell you.

855
01:43:20,475 --> 01:43:23,275
He wants to see you before he dies.

856
01:43:50,195 --> 01:43:51,835
Who were you going to meet?

857
01:43:55,835 --> 01:43:59,675
Where were you taking the information
you gathered at the palace?

858
01:43:59,875 --> 01:44:00,995
Speak.

859
01:44:09,955 --> 01:44:13,035
Go to hell, Vasilius.

860
01:44:15,795 --> 01:44:17,435
Even if you don't tell me now,

861
01:44:18,075 --> 01:44:21,795
I'll find out once he comes
to save you anyway.

862
01:44:23,035 --> 01:44:24,635
Shut your mouth!

863
01:44:59,155 --> 01:45:03,675
Curses be on you, Vasilius.

864
01:45:04,555 --> 01:45:07,915
Damn you and your emperor!

865
01:45:34,395 --> 01:45:37,035
Turgut, prepare your best men.

866
01:45:37,395 --> 01:45:38,995
We've received an important mission.

867
01:45:39,155 --> 01:45:40,515
Yes, sir.

868
01:45:40,795 --> 01:45:44,275
Ertuğrul Bey, I may not be able
to find my way back in the dark.

869
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:46,795
We wait till morning and the eye dies.

870
01:45:49,275 --> 01:45:52,435
Ertuğrul Bey, daytime
would be better for us than nighttime.

871
01:45:52,555 --> 01:45:54,155
We couldn't find him if we went now.

872
01:45:54,315 --> 01:45:55,995
The sun will rise soon.

873
01:46:06,995 --> 01:46:09,635
Tell Ishak to get ready,
he'll be coming with us.

874
01:46:10,755 --> 01:46:12,035
Our man is injured.

875
01:46:12,995 --> 01:46:14,915
-Yes, sir.
-As you wish, sir.

876
01:46:56,035 --> 01:46:59,195
Ebu Mansur,
I've things to tell you if I may.

877
01:47:06,395 --> 01:47:07,595
I'm listening.

878
01:47:07,715 --> 01:47:10,635
The jackal left
with the rest of its pack today.

879
01:47:14,675 --> 01:47:16,635
He probably got the scent
of game, then.

880
01:47:17,155 --> 01:47:18,475
Which way did they go?

881
01:47:18,595 --> 01:47:20,195
To a place called Nikos Hill.

882
01:47:28,555 --> 01:47:32,195
Once jackals go hunting,
lions can't stand still.

883
01:48:05,315 --> 01:48:07,435
The baby doesn't want to come out easily.

884
01:48:07,835 --> 01:48:08,995
It's breech.

885
01:48:10,675 --> 01:48:12,035
Push, Halime Sultan.

886
01:48:12,155 --> 01:48:14,435
Endure it just a bit more.

887
01:48:14,595 --> 01:48:15,795
Push.

888
01:48:15,915 --> 01:48:17,755
My dear.

889
01:48:17,955 --> 01:48:19,715
Come on. Just a bit more.

890
01:48:19,795 --> 01:48:21,395
Push, my dear.

891
01:48:23,155 --> 01:48:24,355
Keep going, Sister.

892
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:27,955
Come on Halime Hatun.
Just a bit more.

893
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:30,675
Come on, my dear.

894
01:48:30,795 --> 01:48:33,115
God help me.

895
01:48:52,795 --> 01:48:53,835
Son.

896
01:48:56,595 --> 01:48:58,075
Why are you awake?

897
01:49:00,035 --> 01:49:02,875
I'm waiting for the baby to be born.

898
01:49:02,995 --> 01:49:04,875
Are you waiting for it too?

899
01:49:06,555 --> 01:49:08,515
As we wait for the sunrise,

900
01:49:08,955 --> 01:49:10,835
we are waiting for that as well.

901
01:49:11,115 --> 01:49:13,115
What if it doesn't come?

902
01:49:14,515 --> 01:49:15,835
Why would that be?

903
01:49:16,155 --> 01:49:18,275
It'll come, just as you did.

904
01:49:18,515 --> 01:49:20,955
Did you wait for me too, Daddy?

905
01:49:24,755 --> 01:49:26,875
Of course we did, Son.

906
01:49:27,755 --> 01:49:30,875
If you want to see the baby soon,
you must go to bed.

907
01:49:31,795 --> 01:49:33,875
Then you'll be able to see it faster.

908
01:49:34,555 --> 01:49:35,915
I want to see my mom.

909
01:49:37,395 --> 01:49:39,635
Not now, Son.

910
01:49:40,675 --> 01:49:42,875
Go on, now.

911
01:49:43,595 --> 01:49:44,675
Come on.

912
01:49:51,355 --> 01:49:52,595
Gunduz.

913
01:50:04,435 --> 01:50:05,635
May I come in, sir?

914
01:50:05,875 --> 01:50:07,035
Come in, Turgut.

915
01:50:12,675 --> 01:50:14,155
The sun will rise any minute now.

916
01:50:16,635 --> 01:50:17,835
All right.

917
01:50:34,715 --> 01:50:36,275
What is the situation, Artuk Bey?

918
01:50:37,275 --> 01:50:39,355
It's not good, sir.

919
01:50:40,675 --> 01:50:42,515
God help her.

920
01:50:48,315 --> 01:50:50,675
Ertuğrul Bey, we can go
to save the man if you'd like.

921
01:50:51,115 --> 01:50:52,995
You can stay with Halime Sultan.

922
01:50:55,835 --> 01:50:58,115
We swore to protect our country.

923
01:50:59,635 --> 01:51:03,195
My baby will come into this world
without me and live freely.

924
01:51:07,995 --> 01:51:10,435
Turgut, prepare the horses.

925
01:51:12,355 --> 01:51:13,635
Yes, sir.

926
01:51:22,435 --> 01:51:23,395
I'm coming in.

927
01:51:24,395 --> 01:51:25,435
Son.

928
01:51:31,035 --> 01:51:32,235
Ertuğrul!

929
01:51:36,915 --> 01:51:40,075
Halime, bear with me.

930
01:51:40,515 --> 01:51:41,875
Endure it.

931
01:51:42,355 --> 01:51:45,475
God will help both you and our baby.

932
01:51:51,875 --> 01:51:53,595
Son, you're getting in the way.

933
01:51:56,155 --> 01:51:57,555
I'll be back, Halime.

934
01:51:57,835 --> 01:51:59,595
No matter what.

935
01:52:07,675 --> 01:52:09,155
Come on, dear.

936
01:52:09,675 --> 01:52:11,155
Push.

937
01:52:19,875 --> 01:52:21,755
Take good care of her, Artuk Bey.

938
01:52:23,075 --> 01:52:25,035
Leave it to me, sir.

939
01:52:25,355 --> 01:52:27,355
We'll do our best.

940
01:52:27,995 --> 01:52:29,355
It'll be all right.

941
01:52:30,715 --> 01:52:31,875
Thank you.

942
01:52:32,675 --> 01:52:33,795
Let us leave.

943
01:52:47,515 --> 01:52:49,315
Halime, just a bit more.

944
01:53:15,595 --> 01:53:18,915
Ebu Mansur, just as you said
the lion went for the hunt.

945
01:53:24,675 --> 01:53:25,795
Which way?

946
01:53:28,235 --> 01:53:29,635
To where the jackal is.

947
01:53:46,315 --> 01:53:47,755
Ebu Mansur.

948
01:53:48,875 --> 01:53:50,395
Where are you going, sir?

949
01:53:50,515 --> 01:53:52,595
Ertuğrul Bey was coming here to see you.

950
01:53:53,435 --> 01:53:56,715
I have enough respect for him
to not make him wait, Dumrul Alp.

951
01:53:57,995 --> 01:54:00,435
I'll be back before he comes.

952
01:54:18,995 --> 01:54:22,315
Tell our men to find out
where that man is going.

953
01:55:20,555 --> 01:55:22,155
It's okay, my dear

954
01:55:24,515 --> 01:55:26,075
Take deep breaths.

955
01:55:26,435 --> 01:55:28,475
Deep breaths, Halime Sultan.

956
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:31,315
Breathe in, breathe out.

957
01:55:32,315 --> 01:55:34,675
Breathe in, breathe out.

958
01:55:34,955 --> 01:55:36,755
Breathe, Sister.
Breathe out.

959
01:55:43,235 --> 01:55:45,035
God help us.

960
01:55:47,595 --> 01:55:48,675
Ertuğrul.

961
01:55:49,835 --> 01:55:50,795
Ertuğrul.

962
01:55:52,435 --> 01:55:54,355
<i>Dear God!</i>

963
01:55:55,155 --> 01:55:59,435
<i>Heaven and earth, be my witness.</i>

964
01:55:59,515 --> 01:56:01,755
<i>I'll be a father!</i>

965
01:56:02,635 --> 01:56:04,515
<i>Ertuğrul, not in the next winter quarters,</i>

966
01:56:05,915 --> 01:56:07,995
<i>nor in any other place we go,</i>

967
01:56:09,155 --> 01:56:12,315
don't you ever make your son wonder
where you are and cry.

968
01:56:15,355 --> 01:56:17,075
I don't know when I'll die,

969
01:56:17,995 --> 01:56:19,395
or what my fate is.

970
01:56:20,315 --> 01:56:21,195
However,

971
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:24,315
as long as I'm alive,

972
01:56:25,235 --> 01:56:28,275
know that I'd never

973
01:56:29,155 --> 01:56:31,675
let you or our son suffer.

974
01:56:32,355 --> 01:56:33,995
<i>Never leave our side.</i>

975
01:56:37,635 --> 01:56:38,595
My dear.

976
01:56:41,155 --> 01:56:42,355
Bring hot water.

977
01:56:42,435 --> 01:56:43,515
I'll do it.

978
01:56:45,995 --> 01:56:47,155
Breathe in.

979
01:56:51,875 --> 01:56:55,875
God, don't take my girl and my baby.

980
01:56:56,755 --> 01:56:58,315
God help us.

981
01:56:59,635 --> 01:57:00,595
Here.

982
01:57:01,075 --> 01:57:03,515
Endure it, Sister. Stay strong.

983
01:57:05,875 --> 01:57:08,595
-Bear with it, Sister.
-Here, my dear.

984
01:57:08,955 --> 01:57:10,355
Push.

985
01:57:10,555 --> 01:57:11,795
Keep pushing.

986
01:57:11,995 --> 01:57:13,755
God help us.

987
01:57:15,275 --> 01:57:16,395
Come on.

988
01:57:16,595 --> 01:57:18,355
Come on, dear.

989
01:57:18,475 --> 01:57:20,235
Take deep breaths.

990
01:58:03,275 --> 01:58:04,475
Let Governor Vasilius know.

991
01:58:04,955 --> 01:58:06,195
Ertuğrul and his men are coming.

992
01:58:53,675 --> 01:58:55,195
We'll go on foot from here.

993
01:59:01,075 --> 01:59:01,995
Turgut.

994
01:59:04,355 --> 01:59:05,395
Aliyar Bey.

995
01:59:06,515 --> 01:59:07,435
Be careful.

996
01:59:08,035 --> 01:59:09,515
All right, Ertuğrul Bey.

997
01:59:09,835 --> 01:59:10,795
Right, sir.

998
01:59:11,875 --> 01:59:12,795
Let's go.

999
01:59:44,755 --> 01:59:46,835
Sir, Ertuğrul and his men are coming.

1000
01:59:47,235 --> 01:59:49,755
They left their horses
and are climbing up the hill.

1001
01:59:53,515 --> 01:59:54,995
Ertuğrul.

1002
01:59:56,315 --> 01:59:59,235
So, the spy of the sultan in this land

1003
01:59:59,995 --> 02:00:01,035
was Ertuğrul, huh?

1004
02:00:01,155 --> 02:00:02,955
He turned out to be strong after all.

1005
02:00:04,155 --> 02:00:05,155
He was strong.

1006
02:00:05,515 --> 02:00:06,555
But not anymore.

1007
02:00:08,475 --> 02:00:11,675
I'll never wipe your blood
off my sword, Ertuğrul.

1008
02:00:13,395 --> 02:00:15,835
Nikolas, let's go.

1009
02:00:17,875 --> 02:00:20,955
Men! Hide as I instructed you.

1010
02:00:21,435 --> 02:00:23,395
Nobody moves without my orders.

1011
02:00:31,715 --> 02:00:33,995
Come now, Ertuğrul.

1012
02:01:25,875 --> 02:01:26,915
Dear God.

1013
02:01:28,195 --> 02:01:31,115
You gave us all kinds of fruits,

1014
02:01:32,115 --> 02:01:33,915
budding fruit trees,

1015
02:01:35,475 --> 02:01:39,835
and sweet-smelling flowers.

1016
02:01:41,075 --> 02:01:44,035
Your existence, your singularity,

1017
02:01:44,595 --> 02:01:46,715
your beauty and your perfection

1018
02:01:47,595 --> 02:01:50,115
are evident in all that exists.

1019
02:01:51,715 --> 02:01:54,715
For the love of all your beautiful names,

1020
02:01:55,635 --> 02:01:57,515
please bless us with your guidance.

1021
02:01:58,675 --> 02:01:59,875
Oh, God!

1022
02:02:00,835 --> 02:02:03,915
You granted sainthood
to the prophet Joseph

1023
02:02:04,115 --> 02:02:06,355
who was thrown into a pitch black well.

1024
02:02:07,555 --> 02:02:13,075
You saved the prophet Jonah, who fell
into the sea, in the stomach of a fish.

1025
02:02:15,275 --> 02:02:17,915
You protected the prophet Muhammad

1026
02:02:19,035 --> 02:02:20,955
with spider webs.

1027
02:02:22,435 --> 02:02:25,035
We beg for your help
in all our hopelessness.

1028
02:02:26,715 --> 02:02:28,795
Please protect those

1029
02:02:29,475 --> 02:02:31,635
fighting for you,

1030
02:02:32,195 --> 02:02:34,395
and those following your cause.

1031
02:02:36,075 --> 02:02:38,635
Don't let them fall prey

1032
02:02:39,875 --> 02:02:42,315
to traps set up for them.

1033
02:02:43,195 --> 02:02:44,875
Only you can help,

1034
02:02:45,955 --> 02:02:47,275
and grant our wishes.

1035
02:02:48,435 --> 02:02:50,235
Grace us, God.

1036
02:02:51,115 --> 02:02:53,355
For the love of our holy prophet,

1037
02:02:54,515 --> 02:02:57,315
hear our prayers and grant us our wishes.

1038
02:02:58,115 --> 02:02:59,235
Hear us.

1039
02:02:59,635 --> 02:03:00,715
Hear us.

1040
02:03:01,955 --> 02:03:02,795
Amen.

1041
02:03:29,315 --> 02:03:30,155
Turgut.

1042
02:03:31,275 --> 02:03:32,715
Stay here, watch out back.

1043
02:03:34,155 --> 02:03:35,235
Yes, sir.

1044
02:04:18,995 --> 02:04:20,115
My dear.

1045
02:04:22,475 --> 02:04:23,675
Push.

1046
02:04:26,075 --> 02:04:27,475
The baby can't breathe.

1047
02:04:30,315 --> 02:04:31,555
Push, Halime Sultan.

1048
02:04:31,875 --> 02:04:32,995
Push.

1049
02:04:33,515 --> 02:04:34,835
Bear it, Sister.

1050
02:04:34,995 --> 02:04:36,435
Push.

1051
02:04:37,475 --> 02:04:38,555
Push, Sister.

1052
02:04:39,555 --> 02:04:40,555
Come on.

1053
02:04:40,715 --> 02:04:42,115
Come on, dear.

1054
02:04:44,035 --> 02:04:45,075
Sister.

1055
02:04:53,155 --> 02:04:54,435
Push, Sister.

1056
02:04:55,555 --> 02:04:56,675
It's about to come.

1057
02:04:56,875 --> 02:04:58,795
We must turn it over.

1058
02:05:01,995 --> 02:05:03,155
Come on, Halime Sultan.

1059
02:05:03,275 --> 02:05:04,355
Push.

1060
02:05:06,715 --> 02:05:08,075
Push, my dear.

1061
02:05:08,835 --> 02:05:10,595
Be strong now.

1062
02:05:11,035 --> 02:05:12,235
Think about your baby.

1063
02:05:13,195 --> 02:05:14,195
Come on.

1064
02:05:14,715 --> 02:05:18,075
Please God, don't take them away from us.

1065
02:05:18,435 --> 02:05:19,475
My dear.

1066
02:05:23,395 --> 02:05:24,995
No!

1067
02:05:25,115 --> 02:05:26,915
-Halime.
-Halime, my dear.

1068
02:05:27,435 --> 02:05:28,435
Halime.

1069
02:05:31,795 --> 02:05:33,035
My dear.

1070
02:05:33,435 --> 02:05:34,475
Halime.

1071
02:05:35,075 --> 02:05:36,315
Halime.

1072
02:05:37,915 --> 02:05:39,035
My dear.

1073
02:05:59,395 --> 02:06:02,235
Sir, he's dead.

1074
02:06:05,435 --> 02:06:06,555
No.

1075
02:06:07,355 --> 02:06:08,435
Can't be.

1076
02:06:12,075 --> 02:06:13,275
Sir.

1077
02:06:14,755 --> 02:06:16,275
How could they do this to you?

1078
02:06:21,355 --> 02:06:22,395
Vasilius.

1079
02:06:24,395 --> 02:06:26,435
They found him before us, Ertuğrul Bey.

1080
02:06:30,155 --> 02:06:31,595
This is a trap, Aliyar Bey.

1081
02:06:36,275 --> 02:06:37,475
A trap.

1082
02:07:33,715 --> 02:07:34,795
Men!

1083
02:07:35,195 --> 02:07:36,555
Get ready! It's a trap!

1084
02:08:27,315 --> 02:08:29,435
What are your orders, Your Highness?

1085
02:08:34,475 --> 02:08:35,475
Aliyar Bey.

1086
02:08:36,355 --> 02:08:38,035
Aliyar, Brother!

1087
02:08:42,595 --> 02:08:43,595
Wait.

1088
02:08:49,955 --> 02:08:52,395
Aliyar Bey! Wait, my brother.

1089
02:08:52,675 --> 02:08:54,155
We'll get out of here.

1090
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:05,235
Brother.

1091
02:09:59,395 --> 02:10:00,395
It's over now.

1092
02:10:06,995 --> 02:10:09,595
This is the end of your fame, Ertuğrul.

1093
02:10:10,555 --> 02:10:11,915
You can take all the fame.

1094
02:10:12,755 --> 02:10:14,475
Martyrdom will suffice for us.

1095
02:10:25,275 --> 02:10:29,555
Come on!
