1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 86 will start after 12:40 min.

2
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:15,902
Mother, are you okay?

3
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:22,982
Dündar didn't come to the wedding.

4
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:26,702
What else can I say?

5
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:57,902
Forgive me for what I've done.

6
00:15:48,222 --> 00:15:52,582
What has Bamsi Alp done?

7
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:57,502
He has set up his tent on the grass
under the sky!

8
00:15:57,942 --> 00:16:02,862
What has he done
to make his beloved happy?

9
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:08,782
He has made a stallion out of a horse,
a ram out of a sheep.

10
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:11,622
Did he break hearts?

11
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:16,302
Did he say anything wrong?

12
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:20,382
He didn't break a heart
or say anything wrong.

13
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,062
He got married instead!

14
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:26,942
Off the lovebirds go to the bridal tent
to conclude the marriage!

15
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:32,582
Then may God make them happy ever after!

16
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:34,782
Amen!

17
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:40,662
May God make you happy, brother.

18
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:44,102
Go, go, go!

19
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:21,382
Look at this, Bamsi.
It's like I'm in a dream.

20
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:28,102
They brought many gifts.
You could find anything here.

21
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:31,782
They sure did. That's how our tribe is.

22
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:35,222
Our bey on one side,
the people on the other.

23
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:40,342
They try to do the best they can.
It's our tradition.

24
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:45,542
And Lady Hafsa, settling down
is a prosperous thing.

25
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,902
Now tell me, do you need anything else?

26
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:54,502
Don't ask me if I need anything, Bamsi.

27
00:17:56,102 --> 00:18:01,022
Know that whatever makes you happy
makes me happy.

28
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:04,502
Whatever makes you cry, makes me cry.

29
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:13,022
How sweetly you talk, my beautiful.
My sweetheart.

30
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,822
And this is how marriage is, right?

31
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:20,822
Being one instead of two,
sharing the burdens and pleasures.

32
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:26,302
Our marriage has become a salve

33
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:29,942
for the pain of you and your loved ones.

34
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:32,502
You are right.

35
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:35,462
Our marriage is a beacon of hope
for the people.

36
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:39,222
And I finally get to be with my beloved.

37
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:41,422
What else can I ask of God?

38
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:45,542
Maybe you could ask for a baby, Bamsi?

39
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:50,542
Lady Hafsa, now....

40
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:54,022
Now this tent is our home,

41
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:57,822
let this bed be our heaven.

42
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:00,262
Amen.

43
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,782
Lady Hafsa, I need to say a prayer.

44
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:21,942
Don't go anywhere.

45
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:25,742
You wait here. I'll say a prayer.

46
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:22,462
Ertuğrul and Aliyar
will both be at the inn tonight

47
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,542
to ensure order.

48
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:30,062
Their absence will leave
the tribe vulnerable.

49
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:37,022
What about all the alps who obey Aliyar?

50
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:41,422
We will wait until they go out hunting
and then strike, Vasilius.

51
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,382
I'll send Aliyar's alps out hunting.

52
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:49,422
There will be no resistance.

53
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,502
Don't underestimate the tribe, Ural.

54
00:20:54,822 --> 00:20:58,902
Do you think they could accept someone
who they think of as a traitor?

55
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:05,902
The lives of the people
are precious to them.

56
00:21:08,262 --> 00:21:13,182
Once I've slayed a couple of rebels,

57
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:17,222
no person will even peek
through their tent.

58
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:19,582
They'll feel forced to obey me.

59
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:25,982
I hope you're right, Ural,
because this is your final move.

60
00:21:26,822 --> 00:21:29,262
Either you'll inhale
the breath of life, or...

61
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:32,062
you'll exhale your last.

62
00:21:32,342 --> 00:21:35,702
That makes two of us.

63
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:45,982
If you can't stop Ertuğrul with the help
of the Turkish leaders who support me,

64
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:48,782
it will end badly for both of us.

65
00:21:49,822 --> 00:21:53,062
I doubt the Turkish leaders' loyalties.

66
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:55,862
They are loyal to me.

67
00:21:56,702 --> 00:21:58,942
They'd be honored to back me up.

68
00:21:59,942 --> 00:22:05,982
Ural Bey<i>, </i>would anyone support you
if not for their own interests?

69
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:15,862
Go ahead, tell me.
What did you promise to them?

70
00:22:29,462 --> 00:22:32,382
Thank God we could
finally help Bamsi get married.

71
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:36,662
May God bless you, my bey<i>.</i>

72
00:22:38,622 --> 00:22:39,702
I appreciate it, Turgut.

73
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:43,302
The company of friends is
what make these events so beautiful.

74
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,462
May God bless you all.

75
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:47,742
Thank you, my bey<i>.</i>

76
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:49,742
<i>My bey, may I enter?</i>

77
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:53,062
Enter, Abdur Rahman.

78
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:02,862
The Turkmen leaders' messenger
is here, my bey<i>.</i>

79
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,302
Let him in, Abdur Rahman.

80
00:23:18,382 --> 00:23:19,382
<i>Selamunaleykum.</i>

81
00:23:19,502 --> 00:23:21,342
<i>-Aleykumselam</i>
<i>-Aleykumselam</i>

82
00:23:21,422 --> 00:23:24,102
I have a message
from the Turkish leaders, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

83
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:27,982
They want to conclude the council
that was interrupted.

84
00:23:28,502 --> 00:23:31,022
They wish for a council meeting
in the bazaar.

85
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,502
Aliyar Bey knows about it, too.
He will be there, my bey<i>.</i>

86
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:38,102
Thank you.

87
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:43,262
Let the Turkmen leaders know
that I'd be honored to host them.

88
00:23:57,822 --> 00:24:01,462
This is better, my bey.
We can finish what we've started.

89
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:09,062
Ensure you take
the necessary precautions anyway.

90
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:12,302
Have our alps guard
the paths the leaders take.

91
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:19,142
Vasilius is weak, but we will
take proper precautions anyway.

92
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:21,262
As you order, my bey<i>.</i>

93
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:31,102
Tell me, what did you promise to them?

94
00:24:32,742 --> 00:24:35,302
Freedom.

95
00:24:37,982 --> 00:24:40,422
They must decide

96
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:44,422
between following Ertuğrul's tail
or taking the lead themselves

97
00:24:45,742 --> 00:24:51,342
Do they know that they'll die
if they don't leave my lands

98
00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:52,942
once you have your tribe back?

99
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:55,742
Of course they do.

100
00:24:56,342 --> 00:24:57,582
I told them.

101
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:02,062
We'll take our tribes with us
and leave these lands.

102
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:05,582
We'll leave for richer,
more prosperous lands.

103
00:25:29,102 --> 00:25:31,502
These leaders are dumber than I thought.

104
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:38,302
I wouldn't do anything
that meant I had to leave the bazaar,

105
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:41,702
the gold mine or Karacahisar Castle.

106
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:49,422
You Turks have a great saying.
I learned it from Sadettin.

107
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:51,582
At this rate,
I'll become fluent in Turkish.

108
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,462
"Way to go!"

109
00:25:55,742 --> 00:25:59,822
Convincing them to leave
with empty hands is a tough thing to do.

110
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,142
Very tough.

111
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:06,102
What's most important for me is to get rid
of every descendant of Ertuğrul,

112
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:11,142
take over the Kayi tribe,
and then live in peace.

113
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:13,142
There is nothing more precious

114
00:26:13,302 --> 00:26:16,742
for me and the Turkmen leaders.

115
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:25,822
Me and my troops will be waiting for you
somewhere near the tribe.

116
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:30,502
I'll be the first
to celebrate your victory.

117
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:34,782
And if, not when, <i>if </i>you fail,

118
00:26:35,622 --> 00:26:40,822
I'll come to help you.

119
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:42,302
Don't worry.

120
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:46,702
Then let's secure victory.

121
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,022
Let's do it, Ural Bey. Let's do it.

122
00:26:52,942 --> 00:26:54,662
-Commander.
-Yes, sir.

123
00:26:55,182 --> 00:27:00,142
Be a good host to Lady Çolpan
until I return with Ural Bey<i>.</i>

124
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:05,342
My wife comes with me!

125
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:09,102
There will be bloodshed.
She might get hurt.

126
00:27:09,222 --> 00:27:11,142
It's best that she stays at the castle.

127
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:14,662
If we die, we die together.
I won't let her be a hostage here.

128
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:23,662
Not a hostage, Ural. A guest.

129
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:28,382
You'll be reunited with her
as soon as we achieve our victory.

130
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:32,142
This is better for both of us.

131
00:27:34,262 --> 00:27:35,222
Trust me.

132
00:27:52,182 --> 00:27:53,862
I'll miss this Turk.

133
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:57,582
No.

134
00:28:01,822 --> 00:28:05,302
Have Lady Çolpan killed
if she does anything wrong.

135
00:28:05,382 --> 00:28:06,542
Yes, sir.

136
00:28:30,862 --> 00:28:35,142
Mother... enough.

137
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:36,782
You've torn your heart out.

138
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:44,462
It brings me great pain whenever
I see trouble arise between my boys.

139
00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:49,222
May God deliver them from evil.

140
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,982
Mother, Dündar Bey is
an understanding man.

141
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:56,422
And Ertuğrul Bey wouldn't let any harm
come to his brother.

142
00:28:58,062 --> 00:29:00,702
He did this to teach Dündar Bey a lesson.

143
00:29:02,422 --> 00:29:06,662
He didn't come to the wedding,
and he's still not here now.

144
00:29:07,462 --> 00:29:12,862
I sent orders to check on his tent.
Still no news.

145
00:29:14,022 --> 00:29:16,342
I hope my fears won't come true.

146
00:29:20,782 --> 00:29:21,822
Hopefully.

147
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:34,062
May I come in, my bey<i>?</i>

148
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:35,862
Come in, Kutluca. Come.

149
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:50,302
My Aliyar Bey<i>, </i>I have something to say.

150
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:51,662
Go ahead.

151
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:55,462
For a long time now,
there have been black clouds over us.

152
00:29:56,742 --> 00:29:59,822
Our alps are sad.
I see it in their long faces.

153
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:05,542
I propose, if you so allow,
that we should go hunting tomorrow.

154
00:30:06,182 --> 00:30:08,622
Let the men fire arrows, swing swords.

155
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:12,982
What do you think, Kutluca?

156
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:18,182
The alps are on my mind, too, my bey,

157
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:21,382
but I couldn't let them leave
due to the current precautions.

158
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:27,542
Some of the alps can stay and guard
the inn while the rest go hunt, my bey<i>.</i>

159
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:30,542
And when the first hunters come back,
the rest can go hunt.

160
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:39,662
Very well. Kutluca, that is my decision.

161
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:43,382
As you see fit, my bey.

162
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:52,502
Guard.

163
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:03,942
My bey, the Tayi leader
appears to be with us.

164
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:05,822
The situation is good.

165
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:09,102
We'll see, Kutluca.

166
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:15,022
I am doubtful of his loyalty,
but what he says about the alps is true.

167
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:20,022
It is important to maintain the morale
of the alps as they fights these heathens.

168
00:31:21,022 --> 00:31:22,742
Hunting will give them courage.

169
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:27,702
Go and let them know. Tell them
to hunt quickly and come straight back.

170
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:30,142
Very well, my bey.

171
00:31:30,582 --> 00:31:32,942
-Kutluca.
-Yes, my bey.

172
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,782
Watch them closely.

173
00:31:37,102 --> 00:31:38,102
Yes, my bey.

174
00:31:44,982 --> 00:31:45,902
Guards.

175
00:32:15,222 --> 00:32:16,462
What's up, mother?

176
00:32:19,382 --> 00:32:21,262
You seem to be in pain.

177
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:27,862
Your brother's punishment
is too much, son.

178
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:31,902
Dündar is like a young tree.

179
00:32:33,262 --> 00:32:35,222
He can't be straightened up
if he is broken.

180
00:32:38,982 --> 00:32:44,022
My brother is the son of Suleyman Shah
and you, a strong mother.

181
00:32:45,182 --> 00:32:50,542
He will no doubt learn a lesson
from this shame.

182
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:53,902
Don't you worry.

183
00:32:55,102 --> 00:32:56,502
He is just a kid.

184
00:32:57,582 --> 00:33:00,702
In his innocence, he followed you
and believed whatever you said.

185
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:06,102
You practically brought him up.

186
00:33:09,982 --> 00:33:10,942
Mother...

187
00:33:13,262 --> 00:33:17,382
I'm trying to be both a brother
and a bey to Dündar.

188
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:21,542
I do whatever is the right thing to do.

189
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:28,702
I treat him just like I would treat
any of my alps in a situation like this.

190
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:32,942
I can't and won't discriminate.

191
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:37,862
I do what my father, Suleyman Shah,
taught me to do.

192
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:48,782
Ertuğrul, I've always been
at your side, son.

193
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:52,702
Don't let your brother drift away.

194
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:58,622
I want nothing but to see you
standing shoulder to shoulder as brothers.

195
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:01,062
<i>May I come in, my bey?</i>

196
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:02,702
Come in, Abdur Rahman.

197
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:13,502
My bey<i>, </i>people saw Dündar Bey
leave the tribe on his horse.

198
00:34:18,702 --> 00:34:19,942
Oh, Dündar!

199
00:34:21,582 --> 00:34:23,662
Oh, my son!

200
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:24,942
How could he do that?

201
00:34:25,582 --> 00:34:26,822
Where could he be going?

202
00:34:27,142 --> 00:34:29,222
Where would he go
at this time, Abdur Rahman?

203
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:30,622
I checked his tent, my bey<i>.</i>

204
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:33,502
He left this note.

205
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:56,422
Your tears will finally stop, my Çolpan.

206
00:34:57,142 --> 00:34:58,262
It's time to be happy.

207
00:34:58,982 --> 00:35:02,702
Now, happiness will be ours
and sadness theirs.

208
00:35:04,222 --> 00:35:05,702
I've always believed in you, my bey<i>.</i>

209
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:10,102
I knew that my Ural would punish those
who caused us pain.

210
00:35:10,502 --> 00:35:14,822
I believe we'll be welcomed as we deserve
when we get to the tribe tomorrow.

211
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:19,302
Those who separated us from our tribe
and tent will get what they deserve.

212
00:35:19,822 --> 00:35:21,342
But you won't be coming with me.

213
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:26,502
Once I take over the tribe,
I'll come here, not to retrieve you,

214
00:35:26,622 --> 00:35:30,422
but to kill Vasilius
and take over the castle.

215
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:37,422
And then, the scar in your heart
will finally be healed.

216
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:41,022
So soon? How is that going to happen?

217
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:44,742
The forces at the castle
are extremely weak right now.

218
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,542
Half of Vasilius' soldiers are dead.

219
00:35:47,222 --> 00:35:51,182
I'm the only one who can
enter the castle as an ally.

220
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:58,702
With the Turkmen leaders on my side,
it won't be hard to conquer this castle.

221
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:05,462
And then, you'll be treated as a queen,

222
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,422
both in here and in the tribe.

223
00:36:15,982 --> 00:36:18,382
Since we've been fighting for your cause

224
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,102
you've shown me that leadership
isn't about the sharpest sword,

225
00:36:22,782 --> 00:36:25,142
but about the highest wisdom,

226
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:28,942
and also that a good soldier isn't just
defined by their courage, but also faith.

227
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:34,062
But I've come to realize that I'm far away
from understanding these things.

228
00:36:35,702 --> 00:36:39,582
I did something irredeemable
and unforgivable.

229
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,262
I can't look you in the eye,

230
00:36:43,182 --> 00:36:45,742
nor can I look at Banu Çiçek,
whom I made a widow,

231
00:36:46,262 --> 00:36:50,182
or Doğan, whom I made an orphan.

232
00:36:54,502 --> 00:36:56,062
Give me your blessing.

233
00:36:56,942 --> 00:37:00,662
Look after my mother and the tribe.

234
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,342
Oh, my Dündar.

235
00:37:10,982 --> 00:37:12,462
Oh, my brave son.

236
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:18,502
Ertuğrul, if Dündar became a martyr,

237
00:37:19,142 --> 00:37:22,702
I'd shed tears of joy.

238
00:37:24,262 --> 00:37:27,982
But I can't stand losing him like this.

239
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:33,782
Do everything you can
to bring Dündar to me.

240
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:39,462
I won't be able to live with his absence.

241
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,902
Abdur Rahman, send alps after Dündar.

242
00:37:48,822 --> 00:37:51,342
Have them turn every stone if necessary.

243
00:37:52,862 --> 00:37:55,022
Tell them not to return
until Dündar has been found.

244
00:37:57,182 --> 00:37:58,182
As you order, my bey<i>.</i>

245
00:38:18,702 --> 00:38:19,982
<i>May I come in?</i>

246
00:38:20,902 --> 00:38:21,902
Come in, son.

247
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:26,062
Please, my bey.

248
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,062
Those who seek peace for their own gain
will lose that peace, son.

249
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,902
Peace is only given
to those who embrace one another.

250
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:56,822
Now, tell me:

251
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,422
what's the cause of your unrest?

252
00:39:03,782 --> 00:39:09,462
My brother Dündar left the tribe
while we were still grieving for Doğan.

253
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:14,342
My mother is deeply saddened
by the situation.

254
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:18,222
Important people
have important problems, son.

255
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:22,302
The weight of your responsibility
is heavy.

256
00:39:22,742 --> 00:39:27,022
You are not one of the people;
you are the one responsible for them.

257
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:34,862
You dealt this punishment
not for your own gain,

258
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:37,422
but because it was right.

259
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,862
You did it to uphold justice.

260
00:39:41,782 --> 00:39:43,022
You did the hard thing.

261
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:48,782
And your brother listened
to his conscience and left the tribe.

262
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:53,102
It's part of our religion to forgive
those who realize their faults.

263
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:58,102
When our prophet Muhammad...

264
00:40:00,262 --> 00:40:02,902
emigrated to Medina from Mecca,

265
00:40:03,422 --> 00:40:06,182
he declared that the immigrants
and the local people were brothers.

266
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:12,502
Every now and then,
there used to be...

267
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:15,662
some trouble between them.

268
00:40:16,742 --> 00:40:18,142
Mistakes were made.

269
00:40:19,102 --> 00:40:24,022
But they would ask for forgiveness
and try to compensate for their mistakes.

270
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:28,542
Hopefully, Dündar Bey will also

271
00:40:29,022 --> 00:40:31,462
compensate for his actions
in the best way possible.

272
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,942
The Lord Almighty says in al-Hujurat:

273
00:40:37,702 --> 00:40:40,182
"The believers are but brothers,

274
00:40:40,622 --> 00:40:43,382
so make settlement between them...

275
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:48,662
and fear God
so that you may receive mercy."

276
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:52,942
Ertuğrul, my son.

277
00:40:54,022 --> 00:40:57,342
Brothers are like rosary beads.

278
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:03,102
It's their leader who must align them...

279
00:41:07,062 --> 00:41:09,222
just like the head of the beads.

280
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:16,782
Now, what you should do is

281
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:20,022
embrace all your brothers
without discrimination.

282
00:41:20,902 --> 00:41:23,062
Humankind is just like dough.

283
00:41:23,262 --> 00:41:26,222
If you squeeze it too much,
it spills out of your hands

284
00:41:26,782 --> 00:41:28,062
and is wasted.

285
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:33,062
It's hard to be the responsible one,
the one who manages everything.

286
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:36,942
That's why the most just leaders

287
00:41:37,982 --> 00:41:39,862
enjoy the best gifts of all
in the afterlife.

288
00:41:40,742 --> 00:41:44,062
May God bless us with the brotherhood
of Muhammad's companions...

289
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:48,382
and may He remove the obstacles
between us.

290
00:41:50,142 --> 00:41:54,342
May He prevent those who try
to create problems from doing so.

291
00:41:55,062 --> 00:41:56,062
Amen.

292
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:57,302
Amen.

293
00:41:57,862 --> 00:41:58,782
Amen.

294
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:55,982
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

295
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:26,382
Stupid Dündar.

296
00:43:27,622 --> 00:43:28,742
Stupid Dündar.

297
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:33,222
You climbed the mountains
because of your pride.

298
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:38,982
But you can't eat pride.

299
00:43:41,142 --> 00:43:42,662
So I have to roll up my sleeves.

300
00:43:45,902 --> 00:43:47,182
So help me God.

301
00:43:48,142 --> 00:43:49,382
Let's see.

302
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,382
Our father in the skies...

303
00:44:20,862 --> 00:44:22,782
O Lord almighty.

304
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:25,382
May you reign over all.

305
00:44:26,862 --> 00:44:27,702
My God,

306
00:44:28,942 --> 00:44:32,182
may you bless us with victory.

307
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,582
It's time, my Çolpan.

308
00:44:48,262 --> 00:44:50,862
Ural, it was a terrible night.

309
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:53,622
I was having nightmares right up
until the morning.

310
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:58,102
It'll be the Kayi tribe
who have the nightmares now.

311
00:44:59,422 --> 00:45:00,382
Ural!

312
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:05,182
I saw you being killed
by a two-headed serpent.

313
00:45:07,222 --> 00:45:09,782
The same thing happened
when I lost my father.

314
00:45:11,702 --> 00:45:14,422
You had bad dreams because
you are full of fear, wife.

315
00:45:14,942 --> 00:45:16,422
Speak of good things, and they happen.

316
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:17,502
Come on.

317
00:45:50,062 --> 00:45:54,422
Commander, let the guards know that
no one is allowed to enter this castle.

318
00:45:56,182 --> 00:45:58,302
Lock all the doors.

319
00:45:58,982 --> 00:46:00,862
But sir, what about traders?

320
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:02,862
Let them wait till I come back!

321
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:08,542
Do not let any traders or even soldiers
enter the castle.

322
00:46:09,262 --> 00:46:13,462
Don't let anyone in until you see me.

323
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:15,662
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

324
00:46:29,262 --> 00:46:30,342
Ural.

325
00:46:31,062 --> 00:46:32,062
At last.

326
00:46:34,702 --> 00:46:36,422
So, it's your last day in my castle?

327
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,822
Not really, Vasilius.

328
00:46:40,782 --> 00:46:42,582
I'll come back for my wife.

329
00:46:43,222 --> 00:46:47,022
She is my responsibility. Don't worry.

330
00:46:49,622 --> 00:46:52,102
Thank you for everything, Vasilius.

331
00:46:52,702 --> 00:46:54,102
You have been a good host.

332
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,022
I've felt right at home.

333
00:46:57,662 --> 00:47:02,942
This is a home to anyone
who serves the empire.

334
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:06,182
My father served as well, Vasilius.

335
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,742
What a terrible fate, huh?

336
00:47:15,862 --> 00:47:17,182
I mean, that of your father.

337
00:47:17,982 --> 00:47:20,142
Some men's fates are written in pain.

338
00:47:20,942 --> 00:47:22,742
In that way, yours is like my father's.

339
00:47:25,622 --> 00:47:28,462
I know it affected you deeply
when Helena left.

340
00:47:40,582 --> 00:47:42,862
Helena's fate
is not intertwined with mine.

341
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:45,542
She will die, as she deserves.

342
00:47:46,302 --> 00:47:47,782
Just like your father.

343
00:48:02,262 --> 00:48:04,382
Çolpan, what do you think you are doing?

344
00:48:05,022 --> 00:48:05,982
Watch your tongue.

345
00:48:06,382 --> 00:48:09,982
I didn't say enough. I'm sick
of the way that bastard talks to me.

346
00:48:10,382 --> 00:48:13,382
I'm sick of playing nice
so as to not offend my father's killer.

347
00:48:13,822 --> 00:48:15,662
We are almost there.

348
00:48:16,142 --> 00:48:17,662
-Behave!
-Ural.

349
00:48:18,182 --> 00:48:19,262
I have had enough.

350
00:48:19,662 --> 00:48:23,102
I won't rest until I watch that bastard
die painfully.

351
00:48:23,502 --> 00:48:24,662
I'll kill him,

352
00:48:25,022 --> 00:48:26,902
either with your help or without it.

353
00:48:27,582 --> 00:48:31,342
This is not over yet.
We'll talk when I get back.

354
00:49:00,342 --> 00:49:03,662
Hafsa, you are as flawless as a calm sea.

355
00:49:04,782 --> 00:49:07,502
I could watch you day and night.

356
00:49:17,902 --> 00:49:20,422
I'm still trying to get used to my look.

357
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:26,222
I feel better in these clothes.

358
00:49:28,822 --> 00:49:30,702
I feel like I belonged here
from the beginning.

359
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:33,582
Right, Lady Hafsa.

360
00:49:34,102 --> 00:49:36,222
We all belong here.

361
00:49:36,742 --> 00:49:39,902
We belong to this soil,
this forest, this sky.

362
00:49:40,942 --> 00:49:42,062
Lady Hafsa...

363
00:49:43,582 --> 00:49:47,182
you weren't able to think clearly
in that castle.

364
00:49:48,462 --> 00:49:50,582
You weren't able to find God.

365
00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:55,982
All you found was darkness and intrigue.

366
00:49:58,942 --> 00:50:01,302
You've summarized my situation
very well, Bamsi.

367
00:50:02,742 --> 00:50:04,102
I felt unsettled there.

368
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:06,462
Every day was like a bad dream.

369
00:50:08,142 --> 00:50:11,982
I used to find it hard even to breathe.

370
00:50:13,742 --> 00:50:15,942
Oh, Lady Hafsa, you don't understand.

371
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:20,102
I wasn't able to breathe properly either.

372
00:50:20,462 --> 00:50:23,542
The heaven I was living in
had become a prison for me.

373
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:26,462
Brother Samsa.

374
00:50:28,102 --> 00:50:29,342
Why is he running like that?

375
00:50:29,782 --> 00:50:32,422
It as if there were a cat in his pants.

376
00:50:32,622 --> 00:50:34,582
Brother Samsa! Brother Samsa!

377
00:50:38,022 --> 00:50:39,262
-Brother.
-Yes, brother.

378
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:41,502
Where are you going in such a hurry?

379
00:50:41,822 --> 00:50:44,622
There is a council meeting at the inn.
We're heading there with our bey.

380
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:46,102
A Council meeting, you say?

381
00:50:47,142 --> 00:50:50,102
Things are not well, brother.
Dündar Bey left the tribe.

382
00:50:50,742 --> 00:50:52,742
Also, there is that issue.

383
00:50:53,142 --> 00:50:54,502
I pray to God all ends well.

384
00:50:54,622 --> 00:50:55,942
-Dündar Bey<i>, </i>you say?
-Yes.

385
00:50:56,102 --> 00:50:57,302
All this happened last night?

386
00:50:57,862 --> 00:51:00,262
-Yes.
-Good God. Good God.

387
00:51:00,502 --> 00:51:03,942
Come on, then. Let's go. Duty calls.

388
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,582
-Come on.
-Let's go.

389
00:51:06,062 --> 00:51:08,582
Forgive me, Lady Hafsa.

390
00:51:08,822 --> 00:51:09,742
I have to go.

391
00:51:10,422 --> 00:51:13,582
Of course, Bamsi. Go.
Don't leave Ertuğrul Bey alone.

392
00:51:13,942 --> 00:51:14,862
Good.

393
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:17,382
You take this.

394
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,982
Good. You are an angel. An angel.
Alright then.

395
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:35,062
<i>Our path is not that of the weak,</i>
<i>but of the brave.</i>

396
00:51:36,422 --> 00:51:37,502
You are my brother,

397
00:51:37,902 --> 00:51:41,062
but from now on,
you are neither a bey of this tribe...

398
00:51:42,662 --> 00:51:43,622
{\an8}nor an alp<i>.</i>

399
00:51:50,477 --> 00:51:53,397
-May I come in, Mother?
-Come in, son.

400
00:52:25,357 --> 00:52:28,917
Mother... I know.

401
00:52:29,957 --> 00:52:32,557
I know that you're deeply saddened
by what's happening with Dündar.

402
00:52:34,877 --> 00:52:38,717
It breaks my heart
to see you in so much pain.

403
00:52:42,757 --> 00:52:47,757
Dündar is not only your son,
he's also my brother.

404
00:52:51,757 --> 00:52:54,637
I can't bear the thought
of losing another brother.

405
00:53:00,117 --> 00:53:02,237
Let's give him some time for now.

406
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,237
Give him a chance to come around.

407
00:53:06,557 --> 00:53:07,877
Dündar isn't stupid.

408
00:53:09,317 --> 00:53:12,237
He'll come back to his tribe,
sooner or later.

409
00:53:18,357 --> 00:53:19,677
And if he doesn't?

410
00:53:22,757 --> 00:53:25,157
What if he gets lost in no man's land?

411
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:30,437
Dündar Bey is a bey of this tribe, Mother.

412
00:53:32,397 --> 00:53:34,797
I could no more
be separated from my brother

413
00:53:35,117 --> 00:53:37,597
than fingers from fingernails.

414
00:53:39,637 --> 00:53:42,077
This is the promise
of the son of Suleyman Shah.

415
00:53:43,157 --> 00:53:46,877
I'll bring Dündar back.
You must stay strong.

416
00:53:48,757 --> 00:53:51,917
I hope so, son. I hope so.

417
00:53:56,157 --> 00:53:58,157
My brother is like an arrow...

418
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,197
released from a bow.

419
00:54:04,077 --> 00:54:07,677
He'll find his way back to his tribe.

420
00:54:10,637 --> 00:54:12,037
Be strong.

421
00:54:15,757 --> 00:54:16,917
I hope so.

422
00:54:20,077 --> 00:54:21,437
Excuse me, Mother.

423
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:52,917
Let's go, alps!

424
00:54:55,437 --> 00:54:58,197
My Bey! My Bey!

425
00:54:59,717 --> 00:55:00,717
My Bey!

426
00:55:01,837 --> 00:55:02,877
My Bey!

427
00:55:03,837 --> 00:55:05,277
Where are you going without me?

428
00:55:06,317 --> 00:55:10,157
You just got married, Bamsi.
Spend some time with your wife.

429
00:55:14,877 --> 00:55:16,757
You deserve to, after all.

430
00:55:16,997 --> 00:55:18,597
Now, I can't have that, my bey<i>.</i>

431
00:55:18,757 --> 00:55:23,117
How can I relax while Dündar Bey
is missing and there's a council meeting?

432
00:55:23,357 --> 00:55:25,797
We can rest when
we're in our graves, my bey<i>.</i>

433
00:55:29,237 --> 00:55:31,197
-Very well, brother.
-Thank you, my bey<i>.</i>

434
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:34,117
Let's go, alps!

435
00:55:46,117 --> 00:55:48,397
-Let's go!
-Come on!

436
00:56:12,797 --> 00:56:16,757
Hafsa Hatun, what's going on?
Is there a problem?

437
00:56:17,797 --> 00:56:20,717
-Where is Bamsi?
-There's no problem, Halime Hatun.

438
00:56:21,157 --> 00:56:23,837
Bamsi has gone
to the inn with Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

439
00:56:24,037 --> 00:56:25,557
And I was waiting for you here.

440
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:31,957
Mother, you don't have to go
to the rug house today, we can handle it.

441
00:56:32,717 --> 00:56:34,197
That wouldn't be appropriate, daughter.

442
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:38,517
Many mothers have lost their children
in war, yet they still do their chores.

443
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:39,997
How can I not do mine?

444
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:44,517
What are you doing here, my girl?
Go to your tent and rest.

445
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:48,437
Mother Hayme, I'd like
to go to the rug house

446
00:56:48,557 --> 00:56:50,757
and work with the other women,
if you'll let me.

447
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:55,277
Now that I'm a woman of this tribe,
I need to work and contribute,

448
00:56:55,357 --> 00:56:56,317
isn't that right?

449
00:56:57,517 --> 00:56:59,837
-Whatever you want, my girl.
-Come.

450
00:57:00,357 --> 00:57:03,477
-I'll teach you how to do it.
-That would be great.

451
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,797
If you have a problem,
you know where I am.

452
00:57:26,157 --> 00:57:27,237
Excuse me.

453
00:57:30,037 --> 00:57:31,357
Banu Çiçek Hatun?

454
00:57:36,997 --> 00:57:40,317
When the time comes,
and our tribes go their separate ways,

455
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,437
where will I find you?

456
00:57:47,517 --> 00:57:50,757
Know that...
you'll be always in my heart.

457
00:57:53,877 --> 00:57:55,077
Doğan Alp<i>.</i>

458
00:58:10,277 --> 00:58:11,437
My boy...

459
00:58:15,077 --> 00:58:16,837
It is only you and me.

460
00:58:18,397 --> 00:58:20,037
Everyone went their own way.

461
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:27,397
You are the only thing
that keeps me going now.

462
00:58:33,717 --> 00:58:35,837
Every morsel I eat,

463
00:58:37,837 --> 00:58:41,077
every breath I take, is for you.

464
00:58:45,117 --> 00:58:46,997
You are my Doğan's gift to me.

465
00:59:05,757 --> 00:59:06,917
It's all right.

466
00:59:10,237 --> 00:59:11,437
It's all right.

467
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:19,157
No, I won't lose you too.

468
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:22,877
You'll be born.

469
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,037
You'll be my Doğan.

470
00:59:30,717 --> 00:59:33,357
You'll complete whatever your father...

471
00:59:35,077 --> 00:59:36,757
left incomplete.

472
01:00:15,117 --> 01:00:16,277
Dündar!

473
01:00:17,277 --> 01:00:19,277
You're paying the price
for your mistake now!

474
01:00:24,557 --> 01:00:29,317
You have neither a tribe
nor a home to go back to.

475
01:00:30,437 --> 01:00:32,397
You left your mother in tears.

476
01:00:34,437 --> 01:00:35,877
You are no good to anyone.

477
01:01:32,117 --> 01:01:36,637
So, Ural Bey, you are finally
going back to your tribe?

478
01:01:38,117 --> 01:01:43,997
I've missed the earth, the weather,
the water of this place, so much.

479
01:01:45,997 --> 01:01:47,037
But...

480
01:01:49,677 --> 01:01:52,277
I've missed the taste of victory
even more, Vasilius.

481
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,477
Those bastards!

482
01:02:04,797 --> 01:02:06,277
They're heading to the Cavdar Tribe.

483
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:58,237
These are blessed days, my bey<i>.</i>

484
01:03:03,437 --> 01:03:06,557
Alps! Good hunting!

485
01:03:07,877 --> 01:03:11,037
Relax. Have fun.

486
01:03:12,197 --> 01:03:16,517
But, when you get back to the tribe,

487
01:03:17,197 --> 01:03:19,397
I want you all alert and ready.

488
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:23,597
-Understood?
-Yes, Bey.

489
01:03:26,717 --> 01:03:27,677
Go on, then.

490
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:56,237
You're responsible for security.

491
01:03:56,877 --> 01:03:59,917
Don't worry, my bey.
I'll take good care of the tribe.

492
01:04:00,597 --> 01:04:01,677
Remember,

493
01:04:03,037 --> 01:04:06,757
too much or too little
of anything will ruin everything.

494
01:04:08,517 --> 01:04:11,037
Run away from those two
as if you were running from lions.

495
01:04:12,277 --> 01:04:14,117
Act decisively and appropriately.

496
01:04:15,717 --> 01:04:18,397
Yes, my bey. Thank you.

497
01:04:36,037 --> 01:04:36,997
Come on!

498
01:04:44,437 --> 01:04:46,397
Send a messenger to Cayiralan immediately.

499
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:51,837
Tell Ural Bey that Aliyar has gone
and the operation can begin.

500
01:04:52,557 --> 01:04:53,437
Yes, my bey<i>.</i>

501
01:05:57,917 --> 01:05:59,237
I smell blood.

502
01:06:00,877 --> 01:06:02,397
There's a smell of blood in the air.

503
01:06:03,477 --> 01:06:05,877
That is the smell
of my enemies, Vasilius.

504
01:06:06,437 --> 01:06:07,957
It is the smell of revenge.

505
01:06:10,757 --> 01:06:13,277
Are you certain you want to go
to your tribe without me?

506
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:15,437
I could make things easier for you.

507
01:06:16,157 --> 01:06:17,557
Not now, Vasilius.

508
01:06:18,197 --> 01:06:21,397
They won't obey me
if they see you with me.

509
01:06:22,557 --> 01:06:25,117
And afterwards? They'll see me then.

510
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:32,117
By then I'll be the leader of the tribe.

511
01:06:32,917 --> 01:06:36,677
And maintaining good
relations with my neighbors

512
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:38,757
will be expected of me.

513
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:44,157
You are good at politics.

514
01:06:44,597 --> 01:06:46,837
You've learned a great
deal from Emir Sadettin.

515
01:06:47,277 --> 01:06:48,317
So I have.

516
01:06:49,157 --> 01:06:51,597
But there's one thing he'll learn from me.

517
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:55,597
Everyone pays for their misdeeds.

518
01:07:08,437 --> 01:07:09,637
Let him pass.

519
01:07:17,717 --> 01:07:18,757
Welcome, my bey<i>.</i>

520
01:07:19,277 --> 01:07:21,877
Thank you. So, where are we?

521
01:07:22,197 --> 01:07:25,717
All is well, my bey<i>.</i>
Aliyar Bey went to the inn with the alps<i>.</i>

522
01:07:28,117 --> 01:07:31,077
What about my men?
What about my alps?

523
01:07:31,317 --> 01:07:32,797
They are ready and waiting for you.

524
01:07:32,997 --> 01:07:34,037
Do we have a secure route?

525
01:07:34,277 --> 01:07:36,917
Our alps are standing guard
at the back entrance to the camp.

526
01:07:37,077 --> 01:07:38,397
No one will stop you, my bey<i>.</i>

527
01:07:39,717 --> 01:07:42,557
The time has come.
Let the coup begin.

528
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:46,517
We've waited so long.
But it'll be worth it.

529
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,197
At last, Ural.

530
01:07:50,437 --> 01:07:53,877
At last, everyone will get
what they deserve.

531
01:08:16,997 --> 01:08:20,237
-My Bey<i>.</i>
-Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

532
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:28,597
-Welcome, my bey<i>.</i>
-Thank you, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

533
01:08:30,117 --> 01:08:31,157
When did you arrive?

534
01:08:31,517 --> 01:08:34,357
Just now, bey<i>.</i>
I came straight to the inn.

535
01:08:34,597 --> 01:08:38,077
I decided to wait for you,
since there's a meeting.

536
01:08:38,397 --> 01:08:40,957
Well done. What's the situation?

537
01:08:41,597 --> 01:08:44,477
I have some important
news for you, my bey.

538
01:08:44,717 --> 01:08:47,037
But it can wait until
after the council meeting.

539
01:08:48,637 --> 01:08:49,917
Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

540
01:08:50,237 --> 01:08:52,717
Thank you, Aleko. Thank you.

541
01:08:54,117 --> 01:08:56,357
Let's talk while we're waiting
for the other beys<i>, </i>Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

542
01:08:56,997 --> 01:08:58,797
I want to hear what's on your mind.

543
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:02,317
My bey, all the other beys are here.
They're waiting for you.

544
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:09,157
They're here already?

545
01:09:09,717 --> 01:09:12,637
Exactly, my bey. I was surprised, too.

546
01:09:13,117 --> 01:09:14,837
They've never arrived so early.

547
01:09:16,517 --> 01:09:19,357
Well, then. Let's meet them.

548
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:20,957
This way, my bey<i>.</i>

549
01:09:47,957 --> 01:09:51,317
Keep an eye on the tribe.
Let me know of anyone who comes and goes.

550
01:09:51,717 --> 01:09:53,357
Yes, commander.

551
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:29,997
<i>He's here.</i>

552
01:10:34,717 --> 01:10:38,837
-My beys.
-Welcome, my bey. We're honored.

553
01:10:39,877 --> 01:10:43,477
-The time has come. Is everything ready?
-Just as you ordered.

554
01:10:43,677 --> 01:10:45,957
The swords in the training field
have all been seized.

555
01:10:46,677 --> 01:10:49,797
Our alps are at their posts,
waiting for the signal.

556
01:10:50,077 --> 01:10:51,357
What about Aliyar's men?

557
01:10:51,677 --> 01:10:54,877
We've lured them into a trap.
They've gathered in the tent.

558
01:10:56,037 --> 01:10:59,277
Good. Let's not keep them waiting, huh?

559
01:11:00,477 --> 01:11:01,477
Let's go.

560
01:11:08,997 --> 01:11:12,117
Turkish rugs are known
the world over, due to their tightness

561
01:11:12,277 --> 01:11:14,557
and the vividness of their colors.

562
01:11:15,637 --> 01:11:17,677
You must knot it in such a way

563
01:11:17,797 --> 01:11:21,077
that it's as tough as armor
when it's finished.

564
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:24,077
But be careful with the patterns.

565
01:11:25,637 --> 01:11:31,477
Now, knot five times to the right
and five times to the left.

566
01:11:32,477 --> 01:11:33,557
Like this.

567
01:11:43,357 --> 01:11:44,717
Come on, you try now.

568
01:11:45,397 --> 01:11:47,357
-Thank you, Halime.
-In the name of God.

569
01:11:59,157 --> 01:12:02,277
If you knot them with your love
nothing will tear your rug.

570
01:12:03,597 --> 01:12:05,237
Thank you, Halime Hatun.

571
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:10,917
Take the one from the back.

572
01:12:15,117 --> 01:12:16,917
You have skillful hands, Hafsa.

573
01:12:27,957 --> 01:12:29,597
You go on, take your time.

574
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,037
Mother.

575
01:12:43,877 --> 01:12:45,797
I know you're thinking about Dündar Bey.

576
01:12:48,037 --> 01:12:50,197
But you must pull
yourself together, Mother.

577
01:12:51,557 --> 01:12:53,717
I don't want to see you in so much pain.

578
01:12:54,797 --> 01:12:56,597
Neither would Dündar Bey<i>.</i>

579
01:12:56,997 --> 01:13:00,477
I'm telling you, he'll be back soon.

580
01:13:05,637 --> 01:13:06,837
Being a mother

581
01:13:08,397 --> 01:13:12,117
is like sipping at sour milk, my girl.

582
01:13:15,237 --> 01:13:18,757
I hope you never experience
the sort of pain I'm suffering.

583
01:13:26,117 --> 01:13:27,797
Mother, Aslıhan Hatun is coming.

584
01:13:28,717 --> 01:13:31,277
Aslıhan Hatun! Welcome!

585
01:13:31,797 --> 01:13:33,077
Thank God.

586
01:13:34,717 --> 01:13:35,877
Thank God.

587
01:13:37,517 --> 01:13:39,677
-I'm so happy to see you here.
-Welcome.

588
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:41,517
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

589
01:13:42,037 --> 01:13:43,917
-Mother.
-Welcome, my girl.

590
01:13:45,757 --> 01:13:46,957
Thank you.

591
01:13:48,997 --> 01:13:51,277
-Welcome, Aslıhan Hatun.
-Thank you.

592
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:53,597
-Welcome.
-Welcome, Aslıhan Hatun.

593
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:55,717
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

594
01:13:55,917 --> 01:13:58,037
I've missed you and my home so much.

595
01:13:58,317 --> 01:13:59,917
We missed you, too.

596
01:14:00,917 --> 01:14:02,277
Bring some yogurt for her.

597
01:14:02,517 --> 01:14:04,797
Come and take a seat.
You've come a long way.

598
01:14:10,797 --> 01:14:12,077
Thank you.

599
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:39,797
Go ahead.

600
01:14:45,117 --> 01:14:47,237
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

601
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:53,957
With the 99 names of Allah
who protects and forgives.

602
01:14:56,437 --> 01:14:57,677
Amen.

603
01:14:59,637 --> 01:15:02,517
May our council cause greater good.

604
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:04,997
-Amen.
-Amen.

605
01:15:06,637 --> 01:15:12,077
The council is honored to host
the leaders of the Turkmen tribes.

606
01:15:12,437 --> 01:15:14,197
Thank you, my bey.

607
01:15:24,237 --> 01:15:26,677
Honorable beys of the Turkmen tribes.

608
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:30,837
We are ready to implement
the Sultan's orders.

609
01:15:31,317 --> 01:15:33,757
There are no more obstacles in our way.

610
01:15:34,557 --> 01:15:37,277
Vasilius may have wanted
to prevent us from going ahead,

611
01:15:37,757 --> 01:15:39,837
but he has now tasted
the bitterness of defeat.

612
01:15:40,197 --> 01:15:43,597
We heard about your victories,
Ertuğrul Bey<i>. </i>You've made us proud.

613
01:15:45,277 --> 01:15:48,757
You hanged his commanders at his castle.
You made us all proud.

614
01:15:49,437 --> 01:15:52,397
You took revenge on those bastards
who murdered my father.

615
01:15:52,797 --> 01:15:55,517
My tribe and I will
always be at your side.

616
01:15:56,637 --> 01:16:00,797
Your father is an honorable martyr,
who died on the way to the meeting.

617
01:16:01,877 --> 01:16:05,077
It is now your duty to wave his flag.

618
01:16:07,037 --> 01:16:12,037
Vasilius paid a heavy price.
He can't do any more harm to you now.

619
01:16:13,077 --> 01:16:15,037
I hope it is as you say.

620
01:16:15,197 --> 01:16:19,277
A thug like Vasilius won't just sit
in his castle and wait for death.

621
01:16:21,357 --> 01:16:23,517
We don't intend to leave him waiting long.

622
01:16:25,637 --> 01:16:29,837
Neither Vasilius, nor Ural
who took refuge in his castle,

623
01:16:30,437 --> 01:16:32,957
can prevent us uniting.

624
01:16:39,797 --> 01:16:40,797
May I?

625
01:16:45,597 --> 01:16:46,517
Dündar?

626
01:16:48,077 --> 01:16:49,837
Where have you been, brother?
What is this?

627
01:16:50,157 --> 01:16:51,517
We have a problem, brother.

628
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:56,277
Ural and Vasilius are heading
towards the Cavdar Tribe with soldiers.

629
01:17:07,717 --> 01:17:09,077
What about you, Dündar?

630
01:17:27,957 --> 01:17:29,397
Let us through, alps<i>.</i>

631
01:17:39,837 --> 01:17:42,317
-Who are you?
-The leader of Cavdars.

632
01:17:46,357 --> 01:17:47,317
Ural Bey<i>.</i>

633
01:17:48,517 --> 01:17:49,637
Traitor!

634
01:17:50,357 --> 01:17:51,277
Kutluca!

635
01:17:57,957 --> 01:18:01,317
Don't worry, he'll die too.

636
01:18:12,877 --> 01:18:13,837
Kutluca Alp!

637
01:18:14,397 --> 01:18:17,637
Two alps and a hooded man
just went into Kayitmaz Bey's tent.

638
01:18:18,037 --> 01:18:19,157
They looked like trouble.

639
01:18:19,957 --> 01:18:22,637
This is not good at all.
Let's get over there now.

640
01:18:26,797 --> 01:18:29,957
What's going on here? Ural doesn't
have anything to do with Vasilius.

641
01:18:32,197 --> 01:18:33,717
Something stinks here.

642
01:18:34,237 --> 01:18:36,637
Ural is taking advantage of my absence

643
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:39,837
to attack me with that bastard Vasilius,
Ertuğrul Bey.

644
01:18:41,517 --> 01:18:44,837
How could they have known
you'd be here, Aliyar Bey?

645
01:18:45,237 --> 01:18:46,757
Council meetings are held in secret.

646
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:52,597
This meeting is just part of Ural's game.

647
01:18:54,637 --> 01:18:57,837
How come?
What do you mean, Ertuğrul Bey?

648
01:18:58,397 --> 01:19:01,917
There are traitors here among us
who have collaborated with Ural.

649
01:19:04,237 --> 01:19:05,717
Who are they, Ertuğrul Bey?

650
01:19:06,517 --> 01:19:09,997
Your words affect all of us.
If you know something, speak.

651
01:19:12,477 --> 01:19:14,757
It's obvious who they are.

652
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:23,877
Samsa.

653
01:19:42,837 --> 01:19:44,437
We haven't done anything, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

654
01:19:46,957 --> 01:19:48,237
Stop! Stop!

655
01:19:48,597 --> 01:19:50,317
Stop! What are you doing? Stop!

656
01:19:51,157 --> 01:19:52,597
We are innocent, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

657
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,437
It's all lies, Ertuğrul Bey.

658
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:57,997
We didn't do anything, release us.

659
01:19:58,157 --> 01:20:00,557
-We're innocent, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>
-Stop! What are you doing?

660
01:20:01,957 --> 01:20:05,997
We didn't do anything, Ertuğrul Bey.
This is a slander! A slander!

661
01:20:07,197 --> 01:20:10,197
Forgive us, my bey<i>.</i>
We made a mistake. Forgive us, my bey<i>.</i>

662
01:20:15,397 --> 01:20:17,997
Spare our lives
and we'll tell you everything we know.

663
01:20:18,317 --> 01:20:20,237
You'll be telling it to God.

664
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:43,957
This is that bastard Ural's last day.

665
01:20:45,237 --> 01:20:47,477
He will not deceive anyone ever again.

666
01:20:47,877 --> 01:20:51,317
My people are in danger, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>
What are we going to do?

667
01:20:51,877 --> 01:20:53,677
Ural will have taken precautions.

668
01:20:55,237 --> 01:20:59,037
So we'll be cautious, too.
Now, listen to me carefully.

669
01:21:27,597 --> 01:21:29,157
Bastards!

670
01:21:29,797 --> 01:21:33,277
I won't let you get
away with this. I won’t!

671
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,077
Go to the inn right away
and tell Aliyar Bey what's happened.

672
01:21:38,397 --> 01:21:41,597
Tell him his beys have been murdered
and that he must come back immediately.

673
01:21:41,677 --> 01:21:42,997
Yes, commander.

674
01:21:43,117 --> 01:21:45,357
Don't let anyone see you,
use a hidden path. Go on!

675
01:21:45,477 --> 01:21:47,277
-Don't worry, sir.
-Go!

676
01:22:01,077 --> 01:22:02,477
What's wrong, Urkmez Bey<i>?</i>

677
01:22:02,797 --> 01:22:06,317
Something's going on. I just saw
Kutluca Alp running to the training field.

678
01:22:06,957 --> 01:22:09,397
-I shouted, but he didn't hear.
-What are you saying, Urkmez Bey<i>?</i>

679
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:13,197
Enjoying your meal, beys?

680
01:22:16,397 --> 01:22:17,437
Ural Bey!

681
01:22:21,277 --> 01:22:24,677
Well, you've had your fill.
Now it's my turn.

682
01:22:45,037 --> 01:22:48,077
So, revenge actually is sweet.

683
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:58,157
Ural Bey<i>, </i>everything is ready
at the training field.

684
01:22:58,677 --> 01:23:01,597
Good. The traitorous beys are dead.

685
01:23:02,197 --> 01:23:05,037
Now it's the turn
of those traitorous alps.

686
01:23:07,077 --> 01:23:09,397
Go to the rug house. You know what to do.

687
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:30,077
Very good. You've finished the job.
God bless your hands.

688
01:23:32,277 --> 01:23:33,557
Thank God it's done.

689
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:37,037
The women will align the rugs
before they're delivered to the Franks.

690
01:23:38,797 --> 01:23:41,717
I'm so happy you married
Bamsi, Hafsa Hatun.

691
01:23:42,277 --> 01:23:44,437
Your name is as beautiful
as your face and heart.

692
01:23:45,117 --> 01:23:46,757
Thank you, Aslıhan Hatun.

693
01:23:47,557 --> 01:23:50,237
As you say, now it's your turn.

694
01:23:51,077 --> 01:23:52,157
Amen.

695
01:23:56,837 --> 01:23:58,277
How are you, my girl?

696
01:23:59,197 --> 01:24:02,077
Was everything all right on your trip?

697
01:24:03,397 --> 01:24:04,357
I'm fine, mother.

698
01:24:05,277 --> 01:24:08,917
I met Emir Sadettin's mother
while I was there.

699
01:24:09,557 --> 01:24:13,797
She liked me, and I liked her.
I left there with good memories.

700
01:24:16,957 --> 01:24:21,037
That's what your tongue says,
but your eyes say otherwise.

701
01:24:22,197 --> 01:24:26,677
I hope there weren't any difficulties.
We weren't expecting you back so soon.

702
01:24:28,637 --> 01:24:30,757
I felt homesick, Mother.

703
01:24:31,757 --> 01:24:33,597
Whenever I went outside

704
01:24:34,357 --> 01:24:38,797
all I wanted was to see
the land of my home and my tribe.

705
01:24:39,637 --> 01:24:42,077
I missed it so much. So, I came back.

706
01:24:44,717 --> 01:24:46,597
There's nowhere quite like home.

707
01:24:48,197 --> 01:24:52,357
But as time goes by, you'll feel your home
is by your beloved one's side.

708
01:24:53,717 --> 01:24:55,957
This is the land of my birth,
Halime Hatun.

709
01:24:56,637 --> 01:24:58,717
That can never change.

710
01:24:59,157 --> 01:25:01,117
People can be only sure of their home.

711
01:25:32,677 --> 01:25:33,997
Brave Turkmen beys<i>.</i>

712
01:25:36,717 --> 01:25:38,317
You know what to do.

713
01:25:39,237 --> 01:25:42,517
We do, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>
There's no turning back from this path.

714
01:25:45,397 --> 01:25:47,317
May God help us, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

715
01:25:48,197 --> 01:25:50,677
-Amen.
-Thank you, Aliyar Bey<i>.</i>

716
01:25:51,557 --> 01:25:56,037
We either put an end to this wickedness
or we become martyrs together.

717
01:25:58,877 --> 01:26:00,397
-Artuk Bey.
-Yes, my bey<i>.</i>

718
01:26:00,677 --> 01:26:03,557
-You'll come with us.
-Yes, my bey.

719
01:26:04,077 --> 01:26:07,277
I've missed the sound of my sword.
Now it'll be music to my ears.

720
01:26:10,357 --> 01:26:12,997
-May God help us.
-Amen.

721
01:26:31,477 --> 01:26:35,197
Come on, my girl. You've only just
arrived. You should be resting.

722
01:26:35,797 --> 01:26:37,237
We can handle this.

723
01:26:37,837 --> 01:26:42,397
I've been resting for a long time, Mother.
I've missed working. Let me help.

724
01:26:43,877 --> 01:26:45,357
As you wish.

725
01:26:46,357 --> 01:26:50,717
You are precious to us.
Your wellbeing is important.

726
01:26:51,557 --> 01:26:53,877
-Take good care of yourself.
-Thank you.

727
01:26:56,117 --> 01:27:00,357
Halime Hatun.
Why are those alps staring at us?

728
01:27:06,437 --> 01:27:08,357
It looks like they have a problem, Hafsa.

729
01:27:09,237 --> 01:27:10,397
Mother.

730
01:27:16,437 --> 01:27:18,557
Mother Hayme, what's going on?

731
01:27:45,957 --> 01:27:48,317
It's obvious what's going on. Treachery!

732
01:27:49,037 --> 01:27:51,997
Ladies, brave ladies.

733
01:27:53,517 --> 01:27:57,317
We face treachery. On your guard!

734
01:28:03,477 --> 01:28:06,357
Women of Kayi. You will come with us.

735
01:28:06,997 --> 01:28:08,117
What's your problem?

736
01:28:09,077 --> 01:28:12,517
What do you think you're doing,
pointing your swords at women?

737
01:28:12,797 --> 01:28:13,957
Do as I say.

738
01:28:14,117 --> 01:28:16,677
What are you talking about? Stay back!

739
01:28:16,877 --> 01:28:18,357
Be on your way, go on!

740
01:28:18,557 --> 01:28:20,517
You'll do as we say if you want to live.

741
01:28:20,637 --> 01:28:22,397
No mercy will be shown
to those who resist.

742
01:28:22,677 --> 01:28:25,317
Very well, come on then.

743
01:28:25,477 --> 01:28:26,837
Halime, Aslıhan!

744
01:28:28,437 --> 01:28:29,517
Stop, girls.

745
01:28:30,117 --> 01:28:32,757
Whose dogs are you?

746
01:28:33,957 --> 01:28:35,037
Tell me.

747
01:28:37,317 --> 01:28:41,797
Who made you so shameless
that you would point your swords at women?

748
01:28:42,237 --> 01:28:45,157
This is Ural's doing, Mother.
It's obvious.

749
01:28:46,117 --> 01:28:49,797
These are Ural Bey's orders<i>.</i>
Give up your daggers and surrender.

750
01:28:55,677 --> 01:28:57,117
You traitors.

751
01:29:04,117 --> 01:29:05,437
You pig!

752
01:29:08,997 --> 01:29:12,197
Did you really think you could
get away with this, you bastards?

753
01:29:12,397 --> 01:29:13,797
Let me go! Mother!

754
01:29:13,917 --> 01:29:15,357
-Let her go.
-Let her go!

755
01:29:15,557 --> 01:29:17,117
Drop your weapons or I'll kill her.

756
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:18,637
Aslıhan, my girl.

757
01:29:26,357 --> 01:29:27,477
Mother.

758
01:29:31,877 --> 01:29:33,197
Are we going to surrender, Mother?

759
01:29:35,077 --> 01:29:35,917
Ladies.

760
01:29:54,757 --> 01:29:56,997
We'll wait for Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

761
01:29:57,717 --> 01:30:00,317
Take them prisoner.
Take them to the tent and tie them up.

762
01:30:00,597 --> 01:30:01,637
Let go!

763
01:30:03,397 --> 01:30:05,357
Shame on you.

764
01:30:05,477 --> 01:30:07,757
Shame on you.

765
01:30:22,157 --> 01:30:24,317
We need to find Ural.
Let the other alps know.

766
01:30:24,437 --> 01:30:26,077
As you command, Kutluca Alp.

767
01:30:42,277 --> 01:30:43,717
Looking for me, Kutluca?

768
01:30:45,197 --> 01:30:46,397
You bastard!

769
01:30:53,037 --> 01:30:58,117
Traitors! Filth!
You'll get what you deserve.

770
01:30:58,477 --> 01:31:01,717
I've brought what you deserve, Kutluca.

771
01:31:05,917 --> 01:31:07,677
This one's mine. Come.

772
01:31:26,717 --> 01:31:29,397
What happened, Kutluca?
You're on your knees.

773
01:31:31,637 --> 01:31:35,357
I told you. You should've listened to me.

774
01:31:42,277 --> 01:31:43,917
You've killed your brothers.

775
01:31:45,317 --> 01:31:47,197
No betrayal will be left unpunished!

776
01:31:52,197 --> 01:31:53,877
Stay loyal to your traditions.

777
01:31:54,677 --> 01:31:59,157
Well said, Kutluca.
No betrayal will be left unpunished.

778
01:31:59,557 --> 01:32:01,397
And my alps will do
what our traditions demand.

779
01:32:16,317 --> 01:32:19,357
I'd have preferred you
alive to witness my victory.

780
01:32:19,837 --> 01:32:22,997
But we can't keep the hellhounds waiting.

781
01:32:24,237 --> 01:32:25,877
I won't be going alone, Ural.

782
01:32:35,037 --> 01:32:37,397
I bear witness that
there is no god but Allah...

783
01:32:40,957 --> 01:32:45,957
and Muhammad is his messenger.

784
01:33:08,037 --> 01:33:10,317
Get everyone into their tents!

785
01:33:10,757 --> 01:33:13,317
Punish anyone who refuses to obey.

786
01:33:13,717 --> 01:33:15,077
-Go on.
-Yes, my bey<i>.</i>

787
01:33:15,237 --> 01:33:18,917
-My bey.
-Did you take the women to the main tent?

788
01:33:19,277 --> 01:33:21,957
Yes, my bey<i>.</i>
Aslıhan Hatun is there too.

789
01:33:22,117 --> 01:33:24,397
She resisted, my bey<i>.</i>
We had to take her hostage as well.

790
01:33:26,557 --> 01:33:29,117
-How about the people?
-They're resisting, my bey<i>.</i>

791
01:33:29,757 --> 01:33:32,317
Don't worry. I know how to silence them.

792
01:33:32,717 --> 01:33:33,797
Come on!

793
01:33:44,584 --> 01:33:45,704
Shame!

794
01:33:47,184 --> 01:33:49,224
Traitors! Shame!

795
01:33:49,384 --> 01:33:53,304
-Traitors!
-Murderers!

796
01:33:54,344 --> 01:33:55,544
Dogs!

797
01:34:02,424 --> 01:34:05,744
You defy our traditions! Shame!

798
01:34:06,904 --> 01:34:08,504
Go back to your tents!

799
01:34:09,304 --> 01:34:10,584
Shame!

800
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:13,024
If anyone comes any closer,
we'll kill them.

801
01:34:15,424 --> 01:34:17,584
Disobey and we'll kill you!

802
01:34:18,744 --> 01:34:20,384
Don't make us spill blood!

803
01:34:24,424 --> 01:34:27,184
Do what we tell you!
Get back to your tents!

804
01:34:27,504 --> 01:34:30,904
You've defied tradition! Shame!

805
01:34:37,464 --> 01:34:38,704
Dogs!

806
01:34:47,344 --> 01:34:48,544
Ingratitude!

807
01:34:50,704 --> 01:34:51,624
Ingratitude!

808
01:34:57,344 --> 01:35:01,024
I have come to save you from tyranny!

809
01:35:01,704 --> 01:35:04,944
I have come to give you back
the greatness you have lost!

810
01:35:06,144 --> 01:35:09,504
You resist instead of obeying us?

811
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:11,784
We'll never obey you.

812
01:35:12,664 --> 01:35:14,784
Our Bey is Aliyar Bey.

813
01:35:17,184 --> 01:35:21,104
You're the tyrant! You're oppressing
your own people. Traitor!

814
01:35:44,104 --> 01:35:46,944
That's what you get for defying me!

815
01:35:49,104 --> 01:35:50,744
Anyone else want to speak up?

816
01:35:51,344 --> 01:35:52,344
Huh?

817
01:35:54,984 --> 01:35:58,744
When the Cavdars... regain their glory

818
01:35:59,384 --> 01:36:01,624
you'll be ashamed
and will beg for my forgiveness!

819
01:36:32,024 --> 01:36:38,064
Victory is ours, Ural Bey!
Victory is ours, Ural Bey!

820
01:36:38,384 --> 01:36:41,704
May your leadership last forever.
Victory is ours, my Bey.

821
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:45,304
May your leadership last forever.
Victory is ours, my Bey.

822
01:36:45,744 --> 01:36:49,424
May your leadership last forever.
Victory is ours, my Bey.

823
01:36:49,704 --> 01:36:52,744
May your leadership last forever.
Victory is ours, my Bey.

824
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:56,544
May your leadership last forever.
Victory is ours, my Bey.

825
01:36:56,624 --> 01:37:00,184
May your leadership last forever.
Victory is ours, my Bey.

826
01:37:00,264 --> 01:37:03,624
May your leadership last forever.
Victory is ours, my Bey.

827
01:37:03,824 --> 01:37:06,424
May your leadership last forever.
Victory is ours, my Bey.

828
01:37:06,824 --> 01:37:08,664
May your leadership last forever.

829
01:37:11,704 --> 01:37:15,464
I've returned with glory
to the tribe I left ashamed.

830
01:37:16,224 --> 01:37:17,264
Thank you, my warriors.

831
01:37:17,704 --> 01:37:23,824
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

832
01:37:24,064 --> 01:37:29,944
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

833
01:37:30,304 --> 01:37:32,224
Bastard!

834
01:37:33,144 --> 01:37:39,064
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

835
01:37:39,384 --> 01:37:45,344
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

836
01:37:45,464 --> 01:37:51,344
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

837
01:37:51,424 --> 01:37:57,424
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

838
01:37:57,544 --> 01:38:00,464
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

839
01:38:03,584 --> 01:38:04,584
My warriors!

840
01:38:05,744 --> 01:38:08,904
Brave men of the Cavdar tribe.

841
01:38:09,664 --> 01:38:13,104
At last, justice will
prevail in our tribe.

842
01:38:14,504 --> 01:38:19,584
Both my father's tent and our tribe
have been reclaimed from the traitors.

843
01:38:20,584 --> 01:38:23,464
Now is the time for vengeance.

844
01:38:26,344 --> 01:38:30,104
Ertuğrul and Aliyar will meet their end.

845
01:38:31,744 --> 01:38:35,704
Only Cavdars may rule this land.

846
01:38:35,984 --> 01:38:39,744
And you... will be the alps who won...

847
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:43,384
this great victory.

848
01:38:43,624 --> 01:38:49,184
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

849
01:38:49,384 --> 01:38:54,824
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

850
01:38:54,904 --> 01:38:58,744
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

851
01:39:17,984 --> 01:39:20,984
It seems that Ural Bey
has taken control of the tribe.

852
01:39:24,104 --> 01:39:28,704
Ural... I hope you don't mess this up.

853
01:39:29,784 --> 01:39:33,184
When Aliyar gets home, there's going to be
a great welcoming feast waiting for him.

854
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:31,784
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

855
01:40:31,944 --> 01:40:37,384
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

856
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:42,904
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

857
01:40:43,024 --> 01:40:45,344
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

858
01:40:45,504 --> 01:40:46,744
Bastard!

859
01:40:47,264 --> 01:40:49,424
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

860
01:40:49,504 --> 01:40:50,784
Bamsi...

861
01:40:51,704 --> 01:40:54,104
Where are you? Where are you, Bamsi?

862
01:40:54,664 --> 01:40:55,944
I told you, Mother.

863
01:40:56,464 --> 01:41:00,224
I told you that as long as that man
remained alive, he'd seek vengeance.

864
01:41:02,624 --> 01:41:07,064
He can't touch us as long as
my Ertuğrul is alive.

865
01:41:07,704 --> 01:41:10,304
My son will save us very soon.

866
01:41:11,744 --> 01:41:15,144
How, Mother?
He doesn't even know we're here.

867
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:19,264
It's hopeless.

868
01:41:21,744 --> 01:41:24,584
Don't show fear before these dogs!

869
01:41:25,744 --> 01:41:30,744
Our job now is to stall
them until Ertuğrul arrives.

870
01:41:31,624 --> 01:41:38,544
Long live Ural Bey!
Long live Ural Bey!

871
01:41:39,464 --> 01:41:40,904
It's you who deserves to die, Ural!

872
01:41:43,064 --> 01:41:44,664
Shame on you!

873
01:41:57,344 --> 01:42:00,784
Shame on you, Aslıhan.

874
01:42:01,344 --> 01:42:05,464
You stand with these traitors
instead of with me.

875
01:42:10,384 --> 01:42:13,504
You choose your enemy over your brother.

876
01:42:13,704 --> 01:42:15,904
The path of the crooked man
is never straight, Ural.

877
01:42:16,544 --> 01:42:19,064
You won't get away with this.

878
01:42:21,104 --> 01:42:21,984
Don't worry.

879
01:42:23,604 --> 01:42:27,964
As soon as this is over
I'm sending you to Sadettin.

880
01:42:30,104 --> 01:42:32,304
He'll get what's coming to him too!

881
01:42:34,224 --> 01:42:36,784
He'll find out what
it means to let me down!

882
01:43:01,184 --> 01:43:05,464
Sir, Ertuğrul and Aliyar Bey
are riding towards the tribe.

883
01:43:07,664 --> 01:43:10,704
What did you just say? Ertuğrul?

884
01:43:11,184 --> 01:43:12,984
It seems he's found out about the coup.

885
01:43:13,544 --> 01:43:16,704
The council meeting must have been
cancelled, there's no other explanation.

886
01:43:41,064 --> 01:43:44,224
I, Bey of the Cavdars,

887
01:43:44,864 --> 01:43:46,544
son of Candar Bey, Ural Bey,

888
01:43:47,944 --> 01:43:52,544
swore I'd avenge my father and son.

889
01:43:54,144 --> 01:43:59,464
No one will doubt my honor
when they see me fulfill that oath.

890
01:44:00,224 --> 01:44:01,184
Honor?

891
01:44:05,144 --> 01:44:06,944
What honor do you have, Ural?

892
01:44:10,224 --> 01:44:12,664
As long as Ertuğrul is alive,

893
01:44:13,024 --> 01:44:17,584
all you can do is spread poison with
your tongue like a loose woman.

894
01:44:21,584 --> 01:44:23,344
Just wait, you'll meet your end.

895
01:44:24,984 --> 01:44:29,424
Ertuğrul and Aliyar
have no idea what's coming.

896
01:44:32,624 --> 01:44:35,744
There's nothing anyone
can do to save you now.

897
01:44:37,944 --> 01:44:41,984
So many people have been
saved from you clutches, Ural.

898
01:44:42,864 --> 01:44:46,264
What have you ever
managed to keep hold of? Huh?

899
01:44:46,944 --> 01:44:50,384
Who do you think you are?
What could have made you so arrogant? Huh?

900
01:44:52,344 --> 01:44:53,544
Stop!

901
01:44:54,584 --> 01:44:55,704
I beg you, don't.

902
01:44:57,504 --> 01:45:00,584
You'll be known as a coward
who murders women.

903
01:45:02,944 --> 01:45:04,184
Let them go.

904
01:45:05,584 --> 01:45:08,144
If you're so strong, take on a man.

905
01:45:09,864 --> 01:45:12,384
He won't dare face Ertuğrul.

906
01:45:14,384 --> 01:45:18,264
What do you expect from a man
who sought refuge in his enemy's castle?

907
01:45:21,424 --> 01:45:25,384
Your sword is only good enough for women.

908
01:45:29,944 --> 01:45:31,904
Where's your son? Huh?

909
01:45:32,304 --> 01:45:34,744
Where is he? Have him come save you now.

910
01:45:35,184 --> 01:45:38,144
We'll see if my sword is good
enough for him or not.

911
01:45:38,784 --> 01:45:40,664
If Ertuğrul Bey had known...

912
01:45:42,304 --> 01:45:45,464
he'd have taken your head
a long time ago, Ural.

913
01:45:46,184 --> 01:45:50,384
You're just a traitor who
plots and sets traps.

914
01:45:51,624 --> 01:45:52,704
Traitor?

915
01:45:53,144 --> 01:45:54,144
Traitor?

916
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:56,104
-Let go!
-Let her go, you dog!

917
01:45:56,984 --> 01:45:58,024
Let me go!

918
01:45:58,664 --> 01:46:03,024
Now you'll see what happens
to those who set sibling against sibling.

919
01:46:05,984 --> 01:46:06,984
Let me go!

920
01:46:07,064 --> 01:46:09,944
My Bamsi, I didn't get enough
time with you, my Bamsi.

921
01:46:10,344 --> 01:46:11,824
-Stop!
-Alps!

922
01:46:16,184 --> 01:46:17,184
Stop!

923
01:46:20,424 --> 01:46:26,424
I swear there is no god but God.
Muhammad is the messenger of God.

924
01:46:29,184 --> 01:46:30,544
Martyrdom...

925
01:46:31,984 --> 01:46:33,544
is an honor for us.

926
01:46:33,944 --> 01:46:35,584
-God is great.
-God is great.

927
01:46:41,064 --> 01:46:42,184
Stop!

928
01:46:42,824 --> 01:46:45,544
I'm ashamed to share
the same blood as you.

929
01:46:47,104 --> 01:46:49,264
Stop. I'm begging you, don't do it.

930
01:46:49,664 --> 01:46:52,144
My enemies deserve death! Death!

931
01:47:12,344 --> 01:47:13,824
Here they come, Mother!

932
01:47:15,264 --> 01:47:16,144
Bamsi!

933
01:47:19,624 --> 01:47:20,544
Ertuğrul!

934
01:48:07,104 --> 01:48:08,104
Stand back!

935
01:48:18,384 --> 01:48:20,304
Since when do Turks

936
01:48:21,304 --> 01:48:25,664
take women as shields
when they ambush men, Ural?

937
01:48:27,024 --> 01:48:28,744
There is no place
for what you call justice,

938
01:48:29,144 --> 01:48:31,224
even among non-believers.

939
01:48:37,944 --> 01:48:40,824
You'll address me as Ural Bey!

940
01:48:41,744 --> 01:48:44,904
I am Bey of this tribe.

941
01:48:47,504 --> 01:48:48,744
Let that be known!

942
01:48:49,824 --> 01:48:51,784
You're nothing in my eyes, Ural!

943
01:48:53,104 --> 01:48:57,824
You're a disgrace, both to my father's
tent and to that sword you hold!

944
01:48:58,184 --> 01:49:01,184
You conspired to take
my title away from me,

945
01:49:02,384 --> 01:49:04,824
and gave it to my brother,
Ertuğrul's puppet.

946
01:49:06,064 --> 01:49:10,784
I claim my birth right.
You hear that? My birth right!

947
01:49:11,264 --> 01:49:12,344
Have you sunk so low

948
01:49:13,544 --> 01:49:16,664
that you're asking my alps
to kill their own Bey, Ural?

949
01:49:17,304 --> 01:49:22,224
Neither our Sultan nor our tribe
will let you get away with this.

950
01:49:23,504 --> 01:49:24,744
Unless the sky falls,

951
01:49:26,504 --> 01:49:28,064
or the ground collapses,

952
01:49:28,864 --> 01:49:32,384
no one can corrupt the Turks' tradition.

953
01:49:34,704 --> 01:49:38,624
You attempted to, Ural.
Now it's time to pay.

954
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,224
Stand back, alps.

955
01:49:45,104 --> 01:49:46,344
You won't only ruin us,

956
01:49:47,344 --> 01:49:49,944
but your brothers
who also live on this land

957
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:52,704
and your state, too.

958
01:49:55,664 --> 01:49:59,864
If you follow Ural
your destination is obvious.

959
01:50:03,984 --> 01:50:07,744
Surrender... to justice and decency.

960
01:50:11,624 --> 01:50:12,744
Alps!

961
01:50:14,744 --> 01:50:15,864
Kill them!

962
01:50:51,784 --> 01:50:54,024
-Let my daughter go!
-Let me go!

963
01:51:17,584 --> 01:51:18,824
Ertuğrul.

964
01:51:25,104 --> 01:51:26,224
Ertuğrul.

965
01:52:13,664 --> 01:52:14,824
Ertuğrul.

966
01:52:16,424 --> 01:52:19,544
Sir, things aren't going well.

967
01:52:20,064 --> 01:52:22,264
Ertuğrul and his alps must have attacked.

968
01:52:23,704 --> 01:52:26,384
Stupid Ural. He'll lose again.

969
01:52:27,264 --> 01:52:30,664
Sir, Ural Bey has more alps on his side.

970
01:52:32,024 --> 01:52:36,224
Courage wins wars,
not numbers, Commander.

971
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,824
Courage.

972
01:53:09,504 --> 01:53:13,784
Hafsa, Hafsa, Hafsa, Hafsa.
I'll save you, hold on. Hold on.

973
01:53:16,384 --> 01:53:19,664
Stand back. Or I'll kill your woman.

974
01:53:20,584 --> 01:53:23,864
Let her go. Fight like a man.

975
01:53:42,784 --> 01:53:45,344
Your new regime has come
crashing down, Ural.

976
01:53:46,504 --> 01:53:48,504
You've poisoned all of us.

977
01:53:49,744 --> 01:53:52,344
With your ambition and rage,

978
01:53:52,544 --> 01:53:57,304
you've ruined the lives of
many alps, beys and innocents.

979
01:53:58,904 --> 01:54:03,384
And now you hide behind a woman.

980
01:54:05,544 --> 01:54:09,344
How low can you fall, Ural? How low?

981
01:54:09,784 --> 01:54:12,824
Men, my alps, attack!

982
01:54:40,704 --> 01:54:41,624
Ertuğrul!

983
01:54:45,784 --> 01:54:49,984
What are you doing?
I said attack! Attack!

984
01:55:31,304 --> 01:55:33,744
Sir, they've asked for our help.

985
01:55:35,304 --> 01:55:36,984
Ural's life is in danger.

986
01:55:38,424 --> 01:55:39,544
Damn it.

987
01:55:43,144 --> 01:55:44,904
Sir, what do you want us to do?

988
01:56:23,544 --> 01:56:24,544
My son!

989
01:56:46,704 --> 01:56:47,744
Ertuğrul...

990
01:56:48,944 --> 01:56:52,424
I'll end your line, Ertuğrul!
I'll be your worst nightmare!

991
01:57:44,704 --> 01:57:48,384
You and men like you
would make yourselves king

992
01:57:48,824 --> 01:57:50,184
with the crown of betrayal.

993
01:57:53,104 --> 01:57:57,664
I'll take your heads until
each one of you is dead.

994
01:58:13,664 --> 01:58:17,944
God Almighty... I live for vengeance.

995
01:58:19,344 --> 01:58:23,344
Not for bread, water or a husband.

996
01:58:25,104 --> 01:58:27,824
I would sacrifice anything for it.

997
01:58:31,704 --> 01:58:33,464
Bless me with victory.

998
01:59:06,784 --> 01:59:09,904
Praise hell for traitors!

999
01:59:29,864 --> 01:59:31,104
Ural!

1000
02:00:00,424 --> 02:00:05,304
We can't win against
the Turks when they are united.

1001
02:00:06,424 --> 02:00:08,544
We can't match their strength.

1002
02:00:09,744 --> 02:00:12,704
I'll go to the emperor,
ask for more soldiers.

1003
02:00:14,224 --> 02:00:18,424
It's obvious we can't stop the Turks with
only the walls of the Karacahisar Castle.

1004
02:00:20,024 --> 02:00:21,224
Back to the castle.

1005
02:00:26,544 --> 02:00:27,744
Back to the castle!

1006
02:00:38,464 --> 02:00:40,104
I have nobody, Lord.

1007
02:00:42,944 --> 02:00:44,664
Nobody but you.

1008
02:01:05,104 --> 02:01:08,424
There can be no mercy!

1009
02:01:10,104 --> 02:01:11,784
Only rage!

1010
02:01:17,264 --> 02:01:18,944
God, give me strength.

1011
02:01:20,744 --> 02:01:23,744
I won't come to you until
I get my revenge, Father!

1012
02:01:25,384 --> 02:01:26,904
Come now, Vasilius!

1013
02:01:29,664 --> 02:01:31,664
Taste my poison!

1014
02:01:41,664 --> 02:01:43,064
-Mother!
-Dündar!

1015
02:01:45,024 --> 02:01:46,144
Ertuğrul!

1016
02:01:52,064 --> 02:01:53,064
Bamsi!

1017
02:01:54,504 --> 02:01:55,624
My brave warrior.

1018
02:01:59,584 --> 02:02:01,504
May you suffer for your sins, brother.

1019
02:02:28,824 --> 02:02:30,064
My son.

1020
02:02:51,384 --> 02:02:52,864
You came home, sister.

1021
02:02:53,944 --> 02:02:55,264
Our home is ruined, brother.

1022
02:02:57,544 --> 02:02:59,824
We'll turn this place
into a paradise, Aslıhan.

1023
02:03:00,824 --> 02:03:03,944
It's all over. Over.

1024
02:03:12,024 --> 02:03:17,224
We have seen
what is true and what is false.

1025
02:03:18,864 --> 02:03:22,304
We've known the good and the bad.

1026
02:03:23,144 --> 02:03:27,504
We've seen which tree was rotten.

1027
02:03:30,464 --> 02:03:34,944
We have been wounded.
But we've learned well.

1028
02:03:36,704 --> 02:03:41,024
If a day comes
when our names are but history...

1029
02:03:42,944 --> 02:03:44,184
our deeds forgotten...

1030
02:03:45,784 --> 02:03:47,704
our ancestors forgotten...

1031
02:03:48,904 --> 02:03:54,104
know that that day comes only
because we have forgotten this treachery

1032
02:03:54,864 --> 02:03:58,384
and climbed the same rotten tree.

1033
02:03:58,784 --> 02:03:59,864
That is the day...

1034
02:04:01,104 --> 02:04:02,864
we dishonor our word...

1035
02:04:04,264 --> 02:04:05,784
and give up.

1036
02:04:07,104 --> 02:04:09,984
That is the day we defy tradition

1037
02:04:10,984 --> 02:04:13,944
and yield before the infidel.

1038
02:04:30,464 --> 02:04:32,144
Never fear.

1039
02:04:34,064 --> 02:04:36,224
Our honorable blood

1040
02:04:37,264 --> 02:04:39,384
keeps tradition strong

1041
02:04:40,024 --> 02:04:43,184
and keeps our banners flying high.

1042
02:04:45,144 --> 02:04:46,904
As long as this blood flows in our veins,

1043
02:04:47,984 --> 02:04:50,064
wherever we step is our home...

1044
02:04:52,304 --> 02:04:56,384
wherever our voice is heard
is our motherland.

1045
02:05:03,304 --> 02:05:04,784
God is great!

1046
02:05:04,984 --> 02:05:10,784
God is great! God is great!

1047
02:05:10,984 --> 02:05:16,064
God is great! God is great!

1048
02:05:16,224 --> 02:05:22,904
God is great! God is great!

1049
02:05:23,024 --> 02:05:26,544
God is great! God is great!

1050
02:05:26,664 --> 02:05:32,944
God is great! God is great!

1051
02:05:33,064 --> 02:05:37,824
God is great! God is great!

1052
02:05:37,904 --> 02:05:44,864
God is great! God is great!
