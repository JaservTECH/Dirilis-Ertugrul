00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 66 will start after 12:34 min.

13:01.127 --> 13:04.207
What happened to your foot, Philip?
You're limping.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.847
The work of an arrogant drunk.

13:09.647 --> 13:11.167
I suppose you put him in his place.

14:45.207 --> 14:46.527
<i>A Bey's skill lies in</i>

14:46.607 --> 14:51.007
<i>knowing if the devil is coming from</i>
<i>the right side or the left side.</i>

15:01.207 --> 15:03.247
I am Suleyman Shah's son Ertuğrul!

15:05.607 --> 15:07.447
I want all the world to know...

15:10.047 --> 15:12.047
that any fool who
hankers after what's mine...

15:15.767 --> 15:16.927
will pay the penalty.

15:27.487 --> 15:28.447
Take this bastard away.

15:40.887 --> 15:41.847
Simon.

15:44.327 --> 15:47.727
Thieves run wild here
and you're completely unaware of it.

15:54.007 --> 15:57.167
Sometimes the dagger comes from
the place you trust the most, Ertuğrul.

15:58.167 --> 16:00.727
You couldn't protect
your rugs against thieves.

16:02.487 --> 16:03.727
You owe money to the French.

16:04.007 --> 16:07.567
We're here to agree business
which might give bread to everyone.

16:09.167 --> 16:11.647
But I see you are still wounded.

16:12.727 --> 16:14.527
If we sit down at that table and...

16:15.607 --> 16:18.127
shake hands, I believe that will
salve the wounds each of us bear.

16:21.447 --> 16:23.287
There's no point dragging this on,
Ertuğrul Bey.

16:27.447 --> 16:28.407
Simon.

16:39.767 --> 16:40.727
Ertuğrul Bey.

16:42.207 --> 16:47.487
I have no wish to offend a kind man
like yourself, nor a Bey like Aliyar.

17:05.247 --> 17:07.847
Go ahead Ertuğrul Bey,
be the guest of honor at my table.

17:30.647 --> 17:34.127
I told Simon everything
you discussed and agreed

17:34.247 --> 17:35.607
with Candar Bey, Ertuğrul Bey.

17:37.327 --> 17:38.407
What do you want, Simon?

17:39.887 --> 17:43.847
Firstly, please forgive me for the
unpleasant incident that just occurred.

17:45.247 --> 17:46.727
Let's disregard it.

17:47.247 --> 17:52.447
And hope that it protects us from
further such wickedness.

17:54.327 --> 17:55.287
All right.

18:00.767 --> 18:03.247
I like to gather
business partners together

18:03.607 --> 18:05.087
and have them shake hands.

18:05.527 --> 18:10.487
The demands you and Candar Bey make
seem very reasonable to me.

18:22.887 --> 18:26.487
I see that...
both sides are in agreement.

18:27.247 --> 18:29.487
All we can say is "good luck."

18:32.087 --> 18:35.447
And that, from now on...

18:36.927 --> 18:39.127
my brother will take care
of business such as this.

18:58.687 --> 19:00.047
What do we do now, Bey?

19:02.167 --> 19:04.847
We'll show them who Ural is.

19:10.727 --> 19:11.727
Turgut Alp.

19:15.407 --> 19:17.967
How are the wounds
inflicted by your Ertuğrul Bey?

19:21.047 --> 19:22.367
My wounds are fine.

19:23.367 --> 19:26.207
But he's not my Bey anymore...

19:27.327 --> 19:28.567
he's your partner.

19:29.607 --> 19:31.727
It is you who must now
worry about being wounded.

19:33.807 --> 19:34.927
What do you mean?

19:37.087 --> 19:39.407
He's like the wolf
which has its claws in its prey...

19:40.487 --> 19:43.407
he won't let go before
he gets a bite of its flesh.

19:44.967 --> 19:48.367
When he goes hunting,
he never comes back empty handed.

19:49.807 --> 19:51.847
And if he's out hunting with his pack...

19:52.447 --> 19:55.287
there won't be any prey left.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.167
Speak more clearly.

19:58.967 --> 20:00.047
What I'm saying is...

20:01.247 --> 20:02.767
be careful, Ural Bey.

20:04.767 --> 20:07.447
You'll live to regret knowing him,
just like me.

20:13.647 --> 20:17.647
I'd like to have a long talk
with you some time,

20:18.527 --> 20:20.647
and hear more about your experiences.

20:21.607 --> 20:22.567
Sure.

20:23.407 --> 20:26.407
I live here now. I'll be waiting.

20:38.327 --> 20:41.287
I stood up against the Pope's
scoundrels who vandalized Constantinople

20:41.847 --> 20:44.807
and the many barbarians
who came from the North.

20:45.687 --> 20:50.087
I lost my son, my wife,
and many men to this cause.

20:50.647 --> 20:54.327
I established this bazaar with everything
I had left, Ertuğrul Bey.

20:54.967 --> 20:56.727
I saw that the most difficult thing...

20:58.007 --> 21:01.847
is to have brave and honest men
beside you that you can trust.

21:02.967 --> 21:05.527
I've crossed many lands with my people.

21:06.847 --> 21:10.407
I've seen every trick,
I've seen every act of treachery.

21:11.847 --> 21:14.287
I could make a castle
with the enemy heads I've decapitated.

21:16.647 --> 21:17.887
What I learned was

21:18.807 --> 21:21.407
you couldn't trust anyone in those lands.

21:22.647 --> 21:26.487
That's why my men will protect
the women in the bazaar.

21:33.007 --> 21:34.687
I wouldn't want that burden anyway.

21:36.727 --> 21:41.247
You Turks love fighting
as much as we love gold.

21:42.887 --> 21:46.047
You get the battles... we get the gold.

21:54.287 --> 21:58.407
One day, you'll wish
you had a sword at your side,

21:59.767 --> 22:02.487
instead of pouches full of gold.

22:14.127 --> 22:17.927
Let's not disrupt the peace, Ertuğrul Bey.
Let's enjoy the agreement.

22:18.927 --> 22:21.007
Maria, let's get the table ready.

22:22.047 --> 22:23.287
But don't bring wine.

22:24.167 --> 22:26.887
We don't want to offend
our Muslim guests.

22:33.487 --> 22:36.527
Ural Bey is a little upset about this,
am I right, Aliyar Bey?

22:37.527 --> 22:38.487
I doubt it.

22:39.447 --> 22:41.127
Ural Bey is skilled at trading.

22:41.927 --> 22:43.247
He'll use his knowledge.

23:19.527 --> 23:23.407
I see you're feasting before you
have paid your debt, Ertuğrul Bey.

23:26.487 --> 23:28.007
My debt is still valid, Ricardo.

23:31.727 --> 23:36.247
You can't come to my inn
and question my guests, Ricardo.

23:39.047 --> 23:40.607
You want your gold?

23:41.447 --> 23:43.727
Philip, give him his gold.

23:52.327 --> 23:53.887
Your account is closed, Ricardo.

24:02.847 --> 24:05.287
Now you owe me, Ertuğrul Bey.

24:05.647 --> 24:08.207
You can pay me when
the rug house starts to make money.

24:11.447 --> 24:12.407
Thank you.

24:40.902 --> 24:44.422
I know for a fact that, sooner or later,

24:44.982 --> 24:47.942
you'll rule not just this market,
but the whole of Bithynia.

24:48.902 --> 24:51.062
I too believe that day will come, Amanda.

24:53.622 --> 24:55.182
And I'll take you into my harem.

24:56.622 --> 24:58.302
We won't have to meet
in secret anymore.

24:59.742 --> 25:04.942
Now, find me the warrior
you praised so highly.

25:06.822 --> 25:08.862
It's time I overcame these obstacles

25:08.942 --> 25:12.022
and get rid of them, one by one.

25:13.382 --> 25:17.342
Including the man I call my brother.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.022
He's a threat to the tribe, sir.

25:20.782 --> 25:22.382
I'm afraid he'll get in your way.

25:23.902 --> 25:25.382
Do as I say.

25:27.222 --> 25:29.542
My plan to win is
a massive undertaking, Amanda.

25:31.222 --> 25:33.622
But you'll profit from it
like never before.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.022
What do you need?

25:40.702 --> 25:44.782
The women of Kayi
will not make it to the bazaar that day.

25:46.662 --> 25:50.582
Let's see who Ertuğrul's wrath
is actually going to hurt.

25:56.382 --> 25:59.102
No one can know I was behind this.

26:00.022 --> 26:01.222
Got it?

26:02.782 --> 26:03.822
Yes, sir.

26:05.182 --> 26:08.382
But... what do I get in return?

26:31.422 --> 26:32.382
Come on.

27:04.782 --> 27:07.262
I see you've recovered well, Turgut Alp.

27:09.942 --> 27:10.902
Thanks to God.

27:12.462 --> 27:14.662
As long as I have the help of my friends,

27:17.782 --> 27:21.942
my wounds heal
and my heart rests assured.

27:33.382 --> 27:36.022
If your wounds have healed,
it's high time you came back.

27:39.582 --> 27:41.382
I'm not coming back.

27:54.422 --> 27:57.542
Until you spill the blood
of those cowardly ambushers...

27:58.462 --> 28:00.542
every breath I take is a curse.

28:13.102 --> 28:15.142
There's a right time for everything.

28:19.382 --> 28:20.342
In the past,

28:22.102 --> 28:23.422
if we were ambushed,

28:25.302 --> 28:28.182
the Ertuğrul Bey I knew
would kill to avenge us.

28:29.782 --> 28:30.902
But now...

28:34.502 --> 28:36.862
Ertuğrul Bey designates the time
for everything.

28:45.142 --> 28:46.262
From now on...

28:48.582 --> 28:49.662
you rule...

28:51.342 --> 28:52.822
and I hunt, Ertuğrul Bey.

28:57.022 --> 28:58.142
Recover quickly.

29:00.742 --> 29:01.742
And come to your senses.

29:04.622 --> 29:07.262
Know that I'll avenge our sons.

29:15.582 --> 29:16.542
Come, Bamsi.

29:49.742 --> 29:53.862
Simon seemed impressed by you, sir.
He even paid your debt.

29:55.582 --> 29:59.262
Simon wouldn't shoulder
anyone's responsibility.

30:00.302 --> 30:02.022
He must be after something.

30:02.622 --> 30:05.302
Let's wait and see what he does
to get his gold back from me.

30:06.262 --> 30:10.982
My father was right.
I've got a lot to learn from you, sir.

30:11.582 --> 30:12.662
Thank you.

30:13.302 --> 30:14.502
Don't mention it, Aliyar Bey.

30:15.462 --> 30:16.302
Your brother Ural...

30:18.142 --> 30:19.622
He wasn't pleased.

30:20.422 --> 30:21.902
It's up to you to deal with him.

30:23.262 --> 30:24.902
My brother is unpredictable.

30:25.262 --> 30:27.942
But my father has him
under control, don't worry.

30:29.542 --> 30:31.022
I should get back
so that I can tell Father.

30:31.422 --> 30:33.622
All right, give him my regards.

30:35.862 --> 30:36.822
Thank you, sir.

30:37.902 --> 30:38.902
Safe travels.

30:41.582 --> 30:42.542
Ertuğrul Bey.

30:43.982 --> 30:46.262
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

30:46.782 --> 30:49.142
I'd like to visit your settlement
to trade, with your permission.

30:51.462 --> 30:53.902
You are most welcome, Merchant Hasan.

30:54.622 --> 30:57.222
But I doubt our settlement
will satisfy you.

30:58.622 --> 31:00.142
I'll be content with whatever, sir.

31:00.982 --> 31:04.022
I want to buy milk, meat,
and cheese, not goods.

31:06.382 --> 31:08.062
You are welcome anytime, Hasan.

31:08.622 --> 31:10.542
Thank you, sir. God bless you.

31:11.822 --> 31:12.662
Godspeed.

31:33.102 --> 31:34.662
We must speak now.

32:25.662 --> 32:27.302
Where are you going?

32:36.742 --> 32:38.262
I must find out.

32:40.462 --> 32:41.462
I must.

32:54.702 --> 32:58.982
Ertuğrul will bring his men
on the pretext of protecting his women.

32:59.862 --> 33:03.742
Isn't it dangerous for them
to be living with us like a cancer, Simon?

33:05.942 --> 33:08.862
I do not believe Ertuğrul
is the sultan's spy.

33:09.982 --> 33:14.262
I need him and his men
if I'm going to accomplish my mission.

33:15.102 --> 33:18.542
We must gain his trust.
We are few in number.

33:19.422 --> 33:23.502
I must pit the Turks,
Armenians and Greeks

33:23.942 --> 33:25.622
against each other.

33:28.102 --> 33:31.622
I needed two things to achieve this end,
and I got them both.

33:32.062 --> 33:35.262
The passion of Ural
and the bravery of Ertuğrul.

33:36.462 --> 33:39.902
If we pit them against each other,
our army will have an easier time.

33:40.662 --> 33:42.622
When should I depart, Master Simon?

33:43.022 --> 33:44.502
Head for the island of Lesbos.

33:46.022 --> 33:47.342
As you wish, sir.

33:51.302 --> 33:53.262
Go in good faith, Knight Tristan.

34:01.222 --> 34:04.062
Maria, did we get the news
I've been waiting for from Konya?

34:05.222 --> 34:07.462
We're looking forward to the dove, still.

34:21.102 --> 34:23.782
My father taught me to share...

34:26.982 --> 34:29.622
my food with my kin first.

34:34.382 --> 34:35.782
And look what you did.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.702
You can't prosper if
you don't share, brother.

34:40.502 --> 34:44.862
Without sharing what you have,
you can't make friends or allies.

34:48.062 --> 34:51.862
Did you go to Damascus to learn
these fancy words?

34:53.182 --> 34:55.262
You permit our food

34:55.502 --> 34:57.942
to be made a present
of to that questionable fellow.

34:58.822 --> 35:03.022
Father prevented the catastrophe
you almost caused, brother.

35:04.742 --> 35:05.582
What if Ertuğrul Bey

35:06.462 --> 35:10.062
had found out it was you
who killed his Alps?

35:12.822 --> 35:15.982
Through his decisions,
our father secured us a brave supporter.

35:22.542 --> 35:23.502
Brother.

35:26.342 --> 35:30.422
Don't you dare hurt us
with another mistake.

35:31.182 --> 35:33.342
Pity. Such a pity!

35:34.302 --> 35:38.022
We'll pay for your stupidity together.
Are you so blind?

35:38.742 --> 35:41.462
Why do you carry this grudge
against Ertuğrul, brother?

35:42.822 --> 35:45.422
Ertuğrul's wormed his way close to us.

35:46.302 --> 35:48.902
Soon, he'll rush our tribe
with the few men he has left.

35:49.222 --> 35:50.822
He'll get stronger.

35:50.942 --> 35:54.062
Then he'll rule over this realm.
How can you not see this?

35:54.702 --> 35:57.542
If he rightfully deserves it,
he shall rule.

35:58.422 --> 36:00.302
May God let us not stray
from his just path.

36:00.742 --> 36:03.022
For unity is only possible
through justice.

36:04.422 --> 36:09.342
If there is a speck of doubt in that,
it'll be the end of us, brother.

36:10.182 --> 36:11.342
The end.

36:12.302 --> 36:14.062
And then you'll have neither a tribe...

36:15.982 --> 36:16.902
nor your traditions left.

36:34.982 --> 36:37.622
{\an8}KAYI TRIBE

36:40.742 --> 36:43.982
I'm relieved to hear
our Alps will provide security...

36:44.542 --> 36:48.022
to our women at the marketplace.

36:49.182 --> 36:50.222
Thank you, Mother.

36:51.982 --> 36:53.302
We scared Simon a bit.

36:54.862 --> 36:56.422
But that's all right.

36:58.022 --> 37:03.582
If you scare your enemy once,
you can then win wars without a fight.

37:04.702 --> 37:06.782
When will these games end?

37:07.622 --> 37:10.222
I suspect Simon is John the Baptist,
Halime Sultan.

37:13.022 --> 37:17.582
However, until we find out
who is behind him, and to what end,

37:18.342 --> 37:19.382
we can't move on.

37:21.142 --> 37:23.662
If Simon is the Crusaders' spy as you say

37:23.822 --> 37:27.822
he'll want to go after Doğan,
who he believes is the Sultan's spy.

37:27.942 --> 37:30.702
When he does, we'll do what's necessary.

37:32.822 --> 37:36.262
With respect sir, it feels that
there's no end in sight to these games.

37:38.382 --> 37:39.702
They will end, Halime Sultan.

37:41.182 --> 37:42.182
They will end.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.462
The day we establish our own nation,

37:46.062 --> 37:48.342
the day our flag flies
over our heads, they will end.

37:51.302 --> 37:56.222
God is merely preparing us
for more sophisticated games.

37:59.902 --> 38:02.502
My hope increases the more
I see these tricks being played.

38:03.302 --> 38:04.302
How so, sir?

38:05.542 --> 38:08.182
There is nobody between here
and Iznik who could stop us.

38:09.942 --> 38:11.942
If we could just get Karacahisar,

38:13.822 --> 38:15.702
we can rush over to Sogut...

38:17.142 --> 38:19.502
and raise our own flag there.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.502
Why in Sogut, sir?

38:28.302 --> 38:30.302
Sogut is the center
of everything, Artuk Bey.

38:31.302 --> 38:34.302
He who rules Sogut rules the future.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.942
Our light shall light
the darkness of the night.

38:41.782 --> 38:43.582
As long as we don't fall into disarray.

38:48.022 --> 38:51.262
As long as we don't become desperate.

38:56.982 --> 38:58.182
What about Turgut Alp, sir?

38:59.302 --> 39:02.022
He's invaluable to us.
He's our commander.

39:02.942 --> 39:04.102
Yet he sides with the enemy.

39:04.702 --> 39:07.742
If he's the man I know he must be
playing a game, Artuk Bey.

39:08.862 --> 39:10.822
Or I'd have had his life
right there and then.

39:14.662 --> 39:19.422
I can overlook anything, Artuk Bey.
But not betrayal.

39:22.422 --> 39:24.982
{\an8}HANLI BAZAAR

39:32.182 --> 39:35.542
I want you to know that you
are not a burden on me, or on my brother.

39:39.302 --> 39:41.622
You stayed by my side
for days on end, Maria...

39:43.502 --> 39:45.582
but I have no wish
to burden you any longer.

39:46.982 --> 39:48.742
I must leave no later than tomorrow.

39:50.262 --> 39:51.342
Where will you go?

39:52.662 --> 39:54.862
You turned your back on your tribe,
you have no one.

39:57.022 --> 39:59.622
Don't worry, I can fend for myself.

40:01.062 --> 40:02.102
I spoke to my brother.

40:03.342 --> 40:06.702
He said you could work for him,
if you wanted to.

40:08.222 --> 40:11.662
He needs a good warrior
such as yourself.

40:13.022 --> 40:13.982
Maria...

40:15.302 --> 40:16.422
I'm a warrior.

40:17.022 --> 40:17.982
An Alp.

40:18.942 --> 40:20.862
It's all I know.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.702
How could I be of use to
a great merchant like Simon?

40:23.902 --> 40:25.222
There are bandits everywhere.

40:26.702 --> 40:28.502
They keep extorting us.

40:29.142 --> 40:30.822
Problems occur when we make collections.

40:31.142 --> 40:34.342
Bandits that have found out
we've been collecting raid us.

40:34.782 --> 40:37.142
They steal our gold, murder our men.

40:37.262 --> 40:40.102
So, in short, trade is a war
in and of itself, Maria Hatun.

40:46.262 --> 40:50.382
Please stay.
I don't want you to get hurt.

40:52.142 --> 40:53.222
I appreciate the sentiment.

40:59.702 --> 41:01.142
I shall stay a while longer.

41:08.382 --> 41:11.982
My brother will be very happy.
Let me go tell him.

41:13.342 --> 41:14.422
Good night.

41:15.662 --> 41:16.622
Good night.

45:48.782 --> 45:51.342
So, this is the doorway to Hell
you've been using.

46:59.782 --> 47:02.462
Master Simon, the news you were
expecting from Konya has come.

47:02.822 --> 47:04.662
-It's Ebu Nakkas.
-What does he say?

47:05.062 --> 47:08.662
He says it's time.
He's waiting for you at the usual place.

47:10.662 --> 47:14.622
-What about Turgut?
-He agreed to work for you.

47:15.222 --> 47:18.102
Good. You and Philip shall train him.

47:19.022 --> 47:20.622
Tomorrow, he joins the first collection.

47:20.942 --> 47:23.462
-Learn the ropes.
-As you wish, Master Simon.

48:49.582 --> 48:51.862
The spy in Konya is Ebu Nakkas.

48:55.182 --> 48:58.222
Who is he? Who?

49:01.782 --> 49:03.862
{\an8}CAVDAR TRIBE

49:28.742 --> 49:29.742
Thank you, sister.

49:46.702 --> 49:49.022
In the name of God...

49:53.102 --> 49:54.062
Here, my son.

49:57.262 --> 49:58.222
Here, my girl.

49:59.382 --> 50:00.862
<i>Bismillah</i>.

50:12.462 --> 50:14.102
We must win over Ertuğrul Bey...

50:15.422 --> 50:18.622
and become stronger,
that's the only way forward for us.

50:19.942 --> 50:23.342
The path to China from Constantinople
passes through these lands, Father.

50:24.662 --> 50:26.222
If we rule over these lands

50:26.662 --> 50:30.222
we rule over the gold,
and thus, dominate everything.

50:30.822 --> 50:32.782
All we need is stability.

50:34.502 --> 50:39.502
These lands will be free of disorder
thanks to you, Father.

50:40.862 --> 50:41.822
You are right.

50:43.702 --> 50:46.182
Only we can provide stability.

50:46.822 --> 50:52.022
However, we must first ensure
unity among ourselves.

50:53.422 --> 50:56.342
Much depends on you two.

50:57.902 --> 51:02.982
Don't take your eyes off Ural,
or his wife, Çolpan.

51:04.742 --> 51:09.142
Any mistake they make could be
disastrous and lead to our destruction.

51:11.462 --> 51:17.102
Don't worry, Father.
We'll do whatever is necessary.

51:18.542 --> 51:21.902
-Sir, may I enter?
-Come in, Batuhan.

51:53.742 --> 51:56.942
-You called for me, sir?
-Tell me, Batuhan.

51:58.582 --> 52:02.342
Is your master Ural Bey
up to anything?

52:03.142 --> 52:06.342
You tied his hand and foot, sir.
I'm watching him.

52:08.622 --> 52:13.182
When he makes a mistake
you know what to do.

52:13.622 --> 52:15.222
I'll tell you first, sir.

52:17.822 --> 52:18.782
Go now.

52:21.422 --> 52:22.422
Batuhan.

52:24.862 --> 52:27.342
If you forget my words...

52:29.582 --> 52:31.182
I'll cut your ears off.

52:53.702 --> 52:55.742
First, he used Batuhan's knife.

52:57.222 --> 52:59.262
Then, he made a deal with Ertuğrul.

53:00.022 --> 53:02.342
Simon is behind all of this.

53:13.262 --> 53:18.302
He's a merchant, sir.
His god is gold, his prayers, trade.

53:19.022 --> 53:23.982
-Why would he do it?
-I'll find out, Çolpan. I will find out.

53:25.182 --> 53:26.782
Keep your eyes open at the bazaar.

53:27.942 --> 53:31.502
I need to know every step
Halime and Aslıhan take.

53:31.742 --> 53:33.142
Don't worry.

53:33.702 --> 53:36.702
They won't take a step
in the market without me knowing.

53:37.062 --> 53:38.622
May I enter, sir?

53:40.142 --> 53:41.342
Come in, Batuhan.

53:55.742 --> 53:57.102
You know what to do?

53:59.102 --> 54:01.022
Depart at sunrise.

54:03.022 --> 54:05.902
-Amanda is waiting.
-Yes, sir.

54:07.342 --> 54:08.302
What did my father say?

54:09.222 --> 54:11.862
If I ignore his words
and not inform on you

54:12.542 --> 54:14.102
he'll cut my ears off, sir.

54:19.742 --> 54:21.062
Batuhan.

54:22.422 --> 54:24.142
You're not afraid of him, are you?

54:25.382 --> 54:28.102
Sir, you took me in
when I lost my parents.

54:28.942 --> 54:30.422
You brought me up as a warrior.

54:31.342 --> 54:35.622
I was trained to give my life for you.
And I shall die only for you.

54:41.022 --> 54:43.462
I'll not forget your devotion, Batuhan.

55:24.582 --> 55:25.662
Let me see.

55:37.902 --> 55:39.022
Thanks, here.

56:06.342 --> 56:10.102
If you're playing tricks on me,
I'll carve your eyes out, Amanda.

56:21.262 --> 56:22.502
There's 100 gold coins inside.

56:25.582 --> 56:26.422
What's this for?

56:27.422 --> 56:30.702
Down payment for what you are about to do.

56:32.022 --> 56:33.942
You'll receive 200 more afterwards.

56:35.302 --> 56:37.382
I'd like to know who I'm serving.

56:38.582 --> 56:43.462
Let's say an influential client.
I can't disclose his identity.

56:45.382 --> 56:48.822
If I don't get my money,
I'll find you, Amanda.

56:49.862 --> 56:53.622
You know where to find me
if you don't get paid.

57:03.822 --> 57:05.142
What do I have to do?

57:08.102 --> 57:08.942
Come with me.

57:37.582 --> 57:39.662
Here is how you get your gold.

57:45.822 --> 57:47.302
I hate Turks.

57:49.062 --> 57:50.502
That's why you were chosen for this.

57:53.142 --> 57:54.662
Welcome, Halime Sultan.

57:57.022 --> 57:58.182
May this be fruitful for all.

57:58.862 --> 58:01.982
Thank you. We too hope
everything goes well, Aslıhan Hatun.

58:07.902 --> 58:08.862
They want you to...

58:10.062 --> 58:13.062
kidnap Aslıhan Hatun and Halime Sultan.

58:13.862 --> 58:14.702
Who are they?

58:15.982 --> 58:18.222
Aslıhan Hatun is the daughter
of Cavdar Bey.

58:19.462 --> 58:23.422
Halime Sultan is the wife
of Ertuğrul, Bey of Kayis.

58:24.822 --> 58:26.662
The niece of Sultan Alaeddin?

58:27.742 --> 58:28.742
The very same.

58:31.462 --> 58:34.102
I hope our partnership proves fruitful.

58:35.342 --> 58:38.582
If the wishes are sincere,
the outcome shall prove positive.

58:42.262 --> 58:44.822
-Come in, everyone.
-Go on, women.

58:46.502 --> 58:48.022
It's up to you, Francisco.

58:49.422 --> 58:52.942
Find out how many guards there are
and which routes they take.

58:54.062 --> 58:56.342
And prevent them from
coming to the market tomorrow.

58:57.102 --> 58:59.662
Circle the weaving house.

59:00.222 --> 59:01.222
Don't let anyone in.

59:02.142 --> 59:05.382
Go. Go. Wonderful!

59:07.062 --> 59:08.302
It should be done tomorrow.

59:46.022 --> 59:48.222
-Banu Cicek Hatun.
-Yes.

59:49.222 --> 59:51.582
Are you responsible for
the weaving house as well?

59:51.862 --> 59:54.462
-Of course, Bamsi Bey.
-Praise be.

59:55.342 --> 59:58.262
I have a matter to attend to.
Then I'll be back.

00:59:58.662 --> 01:00:00.942
Go, get it done. Don't worry about us.

01:00:01.102 --> 01:00:02.982
-Right.
-Go on.

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:47.782
<i>Bismillah</i>.

01:00:48.982 --> 01:00:49.942
<i>Bismillah.</i>

01:00:53.382 --> 01:00:55.182
The women are ready, Halime Sultan.

01:01:04.342 --> 01:01:07.622
Earnest women of Cavdar
and Kayi tribes...

01:01:09.262 --> 01:01:14.862
From now on, the rugs, our very own work,
will reach the whole world.

01:01:15.822 --> 01:01:18.142
And if it's blessed,
it shall bring us a fortune.

01:01:18.782 --> 01:01:22.422
As long as we work together,
these looms won't lie idle,

01:01:22.742 --> 01:01:26.182
and our tribes will know no hunger.

01:01:26.702 --> 01:01:27.662
God willing.

01:01:29.382 --> 01:01:32.942
It's time we worked as one, and honestly.

01:01:34.462 --> 01:01:38.382
May God honor his name,
and bestow us with prosperity.

01:01:38.582 --> 01:01:40.262
Amen.

01:01:41.102 --> 01:01:45.822
Aslıhan and Çolpan Hatun will
deal with any problems you might have.

01:01:47.422 --> 01:01:52.702
-Congratulations on our first day here.
-Amen.

01:01:53.422 --> 01:01:54.622
Get to work now.

01:02:08.582 --> 01:02:10.902
Just like her husband, Ertuğrul.

01:02:14.622 --> 01:02:16.942
Courage is in their blood, it seems.

01:02:17.862 --> 01:02:20.502
And you and your husband keep losing.

01:02:24.502 --> 01:02:29.022
The war has just begun, Maria.
You don't know the Turks yet.

01:02:34.222 --> 01:02:39.142
I heard that
you are about to fall for a Turk.

01:02:41.902 --> 01:02:42.862
Yes.

01:02:44.222 --> 01:02:46.582
I wouldn't believe
the things you tell me...

01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:49.302
unless I convert.

01:02:56.982 --> 01:02:57.822
Welcome.

01:02:59.822 --> 01:03:01.582
May I know who our guest is?

01:03:02.582 --> 01:03:05.422
I'm Maria, the sister
of the owner of this bazaar.

01:03:07.302 --> 01:03:10.782
I'd like to invite you brave women
who have brought life to this market

01:03:11.222 --> 01:03:12.822
over for dinner.

01:03:13.862 --> 01:03:15.542
I'd like to welcome you to the market

01:03:15.622 --> 01:03:18.102
on behalf of Innkeeper Simon
and the other merchants.

01:03:31.742 --> 01:03:33.262
Greetings, brother.

01:03:39.462 --> 01:03:40.422
Turgut, brother.

01:03:42.782 --> 01:03:45.102
You must miss the food of your home.

01:03:46.582 --> 01:03:48.662
I brought you food from home.

01:03:50.422 --> 01:03:53.262
There is only food for heathens here.

01:04:03.342 --> 01:04:04.302
Enough.

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:10.262
Leave me alone.

01:04:13.422 --> 01:04:17.822
Brother, what's wrong with you?
How long will you keep running?

01:04:21.222 --> 01:04:25.182
Brother, I miss fighting with you,
back to back.

01:04:26.102 --> 01:04:29.982
Riding horse with you until they tremble.

01:04:31.222 --> 01:04:34.342
Everything was great when
we were still together with our brothers.

01:04:34.942 --> 01:04:37.982
When they were still alive
and not buried six feet under.

01:04:39.622 --> 01:04:40.862
Turgut, brother!

01:04:55.902 --> 01:04:57.982
You made a fool out of a Kayis...

01:04:59.622 --> 01:05:01.382
in front of this scum.

01:05:03.182 --> 01:05:04.982
You deserve a whipping now.

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:07.142
Go away, Bamsi! Go away!

01:05:09.902 --> 01:05:11.822
Fight! Fight!

01:05:12.862 --> 01:05:15.262
Fight!

01:05:16.142 --> 01:05:17.102
Fight!

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:34.342
Let me go!

01:05:35.502 --> 01:05:37.182
-Let me go! You scum!
-Enough!

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.982
I won't tolerate
fighting in my inn, Bamsi.

01:05:43.502 --> 01:05:45.982
Turgut works for us now.
Stop causing trouble.

01:05:49.142 --> 01:05:52.942
Turgut, join the collections
with Maria and Philip.

01:05:56.182 --> 01:06:00.022
Apparently, Kayis won't leave you alone
unless they see that you work for us.

01:06:21.062 --> 01:06:24.342
You serve this scum now?

01:06:29.222 --> 01:06:30.902
Pity, you were a brave man.

01:08:08.601 --> 01:08:10.841
Right, brother. Right.

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:15.721
You were trying to tell me something,
but this half-wit Bamsi didn't get it.

01:08:16.201 --> 01:08:17.441
Good man.

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:19.481
Well done, my brother.

01:08:21.081 --> 01:08:23.881
Thank you for your kind offer, Lady Maria.

01:08:24.721 --> 01:08:27.201
We always come here prepared,

01:08:29.761 --> 01:08:32.681
but then, it is against our traditions
to refuse anything offered to us.

01:08:33.161 --> 01:08:36.521
But we must first set up our stands
and put everything in order.

01:08:37.761 --> 01:08:42.001
Very well, Lady Halime.
I'll be at the inn if you need anything.

01:08:44.641 --> 01:08:45.641
Good luck.

01:08:56.801 --> 01:08:58.321
Lady Aslıhan, Lady Çolpan.

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:01.201
We need to assign the patterns
to the women.

01:09:02.321 --> 01:09:03.921
You're right, Lady Halime.

01:09:04.321 --> 01:09:07.041
But we need to discuss what happens next.

01:09:07.441 --> 01:09:08.681
This is our opportunity

01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:13.041
to get our beautiful Turkish patterns
into palaces all over the world.

01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:16.561
Our customers are Franks, Lady Aslıhan.

01:09:16.761 --> 01:09:19.001
They don't like Turkish designs.

01:09:21.081 --> 01:09:24.881
Let them get used to it.
It'll get them used to seeing us.

01:09:26.681 --> 01:09:29.521
We will conquer their palaces
with our rugs for now,

01:09:31.241 --> 01:09:35.281
then our brave men like Ertuğrul Bey
can conquer them with their swords.

01:09:45.601 --> 01:09:49.841
Let's leave them do their work.

01:09:54.161 --> 01:09:55.361
And we'll do ours.

01:09:59.521 --> 01:10:01.641
The patterns need to be ready tomorrow.

01:10:03.441 --> 01:10:07.401
If we work through the night
we'll have them ready easily enough.

01:10:08.561 --> 01:10:11.481
I need to leave early,
there is a council meeting tonight.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:15.721
If you wish,
Lady Aslıhan can go with you.

01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:20.441
Then you can work through the night.
We do need to have those goods ready.

01:10:23.921 --> 01:10:25.521
She is more than welcome.

01:10:27.801 --> 01:10:31.641
My father doesn't know about it.
I can't, I'm sorry.

01:10:33.001 --> 01:10:34.241
I'll let him know, Aslıhan.

01:10:35.041 --> 01:10:38.161
We need to work day and night
if we're going to get the goods ready.

01:10:38.361 --> 01:10:41.161
We'll be a lot quicker if
we prepare the patterns tonight.

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:42.521
Right, Lady Halime?

01:10:44.401 --> 01:10:45.721
You are right, Lady Çolpan.

01:10:47.681 --> 01:10:52.681
Very well, then. The Kayi tribe
will host sister Aslıhan tonight.

01:10:53.761 --> 01:10:55.041
And who knows,

01:10:55.361 --> 01:11:00.681
maybe a good fellow from the tribe
will see Lady Aslıhan and fall for her.

01:11:17.361 --> 01:11:18.561
What's up, Bamsi Alp?

01:11:19.881 --> 01:11:21.921
Still haven't given up on Turgut?

01:11:23.841 --> 01:11:27.041
I have. I have given up on that traitor.

01:11:27.401 --> 01:11:28.841
I don't care about him.

01:11:30.361 --> 01:11:32.401
He is a donkey.

01:11:33.161 --> 01:11:35.601
You can have him,
do what you want with him.

01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:37.481
I'll take my leave.

01:11:41.441 --> 01:11:45.321
I knew my brother wouldn't turn on us.

01:11:45.881 --> 01:11:46.841
Yeah...

01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:50.841
I got a little dizzy
after that punch, though.

01:11:51.721 --> 01:11:52.681
But it's okay.

01:11:54.921 --> 01:11:57.281
His hand is a like a rock, bless him.

01:11:58.841 --> 01:12:02.841
Yeah! Ertuğrul Bey
will be very happy with this news.

01:12:22.841 --> 01:12:27.201
<i>Grand Master,</i>
<i>Ebu Nakkas has contacted me.</i>

01:12:27.881 --> 01:12:29.761
<i>The long-awaited moment is coming.</i>

01:12:32.841 --> 01:12:36.361
<i>I'm putting into action a plan to set the</i>
<i>Turks in the region against each other.</i>

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:39.361
<i>I will expect your orders.</i>

01:13:33.161 --> 01:13:37.841
Ertuğrul Bey, I thank God
for granting me the opportunity

01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:40.641
to repay my debt to you
before taking my life.

01:13:42.241 --> 01:13:45.481
The sand in the riverbed
is rich with gold.

01:13:47.441 --> 01:13:52.321
The gold was unaffected by the storm
because it is heavier

01:13:53.201 --> 01:13:56.641
than both rock and sand.
It resisted the tide.

01:13:57.281 --> 01:13:59.881
It remains hidden amongst
the sand on the river bed.

01:14:00.681 --> 01:14:05.361
Our task is to remove it
and carefully sift through the sand.

01:14:07.881 --> 01:14:10.281
There is a cave on the banks of the river.

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:15.681
I would like to sift
the sand in that cave.

01:14:16.401 --> 01:14:20.401
It'd be safer that way.
Do I have your permission?

01:14:21.561 --> 01:14:23.881
Do what you think best, master.

01:14:24.841 --> 01:14:27.921
Get that gold ready to fill our pockets.

01:14:28.801 --> 01:14:30.361
As you command, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:14:30.601 --> 01:14:35.241
But the river is deeper
and the current stronger than I thought.

01:14:35.601 --> 01:14:37.001
We'll need some tools.

01:14:38.081 --> 01:14:40.561
Get whatever you need from the bazaar.

01:14:41.241 --> 01:14:43.441
But make haste.
The council is meeting tonight.

01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:45.681
Yes, sir.

01:14:54.641 --> 01:14:57.121
My Bey. My Ertuğrul Bey.

01:14:59.081 --> 01:15:00.841
Come in, Bamsi, what is it?

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:05.561
My Bey. I went to see Turgut.

01:15:06.721 --> 01:15:09.201
It seems that he was faking everything.

01:15:12.321 --> 01:15:16.841
He hit me pretty hard, but I'm okay.

01:15:18.361 --> 01:15:22.561
Bey, look. Look what he hid in here.

01:15:39.241 --> 01:15:41.241
It's an encrypted message, Bey.

01:15:47.521 --> 01:15:51.201
But I trust that, with this tool,
it will be easy enough to decipher.

01:15:54.241 --> 01:15:56.281
I told you I knew my alp.

01:16:00.561 --> 01:16:02.001
This letter

01:16:03.281 --> 01:16:06.921
leaves me in no doubt
that Simon is John the Baptist.

01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:29.441
This was a productive day, Lady Halime.

01:16:29.721 --> 01:16:31.521
We've already made a lot of progress.

01:16:32.441 --> 01:16:35.761
You're right.
The women of the tribe are good at this.

01:16:38.921 --> 01:16:40.881
Sorry to interrupt your chit-chat.

01:16:43.441 --> 01:16:44.961
But the women are tired.

01:16:46.281 --> 01:16:47.841
And we should be on the road.

01:16:49.081 --> 01:16:53.241
Let's call it a day, Lady Çolpan.
We can continue tomorrow.

01:16:53.681 --> 01:16:56.961
Let's get things ready so that
we can get on the road before dark.

01:16:58.121 --> 01:17:01.921
I'll let your father know that you'll be
with the Kayi Tribe tonight, Aslıhan.

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.401
Don't worry about that.

01:17:05.441 --> 01:17:08.161
We have some hard work
ahead of us tonight.

01:17:08.761 --> 01:17:10.961
I don't want to be a burden on you.

01:17:11.121 --> 01:17:13.281
Nonsense, it will be an honor.

01:17:22.801 --> 01:17:27.361
Dedicated women of our tribes,
thank you for your efforts.

01:17:28.281 --> 01:17:32.681
You have done fine work
stitching the patterns of our ancestors.

01:17:34.441 --> 01:17:37.481
Now it's time to go home.

01:17:39.001 --> 01:17:41.001
-Come on.
-Let's go.

01:17:52.561 --> 01:17:54.801
<i>We'll take care of it if you like it.</i>

01:17:57.601 --> 01:17:59.881
Let's have a look at that one.

01:18:16.481 --> 01:18:19.081
The scent of pine doesn't suit you,
my lady.

01:18:20.201 --> 01:18:24.761
The doors and windows of the church
I used to attend were made of pine.

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:27.841
This scent took me back to those days.

01:18:30.201 --> 01:18:32.401
I haven't visited a church
since my marriage.

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:35.361
May God forgive me.

01:18:36.241 --> 01:18:38.561
Scent is a very powerful
stimulant, my lady.

01:18:39.241 --> 01:18:43.641
I'd suggest this one for you.
Give it a try.

01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:47.121
-What is it?
-Musk.

01:18:47.801 --> 01:18:49.921
It's found in the skin of the male deer.

01:18:50.201 --> 01:18:51.601
It is a scent for the evening.

01:18:51.841 --> 01:18:55.001
It is preferred by women
who want to impress their men.

01:19:06.601 --> 01:19:08.081
What are you doing here, wife?

01:19:12.561 --> 01:19:16.041
I like to smell good for my Bey.
That's all.

01:19:18.481 --> 01:19:19.601
My Ural.

01:19:21.521 --> 01:19:23.201
What are you doing here?

01:19:24.561 --> 01:19:28.321
Doing what a Bey does at the bazaar.

01:19:30.161 --> 01:19:31.721
The sun is about to set.

01:19:32.721 --> 01:19:34.761
Why are you not yet on the road?

01:19:34.921 --> 01:19:37.281
We're leaving now, brother.

01:19:38.001 --> 01:19:39.561
I have something to say to you.

01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:42.681
Go ahead Aslıhan, what is it?

01:19:43.761 --> 01:19:49.241
I am going to stay the night with
the Kayi tribe as a guest of Lady Halime.

01:19:49.361 --> 01:19:52.201
We need to keep working
to get the goods ready for tomorrow.

01:20:00.321 --> 01:20:01.681
Of course, Aslıhan.

01:20:05.201 --> 01:20:09.041
We are now fraternal tribes.
They are like our family.

01:20:24.721 --> 01:20:26.761
My Bey, Lady Aslıhan...

01:20:27.321 --> 01:20:30.081
-If she's with that caravan--
-Batuhan.

01:20:30.721 --> 01:20:34.481
If she is with them,
then no one will suspect us.

01:20:41.681 --> 01:20:42.881
Oh my.

01:20:46.161 --> 01:20:49.361
That man is still alive?
I thought he was dead.

01:20:51.161 --> 01:20:52.881
He has a life debt to me.

01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:54.881
How do you know him?

01:20:55.681 --> 01:20:58.121
He used to be a fine master
when it came to gold.

01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:02.001
When my father was a governor
he offered to extract gold for him.

01:21:02.281 --> 01:21:03.401
My father didn't accept.

01:21:04.441 --> 01:21:05.721
Gold?

01:21:09.641 --> 01:21:13.801
Ertuğrul must have a plan
if he has set that man free.

01:21:15.401 --> 01:21:16.361
Batuhan.

01:21:17.441 --> 01:21:20.441
Find out what he's doing at the market.

01:21:21.161 --> 01:21:22.281
What he buys or sells.

01:21:22.641 --> 01:21:23.641
Find out.

01:21:27.521 --> 01:21:29.161
So, Ertuğrul Bey...

01:21:30.401 --> 01:21:33.041
We'll find out your intentions eventually.

01:21:35.241 --> 01:21:38.121
Çolpan, don't be late.

01:21:38.601 --> 01:21:40.441
We have things to do tonight.

01:22:26.721 --> 01:22:29.281
I've never seen anything like this before.

01:22:30.041 --> 01:22:32.561
But I'm certain I'll be able
to figure it out tonight.

01:22:34.001 --> 01:22:37.001
I'm worried about the situation
my people are in, Artuk Bey.

01:22:37.401 --> 01:22:39.201
He must have taken this secretly.

01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:42.881
We need to get it back where
it was before it's missed. So hurry up.

01:22:43.921 --> 01:22:47.921
Don't worry, Bey. I'll do my best.

01:22:51.841 --> 01:22:53.641
-Good luck.
-Thank you, Bey.

01:23:00.721 --> 01:23:05.161
Bey, these men have built
their lives on cheating.

01:23:06.641 --> 01:23:08.641
Cheating is death to valor, Ishak.

01:23:09.281 --> 01:23:15.081
They think they can manipulate people into
doing what they want with these traps.

01:23:16.281 --> 01:23:20.441
What should we do in the face
of such traps, my Bey?

01:23:24.641 --> 01:23:27.161
By sticking to justice, sincerity,

01:23:27.561 --> 01:23:30.601
honesty, our values and our companions,

01:23:31.361 --> 01:23:33.921
we can break all these traps, Ishak.

01:23:34.921 --> 01:23:36.161
Well said, Bey.

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:52.521
My God, make our work fruitful.

01:23:53.081 --> 01:23:57.641
Help Mohammed's followers, my God.
Let us be at peace with each other.

01:23:58.681 --> 01:24:00.441
Disarm the traps set against us.

01:24:01.561 --> 01:24:05.121
Don't let our lawful livelihood be soiled
with that which is forbidden.

01:24:08.681 --> 01:24:11.401
-May God accept your prayers.
-Amen, Bey.

01:24:17.401 --> 01:24:19.241
-How is business?
-Thank God, not bad.

01:24:20.001 --> 01:24:21.561
I'm satisfied with today's income.

01:24:22.721 --> 01:24:26.001
We make our earnings by following
the ways of the blessed Muhammed.

01:24:27.161 --> 01:24:30.561
And we are happy to see traders like you
who make their earnings in halal ways.

01:24:31.761 --> 01:24:33.241
Yes, you can be happy, Bey.

01:24:33.881 --> 01:24:35.001
Yes, you can be happy...

01:24:35.441 --> 01:24:38.441
yet you do business
with a Christian like Simon.

01:24:41.641 --> 01:24:43.481
Yet we gave you the skins we had.

01:24:45.161 --> 01:24:46.441
And I'm grateful, Bey.

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:50.441
But be wary of Simon.

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:55.921
-Why?
-Simon is after you.

01:24:56.481 --> 01:25:00.281
He seeks to ally himself with us
so that he can grow stronger.

01:25:01.001 --> 01:25:04.161
He's the sort of man who gives one
and wants ten back in return.

01:25:05.721 --> 01:25:08.521
Haven't you just described all traders?

01:25:09.281 --> 01:25:11.161
Simon doesn't just get what he wants...

01:25:12.001 --> 01:25:13.801
he destroys his allies, too.

01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:17.241
I just wanted to warn you, Bey.

01:25:21.361 --> 01:25:23.521
Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah....

01:25:25.001 --> 01:25:27.321
buries his enemies deep in the ground.

01:25:46.201 --> 01:25:47.161
Thank you.

01:25:48.001 --> 01:25:52.961
My Bey, Lady Aslıhan has come with us.
There is some work that needs to be done.

01:25:53.921 --> 01:25:55.441
Very well, Lady Halime.

01:25:57.041 --> 01:26:00.881
We are to have a feast tonight.
You are fortunate, Lady Aslıhan.

01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:02.801
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:26:03.921 --> 01:26:05.961
Thank you for hosting me.

01:26:13.441 --> 01:26:15.481
Come now. We have things to do.

01:26:16.241 --> 01:26:19.161
Welcome to our tribe, Lady Aslıhan.
Please.

01:26:40.601 --> 01:26:41.921
Since I was a child,

01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:46.041
I've done everything I could
to make him love me.

01:26:47.761 --> 01:26:48.721
But he...

01:26:50.041 --> 01:26:52.241
has always treated me like a stepson.

01:26:57.441 --> 01:27:02.521
He is so cruel that he is incapable
of genuinely loving any of his children.

01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:04.281
It's not you.

01:27:04.881 --> 01:27:07.721
It is me, my Çolpan. Only me.

01:27:09.361 --> 01:27:12.881
He trusts Aliyar completely. Aslıhan, too.

01:27:15.201 --> 01:27:18.121
He doesn't care that I exist.

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:22.881
I've suffered so much
because of this tribe.

01:27:24.841 --> 01:27:27.281
He seems not to care
about the hardship I've endured.

01:27:28.361 --> 01:27:30.761
He made
Aliyar responsible for the business...

01:27:31.601 --> 01:27:33.001
while he lost his mind in books.

01:27:34.241 --> 01:27:35.641
Don't worry, my Bey.

01:27:36.521 --> 01:27:39.321
Tomorrow's raid will bring
everyone to their senses.

01:27:42.281 --> 01:27:45.041
First, he'll lose Halime.

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:50.521
Then... his beloved daughter Aslıhan.

01:27:53.281 --> 01:27:58.001
Once we've taken control of the rug house,
it'll be Aliyar's turn.

01:28:02.601 --> 01:28:05.601
Once the things clouding
my father's mind are taken away

01:28:09.281 --> 01:28:11.201
he'll learn to trust me.

01:28:14.761 --> 01:28:15.921
And if he doesn't?

01:28:20.881 --> 01:28:21.841
Then...

01:28:24.801 --> 01:28:26.161
it'll be his turn.

01:28:39.321 --> 01:28:40.761
Which female servants were working

01:28:42.121 --> 01:28:43.881
on the day Toktamis Bey died, Kutluca?

01:28:46.481 --> 01:28:50.001
There were a lot of them, Bey.
Aybuke was in charge.

01:28:51.201 --> 01:28:52.561
Where is this Aybüke?

01:28:53.281 --> 01:28:56.001
Lady Çolpan sent her on an errand, Bey.

01:28:56.681 --> 01:28:58.281
She hasn't been around for a while.

01:29:15.641 --> 01:29:19.161
We need to find Aybüke, Kutluca.

01:29:19.881 --> 01:29:23.521
Don't worry, Bey.
I'll find whatever hole she's hiding in.

01:29:39.241 --> 01:29:40.201
Take a seat, Father.

01:29:55.961 --> 01:30:00.241
What's wrong, Father?
Why have you come here at this late hour?

01:30:02.121 --> 01:30:06.081
-It's Aslıhan, son.
-Has something happened to her?

01:30:06.681 --> 01:30:08.601
No, not yet.

01:30:09.721 --> 01:30:12.961
But... she can't go on like this.

01:30:16.201 --> 01:30:19.041
Aslıhan has been rebellious
ever since she was a young girl.

01:30:21.121 --> 01:30:23.361
Her honest and compassionate nature...

01:30:25.081 --> 01:30:26.961
has sometimes got her into difficulties.

01:30:28.321 --> 01:30:32.241
She'd never listen to me...
no matter how often I tried.

01:30:32.841 --> 01:30:35.841
She has always followed the path
she considered to be right.

01:30:37.841 --> 01:30:40.321
Everyone admired her beauty.

01:30:43.401 --> 01:30:48.321
All these years...
I never wanted her to be married.

01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:52.521
Do you want her married now, Father?

01:30:54.721 --> 01:30:57.481
-Yes.
-Do you have someone in mind?

01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:01.681
I don't want her to go far away.

01:31:02.881 --> 01:31:07.401
She'll find peace
by the side of a brave and strong Bey.

01:31:08.841 --> 01:31:11.361
The Kayi tribe is our neighbor.

01:31:12.761 --> 01:31:14.961
I say she'd make a fine bride...

01:31:16.041 --> 01:31:18.921
for the tribe of Kayi.

01:31:52.321 --> 01:31:53.961
He who says "be" and it is done...

01:31:54.441 --> 01:31:56.481
He who fills our hearts with faith,

01:31:56.601 --> 01:31:59.081
with the almighty God's 99 names.

01:32:01.161 --> 01:32:02.961
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:32:07.441 --> 01:32:10.041
We have been through hard times,

01:32:10.241 --> 01:32:13.081
but thankfully we've come
to earn our daily bread.

01:32:14.201 --> 01:32:18.281
Hopefully from now on,
our tribe will enjoy brighter days.

01:32:19.641 --> 01:32:23.921
May God make our peace
and blessings everlasting.

01:32:24.041 --> 01:32:25.361
Amen.

01:32:27.961 --> 01:32:29.121
Enjoy your meal.

01:32:47.761 --> 01:32:48.841
Thanks, brother.

01:33:15.921 --> 01:33:16.881
Bey...

01:33:18.201 --> 01:33:19.281
May I?

01:33:20.521 --> 01:33:21.481
Go ahead, Ishak.

01:33:34.161 --> 01:33:36.241
Bey, this is in Latin.

01:33:38.161 --> 01:33:39.161
Are you sure, Ishak?

01:33:42.681 --> 01:33:43.641
Ebu...

01:33:45.761 --> 01:33:46.881
Nakkas...

01:33:51.761 --> 01:33:52.721
will relieve...

01:33:54.401 --> 01:33:55.681
the Weeping Rock's suffering...

01:33:56.961 --> 01:33:58.641
on the first day...

01:34:02.641 --> 01:34:05.001
of...

01:34:07.921 --> 01:34:09.001
the...

01:34:11.801 --> 01:34:12.761
new month.

01:34:14.881 --> 01:34:17.801
How do you know Latin, Ishak?

01:34:18.241 --> 01:34:21.881
My Sheik Ibn-ul Arabi
wanted me to learn it.

01:34:22.321 --> 01:34:24.601
He said it might be useful
when the time comes.

01:34:25.161 --> 01:34:27.641
Hey, my lion. My lion!

01:34:28.041 --> 01:34:29.241
We've figured out the wretch.

01:34:29.721 --> 01:34:32.481
-Let's tell the Bey, huh?
-Let's do it, Bey.

01:34:37.521 --> 01:34:40.921
So, Ozan.
Go ahead and cleanse our souls.

01:34:53.401 --> 01:34:57.761
<i>Hay hay</i>

01:35:09.201 --> 01:35:13.521
<i>Here I am on the mountain top</i>

01:35:13.721 --> 01:35:17.921
<i>Summer is behind, winter is ahead</i>

01:35:18.001 --> 01:35:21.161
<i>Winter is ahead</i>

01:35:22.761 --> 01:35:27.121
<i>So it trembles in the lake</i>

01:35:27.201 --> 01:35:31.401
<i>Oh, words fall short</i>

01:35:31.521 --> 01:35:34.321
<i>Oh, words fall short</i>

01:35:36.041 --> 01:35:40.361
<i>Oh, words fall short</i>

01:35:40.521 --> 01:35:45.201
<i>Oh, words fall short</i>

01:36:12.001 --> 01:36:18.121
<i>Oh, hay!</i>

01:36:27.961 --> 01:36:32.281
<i>I am at my wit's end</i>

01:36:32.481 --> 01:36:36.641
<i>Let's send the foe to his glory</i>

01:36:36.761 --> 01:36:40.121
<i>To his glory, to his glory</i>

01:36:41.481 --> 01:36:45.561
<i>Down the road, to Ayvaz</i>

01:36:45.761 --> 01:36:52.641
<i>Ride at full gallop</i>

01:36:53.601 --> 01:36:54.561
<i>Hey!</i>

01:36:54.681 --> 01:36:59.001
<i>Ride at full gallop</i>

01:36:59.201 --> 01:37:03.841
<i>Ride at full gallop</i>

01:37:12.761 --> 01:37:16.601
<i>Hay hay!</i>

01:37:36.681 --> 01:37:40.881
<i>There's no cure, I will go blind</i>

01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:45.321
<i>Let me marry Pasha's sister</i>

01:37:45.441 --> 01:37:48.521
<i>Pasha's sister</i>

01:37:50.121 --> 01:37:54.321
<i>Draw your sword</i>

01:37:54.561 --> 01:38:01.561
<i>Behead the foe</i>

01:38:03.321 --> 01:38:07.521
<i>Behead the foe</i>

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:12.361
<i>Behead the foe</i>

01:38:14.801 --> 01:38:19.121
Aslıhan, my girl, it's time
for you to get married.

01:38:19.801 --> 01:38:21.641
The opportunity hasn't yet arisen.

01:38:22.361 --> 01:38:26.321
I will do as my elders see appropriate.

01:38:26.601 --> 01:38:28.801
Opportunity can co-exist
with your intentions, my girl.

01:38:29.121 --> 01:38:31.361
If you have a young valiant man
in your heart

01:38:32.041 --> 01:38:35.521
the opportunity
will present itself to you.

01:38:36.321 --> 01:38:41.481
You just need to have the intention.
Ask for a good man to take your hand.

01:38:43.361 --> 01:38:45.361
My mother is right, Lady Aslıhan.

01:38:45.921 --> 01:38:47.961
Keep your intentions good.

01:38:48.881 --> 01:38:51.641
Then God will provide you
with someone to love.

01:38:53.361 --> 01:38:55.721
Let's find a brave fellow
from our tribe for you.

01:39:02.201 --> 01:39:06.241
<i>There's no cure, I will go blind</i>

01:39:06.601 --> 01:39:10.641
<i>Let me marry Pasha's sister</i>

01:39:10.881 --> 01:39:15.121
<i>Let me marry Pasha's sister</i>

01:39:15.641 --> 01:39:19.801
<i>Draw your sword</i>

01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:24.321
<i>Behead the foe</i>

01:39:24.441 --> 01:39:27.561
<i>Behead the foe</i>

01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:28.721
<i>Hey!</i>

01:39:28.841 --> 01:39:33.001
<i>Behead the foe</i>

01:39:33.361 --> 01:39:36.121
<i>Behead the foe</i>

01:39:37.881 --> 01:39:42.041
<i>Behead the foe</i>

01:39:45.561 --> 01:39:47.761
Ishak deciphered the heathen's code, Bey.

01:39:49.041 --> 01:39:51.481
The situation is more complicated
than we thought.

01:39:52.641 --> 01:39:55.041
There's a spy in the sultan's palace.

01:39:55.441 --> 01:39:58.561
Simon will meet with the spy,
Ebu Nakkas, in the palace.

01:40:03.361 --> 01:40:06.321
So, the treachery has made its way
all the way to the sultan's palace.

01:40:08.041 --> 01:40:10.081
We need to learn his identity.

01:40:10.201 --> 01:40:13.401
Simon is going to meet the spy
at the Weeping Rock, Bey.

01:40:13.961 --> 01:40:15.801
We can learn it there.

01:40:18.521 --> 01:40:20.321
Take this back to Turgut, Dundar.

01:40:22.921 --> 01:40:25.801
He'll tell you if he has
discovered any new information.

01:40:26.761 --> 01:40:29.481
Tell Dumrul to go
to the Weeping Rock at once.

01:40:30.281 --> 01:40:33.161
Have him check the environment.
Observe the location.

01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:34.801
As you command, Bey.

01:40:37.041 --> 01:40:41.121
Dogan will go to the Weeping Rock
and find out who this villain is.

01:40:42.921 --> 01:40:45.161
We won't be able to protect the sultan...

01:40:47.881 --> 01:40:49.561
or these lands

01:40:50.161 --> 01:40:51.761
if we fail to discover his identity.

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:04.481
What do you expect Ebu Nakkas will propose
at the Weeping Rock, Master Simon?

01:41:08.161 --> 01:41:10.641
Nakkas won't make an offer
which isn't to his advantage.

01:41:11.761 --> 01:41:14.841
Whatever he proposes,
there'll be some benefit in it for him.

01:41:15.721 --> 01:41:16.761
The real question is...

01:41:18.121 --> 01:41:20.361
what's in it for us?

01:41:21.321 --> 01:41:25.721
The sultan's spy will probably be there.
I'll take the necessary precautions.

01:41:27.521 --> 01:41:32.161
My dear friend Philip...
what would we do without you?

01:41:33.601 --> 01:41:36.401
I want you to know
how much we appreciate your services.

01:41:38.241 --> 01:41:39.441
Right, Maria?

01:41:47.081 --> 01:41:49.081
The oldest worker at the inn!

01:41:49.961 --> 01:41:51.081
How is business Cazgir?

01:41:52.121 --> 01:41:54.681
Business is how you want it to be.

01:41:55.041 --> 01:41:57.881
Let me know if anything is wrong
so that I can make it right.

01:41:59.561 --> 01:42:02.001
This is exactly the kind of loyalty
and intelligence I look for.

01:42:04.321 --> 01:42:05.961
My dear brother Cazgir.

01:42:06.681 --> 01:42:10.881
Take the day off, enjoy yourself.
Drink all the wine you want.

01:42:11.361 --> 01:42:12.321
You deserve it.

01:42:13.041 --> 01:42:14.801
I don't drink while working, Simon.

01:42:15.281 --> 01:42:18.041
And I don't stop working
till closing time.

01:42:22.281 --> 01:42:26.801
His wisdom is too great
to fit into his physical shape.

01:42:35.481 --> 01:42:36.921
Appearances can be deceptive.

01:42:40.961 --> 01:42:43.601
You shouldn't trust anyone
without first knowing them very well.

01:42:53.241 --> 01:42:57.521
Look who's here.
You must be hungry.

01:42:58.481 --> 01:43:00.841
Have them prepare a meal for Turgut Bey.

01:43:02.201 --> 01:43:04.841
So, Turgut Alp. You are one of us, now.

01:43:05.921 --> 01:43:09.081
How did collecting go?
I hope it wasn't difficult for you.

01:43:15.561 --> 01:43:16.761
No, it wasn't.

01:43:18.881 --> 01:43:20.601
I gave the gold to Philip.

01:43:25.481 --> 01:43:27.241
You didn't mention that, Philip.

01:43:29.481 --> 01:43:30.641
There was no time, Simon.

01:43:35.801 --> 01:43:39.041
Anyway. Tomorrow will be a tough day.

01:43:40.281 --> 01:43:41.441
Enjoy your meal.

01:44:44.841 --> 01:44:46.441
And he is one day older...

01:44:52.321 --> 01:44:56.641
He spends his whole day trying
to become just like his father.

01:44:57.801 --> 01:44:59.881
His hand was never
without its wooden sword.

01:45:00.401 --> 01:45:04.001
Such a son is certainly worthy
of Ertuğrul Bey.

01:45:08.688 --> 01:45:10.088
I was going to suggest we have...

01:45:11.921 --> 01:45:15.441
the Seljuk emblem on the larger rugs.

01:45:16.681 --> 01:45:21.241
Maybe we can add images of birds
and the tree of life around the sides.

01:45:27.001 --> 01:45:30.641
-That'd be beautiful.
-And the earth-colored ones...

01:45:32.121 --> 01:45:33.961
can have the Kayi emblem on them.

01:45:35.121 --> 01:45:39.201
Images of wolves... or wolf prints.
It'll be very fitting.

01:45:41.521 --> 01:45:44.321
Maybe we can add eagles
at the corners as well.

01:45:45.001 --> 01:45:46.681
What will we use as a dye?

01:45:48.241 --> 01:45:53.041
Let's use buckthorn berries.
And barberry for the yellow.

01:45:55.241 --> 01:45:58.441
The flannel plant for green.

01:45:58.801 --> 01:46:00.361
I've seen some near here.

01:46:01.161 --> 01:46:04.721
Yes, but using the whole plant
would alter the tone of the green.

01:46:05.321 --> 01:46:08.841
It'll be a better green
if we use only the leaves.

01:46:09.561 --> 01:46:11.161
Very well, Halime Sultan.

01:46:11.801 --> 01:46:14.601
I can see the outcome
before we've even started, thanks to you.

01:46:20.481 --> 01:46:23.241
I remember the day
Lady Halime first came to the tribe.

01:46:25.321 --> 01:46:28.601
Lady Selcan and I could hardly
believe the things she suggested.

01:46:29.281 --> 01:46:33.441
But she somehow made it possible...

01:46:34.641 --> 01:46:37.201
by using all different herbs,

01:46:37.841 --> 01:46:40.401
and produced a variety of colors
we'd never even seen before.

01:46:40.721 --> 01:46:41.681
And that's not all.

01:46:42.521 --> 01:46:47.401
She came into our lives
just as my Suleyman Shah and I...

01:46:48.241 --> 01:46:51.001
were coming to terms with the idea that
Ertuğrul couldn't be tamed

01:46:52.241 --> 01:46:53.921
and would never give us grandchildren.

01:47:01.761 --> 01:47:03.001
I'm really glad she has.

01:47:04.681 --> 01:47:09.161
I hope God gives other mothers
a daughter-in-law like her.

01:47:09.361 --> 01:47:10.321
Mother...

01:47:13.601 --> 01:47:14.561
Amen.

01:47:23.881 --> 01:47:26.241
May God never take you from our side.

01:47:28.921 --> 01:47:30.081
My girl...

01:47:35.601 --> 01:47:41.201
I also hope God gives you someone
to embrace and love dearly.

01:47:41.721 --> 01:47:44.601
A brave and decent man.

01:47:45.161 --> 01:47:46.321
Amen, Mother Hayme.

01:47:52.441 --> 01:47:54.521
-Welcome, son.
-Thank you, Mother.

01:47:59.641 --> 01:48:01.921
-Welcome, Bey.
-Thank you, wife.

01:48:02.721 --> 01:48:03.681
Excuse me.

01:48:04.401 --> 01:48:08.041
As we must wake before the sun rises,
I'd better go to sleep.

01:48:08.601 --> 01:48:09.641
Goodnight.

01:48:10.801 --> 01:48:13.001
Have you put your business
in order, Lady Aslıhan?

01:48:13.601 --> 01:48:14.961
Thanks to Lady Halime...

01:48:16.121 --> 01:48:18.641
we are already halfway
towards finishing them.

01:48:21.321 --> 01:48:23.721
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

01:49:24.065 --> 01:49:25.545
Forgive me, God.

01:49:29.305 --> 01:49:30.785
What am I thinking of?

01:49:33.825 --> 01:49:35.465
What's going through my mind?

01:49:41.425 --> 01:49:43.785
Get him out of my heart, God.

01:49:46.705 --> 01:49:48.585
Don't exhaust me
with this incurable heartache.

01:50:19.145 --> 01:50:21.305
You seem as tense as a bow, Halime Sultan.

01:50:22.985 --> 01:50:24.465
Is something bothering you?

01:50:26.265 --> 01:50:29.185
I just want to do my job
in the best possible manner, my Bey.

01:50:30.585 --> 01:50:32.785
Thank God I have no other worries.

01:51:01.545 --> 01:51:05.465
Why, then, do I see
your beautiful brow so furrowed

01:51:05.625 --> 01:51:07.785
whenever you look at Lady Aslihan, Halime?

01:51:09.745 --> 01:51:11.145
Do you have something to tell me?

01:51:12.185 --> 01:51:13.145
Let me know.

01:51:19.185 --> 01:51:20.145
Mom...

01:51:21.545 --> 01:51:22.505
Water.

01:51:22.665 --> 01:51:23.865
Of course, my Gunduz.

01:51:27.585 --> 01:51:29.345
I'm not worried, my Bey. I'm fine.

01:51:56.705 --> 01:51:58.105
There you go, my boy.

01:52:18.065 --> 01:52:19.225
Good morning, Simon.

01:52:20.585 --> 01:52:21.705
You too, Turgut Alp.

01:52:24.385 --> 01:52:25.785
I'm not an Alp anymore.

01:52:26.665 --> 01:52:29.225
You will always be
a brave warrior in my eyes.

01:52:34.905 --> 01:52:35.825
What's up?

01:52:36.585 --> 01:52:37.865
Taking a long road?

01:52:38.905 --> 01:52:39.865
You could say that.

01:52:40.825 --> 01:52:42.825
I'm going to see an old friend of mine.

01:52:43.785 --> 01:52:45.225
I can accompany you if you wish.

01:52:47.025 --> 01:52:49.065
Thanks. I must go by myself.

01:52:50.745 --> 01:52:52.385
I heard you did very well yesterday.

01:52:53.585 --> 01:52:54.545
Take the day off.

01:52:55.465 --> 01:52:57.665
We'll have a lot to talk about
when I return.

01:52:58.865 --> 01:52:59.705
Very well.

01:53:13.865 --> 01:53:18.265
Bamsi. Don't you dare disappoint me,
you grizzly bear.

01:53:19.625 --> 01:53:21.025
Don't you do that.

01:53:32.425 --> 01:53:33.385
Take this one, too.

01:53:42.425 --> 01:53:44.625
If I have your permission,
I'll be on my way.

01:53:44.745 --> 01:53:46.345
I hope your trade went well, Hasan.

01:53:47.025 --> 01:53:48.025
Thanks to God.

01:53:48.305 --> 01:53:50.465
It was profitable for both parties.

01:53:51.585 --> 01:53:52.865
Appreciate it.

01:53:53.545 --> 01:53:55.625
You can come to my tribe
any time you wish.

01:53:55.825 --> 01:53:57.465
You don't need permission.

01:53:57.625 --> 01:53:58.905
Thank you, my Bey.

01:53:59.065 --> 01:54:00.065
I appreciate it.

01:54:00.185 --> 01:54:01.785
-Peace to you.
-Very well.

01:54:15.025 --> 01:54:15.985
Dad!

01:54:23.385 --> 01:54:26.745
Dad. Let me go to the bazaar with mom.

01:54:28.905 --> 01:54:31.065
-Do you really want to?
-Yes.

01:54:37.745 --> 01:54:40.145
Very well, then.
Take good care of your mom.

01:54:49.225 --> 01:54:51.305
Come and give a hug to this lady.

01:54:56.905 --> 01:54:57.865
Safe travels.

01:54:58.665 --> 01:54:59.705
Thanks, my Bey.

01:55:01.185 --> 01:55:02.545
-Mom.
-My girl...

01:55:04.545 --> 01:55:05.945
May God protect you.

01:55:09.985 --> 01:55:12.425
-Thanks, Mother.
-Go on, then.

01:55:24.785 --> 01:55:26.185
All good, ladies?

01:55:44.105 --> 01:55:45.065
My Bey.

01:55:47.185 --> 01:55:48.625
Dumrul is back from the mission.

01:55:49.345 --> 01:55:52.225
Artuk Bey and Dundar Bey
are waiting for you at their tent.

01:55:52.425 --> 01:55:53.305
Very well.

01:56:39.825 --> 01:56:41.425
I want those two women alive.

01:56:44.345 --> 01:56:46.265
I will make all of you pay

01:56:47.145 --> 01:56:49.145
if anything happens to them.

01:56:50.505 --> 01:56:51.625
Go to your positions.

01:57:07.505 --> 01:57:08.985
What have you learned, Dumrul?

01:57:09.185 --> 01:57:11.505
The Weeping Rock is surrounded
by trees, my Bey.

01:57:12.585 --> 01:57:15.385
It is sacred to the Greeks.

01:57:15.905 --> 01:57:18.425
They visit this place on their holy days.

01:57:19.905 --> 01:57:21.305
But why this place?

01:57:21.705 --> 01:57:25.305
No one goes there on the other days
because it is such an eerie place.

01:57:26.185 --> 01:57:28.785
It's a good place
to hold a secret meeting.

01:57:29.545 --> 01:57:32.745
We'll have them surrounded
if we get to the road now.

01:57:33.265 --> 01:57:34.265
No, Dundar.

01:57:35.385 --> 01:57:36.945
We may well fall into a trap.

01:57:38.905 --> 01:57:40.185
What's on your mind, my Bey?

01:57:41.065 --> 01:57:43.065
You shouldn't get into a hole

01:57:44.105 --> 01:57:45.945
if you don't know how to get out, Dundar.

01:57:46.745 --> 01:57:49.625
They won't go
to the Weeping Rock unguarded.

01:57:50.585 --> 01:57:54.505
After all, it is obvious that
they are expecting the spy from Konya.

01:57:56.105 --> 01:57:58.465
My Bey... How will we get there?

01:57:59.625 --> 01:58:02.225
By taking a road
no one will predict, Bamsi.

01:58:02.705 --> 01:58:04.265
We shall take this stream.

01:58:04.985 --> 01:58:08.065
We'll not only get to the hornet's nest
via this stream

01:58:08.265 --> 01:58:11.865
but we'll also escape up it
if anything bad happens.

01:58:13.905 --> 01:58:15.345
Now listen to me carefully.

01:58:15.785 --> 01:58:18.465
Explain to Doğan
everything that I explain to you.

01:58:23.105 --> 01:58:24.545
We'll take this stream.

01:58:25.345 --> 01:58:29.225
Coming down to the stream,
some of the Alps will go into the woods.

01:58:29.705 --> 01:58:33.185
I'm sure some of their men
will be positioned here.

01:58:44.265 --> 01:58:45.705
Where are the women of the tribe?

01:58:46.025 --> 01:58:47.225
On their way.

01:58:47.665 --> 01:58:48.865
They'll be here soon.

01:58:51.145 --> 01:58:52.345
What are you thinking, my Bey?

01:58:54.105 --> 01:58:57.585
None of this would be happening
if it wasn't for Toktamış Bey.

01:58:59.305 --> 01:59:02.985
That damned old man ruined everything
by breaking his promise to my father.

01:59:03.865 --> 01:59:04.825
First Aliyar,

01:59:05.585 --> 01:59:07.105
then Ertuğrul,

01:59:07.185 --> 01:59:09.105
and finally, Simon's hypocrisy.

01:59:09.585 --> 01:59:11.705
They'll all going to get
what they deserve, my Bey.

01:59:12.265 --> 01:59:14.065
So long as you stand your ground.

01:59:15.065 --> 01:59:18.025
Nobody's wife will be allowed to step
into the rug house

01:59:18.145 --> 01:59:19.985
for which we've fought.

01:59:21.345 --> 01:59:24.225
The partnership is over
before it even begins.

01:59:57.905 --> 01:59:59.225
Ladies, Alps...

01:59:59.745 --> 02:00:01.625
Let's stop here and take a little rest.

02:00:14.985 --> 02:00:16.265
<i>Bismillah.</i>

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:20.065
Thank you.

02:00:21.865 --> 02:00:22.705
Thanks.

02:00:23.105 --> 02:00:24.065
Come here.

02:00:25.265 --> 02:00:27.025
Come here, take a seat.

02:00:30.105 --> 02:00:31.425
Thank you, Banu Çiçek.

02:00:31.785 --> 02:00:32.745
Appreciate it.

02:00:54.025 --> 02:00:54.985
Right.

02:01:00.385 --> 02:01:01.305
Thank God.

02:01:06.945 --> 02:01:08.105
Roads tire people out.

02:01:09.305 --> 02:01:13.385
But the tiredness can be forgotten
if the destination

02:01:14.065 --> 02:01:15.545
is a warm home.

02:01:17.865 --> 02:01:19.665
-No, thanks.
-There you go.

02:01:20.025 --> 02:01:21.025
My sweetheart.

02:01:25.585 --> 02:01:27.585
You are very fortunate, Lady Halime.

02:01:27.865 --> 02:01:29.305
Thank God, I am.

02:01:30.465 --> 02:01:33.185
But nothing is easy, Lady Aslihan.

02:01:33.505 --> 02:01:36.385
We have paid a high price
to build our relationship.

02:01:39.265 --> 02:01:41.585
So why are you not married yet?

02:01:43.265 --> 02:01:44.545
We talked about it yesterday.

02:01:45.385 --> 02:01:48.425
I can help you marry someone
from the Kayi tribe, if you like.

02:01:49.625 --> 02:01:51.505
Since my mother passed away,

02:01:52.305 --> 02:01:54.825
I've never left my brother and dad alone.

02:01:56.345 --> 02:01:57.825
I've taken good care of them.

02:01:59.145 --> 02:02:01.265
Even if I were to marry someone

02:02:01.785 --> 02:02:05.065
I doubt my dad would allow me
to meet anyone outside our tribe.

02:02:07.705 --> 02:02:08.665
I see.

02:02:10.265 --> 02:02:12.905
Come on, ladies. Let's be on our way.

02:02:15.985 --> 02:02:17.145
Let's go.

02:02:17.745 --> 02:02:19.025
Take these, too.

02:02:19.145 --> 02:02:19.985
Watch the kids.

02:03:01.145 --> 02:03:03.305
Kids, come on.

02:03:06.105 --> 02:03:07.265
Alps!

02:03:07.945 --> 02:03:10.305
Hide the children! Hide them!

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:14.025
Ladies, be on guard!

02:03:47.905 --> 02:03:49.105
Jesus Christ!

02:03:50.065 --> 02:03:51.065
What the hell?

02:04:03.465 --> 02:04:04.425
Go!

02:04:53.105 --> 02:04:54.705
Gündüz!

02:04:59.025 --> 02:05:00.185
Gündüz!

02:05:09.065 --> 02:05:10.025
Gündüz!

02:05:12.105 --> 02:05:13.425
Everyone surrender!

02:05:13.745 --> 02:05:18.225
Or every woman will die,
starting with the wife of your Bey.

02:05:30.705 --> 02:05:31.585
Take them away.

02:06:08.785 --> 02:06:09.705
Gündüz.

02:06:11.305 --> 02:06:12.265
Gündüz.

02:06:13.065 --> 02:06:14.025
Gündüz.

02:06:14.585 --> 02:06:15.465
My lion.

02:06:54.545 --> 02:06:55.825
Someone is coming!

02:07:02.145 --> 02:07:03.665
Who is he, my Bey?

02:07:07.105 --> 02:07:08.065
Hasan the trader.

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:20.425
My Bey...

02:07:21.625 --> 02:07:24.385
Bandits attacked the women
going to the rug house.

02:07:24.785 --> 02:07:27.385
I rode my horse here to tell you
as soon as I saw.

02:07:28.465 --> 02:07:30.825
Gunkut, go to the tribe at once.

02:07:31.185 --> 02:07:33.185
Tell them what’s happened and get help.

02:07:33.465 --> 02:07:34.465
As you order, my Bey.

02:07:35.385 --> 02:07:37.745
Bamsi, you know what to do.

02:07:38.465 --> 02:07:40.465
Yes, my Bey. Very well.

02:07:41.545 --> 02:07:43.345
-Oh, God!
-Come on.

02:07:44.385 --> 02:07:45.385
-Go!
-Go!

02:07:45.545 --> 02:07:46.945
Come on, comrade!

02:08:36.985 --> 02:08:38.385
What do you want, Dundar?

02:08:38.785 --> 02:08:42.145
How many times do I have to tell you
I'm not coming back to the tribe?

02:08:42.865 --> 02:08:44.625
It was mentioned but I didn't believe it.

02:08:45.105 --> 02:08:45.945
So it is true!

02:08:47.585 --> 02:08:49.265
Brave Alp of our tribe, Turgut,

02:08:49.865 --> 02:08:51.785
betrayed his Bey and his tribe, huh?

02:09:02.385 --> 02:09:03.945
If there is a betrayal,

02:09:04.745 --> 02:09:06.025
I'm not the one guilty, Dündar.

02:09:15.505 --> 02:09:17.025
Shame on you, Turgut Alp.

02:09:17.985 --> 02:09:19.185
Shame on you!

02:10:59.625 --> 02:11:00.745
Where is your Bey, brother?

02:11:03.505 --> 02:11:05.025
He couldn't come, brother.

02:11:08.745 --> 02:11:11.305
What is it? Did something bad happen?

02:12:00.025 --> 02:12:01.905
Show your evil face already.

02:12:10.625 --> 02:12:11.465
My dear friend.

02:12:14.585 --> 02:12:16.665
I'm really happy to see you again.

02:12:17.825 --> 02:12:19.825
All the borders will be subject
to a change.

02:12:21.865 --> 02:12:22.985
We are now ready.

02:12:24.065 --> 02:12:25.705
If you give me what I want

02:12:26.625 --> 02:12:29.465
then we will both win.

02:12:31.105 --> 02:12:32.705
What would you have us do?

02:12:35.785 --> 02:12:37.665
Show your evil face already.

02:12:58.065 --> 02:12:58.945
Brother!

02:13:01.585 --> 02:13:02.545
Is there a problem?

02:13:04.665 --> 02:13:08.345
Bandits attacked our women
on their way to the rug house.

02:13:13.825 --> 02:13:14.825
But brother...

02:13:15.265 --> 02:13:17.225
our Bey has assigned this mission to us.

02:13:17.705 --> 02:13:19.465
Come on, brother.

02:13:19.785 --> 02:13:21.905
Let's take them down. Come on.

02:13:37.985 --> 02:13:40.385
That's as far as you get,
Sultan Aladdin's rats.

02:13:44.865 --> 02:13:47.585
-God is righteous!
-So God help me!

02:13:52.545 --> 02:13:53.465
Gündüz!

02:14:28.825 --> 02:14:33.385
My Bey. They abducted Lady Halime
and Lady Aslihan. We couldn't stop them.

02:14:44.665 --> 02:14:45.545
My Bey...

02:15:01.825 --> 02:15:02.785
Gündüz!

02:15:03.985 --> 02:15:04.945
Gündüz!

02:15:17.585 --> 02:15:18.865
Gündüz!

02:15:21.505 --> 02:15:22.425
Gündüz!

02:15:37.505 --> 02:15:41.265
Gündüz!
