WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 63 will start after 12:28 min.

15:43.133 --> 15:45.293
Brother? Are you all right?

15:47.013 --> 15:49.453
If not for my armor
I would have died, Marina.

15:50.053 --> 15:53.293
I'd have suffered eternally in Heaven
for not fulfilling my duty.

15:55.093 --> 15:56.933
Sultan Alaeddin's spy got away.

15:58.893 --> 16:04.173
We saw that he was not alone
and that we are surrounded by traitors.

16:04.653 --> 16:07.973
Did you see their faces? I didn't.

16:08.453 --> 16:11.253
We saw not their faces,
but what they are capable of.

16:12.573 --> 16:14.973
Even that is an important gain for us.

16:16.533 --> 16:17.893
But the knight got away.

16:19.773 --> 16:22.733
Don't worry. I got him.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.693
He won't make it with that arrow wound.

16:34.173 --> 16:36.013
You are my angel, Maria.

16:54.613 --> 16:55.613
Are you all right, my bey?

16:56.853 --> 16:58.733
I'm fine, Turgut. I'm fine.

17:25.173 --> 17:28.493
The devil Tristan
crushed him hard, my bey.

17:29.773 --> 17:31.413
This is not his doing, Turgut.

17:32.453 --> 17:34.773
He just finished him off.

17:39.693 --> 17:43.533
If they'd got all the information
out of the spy, we might have been saved.

17:45.413 --> 17:47.293
These spies are not easy to swallow.

17:48.173 --> 17:49.853
They stick to your throat.

17:53.613 --> 17:55.453
They did this because he didn't talk.

17:57.213 --> 17:59.453
So, our secret is still a secret.

18:01.013 --> 18:01.933
Agreed, my bey.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.453
<i>Bismillah.</i>

19:15.853 --> 19:18.013
What is that mark, my bey?

19:19.413 --> 19:20.813
It's the name of our enemy.

19:25.093 --> 19:26.213
Who, my bey?

19:27.053 --> 19:28.333
John the Baptist.

21:01.653 --> 21:05.093
God Almighty!
I am your servant, John the Baptist.

21:06.413 --> 21:08.253
Loyal servant of Jesus.

21:09.133 --> 21:13.093
I will be your son, Jesus' slave,
on my holy pilgrimage.

21:13.693 --> 21:19.493
I will take Jerusalem, the holy land
of our Virgin Mary, from the Muslims.

21:20.693 --> 21:23.573
I will rebuild Solomon's Temple.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.573
And Simon swore an oath to Jesus.

21:30.813 --> 21:35.853
My God, I will walk through dungeons
and die with you.

21:52.933 --> 21:55.653
{\an8}CAVDAR CAMP

22:04.413 --> 22:05.573
Step aside!

22:26.253 --> 22:29.493
Who did this? Who? How could they?

22:29.853 --> 22:31.653
Who did this?

22:36.453 --> 22:38.933
Don't let Toktamış Bey's death be in vain!

22:45.133 --> 22:48.333
What have they done to Toktamış?

22:48.413 --> 22:50.733
-Who?
-They will pay!

22:50.853 --> 22:54.973
His death won't be in vain!
Don't let Toktamış Bey's death be in vain!

22:55.133 --> 22:56.013
Don't!

23:10.693 --> 23:12.413
What a shame!

23:31.693 --> 23:34.333
Shut your mouths!

23:42.213 --> 23:45.373
Valiant warriors of the prairie!

23:49.253 --> 23:53.333
Bronze hearted lions of the Tatars!

23:55.773 --> 23:56.933
Last night...

23:58.213 --> 24:02.493
this infidel,
who treacherously attacked...

24:03.493 --> 24:06.573
our bey, our village...

24:08.173 --> 24:12.733
and its sons, has gotten

24:12.813 --> 24:16.093
what he deserved.

24:16.773 --> 24:21.813
While our Cavdar Bey fights heart and soul
so that our empire may grow,

24:22.213 --> 24:27.853
our empire may prosper
and become more fruitful, this dog...

24:29.493 --> 24:31.693
tried to stab him in the back.

24:32.973 --> 24:36.733
He who attacks our Candar Bey's marquee

24:37.453 --> 24:39.493
will die a horrible death.

24:40.493 --> 24:46.413
This dog that attacked Candar Bey
will hang here to set an example.

24:47.053 --> 24:51.053
Enemies of our people
will see their fate in his eyes.

25:48.693 --> 25:54.973
When jackals ambushed me
in the caves of the prairie...

25:55.933 --> 25:57.333
he gave everything he had.

25:58.613 --> 26:04.613
We swore to be blood brothers
in the shadow of great sycamores.

26:06.893 --> 26:10.333
We warded off Azrael in many a battle.

26:13.533 --> 26:16.693
I went on to wage war...

26:17.413 --> 26:20.933
leaving my wife and kids in his care.

26:23.253 --> 26:25.173
How could he...

26:26.853 --> 26:28.333
betray me like this?

26:32.053 --> 26:33.253
Give me your hands, Father.

26:35.213 --> 26:37.333
They say you were born in sin.

26:43.693 --> 26:49.293
I wish the ground had broken and the sky
had fallen, just so this wouldn't happen.

26:51.333 --> 26:54.173
This betrayal as I am getting ready
to part with this world...

26:55.213 --> 26:57.613
has taken away all my life, my dear.

27:00.213 --> 27:03.413
Toktamış would have done this
for a reason, Father.

27:05.373 --> 27:08.133
We need to figure out what that was.

27:08.413 --> 27:13.613
I would give my life to know what it was,
my valiant daughter.

27:18.613 --> 27:19.813
My life!

27:40.533 --> 27:42.813
I wish you hadn't left that body out,
my bey.

27:50.373 --> 27:51.453
A bey...

27:52.693 --> 27:55.213
should know how to hit
three birds with one stone.

28:02.053 --> 28:05.853
Toktamış's death will make them rise up.

28:06.733 --> 28:07.773
Now...

28:10.173 --> 28:11.133
your father...

28:13.133 --> 28:14.853
will also learn to give in.

28:15.613 --> 28:18.493
He will not trust anyone
but himself and I.

28:18.773 --> 28:19.613
Simon.

28:21.053 --> 28:22.853
If he reveals your secret one day...

28:24.293 --> 28:27.893
Then we will know to introduce him
to Azrael too.

28:28.773 --> 28:31.653
My Çolpan,
why do you worry yourself with this?

28:32.653 --> 28:34.933
I have no worries with you by my side.

28:35.453 --> 28:39.493
But something inside me says
the corpse shouldn't be on display.

28:40.013 --> 28:42.813
Tell that blind devil
that so worries you...

28:43.693 --> 28:45.533
that I will take out his other eye.

28:50.213 --> 28:51.653
Any word on the kilims?

28:51.733 --> 28:55.973
I had the best kilims,
the finest rugs ordered for you.

28:58.173 --> 29:01.813
I will play those Venetian infidels
so that...

29:02.493 --> 29:06.053
they'll place sacks of gold
in my palm without question.

29:07.213 --> 29:13.213
And I will lay the gold out
in front of my father to see.

29:13.893 --> 29:17.213
Then he will forget about Toktamış.

29:19.493 --> 29:22.973
Let us not leave Candar Bey alone,
mourning for Toktamış.

29:25.413 --> 29:28.573
-Come with me to the marketplace.
-I would like that.

29:29.333 --> 29:30.933
I also have things to buy.

29:32.173 --> 29:33.533
Let me tend to your wound.

29:44.333 --> 29:45.333
Father.

29:46.973 --> 29:49.973
I sent for my brother, Aliyar,
without your permission.

29:52.413 --> 29:53.653
I miss him.

29:55.613 --> 29:57.653
You're like your mother, Aslıhan.

29:59.813 --> 30:01.373
You're always up to something.

30:02.773 --> 30:04.893
The people need my brother, Aliyar.

30:06.813 --> 30:11.973
Aliyar is now a Tatar
who has lost his warrior spirit.

30:13.653 --> 30:17.093
They say he who wields a pen
can no longer wield a sword.

30:30.773 --> 30:33.133
-Are the kilims ready?
-They are, my bey.

30:33.573 --> 30:37.373
-Çolpan Hatun prepared them all.
-Aslıhan will go with you.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.773
Çolpan Hatun was going to assist, my bey.

30:48.213 --> 30:50.053
Didn't you hear Candar Bey, Ural?

30:51.053 --> 30:53.893
It's apparent that my father
wishes me to be by his side.

30:57.013 --> 31:00.613
If the Venetians
ask anything about the kilims,

31:02.133 --> 31:04.013
Aslıhan should be with you.

31:04.973 --> 31:09.493
After all, as a woman
she knows more about kilims than you.

31:23.493 --> 31:25.893
{\an8}KAYI CAMP

31:51.013 --> 31:55.733
No, Artuk Bey, this won't do. We have been
up against difficulties for so long now.

31:55.893 --> 32:00.973
We did as Ertuğrul Bey commanded.
However, he has forgotten Oghuz law.

32:02.333 --> 32:05.693
Artuk Bey is right, my bey.
What is this denial of assembly?

32:06.253 --> 32:08.373
We would die for our bey, Artuk Bey.

32:08.613 --> 32:12.493
But as it is the right of the beys
to ask for an assembly,

32:12.773 --> 32:15.613
it is the duty of the bey of the camp
to accept it.

32:16.093 --> 32:19.573
Ertuğrul Bey has disregarded the law
as he has disregarded us.

32:28.333 --> 32:32.413
Valiant Beys of the Kayi,
foremost of our boys,

32:33.093 --> 32:34.653
what you say is true.

32:35.973 --> 32:39.133
It is. However, hear me out too.

32:40.493 --> 32:44.173
I know you all want
what's good for the camp

32:44.573 --> 32:48.933
and worry about
the future of your children, your tent.

32:49.933 --> 32:53.493
It is true that our camp is going through
rough times.

32:54.333 --> 32:57.333
However, God Almighty says in the Quran,

32:57.973 --> 33:02.093
"There is comfort
after those difficulties."

33:03.253 --> 33:06.053
Not a day has passed
without worry and difficulty

33:06.413 --> 33:09.293
since we left for these lands.

33:09.893 --> 33:12.013
It seems our fate will continue to be so.

33:12.133 --> 33:15.173
However, know that
we are not to blame for this.

33:18.813 --> 33:21.133
The sword
cannot be forged without being beaten.

33:21.573 --> 33:26.733
These sorrows will make us stronger.

33:27.013 --> 33:32.013
But know that the biggest of sorrows
is bestowed upon our Bey.

33:32.853 --> 33:38.133
While we cannot even deal with
our own problems and give up,

33:38.733 --> 33:42.093
he is up against the difficulties
of the whole camp.

33:43.733 --> 33:48.053
His refusal of the assembly request
just shows how big that difficulty is.

33:51.613 --> 33:56.213
In the end, we know that weapons need men.

33:57.173 --> 34:00.853
Men need states, states need rulers.

34:01.533 --> 34:03.093
And rulers need laws.

34:03.573 --> 34:05.053
-True.
-True.

34:05.333 --> 34:06.773
That's true, Artuk Bey.

34:08.973 --> 34:10.773
Law is the heart of the state.

34:11.573 --> 34:14.453
Without law, the state is a lifeless body.

34:15.373 --> 34:22.013
Just as a state cannot live without law,
a beylik cannot either.

34:25.533 --> 34:29.853
You know that the mountain
holds up the land.

34:30.253 --> 34:33.173
And the bey holds up the camp.

34:34.013 --> 34:37.253
Our bey knows this best.

34:38.253 --> 34:43.453
Ertuğrul Bey will hold the assembly soon
and do his part, God willing.

34:43.973 --> 34:45.933
-God willing.
-God willing.

35:00.333 --> 35:01.693
What's the situation?

35:02.773 --> 35:05.333
These goods
are not worth the ride to the marketplace.

35:07.693 --> 35:09.573
So it's bad.

35:10.333 --> 35:15.973
How are we to persuade these people at war
if we can't persuade them to trade kilim?

35:20.293 --> 35:22.973
Ertuğrul must return to the camp at once.

35:33.653 --> 35:36.533
Artuk Bey is coming with the people.
I hope it's good news.

35:55.933 --> 35:58.213
It wasn't about the kilims, Hayme Hatun.

35:58.693 --> 36:01.453
They resented our bey
not organizing the assembly.

36:03.693 --> 36:06.173
How sensitive the Kayi camp has gotten.

36:07.533 --> 36:11.173
You can't organize a wedding ceremony
with them, let alone an assembly.

36:19.413 --> 36:20.293
Brother!

36:23.813 --> 36:26.453
Thank god you got back safe.
How was the hunt?

36:26.893 --> 36:28.173
Fruitful, Dundar.

36:36.093 --> 36:38.733
-Power to your elbow, Halime Hatun.
-Thank you.

36:41.493 --> 36:43.733
But we haven't accumulated enough kilims.

36:45.733 --> 36:48.133
Don't worry about it. I know my boys.

36:48.813 --> 36:51.213
They will bring whatever they have left.

37:06.853 --> 37:10.373
My bey, you know
my sons and I always believed in you.

37:11.333 --> 37:13.213
I gave up everything for you.

37:14.493 --> 37:18.173
This is the last kilim
I and my orphaned grandson have.

37:21.453 --> 37:23.853
-You can have this too.
-Thank you, Hatun.

37:28.813 --> 37:31.493
The Kayi will rise
on the shoulders of people like you.

37:31.613 --> 37:33.893
Thank you. May God bless you.

37:48.173 --> 37:51.693
Ertuğrul Bey, this is yours
and our last chance.

37:52.413 --> 37:57.133
If you don't succeed this time either,
know that you won't keep us in this land.

38:06.693 --> 38:08.213
-Samsar!
-Yes, my bey.

38:08.653 --> 38:10.733
-Gather the kilims.
-Yes, my bey.

38:13.613 --> 38:16.373
You, come with me. We shall consult.

38:16.973 --> 38:18.373
-Yes.
-Yes, my bey.

38:51.133 --> 38:55.053
{\an8}HANLI MARKET

38:59.933 --> 39:02.973
Last night the Templars were humiliated.

39:07.493 --> 39:10.493
The enemy that we tried to entrap
ruined our plan.

39:13.013 --> 39:14.613
What do we do now, sir?

39:14.773 --> 39:17.093
First, we find out who our enemy is.

39:17.613 --> 39:20.733
This enemy is like us.
It does not give itself up.

39:21.293 --> 39:23.373
It's the first time we've encountered
a worthy enemy.

39:32.173 --> 39:34.213
The enemy does not give itself up, my bey.

39:35.813 --> 39:38.773
My bey, these are the ones
that came our way before.

39:40.693 --> 39:42.973
They are not as smart as we thought.

39:43.253 --> 39:45.293
They've thrown away a big fish, my bey.

39:46.093 --> 39:50.893
One that doesn't drown in a wild river
but flows in the depths, Turgut.

39:51.533 --> 39:52.973
You are right, Artuk Bey.

39:55.773 --> 39:59.453
We fought Noyan, my bey.
These will be light work.

40:02.413 --> 40:03.933
We knew who the Noyan were, Turgut.

40:06.853 --> 40:08.453
A valiant enemy is something else.

40:10.813 --> 40:12.173
However, these are dishonorable.

40:13.253 --> 40:14.693
How will we identify him?

40:16.173 --> 40:18.733
He came once, he will come again.

40:19.533 --> 40:21.693
He probably wants to know who we are.

40:22.133 --> 40:24.373
We should watch everyone
at the marketplace.

40:24.853 --> 40:27.373
Be aware of every step that is taken.

40:27.693 --> 40:31.173
You will closely follow anyone
who makes a lot of money,

40:31.693 --> 40:35.293
is trading out of nowhere
and has the ability to wage war.

40:37.053 --> 40:40.373
-Leave the Muslims to me.
-And the others to me.

40:40.933 --> 40:43.693
We will use Tristan as bait.

40:44.973 --> 40:47.053
They will definitely come to capture him.

40:47.813 --> 40:51.813
We only have a name. John the Baptist.

40:52.533 --> 40:57.053
First, we must capture that slave dealer.
He will take us to him.

40:57.653 --> 41:00.613
Put Dumrul on this task, Turgut Alp.

41:00.933 --> 41:02.133
Yes, my bey.

41:03.733 --> 41:04.773
However...

41:06.773 --> 41:10.493
they might want to use Tristan as bait
and lure us into a trap.

41:13.293 --> 41:17.053
Well, would you look at Turgut!
As sharp as a needle.

41:17.173 --> 41:19.013
Praise be to my brother! Praise be!

41:26.173 --> 41:30.053
You are right, Turgut Alp.
Dumrul must cover his tracks.

41:30.693 --> 41:32.053
Just gather information.

41:34.293 --> 41:35.413
We will follow everyone.

41:37.493 --> 41:41.333
The merchants,
the customers that come and go...

41:42.333 --> 41:44.533
the people, everyone.

41:46.173 --> 41:47.893
And they will follow us.

41:49.813 --> 41:51.613
Let's see where our paths collide.

41:57.493 --> 41:58.493
Now...

41:59.493 --> 42:02.573
it is time to load the kilims
and be on our way.

42:04.213 --> 42:05.573
The Venetians await us.

42:07.053 --> 42:08.933
-Yes, my bey.
-Yes, my bey.

42:25.973 --> 42:32.053
My bey. God forbid, if we can't sell
the kilims, the people will lose hope.

42:35.093 --> 42:37.413
I will find a way to sell them, Artuk Bey.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.133
Otherwise,
I cannot show my face in the camp.

42:41.853 --> 42:42.973
I see, my bey.

42:44.453 --> 42:47.573
My bey, I would also like you to
hear out Hacaturyan.

42:47.813 --> 42:48.893
On what grounds?

42:49.253 --> 42:51.453
He might be God's blessing to us.

42:53.893 --> 42:54.933
Let him come in.

43:15.773 --> 43:16.733
Sit.

43:19.173 --> 43:20.053
I am listening.

43:21.013 --> 43:22.253
Ertuğrul Bey...

43:23.293 --> 43:28.173
like I said before,
I will most certainly repay my debt.

43:29.653 --> 43:30.853
I explained to Artuk Bey.

43:36.813 --> 43:38.253
I have a plan.

43:40.213 --> 43:41.373
A creek.

43:43.133 --> 43:46.013
A pine tree at the beginning of the river.

43:46.133 --> 43:50.853
Inside the river, <i>oski...</i>

43:51.653 --> 43:54.293
Gold! Lots of gold.

43:55.133 --> 44:00.253
Ertuğrul Bey, if you can
get me the required equipment,

44:00.893 --> 44:04.573
-I will dig out that gold.
-What is it that you need?

44:05.693 --> 44:11.173
Long birches, and then hammers,
for we will mine... Sieves...

44:11.733 --> 44:14.773
Okay then.
I will get them from the market.

44:24.693 --> 44:28.413
Pile the kilims on the front.
The Venetians will be able to carry them.

44:46.653 --> 44:51.413
Both you and my brother are so sure
that the Venetians will buy our goods.

44:52.213 --> 44:53.973
I'm sure of everything Ural Bey does.

44:56.293 --> 44:58.493
Are you sure Toktamış is a traitor then?

45:00.493 --> 45:03.813
For me, anyone who draws a sword
on Ural Bey is a traitor, Aslıhan Hatun.

45:07.133 --> 45:10.253
-Is everything ready?
-Yes, my bey. The animals too.

45:10.453 --> 45:13.213
-We can move the goods at your command.
-Good.

45:13.853 --> 45:17.133
We brought all these goods.
What if we can't sell them, brother?

45:17.733 --> 45:21.173
There are no goods at this market
that Ural Bey can't sell.

45:40.813 --> 45:42.733
So, the Venetians await.

45:43.253 --> 45:44.413
I'll come too.

45:45.573 --> 45:47.533
I have a private matter
to discuss with Simon.

45:48.333 --> 45:50.213
Batuhan will bring you in later.

46:28.435 --> 46:30.195
My dear friend Simon.

46:32.515 --> 46:34.035
That's why I like you.

46:35.035 --> 46:37.275
I'm told there was trouble yesterday
in the bazaar...

46:38.595 --> 46:40.075
and you don't even care.

46:42.115 --> 46:43.555
I'm resting my soul.

46:45.235 --> 46:48.875
Toktamış' departure from this world
has made me quite happy.

46:49.635 --> 46:53.795
No one can prevent us filling our pockets
with tons of gold now.

47:00.955 --> 47:03.755
This time it's not 50-50, Sir Simon.

47:09.315 --> 47:10.435
What do you mean?

47:15.035 --> 47:19.675
Thanks to you, getting rid of Toktamış
was easy.

47:20.875 --> 47:25.955
But you must have some patience
until I restore my credibility

47:26.435 --> 47:27.795
with my father.

47:35.475 --> 47:38.875
Take one tenth of the market share
and leave.

47:43.115 --> 47:48.035
As long as you have this cunning
you'll never be able to restore it.

47:50.155 --> 47:54.635
Now that your brother Aliyar
has arrived in the tribe,

47:55.155 --> 47:58.755
your father will give the responsibility
to your decent brother.

48:01.195 --> 48:04.235
Keep your eyes away from my tribe.

48:06.075 --> 48:08.635
Or else you won't get to see
any beauty in the world again.

48:22.235 --> 48:25.995
Calm down, my dear fellow.
It's just friendly advice.

48:26.755 --> 48:27.795
Also...

48:30.875 --> 48:32.755
the beauty is hidden in the details.

48:34.235 --> 48:37.275
That's why you Turks don't understand
women's spirit.

48:41.395 --> 48:45.595
This amulet will make Lady Çolpan
quite happy.

48:46.595 --> 48:48.235
And, my dear partner...

48:49.875 --> 48:51.115
a happy woman means...

48:52.475 --> 48:53.955
a powerful man.

49:11.355 --> 49:16.235
Oh, mankind! You have never given up...

49:17.875 --> 49:19.875
on the cunning of your ancestor, Cain.

49:22.475 --> 49:24.315
Don't bother your conscience, sir.

49:27.155 --> 49:29.555
The punishment was necessary
for the traitor.

49:30.595 --> 49:36.115
Yes, but do you think other traitors
will get the message?

49:54.875 --> 49:56.915
Sir Aliyar is coming, sir.

50:25.235 --> 50:29.515
Aslıhan said you were coming
but I wasn't expecting you so soon.

50:29.635 --> 50:33.035
-Welcome.
-When Aslıhan said to come quick,

50:34.115 --> 50:35.835
I got worried, Father.

50:36.835 --> 50:39.515
I thought something happened to you.
Thank God you're well.

50:40.075 --> 50:42.795
-Thank God.
-Welcome, Sir Aliyar.

50:43.435 --> 50:45.995
Thank you, Aunt. Thank you.

51:16.955 --> 51:17.795
Father...

51:23.075 --> 51:24.635
Isn't that Sir Toktamış?

51:28.035 --> 51:31.315
What happened to him, Father?
Who took his life?

51:32.555 --> 51:35.035
Father. What's going on?

51:35.755 --> 51:37.755
Treason was punished.

51:40.435 --> 51:41.275
What treason?

51:42.915 --> 51:46.235
Yesterday he tried to kill me
and your brother.

51:48.875 --> 51:53.275
But why, Father?
He was your brother, your comrade.

51:56.115 --> 52:02.075
Son, sadly I had to witness
the treason of my blood brother.

52:04.435 --> 52:07.115
Sir Ural did it for all to see.

52:31.035 --> 52:31.875
Father...

52:33.835 --> 52:36.715
The soul is God's gift to the body.

52:38.275 --> 52:41.875
It's the soul which should be punished,
not the body.

52:42.995 --> 52:45.995
Father, let us wash and bury him...

52:47.355 --> 52:49.475
as is appropriate for us.

52:50.915 --> 52:53.475
Even your revenge should be fair.

52:54.195 --> 52:55.395
In a just way.

53:02.795 --> 53:03.915
Very well, son.

53:05.955 --> 53:12.395
Have him buried without a prayer funeral
after being cleaned.

53:22.595 --> 53:24.275
Kutluca, come.

53:37.955 --> 53:40.475
I brought the Venetian tradesmen to you.

53:41.075 --> 53:43.595
We agreed to split the earnings 50-50.

53:43.835 --> 53:45.595
Have some patience, Sir Simon.

53:46.275 --> 53:49.915
You'll get more than you deserve
once I've restored my credibility

53:50.755 --> 53:52.795
in these unclaimed lands.

53:56.355 --> 54:00.115
Ricardo, my dear friend.

54:02.995 --> 54:06.115
Here is the fellow I'd like you to meet,
Ural Bey of Cavdar tribe.

54:07.635 --> 54:08.675
Open up.

54:27.515 --> 54:29.355
I'll pay two gold pieces per rug.

54:30.395 --> 54:31.915
You have to pay at least three.

54:35.995 --> 54:38.235
Why would these rugs
be worth that much?

54:39.435 --> 54:40.795
-Our rugs--
-For once...

54:42.435 --> 54:43.875
they are the best you can find.

54:45.275 --> 54:47.075
With no better options,

54:47.555 --> 54:50.675
you'll have to spend days
searching for alternatives.

54:51.715 --> 54:56.035
Additionally, I know the ship
that is taking you to Constantinople

54:56.355 --> 54:57.795
will not wait much longer.

54:58.995 --> 55:01.795
So, you don't have time,

55:02.315 --> 55:06.315
and I don't have the will
to sell these rugs for less.

55:09.555 --> 55:12.195
You seem to have forgotten
what we discussed, Ural Bey.

55:16.195 --> 55:19.075
I have given my final word, Sir Simon.

55:21.155 --> 55:24.515
I'll be expecting word from you.
Take them away.

55:25.595 --> 55:28.835
You know where to find me
if you change your mind.

55:36.995 --> 55:40.515
Is this the promise you made, Simon?
I trusted you and changed my plans.

55:41.155 --> 55:44.275
Shut up, Ricardo. I'll figure it out.

55:47.315 --> 55:50.795
Brother, why did you say
three gold pieces per rug?

55:51.235 --> 55:54.675
That's not what we discussed with Father.
What will he say if we leave with nothing?

55:54.995 --> 55:59.235
Keep out of this. Your duty
is to create rugs, mine is to sell.

55:59.875 --> 56:01.515
They have to buy these rugs.

56:01.755 --> 56:05.115
I'm not fool enough to let them go
without taking advantage.

56:05.675 --> 56:09.595
They will come to me like a god
and pay me lots of gold.

56:22.515 --> 56:24.075
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

56:50.555 --> 56:52.035
Abundance of clots in the blood.

57:03.995 --> 57:05.235
Bloodshot eyes.

57:10.675 --> 57:12.795
A tongue the color of indigo.

57:19.035 --> 57:20.715
A shedding skin.

57:30.635 --> 57:32.195
What did they make you drink?

57:37.235 --> 57:40.635
Troubled apostles of Jesus!

57:41.195 --> 57:43.835
Trader sons of Moses.

57:44.835 --> 57:47.635
Brave warriors of Muhammed.

57:49.195 --> 57:52.275
Simon says, "In this bazaar

57:52.515 --> 57:56.435
all the goods are my responsibility.

57:57.155 --> 58:00.875
The vandals
who harassed the bazaar yesterday

58:01.355 --> 58:04.395
will be punished as soon as possible.

58:05.155 --> 58:10.635
If any of you knows them, you should
immediately share the information."

58:15.075 --> 58:17.955
You will catch them. Right.

58:18.875 --> 58:21.555
What if they don't come to you?
What if they don't buy the rugs?

58:21.635 --> 58:24.075
-What would you say to Father?
-Shut up, Aslıhan!

58:24.635 --> 58:27.475
You're cruel enough to obey
those who go behind my back.

58:28.875 --> 58:31.035
-What are you saying?
-Do you think I'm fool enough

58:31.115 --> 58:33.555
not to understand your pact
with that old man Toktamış?

58:33.995 --> 58:35.675
I'll make you pay when the time is right.

58:49.395 --> 58:50.715
Well, well, well!

58:52.115 --> 58:54.595
Brave Bey of Kayi tribe, Ertuğrul.

58:57.235 --> 59:00.195
Arriving at the scene
with his slave again.

59:02.915 --> 59:05.635
It seems your sword has got rusty.

59:06.755 --> 59:08.675
You wander around
like a fish out of water.

59:09.955 --> 59:12.915
It's hard
not to fail in this bazaar, Ertuğrul Bey.

59:15.435 --> 59:19.315
God giveth and God taketh,
veteran of bazaars, Ural Bey.

59:20.075 --> 59:21.875
It's hard not to fail in life, too.

59:23.755 --> 59:27.835
Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah,
don't forget my words.

59:30.675 --> 59:32.755
Be careful
not to lose your goods to others.

59:47.675 --> 59:49.515
Excuse my brother, Ertuğrul Bey.

59:51.155 --> 59:52.315
Thank you, Lady Aslıhan.

59:55.835 --> 59:57.315
You have brought the rugs.

00:59:58.915 --> 01:00:00.515
We've brought all we have in the tribe.

01:00:01.355 --> 01:00:03.235
Hopefully we will be able to sell them.

01:00:03.955 --> 01:00:07.875
The Venetians are inside.
They failed to agree with my brother.

01:00:08.755 --> 01:00:12.675
You can sell the rugs if the price
is less than three gold pieces per rug.

01:00:15.035 --> 01:00:16.155
Appreciate it, Lady Aslıhan.

01:00:22.635 --> 01:00:23.675
Turgut.

01:00:28.595 --> 01:00:30.595
-Yes, sir.
-Is Dumrul ready?

01:00:36.275 --> 01:00:37.155
Yes, sir.

01:00:42.315 --> 01:00:43.315
Hacaturyan.

01:00:44.315 --> 01:00:47.115
-Yes, sir.
-You know what to do.

01:00:48.275 --> 01:00:54.075
Don't you worry, sir. I won't put you
or your tribe in danger.

01:00:54.915 --> 01:00:58.315
Hopefully, as you say.

01:01:00.595 --> 01:01:01.835
Thank you.

01:01:10.395 --> 01:01:13.955
Ural's bid is too high.
We trusted you and came all this way.

01:01:14.355 --> 01:01:17.755
Do you Venetians think
you are the only traders?

01:01:18.435 --> 01:01:21.155
We know the value of goods
very well, Simon.

01:01:21.795 --> 01:01:23.675
What Ural demands
is a whole year's profit.

01:01:29.355 --> 01:01:30.555
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:01:32.315 --> 01:01:33.275
What gives?

01:01:34.075 --> 01:01:36.675
I have 100 rugs sewn by the women
of my tribe.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:38.635
I'd like to sell them.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:41.075
You were sent by the son of God.

01:01:42.835 --> 01:01:45.475
Look, Simon, look. God is with us.

01:01:54.475 --> 01:01:58.235
I'm here with the rugs,
ready to talk with the buyer.

01:02:09.555 --> 01:02:11.675
-How much are these?
-Five akces.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.995
Sir, please, sir. We're hungry.
For God's sake, sir.

01:03:29.075 --> 01:03:32.635
We are hungry. Please, sir.
For God's sake.

01:03:32.715 --> 01:03:35.155
-Please, sir.
-For God's sake.

01:03:35.755 --> 01:03:36.955
<i>As-salamu alaykum.</i>

01:03:37.115 --> 01:03:39.835
-We are hungry, sir.
-Please, sir.

01:03:44.515 --> 01:03:47.275
-Go away, go on.
<i>-Aleykumselam</i>.

01:03:49.395 --> 01:03:53.635
What's up, Muslim? Do you have a problem?
Let us help you out if so.

01:03:54.115 --> 01:03:57.155
Look, here is my stand.
Let us feed you if you are hungry.

01:03:57.235 --> 01:04:00.035
-Rest here if you are tired.
-Much appreciated.

01:04:00.875 --> 01:04:03.435
I don't have any problem. Take it easy.

01:04:20.275 --> 01:04:22.475
Dundar, show them the rugs.

01:04:49.195 --> 01:04:51.555
You are smarter than I thought,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:04:54.635 --> 01:04:55.715
But don't forget...

01:04:56.755 --> 01:04:58.235
my bazaar has its rules.

01:05:02.475 --> 01:05:04.115
One tenth of every sale is mine.

01:05:07.315 --> 01:05:08.235
I am aware.

01:05:35.195 --> 01:05:38.355
These rugs are the finest quality, Simon.
I've never seen anything like it.

01:05:39.755 --> 01:05:43.355
I can sell them for at least
30 gold pieces a rug in Venice.

01:05:47.555 --> 01:05:48.395
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:05:50.955 --> 01:05:52.595
How much do you want for the rugs?

01:05:53.555 --> 01:05:55.035
Three gold pieces per rug.

01:05:56.155 --> 01:05:58.195
300 gold pieces for 100 rugs.

01:06:02.555 --> 01:06:05.075
Why would they be worth
300 gold pieces, Turk?

01:06:06.675 --> 01:06:09.155
These are meticulously handcrafted
by the women of my tribe.

01:06:10.275 --> 01:06:11.955
They were meant to be gifts

01:06:12.715 --> 01:06:15.035
for our daughters' weddings,
not intended for sale.

01:06:17.315 --> 01:06:20.755
Well, these are the finest rugs
I have ever seen.

01:06:21.555 --> 01:06:24.715
And about the price...
That wouldn't let me make a profit.

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:30.475
There's a price for taking all these
precious goods to Constantinople.

01:06:31.155 --> 01:06:34.355
You know, bandits are everywhere.

01:06:34.675 --> 01:06:35.955
I can handle that, too.

01:06:37.475 --> 01:06:40.275
My Alps can take the goods
to anywhere you want in Constantinople.

01:06:43.915 --> 01:06:47.955
You can hold me responsible
if any harm comes to it.

01:06:49.515 --> 01:06:50.675
We have a deal, Turk.

01:07:43.795 --> 01:07:45.955
I will abide by the rules
of the bazaar, Lord Simon.

01:07:47.715 --> 01:07:48.755
One tenth is yours.

01:08:10.475 --> 01:08:12.115
I wouldn't have it any other way.

01:08:32.315 --> 01:08:34.795
How come Ertuğrul knows
the Venetians are here?

01:08:35.275 --> 01:08:37.955
Aslıhan told him.
I overheard them talking.

01:08:38.835 --> 01:08:41.675
Also they asked me
what happened in the bazaar yesterday.

01:08:44.395 --> 01:08:46.675
Send a pigeon to Constantinople
right away.

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:50.515
Let's see what our people know
about Ertuğrul.

01:08:57.555 --> 01:08:58.835
-Turgut.
-Yes, sir.

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:02.355
You'll take the rugs to Constantinople
with the alps.

01:09:03.195 --> 01:09:04.195
Of course, sir.

01:09:05.315 --> 01:09:07.155
Two of my men will go with them.

01:09:08.275 --> 01:09:09.515
They are fine musketeers.

01:09:10.915 --> 01:09:12.315
They'll be our guests.

01:09:12.675 --> 01:09:17.155
Hopefully, they will reach Constantinople
in peace, without any musketeering.

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:41.915
Lord Simon.

01:09:42.835 --> 01:09:45.475
What happened?
Have the heathens come to their senses?

01:09:46.275 --> 01:09:50.235
While you are sitting here
bragging like a king,

01:09:50.795 --> 01:09:54.515
those out on their horses
chasing their bread have learned a lot.

01:09:55.875 --> 01:09:59.115
And you are not even aware of it
because of your greed.

01:10:00.275 --> 01:10:01.875
What the hell are you saying, Lord Simon?

01:10:02.715 --> 01:10:05.795
The Venetians have bought what they want.

01:10:07.955 --> 01:10:08.795
From whom?

01:10:10.035 --> 01:10:12.475
-Who is the degenerate?
-Ertuğrul.

01:10:15.195 --> 01:10:20.195
And he did it for your price.
300 gold for 100 rugs.

01:10:20.915 --> 01:10:24.675
Nothing changed for me.
I still made my profit.

01:10:26.315 --> 01:10:30.275
How did Ertuğrul know the Venetians
were coming to buy rugs?

01:10:31.315 --> 01:10:32.475
Did you tell him?

01:10:35.115 --> 01:10:36.155
Not me.

01:10:36.715 --> 01:10:37.555
Aslıhan.

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:43.435
-Aslıhan?
-Yes, your sister.

01:10:45.715 --> 01:10:49.755
Ertuğrul also said they will take the rugs
to Constantinople with Senior Alp Turgut.

01:10:50.595 --> 01:10:52.955
He will be held responsible
if any harm comes to the goods.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:57.075
Smart man, knew how to win Ricardo over.

01:11:00.555 --> 01:11:02.795
Batuhan. Where is Aslıhan?

01:11:03.075 --> 01:11:04.635
I saw her going back to camp, sir.

01:11:18.835 --> 01:11:21.075
You can buy whatever is needed
with this money.

01:11:21.275 --> 01:11:22.555
Yes, sir.

01:11:26.755 --> 01:11:28.955
Sir, Ural Bey is coming.

01:11:31.435 --> 01:11:33.195
As if he realized his failure.

01:11:36.035 --> 01:11:38.675
I'll talk to him.
You deal with your business.

01:11:46.115 --> 01:11:49.755
I heard you sold all your rugs,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:11:51.555 --> 01:11:55.275
Showed some trading skills
in addition to your bravery.

01:11:57.915 --> 01:11:59.795
I listened to what you said, Ural Bey.

01:12:01.555 --> 01:12:03.395
Sold the rugs for a good price.

01:12:04.795 --> 01:12:09.075
I like competency.
A competent rival keeps you virile.

01:12:10.555 --> 01:12:15.555
Well, thanks to you I'll be more virile
and bold.

01:12:18.435 --> 01:12:19.635
Excuse me.

01:12:31.235 --> 01:12:32.235
Sir.

01:12:33.475 --> 01:12:35.155
Shall we make them pay?

01:12:38.155 --> 01:12:40.755
It will be
an exemplary punishment, Batuhan.

01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:48.475
Slay all the Alps of Ertuğrul.

01:12:49.755 --> 01:12:51.835
Set the rugs ablaze.

01:12:52.995 --> 01:12:58.595
Burn their animals alive.
Let the land be filled with their groans.

01:13:00.195 --> 01:13:02.315
Should they know it's us?

01:13:04.755 --> 01:13:05.835
No...

01:13:07.355 --> 01:13:08.595
He won't know who.

01:13:10.315 --> 01:13:14.395
The craving for revenge
will eat him alive.

01:13:19.835 --> 01:13:21.475
What about Lady Aslıhan, sir?

01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:24.155
What will you do to her?

01:13:35.515 --> 01:13:38.795
Bring it on, brother. Come on.

01:13:39.795 --> 01:13:41.035
Here you go.

01:13:47.755 --> 01:13:49.315
Take it easy, fellas.

01:13:53.075 --> 01:13:55.395
I see you are in the mood.

01:13:55.795 --> 01:13:58.635
Turgut Alp,
I didn't know you were able to laugh.

01:14:05.795 --> 01:14:06.755
Who are these people?

01:14:08.275 --> 01:14:13.195
These two Venetians will accompany you.
I'm sure you'll keep them safe.

01:14:17.115 --> 01:14:20.355
I'd love to host you at our inn

01:14:21.115 --> 01:14:23.355
and talk about your voyage.

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:43.195
What does she have to do with you?
I don't get it.

01:14:43.675 --> 01:14:47.275
Obviously, Turgut Alp makes her head spin.

01:14:48.475 --> 01:14:49.515
Just stop it!

01:14:50.515 --> 01:14:51.835
It's inappropriate, Dundar Bey.

01:14:54.355 --> 01:14:57.395
What is it?
You've fetched the whole bazaar.

01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:03.915
Ertuğrul Bey asked for some materials,
I fetched them.

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:06.835
Well done.

01:15:11.675 --> 01:15:13.995
We've got what we need, sir.
We can be on our way.

01:15:15.035 --> 01:15:17.595
-Thank you, Dundar.
-We loaded the Venetians' cart

01:15:17.675 --> 01:15:20.315
with the rugs. Ready to go.

01:15:27.235 --> 01:15:28.355
Safe travels, Turgut Alp.

01:15:29.955 --> 01:15:31.235
Thank you, sir.

01:15:32.355 --> 01:15:33.435
Thank you, brothers.

01:15:42.555 --> 01:15:45.915
Sir, I got what you asked for.

01:15:49.035 --> 01:15:52.235
Very well, then. Let's be on our way.

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:54.035
Yes, sir.

01:16:11.235 --> 01:16:16.555
The wheel of fortune is spinning again.
Let's see who will be crushed this time.

01:16:17.555 --> 01:16:21.195
Ural won't let the rugs
reach Constantinople.

01:16:25.995 --> 01:16:28.755
With such lust in Ural,
it won't be easy for Turgut Alp.

01:16:30.195 --> 01:16:31.795
May the Holy Spirit help him.

01:16:35.555 --> 01:16:37.155
What's up, dear sister?

01:16:38.115 --> 01:16:40.475
Do you want to lure Turgut Alp
into your net?

01:16:42.755 --> 01:16:44.315
You're mistaken, Lord Simon.

01:16:45.195 --> 01:16:47.915
My nets only serve our holy cause.

01:16:51.395 --> 01:16:52.715
Glad to hear that.

01:16:54.555 --> 01:16:57.595
There will be nothing left of Turgut Alp
but dust, soon.

01:16:58.395 --> 01:17:01.635
We will enjoy setting the bandits
against each other

01:17:02.835 --> 01:17:06.115
while Ural and the rugs burn
in the same flames.

01:17:09.075 --> 01:17:11.515
Go for the Castle of Karacahisar
early in the morning.

01:17:12.195 --> 01:17:15.475
They owe us a great deal.
I'd like you to negotiate with Philip.

01:17:31.515 --> 01:17:35.475
Whoa!

01:17:44.275 --> 01:17:47.115
Where is he?

01:17:54.635 --> 01:17:58.275
-Where is the corpse of Toktamış?
-Aliyar Bey had it removed.

01:18:03.915 --> 01:18:06.115
-Put him back where he was.
-It's too late.

01:18:07.075 --> 01:18:09.115
Aliyar Bey had the body buried.

01:18:21.755 --> 01:18:22.955
What have you done, Aslıhan?

01:18:24.315 --> 01:18:27.475
What's up, brother?
Your eyes are about to pop.

01:18:28.115 --> 01:18:30.955
I guess you couldn't take advantage
of the Venetians as you expected.

01:18:32.315 --> 01:18:33.515
She is our sister.

01:18:35.875 --> 01:18:37.195
Don't break hearts, brother.

01:18:38.275 --> 01:18:41.755
Let my arm go, Aliyar.
Or I will break your heart.

01:18:42.035 --> 01:18:43.475
If it will ease your anger...

01:18:44.515 --> 01:18:45.515
so be it, brother.

01:18:47.755 --> 01:18:50.675
Why did you tell him about the Venetians?

01:18:50.995 --> 01:18:54.595
You put us in a hard place.
We couldn't sell the rugs because of you.

01:18:54.835 --> 01:18:58.515
You lost because of your greed.
The responsibility is yours.

01:18:59.195 --> 01:19:00.715
-Aslıhan!
-Brother!

01:19:01.515 --> 01:19:03.755
Enough. Come to your senses.

01:19:06.595 --> 01:19:07.955
Well, well, well!

01:19:08.795 --> 01:19:12.875
Aliyar, this is real life.
It's much different than in those books.

01:19:13.035 --> 01:19:15.515
-Know your place.
-What is going on here?

01:19:17.275 --> 01:19:18.635
What's wrong with you?

01:19:20.995 --> 01:19:22.115
Answer me, Ural.

01:19:23.955 --> 01:19:26.275
I was unable to sell the rugs
because of Aslıhan, Father.

01:19:28.035 --> 01:19:29.235
Is that true, Aslıhan?

01:19:30.675 --> 01:19:31.915
Because of me?

01:19:32.275 --> 01:19:35.235
You wanted to sell them
for more than the agreed price.

01:19:35.555 --> 01:19:38.195
Why don't you admit you made a mistake?

01:19:39.195 --> 01:19:42.875
Are you trying to make me pay
for your own faults, my brother?

01:19:44.915 --> 01:19:47.115
Is this true, Ural?

01:19:48.475 --> 01:19:51.915
I demanded more in order to bargain.

01:19:52.915 --> 01:19:57.115
I thought we were the only option
for the Venetians.

01:19:57.955 --> 01:20:00.755
However, Aslıhan happened to tell Ertuğrul

01:20:01.155 --> 01:20:03.715
that the Venetians were buying rugs.

01:20:04.555 --> 01:20:07.115
So they bought all the rugs of Kayi tribe.

01:20:10.595 --> 01:20:11.595
How...

01:20:12.355 --> 01:20:15.195
could you do that, Aslıhan?

01:20:16.835 --> 01:20:23.355
After all our effort and sweat
trying to improve the rug house,

01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:27.275
how could you turn a blind eye to it?

01:20:29.035 --> 01:20:32.075
-Father, I just--
-She has stabbed us

01:20:32.395 --> 01:20:34.555
in our backs, father.

01:20:39.555 --> 01:20:42.675
This is a very bitter surprise, Aslıhan.
Shame on you.

01:20:44.235 --> 01:20:47.435
I'm ashamed to have a daughter like you.

01:20:51.115 --> 01:20:53.315
Sister Aslıhan made a mistake, Father.

01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:56.715
The damage is done.

01:20:57.235 --> 01:21:02.035
From now on, I don't want Aslıhan
to be with me in the bazaar dealings.

01:21:03.195 --> 01:21:07.635
Either my wife Çolpan supports me
as the head of rug house

01:21:07.995 --> 01:21:10.675
or you find someone else
to run the business instead of me.

01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:02.955
It cost me 100 rugs. However,
I got rid of Aslıhan and won you.

01:22:03.635 --> 01:22:06.595
Don't let Aslıhan get in my way again,
my Çolpan.

01:22:07.275 --> 01:22:08.795
Don't you worry, Ural Bey.

01:22:09.675 --> 01:22:12.515
I won't let her anywhere
near the rug house now.

01:22:25.035 --> 01:22:29.355
Venetians were going to come to us
and buy our rugs.

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:36.875
The rugs of the Kayis will burn in flames.

01:22:38.835 --> 01:22:40.315
Ertuğrul will be indebted.

01:22:42.475 --> 01:22:46.715
I told that shepherd to go
back to his land, but he didn't listen.

01:22:47.755 --> 01:22:49.155
He will pay dearly for it.

01:22:50.595 --> 01:22:53.355
Maybe he will take Aslıhan with him
when he leaves, who knows?

01:22:55.195 --> 01:22:58.995
-What do you think, my Çolpan?
-It's clear she felt for him.

01:22:59.635 --> 01:23:01.515
She wouldn't do such a thing if not.

01:23:31.195 --> 01:23:32.315
You...

01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:34.995
trust in your man, my Çolpan.

01:23:38.955 --> 01:23:42.755
With your loyalty and my power,

01:23:43.475 --> 01:23:47.075
the Cavdar tribe
will get what it deserves.

01:24:11.195 --> 01:24:13.435
-Welcome back, sir.
-Welcome, sir.

01:24:15.475 --> 01:24:18.915
-Welcome, my brave fellow.
-Welcome, Bey.

01:24:29.755 --> 01:24:33.635
Welcome back!

01:24:33.715 --> 01:24:36.195
Everyone will be delighted, sir.

01:24:48.235 --> 01:24:51.955
May God watch over you.
We knew you wouldn't let us go hungry.

01:24:52.355 --> 01:24:56.435
Thanks to you, our tribe will be filled
with joy again. God bless you, sir.

01:24:56.795 --> 01:24:59.355
-God bless you, too.
-Amen.

01:25:00.955 --> 01:25:03.675
You brought food for us, sir!

01:25:04.435 --> 01:25:05.915
God bless you.

01:25:06.475 --> 01:25:08.835
-Father.
-My Gunduz.

01:25:15.155 --> 01:25:18.555
Lend a hand, brothers.
Let's unload the bags.

01:25:18.635 --> 01:25:21.155
Or we will starve
because of the long wait of unloading.

01:25:23.795 --> 01:25:25.315
So help me God!

01:25:34.075 --> 01:25:36.955
-May God protect him.
-Amen.

01:25:38.795 --> 01:25:40.475
-Praise be.
-Dear God.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:49.435
Welcome back, Son. Thank God.

01:25:50.115 --> 01:25:53.515
Our tribe will be filled
with peace from now on.

01:25:54.395 --> 01:25:57.075
As my mother says,
the steel met with the water.

01:25:57.475 --> 01:26:01.515
Our tribe will find its way
just like the water does. God bless you.

01:26:02.315 --> 01:26:05.875
We will always find our way
as long as you stand by our side.

01:26:12.395 --> 01:26:17.475
Thank God,
our tribe is more prosperous than ever.

01:26:18.195 --> 01:26:22.795
We have enough wheat
and flour for everyone.

01:26:24.595 --> 01:26:26.995
May God rain prosperity over them.

01:26:27.195 --> 01:26:28.515
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:26:28.875 --> 01:26:29.875
Amen.

01:26:36.635 --> 01:26:38.835
God bless you, sir.

01:26:39.515 --> 01:26:42.355
May God watch over you.

01:26:42.635 --> 01:26:45.075
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

01:26:47.675 --> 01:26:49.635
May God protect you.

01:26:51.515 --> 01:26:54.595
-Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
-Long live!

01:27:09.715 --> 01:27:12.235
Turgut Alp, we are ready to rest, sir.

01:27:12.635 --> 01:27:16.115
Very well. Two of you stand guard
while the others are eating.

01:27:16.795 --> 01:27:19.755
Then you'll sleep in turns.

01:27:21.435 --> 01:27:23.435
No one shuts their eyes tonight.

01:27:25.075 --> 01:27:27.675
-The goods we carry are of great value.
-Yes, sir.

01:27:56.365 --> 01:28:00.125
Latin Crusaders invaded Constantinople,
persecuting their fellow Christians.

01:28:01.365 --> 01:28:04.285
The Empire of Nicaea abhors the Crusaders,

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:09.125
hence the cooperation between
Sultan Kayqubad I and the Roman emperor.

01:28:10.925 --> 01:28:15.165
And we stand at the border,
the most dangerous place to be.

01:28:15.685 --> 01:28:20.765
But whoever controls these borders,
controls the future.

01:28:23.005 --> 01:28:27.205
Then what we must do is
catch John the Baptist

01:28:27.325 --> 01:28:29.685
and bring down his evil gang.

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:35.005
Sir, that's a sublime idea.
The only problem is we can't find him.

01:28:35.765 --> 01:28:38.645
Bamsi, we'll not only find him...

01:28:41.205 --> 01:28:44.605
...we'll bury him alive.

01:28:50.885 --> 01:28:52.085
You may come in, Dumrul.

01:28:56.125 --> 01:28:59.885
-Tell us about the marketplace.
-Sir, there was a commotion.

01:28:59.965 --> 01:29:02.525
I followed Tristan the Trader,
as per your orders,

01:29:02.605 --> 01:29:06.445
but I lost sight of him in the chaos.

01:29:12.605 --> 01:29:15.845
A man in a thawb followed Tristan closely.

01:29:16.725 --> 01:29:19.205
If it wasn't for me,
he would have been long dead.

01:29:23.725 --> 01:29:26.965
Surely he'll appear again.

01:29:28.565 --> 01:29:30.565
It will be a different man this time.

01:29:32.245 --> 01:29:34.685
Who could that be, Master Simon?
Any ideas?

01:29:36.405 --> 01:29:37.325
Yes.

01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:41.285
Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

01:29:42.885 --> 01:29:45.365
Who could it be, Bey? Any ideas?

01:29:47.765 --> 01:29:48.685
Yes.

01:29:51.405 --> 01:29:53.605
The owner of the marketplace, Simon.

01:29:54.205 --> 01:29:55.485
He has a hole in his ear

01:29:56.325 --> 01:29:58.405
and has had great success over the years.

01:29:58.885 --> 01:30:02.885
If he has armed troops as well,
then he either is John the Baptist...

01:30:03.925 --> 01:30:05.245
or...

01:30:05.725 --> 01:30:07.965
he serves under John the Baptist.

01:30:08.125 --> 01:30:10.605
We must get into their den.

01:30:13.445 --> 01:30:15.445
We must know for sure, Artuk Bey.

01:30:18.765 --> 01:30:21.245
He accomplished great feats
as soon as he arrived.

01:30:22.165 --> 01:30:24.725
He damaged the old hand, Ural.

01:30:25.405 --> 01:30:27.485
We must take action against him.

01:30:28.565 --> 01:30:33.005
Hasan, as a sound Muslim, it's your duty.

01:30:34.005 --> 01:30:36.085
Yes, Master Simon.

01:30:39.085 --> 01:30:40.445
As you wish.

01:30:43.805 --> 01:30:45.885
I've caught everyone's attention now,

01:30:46.605 --> 01:30:49.645
especially since I sold the produce
to the Venetians.

01:30:53.045 --> 01:30:54.965
Just a little longer, my brave Alps.

01:30:56.365 --> 01:30:57.645
Just a little.

01:30:57.725 --> 01:31:00.845
But sir, for what?

01:31:05.405 --> 01:31:07.125
For the resurrection, Bamsi.

01:31:09.325 --> 01:31:10.885
For the rebirth of a nation!

01:31:11.045 --> 01:31:12.365
<i>Ya Allah!</i>

01:31:25.165 --> 01:31:28.245
-Father, do I have your permission?
-You may sit.

01:31:36.645 --> 01:31:39.805
First Ural, now Aslıhan.

01:31:40.645 --> 01:31:45.885
It's like I have been slapped
on both cheeks by my children.

01:31:47.445 --> 01:31:49.245
I'm not going to beat around the bush.

01:31:49.965 --> 01:31:55.005
This is the turning point in our lives.

01:31:57.605 --> 01:32:01.925
Either we go down in flames
because of these heathens,

01:32:02.565 --> 01:32:04.605
or we learn to stand up against them.

01:32:05.805 --> 01:32:09.565
There is no way around it.

01:32:11.005 --> 01:32:16.845
Our blessed Tatar tribe
has withstood all kinds of mishaps.

01:32:18.965 --> 01:32:25.645
But now, my own kin have
turned against each other in my marquee.

01:32:26.205 --> 01:32:27.685
-Father--
-That's not true.

01:32:27.765 --> 01:32:28.965
Do not interrupt me!

01:32:30.245 --> 01:32:35.205
Listen to me. Pull yourselves together!

01:32:35.845 --> 01:32:40.205
Shatter the earth with each step you take!

01:32:41.685 --> 01:32:48.005
With a single strike,
lay waste to your enemies!

01:32:50.125 --> 01:32:54.365
Unite, or perish as the losers!

01:32:57.725 --> 01:32:59.965
-Ural.
-Sir.

01:33:00.725 --> 01:33:04.325
From this point onwards,
you will be responsible for trade,

01:33:04.485 --> 01:33:09.645
as well as the safety
of our people and Alps.

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:14.165
Your wife shall lead the carpet weavers.

01:33:15.725 --> 01:33:21.845
Aslıhan is stripped away from all duties,
except for the cleaning of the marquee.

01:33:24.845 --> 01:33:26.405
I don't deserve this.

01:33:27.165 --> 01:33:30.725
Now, you would do well to
make the best of what you have left.

01:33:33.765 --> 01:33:37.565
Father, I can assure you that
I will carry out my duty properly.

01:33:41.525 --> 01:33:43.685
I know Toktamış Bey is irreplaceable.

01:33:44.245 --> 01:33:48.325
However, it's our duty do our best to
be an sufficient substitute for him.

01:33:49.725 --> 01:33:50.925
On point, son.

01:33:52.045 --> 01:33:54.925
That's why I will assign Aliyar that duty.

01:33:59.285 --> 01:34:04.565
Together, we will make the decisions
regarding our future.

01:34:10.685 --> 01:34:12.605
Of course, I'll not forget to
consult you as well.

01:34:13.045 --> 01:34:16.925
However, Aliyar is the absolute
decision-maker from now on.

01:34:20.125 --> 01:34:22.885
Dad, don't make me do this, please.

01:34:24.405 --> 01:34:28.365
You know I've been meaning to
go to Qahira.

01:34:28.725 --> 01:34:32.165
Not only am I not ready to
take on such a duty,

01:34:32.325 --> 01:34:33.485
-I'm also not--
-Enough!

01:34:35.485 --> 01:34:42.125
The days of us fighting
for our lives are not far away.

01:34:43.965 --> 01:34:46.325
Either we all live together
or die together.

01:34:46.925 --> 01:34:49.285
Reviving our settlement in Cavdar Plains

01:34:49.365 --> 01:34:52.485
and making the most of things
is the only way.

01:34:54.085 --> 01:34:55.565
Make no mistake!

01:35:00.125 --> 01:35:06.325
To these ends, everything is permissible,
even the spilling of blood.

01:35:21.805 --> 01:35:23.285
Lest you forget,

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:30.965
as the stone remains after the storm,
kinship remains after all else is gone.

01:35:41.365 --> 01:35:44.325
Head to the market
tomorrow and see what's up.

01:35:45.125 --> 01:35:46.405
You must learn the ropes.

01:36:09.285 --> 01:36:10.565
Brother...

01:36:11.565 --> 01:36:14.085
Don't do anything stupid.

01:36:14.445 --> 01:36:16.285
We need you.

01:36:17.685 --> 01:36:22.325
Only you can save us
from the greed of Ural

01:36:22.725 --> 01:36:24.485
and the blind ambition
of Çolpan Hatun.

01:36:25.485 --> 01:36:28.805
If you leave, you won't
be able to come back here,

01:36:29.645 --> 01:36:32.685
nor will you ever see us
if you return.

01:36:54.645 --> 01:36:55.965
Aykiz...

01:36:56.805 --> 01:36:59.045
May God let us stay together forever.

01:36:59.845 --> 01:37:04.405
<i>I shall not live to see another day</i>
<i>without your love.</i>

01:37:22.325 --> 01:37:23.565
We are being attacked!

01:37:27.325 --> 01:37:28.565
Protect the rugs!

01:37:28.645 --> 01:37:30.405
-We're being attacked!
-We're being attacked!

01:41:42.525 --> 01:41:45.285
Take away the bodies.
We're not leaving them.

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:46.725
Yes, sir.

01:42:45.205 --> 01:42:47.805
-Did my son fall asleep?
-Finally, thank God.

01:42:50.085 --> 01:42:51.965
He won't stay still, Ertuğrul.

01:42:52.165 --> 01:42:55.045
He's become such a rascal.

01:42:56.285 --> 01:42:57.565
This is nothing, Halime.

01:42:59.205 --> 01:43:03.565
This is just the first.
There will be a second, third...

01:43:05.005 --> 01:43:08.765
fourth, fifth...

01:43:09.085 --> 01:43:11.765
The prophet wants their ummah
to prosper and grow

01:43:12.325 --> 01:43:16.085
so that we can
bring justice to these realms.

01:43:20.565 --> 01:43:23.645
I hope so. I really do.

01:43:31.565 --> 01:43:34.125
Ertuğrul, what keeps you
so deep in thought?

01:43:36.965 --> 01:43:38.085
Turgut Alp.

01:43:39.165 --> 01:43:43.005
He's been sulking ever since Aykiz died.

01:43:44.405 --> 01:43:45.645
He was captured once.

01:43:47.285 --> 01:43:51.605
He almost lost his mind,
but stayed with me, nevertheless.

01:43:55.925 --> 01:43:58.045
I want to bring my brother back to life.

01:43:59.285 --> 01:44:01.245
Get him to marry and father children.

01:44:02.765 --> 01:44:07.405
Sure, but there is no woman here
befitting Turgut.

01:44:10.765 --> 01:44:12.445
We can search the nearby settlements.

01:44:13.325 --> 01:44:16.765
-Hopefully, we can find him a good woman.
-I hope so.

01:44:18.125 --> 01:44:20.645
Once he returns safe and sound
with the rugs,

01:44:21.485 --> 01:44:22.965
we'll see what we can do.

01:44:34.485 --> 01:44:38.165
Like I said, brother, he was
fighting to the death like a madman.

01:44:38.245 --> 01:44:40.845
If my father didn't act quickly...

01:44:42.605 --> 01:44:44.445
we could've lost a family member.

01:44:45.405 --> 01:44:48.805
Something tells me that Toktamış
was poisoned, Aslıhan.

01:44:49.605 --> 01:44:53.645
I wouldn't be surprised.
Whoever profited off of his death...

01:44:55.405 --> 01:44:56.525
Aslıhan.

01:44:57.485 --> 01:45:01.205
Don't ever judge people on a whim.

01:45:02.125 --> 01:45:03.165
Understood?

01:45:04.005 --> 01:45:09.965
Everybody is innocent
until proven otherwise.

01:45:10.765 --> 01:45:15.365
It doesn't matter if he was
poisoned or not. He still attacked us.

01:45:20.925 --> 01:45:22.805
It does matter, but then again...

01:45:24.005 --> 01:45:25.245
maybe it doesn't.

01:45:27.165 --> 01:45:28.645
We shall see.

01:45:29.645 --> 01:45:33.645
But a voice in my head tells me that
we should look into this matter closely.

01:45:34.405 --> 01:45:36.045
We must see what's up.

01:45:39.445 --> 01:45:44.725
Brother, I hope that voice in your head
also tells you not to leave this place.

01:45:45.845 --> 01:45:47.205
If you were to go...

01:45:49.165 --> 01:45:50.405
I'd be left all alone.

01:45:54.445 --> 01:45:58.325
So, what happened at the marketplace?
Who is this Ertuğrul my brother detests?

01:45:59.245 --> 01:46:00.725
The leader of the Kayi tribe.

01:46:02.405 --> 01:46:03.645
He's a nimble man.

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:07.405
He has fought and defeated many enemies.

01:46:08.645 --> 01:46:09.925
A determined man.

01:46:15.445 --> 01:46:16.965
I shall go there tomorrow myself

01:46:17.525 --> 01:46:19.965
and see with my own two eyes.

01:46:35.325 --> 01:46:36.845
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:46:36.965 --> 01:46:42.845
I know every inch of this place.

01:46:44.405 --> 01:46:47.005
Gold is heavier than sand,

01:46:47.605 --> 01:46:52.565
so there is more gold
to be found in weaker streams.

01:46:53.245 --> 01:46:57.645
We should start by combing the Ayi stream

01:46:58.045 --> 01:47:00.445
that flows around the Gedik well.

01:47:02.165 --> 01:47:06.325
That stream may be weak, but it's deep,
Foreman Haçaturyan.

01:47:06.605 --> 01:47:08.245
It's not an easy feat to find the bottom.

01:47:08.925 --> 01:47:14.645
You're right, Artuk Bey, but the stream
turns and twists like a snake.

01:47:15.245 --> 01:47:17.365
Rocks stand high at those bends.

01:47:18.005 --> 01:47:22.205
When the rocks are high,
the stream loses its depth.

01:47:23.725 --> 01:47:27.845
Gold hides in the nooks and crannies
of those rocks.

01:47:28.405 --> 01:47:31.965
All we must do then is pan the sands.

01:47:36.525 --> 01:47:38.965
They say it's easy to extract the gold.

01:47:39.285 --> 01:47:41.285
Why, then, has nobody done this until now?

01:47:42.845 --> 01:47:48.125
Because gold is skittish, Dündar Bey.
It moves around all the time.

01:47:48.805 --> 01:47:51.845
If you don't know where it hides,

01:47:53.125 --> 01:47:55.845
all you'll get is a handful of sand.

01:47:56.845 --> 01:48:03.165
So, you have to put the sun,
wind and rain into consideration.

01:48:05.925 --> 01:48:07.925
Winter is coming, Foreman Haçaturyan.

01:48:08.405 --> 01:48:12.205
Once the rain starts to fall,
the streams surge.

01:48:13.845 --> 01:48:15.685
We must be quick.

01:48:16.365 --> 01:48:19.725
Right on point, sir. It's just as you say.

01:48:20.285 --> 01:48:22.685
The best time is the end of summer.

01:48:23.845 --> 01:48:30.325
If we find the right spot,
gold should come to us in piles.

01:48:33.085 --> 01:48:36.725
Dündar, escort Foreman Haçaturyan
with the other Alps.

01:48:37.605 --> 01:48:39.645
See to it that he's provided
with all he needs.

01:48:40.125 --> 01:48:43.685
Protect him and keep this a secret.

01:48:45.845 --> 01:48:47.245
As you wish, sir.

01:49:06.565 --> 01:49:09.845
The rocks you stub your feet against
will soon turn to sand, sir.

01:49:10.765 --> 01:49:12.805
We can crush those rocks
at any time, Colpan.

01:49:13.605 --> 01:49:16.325
Now is the time for patience.

01:49:21.245 --> 01:49:22.965
Sir, can I have a moment?

01:49:29.205 --> 01:49:31.125
I carried out your orders.

01:49:31.325 --> 01:49:34.645
We burned the rugs
and killed the Venetians and Alps.

01:49:38.125 --> 01:49:41.845
-And you weren't seen, right?
-Not a soul saw us.

01:49:42.685 --> 01:49:45.125
And we took care of the rest.

01:50:51.645 --> 01:50:53.205
What's this smoke?

01:50:56.485 --> 01:50:57.405
Follow me.

01:52:01.165 --> 01:52:02.085
All dead.

01:52:20.565 --> 01:52:23.645
Turgut? Turgut!

01:52:28.805 --> 01:52:29.685
He is alive!

01:52:38.645 --> 01:52:40.245
Don't worry. You'll live.

01:52:45.285 --> 01:52:49.045
Let him die. It's all in accordance
with Master Simon's wishes.

01:52:49.125 --> 01:52:50.605
Are you dumb, Philip?

01:52:52.525 --> 01:52:54.765
If we take him to my brother,
he'll appreciate it.

01:53:08.925 --> 01:53:11.045
He'll be delighted.

01:53:13.645 --> 01:53:14.925
Absolutely delighted.

01:53:19.965 --> 01:53:21.245
Now give me a hand!

01:53:45.605 --> 01:53:46.845
What does it say?

01:53:52.805 --> 01:53:56.045
The man who raided Saint Petruchio's
Templar stronghold in Antakya

01:53:56.125 --> 01:53:58.805
and killed Titus and our brothers
turns out to be Ertuğrul.

01:53:59.805 --> 01:54:04.125
We must take precautions. Ertuğrul might
just be the spy we're looking for.

01:54:07.685 --> 01:54:10.125
Then it's time to move.

01:54:10.765 --> 01:54:12.725
If Ertuğrul turns out to be the spy,

01:54:13.285 --> 01:54:17.165
it'll be two presents in one
from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

01:54:36.525 --> 01:54:38.885
Have faith that God will make
the best decision for us.

01:55:23.245 --> 01:55:29.845
In the 99 names of He
who gives life and fills us with faith.

01:55:35.445 --> 01:55:36.765
In the name of God.

01:55:42.405 --> 01:55:43.805
Brave sons of Kayi!

01:55:45.645 --> 01:55:47.805
For so long, we've been
on foot, traveling.

01:55:49.525 --> 01:55:51.325
We have defeated our enemies...

01:55:52.965 --> 01:55:55.445
punished lawless rascals...

01:55:58.645 --> 01:56:00.925
and eliminated many traitors.

01:56:02.005 --> 01:56:06.925
And now, at last, a bright future
awaits us.

01:56:10.925 --> 01:56:13.165
These lands are like no other.

01:56:15.125 --> 01:56:16.885
We are not far from our enemies.

01:56:20.205 --> 01:56:22.685
The battles here will be
nothing like what we know.

01:56:23.725 --> 01:56:28.005
Therefore, we must adapt
to the state of things.

01:56:29.725 --> 01:56:33.965
With respect, sir, we have devoted
our lives to your ideals.

01:56:34.685 --> 01:56:36.885
You asked us to die for you,
and we are ready to.

01:56:37.525 --> 01:56:40.965
However, we ask one thing of you,
and one thing only.

01:56:42.485 --> 01:56:43.765
Go on, Karabey.

01:56:43.845 --> 01:56:46.405
Don't deny us when we ask for a meeting.

01:56:48.805 --> 01:56:51.245
Meetings are our traditional way.

01:56:52.925 --> 01:56:55.325
A Bey does not act
without consulting others.

01:56:56.965 --> 01:56:58.805
I'm of the same opinion, sir.

01:56:59.685 --> 01:57:02.845
A Bey who does not consult others
is not a Bey at all.

01:57:38.405 --> 01:57:39.805
Noble men of my tribe.

01:57:42.965 --> 01:57:44.645
I see that I have upset the lot of you.

01:57:45.605 --> 01:57:51.965
The reason I have not held any meetings
is the secret war that I've been fighting.

01:57:53.085 --> 01:57:54.405
You must know that first.

01:57:55.725 --> 01:58:01.405
However, from this point onwards,
I shall not turn you away anymore.

01:58:04.925 --> 01:58:06.485
Thanks to God Almighty,

01:58:07.405 --> 01:58:10.445
there are men that stand up
for their ideals in my tribe.

01:58:11.485 --> 01:58:16.485
As long as you stand here
in the name of justice,

01:58:17.285 --> 01:58:19.285
no one will bring us to our knees.

01:58:23.045 --> 01:58:24.445
May you live long.

01:58:31.365 --> 01:58:32.245
Abdurrahman.

01:58:33.885 --> 01:58:37.085
-Bring me the chest for the distribution.
-As you wish, sir.

02:00:12.405 --> 02:00:14.365
We found Turgut by the roadside, brother.

02:00:15.685 --> 02:00:17.285
I thought he might be useful.

02:00:18.405 --> 02:00:23.205
Just as you predicted, Ural had
the Venetians and Alps killed.

02:00:24.965 --> 02:00:28.365
Well done, Maria. I've raised you well.

02:00:29.365 --> 02:00:31.125
Take this man inside immediately.

02:00:31.565 --> 02:00:34.045
-Philip.
-Sir.

02:00:34.845 --> 02:00:37.605
Head over to the Kayi Tribe
and find Ertuğrul Bey.

02:00:37.965 --> 02:00:40.325
Tell him that we found one of his men
heavily wounded.

02:00:41.245 --> 02:00:46.125
Anton, take some men with you
and bring the corpses to me in a cart.

02:00:46.565 --> 02:00:48.325
Yes, Master Simon.

02:00:49.045 --> 02:00:52.205
We must make sure Ertuğrul
knows that we respect him.

02:00:53.405 --> 02:00:57.365
I found this knife near Turgut.

02:00:57.925 --> 02:01:00.325
The seal of the Cavdar tribe
is on the hilt.

02:01:00.565 --> 02:01:04.245
Now we can play with Ural
like a cat plays with a mouse.

02:01:06.005 --> 02:01:10.565
Not just with Ural, but with Ertuğrul,
the Sultan's spy, as well.

02:01:40.685 --> 02:01:44.765
-Ural, oh, how I missed you!
-Will you go back to Nicaea?

02:01:45.605 --> 02:01:48.205
I'm not leaving you again.

02:01:48.485 --> 02:01:49.805
Look, I got you something.

02:01:54.365 --> 02:01:55.445
Ural...

02:01:56.325 --> 02:02:00.125
These are the shoes that I've been
dreaming about since forever!

02:02:02.085 --> 02:02:05.405
I would grant you any wish, Amanda.

02:02:07.485 --> 02:02:08.605
Any news from the market?

02:02:09.845 --> 02:02:13.405
Maria and Philip brought in
a wounded man this morning.

02:02:13.565 --> 02:02:16.485
-Who?
-A man named Turgut.

02:02:19.365 --> 02:02:20.485
What did you just say?

02:02:42.765 --> 02:02:45.125
Where is it? Where is it?!

02:02:45.725 --> 02:02:49.005
Where is this accursed knife?! Damn it!

02:02:57.765 --> 02:03:01.165
Turgut is alive, you fuckers!
And you told me you killed them all!

02:03:04.405 --> 02:03:07.005
But sir, that's impossible!
We killed them all.

02:03:07.085 --> 02:03:10.925
We burned their rugs.
I killed Turgut personally.

02:03:11.005 --> 02:03:13.765
I know when I cut a man.
What are you talking about?

02:03:13.845 --> 02:03:17.285
Then what the hell is Turgut doing at
the inn, you imbecile?!

02:03:35.005 --> 02:03:36.525
Simon, you called for me?

02:03:39.565 --> 02:03:41.245
Apparently, your rugs were burned.

02:03:42.725 --> 02:03:43.565
What?

02:03:44.525 --> 02:03:46.005
And two of your men died.

02:03:46.365 --> 02:03:48.525
The bodies are being retrieved
as we speak.

02:03:50.405 --> 02:03:51.605
Ertuğrul!

02:03:51.685 --> 02:03:55.085
He gave his word
that he would cover any damages.

02:03:55.525 --> 02:03:58.205
So, he's obliged to.

02:04:02.405 --> 02:04:06.485
Sir, I can feel it! This is the place!

02:04:07.565 --> 02:04:10.365
It's here! Come on, son.
This is the place.

02:04:10.445 --> 02:04:12.205
Come on! Come on!

02:04:16.445 --> 02:04:19.245
Come on, son! It's here!

02:04:32.125 --> 02:04:33.925
This is the place, Dündar Bey!

02:04:35.845 --> 02:04:38.645
We've found it!

02:04:39.805 --> 02:04:42.005
The gold is here.

02:04:42.085 --> 02:04:45.045
It has to be here.

02:04:50.645 --> 02:04:53.765
The gold is here. It's all here.

02:04:56.645 --> 02:04:58.165
It's here!

02:05:01.325 --> 02:05:03.485
It's here!

02:05:29.045 --> 02:05:30.085
It's not here either.

02:05:34.045 --> 02:05:36.245
Here, here it is.

02:05:38.725 --> 02:05:42.245
Where is it? It has to be here!

02:05:45.125 --> 02:05:47.005
It has to be here!

02:05:48.685 --> 02:05:52.965
It was here! Where is it?
Sir, it was here!

02:05:54.685 --> 02:05:56.645
It was here, Dündar Bey!

02:05:58.125 --> 02:06:00.045
I was wrong, again, Dündar Bey.

02:06:00.845 --> 02:06:02.045
But I know.

02:06:02.685 --> 02:06:07.205
I know the stream with gold
that I found is around here.

02:06:07.765 --> 02:06:10.485
If you could just
give me a bit more time, sir,

02:06:10.965 --> 02:06:13.605
I will find the gold before the sunset.

02:06:27.725 --> 02:06:30.085
-May I enter, sir?
-Come.

02:06:45.445 --> 02:06:48.285
What is it, Aliyar? Speak up.

02:06:52.125 --> 02:06:54.965
Father, they raided the caravans
transporting the Kayis' rugs.

02:06:56.045 --> 02:06:57.725
They murdered their Alps.

02:07:00.565 --> 02:07:03.005
What kind of treacherous
thief could do this?

02:07:03.765 --> 02:07:07.525
Theft is not the problem, father.
The rugs were all burned.

02:07:09.245 --> 02:07:15.525
Why would they raid the caravan
if not for the rugs?

02:07:21.845 --> 02:07:23.285
Ural!

02:07:24.605 --> 02:07:26.085
You are right, Father.

02:07:27.925 --> 02:07:30.245
I overheard my brother, Ural,
and Batuhan speaking.

02:07:40.165 --> 02:07:42.485
If Ertuğrul catches wind of this...

02:07:44.085 --> 02:07:46.805
It will not end well
for either of our Muslim tribes.

02:07:49.205 --> 02:07:52.925
Especially since
we're surrounded by infidels.

02:07:56.725 --> 02:07:58.205
The Cavdar tribe is bigger.

02:07:59.445 --> 02:08:03.245
The Kayis have no chance of winning,
but you are right.

02:08:03.885 --> 02:08:08.925
And if Ertuğrul Bey hears of this,
there can obviously be no victors.

02:08:14.485 --> 02:08:15.485
Listen well, Aliyar.

02:08:16.645 --> 02:08:19.605
Go find Ertuğrul Bey
and tell him this:

02:08:20.365 --> 02:08:24.725
"Candar Bey would be happy to
invite you over for dinner

02:08:24.925 --> 02:08:27.445
in order to get to know your family.

02:08:28.365 --> 02:08:33.085
He'd be honored to have a brave man
such as yourself over for dinner."

02:08:35.045 --> 02:08:36.045
Got it?

02:09:19.448 --> 02:09:21.208
Your sword will protect
not just your chest

02:09:22.448 --> 02:09:26.528
but your back as well,
so make sure you keep an eye on your back.

02:09:40.168 --> 02:09:41.528
Dad!

02:09:43.728 --> 02:09:46.728
You'll be the master of Zulfiqar swords
one day, just like Daddy.

02:09:47.408 --> 02:09:53.368
You'll swing your sword in the name
of justice, like your uncles and grandpa.

02:10:18.528 --> 02:10:20.568
Ertuğrul Bey, you have a visitor.

02:10:34.248 --> 02:10:37.168
Sir, isn't that the guy
who was with Simon?

02:10:37.808 --> 02:10:39.648
Let's see what he has to say.

02:10:48.688 --> 02:10:53.568
Sir, with your permission,
this man wants to see you.

02:10:54.288 --> 02:10:57.568
His name is Philip.
He says he works with the innkeeper Simon.

02:10:59.528 --> 02:11:00.608
You may speak, Philip.

02:11:12.288 --> 02:11:17.888
Ertuğrul Bey, I bring you
Master Simon's regards.

02:11:20.288 --> 02:11:23.648
Received. So, what's wrong?

02:11:29.048 --> 02:11:31.768
On the way to Constantinople,
the Alps that were escorting your rugs...

02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:38.830
they were attacked.

02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:41.190
What, did he say attacked?

02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:46.270
No!

02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:49.070
Unbelievable.

02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:52.870
How is that possible?

02:11:57.790 --> 02:11:59.310
We must take revenge.

02:12:02.100 --> 02:12:05.140
Silence! Can't you see Bey is talking?

02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:14.900
Unfortunately, all your Alps were killed.
