1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 88 will start after 12:32 min.

2
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:50,099
This is the end of your fame, Ertuğrul.

3
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:52,419
You can take all the fame.

4
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,979
Martyrdom will suffice for us.

5
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:10,059
Come on!

6
00:13:58,099 --> 00:13:59,539
Where are these arrows coming from?

7
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:28,899
Attack!

8
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:40,339
Sultan!

9
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,299
Who are they, Nikolas?

10
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:59,539
They have more men than us,
we will lose. Let's go.

11
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:01,259
We won't lose! Attack!

12
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:51,699
Just a bit more, Halime Sultan.

13
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:53,499
Keep pushing.

14
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:54,899
-A bit more.
-Breathe.

15
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:56,179
Push.

16
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:57,459
Push, Halime.

17
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:59,099
-Come on.
-Come on.

18
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:08,284
Congratulations, Halime.

19
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:12,699
Dear God!

20
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,499
-Thank God.
-Congratulations, Halime Sultan.

21
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:19,339
He's a boy.

22
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:35,339
God bless.

23
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:37,619
God bless him.

24
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:41,739
My love.

25
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,139
God bless.

26
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,139
God bless.

27
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,179
My love.

28
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:50,779
How sweet!

29
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:05,779
Surrender, Ertuğrul.

30
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:09,619
There's no way out.

31
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,739
We only surrender to God, Vasilius.

32
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,659
To the last of our breath.

33
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:37,539
Ertuğrul!

34
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,499
This is just the beginning.

35
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:54,299
Aliyar Bey! Brother!

36
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:56,179
Brother!

37
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:57,779
Brother!

38
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:00,139
We must retreat, Vasilius.

39
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,899
No. Either he dies, or I die.

40
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:05,139
For our cause, Vasilius. Come on.

41
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:06,579
Come on.

42
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,139
You are coming with me.

43
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:27,819
Ishak!

44
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:32,859
Ishak!

45
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:40,059
Abdur Rahman, Bamsi. Come with me.

46
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:02,648
I love you so much, my baby boy.

47
00:25:03,728 --> 00:25:05,088
Look at those silky hands.

48
00:25:08,848 --> 00:25:10,408
That heavenly smell.

49
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:13,288
Healthy and beautiful.

50
00:25:14,408 --> 00:25:16,128
God bless you.

51
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:22,088
Come on, hop in to your mother's arms.

52
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:25,488
God bless.

53
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,368
May God let him grow with his parents.

54
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:33,848
Here, take him.

55
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:40,208
I love you so much, my baby boy.

56
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:50,808
Mother.

57
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:53,528
Has Ertuğrul returned yet?

58
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:57,608
He will, my dear. Be patient.

59
00:25:58,048 --> 00:25:59,408
Don't worry.

60
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:00,608
Okay.

61
00:26:05,728 --> 00:26:10,328
Please God, I beg you.

62
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:14,808
Let him return safe and sound
and see his son.

63
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:16,928
Amen.

64
00:26:18,008 --> 00:26:19,728
Please protect him

65
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,808
and his friends from the evil doers.

66
00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:24,608
Amen.

67
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:28,448
Let's be strong now.

68
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:30,928
They will surely come back.

69
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:32,608
I hope so.

70
00:26:32,688 --> 00:26:34,408
-Hopefully, my dear.
-Hopefully.

71
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:38,128
Aliyar Bey, open your eyes.

72
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:39,528
Aliyar Bey.

73
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:45,088
He's alive.

74
00:27:45,728 --> 00:27:47,328
Put more pressure on it.

75
00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:49,848
Sir.

76
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:53,648
He's lost too much blood,
and his wound is deep.

77
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:55,608
The bastard got away.

78
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:05,608
Turgut.

79
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:10,888
Slowly.

80
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,808
Easy.

81
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:14,848
You've gone through worse than this.

82
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:16,928
Come on.

83
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,088
God bless you, Your Highness.

84
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:30,288
If it weren't for you--

85
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,888
Ebu Mansur, Ertuğrul Bey.

86
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:34,088
Call me that for now.

87
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:37,288
We aided you, but God saved you.

88
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,368
We'll talk at the camp.

89
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:42,048
Yes, sir.

90
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:46,328
Ishak.

91
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:48,968
We're going back to the camp.
Carry the wounded.

92
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,688
-Come on, brother.
-Come on.

93
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:52,368
-Don't be rough.
-Up.

94
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:55,488
Help.

95
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:01,088
God bless.

96
00:29:01,728 --> 00:29:03,528
Such a healthy boy.

97
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:06,208
May he live with his mother and father.

98
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:07,368
Amen.

99
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,208
Amen. Thank you, dear.

100
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:14,808
Next is Banu Çiçek, God willing.

101
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,368
Hopefully.

102
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,888
Thank God you are with us, Mother Hayme.

103
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,008
My first grandson.

104
00:29:26,128 --> 00:29:28,368
Come here, look who is here.

105
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,408
Gündüz.

106
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:31,008
Is this my brother?

107
00:29:32,088 --> 00:29:34,688
I need soldiers. Let me have a look.

108
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:35,728
Look.

109
00:29:39,448 --> 00:29:41,768
Let me make my brother a sword.

110
00:29:41,888 --> 00:29:44,088
You take care of him now.

111
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:45,248
Okay.

112
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,808
As little as he may be,
he's already acting all high and mighty.

113
00:29:56,448 --> 00:29:58,368
May God never let them suffer.

114
00:29:58,488 --> 00:29:59,608
Amen.

115
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:01,248
Amen.

116
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:05,688
Ertuğrul Bey will be overjoyed to see him.

117
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:08,088
Mother.

118
00:30:08,968 --> 00:30:11,328
Is there any news from them?

119
00:30:11,688 --> 00:30:13,168
When will they come back?

120
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,368
After I lost my father,
I can't bear more of this pain.

121
00:30:26,288 --> 00:30:28,648
May God let them get back safely.

122
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:36,568
Do not tempt fate, dear.

123
00:30:53,608 --> 00:30:55,048
What could it be?

124
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:57,448
Nothing bad, I hope.

125
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:41,888
Please God, protect my children.

126
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,528
It's Aliyar Bey.

127
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
It's Aliyar Bey.

128
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:14,368
Aliyar Bey is wounded.

129
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:16,088
Who did this?

130
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:17,888
Make way.

131
00:32:45,648 --> 00:32:47,568
-Aliyar!
-Aliyar!

132
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:49,728
Oh, my God!

133
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:51,768
-Brother!
-Son.

134
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:54,968
Please, open your eyes, brother.

135
00:32:55,128 --> 00:32:56,208
Artuk Bey!

136
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,488
Don't leave me alone.

137
00:32:58,928 --> 00:33:00,528
-Brother.
-Make way.

138
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:01,448
Brother.

139
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,888
-Take him to the healing tent.
-Right away.

140
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:07,408
Ishak, you take care
of the wounded. Hurry up!

141
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:08,448
-Get him up.
-Up.

142
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,048
-Be quick about it.
-Don't rock it.

143
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,728
Don't be rough.

144
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:20,728
How is Halime Sultan, Mother?

145
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:24,928
You have a beautiful and healthy son.

146
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,968
Halime is okay, too.

147
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:30,008
Go and see your wife.

148
00:34:00,568 --> 00:34:01,448
Ertuğrul...

149
00:34:01,888 --> 00:34:03,168
Don't get up, Halime.

150
00:34:05,848 --> 00:34:07,888
Thank God you are back.
Welcome back.

151
00:34:08,408 --> 00:34:09,528
Thank you.

152
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:24,968
Son.

153
00:34:26,888 --> 00:34:28,048
My son.

154
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:32,008
My baby son.

155
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:42,848
You and our son have been
on my mind the entire time, Halime.

156
00:34:43,808 --> 00:34:47,368
Now that I have seen you're well,
I'd die a happy man.

157
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:51,048
And I've been waiting for you
to come back, Ertuğrul.

158
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:56,528
I prayed to God to let you
see our son.

159
00:35:00,928 --> 00:35:05,248
Sometimes, we must leave
our loved ones behind for the cause.

160
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:09,848
Ertuğrul, you are following God's cause.

161
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,608
Now that you are back alive and well,
that's good enough.

162
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:20,968
What happened?

163
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:22,928
You look sad.

164
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,448
Vasilius.

165
00:35:27,648 --> 00:35:29,568
He found out where we were going.

166
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:33,008
We fell into his trap.

167
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:36,488
If it weren't for Ebu Mansur,

168
00:35:37,808 --> 00:35:39,088
we'd have been done for.

169
00:35:40,448 --> 00:35:44,008
Ebu Mansur? Who is that?

170
00:35:45,888 --> 00:35:48,688
I told you before that I knew about him.

171
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:52,608
But how did it turn out like this?

172
00:35:56,848 --> 00:35:57,848
Aliyar Bey...

173
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:01,528
is wounded.

174
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:04,848
He's badly hurt.

175
00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:16,608
How many times has it been Nikolas?

176
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,688
Just how many times?

177
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:22,608
How many more times are we going to
return with dead bodies

178
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:25,048
when instead we should be
taking Ertuğrul's head?

179
00:36:25,168 --> 00:36:26,168
How many times?

180
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:28,088
-Sir.
-What?

181
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:31,248
Apologies,
there is a messenger from Nicaea.

182
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:34,648
He said he had information
that he could only tell you.

183
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:39,088
A letter from the emperor for you, sir.

184
00:36:41,928 --> 00:36:42,968
Leave.

185
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:49,128
God damn the emperor
and his cursed letter!

186
00:36:55,688 --> 00:36:58,728
It all changed when he arrived.

187
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:01,648
We wouldn't have lost if
it weren't for him.

188
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:05,248
You could have taken...

189
00:37:05,928 --> 00:37:07,208
Ertuğrul's life.

190
00:37:08,568 --> 00:37:10,368
Ebu Mansur.

191
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:12,848
He's supposedly a merchant.

192
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:16,128
But his real identity is a mystery.

193
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:23,768
I don't know who he is,
but it's obvious what he is not.

194
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:27,608
He's not a merchant,

195
00:37:28,488 --> 00:37:30,088
but a warrior.

196
00:37:32,328 --> 00:37:34,568
Is there even a soldier here
that fights as well as him?

197
00:37:35,928 --> 00:37:38,008
He's not from around here, Nikolas.

198
00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:40,528
They were the sultan's men.

199
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:44,088
They're coming to take my fort.

200
00:37:45,368 --> 00:37:47,888
An advance party.
There'll be more if we don't stop them.

201
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:50,568
Then, the one called Ebu Mansur

202
00:37:50,928 --> 00:37:53,648
must be one of the best commanders
of the sultan.

203
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:58,808
No, more than a commander.

204
00:38:00,248 --> 00:38:03,128
Someone more important
and with more power.

205
00:38:05,008 --> 00:38:06,008
But who?

206
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:11,688
-We'll find out.
-How?

207
00:38:12,488 --> 00:38:14,328
We don't even know where he is.

208
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:19,408
Where could a man wearing
merchant clothes stay?

209
00:38:19,928 --> 00:38:21,688
At Hanlı Bazaar, of course.

210
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:25,208
Send two men after him
and watch him right away.

211
00:38:38,328 --> 00:38:39,808
Read this, sir.

212
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:03,768
Sultan Alaeddin, huh?

213
00:39:08,328 --> 00:39:11,088
In disguise amongst commoners.

214
00:39:17,968 --> 00:39:19,488
What's the meaning of this?

215
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:24,048
We now know Ebu Mansur's identity,
that is what it means.

216
00:39:27,888 --> 00:39:29,088
That man...

217
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:31,928
Is that even possible?

218
00:39:32,928 --> 00:39:34,848
How brazen would he have to be?

219
00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:38,088
He'd never risk his life coming
all the way here.

220
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,088
-You are wrong, Vasilius.
-He would.

221
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:44,408
Sultan Alaeddin

222
00:39:44,808 --> 00:39:48,328
first wants to see the place
he'd like to conquer.

223
00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:49,808
He has done it before.

224
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:53,888
But now,

225
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:58,808
we must make sure it's him.

226
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:02,328
But how?
Is there anyone that would recognize him?

227
00:40:08,768 --> 00:40:10,408
Yes, Nikolas.

228
00:40:10,728 --> 00:40:12,168
There's someone.

229
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:56,248
We are honored to have you, Your Highness.

230
00:41:31,728 --> 00:41:32,808
Come.

231
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,568
Sit with Ebu Mansur.

232
00:41:47,688 --> 00:41:51,368
Ertuğrul Bey, I wish I didn't have to
show up on such a dreary day.

233
00:41:54,008 --> 00:41:55,728
How is Aliyar Bey?

234
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,488
He's in a bad condition, Your Highness.

235
00:42:02,528 --> 00:42:05,488
I hope to God that he recovers quickly.

236
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:07,168
I hope so.

237
00:42:07,728 --> 00:42:09,368
Never lose your hope.

238
00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:13,328
On the other hand,

239
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:16,808
the good news is that you have a son.

240
00:42:19,528 --> 00:42:21,208
I have one more son, Your Highness.

241
00:42:23,728 --> 00:42:24,648
May God...

242
00:42:25,768 --> 00:42:28,688
let him grow up to be a gallant warrior
such as yourself.

243
00:42:28,968 --> 00:42:29,968
Amen.

244
00:42:33,528 --> 00:42:34,808
Ertuğrul Bey.

245
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,248
What happened at the inn?

246
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,408
Tell me everything.

247
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:46,208
Your eye in Nicaea...

248
00:42:47,368 --> 00:42:49,008
was exposed, Your Highness.

249
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:51,888
He was on the run
from the emperor's soldiers.

250
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:54,608
He had something very important
to tell you.

251
00:42:55,248 --> 00:42:56,248
However,

252
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:59,888
Vasilius found him
before us and killed him.

253
00:43:01,928 --> 00:43:04,448
Could you find out
what he was going to tell me?

254
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,208
He sent me this seal with his comrade.

255
00:43:52,408 --> 00:43:53,448
Ertuğrul Bey.

256
00:43:54,888 --> 00:43:59,288
There's a traitor from the government
in the Sultan's castle.

257
00:44:01,128 --> 00:44:03,048
You must tell our Sultan quickly.

258
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,848
They tried to take my life twice.

259
00:44:26,128 --> 00:44:28,648
I suspected there was
a traitor in my castle.

260
00:44:29,608 --> 00:44:31,408
Now I have no more doubts.

261
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:37,008
They're attacking our country
from the east and west.

262
00:44:38,048 --> 00:44:40,928
As if that wasn't enough,

263
00:44:41,648 --> 00:44:43,608
we have a traitor now?

264
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:46,728
If that's how it is,

265
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:49,968
then it's dangerous
for you to be here, Your Highness.

266
00:45:01,128 --> 00:45:02,768
I am the real threat here,

267
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:06,408
for my enemies, Ertuğrul Bey.

268
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:12,488
I'll find out who is the traitor
in my castle, sooner or later.

269
00:45:15,928 --> 00:45:16,928
However,

270
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:19,408
the real issue today is...

271
00:45:20,288 --> 00:45:21,888
Karacahisar Castle.

272
00:45:23,248 --> 00:45:26,728
The fate of the Turkmen Tribes
rests on your decision, Your Highness.

273
00:45:28,088 --> 00:45:30,288
We tried to protect the peace
as per your orders.

274
00:45:30,968 --> 00:45:32,768
However, we lost many men.

275
00:45:34,128 --> 00:45:36,048
War is now inevitable.

276
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:40,248
I came here to see Karacahisar Castle
with my own eyes

277
00:45:40,368 --> 00:45:42,768
and give my final decision, Ertuğrul Bey.

278
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:46,408
I've talked to many men

279
00:45:47,008 --> 00:45:49,768
as Merchant Ebu Mansur
for the last five days.

280
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:52,928
My armies are preparing for war
in the east.

281
00:45:54,128 --> 00:45:57,368
Before I join my armies,
I'd like to consult you,

282
00:45:57,448 --> 00:45:58,928
my finest bey...

283
00:46:02,048 --> 00:46:04,128
that knows these lands.

284
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:06,768
Be my guest at the marquee, Your Highness.

285
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:11,648
We must keep this secret, Ertuğrul Bey.

286
00:46:15,528 --> 00:46:17,608
I'd like to stay at the inn
with the guards.

287
00:46:18,928 --> 00:46:22,568
But I'm worried about
Aliyar Bey's condition.

288
00:46:23,288 --> 00:46:24,848
I'll stay with your tribe tonight.

289
00:46:25,528 --> 00:46:27,088
However, not at your marquee,

290
00:46:27,608 --> 00:46:28,968
but in the guest tent.

291
00:46:30,968 --> 00:46:32,448
I don't want to attract any attention.

292
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:11,008
Gone!

293
00:47:12,328 --> 00:47:14,288
Slipped from our grasp!

294
00:47:15,568 --> 00:47:17,208
Killed our brothers!

295
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:19,168
They got Aliyar Bey as well.

296
00:47:20,728 --> 00:47:22,568
Aliyar Bey is still alive, Bamsi.

297
00:47:23,688 --> 00:47:25,208
Don't lose hope.

298
00:47:28,488 --> 00:47:30,568
If Ebu Mansur had not made it...

299
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:33,248
we would have died.

300
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:39,328
Who is that merchant?

301
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:41,648
Are you not curious?

302
00:47:41,888 --> 00:47:43,768
You are right, brother.

303
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:48,648
I've never seen a merchant
that fought so well.

304
00:47:49,768 --> 00:47:50,728
My brothers.

305
00:47:51,728 --> 00:47:53,248
If you ask me,

306
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:55,728
he is no merchant.

307
00:47:58,048 --> 00:48:00,288
He's not just clever, but strong as well.

308
00:48:02,168 --> 00:48:05,408
His speaks softly, but his mind is sharp.

309
00:48:06,248 --> 00:48:08,608
We spoke before the rug deal briefly.

310
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:10,848
He's both knowledgeable,
and a decent man.

311
00:48:11,008 --> 00:48:12,008
Yeah.

312
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:14,968
All their shots hit the mark, too.

313
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:19,448
Apparently, trading is not
their only occupation.

314
00:48:21,448 --> 00:48:23,408
They are all brave warriors.

315
00:48:23,688 --> 00:48:26,648
Ertuğrul Bey was stunned
to see Ebu Mansur.

316
00:48:28,648 --> 00:48:31,448
There must be an underlying reason
as to why he respects him so much.

317
00:48:38,968 --> 00:48:41,848
Come on, brothers. Dress your wounds.

318
00:48:42,888 --> 00:48:43,808
And then...

319
00:48:45,368 --> 00:48:46,848
pray for Aliyar Bey.

320
00:48:59,488 --> 00:49:00,488
Sir.

321
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,488
<i>Bismillah.</i>

322
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:35,928
Brother.

323
00:49:37,048 --> 00:49:37,968
Brother.

324
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:40,448
I beg you.

325
00:49:49,688 --> 00:49:50,808
Brother.

326
00:49:53,048 --> 00:49:56,848
Artuk Bey, please tell me
that he's going to live.

327
00:49:59,088 --> 00:50:01,688
He's the only one that...

328
00:50:03,608 --> 00:50:05,568
holds together our tattered tribe.

329
00:50:06,528 --> 00:50:08,128
If something happens to him,

330
00:50:09,408 --> 00:50:10,528
all this blood...

331
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:14,168
and these tears will have been in vain.

332
00:50:18,968 --> 00:50:21,408
His condition is bad, Aslıhan Hatun.

333
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:24,008
Be prepared, anything could happen.

334
00:50:24,808 --> 00:50:27,648
But don't lose hope.

335
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:48,288
Aliyar Bey shielded me
with his body in the battle.

336
00:50:49,968 --> 00:50:51,208
He cared about you...

337
00:50:52,128 --> 00:50:54,968
much more than he cared
about himself, Ertuğrul Bey.

338
00:51:00,888 --> 00:51:02,368
He wouldn't stop to think...

339
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:06,568
even if he had a thousand lives.

340
00:51:09,488 --> 00:51:10,448
It's the same...

341
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:12,968
for me as well.

342
00:51:17,048 --> 00:51:20,408
It's your duty
to hold your tribe together...

343
00:51:21,488 --> 00:51:24,288
until he recovers and comes back,
Aslıhan Hatun.

344
00:51:26,488 --> 00:51:29,008
Aliyar Bey chose you
as his representative.

345
00:51:31,528 --> 00:51:34,488
Don't let all the blood spilled
be in vain.

346
00:51:35,648 --> 00:51:37,408
You've been badly hurt,

347
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,008
and gone through a lot.

348
00:51:40,808 --> 00:51:42,048
Be a leader,

349
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:45,088
and give hope to your people.

350
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:48,648
Look out for your tribe, Aslıhan Hatun.

351
00:51:51,688 --> 00:51:53,448
If something happens to him,

352
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,568
what do we do, Ertuğrul Bey?

353
00:51:58,848 --> 00:52:00,608
All our beys are dead.

354
00:52:01,288 --> 00:52:04,008
Our soldiers are run-down
with all the betrayals.

355
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:08,328
The tribe's been awash with our own blood.

356
00:52:09,968 --> 00:52:13,288
I'll pray to God that he doesn't take
this brave man from us.

357
00:52:18,808 --> 00:52:20,728
And if it did happen...

358
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:23,848
know that...

359
00:52:25,688 --> 00:52:27,848
I, Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah,

360
00:52:28,128 --> 00:52:30,928
will always be on your side,
along with my tribe.

361
00:53:23,048 --> 00:53:24,008
Men!

362
00:53:26,168 --> 00:53:29,008
Enough of this. Why are you all sulking?

363
00:53:30,968 --> 00:53:32,248
Pull yourselves together.

364
00:53:38,808 --> 00:53:40,808
Even the women caring for their husbands

365
00:53:41,008 --> 00:53:44,168
and mothers waiting for their sons
are stronger than you.

366
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:46,488
Snap out of it!

367
00:53:49,448 --> 00:53:52,248
Turgut Commander,
you know how Aliyar Bey is.

368
00:53:53,808 --> 00:53:56,608
We couldn't even
protect Ertuğrul Bey at the inn.

369
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:57,768
God forbid.

370
00:54:02,728 --> 00:54:04,408
What if something happened to our bey?

371
00:54:05,968 --> 00:54:07,608
I feel ashamed as an alp.

372
00:54:16,808 --> 00:54:17,928
My brothers.

373
00:54:18,848 --> 00:54:21,728
We all fought well.

374
00:54:23,808 --> 00:54:25,768
We took down most of them.

375
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,128
That dog Vasilius...

376
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:36,088
turned his tail and ran, right?

377
00:54:36,328 --> 00:54:37,888
Yes, indeed.

378
00:54:38,128 --> 00:54:40,528
He ran away, the bastard.

379
00:54:40,888 --> 00:54:42,848
To hell with him.

380
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:47,328
He ran away with his tail
between his legs like the coward he is.

381
00:54:49,288 --> 00:54:53,528
Do you remember what happened
when we were taking Hafsa Hatun

382
00:54:54,008 --> 00:54:55,168
to her father, the governor?

383
00:54:55,368 --> 00:54:56,448
What happened?

384
00:54:56,768 --> 00:54:59,088
That dog Vasilius ambushed us.

385
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,688
Who came to our help then?

386
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:06,528
<i>Woah!</i>

387
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:09,048
<i>We're being attacked!</i>

388
00:55:09,528 --> 00:55:12,888
<i>-For God!</i>
<i>-For God!</i>

389
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:16,608
<i>For God!</i>

390
00:55:36,768 --> 00:55:37,768
Helena!

391
00:55:55,048 --> 00:55:56,048
Aliyar Bey.

392
00:55:56,368 --> 00:55:59,728
He came like the wind
and saved us all.

393
00:56:00,088 --> 00:56:02,768
And then vanished into thin air.

394
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:06,208
Yeah. He knew what
Ural would do and was prepared.

395
00:56:06,368 --> 00:56:09,168
He risked his life for us.

396
00:56:09,288 --> 00:56:12,528
Who helped Ertuğrul Bey
every single time

397
00:56:12,688 --> 00:56:15,288
that we were in trouble?

398
00:57:04,048 --> 00:57:07,928
Aliyar Bey. He always came as a godsend.

399
00:57:08,688 --> 00:57:11,048
Yes, he did, my brother.

400
00:57:11,368 --> 00:57:12,688
Indeed he did.

401
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,248
With his sword,

402
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:18,568
he always fought bravely
beside Ertuğrul Bey,

403
00:57:19,888 --> 00:57:22,488
as a worthy soldier

404
00:57:22,928 --> 00:57:24,848
of our prophet Ali, right?

405
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:27,128
Yes, he did.

406
00:57:27,408 --> 00:57:28,888
He did, indeed.

407
00:57:29,328 --> 00:57:32,728
But if it wasn't for Ebu Mansur
we'd be in trouble.

408
00:57:33,128 --> 00:57:38,368
Yes, if it weren't for him,
both tribes would be left without a bey.

409
00:57:39,448 --> 00:57:43,408
Right. Then, how could we have explained
it to our bey and Aslıhan Hatun?

410
00:57:44,408 --> 00:57:50,488
However, my brothers,
just as Aliyar Bey reached out for us,

411
00:57:50,608 --> 00:57:54,088
Ebu Mansur came as a godsend, too.

412
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:55,928
Now you are talking, brother.

413
00:57:57,088 --> 00:58:00,488
Ebu Mansur came just in time, thank God!

414
00:58:02,768 --> 00:58:07,728
God did not leave us alone on the path
of Ertuğrul Bey's cause, again.

415
00:58:08,288 --> 00:58:09,288
Right, brother.

416
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:12,448
In the past, it was Aliyar Bey.
And now it was Ebu Mansur.

417
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:17,048
We got one step closer
to his cause, brothers.

418
00:58:18,608 --> 00:58:20,128
With God's permission,

419
00:58:21,848 --> 00:58:24,968
we have nothing to be
ashamed of as alps.

420
00:58:25,888 --> 00:58:27,888
Turgut is right, my men.

421
00:58:28,568 --> 00:58:33,368
From now on,
we can't be upset by such things.

422
00:58:33,888 --> 00:58:38,208
Now what befalls us is to take revenge.

423
00:58:38,368 --> 00:58:40,568
Our revenge will be so brutal

424
00:58:41,088 --> 00:58:44,528
that even the soil will spit back
the blood of those bastards.

425
00:58:44,808 --> 00:58:47,528
They will not find a place
to rest their dead bodies.

426
00:58:48,848 --> 00:58:52,448
The arrow
has already left the bow.

427
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:54,368
Unless we find that dog Vasilius,

428
00:58:54,768 --> 00:58:59,048
and avenge our brother Doğan,
as well as the blood

429
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:02,848
of all the other men we lost,
we can't stop. Understand?

430
00:59:02,968 --> 00:59:07,448
May we never stop until
we take their revenge.

431
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:11,168
Brothers, this will be such a war

432
00:59:11,288 --> 00:59:14,728
that with Ertuğrul Bey on our right,
and Aliyar Bey on our left,

433
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:18,248
we will make the heavens tremble
with the sound of our swords.

434
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,968
This will be such a war that

435
00:59:21,168 --> 00:59:23,448
our dead will rise
from their graves in respect.

436
00:59:23,648 --> 00:59:30,248
Our brother Doğan
will fight alongside us, brothers.

437
00:59:30,408 --> 00:59:32,128
God bless you all!

438
00:59:32,728 --> 00:59:38,248
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

439
00:59:38,488 --> 00:59:42,688
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

440
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:57,048
<i>Ekaterina, it's me.</i>
<i>We must talk.</i>

441
00:59:57,328 --> 00:59:58,448
Come in, Vasilius.

442
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:15,008
Now that you are home,
you look even more dazzling.

443
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:18,688
We age too fast, Vasilius.
Time flies away.

444
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,008
And we are still empty-handed.

445
01:00:21,448 --> 01:00:23,008
That's not true at all.

446
01:00:23,528 --> 01:00:24,608
What happened?

447
01:00:25,408 --> 01:00:26,408
Aliyar.

448
01:00:26,808 --> 01:00:27,808
Is he dead or what?

449
01:00:28,248 --> 01:00:32,448
Maybe not, but he won't live long
with those wounds.

450
01:00:33,168 --> 01:00:35,928
Ertuğrul was supposed to share his fate,

451
01:00:36,528 --> 01:00:40,688
but somebody turned up
and saved him along with his men.

452
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:42,688
Who was it?

453
01:00:45,168 --> 01:00:47,168
It's on you to find out who.

454
01:01:05,648 --> 01:01:06,608
Ural...

455
01:01:08,568 --> 01:01:11,928
said you went to Konya
with him some time ago.

456
01:01:14,928 --> 01:01:17,688
Did you see Sultan Alaeddin then?

457
01:01:19,128 --> 01:01:21,288
What does Sultan Alaeddin have to do
with this?

458
01:01:21,408 --> 01:01:22,968
Did you or did you not?

459
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:26,608
It's true that I went to Konya
with Candar Bey and Ural Bey.

460
01:01:27,248 --> 01:01:28,928
We attended the circumcision feast

461
01:01:29,088 --> 01:01:30,808
of the Sultan's son,
Izzettin Kilij Arslan.

462
01:01:31,048 --> 01:01:32,568
I saw him there once.

463
01:01:45,288 --> 01:01:46,728
We are together...

464
01:01:48,008 --> 01:01:49,768
in this great task,

465
01:01:51,168 --> 01:01:53,208
for our great cause, right, Ekaterina?

466
01:02:00,608 --> 01:02:02,728
There's something I need you to do.

467
01:02:03,328 --> 01:02:04,848
You must go to the Public Market.

468
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:10,288
Disguise yourself and notice
who comes and goes.

469
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:14,568
You must find someone called Ebu Mansur.

470
01:02:14,928 --> 01:02:19,048
See if that Ebu Mansur is
Sultan Alaeddin.

471
01:02:19,888 --> 01:02:20,808
Is he here?

472
01:02:21,048 --> 01:02:23,448
I hope he is, Ekaterina.

473
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:27,648
If so, we'll get rid of
a lot of our troubles.

474
01:02:30,488 --> 01:02:33,168
Only you can do this job.

475
01:02:33,688 --> 01:02:36,408
And I presume
it won't prove too hard for you.

476
01:02:36,728 --> 01:02:38,768
Leave it to me, Vasilius.

477
01:02:39,368 --> 01:02:41,648
I'll do anything for revenge.

478
01:02:42,168 --> 01:02:43,248
Anything at all.

479
01:02:47,008 --> 01:02:49,128
That's what I'm afraid of, Ekaterina.

480
01:02:51,248 --> 01:02:53,848
Don't be like me.
Control your anger.

481
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:13,408
You have yet to see
your worst fears, Vasilius.

482
01:03:13,928 --> 01:03:15,688
And your worst nightmare.

483
01:03:47,048 --> 01:03:48,128
I'm done for.

484
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:50,808
I'm done for, Hafsa Hatun.

485
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,128
Your wound isn't too deep, Bamsi.

486
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:57,408
But maybe you should have
Artuk Bey check it.

487
01:03:57,608 --> 01:04:00,208
No, I don't mean that, Hafsa Hatun.

488
01:04:01,248 --> 01:04:03,968
It's the treacherous enemy
that disturbs me,

489
01:04:04,848 --> 01:04:06,888
not this small wound.

490
01:04:09,128 --> 01:04:10,128
I wish

491
01:04:10,528 --> 01:04:16,168
that disgusting Vasilius
had hurt me and not Aliyar Bey.

492
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:23,688
God willing, Aliyar Bey
will return to his tribe safe and sound.

493
01:04:26,288 --> 01:04:30,608
God will not let Vasilius go unpunished,
with all that he's done.

494
01:04:33,368 --> 01:04:37,728
You will take revenge for all of us,
with Ertuğrul Bey.

495
01:04:39,808 --> 01:04:42,968
I hope so, Hafsa Hatun.

496
01:04:45,568 --> 01:04:49,568
Bamsi, you are the hope
of all those oppressed in this land.

497
01:04:50,848 --> 01:04:53,568
My people will be on our side, too.

498
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:55,808
However,

499
01:04:56,008 --> 01:05:01,048
we must first take
that dog's head, just like Ural.

500
01:05:01,928 --> 01:05:04,688
Sooner or later,
he will pay for what he did.

501
01:05:04,928 --> 01:05:05,888
May God

502
01:05:06,048 --> 01:05:09,888
let me live till the day
I see him get what he deserves.

503
01:05:10,968 --> 01:05:12,088
Hafsa Hatun.

504
01:05:16,808 --> 01:05:18,128
Amen, my love.

505
01:05:25,757 --> 01:05:30,757
I can see the anger in your eyes just
as I can feel your pain, Ertuğrul Bey.

506
01:05:32,517 --> 01:05:36,677
Vasilius used Ural to stain
the Cavdar tribe with blood.

507
01:05:37,797 --> 01:05:40,637
He lured many of the Turk tribes'
bravest warriors to his cause.

508
01:05:42,517 --> 01:05:43,717
And now, Aliyar...

509
01:05:44,957 --> 01:05:46,957
He must be avenged, my sultan.

510
01:05:48,677 --> 01:05:52,917
Taking Vasilius' head
or Karacahisar Castle

511
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,797
would not prove difficult for our army.

512
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:57,077
But if I take the castle,

513
01:05:57,717 --> 01:06:00,837
both the Crusaders
and the emperor will get involved.

514
01:06:03,197 --> 01:06:05,037
As I have understood,
from my discussions

515
01:06:05,237 --> 01:06:08,037
with the people when I was going
by the name of Ebu Mansur,

516
01:06:08,517 --> 01:06:12,957
you've managed to conquer the hearts
of both Muslims and non-Muslims alike.

517
01:06:13,717 --> 01:06:16,997
I have upheld the duty bestowed
upon us by God, my Sultan.

518
01:06:17,957 --> 01:06:21,557
I have carried out
your orders for our state.

519
01:06:24,317 --> 01:06:28,397
I know you want to secure
the western border, my sultan.

520
01:06:30,157 --> 01:06:34,037
When you have gone to war,
we will carry out your orders

521
01:06:35,237 --> 01:06:37,437
and keep this area secure.

522
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:42,037
Speak frankly, Ertuğrul Bey.

523
01:06:43,877 --> 01:06:46,077
We're capable of taking Karacahisar Castle

524
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:50,517
and sending Vasilius' head to the emperor.

525
01:06:51,917 --> 01:06:54,957
You need only believe in
the unity of the Turkish beys

526
01:06:55,957 --> 01:06:58,677
as you believe in me.

527
01:06:59,117 --> 01:07:02,077
You're telling me you can take
Karacahisar without an army?

528
01:07:03,077 --> 01:07:04,997
Not only can we take it, my sultan,

529
01:07:05,477 --> 01:07:09,277
we can keep the land surrounding
it secure afterwards too.

530
01:07:12,717 --> 01:07:15,317
I know the weaknesses
of the emperor in Nicaea.

531
01:07:16,557 --> 01:07:18,997
I'm also aware of the greed
of the Latins in Constantinople.

532
01:07:20,557 --> 01:07:23,917
Do you think you can manage to keep
the peace with only your alps?

533
01:07:24,517 --> 01:07:28,277
We've been training our alps
like an army for some time now.

534
01:07:29,317 --> 01:07:32,677
I have my best alps training them.

535
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:35,797
Not a day goes by without them training.

536
01:07:37,037 --> 01:07:42,397
The emperor has sent his best men
to drive us from these lands.

537
01:07:43,237 --> 01:07:45,797
You managed to kill them all
and enter the castle.

538
01:07:46,397 --> 01:07:49,237
You rescued your brother Dündar
from the hands of Vasilius.

539
01:07:50,917 --> 01:07:55,117
More have been sent, elite soldiers.

540
01:07:56,437 --> 01:07:58,117
Their intention is obvious, my sultan.

541
01:07:58,877 --> 01:08:01,317
But I am still convinced

542
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:05,557
I can take Karacahisar Castle.

543
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:52,917
My brave warrior...

544
01:08:59,597 --> 01:09:01,637
He won't be long now.

545
01:09:02,837 --> 01:09:05,557
When he comes with that
beautiful face...

546
01:09:07,997 --> 01:09:09,917
I'll see you once again.

547
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,637
May I come in?

548
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:29,797
Of course, Mother.

549
01:09:36,237 --> 01:09:39,237
No, no, sit down. Sit down.

550
01:09:42,037 --> 01:09:44,877
I wanted to see you before I went to bed.
How are you?

551
01:09:45,317 --> 01:09:48,037
I'm fine, thank you, Mother.

552
01:09:49,597 --> 01:09:52,437
Halime Sultan has had her baby.

553
01:09:53,317 --> 01:09:54,997
I have everything I need.

554
01:09:55,397 --> 01:09:56,637
At last.

555
01:09:56,797 --> 01:10:00,237
Soon you too will have your baby
in your arms, God willing.

556
01:10:00,557 --> 01:10:05,477
Doğan's child will run around and play
with my own grandchildren one day.

557
01:10:06,197 --> 01:10:09,237
He'll ride horses
and wield swords, God willing.

558
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:11,237
God willing, Mother.

559
01:10:12,357 --> 01:10:17,397
They will be alps worthy of their fathers,
and of their ancestors.

560
01:10:18,277 --> 01:10:19,397
God willing.

561
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:23,077
I hope he'll be born soon.

562
01:10:24,597 --> 01:10:30,437
I want to entrust Doğan's
child to you and Ertuğrul Bey.

563
01:10:32,117 --> 01:10:33,877
What do you mean by that, Banu Çiçek?

564
01:10:34,837 --> 01:10:39,317
We set out to claim these lands
for our children, Mother Hayme.

565
01:10:40,477 --> 01:10:45,357
We lost so many along the way.
Doğan was martyred close to Ertuğrul Bey.

566
01:10:46,317 --> 01:10:47,957
Aliyar Bey fights for his life.

567
01:10:48,317 --> 01:10:53,917
Those who are holding swords
will consider martyrdom in this fight.

568
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:59,317
The motherland awaits us.
Man or woman, it doesn't matter.

569
01:11:02,357 --> 01:11:06,117
-Daughter, now you--
-My child is for you,

570
01:11:07,117 --> 01:11:08,597
my life is for God,

571
01:11:08,717 --> 01:11:11,237
and my sword is for Ertuğrul Bey
to look after, Mother.

572
01:11:14,877 --> 01:11:16,957
I don't want other mothers to cry,

573
01:11:17,517 --> 01:11:20,757
so until Karacahisar Castle
comes down on Vasilius

574
01:11:22,837 --> 01:11:24,997
I won't so much as smell my child.

575
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,157
Look, dear...

576
01:11:32,557 --> 01:11:36,077
Doğan left you in our care.

577
01:11:36,797 --> 01:11:38,637
Doğan was my son.

578
01:11:39,477 --> 01:11:41,117
And you're my daughter.

579
01:11:41,477 --> 01:11:44,117
I think of you and Halime the same way.

580
01:11:47,397 --> 01:11:51,677
Ertuğrul will make Vasilius pay,
one way or another.

581
01:11:52,477 --> 01:11:55,477
But your duty...

582
01:11:57,597 --> 01:11:59,637
is to look after your child.

583
01:12:03,637 --> 01:12:04,917
My mother.

584
01:12:23,117 --> 01:12:24,237
Brother.

585
01:12:26,757 --> 01:12:28,877
You were away from us for so long.

586
01:12:31,957 --> 01:12:33,997
Even when you came home you couldn't rest.

587
01:12:37,197 --> 01:12:39,797
You protected me after Father died.

588
01:12:42,117 --> 01:12:45,357
If you go too, I won't have anybody.

589
01:12:50,837 --> 01:12:52,277
Please don't leave me.

590
01:13:05,477 --> 01:13:07,797
Artuk Bey, his hand moved!

591
01:13:10,237 --> 01:13:12,517
God the healer! God the healer!

592
01:13:16,837 --> 01:13:19,277
Aliyar Bey, can you hear me?

593
01:13:37,517 --> 01:13:38,557
Sister.

594
01:13:39,797 --> 01:13:40,837
Brother!

595
01:13:47,397 --> 01:13:49,117
Call Ertuğrul Bey for me.

596
01:13:50,397 --> 01:13:53,437
-Ishak, get Ertuğrul Bey here, quickly.
-Right away.

597
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:03,517
At last. Praise God.

598
01:14:09,317 --> 01:14:12,397
Vasilius has spent a lot of time
fortifying the castle walls.

599
01:14:12,997 --> 01:14:14,237
He's preparing it for war.

600
01:14:14,837 --> 01:14:20,717
But all he's done is wall himself in
with the anger he feels for me.

601
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:26,717
Any reputation he had among his own
people has been tarnished and lost.

602
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:34,357
With patience and cunning,
I can take the head of Vasilius,

603
01:14:34,717 --> 01:14:36,957
trapped as he is
by his own rage and folly.

604
01:14:38,117 --> 01:14:43,797
I'll raise our glorious flag
above the walls of Karacahisar Castle.

605
01:14:45,317 --> 01:14:49,797
You can leave with your army
and with your mind at ease, my sultan.

606
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:52,157
May I enter?

607
01:14:54,437 --> 01:14:55,437
Go on.

608
01:15:01,037 --> 01:15:03,557
Ertuğrul Bey, do we have
your permission to enter?

609
01:15:05,597 --> 01:15:06,597
Come in, Mother.

610
01:15:12,637 --> 01:15:16,597
We wanted to show
our gratitude to Ebu Mansur.

611
01:15:16,997 --> 01:15:19,957
I am humbled.
We were just passing by.

612
01:15:21,677 --> 01:15:25,637
You saved our men. God bless you.

613
01:15:27,117 --> 01:15:30,437
Thank you. What are their names?

614
01:15:40,037 --> 01:15:41,477
My eldest son is Gündüz.

615
01:15:49,557 --> 01:15:51,037
We haven't named the baby yet.

616
01:15:52,197 --> 01:15:55,517
My father, Suleyman Shah,
wanted him to be called Savci.

617
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,397
But I'd like you to name him.

618
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:03,637
I would be honored.

619
01:16:18,797 --> 01:16:21,797
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. <i>Allahu akbar</i>.

620
01:16:23,117 --> 01:16:26,037
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. <i>Allahu akbar.</i>

621
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:29,037
There is no god but God.

622
01:16:29,517 --> 01:16:31,477
There is no god but God.

623
01:16:32,317 --> 01:16:34,437
Muhammad is the Messenger of God.

624
01:16:35,317 --> 01:16:37,477
Muhammad is the Messenger of God.

625
01:16:38,397 --> 01:16:41,357
Hasten to the prayer.
Hasten to the prayer.

626
01:16:43,317 --> 01:16:46,357
Hasten to the salvation.
Hasten to the salvation.

627
01:16:47,557 --> 01:16:49,837
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. <i>Allahu akbar</i>.

628
01:16:50,797 --> 01:16:52,237
God is the only god.

629
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:57,957
Your name is Savci.

630
01:16:59,277 --> 01:17:00,797
Your name is Savci.

631
01:17:02,077 --> 01:17:03,797
Your name is Savci.

632
01:17:10,117 --> 01:17:15,637
Your ancestor Suleyman Shah gave you
your name. God grant you a long life.

633
01:17:16,677 --> 01:17:17,997
-Amen.
-Amen.

634
01:17:18,597 --> 01:17:19,597
Amen.

635
01:17:20,797 --> 01:17:22,637
May the angels above...

636
01:17:24,117 --> 01:17:26,877
and the servants below
know that from now on...

637
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:29,957
your name is Savci.

638
01:17:40,517 --> 01:17:43,637
-May I enter, my bey?
-Come in, Ishak.

639
01:17:46,677 --> 01:17:49,117
-<i>Salaam-Alaikum.</i>
-<i>Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

640
01:17:49,597 --> 01:17:52,477
My bey, Aliyar Bey is awake.
He wants to see you.

641
01:17:54,517 --> 01:17:55,477
At last!

642
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:57,717
At last.

643
01:18:22,957 --> 01:18:24,237
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

644
01:18:29,597 --> 01:18:30,837
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

645
01:18:32,717 --> 01:18:33,957
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

646
01:18:37,037 --> 01:18:38,357
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

647
01:18:57,277 --> 01:18:59,517
Peace of God be upon you.

648
01:19:03,877 --> 01:19:06,277
Peace of God be upon you.

649
01:19:11,357 --> 01:19:17,197
I lived as a traveler in this world.

650
01:19:19,117 --> 01:19:24,637
Thank God that my fate was to...

651
01:19:26,517 --> 01:19:31,277
be martyred fighting for his cause.

652
01:19:31,677 --> 01:19:32,677
Brother!

653
01:19:39,397 --> 01:19:40,397
Brother...

654
01:19:45,877 --> 01:19:47,157
Ertuğrul Bey...

655
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:02,037
Aliyar Bey?

656
01:20:03,037 --> 01:20:04,197
Ertuğrul Bey.

657
01:20:07,277 --> 01:20:08,597
Come closer.

658
01:20:12,077 --> 01:20:15,237
Let me see you one last time.

659
01:20:18,197 --> 01:20:19,677
There's something I must say.

660
01:20:20,077 --> 01:20:21,877
Don't waste your energy, Aliyar Bey.

661
01:20:23,557 --> 01:20:26,237
It's time to leave this life...

662
01:20:28,637 --> 01:20:30,797
behind, Ertuğrul Bey.

663
01:20:36,317 --> 01:20:37,677
My sister and my tribe...

664
01:20:43,237 --> 01:20:45,157
are yours to look after.

665
01:20:49,197 --> 01:20:50,797
You have to take Karacahisar...

666
01:20:53,717 --> 01:20:56,677
and avenge our...

667
01:20:59,517 --> 01:21:00,997
fallen warriors.

668
01:21:05,877 --> 01:21:06,917
Ertuğrul Bey...

669
01:21:12,837 --> 01:21:14,757
Give me your blessing.

670
01:21:15,597 --> 01:21:16,557
Aliyar Bey...

671
01:21:19,197 --> 01:21:23,117
I'm so glad to have been able to fight
by the side of a warrior like you.

672
01:21:25,277 --> 01:21:29,557
I'll continue down our path,
never resting.

673
01:21:32,837 --> 01:21:36,917
Both your will and your requests
are written on my heart.

674
01:21:41,237 --> 01:21:42,957
But don't give up.

675
01:21:45,397 --> 01:21:47,557
Don't leave me alone on this journey.

676
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:53,197
You'll be all right.

677
01:21:58,317 --> 01:21:59,917
Brother! Brother!

678
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:03,637
Artuk Bey! Artuk Bey, help him!

679
01:22:04,397 --> 01:22:06,077
Brother, no!

680
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:22,477
There is no god but God...

681
01:22:27,397 --> 01:22:29,637
and Muhammad is the Messenger...

682
01:22:32,317 --> 01:22:34,237
and the servant of God.

683
01:22:34,797 --> 01:22:36,477
Oh God.

684
01:22:42,437 --> 01:22:44,957
No! Brother, please!

685
01:22:47,597 --> 01:22:49,517
No! No!

686
01:22:51,797 --> 01:22:52,917
No!

687
01:25:48,997 --> 01:25:54,197
We have delivered to your peace
our warriors who died

688
01:25:54,677 --> 01:26:00,117
for our faith and country.
Give them peace, God.

689
01:26:02,197 --> 01:26:04,917
Grant your people patience, God.

690
01:26:05,517 --> 01:26:09,197
Heal our wounded quickly, God.

691
01:26:09,917 --> 01:26:14,797
Deliver us from all kinds of enemies,
within or beyond,

692
01:26:15,317 --> 01:26:21,797
who would disturb our faith,
state and nation.

693
01:26:24,877 --> 01:26:28,197
Grant victory to our noble resistance

694
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:34,517
as it fights for justice
and righteousness, God.

695
01:26:36,117 --> 01:26:40,197
For the sake of our martyrs

696
01:26:40,637 --> 01:26:42,757
please accept our prayers.

697
01:26:43,477 --> 01:26:47,517
Grant them safe passage to heaven, God.

698
01:26:50,717 --> 01:26:52,437
You grant justice.

699
01:26:54,477 --> 01:26:56,557
You are the all-powerful.

700
01:26:58,037 --> 01:27:00,077
Amen. Amen.

701
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:07,717
<i>Ve selamun alel murselin</i>
<i>velhamdulillahi rabbil alemin.</i>

702
01:27:08,397 --> 01:27:09,597
<i>Al Fatiha.</i>

703
01:27:36,397 --> 01:27:37,637
<i>Salaam-Alaikum</i>, sir.

704
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:40,117
<i>Alaikum-Salaam</i>.

705
01:27:42,197 --> 01:27:43,877
Ertuğrul Bey awaits you.

706
01:27:46,757 --> 01:27:47,957
Let's go, Abdurrahman.

707
01:27:50,117 --> 01:27:53,037
Let us carry out our last
duty to our martyrs.

708
01:28:08,437 --> 01:28:09,437
Mother.

709
01:28:12,117 --> 01:28:13,157
I'll come too.

710
01:28:13,557 --> 01:28:16,437
-Daughter.
-I must be there for Aslıhan.

711
01:28:26,597 --> 01:28:27,717
Brother.

712
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:37,237
You were my life.

713
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,037
You were more than my life.

714
01:28:48,717 --> 01:28:50,917
My brave brother.

715
01:30:08,317 --> 01:30:10,357
Avenge my brother, Ertuğrul Bey.

716
01:30:14,477 --> 01:30:18,037
The alps of my tribe
are at your command.

717
01:30:19,877 --> 01:30:21,197
As am I.

718
01:30:23,237 --> 01:30:28,637
I swear that I will drown Vasilius
in the blood of our martyrs.

719
01:30:34,717 --> 01:30:36,957
Look after the Cavdar tribe,
Aslıhan Hatun.

720
01:30:38,397 --> 01:30:39,677
Stay strong.

721
01:30:42,397 --> 01:30:48,317
Stay strong so that the people
and the alps can share in your strength.

722
01:30:53,477 --> 01:30:54,477
Now...

723
01:30:57,957 --> 01:31:02,997
it's time to unite to carry out
Aliyar Bey's final wishes.

724
01:31:18,957 --> 01:31:20,077
Brother.

725
01:32:36,837 --> 01:32:37,917
Aliyar Bey...

726
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:41,677
is with God, my sultan.

727
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:49,357
May he rest in peace.

728
01:32:50,597 --> 01:32:51,597
Amen.

729
01:32:53,397 --> 01:32:57,157
You didn't hesitate to risk
your lives for my state.

730
01:32:58,717 --> 01:33:00,357
You lost many.

731
01:33:01,157 --> 01:33:04,477
Aliyar Bey has also
been martyred for my state.

732
01:33:05,277 --> 01:33:09,437
I must avenge him, Ertuğrul Bey.

733
01:33:11,917 --> 01:33:17,517
The emperor is the snake
and Vasilius is its venom.

734
01:33:19,517 --> 01:33:21,797
The head of the snake must be cut off.

735
01:33:23,717 --> 01:33:27,117
We would gladly sacrifice our lives
for our state, my sultan.

736
01:33:28,797 --> 01:33:31,637
Your words and what I have seen of you,

737
01:33:32,117 --> 01:33:34,717
what I know of your deeds in these lands,

738
01:33:35,237 --> 01:33:37,117
have already convinced me, Ertuğrul Bey.

739
01:33:39,117 --> 01:33:41,757
You succeeded in uniting
the Turk tribes.

740
01:33:42,597 --> 01:33:45,997
This united force must
now take Karacahisar.

741
01:33:51,837 --> 01:33:54,517
Call a council before I return to Konya.

742
01:33:54,997 --> 01:34:00,037
I want to see the beys myself
so that I may declare you their leader.

743
01:34:05,717 --> 01:34:08,237
I know that you will avenge our martyrs.

744
01:34:12,357 --> 01:34:16,837
When Karacahisar is conquered,
I will grant you these lands.

745
01:34:18,717 --> 01:34:22,317
The territory of the glorious Kayi
will be a land of justice

746
01:34:22,677 --> 01:34:25,557
for Turk tribes and non-Muslims alike.

747
01:34:26,797 --> 01:34:30,157
May God not give you shame
in this endeavor.

748
01:34:32,157 --> 01:34:33,157
Amen.

749
01:34:36,997 --> 01:34:41,157
The Quran will be our guide,
Alaeddin Keykubat Khan, our sultan,

750
01:34:41,757 --> 01:34:47,117
and Oghuz Han, our ancestor.
May Allah help and protect us.

751
01:34:48,597 --> 01:34:52,357
Our lives are lived for your state.

752
01:34:55,317 --> 01:35:00,357
May God not give us shame
before our martyrs.

753
01:35:09,117 --> 01:35:12,517
Ertuğrul , Aliyar, Aslıhan.

754
01:35:13,237 --> 01:35:15,637
Let me see the day they all die, God.

755
01:35:16,077 --> 01:35:19,837
Let me accomplish my final duty
in this castle in which I'm entombed.

756
01:35:20,557 --> 01:35:22,997
Let me kill that dog, Vasilius.

757
01:35:23,477 --> 01:35:26,037
May my hands be covered
with his dirty blood.

758
01:35:26,437 --> 01:35:29,757
After that, even hell will be
heaven for me.

759
01:37:04,717 --> 01:37:07,397
-<i>Salaam-Alaikum</i>.
-<i>Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

760
01:37:07,557 --> 01:37:08,677
<i>Alaikum-Salaam</i>.

761
01:37:24,477 --> 01:37:26,797
<i>Al Fatiha</i>, for the soul of our martyr.

762
01:37:56,757 --> 01:37:58,957
I seek refuge in God from
the cursed Satan.

763
01:37:59,197 --> 01:38:00,717
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

764
01:38:01,477 --> 01:38:04,437
Our prophet says that

765
01:38:04,637 --> 01:38:08,717
seeing the angel of death is worse than
being pierced by a thousand swords.

766
01:38:10,877 --> 01:38:13,077
But there is no death for believers.

767
01:38:14,077 --> 01:38:17,957
Death is merely a migration for them.

768
01:38:18,957 --> 01:38:25,277
And when a believer is martyred
he will not be questioned.

769
01:38:32,317 --> 01:38:34,997
We all knew Aliyar Bey when he was alive.

770
01:38:35,717 --> 01:38:39,477
We are all witness to the fact that
he was a good Muslim and a fair Bey.

771
01:38:40,677 --> 01:38:42,557
May God grant us martyrdom,

772
01:38:43,077 --> 01:38:46,837
may he allow us to
give our lives for him.

773
01:38:46,997 --> 01:38:47,957
Amen.

774
01:38:48,317 --> 01:38:49,637
-Amen.
-Amen.

775
01:38:50,717 --> 01:38:54,197
If a land is to be a motherland,
it needs sacrifice.

776
01:38:55,717 --> 01:39:00,157
Our sacrifice is the blood
of our many martyrs.

777
01:39:01,757 --> 01:39:06,517
God, do not let the descendants
of the martyrs who settled here

778
01:39:06,837 --> 01:39:08,437
leave your path.

779
01:39:08,557 --> 01:39:10,397
-Amen.
-Amen.

780
01:39:10,957 --> 01:39:12,197
-Amen.
-Amen.

781
01:39:12,397 --> 01:39:13,317
Amen.

782
01:39:15,237 --> 01:39:20,877
Make our descendants responsible,
and make them good Muslims.

783
01:39:21,397 --> 01:39:22,237
Amen.

784
01:39:22,677 --> 01:39:24,157
-Amen.
-Amen.

785
01:39:54,797 --> 01:39:56,277
I'm ready to go.

786
01:40:17,477 --> 01:40:21,157
You were wasted on the Turks, Ekaterina.

787
01:40:22,557 --> 01:40:24,997
I'll be whoever I want to be.

788
01:40:25,837 --> 01:40:27,317
I'm doing what's necessary.

789
01:40:28,037 --> 01:40:29,317
You're doing even more.

790
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:32,477
You're going to find out
who Ebu Mansur is.

791
01:40:32,837 --> 01:40:34,077
And if he's Alaeddin?

792
01:40:34,637 --> 01:40:38,117
Then we'll have a treasure.

793
01:40:42,597 --> 01:40:44,117
-Sir.
-Speak.

794
01:40:44,557 --> 01:40:46,117
I have news that you should hear.

795
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:47,917
Speak!

796
01:40:48,677 --> 01:40:53,357
Our scouts say a convoy left
the Kayi tribe for the Cavdar tribe.

797
01:40:53,477 --> 01:40:55,437
They're transporting a coffin on a cart.

798
01:41:05,117 --> 01:41:07,237
I told you he wouldn't live long.

799
01:41:08,517 --> 01:41:10,917
May you suffer, Aliyar.

800
01:41:11,797 --> 01:41:15,877
This is only a fraction of the pain
we're going to make them feel, Ekaterina.

801
01:41:15,997 --> 01:41:17,117
A fraction.

802
01:41:17,917 --> 01:41:21,677
I won't stop until there's nobody
left to mourn them.

803
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:28,757
That cart will not stay empty.
One will die before another is mourned.

804
01:41:29,557 --> 01:41:33,357
-You're so--
-So angry, Vasilius.

805
01:41:34,157 --> 01:41:37,757
I refuse to show mercy
to anyone who has hurt me.

806
01:41:48,597 --> 01:41:50,397
Get on with it, then.

807
01:42:00,837 --> 01:42:05,917
<i>Allahu akbar</i>.
There is no god but God.

808
01:42:06,157 --> 01:42:10,917
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

809
01:42:11,397 --> 01:42:15,957
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

810
01:42:16,197 --> 01:42:20,677
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

811
01:42:21,197 --> 01:42:25,717
<i>Allahu akbar.</i> There is no god but God.

812
01:42:26,037 --> 01:42:31,037
<i>Allahu akbar.</i> There is no god but God.

813
01:42:31,357 --> 01:42:36,037
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

814
01:42:36,437 --> 01:42:41,237
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

815
01:42:41,637 --> 01:42:46,157
<i>Allahu akbar.</i> There is no god but God.

816
01:42:46,917 --> 01:42:51,517
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

817
01:42:51,757 --> 01:42:56,597
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

818
01:42:56,877 --> 01:43:01,677
<i>Allahu akbar.</i> There is no god but God.

819
01:43:01,877 --> 01:43:06,477
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

820
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:38,437
Welcome, emir.

821
01:44:39,877 --> 01:44:41,237
Where is Ertuğrul Bey?

822
01:44:41,997 --> 01:44:43,357
Aliyar Bey has died.

823
01:44:44,477 --> 01:44:46,317
They went to the Cavdar tribe to bury him.

824
01:44:50,317 --> 01:44:51,677
{\an8}We're going to the Cavdar tribe.

825
01:44:57,303 --> 01:45:02,423
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

826
01:45:02,743 --> 01:45:07,543
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

827
01:45:07,663 --> 01:45:12,663
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

828
01:45:27,943 --> 01:45:32,823
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

829
01:45:43,263 --> 01:45:48,103
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

830
01:45:58,583 --> 01:46:03,543
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

831
01:46:04,503 --> 01:46:06,343
May you rest in heaven.

832
01:46:06,423 --> 01:46:10,303
-We won't forget him.
-Rest in peace.

833
01:46:14,783 --> 01:46:17,303
Rest in peace, Aliyar Bey,
rest in peace, Aliyar Bey.

834
01:46:17,423 --> 01:46:19,023
God bless you.

835
01:46:40,481 --> 01:46:44,601
Honorable men, women and warriors

836
01:46:46,001 --> 01:46:48,561
of the Cavdar tribe.

837
01:46:51,521 --> 01:46:52,601
Aliyar Bey

838
01:46:54,161 --> 01:46:57,881
led his life honorably,

839
01:46:59,641 --> 01:47:03,161
for his faith, integrity and tribe.

840
01:47:03,961 --> 01:47:06,521
He did not hesitate to give his life...

841
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:10,441
as a brave warrior should.

842
01:47:14,601 --> 01:47:18,121
He has left behind much wisdom

843
01:47:19,121 --> 01:47:23,761
which will illuminate your path.

844
01:47:27,561 --> 01:47:29,201
It is yours now.

845
01:47:32,481 --> 01:47:33,761
Do not forget him.

846
01:47:35,241 --> 01:47:39,001
It's up to you to keep his memory alive.

847
01:47:40,521 --> 01:47:41,521
Remember him.

848
01:47:45,961 --> 01:47:47,281
Do not tarnish his memory.

849
01:48:05,241 --> 01:48:08,801
He was your Bey and my brother.

850
01:48:10,601 --> 01:48:13,601
A mother, a father.

851
01:48:15,161 --> 01:48:19,401
He was a great man who would
shoulder any burden asked of him.

852
01:48:22,761 --> 01:48:25,361
My brother has done
his work in this world.

853
01:48:27,161 --> 01:48:29,041
And he now rests in peace.

854
01:48:32,521 --> 01:48:35,081
It is our duty to continue that work.

855
01:48:36,521 --> 01:48:37,961
We will stand tall.

856
01:48:39,001 --> 01:48:44,921
We will protect our tribe, our honor
and our traditions as he would have done.

857
01:48:46,401 --> 01:48:51,881
Our mourning will be short
but our pain will never fade.

858
01:48:56,121 --> 01:49:00,521
Let it be known that our tribe
will not remain leaderless.

859
01:49:01,401 --> 01:49:07,801
Until a new Bey is elected,
I will uphold my brother's legacy.

860
01:49:30,801 --> 01:49:33,801
We came from God
and we will return to him.

861
01:50:26,681 --> 01:50:27,641
Yes?

862
01:50:29,841 --> 01:50:33,521
Sir, Ekaterina managed
to get a message to our soldiers.

863
01:50:35,001 --> 01:50:36,401
Tell me.

864
01:50:36,761 --> 01:50:40,641
Emir Sadettin was at Hanli bazaar.
But he left quickly.

865
01:50:42,641 --> 01:50:44,121
Emir Sadettin?

866
01:50:48,481 --> 01:50:51,801
So you came, Emir Sadettin.

867
01:50:52,601 --> 01:50:54,881
We're not quite done with you yet.

868
01:50:57,321 --> 01:51:00,401
They've made their intentions
obvious by coming one by one.

869
01:51:01,761 --> 01:51:02,721
War.

870
01:51:05,201 --> 01:51:07,761
I'll give you a most bloody war.

871
01:52:24,681 --> 01:52:25,841
My condolences.

872
01:52:26,281 --> 01:52:28,081
-Thank you, Emir.
-Thank you, Emir.

873
01:52:28,161 --> 01:52:29,401
My condolences.

874
01:52:33,961 --> 01:52:35,561
God bless you, Emir.

875
01:53:21,881 --> 01:53:24,641
I seek refuge in God
from the cursed Satan.

876
01:53:26,921 --> 01:53:28,721
In the name of God.

877
01:53:30,081 --> 01:53:31,481
To the prayers for God.

878
01:53:32,241 --> 01:53:34,201
To witness his Messenger.

879
01:53:35,001 --> 01:53:38,481
To pray for the deceased.

880
01:53:40,401 --> 01:53:41,721
God is great.

881
01:53:54,401 --> 01:53:55,961
God is great.

882
01:54:08,641 --> 01:54:10,001
God is great.

883
01:54:23,081 --> 01:54:24,521
God is great.

884
01:54:25,921 --> 01:54:28,401
Peace of God be upon you.

885
01:54:29,241 --> 01:54:32,001
Peace of God be upon you.

886
01:54:40,081 --> 01:54:42,921
Did you give your blessings to Aliyar Bey?

887
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:44,881
Bless him!

888
01:54:47,561 --> 01:54:48,521
Did you?

889
01:54:48,961 --> 01:54:50,201
Bless him!

890
01:54:50,841 --> 01:54:51,801
Did you?

891
01:54:52,241 --> 01:54:53,481
Bless him!

892
01:54:55,481 --> 01:54:58,521
-And God bless you.
-Amen.

893
01:56:40,361 --> 01:56:42,241
Mother, where is my brother?

894
01:56:42,561 --> 01:56:45,001
He's asleep, Gunduz, be quiet.

895
01:56:53,201 --> 01:56:55,041
The baby looks nothing like me.

896
01:56:56,241 --> 01:56:58,001
Dear boy, come here.

897
01:56:59,801 --> 01:57:04,121
You looked like that too when you
were a baby. Then you grew up.

898
01:57:04,321 --> 01:57:08,881
You became a big brother.
He's only a baby right now.

899
01:57:09,881 --> 01:57:12,921
You've to look after
your brother from now on.

900
01:57:13,081 --> 01:57:17,161
I'm training the alps,
I can't look after him.

901
01:57:18,281 --> 01:57:22,761
You're right, I know.
And you're training them really well.

902
01:57:23,561 --> 01:57:25,961
Put your brother among the alps too,

903
01:57:26,241 --> 01:57:29,201
so that you can both serve
in the ranks of your father.

904
01:57:29,601 --> 01:57:31,761
As long as he swears fealty to me.

905
01:57:33,361 --> 01:57:36,361
Come here. My little bey.

906
01:57:39,401 --> 01:57:41,001
Son of the bey of the beys.

907
01:58:08,041 --> 01:58:09,321
Uncle Alaeddin?

908
01:58:31,241 --> 01:58:32,281
Halime Hatun?

909
01:58:33,601 --> 01:58:37,521
Are you well?
You were far away, what happened?

910
01:58:37,601 --> 01:58:39,001
No, I'm fine.

911
01:58:40,241 --> 01:58:41,721
I just remembered something.

912
01:58:44,161 --> 01:58:45,201
You're tired.

913
01:58:46,001 --> 01:58:48,001
Go and rest. I'll look after the baby.

914
01:58:49,361 --> 01:58:52,521
Thank you, Hafsa.
But I'm fine, don't worry.

915
01:59:30,561 --> 01:59:32,121
He loved to learn.

916
01:59:34,081 --> 01:59:36,841
He didn't see mother or father.

917
01:59:41,921 --> 01:59:45,401
Only knowledge. Only school.

918
01:59:48,041 --> 01:59:49,961
He spent most of his life far away.

919
01:59:52,281 --> 01:59:54,361
When he came back home,

920
01:59:56,081 --> 01:59:59,641
he left this world quickly.

921
02:00:05,041 --> 02:00:11,321
Daughter, we all came from God
and we'll all return to him.

922
02:00:13,401 --> 02:00:18,361
Aliyar Bey went straight to heaven,
according to Islamic ethics.

923
02:00:19,201 --> 02:00:20,841
No doubt about that, Mother Hayme.

924
02:00:24,281 --> 02:00:28,601
I'll walk in his footsteps from now on.

925
02:00:30,081 --> 02:00:32,241
I'll look after his legacy.

926
02:00:33,281 --> 02:00:35,841
I'll stand tall at the head of my tribe.

927
02:00:37,801 --> 02:00:43,161
His friends are my friends,
his enemies are my enemies.

928
02:00:45,041 --> 02:00:46,961
That's my daughter.

929
02:00:49,201 --> 02:00:50,921
We'll always support you.

930
02:00:52,201 --> 02:00:55,201
Ertugrul is your brother too, from now on.

931
02:00:57,281 --> 02:00:59,761
And Halime your sister.

932
02:01:02,641 --> 02:01:04,161
If you agree...

933
02:01:06,601 --> 02:01:08,681
please think of me
as your mother, daughter.

934
02:01:12,921 --> 02:01:16,241
My sweet daughter. My sweet daughter.

935
02:01:18,121 --> 02:01:19,881
God bless you.

936
02:01:22,961 --> 02:01:24,521
Don't ever leave us, Mother.

937
02:01:31,161 --> 02:01:34,721
The day I met Aliyar Bey,

938
02:01:35,081 --> 02:01:37,641
I saw what a big heart he had.

939
02:01:40,761 --> 02:01:44,481
Ertugrul Bey managed
to unite the Turk tribes,

940
02:01:44,961 --> 02:01:47,761
thanks to Aliyar Bey.

941
02:01:48,761 --> 02:01:50,361
May he rest in peace.

942
02:01:53,561 --> 02:01:55,521
I know I'm not alone

943
02:01:56,241 --> 02:01:58,601
thanks to you and Ertugrul Bey.

944
02:02:00,241 --> 02:02:03,721
My tribe and our honor are yours.

945
02:02:05,201 --> 02:02:06,361
May I come in?

946
02:02:09,361 --> 02:02:11,241
Please come in, Emir.

947
02:02:27,961 --> 02:02:32,601
I'm so sorry for your loss, dear.
I'll leave you alone.

948
02:02:34,721 --> 02:02:36,241
Please do.

949
02:02:39,761 --> 02:02:40,881
Hayme Hatun.

950
02:02:59,561 --> 02:03:00,921
<i>Bismillah</i>.

951
02:03:02,081 --> 02:03:04,401
Sit down, Aslihan. Sit down.

952
02:03:10,481 --> 02:03:14,041
My condolences.
May God grant you patience.

953
02:03:18,361 --> 02:03:23,481
Even through all this pain,
you still manage to stand tall.

954
02:03:23,961 --> 02:03:26,041
This is a great comfort to me.

955
02:03:28,241 --> 02:03:31,401
The way you conducted yourself
when that traitor Ural returned

956
02:03:31,881 --> 02:03:35,201
showed me how brave you are, but I
saw today how strong you are too.

957
02:03:37,241 --> 02:03:40,361
Ural is where he belongs, Emir.

958
02:03:41,401 --> 02:03:46,121
As for Aliyar Bey,
he gave his authority of the tribe to me.

959
02:03:49,001 --> 02:03:50,561
Of course, of course.

960
02:03:52,321 --> 02:03:58,481
You should perform this duty
until the council elects a new Bey.

961
02:04:01,521 --> 02:04:05,761
I don't intend to abandon my tribe
after the council has voted.

962
02:04:08,201 --> 02:04:11,121
The Cavdar tribe will always be my home.

963
02:04:15,921 --> 02:04:18,121
Do you realise
what you're saying, Aslihan?

964
02:04:22,481 --> 02:04:23,801
I do, Emir.

965
02:04:25,921 --> 02:04:28,041
When I agreed to be your wife

966
02:04:28,521 --> 02:04:32,081
to satisfy my father's wishes,
I had two brothers.

967
02:04:32,801 --> 02:04:33,801
I trusted them.

968
02:04:36,121 --> 02:04:38,761
Now one is martyred, the other killed.

969
02:04:40,081 --> 02:04:44,481
I won't leave my tribe until
my brother is avenged.

970
02:04:45,281 --> 02:04:48,041
Know that I would die for my tribe too.

971
02:04:56,041 --> 02:04:58,921
Pain has dulled your senses,
Aslihan Hatun.

972
02:05:01,041 --> 02:05:07,601
You promised to be my wife
and dedicate your life to me.

973
02:05:08,241 --> 02:05:11,881
You promised. Remember that.

974
02:05:15,121 --> 02:05:20,121
Forgive me, Emir. My decision is final.

975
02:05:26,321 --> 02:05:31,801
What makes you think you, a woman,
is capable of leading your tribe?

976
02:05:34,681 --> 02:05:40,761
If Mother Hayme has done it before,
so I am capable of doing it now.

977
02:05:43,081 --> 02:05:45,561
And I will have Ertugrul Bey by my side.

978
02:05:47,721 --> 02:05:48,841
Ertugrul.

979
02:05:51,201 --> 02:05:52,241
Ertugrul.

980
02:05:58,441 --> 02:05:59,361
Ertugrul?

981
02:06:03,881 --> 02:06:05,161
My decision is final.

982
02:06:06,801 --> 02:06:12,601
A glorious Emir like you will easily find
a more suitable woman than me.

983
02:06:14,201 --> 02:06:18,481
Now, if you'll allow me,
I'd like to mourn my brother in peace,

984
02:06:19,321 --> 02:06:21,641
at least for a day.

985
02:06:25,161 --> 02:06:30,521
It is my priority now to discuss
with Ertugrul Bey by what means

986
02:06:31,601 --> 02:06:33,441
he and I can avenge my brother.

987
02:06:37,401 --> 02:06:40,441
I know you are speaking out of grief.

988
02:06:42,641 --> 02:06:45,241
The pain will lessen with time.

989
02:06:47,761 --> 02:06:49,761
You'll see the mistake you've made.

990
02:06:56,881 --> 02:06:58,321
I'll wait for you, Aslihan.

991
02:07:01,721 --> 02:07:06,121
No matter how long it takes. I'll wait.

992
02:07:11,521 --> 02:07:12,801
You'll see.

993
02:07:19,721 --> 02:07:21,041
Excuse me.

994
02:08:04,441 --> 02:08:06,681
If Ebu Mansur really is Sultan Alaeddin,

995
02:08:07,321 --> 02:08:10,801
you can see now how Ekaterina
could change the fate of our country,

996
02:08:10,961 --> 02:08:12,921
can't you Nikolas?

997
02:08:13,601 --> 02:08:15,241
I don't doubt it.

998
02:08:15,978 --> 02:08:19,681
Ekaterina is capable of securing
you a great victory.

999
02:08:20,721 --> 02:08:23,321
I'm so pleased Ekaterina
has found the right path.

1000
02:08:24,641 --> 02:08:27,041
You revived a woman left without hope.

1001
02:08:31,121 --> 02:08:33,921
Her only mistake was believing in a Turk.

1002
02:08:34,521 --> 02:08:36,641
She has found the holy path now.

1003
02:08:36,961 --> 02:08:38,241
Smart woman.

1004
02:08:39,041 --> 02:08:42,721
Smart women can be dangerous.

1005
02:08:44,361 --> 02:08:48,441
I know that only too well, Nikolas.
Only too well.

1006
02:08:49,681 --> 02:08:51,601
That's why I keep her close.

1007
02:08:52,201 --> 02:08:55,321
You could keep her closer.

1008
02:08:56,121 --> 02:09:01,241
She's of noble birth.
When the day comes, she'd be worthy

1009
02:09:01,441 --> 02:09:03,801
of a governor set to become emperor.

1010
02:09:35,401 --> 02:09:37,521
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

1011
02:09:37,641 --> 02:09:39,321
Greetings, brothers.

1012
02:09:48,161 --> 02:09:49,841
I'm sorry for your loss, brother.

1013
02:09:50,321 --> 02:09:51,721
Sorry for your loss, brothers.

1014
02:09:51,841 --> 02:09:54,921
-Thank you.
-Thank you both.

1015
02:09:55,161 --> 02:09:56,201
Come, sit.

1016
02:09:57,201 --> 02:09:58,241
Brothers.

1017
02:10:06,681 --> 02:10:10,441
Candar Bey is gone.
The dog Ural Bey is also gone.

1018
02:10:11,041 --> 02:10:12,281
Our beys lie slaughtered.

1019
02:10:13,521 --> 02:10:15,281
Now, we are alone.

1020
02:10:17,681 --> 02:10:19,801
The great Cavdar tribe is leaderless.

1021
02:10:20,441 --> 02:10:22,441
It'll be very hard for us to regroup.

1022
02:10:25,721 --> 02:10:26,641
Brother...

1023
02:10:27,961 --> 02:10:29,121
Brothers...

1024
02:10:29,801 --> 02:10:31,241
We are as one.

1025
02:10:32,881 --> 02:10:35,481
Aliyar Bey was our bey as well.

1026
02:10:37,841 --> 02:10:41,961
Ertugrul Bey is our bey. Don't lose hope.

1027
02:10:42,161 --> 02:10:43,881
It's more complicated
than that, Bamsi Alp.

1028
02:10:44,641 --> 02:10:46,961
The bey of a tribe is its everything.

1029
02:10:47,681 --> 02:10:49,441
A beyless tribe cannot be.

1030
02:11:04,081 --> 02:11:07,321
-Greetings, Alps.
-Greetings.

1031
02:11:07,561 --> 02:11:09,041
Sir, you honor us.

1032
02:11:09,921 --> 02:11:10,761
Please.

1033
02:11:27,921 --> 02:11:32,121
Death brings joy to the deceased,
but pain to those left behind.

1034
02:11:34,801 --> 02:11:38,761
However, there should be
no sadness for martyrs.

1035
02:11:39,281 --> 02:11:43,681
Sir, we purged out tribe of traitors
and we stood united,

1036
02:11:43,881 --> 02:11:45,361
we had peace.

1037
02:11:46,241 --> 02:11:48,721
But now our bey and leader is gone.

1038
02:11:49,801 --> 02:11:51,361
What do we do now?

1039
02:11:55,401 --> 02:11:56,401
My children...

1040
02:11:59,761 --> 02:12:01,921
All this wasn't created in a day.

1041
02:12:03,441 --> 02:12:05,721
A great cause requires great sacrifice.

1042
02:12:06,681 --> 02:12:08,521
In the first years of Islam

1043
02:12:09,921 --> 02:12:12,761
we lost many of our leaders.

1044
02:12:14,761 --> 02:12:19,681
The Battles of Badr and Uhud,
and the Battle of the Trench.

1045
02:12:21,281 --> 02:12:23,841
Many people like Hamza,

1046
02:12:24,481 --> 02:12:29,041
Ja’far ibn Abi Talib, Ammar ibn Yasir,
and Yasir ibn Amir

1047
02:12:29,481 --> 02:12:31,801
were martyred for the cause.

1048
02:12:33,481 --> 02:12:35,921
War and death never ceased.

1049
02:12:37,281 --> 02:12:40,761
You have accepted the jihad for God

1050
02:12:43,041 --> 02:12:45,721
as a pillar of Islam.

1051
02:12:46,481 --> 02:12:50,401
But, do not forget this.

1052
02:12:53,121 --> 02:12:56,081
The distance the arrow travels
depends on how far it is pulled back.

1053
02:12:57,001 --> 02:12:59,401
Every time the enemy attacks you

1054
02:13:00,201 --> 02:13:02,441
and causes you pain,

1055
02:13:03,041 --> 02:13:05,801
you become stronger.

1056
02:13:09,121 --> 02:13:14,121
Our Prophet, peace be upon him,

1057
02:13:15,121 --> 02:13:17,161
when he passed away,

1058
02:13:18,521 --> 02:13:20,801
some Muslims lost hope.

1059
02:13:24,281 --> 02:13:27,001
Asap couldn't believe he had died,

1060
02:13:28,001 --> 02:13:30,281
he couldn't take on the responsibility.

1061
02:13:30,801 --> 02:13:33,161
But the cause of God had to go on,

1062
02:13:34,161 --> 02:13:36,481
the banner of Islam
still had to be carried.

1063
02:13:37,561 --> 02:13:42,721
So, Abu Bakr went to our prophet,

1064
02:13:43,761 --> 02:13:47,641
covered his face,
and faced the companions.

1065
02:13:48,881 --> 02:13:50,801
Abu Bakr said that,

1066
02:13:51,641 --> 02:13:56,561
whoever believes in Muhammad,
peace be upon him,

1067
02:13:57,441 --> 02:14:00,241
know that he's in heaven.

1068
02:14:04,441 --> 02:14:07,601
Whoever prays to and serves God,

1069
02:14:08,441 --> 02:14:11,281
know that God is immortal.

1070
02:14:13,521 --> 02:14:17,121
Then he recited these verses from
the <i>surah Ali Imran</i>.

1071
02:14:19,401 --> 02:14:22,201
"Muhammad is but a messenger.

1072
02:14:24,481 --> 02:14:27,241
Other messengers have
passed on before him.

1073
02:14:28,721 --> 02:14:31,601
So if he was to die or be killed...

1074
02:14:33,361 --> 02:14:36,601
would you turn back
and no longer believe?

1075
02:14:39,441 --> 02:14:41,521
He who turns back...

1076
02:14:42,841 --> 02:14:44,881
cannot harm God.

1077
02:14:46,641 --> 02:14:49,361
But God will reward the grateful."

1078
02:14:50,721 --> 02:14:56,081
Ashap was shaken by these words
and they regained hope.

1079
02:14:57,201 --> 02:14:59,721
They adopted the cause of Islam.

1080
02:15:00,601 --> 02:15:04,441
So Islam was spread throughout the world.

1081
02:15:05,241 --> 02:15:09,041
Gave hope to innocents, fear to tyrants.

1082
02:15:10,481 --> 02:15:13,601
Holy God has said in the<i> surah Ali Imran,</i>

1083
02:15:14,441 --> 02:15:16,121
"So, do not weaken.

1084
02:15:16,881 --> 02:15:18,281
Do not grieve.

1085
02:15:19,601 --> 02:15:23,681
And you will be superior
if you are true believers."

1086
02:15:25,881 --> 02:15:28,321
We need brave men like Ali

1087
02:15:29,081 --> 02:15:33,761
and those who will uphold his legacy,
like Hussein.

1088
02:15:35,361 --> 02:15:36,881
The <i>Ummah </i>awaits salvation.

1089
02:15:37,521 --> 02:15:39,441
Humanity awaits service.

1090
02:15:40,801 --> 02:15:45,641
Now, you must fight for tomorrow.

1091
02:15:48,401 --> 02:15:51,361
Yesterday you were led by Aliyar Bey.

1092
02:15:51,801 --> 02:15:54,281
Today, by Ertugrul Bey.

1093
02:15:56,721 --> 02:15:58,281
Now, you must...

1094
02:15:59,721 --> 02:16:02,521
keep the cause of your Bey alive,

1095
02:16:03,241 --> 02:16:07,161
unite and follow the path of the union.

1096
02:16:43,601 --> 02:16:45,321
Mother, welcome.

1097
02:16:46,081 --> 02:16:47,361
Thank you, dear.

1098
02:16:49,561 --> 02:16:52,641
Is he asleep? God bless him.

1099
02:17:07,961 --> 02:17:10,881
We carried out our last duty.

1100
02:17:15,001 --> 02:17:17,081
Aliyar was like a son to me.

1101
02:17:18,601 --> 02:17:22,961
Seeing him with Ertugrul
used to make me so happy.

1102
02:17:24,481 --> 02:17:28,721
He was a brother to Ertugrul
and a son to me.

1103
02:17:32,281 --> 02:17:34,361
Death only brings joy
to the martyr, Mother.

1104
02:17:36,241 --> 02:17:38,961
But it's hard on the ones left behind.

1105
02:17:39,841 --> 02:17:43,881
This sad heart has said
goodbye to many warriors.

1106
02:17:45,481 --> 02:17:46,801
Now I realize that...

1107
02:17:48,041 --> 02:17:50,521
Aliyar had a special place in my heart.

1108
02:17:53,321 --> 02:17:55,081
Death is inevitable.

1109
02:17:56,961 --> 02:17:59,161
Aliyar Bey was blessed with martyrdom.

1110
02:18:00,481 --> 02:18:03,281
You're right, dear. You're right.

1111
02:18:06,561 --> 02:18:10,441
-May God grant him rest.
-Amen.

1112
02:18:13,401 --> 02:18:16,481
Mother, was Ebu Mansur at the funeral?

1113
02:18:16,681 --> 02:18:17,881
He was, dear.

1114
02:18:18,681 --> 02:18:21,641
Ertugrul never left his side.

1115
02:18:26,721 --> 02:18:28,561
Do you still doubt him?

1116
02:18:31,121 --> 02:18:34,521
Mother, this Ebu Mansur is no
ordinary merchant.

1117
02:18:37,841 --> 02:18:39,721
I've remembered who he is.

1118
02:18:41,721 --> 02:18:42,681
Who is he?

1119
02:18:44,601 --> 02:18:45,681
Sultan Alaeddin.

1120
02:18:54,521 --> 02:18:56,641
Do you know what you're saying, Halime?

1121
02:18:58,481 --> 02:19:01,041
-Are you sure?
-Yes, Mother, I'm sure.

1122
02:19:02,001 --> 02:19:05,081
I saw Uncle Alaeddin
before he became Sultan.

1123
02:19:05,761 --> 02:19:07,001
That's how I know.

1124
02:19:31,921 --> 02:19:34,001
Were you expecting Emir Sadettin,
my Sultan?

1125
02:19:34,401 --> 02:19:35,321
No.

1126
02:19:37,201 --> 02:19:38,761
But it's good he's here.

1127
02:19:39,641 --> 02:19:42,121
He should know of my decision
concerning your new duty.

1128
02:19:43,841 --> 02:19:47,321
When I return, I'll leave
Sadettin here to support you.

1129
02:20:04,161 --> 02:20:05,081
My Sultan.

1130
02:20:12,201 --> 02:20:14,241
What brings you here, Sadettin?

1131
02:20:16,921 --> 02:20:19,521
My marriage to Aslihan Hatun, my Sultan.

1132
02:20:20,841 --> 02:20:25,921
But her father's death,
and now Aliyar Bey...

1133
02:20:27,481 --> 02:20:28,881
It's good that you're here.

1134
02:20:30,241 --> 02:20:32,521
That you came in time
for Aliyar Bey's funeral.

1135
02:20:36,121 --> 02:20:40,281
Also, after talking over some
matters with Ertugrul Bey,

1136
02:20:40,401 --> 02:20:42,201
I've come to a decision.

1137
02:20:45,401 --> 02:20:47,041
A decision you should be told about.

1138
02:20:51,121 --> 02:20:53,321
I hope it's good news, my Sultan.

1139
02:20:55,641 --> 02:20:59,921
Ertugrul Bey is now
the chief Bey of my state.

1140
02:21:05,221 --> 02:21:07,461
He will govern these lands.

1141
02:21:16,261 --> 02:21:20,381
It's an honor for me to serve
my state and nation, my Sultan.
