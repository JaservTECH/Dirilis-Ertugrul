00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 88 will start after 12:32 min.

12:47.499 --> 12:50.099
This is the end of your fame, Ertuğrul.

12:51.059 --> 12:52.419
You can take all the fame.

12:53.259 --> 12:54.979
Martyrdom will suffice for us.

13:05.779 --> 13:10.059
Come on!

13:58.099 --> 13:59.539
Where are these arrows coming from?

14:27.579 --> 14:28.899
Attack!

14:39.099 --> 14:40.339
Sultan!

16:55.539 --> 16:57.299
Who are they, Nikolas?

16:57.379 --> 16:59.539
They have more men than us,
we will lose. Let's go.

16:59.659 --> 17:01.259
We won't lose! Attack!

18:50.059 --> 18:51.699
Just a bit more, Halime Sultan.

18:51.859 --> 18:53.499
Keep pushing.

18:53.619 --> 18:54.899
-A bit more.
-Breathe.

18:54.979 --> 18:56.179
Push.

18:56.339 --> 18:57.459
Push, Halime.

18:57.779 --> 18:59.099
-Come on.
-Come on.

19:06.951 --> 19:08.284
Congratulations, Halime.

19:11.579 --> 19:12.699
Dear God!

19:14.019 --> 19:16.499
-Thank God.
-Congratulations, Halime Sultan.

19:17.219 --> 19:19.339
He's a boy.

19:33.979 --> 19:35.339
God bless.

19:35.899 --> 19:37.619
God bless him.

19:40.459 --> 19:41.739
My love.

19:42.019 --> 19:43.139
God bless.

19:45.939 --> 19:47.139
God bless.

19:48.019 --> 19:49.179
My love.

19:49.339 --> 19:50.779
How sweet!

20:04.259 --> 20:05.779
Surrender, Ertuğrul.

20:07.979 --> 20:09.619
There's no way out.

20:10.099 --> 20:12.739
We only surrender to God, Vasilius.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.659
To the last of our breath.

20:36.619 --> 20:37.539
Ertuğrul!

23:33.019 --> 23:34.499
This is just the beginning.

23:52.579 --> 23:54.299
Aliyar Bey! Brother!

23:55.219 --> 23:56.179
Brother!

23:56.779 --> 23:57.779
Brother!

23:58.779 --> 24:00.139
We must retreat, Vasilius.

24:00.419 --> 24:02.899
No. Either he dies, or I die.

24:03.099 --> 24:05.139
For our cause, Vasilius. Come on.

24:05.699 --> 24:06.579
Come on.

24:08.819 --> 24:10.139
You are coming with me.

24:26.619 --> 24:27.819
Ishak!

24:31.699 --> 24:32.859
Ishak!

24:37.779 --> 24:40.059
Abdur Rahman, Bamsi. Come with me.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.648
I love you so much, my baby boy.

25:03.728 --> 25:05.088
Look at those silky hands.

25:08.848 --> 25:10.408
That heavenly smell.

25:11.768 --> 25:13.288
Healthy and beautiful.

25:14.408 --> 25:16.128
God bless you.

25:19.048 --> 25:22.088
Come on, hop in to your mother's arms.

25:24.128 --> 25:25.488
God bless.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.368
May God let him grow with his parents.

25:32.168 --> 25:33.848
Here, take him.

25:37.608 --> 25:40.208
I love you so much, my baby boy.

25:49.848 --> 25:50.808
Mother.

25:51.848 --> 25:53.528
Has Ertuğrul returned yet?

25:55.408 --> 25:57.608
He will, my dear. Be patient.

25:58.048 --> 25:59.408
Don't worry.

25:59.728 --> 26:00.608
Okay.

26:05.728 --> 26:10.328
Please God, I beg you.

26:11.768 --> 26:14.808
Let him return safe and sound
and see his son.

26:16.008 --> 26:16.928
Amen.

26:18.008 --> 26:19.728
Please protect him

26:20.328 --> 26:22.808
and his friends from the evil doers.

26:23.568 --> 26:24.608
Amen.

26:26.768 --> 26:28.448
Let's be strong now.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.928
They will surely come back.

26:31.448 --> 26:32.608
I hope so.

26:32.688 --> 26:34.408
-Hopefully, my dear.
-Hopefully.

27:35.608 --> 27:38.128
Aliyar Bey, open your eyes.

27:38.528 --> 27:39.528
Aliyar Bey.

27:44.008 --> 27:45.088
He's alive.

27:45.728 --> 27:47.328
Put more pressure on it.

27:49.008 --> 27:49.848
Sir.

27:51.248 --> 27:53.648
He's lost too much blood,
and his wound is deep.

27:54.288 --> 27:55.608
The bastard got away.

28:04.568 --> 28:05.608
Turgut.

28:09.448 --> 28:10.888
Slowly.

28:11.648 --> 28:12.808
Easy.

28:13.368 --> 28:14.848
You've gone through worse than this.

28:15.328 --> 28:16.928
Come on.

28:26.208 --> 28:28.088
God bless you, Your Highness.

28:29.168 --> 28:30.288
If it weren't for you--

28:30.408 --> 28:31.888
Ebu Mansur, Ertuğrul Bey.

28:32.768 --> 28:34.088
Call me that for now.

28:34.808 --> 28:37.288
We aided you, but God saved you.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.368
We'll talk at the camp.

28:40.488 --> 28:42.048
Yes, sir.

28:45.248 --> 28:46.328
Ishak.

28:46.448 --> 28:48.968
We're going back to the camp.
Carry the wounded.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.688
-Come on, brother.
-Come on.

28:50.848 --> 28:52.368
-Don't be rough.
-Up.

28:54.608 --> 28:55.488
Help.

28:59.968 --> 29:01.088
God bless.

29:01.728 --> 29:03.528
Such a healthy boy.

29:03.848 --> 29:06.208
May he live with his mother and father.

29:06.368 --> 29:07.368
Amen.

29:07.968 --> 29:10.208
Amen. Thank you, dear.

29:12.528 --> 29:14.808
Next is Banu Çiçek, God willing.

29:15.208 --> 29:16.368
Hopefully.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.888
Thank God you are with us, Mother Hayme.

29:23.728 --> 29:26.008
My first grandson.

29:26.128 --> 29:28.368
Come here, look who is here.

29:28.448 --> 29:29.408
Gündüz.

29:29.528 --> 29:31.008
Is this my brother?

29:32.088 --> 29:34.688
I need soldiers. Let me have a look.

29:34.808 --> 29:35.728
Look.

29:39.448 --> 29:41.768
Let me make my brother a sword.

29:41.888 --> 29:44.088
You take care of him now.

29:44.168 --> 29:45.248
Okay.

29:50.088 --> 29:53.808
As little as he may be,
he's already acting all high and mighty.

29:56.448 --> 29:58.368
May God never let them suffer.

29:58.488 --> 29:59.608
Amen.

30:00.088 --> 30:01.248
Amen.

30:02.848 --> 30:05.688
Ertuğrul Bey will be overjoyed to see him.

30:07.088 --> 30:08.088
Mother.

30:08.968 --> 30:11.328
Is there any news from them?

30:11.688 --> 30:13.168
When will they come back?

30:19.648 --> 30:22.368
After I lost my father,
I can't bear more of this pain.

30:26.288 --> 30:28.648
May God let them get back safely.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.568
Do not tempt fate, dear.

30:53.608 --> 30:55.048
What could it be?

30:55.968 --> 30:57.448
Nothing bad, I hope.

31:38.728 --> 31:41.888
Please God, protect my children.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.528
It's Aliyar Bey.

32:11.008 --> 32:12.288
It's Aliyar Bey.

32:12.648 --> 32:14.368
Aliyar Bey is wounded.

32:14.648 --> 32:16.088
Who did this?

32:16.688 --> 32:17.888
Make way.

32:45.648 --> 32:47.568
-Aliyar!
-Aliyar!

32:48.568 --> 32:49.728
Oh, my God!

32:49.888 --> 32:51.768
-Brother!
-Son.

32:51.888 --> 32:54.968
Please, open your eyes, brother.

32:55.128 --> 32:56.208
Artuk Bey!

32:56.608 --> 32:58.488
Don't leave me alone.

32:58.928 --> 33:00.528
-Brother.
-Make way.

33:00.608 --> 33:01.448
Brother.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.888
-Take him to the healing tent.
-Right away.

33:05.008 --> 33:07.408
Ishak, you take care
of the wounded. Hurry up!

33:07.488 --> 33:08.448
-Get him up.
-Up.

33:08.608 --> 33:10.048
-Be quick about it.
-Don't rock it.

33:17.528 --> 33:18.728
Don't be rough.

33:19.088 --> 33:20.728
How is Halime Sultan, Mother?

33:22.088 --> 33:24.928
You have a beautiful and healthy son.

33:25.248 --> 33:26.968
Halime is okay, too.

33:28.488 --> 33:30.008
Go and see your wife.

34:00.568 --> 34:01.448
Ertuğrul...

34:01.888 --> 34:03.168
Don't get up, Halime.

34:05.848 --> 34:07.888
Thank God you are back.
Welcome back.

34:08.408 --> 34:09.528
Thank you.

34:24.008 --> 34:24.968
Son.

34:26.888 --> 34:28.048
My son.

34:30.648 --> 34:32.008
My baby son.

34:40.448 --> 34:42.848
You and our son have been
on my mind the entire time, Halime.

34:43.808 --> 34:47.368
Now that I have seen you're well,
I'd die a happy man.

34:48.528 --> 34:51.048
And I've been waiting for you
to come back, Ertuğrul.

34:52.568 --> 34:56.528
I prayed to God to let you
see our son.

35:00.928 --> 35:05.248
Sometimes, we must leave
our loved ones behind for the cause.

35:07.368 --> 35:09.848
Ertuğrul, you are following God's cause.

35:10.808 --> 35:13.608
Now that you are back alive and well,
that's good enough.

35:19.768 --> 35:20.968
What happened?

35:21.568 --> 35:22.928
You look sad.

35:25.208 --> 35:26.448
Vasilius.

35:27.648 --> 35:29.568
He found out where we were going.

35:31.568 --> 35:33.008
We fell into his trap.

35:34.928 --> 35:36.488
If it weren't for Ebu Mansur,

35:37.808 --> 35:39.088
we'd have been done for.

35:40.448 --> 35:44.008
Ebu Mansur? Who is that?

35:45.888 --> 35:48.688
I told you before that I knew about him.

35:49.608 --> 35:52.608
But how did it turn out like this?

35:56.848 --> 35:57.848
Aliyar Bey...

36:00.328 --> 36:01.528
is wounded.

36:03.488 --> 36:04.848
He's badly hurt.

36:15.168 --> 36:16.608
How many times has it been Nikolas?

36:17.088 --> 36:18.688
Just how many times?

36:19.248 --> 36:22.608
How many more times are we going to
return with dead bodies

36:22.688 --> 36:25.048
when instead we should be
taking Ertuğrul's head?

36:25.168 --> 36:26.168
How many times?

36:26.248 --> 36:28.088
-Sir.
-What?

36:28.528 --> 36:31.248
Apologies,
there is a messenger from Nicaea.

36:31.408 --> 36:34.648
He said he had information
that he could only tell you.

36:37.048 --> 36:39.088
A letter from the emperor for you, sir.

36:41.928 --> 36:42.968
Leave.

36:45.368 --> 36:49.128
God damn the emperor
and his cursed letter!

36:55.688 --> 36:58.728
It all changed when he arrived.

36:59.448 --> 37:01.648
We wouldn't have lost if
it weren't for him.

37:02.208 --> 37:05.248
You could have taken...

37:05.928 --> 37:07.208
Ertuğrul's life.

37:08.568 --> 37:10.368
Ebu Mansur.

37:11.208 --> 37:12.848
He's supposedly a merchant.

37:14.168 --> 37:16.128
But his real identity is a mystery.

37:19.488 --> 37:23.768
I don't know who he is,
but it's obvious what he is not.

37:25.728 --> 37:27.608
He's not a merchant,

37:28.488 --> 37:30.088
but a warrior.

37:32.328 --> 37:34.568
Is there even a soldier here
that fights as well as him?

37:35.928 --> 37:38.008
He's not from around here, Nikolas.

37:38.568 --> 37:40.528
They were the sultan's men.

37:41.848 --> 37:44.088
They're coming to take my fort.

37:45.368 --> 37:47.888
An advance party.
There'll be more if we don't stop them.

37:48.168 --> 37:50.568
Then, the one called Ebu Mansur

37:50.928 --> 37:53.648
must be one of the best commanders
of the sultan.

37:56.568 --> 37:58.808
No, more than a commander.

38:00.248 --> 38:03.128
Someone more important
and with more power.

38:05.008 --> 38:06.008
But who?

38:09.368 --> 38:11.688
-We'll find out.
-How?

38:12.488 --> 38:14.328
We don't even know where he is.

38:16.528 --> 38:19.408
Where could a man wearing
merchant clothes stay?

38:19.928 --> 38:21.688
At Hanlı Bazaar, of course.

38:22.408 --> 38:25.208
Send two men after him
and watch him right away.

38:38.328 --> 38:39.808
Read this, sir.

39:01.968 --> 39:03.768
Sultan Alaeddin, huh?

39:08.328 --> 39:11.088
In disguise amongst commoners.

39:17.968 --> 39:19.488
What's the meaning of this?

39:20.488 --> 39:24.048
We now know Ebu Mansur's identity,
that is what it means.

39:27.888 --> 39:29.088
That man...

39:30.608 --> 39:31.928
Is that even possible?

39:32.928 --> 39:34.848
How brazen would he have to be?

39:35.648 --> 39:38.088
He'd never risk his life coming
all the way here.

39:39.168 --> 39:42.088
-You are wrong, Vasilius.
-He would.

39:42.808 --> 39:44.408
Sultan Alaeddin

39:44.808 --> 39:48.328
first wants to see the place
he'd like to conquer.

39:48.648 --> 39:49.808
He has done it before.

39:52.528 --> 39:53.888
But now,

39:56.448 --> 39:58.808
we must make sure it's him.

39:59.568 --> 40:02.328
But how?
Is there anyone that would recognize him?

40:08.768 --> 40:10.408
Yes, Nikolas.

40:10.728 --> 40:12.168
There's someone.

40:54.408 --> 40:56.248
We are honored to have you, Your Highness.

41:31.728 --> 41:32.808
Come.

41:34.208 --> 41:35.568
Sit with Ebu Mansur.

41:47.688 --> 41:51.368
Ertuğrul Bey, I wish I didn't have to
show up on such a dreary day.

41:54.008 --> 41:55.728
How is Aliyar Bey?

41:57.648 --> 41:59.488
He's in a bad condition, Your Highness.

42:02.528 --> 42:05.488
I hope to God that he recovers quickly.

42:06.168 --> 42:07.168
I hope so.

42:07.728 --> 42:09.368
Never lose your hope.

42:12.328 --> 42:13.328
On the other hand,

42:14.168 --> 42:16.808
the good news is that you have a son.

42:19.528 --> 42:21.208
I have one more son, Your Highness.

42:23.728 --> 42:24.648
May God...

42:25.768 --> 42:28.688
let him grow up to be a gallant warrior
such as yourself.

42:28.968 --> 42:29.968
Amen.

42:33.528 --> 42:34.808
Ertuğrul Bey.

42:37.888 --> 42:39.248
What happened at the inn?

42:39.848 --> 42:41.408
Tell me everything.

42:44.928 --> 42:46.208
Your eye in Nicaea...

42:47.368 --> 42:49.008
was exposed, Your Highness.

42:49.968 --> 42:51.888
He was on the run
from the emperor's soldiers.

42:52.368 --> 42:54.608
He had something very important
to tell you.

42:55.248 --> 42:56.248
However,

42:57.008 --> 42:59.888
Vasilius found him
before us and killed him.

43:01.928 --> 43:04.448
Could you find out
what he was going to tell me?

43:10.088 --> 43:13.208
He sent me this seal with his comrade.

43:52.408 --> 43:53.448
Ertuğrul Bey.

43:54.888 --> 43:59.288
There's a traitor from the government
in the Sultan's castle.

44:01.128 --> 44:03.048
You must tell our Sultan quickly.

44:21.408 --> 44:23.848
They tried to take my life twice.

44:26.128 --> 44:28.648
I suspected there was
a traitor in my castle.

44:29.608 --> 44:31.408
Now I have no more doubts.

44:32.408 --> 44:37.008
They're attacking our country
from the east and west.

44:38.048 --> 44:40.928
As if that wasn't enough,

44:41.648 --> 44:43.608
we have a traitor now?

44:45.448 --> 44:46.728
If that's how it is,

44:47.488 --> 44:49.968
then it's dangerous
for you to be here, Your Highness.

45:01.128 --> 45:02.768
I am the real threat here,

45:03.928 --> 45:06.408
for my enemies, Ertuğrul Bey.

45:10.048 --> 45:12.488
I'll find out who is the traitor
in my castle, sooner or later.

45:15.928 --> 45:16.928
However,

45:17.608 --> 45:19.408
the real issue today is...

45:20.288 --> 45:21.888
Karacahisar Castle.

45:23.248 --> 45:26.728
The fate of the Turkmen Tribes
rests on your decision, Your Highness.

45:28.088 --> 45:30.288
We tried to protect the peace
as per your orders.

45:30.968 --> 45:32.768
However, we lost many men.

45:34.128 --> 45:36.048
War is now inevitable.

45:37.528 --> 45:40.248
I came here to see Karacahisar Castle
with my own eyes

45:40.368 --> 45:42.768
and give my final decision, Ertuğrul Bey.

45:44.608 --> 45:46.408
I've talked to many men

45:47.008 --> 45:49.768
as Merchant Ebu Mansur
for the last five days.

45:50.648 --> 45:52.928
My armies are preparing for war
in the east.

45:54.128 --> 45:57.368
Before I join my armies,
I'd like to consult you,

45:57.448 --> 45:58.928
my finest bey...

46:02.048 --> 46:04.128
that knows these lands.

46:04.848 --> 46:06.768
Be my guest at the marquee, Your Highness.

46:07.968 --> 46:11.648
We must keep this secret, Ertuğrul Bey.

46:15.528 --> 46:17.608
I'd like to stay at the inn
with the guards.

46:18.928 --> 46:22.568
But I'm worried about
Aliyar Bey's condition.

46:23.288 --> 46:24.848
I'll stay with your tribe tonight.

46:25.528 --> 46:27.088
However, not at your marquee,

46:27.608 --> 46:28.968
but in the guest tent.

46:30.968 --> 46:32.448
I don't want to attract any attention.

47:08.728 --> 47:11.008
Gone!

47:12.328 --> 47:14.288
Slipped from our grasp!

47:15.568 --> 47:17.208
Killed our brothers!

47:17.688 --> 47:19.168
They got Aliyar Bey as well.

47:20.728 --> 47:22.568
Aliyar Bey is still alive, Bamsi.

47:23.688 --> 47:25.208
Don't lose hope.

47:28.488 --> 47:30.568
If Ebu Mansur had not made it...

47:31.808 --> 47:33.248
we would have died.

47:36.888 --> 47:39.328
Who is that merchant?

47:40.128 --> 47:41.648
Are you not curious?

47:41.888 --> 47:43.768
You are right, brother.

47:44.728 --> 47:48.648
I've never seen a merchant
that fought so well.

47:49.768 --> 47:50.728
My brothers.

47:51.728 --> 47:53.248
If you ask me,

47:54.248 --> 47:55.728
he is no merchant.

47:58.048 --> 48:00.288
He's not just clever, but strong as well.

48:02.168 --> 48:05.408
His speaks softly, but his mind is sharp.

48:06.248 --> 48:08.608
We spoke before the rug deal briefly.

48:08.888 --> 48:10.848
He's both knowledgeable,
and a decent man.

48:11.008 --> 48:12.008
Yeah.

48:13.048 --> 48:14.968
All their shots hit the mark, too.

48:16.888 --> 48:19.448
Apparently, trading is not
their only occupation.

48:21.448 --> 48:23.408
They are all brave warriors.

48:23.688 --> 48:26.648
Ertuğrul Bey was stunned
to see Ebu Mansur.

48:28.648 --> 48:31.448
There must be an underlying reason
as to why he respects him so much.

48:38.968 --> 48:41.848
Come on, brothers. Dress your wounds.

48:42.888 --> 48:43.808
And then...

48:45.368 --> 48:46.848
pray for Aliyar Bey.

48:59.488 --> 49:00.488
Sir.

49:02.208 --> 49:03.488
<i>Bismillah.</i>

49:34.928 --> 49:35.928
Brother.

49:37.048 --> 49:37.968
Brother.

49:38.608 --> 49:40.448
I beg you.

49:49.688 --> 49:50.808
Brother.

49:53.048 --> 49:56.848
Artuk Bey, please tell me
that he's going to live.

49:59.088 --> 50:01.688
He's the only one that...

50:03.608 --> 50:05.568
holds together our tattered tribe.

50:06.528 --> 50:08.128
If something happens to him,

50:09.408 --> 50:10.528
all this blood...

50:12.088 --> 50:14.168
and these tears will have been in vain.

50:18.968 --> 50:21.408
His condition is bad, Aslıhan Hatun.

50:22.088 --> 50:24.008
Be prepared, anything could happen.

50:24.808 --> 50:27.648
But don't lose hope.

50:45.408 --> 50:48.288
Aliyar Bey shielded me
with his body in the battle.

50:49.968 --> 50:51.208
He cared about you...

50:52.128 --> 50:54.968
much more than he cared
about himself, Ertuğrul Bey.

51:00.888 --> 51:02.368
He wouldn't stop to think...

51:04.328 --> 51:06.568
even if he had a thousand lives.

51:09.488 --> 51:10.448
It's the same...

51:11.968 --> 51:12.968
for me as well.

51:17.048 --> 51:20.408
It's your duty
to hold your tribe together...

51:21.488 --> 51:24.288
until he recovers and comes back,
Aslıhan Hatun.

51:26.488 --> 51:29.008
Aliyar Bey chose you
as his representative.

51:31.528 --> 51:34.488
Don't let all the blood spilled
be in vain.

51:35.648 --> 51:37.408
You've been badly hurt,

51:38.528 --> 51:40.008
and gone through a lot.

51:40.808 --> 51:42.048
Be a leader,

51:42.768 --> 51:45.088
and give hope to your people.

51:46.608 --> 51:48.648
Look out for your tribe, Aslıhan Hatun.

51:51.688 --> 51:53.448
If something happens to him,

51:54.528 --> 51:56.568
what do we do, Ertuğrul Bey?

51:58.848 --> 52:00.608
All our beys are dead.

52:01.288 --> 52:04.008
Our soldiers are run-down
with all the betrayals.

52:06.168 --> 52:08.328
The tribe's been awash with our own blood.

52:09.968 --> 52:13.288
I'll pray to God that he doesn't take
this brave man from us.

52:18.808 --> 52:20.728
And if it did happen...

52:22.728 --> 52:23.848
know that...

52:25.688 --> 52:27.848
I, Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah,

52:28.128 --> 52:30.928
will always be on your side,
along with my tribe.

53:23.048 --> 53:24.008
Men!

53:26.168 --> 53:29.008
Enough of this. Why are you all sulking?

53:30.968 --> 53:32.248
Pull yourselves together.

53:38.808 --> 53:40.808
Even the women caring for their husbands

53:41.008 --> 53:44.168
and mothers waiting for their sons
are stronger than you.

53:45.248 --> 53:46.488
Snap out of it!

53:49.448 --> 53:52.248
Turgut Commander,
you know how Aliyar Bey is.

53:53.808 --> 53:56.608
We couldn't even
protect Ertuğrul Bey at the inn.

53:56.728 --> 53:57.768
God forbid.

54:02.728 --> 54:04.408
What if something happened to our bey?

54:05.968 --> 54:07.608
I feel ashamed as an alp.

54:16.808 --> 54:17.928
My brothers.

54:18.848 --> 54:21.728
We all fought well.

54:23.808 --> 54:25.768
We took down most of them.

54:31.768 --> 54:33.128
That dog Vasilius...

54:33.968 --> 54:36.088
turned his tail and ran, right?

54:36.328 --> 54:37.888
Yes, indeed.

54:38.128 --> 54:40.528
He ran away, the bastard.

54:40.888 --> 54:42.848
To hell with him.

54:43.728 --> 54:47.328
He ran away with his tail
between his legs like the coward he is.

54:49.288 --> 54:53.528
Do you remember what happened
when we were taking Hafsa Hatun

54:54.008 --> 54:55.168
to her father, the governor?

54:55.368 --> 54:56.448
What happened?

54:56.768 --> 54:59.088
That dog Vasilius ambushed us.

54:59.208 --> 55:00.688
Who came to our help then?

55:05.248 --> 55:06.528
<i>Woah!</i>

55:07.808 --> 55:09.048
<i>We're being attacked!</i>

55:09.528 --> 55:12.888
<i>-For God!</i>
<i>-For God!</i>

55:14.768 --> 55:16.608
<i>For God!</i>

55:36.768 --> 55:37.768
Helena!

55:55.048 --> 55:56.048
Aliyar Bey.

55:56.368 --> 55:59.728
He came like the wind
and saved us all.

56:00.088 --> 56:02.768
And then vanished into thin air.

56:03.208 --> 56:06.208
Yeah. He knew what
Ural would do and was prepared.

56:06.368 --> 56:09.168
He risked his life for us.

56:09.288 --> 56:12.528
Who helped Ertuğrul Bey
every single time

56:12.688 --> 56:15.288
that we were in trouble?

57:04.048 --> 57:07.928
Aliyar Bey. He always came as a godsend.

57:08.688 --> 57:11.048
Yes, he did, my brother.

57:11.368 --> 57:12.688
Indeed he did.

57:13.888 --> 57:15.248
With his sword,

57:16.368 --> 57:18.568
he always fought bravely
beside Ertuğrul Bey,

57:19.888 --> 57:22.488
as a worthy soldier

57:22.928 --> 57:24.848
of our prophet Ali, right?

57:25.568 --> 57:27.128
Yes, he did.

57:27.408 --> 57:28.888
He did, indeed.

57:29.328 --> 57:32.728
But if it wasn't for Ebu Mansur
we'd be in trouble.

57:33.128 --> 57:38.368
Yes, if it weren't for him,
both tribes would be left without a bey.

57:39.448 --> 57:43.408
Right. Then, how could we have explained
it to our bey and Aslıhan Hatun?

57:44.408 --> 57:50.488
However, my brothers,
just as Aliyar Bey reached out for us,

57:50.608 --> 57:54.088
Ebu Mansur came as a godsend, too.

57:54.328 --> 57:55.928
Now you are talking, brother.

57:57.088 --> 58:00.488
Ebu Mansur came just in time, thank God!

58:02.768 --> 58:07.728
God did not leave us alone on the path
of Ertuğrul Bey's cause, again.

58:08.288 --> 58:09.288
Right, brother.

58:09.448 --> 58:12.448
In the past, it was Aliyar Bey.
And now it was Ebu Mansur.

58:13.368 --> 58:17.048
We got one step closer
to his cause, brothers.

58:18.608 --> 58:20.128
With God's permission,

58:21.848 --> 58:24.968
we have nothing to be
ashamed of as alps.

58:25.888 --> 58:27.888
Turgut is right, my men.

58:28.568 --> 58:33.368
From now on,
we can't be upset by such things.

58:33.888 --> 58:38.208
Now what befalls us is to take revenge.

58:38.368 --> 58:40.568
Our revenge will be so brutal

58:41.088 --> 58:44.528
that even the soil will spit back
the blood of those bastards.

58:44.808 --> 58:47.528
They will not find a place
to rest their dead bodies.

58:48.848 --> 58:52.448
The arrow
has already left the bow.

58:52.528 --> 58:54.368
Unless we find that dog Vasilius,

58:54.768 --> 58:59.048
and avenge our brother Doğan,
as well as the blood

58:59.168 --> 59:02.848
of all the other men we lost,
we can't stop. Understand?

59:02.968 --> 59:07.448
May we never stop until
we take their revenge.

59:07.688 --> 59:11.168
Brothers, this will be such a war

59:11.288 --> 59:14.728
that with Ertuğrul Bey on our right,
and Aliyar Bey on our left,

59:15.328 --> 59:18.248
we will make the heavens tremble
with the sound of our swords.

59:18.488 --> 59:20.968
This will be such a war that

59:21.168 --> 59:23.448
our dead will rise
from their graves in respect.

59:23.648 --> 59:30.248
Our brother Doğan
will fight alongside us, brothers.

59:30.408 --> 59:32.128
God bless you all!

59:32.728 --> 59:38.248
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

59:38.488 --> 59:42.688
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

59:54.328 --> 59:57.048
<i>Ekaterina, it's me.</i>
<i>We must talk.</i>

59:57.328 --> 59:58.448
Come in, Vasilius.

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:15.008
Now that you are home,
you look even more dazzling.

01:00:15.488 --> 01:00:18.688
We age too fast, Vasilius.
Time flies away.

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.008
And we are still empty-handed.

01:00:21.448 --> 01:00:23.008
That's not true at all.

01:00:23.528 --> 01:00:24.608
What happened?

01:00:25.408 --> 01:00:26.408
Aliyar.

01:00:26.808 --> 01:00:27.808
Is he dead or what?

01:00:28.248 --> 01:00:32.448
Maybe not, but he won't live long
with those wounds.

01:00:33.168 --> 01:00:35.928
Ertuğrul was supposed to share his fate,

01:00:36.528 --> 01:00:40.688
but somebody turned up
and saved him along with his men.

01:00:41.768 --> 01:00:42.688
Who was it?

01:00:45.168 --> 01:00:47.168
It's on you to find out who.

01:01:05.648 --> 01:01:06.608
Ural...

01:01:08.568 --> 01:01:11.928
said you went to Konya
with him some time ago.

01:01:14.928 --> 01:01:17.688
Did you see Sultan Alaeddin then?

01:01:19.128 --> 01:01:21.288
What does Sultan Alaeddin have to do
with this?

01:01:21.408 --> 01:01:22.968
Did you or did you not?

01:01:23.248 --> 01:01:26.608
It's true that I went to Konya
with Candar Bey and Ural Bey.

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:28.928
We attended the circumcision feast

01:01:29.088 --> 01:01:30.808
of the Sultan's son,
Izzettin Kilij Arslan.

01:01:31.048 --> 01:01:32.568
I saw him there once.

01:01:45.288 --> 01:01:46.728
We are together...

01:01:48.008 --> 01:01:49.768
in this great task,

01:01:51.168 --> 01:01:53.208
for our great cause, right, Ekaterina?

01:02:00.608 --> 01:02:02.728
There's something I need you to do.

01:02:03.328 --> 01:02:04.848
You must go to the Public Market.

01:02:05.688 --> 01:02:10.288
Disguise yourself and notice
who comes and goes.

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:14.568
You must find someone called Ebu Mansur.

01:02:14.928 --> 01:02:19.048
See if that Ebu Mansur is
Sultan Alaeddin.

01:02:19.888 --> 01:02:20.808
Is he here?

01:02:21.048 --> 01:02:23.448
I hope he is, Ekaterina.

01:02:24.008 --> 01:02:27.648
If so, we'll get rid of
a lot of our troubles.

01:02:30.488 --> 01:02:33.168
Only you can do this job.

01:02:33.688 --> 01:02:36.408
And I presume
it won't prove too hard for you.

01:02:36.728 --> 01:02:38.768
Leave it to me, Vasilius.

01:02:39.368 --> 01:02:41.648
I'll do anything for revenge.

01:02:42.168 --> 01:02:43.248
Anything at all.

01:02:47.008 --> 01:02:49.128
That's what I'm afraid of, Ekaterina.

01:02:51.248 --> 01:02:53.848
Don't be like me.
Control your anger.

01:03:11.088 --> 01:03:13.408
You have yet to see
your worst fears, Vasilius.

01:03:13.928 --> 01:03:15.688
And your worst nightmare.

01:03:47.048 --> 01:03:48.128
I'm done for.

01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:50.808
I'm done for, Hafsa Hatun.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:53.128
Your wound isn't too deep, Bamsi.

01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:57.408
But maybe you should have
Artuk Bey check it.

01:03:57.608 --> 01:04:00.208
No, I don't mean that, Hafsa Hatun.

01:04:01.248 --> 01:04:03.968
It's the treacherous enemy
that disturbs me,

01:04:04.848 --> 01:04:06.888
not this small wound.

01:04:09.128 --> 01:04:10.128
I wish

01:04:10.528 --> 01:04:16.168
that disgusting Vasilius
had hurt me and not Aliyar Bey.

01:04:19.928 --> 01:04:23.688
God willing, Aliyar Bey
will return to his tribe safe and sound.

01:04:26.288 --> 01:04:30.608
God will not let Vasilius go unpunished,
with all that he's done.

01:04:33.368 --> 01:04:37.728
You will take revenge for all of us,
with Ertuğrul Bey.

01:04:39.808 --> 01:04:42.968
I hope so, Hafsa Hatun.

01:04:45.568 --> 01:04:49.568
Bamsi, you are the hope
of all those oppressed in this land.

01:04:50.848 --> 01:04:53.568
My people will be on our side, too.

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:55.808
However,

01:04:56.008 --> 01:05:01.048
we must first take
that dog's head, just like Ural.

01:05:01.928 --> 01:05:04.688
Sooner or later,
he will pay for what he did.

01:05:04.928 --> 01:05:05.888
May God

01:05:06.048 --> 01:05:09.888
let me live till the day
I see him get what he deserves.

01:05:10.968 --> 01:05:12.088
Hafsa Hatun.

01:05:16.808 --> 01:05:18.128
Amen, my love.

01:05:25.757 --> 01:05:30.757
I can see the anger in your eyes just
as I can feel your pain, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:05:32.517 --> 01:05:36.677
Vasilius used Ural to stain
the Cavdar tribe with blood.

01:05:37.797 --> 01:05:40.637
He lured many of the Turk tribes'
bravest warriors to his cause.

01:05:42.517 --> 01:05:43.717
And now, Aliyar...

01:05:44.957 --> 01:05:46.957
He must be avenged, my sultan.

01:05:48.677 --> 01:05:52.917
Taking Vasilius' head
or Karacahisar Castle

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:54.797
would not prove difficult for our army.

01:05:55.717 --> 01:05:57.077
But if I take the castle,

01:05:57.717 --> 01:06:00.837
both the Crusaders
and the emperor will get involved.

01:06:03.197 --> 01:06:05.037
As I have understood,
from my discussions

01:06:05.237 --> 01:06:08.037
with the people when I was going
by the name of Ebu Mansur,

01:06:08.517 --> 01:06:12.957
you've managed to conquer the hearts
of both Muslims and non-Muslims alike.

01:06:13.717 --> 01:06:16.997
I have upheld the duty bestowed
upon us by God, my Sultan.

01:06:17.957 --> 01:06:21.557
I have carried out
your orders for our state.

01:06:24.317 --> 01:06:28.397
I know you want to secure
the western border, my sultan.

01:06:30.157 --> 01:06:34.037
When you have gone to war,
we will carry out your orders

01:06:35.237 --> 01:06:37.437
and keep this area secure.

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:42.037
Speak frankly, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:06:43.877 --> 01:06:46.077
We're capable of taking Karacahisar Castle

01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:50.517
and sending Vasilius' head to the emperor.

01:06:51.917 --> 01:06:54.957
You need only believe in
the unity of the Turkish beys

01:06:55.957 --> 01:06:58.677
as you believe in me.

01:06:59.117 --> 01:07:02.077
You're telling me you can take
Karacahisar without an army?

01:07:03.077 --> 01:07:04.997
Not only can we take it, my sultan,

01:07:05.477 --> 01:07:09.277
we can keep the land surrounding
it secure afterwards too.

01:07:12.717 --> 01:07:15.317
I know the weaknesses
of the emperor in Nicaea.

01:07:16.557 --> 01:07:18.997
I'm also aware of the greed
of the Latins in Constantinople.

01:07:20.557 --> 01:07:23.917
Do you think you can manage to keep
the peace with only your alps?

01:07:24.517 --> 01:07:28.277
We've been training our alps
like an army for some time now.

01:07:29.317 --> 01:07:32.677
I have my best alps training them.

01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:35.797
Not a day goes by without them training.

01:07:37.037 --> 01:07:42.397
The emperor has sent his best men
to drive us from these lands.

01:07:43.237 --> 01:07:45.797
You managed to kill them all
and enter the castle.

01:07:46.397 --> 01:07:49.237
You rescued your brother Dündar
from the hands of Vasilius.

01:07:50.917 --> 01:07:55.117
More have been sent, elite soldiers.

01:07:56.437 --> 01:07:58.117
Their intention is obvious, my sultan.

01:07:58.877 --> 01:08:01.317
But I am still convinced

01:08:01.957 --> 01:08:05.557
I can take Karacahisar Castle.

01:08:51.837 --> 01:08:52.917
My brave warrior...

01:08:59.597 --> 01:09:01.637
He won't be long now.

01:09:02.837 --> 01:09:05.557
When he comes with that
beautiful face...

01:09:07.997 --> 01:09:09.917
I'll see you once again.

01:09:25.077 --> 01:09:26.637
May I come in?

01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:29.797
Of course, Mother.

01:09:36.237 --> 01:09:39.237
No, no, sit down. Sit down.

01:09:42.037 --> 01:09:44.877
I wanted to see you before I went to bed.
How are you?

01:09:45.317 --> 01:09:48.037
I'm fine, thank you, Mother.

01:09:49.597 --> 01:09:52.437
Halime Sultan has had her baby.

01:09:53.317 --> 01:09:54.997
I have everything I need.

01:09:55.397 --> 01:09:56.637
At last.

01:09:56.797 --> 01:10:00.237
Soon you too will have your baby
in your arms, God willing.

01:10:00.557 --> 01:10:05.477
Doğan's child will run around and play
with my own grandchildren one day.

01:10:06.197 --> 01:10:09.237
He'll ride horses
and wield swords, God willing.

01:10:09.917 --> 01:10:11.237
God willing, Mother.

01:10:12.357 --> 01:10:17.397
They will be alps worthy of their fathers,
and of their ancestors.

01:10:18.277 --> 01:10:19.397
God willing.

01:10:21.197 --> 01:10:23.077
I hope he'll be born soon.

01:10:24.597 --> 01:10:30.437
I want to entrust Doğan's
child to you and Ertuğrul Bey.

01:10:32.117 --> 01:10:33.877
What do you mean by that, Banu Çiçek?

01:10:34.837 --> 01:10:39.317
We set out to claim these lands
for our children, Mother Hayme.

01:10:40.477 --> 01:10:45.357
We lost so many along the way.
Doğan was martyred close to Ertuğrul Bey.

01:10:46.317 --> 01:10:47.957
Aliyar Bey fights for his life.

01:10:48.317 --> 01:10:53.917
Those who are holding swords
will consider martyrdom in this fight.

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:59.317
The motherland awaits us.
Man or woman, it doesn't matter.

01:11:02.357 --> 01:11:06.117
-Daughter, now you--
-My child is for you,

01:11:07.117 --> 01:11:08.597
my life is for God,

01:11:08.717 --> 01:11:11.237
and my sword is for Ertuğrul Bey
to look after, Mother.

01:11:14.877 --> 01:11:16.957
I don't want other mothers to cry,

01:11:17.517 --> 01:11:20.757
so until Karacahisar Castle
comes down on Vasilius

01:11:22.837 --> 01:11:24.997
I won't so much as smell my child.

01:11:30.077 --> 01:11:31.157
Look, dear...

01:11:32.557 --> 01:11:36.077
Doğan left you in our care.

01:11:36.797 --> 01:11:38.637
Doğan was my son.

01:11:39.477 --> 01:11:41.117
And you're my daughter.

01:11:41.477 --> 01:11:44.117
I think of you and Halime the same way.

01:11:47.397 --> 01:11:51.677
Ertuğrul will make Vasilius pay,
one way or another.

01:11:52.477 --> 01:11:55.477
But your duty...

01:11:57.597 --> 01:11:59.637
is to look after your child.

01:12:03.637 --> 01:12:04.917
My mother.

01:12:23.117 --> 01:12:24.237
Brother.

01:12:26.757 --> 01:12:28.877
You were away from us for so long.

01:12:31.957 --> 01:12:33.997
Even when you came home you couldn't rest.

01:12:37.197 --> 01:12:39.797
You protected me after Father died.

01:12:42.117 --> 01:12:45.357
If you go too, I won't have anybody.

01:12:50.837 --> 01:12:52.277
Please don't leave me.

01:13:05.477 --> 01:13:07.797
Artuk Bey, his hand moved!

01:13:10.237 --> 01:13:12.517
God the healer! God the healer!

01:13:16.837 --> 01:13:19.277
Aliyar Bey, can you hear me?

01:13:37.517 --> 01:13:38.557
Sister.

01:13:39.797 --> 01:13:40.837
Brother!

01:13:47.397 --> 01:13:49.117
Call Ertuğrul Bey for me.

01:13:50.397 --> 01:13:53.437
-Ishak, get Ertuğrul Bey here, quickly.
-Right away.

01:14:00.477 --> 01:14:03.517
At last. Praise God.

01:14:09.317 --> 01:14:12.397
Vasilius has spent a lot of time
fortifying the castle walls.

01:14:12.997 --> 01:14:14.237
He's preparing it for war.

01:14:14.837 --> 01:14:20.717
But all he's done is wall himself in
with the anger he feels for me.

01:14:21.917 --> 01:14:26.717
Any reputation he had among his own
people has been tarnished and lost.

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:34.357
With patience and cunning,
I can take the head of Vasilius,

01:14:34.717 --> 01:14:36.957
trapped as he is
by his own rage and folly.

01:14:38.117 --> 01:14:43.797
I'll raise our glorious flag
above the walls of Karacahisar Castle.

01:14:45.317 --> 01:14:49.797
You can leave with your army
and with your mind at ease, my sultan.

01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:52.157
May I enter?

01:14:54.437 --> 01:14:55.437
Go on.

01:15:01.037 --> 01:15:03.557
Ertuğrul Bey, do we have
your permission to enter?

01:15:05.597 --> 01:15:06.597
Come in, Mother.

01:15:12.637 --> 01:15:16.597
We wanted to show
our gratitude to Ebu Mansur.

01:15:16.997 --> 01:15:19.957
I am humbled.
We were just passing by.

01:15:21.677 --> 01:15:25.637
You saved our men. God bless you.

01:15:27.117 --> 01:15:30.437
Thank you. What are their names?

01:15:40.037 --> 01:15:41.477
My eldest son is Gündüz.

01:15:49.557 --> 01:15:51.037
We haven't named the baby yet.

01:15:52.197 --> 01:15:55.517
My father, Suleyman Shah,
wanted him to be called Savci.

01:15:56.677 --> 01:15:58.397
But I'd like you to name him.

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:03.637
I would be honored.

01:16:18.797 --> 01:16:21.797
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. <i>Allahu akbar</i>.

01:16:23.117 --> 01:16:26.037
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. <i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:16:27.117 --> 01:16:29.037
There is no god but God.

01:16:29.517 --> 01:16:31.477
There is no god but God.

01:16:32.317 --> 01:16:34.437
Muhammad is the Messenger of God.

01:16:35.317 --> 01:16:37.477
Muhammad is the Messenger of God.

01:16:38.397 --> 01:16:41.357
Hasten to the prayer.
Hasten to the prayer.

01:16:43.317 --> 01:16:46.357
Hasten to the salvation.
Hasten to the salvation.

01:16:47.557 --> 01:16:49.837
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. <i>Allahu akbar</i>.

01:16:50.797 --> 01:16:52.237
God is the only god.

01:16:56.437 --> 01:16:57.957
Your name is Savci.

01:16:59.277 --> 01:17:00.797
Your name is Savci.

01:17:02.077 --> 01:17:03.797
Your name is Savci.

01:17:10.117 --> 01:17:15.637
Your ancestor Suleyman Shah gave you
your name. God grant you a long life.

01:17:16.677 --> 01:17:17.997
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:17:18.597 --> 01:17:19.597
Amen.

01:17:20.797 --> 01:17:22.637
May the angels above...

01:17:24.117 --> 01:17:26.877
and the servants below
know that from now on...

01:17:28.357 --> 01:17:29.957
your name is Savci.

01:17:40.517 --> 01:17:43.637
-May I enter, my bey?
-Come in, Ishak.

01:17:46.677 --> 01:17:49.117
-<i>Salaam-Alaikum.</i>
-<i>Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:52.477
My bey, Aliyar Bey is awake.
He wants to see you.

01:17:54.517 --> 01:17:55.477
At last!

01:17:56.717 --> 01:17:57.717
At last.

01:18:22.957 --> 01:18:24.237
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:18:29.597 --> 01:18:30.837
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:18:32.717 --> 01:18:33.957
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:18:37.037 --> 01:18:38.357
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:18:57.277 --> 01:18:59.517
Peace of God be upon you.

01:19:03.877 --> 01:19:06.277
Peace of God be upon you.

01:19:11.357 --> 01:19:17.197
I lived as a traveler in this world.

01:19:19.117 --> 01:19:24.637
Thank God that my fate was to...

01:19:26.517 --> 01:19:31.277
be martyred fighting for his cause.

01:19:31.677 --> 01:19:32.677
Brother!

01:19:39.397 --> 01:19:40.397
Brother...

01:19:45.877 --> 01:19:47.157
Ertuğrul Bey...

01:20:00.717 --> 01:20:02.037
Aliyar Bey?

01:20:03.037 --> 01:20:04.197
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:20:07.277 --> 01:20:08.597
Come closer.

01:20:12.077 --> 01:20:15.237
Let me see you one last time.

01:20:18.197 --> 01:20:19.677
There's something I must say.

01:20:20.077 --> 01:20:21.877
Don't waste your energy, Aliyar Bey.

01:20:23.557 --> 01:20:26.237
It's time to leave this life...

01:20:28.637 --> 01:20:30.797
behind, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:20:36.317 --> 01:20:37.677
My sister and my tribe...

01:20:43.237 --> 01:20:45.157
are yours to look after.

01:20:49.197 --> 01:20:50.797
You have to take Karacahisar...

01:20:53.717 --> 01:20:56.677
and avenge our...

01:20:59.517 --> 01:21:00.997
fallen warriors.

01:21:05.877 --> 01:21:06.917
Ertuğrul Bey...

01:21:12.837 --> 01:21:14.757
Give me your blessing.

01:21:15.597 --> 01:21:16.557
Aliyar Bey...

01:21:19.197 --> 01:21:23.117
I'm so glad to have been able to fight
by the side of a warrior like you.

01:21:25.277 --> 01:21:29.557
I'll continue down our path,
never resting.

01:21:32.837 --> 01:21:36.917
Both your will and your requests
are written on my heart.

01:21:41.237 --> 01:21:42.957
But don't give up.

01:21:45.397 --> 01:21:47.557
Don't leave me alone on this journey.

01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:53.197
You'll be all right.

01:21:58.317 --> 01:21:59.917
Brother! Brother!

01:22:00.957 --> 01:22:03.637
Artuk Bey! Artuk Bey, help him!

01:22:04.397 --> 01:22:06.077
Brother, no!

01:22:20.437 --> 01:22:22.477
There is no god but God...

01:22:27.397 --> 01:22:29.637
and Muhammad is the Messenger...

01:22:32.317 --> 01:22:34.237
and the servant of God.

01:22:34.797 --> 01:22:36.477
Oh God.

01:22:42.437 --> 01:22:44.957
No! Brother, please!

01:22:47.597 --> 01:22:49.517
No! No!

01:22:51.797 --> 01:22:52.917
No!

01:25:48.997 --> 01:25:54.197
We have delivered to your peace
our warriors who died

01:25:54.677 --> 01:26:00.117
for our faith and country.
Give them peace, God.

01:26:02.197 --> 01:26:04.917
Grant your people patience, God.

01:26:05.517 --> 01:26:09.197
Heal our wounded quickly, God.

01:26:09.917 --> 01:26:14.797
Deliver us from all kinds of enemies,
within or beyond,

01:26:15.317 --> 01:26:21.797
who would disturb our faith,
state and nation.

01:26:24.877 --> 01:26:28.197
Grant victory to our noble resistance

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:34.517
as it fights for justice
and righteousness, God.

01:26:36.117 --> 01:26:40.197
For the sake of our martyrs

01:26:40.637 --> 01:26:42.757
please accept our prayers.

01:26:43.477 --> 01:26:47.517
Grant them safe passage to heaven, God.

01:26:50.717 --> 01:26:52.437
You grant justice.

01:26:54.477 --> 01:26:56.557
You are the all-powerful.

01:26:58.037 --> 01:27:00.077
Amen. Amen.

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:07.717
<i>Ve selamun alel murselin</i>
<i>velhamdulillahi rabbil alemin.</i>

01:27:08.397 --> 01:27:09.597
<i>Al Fatiha.</i>

01:27:36.397 --> 01:27:37.637
<i>Salaam-Alaikum</i>, sir.

01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:40.117
<i>Alaikum-Salaam</i>.

01:27:42.197 --> 01:27:43.877
Ertuğrul Bey awaits you.

01:27:46.757 --> 01:27:47.957
Let's go, Abdurrahman.

01:27:50.117 --> 01:27:53.037
Let us carry out our last
duty to our martyrs.

01:28:08.437 --> 01:28:09.437
Mother.

01:28:12.117 --> 01:28:13.157
I'll come too.

01:28:13.557 --> 01:28:16.437
-Daughter.
-I must be there for Aslıhan.

01:28:26.597 --> 01:28:27.717
Brother.

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:37.237
You were my life.

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:42.037
You were more than my life.

01:28:48.717 --> 01:28:50.917
My brave brother.

01:30:08.317 --> 01:30:10.357
Avenge my brother, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:30:14.477 --> 01:30:18.037
The alps of my tribe
are at your command.

01:30:19.877 --> 01:30:21.197
As am I.

01:30:23.237 --> 01:30:28.637
I swear that I will drown Vasilius
in the blood of our martyrs.

01:30:34.717 --> 01:30:36.957
Look after the Cavdar tribe,
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:30:38.397 --> 01:30:39.677
Stay strong.

01:30:42.397 --> 01:30:48.317
Stay strong so that the people
and the alps can share in your strength.

01:30:53.477 --> 01:30:54.477
Now...

01:30:57.957 --> 01:31:02.997
it's time to unite to carry out
Aliyar Bey's final wishes.

01:31:18.957 --> 01:31:20.077
Brother.

01:32:36.837 --> 01:32:37.917
Aliyar Bey...

01:32:39.597 --> 01:32:41.677
is with God, my sultan.

01:32:48.077 --> 01:32:49.357
May he rest in peace.

01:32:50.597 --> 01:32:51.597
Amen.

01:32:53.397 --> 01:32:57.157
You didn't hesitate to risk
your lives for my state.

01:32:58.717 --> 01:33:00.357
You lost many.

01:33:01.157 --> 01:33:04.477
Aliyar Bey has also
been martyred for my state.

01:33:05.277 --> 01:33:09.437
I must avenge him, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:33:11.917 --> 01:33:17.517
The emperor is the snake
and Vasilius is its venom.

01:33:19.517 --> 01:33:21.797
The head of the snake must be cut off.

01:33:23.717 --> 01:33:27.117
We would gladly sacrifice our lives
for our state, my sultan.

01:33:28.797 --> 01:33:31.637
Your words and what I have seen of you,

01:33:32.117 --> 01:33:34.717
what I know of your deeds in these lands,

01:33:35.237 --> 01:33:37.117
have already convinced me, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:33:39.117 --> 01:33:41.757
You succeeded in uniting
the Turk tribes.

01:33:42.597 --> 01:33:45.997
This united force must
now take Karacahisar.

01:33:51.837 --> 01:33:54.517
Call a council before I return to Konya.

01:33:54.997 --> 01:34:00.037
I want to see the beys myself
so that I may declare you their leader.

01:34:05.717 --> 01:34:08.237
I know that you will avenge our martyrs.

01:34:12.357 --> 01:34:16.837
When Karacahisar is conquered,
I will grant you these lands.

01:34:18.717 --> 01:34:22.317
The territory of the glorious Kayi
will be a land of justice

01:34:22.677 --> 01:34:25.557
for Turk tribes and non-Muslims alike.

01:34:26.797 --> 01:34:30.157
May God not give you shame
in this endeavor.

01:34:32.157 --> 01:34:33.157
Amen.

01:34:36.997 --> 01:34:41.157
The Quran will be our guide,
Alaeddin Keykubat Khan, our sultan,

01:34:41.757 --> 01:34:47.117
and Oghuz Han, our ancestor.
May Allah help and protect us.

01:34:48.597 --> 01:34:52.357
Our lives are lived for your state.

01:34:55.317 --> 01:35:00.357
May God not give us shame
before our martyrs.

01:35:09.117 --> 01:35:12.517
Ertuğrul , Aliyar, Aslıhan.

01:35:13.237 --> 01:35:15.637
Let me see the day they all die, God.

01:35:16.077 --> 01:35:19.837
Let me accomplish my final duty
in this castle in which I'm entombed.

01:35:20.557 --> 01:35:22.997
Let me kill that dog, Vasilius.

01:35:23.477 --> 01:35:26.037
May my hands be covered
with his dirty blood.

01:35:26.437 --> 01:35:29.757
After that, even hell will be
heaven for me.

01:37:04.717 --> 01:37:07.397
-<i>Salaam-Alaikum</i>.
-<i>Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

01:37:07.557 --> 01:37:08.677
<i>Alaikum-Salaam</i>.

01:37:24.477 --> 01:37:26.797
<i>Al Fatiha</i>, for the soul of our martyr.

01:37:56.757 --> 01:37:58.957
I seek refuge in God from
the cursed Satan.

01:37:59.197 --> 01:38:00.717
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:38:01.477 --> 01:38:04.437
Our prophet says that

01:38:04.637 --> 01:38:08.717
seeing the angel of death is worse than
being pierced by a thousand swords.

01:38:10.877 --> 01:38:13.077
But there is no death for believers.

01:38:14.077 --> 01:38:17.957
Death is merely a migration for them.

01:38:18.957 --> 01:38:25.277
And when a believer is martyred
he will not be questioned.

01:38:32.317 --> 01:38:34.997
We all knew Aliyar Bey when he was alive.

01:38:35.717 --> 01:38:39.477
We are all witness to the fact that
he was a good Muslim and a fair Bey.

01:38:40.677 --> 01:38:42.557
May God grant us martyrdom,

01:38:43.077 --> 01:38:46.837
may he allow us to
give our lives for him.

01:38:46.997 --> 01:38:47.957
Amen.

01:38:48.317 --> 01:38:49.637
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:38:50.717 --> 01:38:54.197
If a land is to be a motherland,
it needs sacrifice.

01:38:55.717 --> 01:39:00.157
Our sacrifice is the blood
of our many martyrs.

01:39:01.757 --> 01:39:06.517
God, do not let the descendants
of the martyrs who settled here

01:39:06.837 --> 01:39:08.437
leave your path.

01:39:08.557 --> 01:39:10.397
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:39:10.957 --> 01:39:12.197
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:39:12.397 --> 01:39:13.317
Amen.

01:39:15.237 --> 01:39:20.877
Make our descendants responsible,
and make them good Muslims.

01:39:21.397 --> 01:39:22.237
Amen.

01:39:22.677 --> 01:39:24.157
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:39:54.797 --> 01:39:56.277
I'm ready to go.

01:40:17.477 --> 01:40:21.157
You were wasted on the Turks, Ekaterina.

01:40:22.557 --> 01:40:24.997
I'll be whoever I want to be.

01:40:25.837 --> 01:40:27.317
I'm doing what's necessary.

01:40:28.037 --> 01:40:29.317
You're doing even more.

01:40:29.957 --> 01:40:32.477
You're going to find out
who Ebu Mansur is.

01:40:32.837 --> 01:40:34.077
And if he's Alaeddin?

01:40:34.637 --> 01:40:38.117
Then we'll have a treasure.

01:40:42.597 --> 01:40:44.117
-Sir.
-Speak.

01:40:44.557 --> 01:40:46.117
I have news that you should hear.

01:40:46.917 --> 01:40:47.917
Speak!

01:40:48.677 --> 01:40:53.357
Our scouts say a convoy left
the Kayi tribe for the Cavdar tribe.

01:40:53.477 --> 01:40:55.437
They're transporting a coffin on a cart.

01:41:05.117 --> 01:41:07.237
I told you he wouldn't live long.

01:41:08.517 --> 01:41:10.917
May you suffer, Aliyar.

01:41:11.797 --> 01:41:15.877
This is only a fraction of the pain
we're going to make them feel, Ekaterina.

01:41:15.997 --> 01:41:17.117
A fraction.

01:41:17.917 --> 01:41:21.677
I won't stop until there's nobody
left to mourn them.

01:41:23.077 --> 01:41:28.757
That cart will not stay empty.
One will die before another is mourned.

01:41:29.557 --> 01:41:33.357
-You're so--
-So angry, Vasilius.

01:41:34.157 --> 01:41:37.757
I refuse to show mercy
to anyone who has hurt me.

01:41:48.597 --> 01:41:50.397
Get on with it, then.

01:42:00.837 --> 01:42:05.917
<i>Allahu akbar</i>.
There is no god but God.

01:42:06.157 --> 01:42:10.917
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

01:42:11.397 --> 01:42:15.957
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

01:42:16.197 --> 01:42:20.677
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

01:42:21.197 --> 01:42:25.717
<i>Allahu akbar.</i> There is no god but God.

01:42:26.037 --> 01:42:31.037
<i>Allahu akbar.</i> There is no god but God.

01:42:31.357 --> 01:42:36.037
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

01:42:36.437 --> 01:42:41.237
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

01:42:41.637 --> 01:42:46.157
<i>Allahu akbar.</i> There is no god but God.

01:42:46.917 --> 01:42:51.517
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

01:42:51.757 --> 01:42:56.597
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

01:42:56.877 --> 01:43:01.677
<i>Allahu akbar.</i> There is no god but God.

01:43:01.877 --> 01:43:06.477
<i>Allahu akbar</i>. There is no god but God.

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:38.437
Welcome, emir.

01:44:39.877 --> 01:44:41.237
Where is Ertuğrul Bey?

01:44:41.997 --> 01:44:43.357
Aliyar Bey has died.

01:44:44.477 --> 01:44:46.317
They went to the Cavdar tribe to bury him.

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:51.677
{\an8}We're going to the Cavdar tribe.

01:44:57.303 --> 01:45:02.423
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

01:45:02.743 --> 01:45:07.543
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

01:45:07.663 --> 01:45:12.663
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

01:45:27.943 --> 01:45:32.823
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

01:45:43.263 --> 01:45:48.103
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

01:45:58.583 --> 01:46:03.543
God is great. God is great.
There is no god but God.

01:46:04.503 --> 01:46:06.343
May you rest in heaven.

01:46:06.423 --> 01:46:10.303
-We won't forget him.
-Rest in peace.

01:46:14.783 --> 01:46:17.303
Rest in peace, Aliyar Bey,
rest in peace, Aliyar Bey.

01:46:17.423 --> 01:46:19.023
God bless you.

01:46:40.481 --> 01:46:44.601
Honorable men, women and warriors

01:46:46.001 --> 01:46:48.561
of the Cavdar tribe.

01:46:51.521 --> 01:46:52.601
Aliyar Bey

01:46:54.161 --> 01:46:57.881
led his life honorably,

01:46:59.641 --> 01:47:03.161
for his faith, integrity and tribe.

01:47:03.961 --> 01:47:06.521
He did not hesitate to give his life...

01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:10.441
as a brave warrior should.

01:47:14.601 --> 01:47:18.121
He has left behind much wisdom

01:47:19.121 --> 01:47:23.761
which will illuminate your path.

01:47:27.561 --> 01:47:29.201
It is yours now.

01:47:32.481 --> 01:47:33.761
Do not forget him.

01:47:35.241 --> 01:47:39.001
It's up to you to keep his memory alive.

01:47:40.521 --> 01:47:41.521
Remember him.

01:47:45.961 --> 01:47:47.281
Do not tarnish his memory.

01:48:05.241 --> 01:48:08.801
He was your Bey and my brother.

01:48:10.601 --> 01:48:13.601
A mother, a father.

01:48:15.161 --> 01:48:19.401
He was a great man who would
shoulder any burden asked of him.

01:48:22.761 --> 01:48:25.361
My brother has done
his work in this world.

01:48:27.161 --> 01:48:29.041
And he now rests in peace.

01:48:32.521 --> 01:48:35.081
It is our duty to continue that work.

01:48:36.521 --> 01:48:37.961
We will stand tall.

01:48:39.001 --> 01:48:44.921
We will protect our tribe, our honor
and our traditions as he would have done.

01:48:46.401 --> 01:48:51.881
Our mourning will be short
but our pain will never fade.

01:48:56.121 --> 01:49:00.521
Let it be known that our tribe
will not remain leaderless.

01:49:01.401 --> 01:49:07.801
Until a new Bey is elected,
I will uphold my brother's legacy.

01:49:30.801 --> 01:49:33.801
We came from God
and we will return to him.

01:50:26.681 --> 01:50:27.641
Yes?

01:50:29.841 --> 01:50:33.521
Sir, Ekaterina managed
to get a message to our soldiers.

01:50:35.001 --> 01:50:36.401
Tell me.

01:50:36.761 --> 01:50:40.641
Emir Sadettin was at Hanli bazaar.
But he left quickly.

01:50:42.641 --> 01:50:44.121
Emir Sadettin?

01:50:48.481 --> 01:50:51.801
So you came, Emir Sadettin.

01:50:52.601 --> 01:50:54.881
We're not quite done with you yet.

01:50:57.321 --> 01:51:00.401
They've made their intentions
obvious by coming one by one.

01:51:01.761 --> 01:51:02.721
War.

01:51:05.201 --> 01:51:07.761
I'll give you a most bloody war.

01:52:24.681 --> 01:52:25.841
My condolences.

01:52:26.281 --> 01:52:28.081
-Thank you, Emir.
-Thank you, Emir.

01:52:28.161 --> 01:52:29.401
My condolences.

01:52:33.961 --> 01:52:35.561
God bless you, Emir.

01:53:21.881 --> 01:53:24.641
I seek refuge in God
from the cursed Satan.

01:53:26.921 --> 01:53:28.721
In the name of God.

01:53:30.081 --> 01:53:31.481
To the prayers for God.

01:53:32.241 --> 01:53:34.201
To witness his Messenger.

01:53:35.001 --> 01:53:38.481
To pray for the deceased.

01:53:40.401 --> 01:53:41.721
God is great.

01:53:54.401 --> 01:53:55.961
God is great.

01:54:08.641 --> 01:54:10.001
God is great.

01:54:23.081 --> 01:54:24.521
God is great.

01:54:25.921 --> 01:54:28.401
Peace of God be upon you.

01:54:29.241 --> 01:54:32.001
Peace of God be upon you.

01:54:40.081 --> 01:54:42.921
Did you give your blessings to Aliyar Bey?

01:54:43.041 --> 01:54:44.881
Bless him!

01:54:47.561 --> 01:54:48.521
Did you?

01:54:48.961 --> 01:54:50.201
Bless him!

01:54:50.841 --> 01:54:51.801
Did you?

01:54:52.241 --> 01:54:53.481
Bless him!

01:54:55.481 --> 01:54:58.521
-And God bless you.
-Amen.

01:56:40.361 --> 01:56:42.241
Mother, where is my brother?

01:56:42.561 --> 01:56:45.001
He's asleep, Gunduz, be quiet.

01:56:53.201 --> 01:56:55.041
The baby looks nothing like me.

01:56:56.241 --> 01:56:58.001
Dear boy, come here.

01:56:59.801 --> 01:57:04.121
You looked like that too when you
were a baby. Then you grew up.

01:57:04.321 --> 01:57:08.881
You became a big brother.
He's only a baby right now.

01:57:09.881 --> 01:57:12.921
You've to look after
your brother from now on.

01:57:13.081 --> 01:57:17.161
I'm training the alps,
I can't look after him.

01:57:18.281 --> 01:57:22.761
You're right, I know.
And you're training them really well.

01:57:23.561 --> 01:57:25.961
Put your brother among the alps too,

01:57:26.241 --> 01:57:29.201
so that you can both serve
in the ranks of your father.

01:57:29.601 --> 01:57:31.761
As long as he swears fealty to me.

01:57:33.361 --> 01:57:36.361
Come here. My little bey.

01:57:39.401 --> 01:57:41.001
Son of the bey of the beys.

01:58:08.041 --> 01:58:09.321
Uncle Alaeddin?

01:58:31.241 --> 01:58:32.281
Halime Hatun?

01:58:33.601 --> 01:58:37.521
Are you well?
You were far away, what happened?

01:58:37.601 --> 01:58:39.001
No, I'm fine.

01:58:40.241 --> 01:58:41.721
I just remembered something.

01:58:44.161 --> 01:58:45.201
You're tired.

01:58:46.001 --> 01:58:48.001
Go and rest. I'll look after the baby.

01:58:49.361 --> 01:58:52.521
Thank you, Hafsa.
But I'm fine, don't worry.

01:59:30.561 --> 01:59:32.121
He loved to learn.

01:59:34.081 --> 01:59:36.841
He didn't see mother or father.

01:59:41.921 --> 01:59:45.401
Only knowledge. Only school.

01:59:48.041 --> 01:59:49.961
He spent most of his life far away.

01:59:52.281 --> 01:59:54.361
When he came back home,

01:59:56.081 --> 01:59:59.641
he left this world quickly.

02:00:05.041 --> 02:00:11.321
Daughter, we all came from God
and we'll all return to him.

02:00:13.401 --> 02:00:18.361
Aliyar Bey went straight to heaven,
according to Islamic ethics.

02:00:19.201 --> 02:00:20.841
No doubt about that, Mother Hayme.

02:00:24.281 --> 02:00:28.601
I'll walk in his footsteps from now on.

02:00:30.081 --> 02:00:32.241
I'll look after his legacy.

02:00:33.281 --> 02:00:35.841
I'll stand tall at the head of my tribe.

02:00:37.801 --> 02:00:43.161
His friends are my friends,
his enemies are my enemies.

02:00:45.041 --> 02:00:46.961
That's my daughter.

02:00:49.201 --> 02:00:50.921
We'll always support you.

02:00:52.201 --> 02:00:55.201
Ertugrul is your brother too, from now on.

02:00:57.281 --> 02:00:59.761
And Halime your sister.

02:01:02.641 --> 02:01:04.161
If you agree...

02:01:06.601 --> 02:01:08.681
please think of me
as your mother, daughter.

02:01:12.921 --> 02:01:16.241
My sweet daughter. My sweet daughter.

02:01:18.121 --> 02:01:19.881
God bless you.

02:01:22.961 --> 02:01:24.521
Don't ever leave us, Mother.

02:01:31.161 --> 02:01:34.721
The day I met Aliyar Bey,

02:01:35.081 --> 02:01:37.641
I saw what a big heart he had.

02:01:40.761 --> 02:01:44.481
Ertugrul Bey managed
to unite the Turk tribes,

02:01:44.961 --> 02:01:47.761
thanks to Aliyar Bey.

02:01:48.761 --> 02:01:50.361
May he rest in peace.

02:01:53.561 --> 02:01:55.521
I know I'm not alone

02:01:56.241 --> 02:01:58.601
thanks to you and Ertugrul Bey.

02:02:00.241 --> 02:02:03.721
My tribe and our honor are yours.

02:02:05.201 --> 02:02:06.361
May I come in?

02:02:09.361 --> 02:02:11.241
Please come in, Emir.

02:02:27.961 --> 02:02:32.601
I'm so sorry for your loss, dear.
I'll leave you alone.

02:02:34.721 --> 02:02:36.241
Please do.

02:02:39.761 --> 02:02:40.881
Hayme Hatun.

02:02:59.561 --> 02:03:00.921
<i>Bismillah</i>.

02:03:02.081 --> 02:03:04.401
Sit down, Aslihan. Sit down.

02:03:10.481 --> 02:03:14.041
My condolences.
May God grant you patience.

02:03:18.361 --> 02:03:23.481
Even through all this pain,
you still manage to stand tall.

02:03:23.961 --> 02:03:26.041
This is a great comfort to me.

02:03:28.241 --> 02:03:31.401
The way you conducted yourself
when that traitor Ural returned

02:03:31.881 --> 02:03:35.201
showed me how brave you are, but I
saw today how strong you are too.

02:03:37.241 --> 02:03:40.361
Ural is where he belongs, Emir.

02:03:41.401 --> 02:03:46.121
As for Aliyar Bey,
he gave his authority of the tribe to me.

02:03:49.001 --> 02:03:50.561
Of course, of course.

02:03:52.321 --> 02:03:58.481
You should perform this duty
until the council elects a new Bey.

02:04:01.521 --> 02:04:05.761
I don't intend to abandon my tribe
after the council has voted.

02:04:08.201 --> 02:04:11.121
The Cavdar tribe will always be my home.

02:04:15.921 --> 02:04:18.121
Do you realise
what you're saying, Aslihan?

02:04:22.481 --> 02:04:23.801
I do, Emir.

02:04:25.921 --> 02:04:28.041
When I agreed to be your wife

02:04:28.521 --> 02:04:32.081
to satisfy my father's wishes,
I had two brothers.

02:04:32.801 --> 02:04:33.801
I trusted them.

02:04:36.121 --> 02:04:38.761
Now one is martyred, the other killed.

02:04:40.081 --> 02:04:44.481
I won't leave my tribe until
my brother is avenged.

02:04:45.281 --> 02:04:48.041
Know that I would die for my tribe too.

02:04:56.041 --> 02:04:58.921
Pain has dulled your senses,
Aslihan Hatun.

02:05:01.041 --> 02:05:07.601
You promised to be my wife
and dedicate your life to me.

02:05:08.241 --> 02:05:11.881
You promised. Remember that.

02:05:15.121 --> 02:05:20.121
Forgive me, Emir. My decision is final.

02:05:26.321 --> 02:05:31.801
What makes you think you, a woman,
is capable of leading your tribe?

02:05:34.681 --> 02:05:40.761
If Mother Hayme has done it before,
so I am capable of doing it now.

02:05:43.081 --> 02:05:45.561
And I will have Ertugrul Bey by my side.

02:05:47.721 --> 02:05:48.841
Ertugrul.

02:05:51.201 --> 02:05:52.241
Ertugrul.

02:05:58.441 --> 02:05:59.361
Ertugrul?

02:06:03.881 --> 02:06:05.161
My decision is final.

02:06:06.801 --> 02:06:12.601
A glorious Emir like you will easily find
a more suitable woman than me.

02:06:14.201 --> 02:06:18.481
Now, if you'll allow me,
I'd like to mourn my brother in peace,

02:06:19.321 --> 02:06:21.641
at least for a day.

02:06:25.161 --> 02:06:30.521
It is my priority now to discuss
with Ertugrul Bey by what means

02:06:31.601 --> 02:06:33.441
he and I can avenge my brother.

02:06:37.401 --> 02:06:40.441
I know you are speaking out of grief.

02:06:42.641 --> 02:06:45.241
The pain will lessen with time.

02:06:47.761 --> 02:06:49.761
You'll see the mistake you've made.

02:06:56.881 --> 02:06:58.321
I'll wait for you, Aslihan.

02:07:01.721 --> 02:07:06.121
No matter how long it takes. I'll wait.

02:07:11.521 --> 02:07:12.801
You'll see.

02:07:19.721 --> 02:07:21.041
Excuse me.

02:08:04.441 --> 02:08:06.681
If Ebu Mansur really is Sultan Alaeddin,

02:08:07.321 --> 02:08:10.801
you can see now how Ekaterina
could change the fate of our country,

02:08:10.961 --> 02:08:12.921
can't you Nikolas?

02:08:13.601 --> 02:08:15.241
I don't doubt it.

02:08:15.978 --> 02:08:19.681
Ekaterina is capable of securing
you a great victory.

02:08:20.721 --> 02:08:23.321
I'm so pleased Ekaterina
has found the right path.

02:08:24.641 --> 02:08:27.041
You revived a woman left without hope.

02:08:31.121 --> 02:08:33.921
Her only mistake was believing in a Turk.

02:08:34.521 --> 02:08:36.641
She has found the holy path now.

02:08:36.961 --> 02:08:38.241
Smart woman.

02:08:39.041 --> 02:08:42.721
Smart women can be dangerous.

02:08:44.361 --> 02:08:48.441
I know that only too well, Nikolas.
Only too well.

02:08:49.681 --> 02:08:51.601
That's why I keep her close.

02:08:52.201 --> 02:08:55.321
You could keep her closer.

02:08:56.121 --> 02:09:01.241
She's of noble birth.
When the day comes, she'd be worthy

02:09:01.441 --> 02:09:03.801
of a governor set to become emperor.

02:09:35.401 --> 02:09:37.521
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

02:09:37.641 --> 02:09:39.321
Greetings, brothers.

02:09:48.161 --> 02:09:49.841
I'm sorry for your loss, brother.

02:09:50.321 --> 02:09:51.721
Sorry for your loss, brothers.

02:09:51.841 --> 02:09:54.921
-Thank you.
-Thank you both.

02:09:55.161 --> 02:09:56.201
Come, sit.

02:09:57.201 --> 02:09:58.241
Brothers.

02:10:06.681 --> 02:10:10.441
Candar Bey is gone.
The dog Ural Bey is also gone.

02:10:11.041 --> 02:10:12.281
Our beys lie slaughtered.

02:10:13.521 --> 02:10:15.281
Now, we are alone.

02:10:17.681 --> 02:10:19.801
The great Cavdar tribe is leaderless.

02:10:20.441 --> 02:10:22.441
It'll be very hard for us to regroup.

02:10:25.721 --> 02:10:26.641
Brother...

02:10:27.961 --> 02:10:29.121
Brothers...

02:10:29.801 --> 02:10:31.241
We are as one.

02:10:32.881 --> 02:10:35.481
Aliyar Bey was our bey as well.

02:10:37.841 --> 02:10:41.961
Ertugrul Bey is our bey. Don't lose hope.

02:10:42.161 --> 02:10:43.881
It's more complicated
than that, Bamsi Alp.

02:10:44.641 --> 02:10:46.961
The bey of a tribe is its everything.

02:10:47.681 --> 02:10:49.441
A beyless tribe cannot be.

02:11:04.081 --> 02:11:07.321
-Greetings, Alps.
-Greetings.

02:11:07.561 --> 02:11:09.041
Sir, you honor us.

02:11:09.921 --> 02:11:10.761
Please.

02:11:27.921 --> 02:11:32.121
Death brings joy to the deceased,
but pain to those left behind.

02:11:34.801 --> 02:11:38.761
However, there should be
no sadness for martyrs.

02:11:39.281 --> 02:11:43.681
Sir, we purged out tribe of traitors
and we stood united,

02:11:43.881 --> 02:11:45.361
we had peace.

02:11:46.241 --> 02:11:48.721
But now our bey and leader is gone.

02:11:49.801 --> 02:11:51.361
What do we do now?

02:11:55.401 --> 02:11:56.401
My children...

02:11:59.761 --> 02:12:01.921
All this wasn't created in a day.

02:12:03.441 --> 02:12:05.721
A great cause requires great sacrifice.

02:12:06.681 --> 02:12:08.521
In the first years of Islam

02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:12.761
we lost many of our leaders.

02:12:14.761 --> 02:12:19.681
The Battles of Badr and Uhud,
and the Battle of the Trench.

02:12:21.281 --> 02:12:23.841
Many people like Hamza,

02:12:24.481 --> 02:12:29.041
Ja’far ibn Abi Talib, Ammar ibn Yasir,
and Yasir ibn Amir

02:12:29.481 --> 02:12:31.801
were martyred for the cause.

02:12:33.481 --> 02:12:35.921
War and death never ceased.

02:12:37.281 --> 02:12:40.761
You have accepted the jihad for God

02:12:43.041 --> 02:12:45.721
as a pillar of Islam.

02:12:46.481 --> 02:12:50.401
But, do not forget this.

02:12:53.121 --> 02:12:56.081
The distance the arrow travels
depends on how far it is pulled back.

02:12:57.001 --> 02:12:59.401
Every time the enemy attacks you

02:13:00.201 --> 02:13:02.441
and causes you pain,

02:13:03.041 --> 02:13:05.801
you become stronger.

02:13:09.121 --> 02:13:14.121
Our Prophet, peace be upon him,

02:13:15.121 --> 02:13:17.161
when he passed away,

02:13:18.521 --> 02:13:20.801
some Muslims lost hope.

02:13:24.281 --> 02:13:27.001
Asap couldn't believe he had died,

02:13:28.001 --> 02:13:30.281
he couldn't take on the responsibility.

02:13:30.801 --> 02:13:33.161
But the cause of God had to go on,

02:13:34.161 --> 02:13:36.481
the banner of Islam
still had to be carried.

02:13:37.561 --> 02:13:42.721
So, Abu Bakr went to our prophet,

02:13:43.761 --> 02:13:47.641
covered his face,
and faced the companions.

02:13:48.881 --> 02:13:50.801
Abu Bakr said that,

02:13:51.641 --> 02:13:56.561
whoever believes in Muhammad,
peace be upon him,

02:13:57.441 --> 02:14:00.241
know that he's in heaven.

02:14:04.441 --> 02:14:07.601
Whoever prays to and serves God,

02:14:08.441 --> 02:14:11.281
know that God is immortal.

02:14:13.521 --> 02:14:17.121
Then he recited these verses from
the <i>surah Ali Imran</i>.

02:14:19.401 --> 02:14:22.201
"Muhammad is but a messenger.

02:14:24.481 --> 02:14:27.241
Other messengers have
passed on before him.

02:14:28.721 --> 02:14:31.601
So if he was to die or be killed...

02:14:33.361 --> 02:14:36.601
would you turn back
and no longer believe?

02:14:39.441 --> 02:14:41.521
He who turns back...

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:44.881
cannot harm God.

02:14:46.641 --> 02:14:49.361
But God will reward the grateful."

02:14:50.721 --> 02:14:56.081
Ashap was shaken by these words
and they regained hope.

02:14:57.201 --> 02:14:59.721
They adopted the cause of Islam.

02:15:00.601 --> 02:15:04.441
So Islam was spread throughout the world.

02:15:05.241 --> 02:15:09.041
Gave hope to innocents, fear to tyrants.

02:15:10.481 --> 02:15:13.601
Holy God has said in the<i> surah Ali Imran,</i>

02:15:14.441 --> 02:15:16.121
"So, do not weaken.

02:15:16.881 --> 02:15:18.281
Do not grieve.

02:15:19.601 --> 02:15:23.681
And you will be superior
if you are true believers."

02:15:25.881 --> 02:15:28.321
We need brave men like Ali

02:15:29.081 --> 02:15:33.761
and those who will uphold his legacy,
like Hussein.

02:15:35.361 --> 02:15:36.881
The <i>Ummah </i>awaits salvation.

02:15:37.521 --> 02:15:39.441
Humanity awaits service.

02:15:40.801 --> 02:15:45.641
Now, you must fight for tomorrow.

02:15:48.401 --> 02:15:51.361
Yesterday you were led by Aliyar Bey.

02:15:51.801 --> 02:15:54.281
Today, by Ertugrul Bey.

02:15:56.721 --> 02:15:58.281
Now, you must...

02:15:59.721 --> 02:16:02.521
keep the cause of your Bey alive,

02:16:03.241 --> 02:16:07.161
unite and follow the path of the union.

02:16:43.601 --> 02:16:45.321
Mother, welcome.

02:16:46.081 --> 02:16:47.361
Thank you, dear.

02:16:49.561 --> 02:16:52.641
Is he asleep? God bless him.

02:17:07.961 --> 02:17:10.881
We carried out our last duty.

02:17:15.001 --> 02:17:17.081
Aliyar was like a son to me.

02:17:18.601 --> 02:17:22.961
Seeing him with Ertugrul
used to make me so happy.

02:17:24.481 --> 02:17:28.721
He was a brother to Ertugrul
and a son to me.

02:17:32.281 --> 02:17:34.361
Death only brings joy
to the martyr, Mother.

02:17:36.241 --> 02:17:38.961
But it's hard on the ones left behind.

02:17:39.841 --> 02:17:43.881
This sad heart has said
goodbye to many warriors.

02:17:45.481 --> 02:17:46.801
Now I realize that...

02:17:48.041 --> 02:17:50.521
Aliyar had a special place in my heart.

02:17:53.321 --> 02:17:55.081
Death is inevitable.

02:17:56.961 --> 02:17:59.161
Aliyar Bey was blessed with martyrdom.

02:18:00.481 --> 02:18:03.281
You're right, dear. You're right.

02:18:06.561 --> 02:18:10.441
-May God grant him rest.
-Amen.

02:18:13.401 --> 02:18:16.481
Mother, was Ebu Mansur at the funeral?

02:18:16.681 --> 02:18:17.881
He was, dear.

02:18:18.681 --> 02:18:21.641
Ertugrul never left his side.

02:18:26.721 --> 02:18:28.561
Do you still doubt him?

02:18:31.121 --> 02:18:34.521
Mother, this Ebu Mansur is no
ordinary merchant.

02:18:37.841 --> 02:18:39.721
I've remembered who he is.

02:18:41.721 --> 02:18:42.681
Who is he?

02:18:44.601 --> 02:18:45.681
Sultan Alaeddin.

02:18:54.521 --> 02:18:56.641
Do you know what you're saying, Halime?

02:18:58.481 --> 02:19:01.041
-Are you sure?
-Yes, Mother, I'm sure.

02:19:02.001 --> 02:19:05.081
I saw Uncle Alaeddin
before he became Sultan.

02:19:05.761 --> 02:19:07.001
That's how I know.

02:19:31.921 --> 02:19:34.001
Were you expecting Emir Sadettin,
my Sultan?

02:19:34.401 --> 02:19:35.321
No.

02:19:37.201 --> 02:19:38.761
But it's good he's here.

02:19:39.641 --> 02:19:42.121
He should know of my decision
concerning your new duty.

02:19:43.841 --> 02:19:47.321
When I return, I'll leave
Sadettin here to support you.

02:20:04.161 --> 02:20:05.081
My Sultan.

02:20:12.201 --> 02:20:14.241
What brings you here, Sadettin?

02:20:16.921 --> 02:20:19.521
My marriage to Aslihan Hatun, my Sultan.

02:20:20.841 --> 02:20:25.921
But her father's death,
and now Aliyar Bey...

02:20:27.481 --> 02:20:28.881
It's good that you're here.

02:20:30.241 --> 02:20:32.521
That you came in time
for Aliyar Bey's funeral.

02:20:36.121 --> 02:20:40.281
Also, after talking over some
matters with Ertugrul Bey,

02:20:40.401 --> 02:20:42.201
I've come to a decision.

02:20:45.401 --> 02:20:47.041
A decision you should be told about.

02:20:51.121 --> 02:20:53.321
I hope it's good news, my Sultan.

02:20:55.641 --> 02:20:59.921
Ertugrul Bey is now
the chief Bey of my state.

02:21:05.221 --> 02:21:07.461
He will govern these lands.

02:21:16.261 --> 02:21:20.381
It's an honor for me to serve
my state and nation, my Sultan.
