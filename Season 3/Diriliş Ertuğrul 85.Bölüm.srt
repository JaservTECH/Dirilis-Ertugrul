1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 85 will start after 12:30 min.

2
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,672
They welcome us.

3
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:30,392
We will respond
in the language they understand.

4
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:33,152
Where is Commander Angelos?

5
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:43,312
Who are you?

6
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,032
Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

7
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,592
God is life!

8
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:24,192
Dumrul, take us to the dungeon!

9
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:25,952
Turgut!

10
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:29,192
Come with me.

11
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:30,712
Abdurrahman, come with me.

12
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:37,152
Aliyar, the courtyard is yours.

13
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:14,552
Aliyar Bey!

14
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:24,352
God is life!

15
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:01,472
Stake out the area.

16
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,312
Make sure it's safe.

17
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,632
Go.

18
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:30,032
Now is the time, Bamsı.

19
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:31,352
Let's attack.

20
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,152
Cihan...

21
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,752
which of you...

22
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:37,992
Which of you burns up inside like me?

23
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:40,232
We'll wait.

24
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:43,752
We'll wait, brother.

25
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:47,432
Let them spread out like cattle...

26
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:50,032
then we'll hunt them
while they're off guard.

27
00:17:12,472 --> 00:17:13,912
I'll save you, Helena.

28
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:17,152
I'll save you from them.

29
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:20,272
Archers to the wall.

30
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,872
Don't let any of them into the courtyard.

31
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:24,552
Come on my brave men.

32
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:27,232
We'll make hell of this courtyard.

33
00:17:27,592 --> 00:17:30,512
-God is great!
-God is great!

34
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:34,312
God is great!

35
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:04,992
Which way, Dumrul?

36
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:09,592
Didn't you memorize the way?

37
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:13,072
I saw some drunken soldiers
and they taught me the way, my bey.

38
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:14,832
We go this way.

39
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:15,912
Good.

40
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:20,432
Come on now.

41
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:23,752
Come and we'll see how thick your neck is.

42
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:49,952
What's that noise?

43
00:18:53,272 --> 00:18:54,512
There is a battle outside.

44
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:56,312
Do they train?

45
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:58,032
Train?

46
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:03,552
The infidel's sword is only pulled out
in fear of his life.

47
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:10,032
If the men are afraid in their own fort,
that isn't good news.

48
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:16,312
Ertuğrul Bey.

49
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:17,552
He raids the fort.

50
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:18,712
Don't come out.

51
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:20,432
What are you talking about?

52
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:22,832
How can Ertuğrul raid the fort
in broad daylight?

53
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,032
They slaughtered
the secret military unit from Nicaea.

54
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:28,592
They entered in disguise.

55
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:30,072
Let go of me.

56
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:38,792
How did Ertuğrul...

57
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:41,712
know about the secret military unit?

58
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:45,872
Keep this door locked.

59
00:19:46,192 --> 00:19:47,392
No matter what happens

60
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:49,032
don't open it, understand?

61
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:52,192
I know why Ertuğrul is here.

62
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:55,312
Ural! Don't do it, Ural!

63
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:57,072
They'll kill you too.

64
00:19:57,272 --> 00:19:58,592
I will not give up Dündar.

65
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:00,472
I'll kill them both.

66
00:20:00,672 --> 00:20:02,512
Move aside hatun, move!

67
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:49,032
-I'm going to take a walk.
-Let me accompany you.

68
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:51,952
-Ne need, I want to be alone.
-But, my lady...

69
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:54,912
I said no need.
What don't you understand?

70
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:03,192
-We can't let her go alone.
-I'll go after her.

71
00:21:03,352 --> 00:21:04,472
You follow.

72
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:06,352
Some of you stay here.

73
00:21:10,672 --> 00:21:11,792
You come too.

74
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:25,432
Helena is making her way to us.

75
00:21:25,672 --> 00:21:27,552
Leave the jackals with her to me.

76
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:31,952
You take care of the bastards here.

77
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,432
Come on alps, come on brothers.

78
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,512
Come on brothers.

79
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:19,592
Raid, run!

80
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:20,832
Run!

81
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:32,952
So, they sent me a dog like you...

82
00:22:33,712 --> 00:22:35,512
So, you want to be my Azrael...

83
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:17,472
My bey, this way!

84
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:18,712
I'm here brother.

85
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:26,832
Don't let them near the prisoner.
Kill them.

86
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:39,512
I'm here, my bey!

87
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:40,592
Dündar, are you hurt?

88
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:44,392
Why did you come here?

89
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:47,792
I should have died here.

90
00:24:47,912 --> 00:24:50,952
Dündar, you should know that
we never leave our men behind.

91
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:54,232
So many died for my sake, brother.

92
00:24:54,832 --> 00:24:56,392
I don't deserve to live.

93
00:24:57,072 --> 00:24:59,232
This is no time to be
feeling sorry for yourself.

94
00:25:05,152 --> 00:25:07,912
We will settle this back at the tribe.

95
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:29,832
-Sir!
-Take Dündar away.

96
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:31,512
There are too many, sir.

97
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:33,152
Do as I say, Dumrul!

98
00:26:57,072 --> 00:26:58,552
Sir!

99
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:28,672
-Where's the prisoner?
-They took him away.

100
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,832
Don't let them escape!
Follow them!

101
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:42,232
Come on, sir.

102
00:27:51,112 --> 00:27:52,232
Dündar.

103
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:54,232
Are you all right, brother?

104
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,312
I betrayed my brother.

105
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:58,192
I should have died.

106
00:28:06,632 --> 00:28:09,032
Head for the drain in the wall.

107
00:28:09,232 --> 00:28:10,832
Come on, sir.

108
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:45,872
Ertuğrul!

109
00:28:46,432 --> 00:28:47,952
Ertuğrul!

110
00:29:01,152 --> 00:29:02,752
I know where they are.

111
00:29:03,232 --> 00:29:04,792
Follow me.

112
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:14,792
This way, sir.

113
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,912
Wounded first. Hurry!

114
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:35,792
Vasilius must be close, sir.

115
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,872
He should be here any minute now.

116
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:43,992
If Bamsi managed to get
Helena out as well,

117
00:29:44,232 --> 00:29:46,232
we will bury Vasilius
alive in his fort, sir.

118
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,952
The next time I come here,
I'll raise our flag, Turgut.

119
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:53,272
And hang his lifeless body

120
00:29:53,352 --> 00:29:55,312
on the walls of this fort.

121
00:29:56,112 --> 00:29:58,112
I hope so, sir.

122
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,072
Come on, sir.

123
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:18,952
Once I get to the camp,

124
00:31:19,432 --> 00:31:21,712
I'll behead Acar and his daughter.

125
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:23,792
It won't soothe our pain,

126
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:26,152
but there will be fewer scumbags
on this earth.

127
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,152
I'd like to execute them

128
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:32,552
at my tribe to make an example
of them, Aliyar Bey.

129
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:35,152
Bring them to me, along with Teo.

130
00:31:35,552 --> 00:31:37,272
Well said, sir. Let's do that.

131
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:39,432
Sir, you go on ahead.

132
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:41,512
I'll close the hole and catch up to you.

133
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:43,712
All right, Turgut.

134
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:07,752
<i>Helena!</i>

135
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:10,792
<i>Where are you?</i>

136
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:15,472
<i>Helena!</i>

137
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,272
<i>Helena!</i>

138
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:22,752
Where are you?

139
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:25,432
Helena!

140
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:28,432
<i>Where are you?</i>

141
00:32:30,152 --> 00:32:32,192
<i>Answer me!</i>

142
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:37,832
<i>Helena!</i>

143
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:08,432
Miss, why are you running
away from us? Why are you here?

144
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:33,432
You insolent fool!

145
00:33:33,832 --> 00:33:35,592
Stop pestering her!

146
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:37,632
Bamsi!

147
00:33:45,912 --> 00:33:47,952
Come at me!

148
00:34:19,112 --> 00:34:20,672
Bamsi!

149
00:34:21,872 --> 00:34:23,472
Bamsi!

150
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,632
Bamsi!

151
00:34:43,312 --> 00:34:44,872
I knew you'd come.

152
00:34:52,432 --> 00:34:55,352
Helena, hold on.

153
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:57,352
Hold on.

154
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,712
Wait, what are you doing?

155
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,192
How could I leave you
to the hands of these savages?

156
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:08,112
How could I let you marry that bastard?

157
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,832
I can't thank you enough.

158
00:35:11,112 --> 00:35:13,312
Once more you saved my life, Bamsi.

159
00:35:13,672 --> 00:35:15,552
No, don't mention it.

160
00:35:16,392 --> 00:35:17,712
However,

161
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,032
I wish

162
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:21,552
I could have saved
my brother Doğan's life as well.

163
00:35:23,152 --> 00:35:24,912
I'm sorry for your loss.

164
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,432
I appreciate it, Helena.

165
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:31,952
Thank God you are alive.

166
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,592
-What about Dündar Bey?
-Oh, yes.

167
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,952
Don't worry,
Ertuğrul Bey went to save him.

168
00:35:52,112 --> 00:35:54,632
He will definitely get him back.

169
00:35:57,032 --> 00:36:00,872
My brothers!
Let's go back to our tribe, come on!

170
00:36:01,872 --> 00:36:04,512
Helena, let's go.

171
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:07,152
Come with me.

172
00:36:42,552 --> 00:36:43,592
God damn!

173
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:44,752
They got away.

174
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:47,192
Quick, follow them.

175
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:50,032
Quick! Find them
before they get your governor.

176
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,072
They closed off the hole with a rock.

177
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:10,312
What do you mean?

178
00:37:10,592 --> 00:37:12,112
We can't follow them from here.

179
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,832
Where does this tunnel go?

180
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:17,992
To the other end of the fort.

181
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:19,992
We can't catch up.

182
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:26,992
Ertuğrul.

183
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:28,912
I'll obliterate you all.

184
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,072
Your mother,

185
00:37:31,152 --> 00:37:32,392
your wife,

186
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:33,752
your children...

187
00:37:33,872 --> 00:37:35,512
I'll make you watch them die.

188
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:37,752
I'll kill you all!

189
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:50,152
God.

190
00:37:50,832 --> 00:37:53,672
Help my children and make it...

191
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:55,952
easy for them.

192
00:37:57,032 --> 00:37:59,192
Grant them victory.

193
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:03,392
Please, protect my children.

194
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:12,752
Mother.

195
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:16,272
Since you won't come inside,
take this cushion.

196
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:17,752
Here.

197
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:22,312
Thanks, dear.

198
00:38:32,872 --> 00:38:35,232
How hard it is to wait on tenterhooks.

199
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:40,472
I'm just too anxious, Mother.

200
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,912
Your son

201
00:38:45,232 --> 00:38:47,232
is with you right now.

202
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:50,072
Once he grows up,

203
00:38:50,752 --> 00:38:52,352
flourishes,

204
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:54,552
and starts riding his horse,

205
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:58,952
you will then understand
what it means to be a mother.

206
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,992
You will know the grief

207
00:39:03,752 --> 00:39:06,552
and fear of losing a child.

208
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:10,752
That stud

209
00:39:10,912 --> 00:39:12,712
will kick not the ground, but

210
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:15,352
your very heart.

211
00:39:17,512 --> 00:39:21,032
You will keep your mouth closed
and watch...

212
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:24,672
as your son bolts out to war.

213
00:39:30,432 --> 00:39:32,272
I have lived all this, dear.

214
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:34,872
I did.

215
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:38,232
I'm a mother.

216
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:40,152
I sealed my lips.

217
00:39:41,432 --> 00:39:43,712
My pain doesn't seep out.

218
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,872
However, I'm dying inside.

219
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:50,752
May God

220
00:39:51,112 --> 00:39:54,152
protect our children

221
00:39:54,752 --> 00:39:57,152
from ever parting ways.

222
00:39:57,872 --> 00:39:59,192
Amen.

223
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:02,752
How is Banu Çiçek holding up?

224
00:40:03,392 --> 00:40:04,752
Are you checking on her?

225
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:06,552
She's the same, Mother.

226
00:40:06,992 --> 00:40:08,752
Brought her food, didn't touch it.

227
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:10,392
No.

228
00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:12,032
That's not good.

229
00:40:13,112 --> 00:40:15,912
She's still pregnant,
she'll hurt the baby.

230
00:40:16,392 --> 00:40:18,992
You have to make sure she eats something.

231
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,912
Banu Çiçek may grieve today,

232
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:27,232
but she'll let it pass tomorrow.

233
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:32,072
God has blessed her
with the patience of a mother.

234
00:40:33,912 --> 00:40:36,552
The real issue is Dündar.

235
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:40,032
It's Dündar that keeps me

236
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,552
brooding over.

237
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,072
The thought of my sons

238
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,112
arguing with each other

239
00:40:47,232 --> 00:40:50,392
is eating away at my heart.

240
00:40:56,032 --> 00:40:58,392
What if Ertuğrul doesn't forgive Dündar?

241
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:37,472
Help me for the love of God.

242
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:39,792
Help me for the love of God.

243
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:44,032
I'm dying.

244
00:41:56,712 --> 00:41:58,552
Commander...

245
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,272
Commander...

246
00:42:00,632 --> 00:42:02,272
Commander!

247
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:05,232
Commander!

248
00:42:09,752 --> 00:42:11,112
How did this happen?

249
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:13,152
How did they get in?

250
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:15,912
They came in disguised as our soldiers.

251
00:42:16,872 --> 00:42:19,992
Your regent thought they were
the unit sent from Nicaea,

252
00:42:20,352 --> 00:42:22,392
and welcomed them with military honors.

253
00:42:25,552 --> 00:42:28,752
A fort that embraces its enemies.

254
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:30,712
A fort that doesn't

255
00:42:31,072 --> 00:42:32,592
know its enemies!

256
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:34,872
A fort that's full of soldiers

257
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:38,032
cut down as the clumsy cowards they are!

258
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:40,432
What's this fort?

259
00:42:40,712 --> 00:42:42,432
What kind of empire is this?

260
00:42:44,552 --> 00:42:45,992
Where is the regent commander?

261
00:42:46,432 --> 00:42:47,432
He died, sir.

262
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:23,032
We followed them to the drain hole.

263
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:26,592
But they got away.

264
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,192
Ertuğrul!

265
00:43:48,272 --> 00:43:50,192
Damn you!

266
00:43:50,312 --> 00:43:53,072
Wherever you are, to hell with you!

267
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:56,352
They won't run again, Vasilius.

268
00:43:57,512 --> 00:43:58,872
They won't run again.

269
00:43:59,712 --> 00:44:01,552
Damn!

270
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:04,392
God damn!

271
00:44:05,152 --> 00:44:06,672
For once...

272
00:44:06,832 --> 00:44:08,872
Be damned!

273
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:11,712
Why is it always me?

274
00:44:12,552 --> 00:44:14,192
Why?

275
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:22,112
Be damned!

276
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:14,152
God...

277
00:45:16,312 --> 00:45:19,192
I am stuck in this dead end,

278
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:21,392
so I'm begging you...

279
00:45:22,712 --> 00:45:24,952
spare me my children.

280
00:45:27,672 --> 00:45:30,312
Grant my children
that I relinquished for jihad

281
00:45:30,432 --> 00:45:32,912
with victory.

282
00:45:34,752 --> 00:45:36,352
Please God, help us.

283
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,672
<i>Mother Hayme!</i>

284
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:12,992
<i>May I enter?</i>

285
00:46:14,512 --> 00:46:15,832
Bamsi.

286
00:46:16,112 --> 00:46:17,312
Bamsi!

287
00:46:19,512 --> 00:46:20,672
Mother.

288
00:46:26,592 --> 00:46:28,992
I brought you a guest.

289
00:46:30,272 --> 00:46:31,672
We have a guest.

290
00:46:35,032 --> 00:46:36,632
Come in, Helena.

291
00:46:44,312 --> 00:46:46,872
Mother Hayme, would you accept
this unexpected visitor?

292
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:49,632
Welcome, my dear.

293
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:15,872
I can't thank you enough.

294
00:47:16,272 --> 00:47:19,512
You saved me from that monster.

295
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:22,392
I'm happy to see you here

296
00:47:22,512 --> 00:47:24,192
safe and sound, my dear.

297
00:47:26,992 --> 00:47:28,432
I'm so sorry

298
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,552
for Foreman Haçaturyan and Doğan Alp.

299
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:33,792
With all my heart, I believe

300
00:47:33,872 --> 00:47:36,312
that Ertuğrul Bey will save Dündar Bey.

301
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:39,432
Of course, my dear.

302
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:40,752
He will.

303
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:44,872
He'll make them pay
for all they have done.

304
00:47:45,872 --> 00:47:47,352
Vasilius and that Ural,

305
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:51,392
blinded by their ambitions,
are the only ones responsible.

306
00:47:55,232 --> 00:47:56,232
My dear.

307
00:47:56,872 --> 00:47:58,352
There's a time for everything.

308
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:00,912
But you should rest now.

309
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:03,432
You went through a lot.

310
00:48:04,152 --> 00:48:05,992
You are our family now.

311
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:08,392
If you so wish,

312
00:48:09,672 --> 00:48:12,352
this could be your permanent home.

313
00:48:18,192 --> 00:48:20,872
I have no one else left
other than you, Mother Hayme.

314
00:48:21,872 --> 00:48:23,232
This tribe is my home.

315
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:04,512
Vasilius.

316
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:06,872
Where is my cousin Helena?

317
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:08,752
Why didn't you bring her here?

318
00:49:14,592 --> 00:49:17,472
I sent my men after her,
they should be here soon.

319
00:49:20,152 --> 00:49:22,672
At this point I just hope she is okay.

320
00:49:24,512 --> 00:49:25,792
She will be okay.

321
00:49:54,432 --> 00:49:55,672
Sir.

322
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:03,112
This man

323
00:50:04,192 --> 00:50:05,832
has something to tell you.

324
00:50:13,232 --> 00:50:14,512
Sir...

325
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:15,792
Helena is...

326
00:50:22,872 --> 00:50:23,912
What about Helena?

327
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:26,832
The Turks, sir.

328
00:50:27,032 --> 00:50:29,592
They attacked us at the place
while we were waiting with Helena.

329
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:46,672
And?

330
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:52,272
They took her, sir.

331
00:50:56,912 --> 00:50:57,952
Helena fled from us.

332
00:51:03,752 --> 00:51:05,912
She went with the Turks of her own accord.

333
00:51:17,152 --> 00:51:19,072
Everyone but me died, sir.

334
00:51:22,192 --> 00:51:24,232
I got here as fast as I could to tell you.

335
00:51:27,632 --> 00:51:29,512
By Gods, sir, don't kill me please.

336
00:52:09,632 --> 00:52:11,472
A commander dropped his sword.

337
00:52:22,752 --> 00:52:23,912
Helena...

338
00:52:26,152 --> 00:52:27,912
So, you were the traitor, then?

339
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:32,872
From the very beginning...

340
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:35,472
it was you.

341
00:52:38,312 --> 00:52:39,272
Traitor.

342
00:52:40,112 --> 00:52:42,792
Since the very beginning... it was you?

343
00:52:43,512 --> 00:52:44,992
A traitor?

344
00:52:45,552 --> 00:52:46,512
You were the...

345
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:48,592
traitor?

346
00:52:49,712 --> 00:52:50,952
Since the beginning...

347
00:52:51,552 --> 00:52:52,792
you were the traitor?

348
00:52:53,192 --> 00:52:54,152
You?

349
00:52:55,552 --> 00:52:56,872
You were the traitor?

350
00:52:57,512 --> 00:52:58,472
Since...

351
00:52:59,472 --> 00:53:00,392
the very beginning?

352
00:53:10,872 --> 00:53:11,832
Traitor.

353
00:53:52,032 --> 00:53:58,672
<i>Long live Ertuğrul Bey!</i>

354
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:10,992
Mother.

355
00:54:11,592 --> 00:54:13,032
Our men are on their way.

356
00:54:18,552 --> 00:54:20,152
God.

357
00:54:20,432 --> 00:54:22,232
Hear my prayers.

358
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:26,872
Don't make me go through
the pain of losing a child again.

359
00:54:28,472 --> 00:54:29,672
<i>Bismillah.</i>

360
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:31,152
<i>Bismillah.</i>

361
00:54:33,472 --> 00:54:35,912
<i>Long live Ertuğrul Bey!</i>

362
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:46,272
<i>Long live Ertuğrul Bey!</i>

363
00:54:46,352 --> 00:54:49,632
<i>Long live Ertuğrul Bey!</i>

364
00:55:12,832 --> 00:55:17,992
<i>Long live Ertuğrul Bey!</i>

365
00:55:18,072 --> 00:55:23,792
<i>Long live Ertuğrul Bey!</i>

366
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:28,952
Mother.

367
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:36,312
Thank God!

368
00:55:44,712 --> 00:55:49,872
<i>Long live Ertuğrul Bey!</i>

369
00:56:20,952 --> 00:56:21,952
Mother.

370
00:56:22,072 --> 00:56:23,712
<i>Long live Ertuğrul Bey!</i>

371
00:56:23,992 --> 00:56:25,352
Son!

372
00:56:28,032 --> 00:56:29,232
Son.

373
00:56:32,672 --> 00:56:34,152
Thank God!

374
00:56:39,712 --> 00:56:41,992
Now that you got him safely back,

375
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:44,992
I couldn't be happier, son.

376
00:56:49,752 --> 00:56:51,472
You brought hope to our marquee.

377
00:56:54,872 --> 00:56:56,552
Thank God for

378
00:56:56,912 --> 00:56:59,552
giving me a son like you.

379
00:56:59,752 --> 00:57:01,152
Ertuğrul Bey.

380
00:57:03,312 --> 00:57:04,712
Thank you, Mother.

381
00:57:45,352 --> 00:57:46,552
Forgive me, sister.

382
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:49,072
Forgive me.

383
00:57:57,312 --> 00:57:58,632
When Doğan's body

384
00:57:59,072 --> 00:58:01,472
is cold as snowy peaks,

385
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:03,872
and he's lying under the ground,

386
00:58:05,352 --> 00:58:06,792
would it ever be possible

387
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:11,112
for Doğan to see his child?

388
00:58:14,232 --> 00:58:15,792
Would it ever be possible for him

389
00:58:16,272 --> 00:58:17,952
to come back to my tent again?

390
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,752
Tell me, Dündar Bey.

391
00:58:37,432 --> 00:58:39,352
What do you want to hear?

392
00:59:33,592 --> 00:59:35,032
Brave men of Kayi!

393
00:59:36,392 --> 00:59:38,792
Sisters and brothers that

394
00:59:39,152 --> 00:59:40,592
without a second thought,

395
00:59:40,752 --> 00:59:43,792
sent their sons and husbands to war

396
00:59:44,272 --> 00:59:45,592
for our cause.

397
00:59:45,992 --> 00:59:47,912
We brought victory to our tribe.

398
00:59:48,912 --> 00:59:50,272
Thank God

399
00:59:50,592 --> 00:59:53,472
there were no martyrs today.

400
00:59:54,392 --> 00:59:55,752
However,

401
00:59:56,312 --> 00:59:57,792
we are still grief-stricken.

402
00:59:59,232 --> 01:00:01,192
We won't stop until

403
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:04,032
we raise our flags in Karacahisar,

404
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:05,752
or possibly,

405
01:00:06,112 --> 01:00:08,112
until we collapse that viper's nest

406
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:10,872
around our enemies.

407
01:00:11,872 --> 01:00:12,832
May God

408
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:15,672
help us prevail in our cause,

409
01:00:15,952 --> 01:00:18,392
or possibly, grant us martyrdom.

410
01:00:18,832 --> 01:00:20,272
Amen!

411
01:00:20,352 --> 01:00:23,192
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

412
01:00:26,472 --> 01:00:29,032
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

413
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:42,912
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

414
01:01:16,872 --> 01:01:18,512
The ignoble bey

415
01:01:19,792 --> 01:01:22,112
of my noble tribe, Acar.

416
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:28,472
I have good news for you.

417
01:01:30,752 --> 01:01:32,392
We saved Dündar Bey.

418
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,952
You know what's left now?

419
01:01:43,072 --> 01:01:44,552
You and your betrayal.

420
01:01:45,752 --> 01:01:47,752
I betrayed no one.

421
01:01:53,912 --> 01:01:56,192
Your daughter Günyeli
confessed everything.

422
01:01:58,232 --> 01:02:01,472
Told me everything you plotted together.

423
01:02:02,392 --> 01:02:03,992
She told me how you rushed

424
01:02:04,392 --> 01:02:06,512
to tell Ural about Dündar Bey.

425
01:02:06,872 --> 01:02:08,272
Lies.

426
01:02:09,352 --> 01:02:12,952
Just how much did you torture her
to convince her to side with you?

427
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,632
My daughter would never
say something like that.

428
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:19,232
You are a cruel man, Aliyar Bey.

429
01:02:20,192 --> 01:02:21,192
A cruel man.

430
01:02:23,192 --> 01:02:24,632
Acar.

431
01:02:27,152 --> 01:02:29,592
You'll die tomorrow.

432
01:02:32,592 --> 01:02:33,672
Kutluca!

433
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:03,832
Now that I know

434
01:03:04,672 --> 01:03:06,312
both my sons are alive...

435
01:03:07,912 --> 01:03:10,632
this old woman can die in peace.

436
01:03:14,672 --> 01:03:16,432
God bless you, son.

437
01:03:18,872 --> 01:03:21,672
Amen, Mother.

438
01:03:27,312 --> 01:03:30,192
My dear son.

439
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:32,992
How could they hurt you?

440
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:37,752
How on earth did this
happen to you, Dündar?

441
01:03:43,512 --> 01:03:44,752
I deserved it, Mother.

442
01:03:44,872 --> 01:03:46,232
I deserved it.

443
01:03:46,672 --> 01:03:48,072
I made a mistake.

444
01:03:49,872 --> 01:03:51,672
And I was paid back in kind.

445
01:03:56,872 --> 01:03:58,632
Doğan Alp died because of me.

446
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:03,752
I can't redeem myself.

447
01:04:07,352 --> 01:04:08,632
I didn't listen to Halime.

448
01:04:12,112 --> 01:04:13,952
I didn't listen to my big brother.

449
01:04:24,552 --> 01:04:27,392
<i>Sir, may I enter?</i>

450
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:29,432
Come in, Bamsi.

451
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:37,952
Sir.

452
01:04:40,992 --> 01:04:42,512
Welcome, Helena.

453
01:04:43,472 --> 01:04:44,872
Happy to see you here.

454
01:04:44,992 --> 01:04:48,432
I appreciate all that you've
done for me, Ertuğrul Bey.

455
01:04:49,592 --> 01:04:51,232
You were entrusted to us, Helena.

456
01:04:53,632 --> 01:04:56,192
We couldn't let you marry
someone you hate.

457
01:04:58,632 --> 01:04:59,872
Just tell us.

458
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:02,592
We will take you wherever you want.

459
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:08,672
I feel at home here.

460
01:05:13,432 --> 01:05:15,712
I'd like to stay here if you'd let me.

461
01:05:29,152 --> 01:05:30,672
If that's what you want,

462
01:05:32,752 --> 01:05:34,352
then this is your tribe now.

463
01:05:34,992 --> 01:05:36,272
Your home.

464
01:05:38,872 --> 01:05:40,512
And you are my sister.

465
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:44,592
My mother is your mother.

466
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:46,472
Consider Halime as your sister.

467
01:06:54,996 --> 01:06:56,076
Governor Vasilius.

468
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:01,676
What's this silence about?

469
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:03,436
What?

470
01:07:04,196 --> 01:07:05,196
Are you giving up already?

471
01:07:09,276 --> 01:07:10,676
She sold me out.

472
01:07:12,276 --> 01:07:13,396
She crossed me.

473
01:07:16,996 --> 01:07:18,596
She ran off with the Turks.

474
01:07:25,356 --> 01:07:28,156
She ran off with the enemy...

475
01:07:30,236 --> 01:07:31,756
With the backstabbers...

476
01:07:33,796 --> 01:07:37,196
Vasilius, calm your nerves.

477
01:07:38,756 --> 01:07:40,796
You are overlooking something.

478
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:42,956
The unit coming from Nicaea.

479
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:47,076
Helena must have told Ertuğrul
that they were on the way.

480
01:07:47,756 --> 01:07:49,236
Maybe it's better that she ran away.

481
01:07:50,996 --> 01:07:55,156
I didn't tell Helena
there was a unit coming here.

482
01:07:59,036 --> 01:08:03,956
Then, just like how you have spies here,

483
01:08:04,756 --> 01:08:07,436
there must be spies in the castle
of your emperor in Nicaea.

484
01:08:07,556 --> 01:08:09,116
I know, Ural.

485
01:08:09,556 --> 01:08:10,956
They are everywhere!

486
01:08:11,356 --> 01:08:12,356
Damn it!

487
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:20,876
I just want to split
all the traitors in two!

488
01:08:22,876 --> 01:08:24,556
I want their blood.

489
01:08:25,636 --> 01:08:28,836
I want to skin them alive.

490
01:08:31,476 --> 01:08:34,756
They probably acted against you

491
01:08:35,316 --> 01:08:36,876
in the hope that you'd retaliate.

492
01:08:38,356 --> 01:08:39,676
You won't go after them.

493
01:08:39,996 --> 01:08:42,836
Now is my time to shine.

494
01:08:43,276 --> 01:08:44,756
Your desire for blood will be satisfied.

495
01:08:45,716 --> 01:08:46,796
Everything is ready.

496
01:08:47,996 --> 01:08:49,676
I've organized the other beys.

497
01:08:50,516 --> 01:08:54,436
They will hold off Ertuğrul and Aliyar
at the inn

498
01:08:55,036 --> 01:08:56,556
under the pretense of a meeting.

499
01:08:57,396 --> 01:09:00,196
And I'll go take back my tribe.

500
01:09:02,036 --> 01:09:03,876
-And then...
-And then what?

501
01:09:04,636 --> 01:09:09,236
And then I'll deal with
Ertuğrul and Aliyar.

502
01:09:12,196 --> 01:09:13,716
And of course, Helena.

503
01:09:14,436 --> 01:09:16,276
Once I get back my tribe,

504
01:09:17,036 --> 01:09:20,996
I'll kill Aliyar
along with Ertuğrul first,

505
01:09:21,796 --> 01:09:23,996
and then deal with Helena.

506
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,396
Then, do as you like.

507
01:09:30,636 --> 01:09:33,636
Bring Helena to me.

508
01:09:37,596 --> 01:09:39,436
Everything is planned, but...

509
01:09:40,996 --> 01:09:42,796
But what?

510
01:09:43,676 --> 01:09:44,836
What is it, Ural?

511
01:09:47,156 --> 01:09:51,836
If there happens to be unexpected
resistance from the tribe,

512
01:09:52,156 --> 01:09:54,516
I'll need your men to support me.

513
01:09:55,996 --> 01:09:58,836
I trust my beys and soldiers.

514
01:09:59,596 --> 01:10:01,436
However, I'd like to make sure...

515
01:10:02,876 --> 01:10:04,236
it will all go smoothly.

516
01:10:04,836 --> 01:10:06,996
I just want to know
that I have your support.

517
01:10:07,956 --> 01:10:10,516
Go and reclaim your tribe.

518
01:10:11,316 --> 01:10:12,916
You have my full support.

519
01:10:13,996 --> 01:10:15,116
Go.

520
01:10:42,516 --> 01:10:44,316
I heard Günyeli Hatun snitched.

521
01:10:45,196 --> 01:10:46,996
If Acar Bey talks as well,

522
01:10:48,196 --> 01:10:51,276
Aliyar Bey will cut us all down.

523
01:10:51,636 --> 01:10:52,916
This can't go on.

524
01:10:53,676 --> 01:10:55,156
We trusted Ural Bey.

525
01:10:56,036 --> 01:10:58,356
We have been waiting
in fear for so long.

526
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,276
How long is it going to keep going?

527
01:11:02,436 --> 01:11:03,956
Why don't we end this already?

528
01:11:04,436 --> 01:11:07,636
Are we waiting for Ertuğrul
to execute us all?

529
01:11:09,156 --> 01:11:11,116
<i>-May I enter?</i>
-Come in.

530
01:11:15,356 --> 01:11:16,876
I brought a letter from Ural Bey.

531
01:11:37,116 --> 01:11:38,916
What does it say?

532
01:11:42,796 --> 01:11:45,916
"I know you have been waiting
for a long time for this,

533
01:11:46,876 --> 01:11:48,796
but the moment has come for slaughter.

534
01:11:51,596 --> 01:11:55,996
With the sunrise, bathe in the blood
of those who have dared

535
01:11:56,196 --> 01:11:58,396
tarnish the honor of my tribe."

536
01:11:59,036 --> 01:12:00,076
Slaughter?

537
01:12:00,876 --> 01:12:02,276
Are we going to revolt?

538
01:12:05,476 --> 01:12:08,356
He wants us to unite with
the other Turkmen beys

539
01:12:08,596 --> 01:12:10,316
and slaughter everyone

540
01:12:10,556 --> 01:12:12,316
once he lures

541
01:12:12,716 --> 01:12:14,476
Ertuğrul and Aliyar Bey
to the Hanlı Bazaar.

542
01:12:15,276 --> 01:12:18,276
He says we'll blindside them
when they have no leaders.

543
01:12:18,676 --> 01:12:20,116
What if we botch it?

544
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:23,156
What if Acar Bey snitches on us?

545
01:12:23,476 --> 01:12:25,156
Then we won't wait until sunrise

546
01:12:25,276 --> 01:12:27,396
and we'll fight
till our dying breaths.

547
01:12:27,756 --> 01:12:29,356
Acar Bey is an honorable man.

548
01:12:29,836 --> 01:12:32,636
He won't die an ignoble death
by snitching on us.

549
01:12:33,836 --> 01:12:35,596
Go sharpen your swords

550
01:12:35,756 --> 01:12:37,276
instead of whining like a dog.

551
01:12:38,516 --> 01:12:40,436
Did you forget for what cause
we devoted ourselves?

552
01:12:41,956 --> 01:12:43,236
Ural Bey is right.

553
01:12:43,676 --> 01:12:45,236
We must unite now

554
01:12:46,076 --> 01:12:47,516
and take what's rightfully ours.

555
01:12:47,676 --> 01:12:48,916
We will take what's ours.

556
01:12:50,516 --> 01:12:53,596
Whatever Ural Bey says in his letter,

557
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,996
we will follow his instruction.

558
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:12,076
Your brother trusted you with his life
and you let him down, Dündar.

559
01:13:13,236 --> 01:13:15,956
You let Doğan die because of

560
01:13:16,556 --> 01:13:19,076
your fantasies about that woman.

561
01:13:19,556 --> 01:13:21,716
Doğan, who was always so brave...

562
01:13:23,396 --> 01:13:24,476
Big brother.

563
01:13:26,636 --> 01:13:27,596
Everything you say

564
01:13:28,996 --> 01:13:30,276
is true.

565
01:13:34,996 --> 01:13:37,076
I wish you'd left me at the fort

566
01:13:38,356 --> 01:13:40,396
-so I could just die.
-No!

567
01:13:42,636 --> 01:13:43,756
Don't say that.

568
01:13:44,396 --> 01:13:45,996
For God's sake.

569
01:13:48,836 --> 01:13:50,596
You are my brother, Dündar.

570
01:13:51,836 --> 01:13:53,196
How could I let them kill you?

571
01:13:54,716 --> 01:13:57,316
Two wrongs don't make a right.

572
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,196
Your conscience will be your judge.

573
01:14:09,836 --> 01:14:11,956
You're yet to realize
the importance of our cause.

574
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:17,516
You don't realize your responsibilities
as a bey.

575
01:14:19,196 --> 01:14:23,836
You showed weakness and put us
through worse hell than our enemies have.

576
01:14:24,476 --> 01:14:25,676
Enough, son.

577
01:14:26,836 --> 01:14:27,836
Say no more.

578
01:14:28,716 --> 01:14:31,636
I can't bear seeing you two like this.

579
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,676
This pain wrecked us all.

580
01:14:39,636 --> 01:14:41,036
I've had enough.

581
01:14:44,796 --> 01:14:46,196
He's right, though, Mother.

582
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:49,636
I don't deserve to be a bey for my tribe.

583
01:14:52,116 --> 01:14:53,716
I've done more harm than good.

584
01:14:58,676 --> 01:15:00,116
I have no excuses.

585
01:15:02,676 --> 01:15:04,756
-In the future--
-You have no future here, Dündar.

586
01:15:07,156 --> 01:15:11,756
We can't show weakness in our cause,
we need real men.

587
01:15:22,676 --> 01:15:24,076
You may be my brother.

588
01:15:25,276 --> 01:15:26,556
But from now on,

589
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,436
you are not a bey, nor an alp

590
01:15:35,316 --> 01:15:36,316
of our tribe.

591
01:16:13,876 --> 01:16:14,956
Here, sit.

592
01:16:23,956 --> 01:16:25,116
My God.

593
01:16:29,396 --> 01:16:31,676
Don't test me with my children.

594
01:16:34,996 --> 01:16:36,436
Help me, God.

595
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:41,916
Help me bear this pain.

596
01:16:43,796 --> 01:16:45,476
Please.

597
01:16:46,756 --> 01:16:49,956
Mother, be patient.

598
01:16:51,036 --> 01:16:52,156
Please.

599
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:45,036
Turgut.

600
01:17:46,196 --> 01:17:47,196
Brother.

601
01:17:48,236 --> 01:17:49,796
I see Doğan

602
01:17:50,996 --> 01:17:52,636
as I look at the food.

603
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:57,236
You mean the fried meat?

604
01:17:57,996 --> 01:17:59,756
Sure, why not?

605
01:18:00,036 --> 01:18:01,156
Fried meat.

606
01:18:01,676 --> 01:18:03,156
As I look at it,

607
01:18:03,796 --> 01:18:07,356
I'm reminded of the times
we carried sheep with him.

608
01:18:28,836 --> 01:18:30,556
It's my win!

609
01:18:30,636 --> 01:18:32,596
No, I won!

610
01:18:32,716 --> 01:18:34,716
-I got here first.
-No, I got here first!

611
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,156
I passed the line first!

612
01:18:36,236 --> 01:18:38,476
It's my win!

613
01:18:38,556 --> 01:18:40,596
I won!

614
01:18:43,436 --> 01:18:46,076
He wouldn't stop boasting about that.

615
01:18:48,316 --> 01:18:51,396
Even the sheep would outrun him
if he would let it go.

616
01:18:51,596 --> 01:18:54,196
But he wouldn't budge.

617
01:19:00,396 --> 01:19:03,596
He was always arguing with us.

618
01:19:05,876 --> 01:19:06,876
However,

619
01:19:08,116 --> 01:19:10,916
when he declared his love
to Banu Çiçek...

620
01:19:11,556 --> 01:19:15,036
That night, he was sitting
by the campfire,

621
01:19:15,516 --> 01:19:18,996
brooding like a dove, just like this.

622
01:19:19,476 --> 01:19:22,916
I went and asked him what he was up to.

623
01:19:24,156 --> 01:19:28,156
I'm going to ask Banu Çiçek to marry me.

624
01:19:29,116 --> 01:19:31,756
But I'm not quite sure how.

625
01:19:31,956 --> 01:19:33,196
Like this, brother.

626
01:19:36,756 --> 01:19:39,476
Smitten by your love,

627
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:42,876
my yearning for you
will reduce me to ashes.

628
01:19:44,836 --> 01:19:46,116
Not bad.

629
01:19:48,036 --> 01:19:49,996
I am smitten by your love,

630
01:19:50,636 --> 01:19:52,756
and yearning for you
will reduce me to ashes.

631
01:19:55,236 --> 01:19:56,316
What else should I say?

632
01:19:56,916 --> 01:19:58,636
You should go on like this.

633
01:19:58,956 --> 01:20:00,236
Like this...

634
01:20:01,036 --> 01:20:04,636
Your gaze pierced my heart like an arrow.

635
01:20:05,396 --> 01:20:07,316
Into the well that is your beauty,

636
01:20:07,756 --> 01:20:10,716
I fell like the prophet Joseph.

637
01:20:12,556 --> 01:20:16,236
I feel like a dry leaf floating
through the desert.

638
01:20:17,716 --> 01:20:19,676
How do you know all of this?

639
01:20:20,036 --> 01:20:23,756
It's not so much me
as the one that makes me say it all.

640
01:20:29,596 --> 01:20:31,316
I was smitten by your love.

641
01:20:32,476 --> 01:20:35,196
Yearning for you...

642
01:20:37,476 --> 01:20:40,516
<i>He went ahead and said to Banu Çiçek</i>
<i>what I had prepared.</i>

643
01:20:40,596 --> 01:20:41,836
Çiçek Hatun.

644
01:20:43,436 --> 01:20:44,996
I was smitten by your love.

645
01:20:45,996 --> 01:20:47,876
Your gaze somehow

646
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:49,996
pierced right through my heart.

647
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:54,636
You are a deep well and I fell inside you.

648
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:58,556
You are like a desert
and I got lost within you.

649
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:01,236
What's all this gibberish, Doğan Alp?

650
01:21:02,116 --> 01:21:03,716
I'm not quite sure myself.

651
01:21:04,636 --> 01:21:05,756
Curses, Bamsi!

652
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:08,796
Whatever!

653
01:21:09,796 --> 01:21:10,796
Here goes!

654
01:21:11,636 --> 01:21:13,996
I'm not good at beautiful phrases,
Çiçek Hatun.

655
01:21:16,596 --> 01:21:17,596
Banu Çiçek.

656
01:21:18,476 --> 01:21:19,796
Be my wife.

657
01:21:20,796 --> 01:21:22,236
Please accept me as your husband.

658
01:21:30,796 --> 01:21:32,316
If that's what you want...

659
01:21:33,836 --> 01:21:34,956
then allow me to

660
01:21:35,476 --> 01:21:36,796
give you my life

661
01:21:37,796 --> 01:21:39,236
and bring peace to your heart.

662
01:21:41,116 --> 01:21:44,036
I'll make your tent my palace,

663
01:21:44,756 --> 01:21:46,556
and you my safe haven.

664
01:21:47,596 --> 01:21:52,036
Your troubles are my food,
happiness is my sun.

665
01:21:53,156 --> 01:21:54,996
And my life is your life.

666
01:22:04,796 --> 01:22:05,796
Doğan Alp?

667
01:22:09,036 --> 01:22:10,476
<i>And when she accepted,</i>

668
01:22:10,956 --> 01:22:12,156
<i>you should have seen him.</i>

669
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,476
He froze like a deer before a hunter.

670
01:22:16,476 --> 01:22:20,116
And he came to his senses
after getting slapped on the cheek.

671
01:22:22,316 --> 01:22:23,516
Thank God.

672
01:22:27,116 --> 01:22:28,276
Did I just...

673
01:22:29,036 --> 01:22:30,916
Wait, I don't get it.

674
01:22:33,196 --> 01:22:37,676
You said yes because I asked you
to be my wife, right?

675
01:22:37,836 --> 01:22:38,836
Indeed I did.

676
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:45,036
So I asked you to be my wife,
and you accepted, am I right?

677
01:22:45,156 --> 01:22:46,716
You said yes, you'll be my wife.

678
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:47,996
Correct, Doğan Alp.

679
01:22:50,316 --> 01:22:53,756
Then let me go tell Ertuğrul Bey

680
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:58,596
so that we can go and ask
Tuğtekin Bey for your hand in marriage.

681
01:22:59,236 --> 01:23:00,076
Sure.

682
01:23:05,316 --> 01:23:07,236
<i>My God!</i>

683
01:23:19,436 --> 01:23:20,996
Poor Doğan.

684
01:23:24,196 --> 01:23:25,316
Brother.

685
01:23:30,996 --> 01:23:32,556
From now on,

686
01:23:32,956 --> 01:23:34,916
all we can do is to think of Doğan

687
01:23:35,796 --> 01:23:38,236
as our flag and let it fly.

688
01:23:38,756 --> 01:23:42,316
It's our duty to pierce the armor

689
01:23:42,556 --> 01:23:45,436
of the heathens with that flag, brother.

690
01:23:45,716 --> 01:23:47,276
To pierce their hearts.

691
01:24:40,356 --> 01:24:41,596
<i>Helena Hatun.</i>

692
01:24:42,636 --> 01:24:43,916
<i>May I enter?</i>

693
01:24:46,796 --> 01:24:48,156
Come in, Bamsi.

694
01:24:49,516 --> 01:24:50,796
<i>Bismillah.</i>

695
01:24:56,036 --> 01:24:57,436
Hi.

696
01:24:58,116 --> 01:24:59,076
He...

697
01:24:59,356 --> 01:25:01,836
Helena Hatun, I...

698
01:25:02,756 --> 01:25:06,196
I came to ask if you need anything.

699
01:25:08,356 --> 01:25:09,836
Thanks, Bamsi.

700
01:25:10,516 --> 01:25:11,916
They are treating me well.

701
01:25:12,476 --> 01:25:14,996
Sure, of course they will.

702
01:25:15,116 --> 01:25:17,796
You are one of us now.

703
01:25:19,836 --> 01:25:20,996
One of our women.

704
01:25:21,756 --> 01:25:22,836
Helena Hatun...

705
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:28,316
I need to tell you something.

706
01:25:30,676 --> 01:25:31,716
Yes, Bamsi?

707
01:25:36,196 --> 01:25:37,436
Helena Hatun...

708
01:25:39,036 --> 01:25:41,676
you know me.

709
01:25:41,796 --> 01:25:44,116
They call me the mountain bear.

710
01:25:44,716 --> 01:25:45,756
However,

711
01:25:47,076 --> 01:25:50,196
even this mountain bear has a heart.

712
01:25:52,596 --> 01:25:54,476
And it keeps beating

713
01:25:54,996 --> 01:25:57,036
and beating and beating.

714
01:25:57,356 --> 01:25:58,596
And it keeps on beating.

715
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:04,116
Don't laugh, Helena Hatun.

716
01:26:04,276 --> 01:26:06,396
It's already hard enough
to express my feelings.

717
01:26:07,716 --> 01:26:09,036
Sorry, Bamsi.

718
01:26:09,556 --> 01:26:12,396
I'm so excited
I don't know what to do with myself.

719
01:26:13,876 --> 01:26:16,916
All right, then. Let me keep going.

720
01:26:20,076 --> 01:26:23,356
Helena Hatun,
what I'm trying to say is that...

721
01:26:25,076 --> 01:26:27,076
In the huge heart

722
01:26:27,996 --> 01:26:29,796
of this huge man,

723
01:26:30,876 --> 01:26:32,276
it is you whom he cherishes.

724
01:26:36,036 --> 01:26:37,436
And your love...

725
01:26:39,396 --> 01:26:43,556
This love is what keeps me alive, Helena.

726
01:26:45,716 --> 01:26:47,756
Now, what I mean to say is that...

727
01:26:48,116 --> 01:26:50,316
Come to this mountain bear,

728
01:26:50,636 --> 01:26:53,036
and if you so wish,

729
01:26:53,636 --> 01:26:54,956
be my wedded wife.

730
01:27:01,796 --> 01:27:02,796
I...

731
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:07,756
I want you to

732
01:27:08,476 --> 01:27:10,276
never stop laughing, Bamsi.

733
01:27:13,476 --> 01:27:15,316
I want us to laugh together.

734
01:27:19,596 --> 01:27:21,196
I can't live without you.

735
01:27:25,236 --> 01:27:26,116
I...

736
01:27:26,876 --> 01:27:28,916
I want to be your wife, too.

737
01:27:30,676 --> 01:27:33,236
I want to be by your side all my life.

738
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,396
Be by my side, then!

739
01:27:38,396 --> 01:27:40,076
I'll be by your side as well.

740
01:27:40,996 --> 01:27:43,596
Sure, why not? Of course
we will be side by side.

741
01:27:45,756 --> 01:27:48,796
Be by my side all your life...

742
01:27:49,676 --> 01:27:51,156
Let's live side by side.

743
01:27:51,316 --> 01:27:53,036
Stand by my side.

744
01:27:55,916 --> 01:27:56,996
Helena...

745
01:27:59,076 --> 01:28:00,156
Helena...

746
01:28:01,796 --> 01:28:03,876
I'll never let you leave my side.

747
01:28:04,516 --> 01:28:06,396
I will never let you go, Helena.

748
01:28:07,396 --> 01:28:10,796
I mean I'll have to go when there is war.

749
01:28:10,956 --> 01:28:14,196
I will fight, and you will be
weaving rugs here.

750
01:28:14,396 --> 01:28:17,116
However, you'll always be by my side.

751
01:28:17,276 --> 01:28:19,316
I'll never let you go.

752
01:28:21,876 --> 01:28:25,796
Why are they beating the drums?
Did they find out about us?

753
01:28:26,956 --> 01:28:28,036
Bamsi!

754
01:28:29,116 --> 01:28:30,356
This is different.

755
01:28:32,836 --> 01:28:35,156
Different. What could it be?

756
01:28:35,356 --> 01:28:37,516
Let me check it out.

757
01:28:38,796 --> 01:28:40,676
I'll never let you go.

758
01:28:41,356 --> 01:28:42,676
Drums are beating.

759
01:29:19,916 --> 01:29:20,876
Traitors!

760
01:29:42,436 --> 01:29:43,516
Traitors!

761
01:29:49,196 --> 01:29:50,396
Traitors!

762
01:29:56,476 --> 01:30:00,036
Kill the traitors!

763
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:10,356
Kill them!

764
01:30:24,156 --> 01:30:28,676
Traitors! Traitors!

765
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:38,876
I brought them, sir.

766
01:30:39,516 --> 01:30:40,876
Thank you, Aliyar Bey.

767
01:30:48,316 --> 01:30:50,996
Die, you scum!

768
01:30:51,116 --> 01:30:53,076
Banu Çiçek!

769
01:30:54,436 --> 01:30:55,676
Calm down.

770
01:30:59,596 --> 01:31:01,116
Do you want to go?

771
01:31:01,316 --> 01:31:04,156
I want to see, Halime Hatun.
Let me go, I'll just watch.

772
01:31:04,476 --> 01:31:06,076
I want to watch her die.

773
01:31:30,076 --> 01:31:31,356
I'm no traitor.

774
01:31:32,676 --> 01:31:33,956
You can't do this to me.

775
01:31:35,196 --> 01:31:36,396
We have procedures.

776
01:31:37,636 --> 01:31:39,276
There is law. Let us go.

777
01:31:40,316 --> 01:31:43,596
Father, you must do something!

778
01:31:51,596 --> 01:31:52,996
Bastard!

779
01:31:53,676 --> 01:31:54,836
You bastard!

780
01:31:55,396 --> 01:31:57,116
-Sir!
-Sir!

781
01:32:10,516 --> 01:32:12,036
Showing mercy to the traitors means

782
01:32:12,876 --> 01:32:14,556
betraying those
who have been hurt by them.

783
01:32:15,796 --> 01:32:17,556
Burn in hell, Aliyar.

784
01:32:18,436 --> 01:32:19,796
You betrayed your father.

785
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:22,916
You betrayed your brother.

786
01:32:23,556 --> 01:32:25,196
You betrayed our traditions.

787
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:27,276
Burn in Hell!

788
01:32:41,476 --> 01:32:43,676
We are at war with the heathens.

789
01:32:45,516 --> 01:32:46,756
We have enemies that dare

790
01:32:47,876 --> 01:32:49,236
tarnish our honor,

791
01:32:49,996 --> 01:32:50,996
our belief,

792
01:32:51,676 --> 01:32:53,156
and our traditions.

793
01:32:53,956 --> 01:32:55,396
We can't turn a blind eye

794
01:32:56,516 --> 01:32:59,436
to the traitors among us.

795
01:33:06,636 --> 01:33:07,636
Now,

796
01:33:09,156 --> 01:33:13,036
justice is served,
and the culprits eliminated.

797
01:33:40,916 --> 01:33:41,836
Dad!

798
01:33:53,676 --> 01:33:55,036
Dad!

799
01:33:56,956 --> 01:33:57,836
Dad!

800
01:34:00,156 --> 01:34:02,636
Dad!

801
01:34:04,316 --> 01:34:05,396
Dad!

802
01:34:07,076 --> 01:34:09,636
Dad!

803
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:11,316
Dad!

804
01:34:12,636 --> 01:34:13,716
Dad!

805
01:34:34,116 --> 01:34:36,276
Forgive me, sir!

806
01:34:36,956 --> 01:34:38,996
I was fooled by my father.

807
01:34:39,276 --> 01:34:40,276
I beg you.

808
01:34:51,196 --> 01:34:52,956
You trampled on my dignity.

809
01:34:55,316 --> 01:34:57,076
Forgiving you now

810
01:34:57,876 --> 01:34:59,476
would be unhuman.

811
01:35:46,956 --> 01:35:49,236
They got what they deserved.

812
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:51,836
Burn in Hell.

813
01:35:53,676 --> 01:35:56,996
All evil shall be brought to justice.

814
01:36:12,596 --> 01:36:15,396
I said I'd let you know
every time I killed your men.

815
01:36:18,076 --> 01:36:20,116
The unit coming from Nicaea...

816
01:36:21,996 --> 01:36:22,996
is no more.

817
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:33,756
The soldiers at your castle...

818
01:36:35,636 --> 01:36:36,876
are no more.

819
01:36:39,116 --> 01:36:41,156
I piled them all up, Teo.

820
01:36:45,836 --> 01:36:46,836
And now,

821
01:36:47,556 --> 01:36:49,516
it's time to raise our flags.

822
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:23,196
We took down a thousand for one.

823
01:38:25,236 --> 01:38:26,876
Now, we are victorious,

824
01:38:27,996 --> 01:38:30,916
and the traitors defeated.

825
01:38:31,116 --> 01:38:37,996
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

826
01:38:45,556 --> 01:38:52,436
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Aliyar Bey!

827
01:38:59,756 --> 01:39:06,636
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Aliyar Bey!

828
01:39:17,916 --> 01:39:21,476
Send Ertuğrul and Aliyar a letter.

829
01:39:22,396 --> 01:39:23,676
Tell them that

830
01:39:24,956 --> 01:39:26,236
Ural Bey is

831
01:39:26,516 --> 01:39:29,676
trying to trick you
into taking his side.

832
01:39:30,476 --> 01:39:33,396
Tell them that it's time to unite
and take measure.

833
01:39:33,796 --> 01:39:37,836
Ertuğrul Bey and Aliyar Bey
suspect that we meet you in secret.

834
01:39:37,916 --> 01:39:39,756
What if they distrust our words?

835
01:39:40,476 --> 01:39:41,716
Then,

836
01:39:41,916 --> 01:39:44,156
tell him that Ural is threatening to

837
01:39:44,716 --> 01:39:48,396
attack our tribes with the help
of Vasilius and his men.

838
01:39:50,316 --> 01:39:51,596
Spring has come.

839
01:39:52,316 --> 01:39:55,076
Tell him that you will have to

840
01:39:55,196 --> 01:39:57,716
leave this cursed land
along with your tribes.

841
01:39:58,316 --> 01:40:01,996
They can't afford for three tribes
to leave right now.

842
01:40:02,596 --> 01:40:03,596
Then what?

843
01:40:06,396 --> 01:40:11,036
Then, while you hold them off at the inn,

844
01:40:11,276 --> 01:40:14,556
I'll reclaim my tribe.

845
01:40:18,556 --> 01:40:21,036
Since there'll be no one to resist,

846
01:40:21,196 --> 01:40:23,796
we will settle it without any bloodshed.

847
01:40:27,876 --> 01:40:29,516
What about Vasilius?

848
01:40:29,836 --> 01:40:34,156
Will you keep working with that heathen
after you take back your tribe?

849
01:40:36,076 --> 01:40:38,436
By staying at that heathen's fort,

850
01:40:38,716 --> 01:40:41,116
am I betraying my tribe
and our traditions?

851
01:40:42,156 --> 01:40:43,436
Is this what you mean?

852
01:40:45,156 --> 01:40:47,556
Vasilius already fell into my trap.

853
01:40:48,156 --> 01:40:49,636
He thinks that

854
01:40:49,916 --> 01:40:53,796
I'll take you and leave these lands.

855
01:40:54,716 --> 01:40:57,716
I'd never walk out on the Hanlı Bazaar,

856
01:40:57,996 --> 01:41:01,236
or the riches of Karacahisar.

857
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:02,996
You should all know this.

858
01:41:03,156 --> 01:41:06,556
Conquering Karacahisar is
not an easy feat, is it?

859
01:41:07,556 --> 01:41:10,916
I've already conquered his fort.

860
01:41:13,516 --> 01:41:16,356
The gates of the fort are wide open.

861
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:19,676
And about Vasilius,

862
01:41:20,316 --> 01:41:24,076
Ertuğrul dealt with
the emperor's reinforcements.

863
01:41:26,716 --> 01:41:29,396
Vasilius is trapped in his fort.

864
01:41:30,876 --> 01:41:35,596
He has no strength left to fight
and protect his fort.

865
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:39,756
Once we conquer the fort,
the Sultan will acknowledge us.

866
01:41:39,956 --> 01:41:43,516
We will hold all the riches
and trade routes.

867
01:41:54,876 --> 01:41:57,316
The real fight begins now, Aliyar Bey.

868
01:41:59,036 --> 01:42:01,996
Everyone will show their true colors.

869
01:42:02,316 --> 01:42:04,996
All the beys that sided with Ural
are shaking with fear.

870
01:42:05,516 --> 01:42:08,036
We showed them how it will end for them.

871
01:42:08,476 --> 01:42:11,636
But you are right.
They'll go on a rampage now.

872
01:42:12,076 --> 01:42:14,996
They'll plot a coupe.

873
01:42:15,276 --> 01:42:17,276
They will attack desperately.

874
01:42:17,596 --> 01:42:21,156
Ural will even add Vasilius' support
to his forces.

875
01:42:22,196 --> 01:42:26,716
Plotters are not just within, Aliyar Bey.

876
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:29,916
My men are keeping watch
day and night, sir.

877
01:42:30,836 --> 01:42:32,796
-Kutluca.
-Yes, sir.

878
01:42:33,036 --> 01:42:34,676
Tighten the security.

879
01:42:35,116 --> 01:42:36,596
Let our people know.

880
01:42:37,036 --> 01:42:39,076
Anything could happen now.

881
01:42:39,196 --> 01:42:40,836
They must be alert.

882
01:42:41,116 --> 01:42:43,116
If anybody sees or hears something

883
01:42:43,436 --> 01:42:44,836
they should let you know.

884
01:42:45,036 --> 01:42:46,236
Yes, sir.

885
01:42:52,676 --> 01:42:54,236
Take care, sir.

886
01:42:54,396 --> 01:42:55,836
You too, Aliyar Bey.

887
01:42:59,796 --> 01:43:01,076
Have a safe journey.

888
01:43:12,316 --> 01:43:14,916
We have one last mission, everybody.

889
01:43:22,756 --> 01:43:24,036
Let's go.

890
01:43:40,836 --> 01:43:42,476
Did you get my letter?

891
01:43:42,556 --> 01:43:43,556
Yes, sir.

892
01:43:43,956 --> 01:43:48,436
All the beys and soldiers
are ready to die for you.

893
01:43:49,236 --> 01:43:53,276
You've proven that you are
worthy beys of my father, Candar Bey.

894
01:43:55,476 --> 01:43:56,676
However,

895
01:43:57,636 --> 01:43:58,636
Acar Bey is...

896
01:43:59,036 --> 01:44:00,636
What about him?

897
01:44:02,316 --> 01:44:04,356
We got news from loyal soldiers.

898
01:44:05,796 --> 01:44:08,156
They executed him along with his daughter.

899
01:44:13,516 --> 01:44:16,156
They killed Teo as well.

900
01:44:17,316 --> 01:44:21,316
Acar Bey died honorably
and didn't denounce any of us.

901
01:44:23,076 --> 01:44:25,876
As long as I have honorable men
such as Acar Bey,

902
01:44:26,276 --> 01:44:27,676
let alone Ertuğrul,

903
01:44:28,316 --> 01:44:30,356
not even Karacahisar
could stand against me.

904
01:44:31,956 --> 01:44:35,276
His and my brother's oppression

905
01:44:35,476 --> 01:44:37,156
of my tribe will come to an end.

906
01:44:38,196 --> 01:44:40,676
It's time we took

907
01:44:41,236 --> 01:44:42,476
all the riches.

908
01:44:46,196 --> 01:44:48,476
After we conquer Karacahisar

909
01:44:48,756 --> 01:44:51,476
we will raid all the villages,

910
01:44:51,636 --> 01:44:54,076
each one bigger than the last,
until we reach Nicaea.

911
01:44:55,036 --> 01:44:57,436
We will get all the riches

912
01:44:57,716 --> 01:45:00,836
while also getting a taste of their blood.

913
01:45:43,396 --> 01:45:44,916
We avenged you, Doğan.

914
01:45:47,956 --> 01:45:49,596
God rest your soul.

915
01:45:50,756 --> 01:45:51,836
Rest in peace.

916
01:46:00,596 --> 01:46:01,996
We will protect

917
01:46:03,356 --> 01:46:04,796
your memory, your wife,

918
01:46:07,396 --> 01:46:09,436
and your child, brother.

919
01:46:12,556 --> 01:46:15,516
That's true, brother.
Don't you worry about it.

920
01:46:15,916 --> 01:46:19,316
This mountain bear
will take care of your child.

921
01:46:20,116 --> 01:46:23,476
I'll raise him to be a fine man.

922
01:46:23,756 --> 01:46:25,676
I'll teach him to use dual swords.

923
01:46:25,836 --> 01:46:27,196
Don't you worry.

924
01:46:55,493 --> 01:46:56,493
Bey.

925
01:46:57,293 --> 01:46:59,253
-Thank you, Hatun.
-Enjoy.

926
01:47:00,333 --> 01:47:02,493
-Mother.
-Thank you, my dear girl.

927
01:47:02,893 --> 01:47:03,933
Enjoy.

928
01:47:09,613 --> 01:47:11,213
They got what they deserved.

929
01:47:13,293 --> 01:47:18,293
The execution of Günyeli
and Acar has taught a lesson

930
01:47:18,573 --> 01:47:20,213
to the traitors left behind.

931
01:47:22,413 --> 01:47:25,213
Doubt does not suit us, I know.

932
01:47:26,133 --> 01:47:30,413
God made my heart ache so much
over Günyeli,

933
01:47:30,773 --> 01:47:32,133
that I couldn't keep quiet.

934
01:47:33,253 --> 01:47:36,613
You sensed everything correctly
with your beautiful heart, my dear.

935
01:47:37,853 --> 01:47:39,893
You were right all along.

936
01:47:41,333 --> 01:47:43,613
People are capable of anything.

937
01:47:44,693 --> 01:47:48,973
I wish we could suss out a person's
personality by looking at their face.

938
01:47:51,213 --> 01:47:52,093
<i>Bey.</i>

939
01:47:52,813 --> 01:47:54,293
<i>Bey, may I come in?</i>

940
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:56,413
Come in, Bamsi.

941
01:48:09,253 --> 01:48:10,573
Come in, dear. Come.

942
01:48:11,573 --> 01:48:14,133
On this bitter day,
you're our consolation.

943
01:48:21,693 --> 01:48:24,453
What is it that you're trying to say
but can't, Bamsi?

944
01:48:26,413 --> 01:48:30,213
Bey, I've been trying
to think of how to say it,

945
01:48:30,573 --> 01:48:31,973
but I couldn't find a way.

946
01:48:32,813 --> 01:48:35,813
That's why I won't beat around the bush.

947
01:48:37,413 --> 01:48:40,453
Bey, if you and Mother Hayme allow it,

948
01:48:40,613 --> 01:48:43,173
I'd like to tie the knot
with Helena Hatun.

949
01:49:01,213 --> 01:49:03,253
What do you think about this,
Helena Hatun?

950
01:49:03,933 --> 01:49:06,533
I'd like to leave these sad days behind,

951
01:49:07,613 --> 01:49:10,373
to be Bamsi's companion for life,

952
01:49:10,893 --> 01:49:13,893
to be a consolation for the pain
he feels for the brother he lost.

953
01:49:14,373 --> 01:49:16,133
Such nice words, dear.

954
01:49:17,133 --> 01:49:22,453
Such a good thing will be a consolation
to all of us in these bitter times.

955
01:49:26,853 --> 01:49:28,853
May God make your home into a heaven.

956
01:49:30,973 --> 01:49:33,253
If you wish to unite,

957
01:49:34,293 --> 01:49:37,733
all I can do is
wish you a fruitful marriage.

958
01:49:38,373 --> 01:49:39,853
God bless you, Bey.

959
01:49:40,133 --> 01:49:41,773
God bless you.

960
01:49:42,093 --> 01:49:43,253
Thank you, Bey.

961
01:49:46,573 --> 01:49:48,693
Don't ever upset Helena Hatun, Bamsi.

962
01:49:49,773 --> 01:49:52,773
And you, Helena Hatun,
be the cure to all of Bamsi's problems.

963
01:49:54,773 --> 01:49:58,693
Bey... Bey, I could never upset her.
I could never upset her.

964
01:50:00,093 --> 01:50:03,693
As long as we have you, we can
scale every mountain, Ertuğrul Bey.

965
01:50:03,853 --> 01:50:05,333
Thank you, Helena Hatun.

966
01:50:08,133 --> 01:50:09,293
Go on then.

967
01:50:09,813 --> 01:50:11,213
Be quick and prepare.

968
01:50:12,813 --> 01:50:15,173
Let's do this in the evening.

969
01:50:16,933 --> 01:50:19,373
Good things should be done right away.

970
01:50:19,453 --> 01:50:22,253
Good. Thank you, Bey.

971
01:50:22,613 --> 01:50:24,613
All right. As you wish, Bey.

972
01:50:24,733 --> 01:50:26,733
As you wish. Bey...

973
01:50:28,893 --> 01:50:29,933
Mother Hayme.

974
01:50:31,213 --> 01:50:33,413
-Congratulations, dear.
-God bless my brother!

975
01:50:33,893 --> 01:50:35,453
Thank you, Bey.

976
01:50:36,253 --> 01:50:37,533
Helena...

977
01:50:41,413 --> 01:50:43,413
-Mother.
-Bamsi.

978
01:50:44,573 --> 01:50:45,853
Congratulations, son.

979
01:50:46,373 --> 01:50:48,093
Thank you, Mother. Thank you.

980
01:50:49,813 --> 01:50:50,653
Sister.

981
01:50:53,733 --> 01:50:55,773
We should go. We're going.

982
01:51:34,373 --> 01:51:35,853
They executed Teo.

983
01:51:53,093 --> 01:51:56,293
They took Helena from you...

984
01:51:57,613 --> 01:52:02,013
but they took my father and my child
from me.

985
01:52:03,373 --> 01:52:06,293
They killed your best soldier...

986
01:52:07,613 --> 01:52:10,653
but they killed my most loyal bey.

987
01:52:11,973 --> 01:52:13,533
They murdered Acar Bey.

988
01:52:14,733 --> 01:52:16,413
They will pay a heavy price for this.

989
01:52:18,653 --> 01:52:20,733
We'll see, Ural Bey.

990
01:52:29,813 --> 01:52:33,053
This will be my last move.

991
01:52:34,653 --> 01:52:37,613
When I go to the village tomorrow,

992
01:52:37,933 --> 01:52:41,773
I will kill every single one
of those beys who opposed me!

993
01:52:42,373 --> 01:52:45,773
I will kill off every alp that resists me!

994
01:52:47,653 --> 01:52:48,573
Then...

995
01:52:49,653 --> 01:52:51,733
I will keep the promise I made.

996
01:52:53,253 --> 01:52:54,173
What promise?

997
01:53:00,453 --> 01:53:02,173
When I raid the village,

998
01:53:02,653 --> 01:53:07,333
Ertuğrul’s mother and wife
will be at the rug shop.

999
01:53:10,293 --> 01:53:12,493
Revenge!

1000
01:53:14,453 --> 01:53:16,653
Sweet revenge.

1001
01:53:18,013 --> 01:53:20,333
A taste so sweet
that you can't get enough...

1002
01:53:21,453 --> 01:53:23,293
even if you eat until you burst.

1003
01:53:25,733 --> 01:53:26,973
Do you want me to tell you…

1004
01:53:29,533 --> 01:53:31,933
what will happen if you don't succeed?

1005
01:53:45,973 --> 01:53:46,813
I...

1006
01:53:48,053 --> 01:53:50,973
will have to flip the chessboard over.

1007
01:54:00,933 --> 01:54:02,613
If you can't make it,

1008
01:54:03,413 --> 01:54:07,653
I will burn down
every single village in these lands.

1009
01:54:09,213 --> 01:54:12,333
I will kill off everyone.

1010
01:54:16,373 --> 01:54:18,733
I fear your anger, Vasilius.

1011
01:54:19,613 --> 01:54:21,453
I know what you're capable of.

1012
01:54:22,693 --> 01:54:27,693
I will not allow my tribe or the other
Turkmen tribes to stay in these lands.

1013
01:54:28,813 --> 01:54:34,173
However, when I go into my village
to fight for the last time,

1014
01:54:35,653 --> 01:54:37,893
I need to know you are behind me.

1015
01:54:38,773 --> 01:54:43,933
I will get this done without you needing
to get your hands dirty.

1016
01:54:45,573 --> 01:54:48,533
Instead of Ertuğrul,
it is I who will be in front of you.

1017
01:54:56,893 --> 01:54:58,293
I'll stand behind you.

1018
01:55:05,733 --> 01:55:09,893
Sword in hand,
my soldiers beside me.

1019
01:55:40,013 --> 01:55:41,053
Amen.

1020
01:56:00,173 --> 01:56:01,213
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

1021
01:56:19,533 --> 01:56:21,413
Seeing you like this hurts me, Mother.

1022
01:56:31,173 --> 01:56:37,333
And seeing Dündar so helpless
and so full of shame pains me, son.

1023
01:56:41,453 --> 01:56:44,773
If anyone in my tribe
revealed that kind of weakness,

1024
01:56:44,893 --> 01:56:47,293
they would've faced
the same punishment, Mother.

1025
01:56:51,573 --> 01:56:58,493
Bamsi, Turgut, Banu Çiçek,
and many alps...

1026
01:57:00,613 --> 01:57:02,333
are turning away from him.

1027
01:57:05,373 --> 01:57:06,693
He is ashamed.

1028
01:57:07,613 --> 01:57:11,693
If I privilege him
for being Suleyman Shah's son,

1029
01:57:12,333 --> 01:57:14,653
how will I look the people of my tribe
in the face?

1030
01:57:17,333 --> 01:57:20,893
Ertuğrul, son, he is still so young.

1031
01:57:22,693 --> 01:57:25,533
He is too proud to pay this price.

1032
01:57:27,453 --> 01:57:31,733
Banu Çiçek and her child paid
the price for my brother's weakness.

1033
01:57:34,133 --> 01:57:38,253
Dündar took Doğan away
from us, from his comrades.

1034
01:57:39,573 --> 01:57:44,693
Ertuğrul, you place such a heavy burden
on Dündar's back...

1035
01:57:46,013 --> 01:57:50,533
that he doesn't know
what to do underneath it.

1036
01:57:51,573 --> 01:57:55,493
I took away the burden
that he didn't deserve.

1037
01:57:56,893 --> 01:57:59,773
I did it so that he could face himself.

1038
01:58:03,133 --> 01:58:07,613
I wanted him to know what it is to be
a bey worthy of Suleyman Shah's tribe.

1039
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:16,573
When you left Sungurtekin, Gündoğdu,

1040
01:58:17,133 --> 01:58:22,253
and your many brothers behind,
who was with you, son, huh?

1041
01:58:23,413 --> 01:58:25,213
You've forgotten about those days so fast.

1042
01:58:27,373 --> 01:58:31,933
He must face his shame.
This will improve his character.

1043
01:58:33,453 --> 01:58:39,093
When he proves himself,
he'll go back to being an alp and a bey.

1044
01:58:40,853 --> 01:58:42,053
That's all I'm going to say.

1045
01:58:50,413 --> 01:58:52,613
It's time for you to be
the solution to our problems.

1046
01:58:56,853 --> 01:58:58,653
Let's go to Bamsi Alp's wedding.

1047
01:59:41,613 --> 01:59:43,533
Look at my brother!

1048
01:59:46,613 --> 01:59:48,333
You look so handsome, brother!

1049
01:59:48,493 --> 01:59:51,573
Brothers, no wonder Helena Hatun
fell for this brave man.

1050
01:59:53,533 --> 01:59:54,413
Right.

1051
01:59:54,773 --> 01:59:57,573
How wonderful it is
that God put you two together.

1052
01:59:58,013 --> 01:59:59,093
Be very happy.

1053
01:59:59,453 --> 02:00:04,453
Thank you, brothers, thank you.
I wish you the same good fortune.

1054
02:00:04,933 --> 02:00:06,133
Amen.

1055
02:00:06,573 --> 02:00:09,733
Now that you have your lover,
you won't ever see us.

1056
02:00:15,133 --> 02:00:19,853
Günkut, you're being tactless.

1057
02:00:20,013 --> 02:00:23,013
But I won't get mad at you tonight.

1058
02:00:27,053 --> 02:00:28,253
He's right, brother.

1059
02:00:28,853 --> 02:00:31,093
Your weapons aren't
your only companions anymore.

1060
02:00:32,293 --> 02:00:35,573
From now on,
we'll see you only during wars.

1061
02:00:36,053 --> 02:00:40,853
But... But don't say that, brothers.
Don't say that.

1062
02:00:41,693 --> 02:00:44,013
My love for my weapons is boundless.

1063
02:00:45,133 --> 02:00:46,613
This is different.

1064
02:00:47,733 --> 02:00:51,893
Besides, I love my brothers...

1065
02:00:54,653 --> 02:00:56,573
as much as I love my woman.

1066
02:00:57,053 --> 02:01:00,373
Brothers, I feel rejuvenated.

1067
02:01:01,133 --> 02:01:04,373
So, brother, is Bamsi Beyrek
even stronger now?

1068
02:01:04,773 --> 02:01:09,333
Brother, I'm even more eager
to cut off the heads of heretics!

1069
02:01:09,413 --> 02:01:11,173
Look at you!

1070
02:01:12,733 --> 02:01:14,653
-Bless you!
-Thank you.

1071
02:01:17,333 --> 02:01:18,373
Brother.

1072
02:01:23,893 --> 02:01:26,173
This jawshan is
our wedding present to you.

1073
02:01:27,413 --> 02:01:29,693
Put this around your neck
and never take it off.

1074
02:01:38,453 --> 02:01:42,573
May God protect you from sharp swords,

1075
02:01:43,173 --> 02:01:45,173
evil eyes, and bitter words, brother.

1076
02:01:45,373 --> 02:01:46,253
Amen.

1077
02:01:54,893 --> 02:01:59,413
From now on,
I will never take this off my neck.

1078
02:02:00,133 --> 02:02:01,413
Never.

1079
02:02:02,693 --> 02:02:03,893
My brothers.

1080
02:02:05,213 --> 02:02:06,413
My brave brothers.

1081
02:02:06,933 --> 02:02:09,093
May God never...

1082
02:02:09,573 --> 02:02:12,893
May God never let us part again. Never.

1083
02:02:13,413 --> 02:02:15,053
-Amen.
-Brother.

1084
02:02:17,453 --> 02:02:18,773
My lion-hearted brother.

1085
02:02:25,373 --> 02:02:26,333
Bless you.

1086
02:02:41,133 --> 02:02:42,133
Bless you.

1087
02:02:42,533 --> 02:02:43,533
Bless you all.

1088
02:02:44,853 --> 02:02:47,693
Come on, brother. It's time.

1089
02:02:48,733 --> 02:02:49,613
It's time.

1090
02:02:50,373 --> 02:02:51,293
It's time.

1091
02:02:51,893 --> 02:02:53,733
It's time to go now. Come on.

1092
02:02:57,693 --> 02:03:00,533
<i>Look at the bride, look at her</i>

1093
02:03:00,813 --> 02:03:03,453
<i>She's got henna on her hand</i>

1094
02:03:03,853 --> 02:03:06,573
<i>Don't say anything to her</i>

1095
02:03:06,893 --> 02:03:09,493
<i>Or she'll go back to her home</i>

1096
02:03:09,853 --> 02:03:12,613
<i>Her door has henna on it</i>

1097
02:03:12,853 --> 02:03:15,453
<i>She's an angel in her heart</i>

1098
02:03:15,893 --> 02:03:18,733
<i>Oh bride, God bless your henna</i>

1099
02:03:18,813 --> 02:03:21,533
<i>May all your life be sweet</i>

1100
02:03:21,933 --> 02:03:24,573
<i>Look at the bride, look at her</i>

1101
02:03:24,893 --> 02:03:27,213
<i>She's got henna on her hand</i>

1102
02:03:27,333 --> 02:03:30,773
Bless you, Helena.
You look so beautiful.

1103
02:03:32,213 --> 02:03:34,133
Yes, bless her.

1104
02:03:36,933 --> 02:03:40,653
You've helped me a lot.
I am grateful to you.

1105
02:03:41,173 --> 02:03:42,733
I can't thank you enough.

1106
02:03:43,493 --> 02:03:46,133
We've liked you from the start.

1107
02:03:47,293 --> 02:03:51,293
From now on, we'll experience
the good moments together in our village.

1108
02:03:51,693 --> 02:03:55,973
Together, we'll welcome the spring.
Together, we'll say goodbye to the winter.

1109
02:03:57,213 --> 02:03:58,213
I hope so.

1110
02:04:00,493 --> 02:04:05,413
From now on, I'll weave rugs
in the workshop, just like you do,

1111
02:04:05,573 --> 02:04:07,133
as I wait for my man.

1112
02:04:12,093 --> 02:04:15,613
I'll share in your pain and your joy.

1113
02:04:16,693 --> 02:04:21,693
<i>Don't say anything to her</i>
<i>Or she'll go back to her home</i>

1114
02:04:21,773 --> 02:04:22,853
Thank you.

1115
02:04:23,013 --> 02:04:25,493
<i>Her door has henna on it</i>

1116
02:04:25,933 --> 02:04:28,573
<i>She is an angel in her heart</i>

1117
02:04:28,853 --> 02:04:31,693
<i>Oh bride, God bless your henna</i>

1118
02:04:31,893 --> 02:04:34,853
<i>May all your life be sweet</i>

1119
02:04:39,333 --> 02:04:40,493
Give me your hand, dear.

1120
02:04:41,173 --> 02:04:46,973
<i>Don't say anything to her</i>
<i>Or she'll go back to her home</i>

1121
02:04:47,693 --> 02:04:50,853
Don't be afraid. This is henna.

1122
02:04:52,053 --> 02:04:55,453
We apply it on our soldiers and women

1123
02:04:55,973 --> 02:05:00,733
so that they sacrifice themselves for God
and dedicate their lives to each other.

1124
02:05:00,853 --> 02:05:05,013
<i>Look at the bride, look at her</i>
<i>She's got henna on her hand</i>

1125
02:05:05,333 --> 02:05:07,773
<i>Don't say anything to her</i>

1126
02:05:07,853 --> 02:05:09,533
In the name of God.

1127
02:05:11,693 --> 02:05:16,933
The henna is kneaded with love...

1128
02:05:17,653 --> 02:05:21,013
respect, compassion and loyalty.

1129
02:05:23,653 --> 02:05:26,293
<i>Look at the bride, look at her</i>

1130
02:05:26,653 --> 02:05:29,453
<i>She's got henna on her hand</i>

1131
02:05:29,693 --> 02:05:32,453
<i>Don't say anything to her</i>

1132
02:05:32,653 --> 02:05:34,693
<i>Or she'll go back to her home</i>

1133
02:05:34,893 --> 02:05:36,853
The henna is applied on our palms...

1134
02:05:38,013 --> 02:05:40,733
but its meaning
is inscribed on our hearts.

1135
02:05:41,733 --> 02:05:44,653
<i>Oh bride, God bless your henna</i>

1136
02:05:44,933 --> 02:05:47,693
<i>May all your life be sweet</i>

1137
02:05:48,933 --> 02:05:53,773
I don't know why, but I feel like crying.

1138
02:05:54,613 --> 02:06:00,213
I can't explain it, but I'm both happy...

1139
02:06:01,413 --> 02:06:02,413
and sad.

1140
02:06:04,173 --> 02:06:09,333
You're crying, but you keep going.
That's tradition.

1141
02:06:10,293 --> 02:06:11,973
You're one of us now.

1142
02:06:13,933 --> 02:06:16,573
That's why you are so affected.

1143
02:06:18,693 --> 02:06:21,293
<i>Don't say anything to her</i>

1144
02:06:21,653 --> 02:06:24,293
<i>Or she'll go back to her home</i>

1145
02:06:24,653 --> 02:06:27,213
<i>Her door has henna on it</i>

1146
02:06:28,773 --> 02:06:30,373
May your home be fruitful...

1147
02:06:31,773 --> 02:06:32,973
and peaceful.

1148
02:06:33,933 --> 02:06:36,173
<i>May all your life be sweet</i>

1149
02:06:37,213 --> 02:06:38,293
God bless your henna.

1150
02:06:38,893 --> 02:06:40,573
-Amen.
-Amen.

1151
02:06:41,213 --> 02:06:45,413
May God protect you
from evil eyes, bitter words,

1152
02:06:46,413 --> 02:06:49,373
troubles and disasters.

1153
02:06:50,773 --> 02:06:52,373
May you have many babies.

1154
02:06:53,573 --> 02:06:56,693
May your lineage go on forever.

1155
02:07:23,813 --> 02:07:26,533
-Halime, dear.
-Give it to me, Mother. Let me put it on.

1156
02:07:32,293 --> 02:07:37,973
May your ears never hear a bad word.
May you never endure grief.

1157
02:07:38,813 --> 02:07:41,813
May everyone who looks at you
see the good in your heart.

1158
02:07:43,493 --> 02:07:46,293
May you never glimpse an evil eye, dear.

1159
02:07:53,493 --> 02:07:55,373
May you never endure any pain.

1160
02:08:02,293 --> 02:08:05,013
May your tongue taste only sweetness.

1161
02:08:22,573 --> 02:08:24,173
May your home never see cruelty.

1162
02:08:26,133 --> 02:08:28,853
May your heart be ever in comfort.

1163
02:08:33,693 --> 02:08:35,253
I'm so glad I met you.

1164
02:08:37,173 --> 02:08:38,053
I'm glad I'm here.

1165
02:08:40,573 --> 02:08:45,693
I want to learn everything
about you and your traditions.

1166
02:08:46,133 --> 02:08:47,053
Everything.

1167
02:08:49,253 --> 02:08:55,213
From now on, Bamsi Alp is
both your man and your companion, dear.

1168
02:08:56,333 --> 02:08:58,653
He'll teach you everything he knows.

1169
02:09:00,453 --> 02:09:03,253
And you'll be his first student.

1170
02:09:08,253 --> 02:09:10,053
Go on now. It's time.

1171
02:09:18,013 --> 02:09:18,893
Come.

1172
02:09:36,533 --> 02:09:37,973
Wait a minute, my dear Çolpan.

1173
02:09:41,093 --> 02:09:45,933
Allow me to gaze on your beautiful face...

1174
02:09:46,813 --> 02:09:48,973
one last time.

1175
02:09:51,773 --> 02:09:54,453
Why are you speaking
as though you're giving up, Bey?

1176
02:09:55,053 --> 02:09:58,293
Everything is ready.
It's time, my dear Çolpan.

1177
02:09:59,213 --> 02:10:03,053
I will come to this castle again,

1178
02:10:03,853 --> 02:10:06,613
not as a parasite,
but as the bey of the Cavdar Tribe.

1179
02:10:07,853 --> 02:10:13,573
I'll come back as a powerful,
free man and take you away.

1180
02:10:15,773 --> 02:10:18,413
For me, what is important
is your life, Bey.

1181
02:10:19,573 --> 02:10:21,693
Whatever happens, come back alive.

1182
02:10:24,973 --> 02:10:26,173
Oh, my dear Çolpan...

1183
02:10:30,653 --> 02:10:32,733
If you only knew what I was going through.

1184
02:10:34,373 --> 02:10:39,093
Since I was separated from my tribe,
I've felt like I was living in hell.

1185
02:10:41,373 --> 02:10:42,773
Am I even alive now?

1186
02:10:43,893 --> 02:10:47,053
All these years, I served my tribe.

1187
02:10:48,333 --> 02:10:53,293
And then I got stuck in this stone castle.

1188
02:10:57,853 --> 02:11:02,293
Do you think it's easy for the son
of a bey to go through all this?

1189
02:11:03,093 --> 02:11:05,733
Now, I have two roads before me.

1190
02:11:07,773 --> 02:11:09,733
I'll either get what I deserve,

1191
02:11:10,333 --> 02:11:14,373
or I'll die and keep my honor.

1192
02:11:15,293 --> 02:11:19,173
God forbid, Bey.
If you die, I'll die with you.

1193
02:11:24,173 --> 02:11:25,213
Don't worry.

1194
02:11:26,373 --> 02:11:27,533
We'll be fine.

1195
02:11:29,973 --> 02:11:35,053
We'll take care of this
with the support of Vasilius and my beys.

1196
02:11:37,493 --> 02:11:38,933
I made a promise, Çolpan.

1197
02:11:39,853 --> 02:11:42,893
Our bloodline will go on, but...

1198
02:11:44,173 --> 02:11:46,413
Ertuğrul's will end.

1199
02:11:48,733 --> 02:11:52,733
Then it'll be this castle's turn.

1200
02:11:55,373 --> 02:12:00,413
Your father's castle
will become your husband's castle.

1201
02:12:01,213 --> 02:12:02,373
I hope so, Bey.

1202
02:12:03,373 --> 02:12:06,613
I want my kids to run around and grow up
in this castle, just like I did.

1203
02:12:14,253 --> 02:12:16,813
One of the things that pleases God most

1204
02:12:17,373 --> 02:12:20,293
is a couple being joined together
in holy matrimony.

1205
02:12:24,013 --> 02:12:26,093
As our great prophet once said,

1206
02:12:26,733 --> 02:12:30,773
one person is just a half, and only
becomes whole after getting married.

1207
02:12:33,573 --> 02:12:39,453
Before His Holiness
married His daughter, Fatıma, to Ali,

1208
02:12:39,773 --> 02:12:43,533
He summoned them before Him
and said,

1209
02:12:44,573 --> 02:12:51,293
"Ali, I will marry you to my daughter,
but only if you'll be a slave to her.

1210
02:12:52,293 --> 02:12:58,013
Fatıma, I will marry you to Ali,
but only if you'll be a concubine to him."

1211
02:12:59,253 --> 02:13:02,053
They applied this philosophy
to their lives.

1212
02:13:02,893 --> 02:13:06,373
And that marriage
set an example to all humanity.

1213
02:13:09,693 --> 02:13:13,933
I hope your marriage will be built
upon this philosophy, too.

1214
02:13:14,253 --> 02:13:15,093
Amen.

1215
02:13:15,733 --> 02:13:16,573
Amen.

1216
02:13:20,813 --> 02:13:21,693
Yes, dear.

1217
02:13:24,653 --> 02:13:29,773
Sir, these people have embraced me.

1218
02:13:30,853 --> 02:13:34,453
They didn't let me feel the absence
of my parents.

1219
02:13:36,013 --> 02:13:41,413
They looked after me like a sister
without questioning my religion or nation.

1220
02:13:44,133 --> 02:13:49,253
From now on, I wish for your religion,
glorious Islam, to be my religion.

1221
02:14:00,413 --> 02:14:05,453
If you see fit, I want to become
a Muslim before the wedding

1222
02:14:05,653 --> 02:14:06,893
and then get married.

1223
02:14:17,693 --> 02:14:21,173
Our mighty God says in Surah Ali İmran,

1224
02:14:22,093 --> 02:14:27,013
"You treated them softly.
If you were mean and cold-hearted,

1225
02:14:27,653 --> 02:14:30,493
no doubt, they would all leave your side."

1226
02:14:31,493 --> 02:14:35,893
Happy are the people
who acted according to the holy word...

1227
02:14:38,093 --> 02:14:41,413
and happy are you
who has decided to be Muslim.

1228
02:14:43,893 --> 02:14:46,053
Now, repeat what I say.

1229
02:15:08,133 --> 02:15:09,413
May God bless you for it.

1230
02:15:10,013 --> 02:15:11,133
Amen.

1231
02:15:12,013 --> 02:15:12,973
Amen.

1232
02:15:14,533 --> 02:15:15,413
Amen.

1233
02:15:17,853 --> 02:15:23,333
Now, we need to give you a name that will
help you arrive at the right path.

1234
02:15:25,293 --> 02:15:28,173
Let your name be Hafsa Hatun
from now on.

1235
02:15:29,533 --> 02:15:31,293
May God make you neighbors

1236
02:15:31,613 --> 02:15:38,573
with our prophet and his blessed wife,
whose name you just took, in heaven.

1237
02:15:39,133 --> 02:15:40,573
-Amen.
-Amen.

1238
02:15:41,533 --> 02:15:42,533
Amen.

1239
02:15:46,453 --> 02:15:52,293
Ertuğrul Bey, you secured
your victory by winning hearts, too.

1240
02:15:53,773 --> 02:15:56,173
You helped a person find the right path.

1241
02:15:56,693 --> 02:15:59,253
This is the most beautiful victory
in God's eyes.

1242
02:16:00,133 --> 02:16:03,173
Such a victory could
only belong to the bey of beys.

1243
02:17:22,493 --> 02:17:27,293
My little... sweet...

1244
02:17:29,253 --> 02:17:31,053
traitorous lover.

1245
02:17:35,893 --> 02:17:38,013
I'm grateful to you.

1246
02:17:46,933 --> 02:17:51,733
You've reminded me
why I hadn't loved a woman

1247
02:17:52,853 --> 02:17:54,493
in all this time.

1248
02:18:09,773 --> 02:18:11,413
I'm grateful to you...

1249
02:18:14,053 --> 02:18:20,373
because you've reminded me

1250
02:18:20,533 --> 02:18:26,213
why I've encased my heart in iron,
just like this body.

1251
02:18:30,973 --> 02:18:36,053
You've reminded me
why I will never love anyone.

1252
02:18:38,733 --> 02:18:41,853
Why I hate women.

1253
02:18:42,533 --> 02:18:44,693
Why I hate them.

1254
02:18:49,053 --> 02:18:55,933
You will... die... with those Turks.

1255
02:18:58,373 --> 02:19:03,333
I will kill you, too,
like I killed your father.

1256
02:19:43,333 --> 02:19:44,653
Commander!

1257
02:19:49,373 --> 02:19:50,893
Lock up this room.

1258
02:19:51,173 --> 02:19:55,253
Nobody must ever get inside.
Do you understand me?

1259
02:19:55,333 --> 02:19:56,173
Yes, sir.

1260
02:20:11,733 --> 02:20:14,733
Everyone must keep their hands open.
Don't put them together.

1261
02:20:21,893 --> 02:20:25,253
We ask forgiveness for all our sins.

1262
02:21:15,813 --> 02:21:18,173
Hafsa Hatun, daughter of Andros.

1263
02:21:19,133 --> 02:21:26,013
Do you take Bamsi, son of Altuğ,
as your husband...

1264
02:21:27,453 --> 02:21:29,573
in return for ten gold dirhams?

1265
02:21:30,093 --> 02:21:31,173
I do.

1266
02:21:32,613 --> 02:21:34,893
-Do you?

1267
02:21:36,093 --> 02:21:37,293
Do you?

I do.

1269
02:21:45,773 --> 02:21:46,973
Bamsi, son of Altuğ.

1270
02:21:48,093 --> 02:21:52,253
Do you take Hafsa,
daughter of Andros, as your wife,

1271

1274
02:22:03,733 --> 02:22:04,773
Do you?

1275
02:22:08,373 --> 02:22:09,373
I do.

1276
02:22:15,213 --> 02:22:18,333
Witnesses, do you witness this?

1277
02:22:18,813 --> 02:22:19,693
We do.

1278
02:22:24,213 --> 02:22:31,173
I now pronounce you man and wife
in front of everyone here.

1279
02:22:32,893 --> 02:22:34,853
May God bless your marriage.

1280
02:22:35,773 --> 02:22:36,773
Amen.

1281
02:22:36,893 --> 02:22:37,773
Amen.

1282
02:22:45,533 --> 02:22:50,853
Dear God... we witness the marriage
of these two children of ours.

1283
02:22:51,573 --> 02:22:52,973
May you witness it, too.

1284
02:22:53,813 --> 02:22:56,893
Dear God, bless this marriage.

1285
02:22:57,293 --> 02:22:58,333

Amen.

1287

what Adam and Eve had;

1292
02:23:15,973 --> 02:23:21,813
what Mohammed, the Great Prophet
and Mother Hatice had;

1293
02:23:22,373 --> 02:23:27,053
what Ali and Fatıma had:

1294
02:23:27,413 --> 02:23:29,933

Brother.

Thank you, brother. Thank you.

1312
02:25:24,613 --> 02:25:25,853

1313
02:25:29,173 --> 02:25:31,013
-Mother.
-Son.

02:25:33,933 --> 02:25:35,253
I hope you'll be very happy.

1315
02:25:36,533 --> 02:25:37,533
Mother.

1316
02:25:38,093 --> 02:25:39,293

Be happy.

1323
02:26:10,133 --> 02:26:12,533
Thank you, sister. Thank you.

1324
02:30:03,039 --> 02:30:05,119
Mother, are you okay?

1325
02:30:07,879 --> 02:30:12,199
Dündar didn't come to the wedding.

1326
02:30:14,199 --> 02:30:15,919
What else can I say?

1327
02:30:44,919 --> 02:30:47,119
Forgive me for what I've done.

1328
02:31:37,439 --> 02:31:41,799
What has Bamsi Alp done?

1329
02:31:42,159 --> 02:31:46,719
He has set up his tent on the grass
under the sky!

1330
02:31:47,159 --> 02:31:52,079
What has he done
to make his beloved happy?

1331
02:31:52,199 --> 02:31:57,999
He has made a stallion out of a horse,
a ram out of a sheep.

1332
02:31:58,079 --> 02:32:00,839
Did he break hearts?

1333
02:32:01,439 --> 02:32:05,519
Did he say anything wrong?

1334
02:32:05,759 --> 02:32:09,599
He didn't break a heart
or say anything wrong.

1335
02:32:09,679 --> 02:32:11,279
He got married instead!

1336
02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:16,159
Off the lovebirds go to the bridal tent
to conclude the marriage!

1337
02:32:16,399 --> 02:32:21,799
Then may God make them happy ever after!

1338
02:32:21,879 --> 02:32:23,999
Amen!

1339
02:32:27,319 --> 02:32:29,879
May God make you happy, brother.

1340
02:32:31,439 --> 02:32:33,319
Go, go, go!
