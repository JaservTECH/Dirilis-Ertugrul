00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 68 will start after 12:12 min.

12:39.516 --> 12:42.156
I come in peace, Ertuğrul Bey.

12:43.076 --> 12:47.276
I've found out who made the attempt
on your family's lives and on my market.

12:56.556 --> 12:58.676
I'm handing her over to you.

13:15.716 --> 13:18.196
What did you want from my baby!

13:21.916 --> 13:25.116
We'll find out. We'll find out.

13:32.196 --> 13:34.196
If you tell them, I'll kill you.

13:38.476 --> 13:41.076
If you don't, you'll live. Got it?

13:43.916 --> 13:44.756
Ural Bey.

13:47.036 --> 13:48.836
It's against our tradition to harm people,

13:49.236 --> 13:51.916
especially women,
no matter how guilty they appear,

13:52.956 --> 13:53.876
without a trial.

13:56.396 --> 13:57.316
I know, Ertuğrul Bey.

13:58.676 --> 14:00.756
I couldn't restrain myself.

14:01.876 --> 14:02.716
My apologies.

14:12.276 --> 14:15.516
-Abdurrahman!
-Yes, sir.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.556
Take her to the tent.

14:23.996 --> 14:24.836
Up!

14:41.916 --> 14:44.916
Maria says she saw this woman
talking to Francisco.

14:47.076 --> 14:51.516
If you knew who the culprits were,
why didn't you talk before now, Simon?

14:52.756 --> 14:55.196
I took action as soon
as I found out about it.

14:58.156 --> 15:01.756
You Turks wouldn't believe a Christian
even if he told the truth, anyway.

15:07.596 --> 15:10.036
We Turks trust any valiant man.

15:14.316 --> 15:17.476
I hope you don't let this opportunity
slip through your fingers, Ertuğrul Bey.

15:57.196 --> 15:58.036
Ural Bey.

16:11.956 --> 16:12.836
Bey.

16:13.876 --> 16:17.516
I saw them dragging Amanda through the
market and followed them. What happened?

16:17.916 --> 16:19.796
Ertuğrul took her in for interrogation.

16:20.796 --> 16:23.316
-If she talks, we're done for.
-Don't worry, she won't.

16:23.716 --> 16:24.836
I'll kill her if she does.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.196
But Simon...

16:27.836 --> 16:31.996
His time is up. I've had enough of him.
I'm going to kill him.

16:37.516 --> 16:41.836
Who did this to our people?
Who is behind those bandits?

16:49.556 --> 16:50.516
Talk.

17:00.516 --> 17:05.156
Even a child would know you have
more enemies than friends here.

17:05.676 --> 17:08.156
Bey, don't let this devil talk anymore.

17:09.516 --> 17:10.476
You have a point.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.236
Our enemies are many.

17:13.676 --> 17:15.756
While friends are few in this lion’s den.

17:16.636 --> 17:20.636
But if you could give us
just one name, it'd suffice.

17:34.036 --> 17:36.836
I told Aliyar Bey all I know.

17:37.516 --> 17:43.236
If you knew about Francisco,
then you must also know who he worked for.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.516
Speak, you snake!

17:54.356 --> 17:58.676
If you don't tell us who
was responsible,

17:59.596 --> 18:02.476
you'll not leave here alive,
do you understand?

18:06.676 --> 18:07.596
I...

18:08.316 --> 18:10.716
I said I suspected Francisco.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.156
And you were right.

18:14.916 --> 18:15.876
Now,

18:16.796 --> 18:18.476
tell us who Francisco worked for.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.756
Who do you suspect? Tell us.

18:40.036 --> 18:40.996
Simon.

18:48.996 --> 18:50.396
Simon is a clever man.

18:52.036 --> 18:55.956
He knows we'd take his head
if he were to touch our women.

19:05.076 --> 19:08.276
You asked me who I suspected,
and I told you.

19:11.716 --> 19:15.836
If he did do it, why on earth
would he hand you over to us?

19:23.916 --> 19:24.836
Simon...

19:27.116 --> 19:28.076
Who else?

19:34.316 --> 19:35.996
His sister Maria...

19:37.236 --> 19:39.836
She said she saw you
and Francisco talking at your stall.

19:45.436 --> 19:49.356
All are welcome at my stall, sir.

19:49.836 --> 19:51.436
I can't choose my customers.

19:51.836 --> 19:54.756
Do you suspect everyone that comes
to your stall might be bandits?

20:01.396 --> 20:02.796
I said it could be Simon, sir.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.356
So why would he hand you over to us?

20:12.156 --> 20:14.196
To put himself in the clear.

20:17.476 --> 20:19.396
I did you a favor, sir.

20:20.276 --> 20:23.356
Again with the favors.
Why are you letting her speak?

20:27.636 --> 20:29.156
She will talk, Halime Hatun.

20:31.756 --> 20:32.716
She will talk.

20:34.556 --> 20:36.956
She will tell us who was behind it.

20:38.716 --> 20:42.196
Or else she'll spend the rest of her life

20:44.036 --> 20:45.636
in the cage.

20:47.796 --> 20:49.276
Sir...

20:57.756 --> 20:58.716
Brother!

21:05.076 --> 21:06.676
Get off me! Get off!

21:07.356 --> 21:08.676
Let me kill her!

21:09.076 --> 21:11.516
-She tried to kill my sister!
-Brother.

21:12.516 --> 21:13.476
Stop!

21:16.596 --> 21:17.556
Ural!

21:28.756 --> 21:30.596
-Abdurrahman.
-Yes, sir.

21:31.276 --> 21:32.476
Take her to the cage.

21:33.516 --> 21:34.436
Yes, sir.

21:36.356 --> 21:37.516
Up!

21:53.836 --> 21:58.236
That sly woman won't talk
just because you lock her up.

21:59.356 --> 22:00.596
What do you suggest?

22:01.516 --> 22:04.036
We can't torture a woman
to make her talk, can we?

22:06.756 --> 22:08.596
I'll deal with
her interrogation personally.

22:09.356 --> 22:11.396
I'll let you know as soon as
I find out something.

22:12.396 --> 22:15.556
I hope you can make that snake talk.

22:16.716 --> 22:18.036
May God protect you.

22:19.356 --> 22:22.196
-We'll await your news.
-Candar Bey.

22:23.636 --> 22:24.836
I forgot to tell you.

22:25.756 --> 22:30.236
Tomorrow evening, we are going
to gather to mark the safe return

22:30.356 --> 22:31.716
of our women and my son.

22:32.276 --> 22:33.356
You are very welcome.

22:33.756 --> 22:35.876
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey. Thank you.

22:36.916 --> 22:41.756
We keep talking about our traditions.

22:44.876 --> 22:48.396
But when push comes to shove,
we forget about them.

23:19.756 --> 23:21.156
We made our move.

23:22.516 --> 23:25.116
Let's see how Ural deals with it.

23:26.756 --> 23:29.196
Ural and his wife were panicking.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.236
You should've seen their faces.

23:32.596 --> 23:33.916
Now the game begins.

23:35.916 --> 23:38.196
We deserve a feast, right?

23:46.836 --> 23:48.116
Look at them, Philip.

23:49.356 --> 23:53.476
Our lands have been invaded by
a bunch of shepherds and their goats.

23:54.716 --> 23:56.676
And now they're riding
their horses before us.

24:00.476 --> 24:01.916
How did we lose to them?

24:04.516 --> 24:05.476
How?

24:48.436 --> 24:49.396
Innkeeper Simon...

24:50.476 --> 24:52.956
He wouldn't give his dying father
so much as a cup of water.

24:53.756 --> 24:55.836
Why would he do us this favor?

24:58.076 --> 25:00.316
She's right, sir.

25:01.276 --> 25:04.196
The devil never helps
without expecting something in return.

25:08.316 --> 25:10.316
What's Simon's objective, son?

25:11.236 --> 25:14.276
And more importantly,
what will our next move be?

25:20.596 --> 25:22.436
I'm going to set Amanda free.

25:28.756 --> 25:33.196
If you set a dog free, it'll surely
go running back to its master.

25:53.516 --> 25:54.436
Talk!

25:55.516 --> 25:58.356
-Who's behind it?
-I'm innocent.

25:59.316 --> 26:00.756
I just wanted to help...

26:16.836 --> 26:19.156
Did you really think I'd believe that?

26:20.156 --> 26:23.676
Who's behind the bandit?
Who made you do it?

26:24.716 --> 26:26.276
I've told you all I know.

26:31.196 --> 26:32.556
I've got time.

26:33.036 --> 26:36.356
Speak whenever you feel like it.

26:49.076 --> 26:51.196
We got our Bey and our women
back safe and sound.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.236
Thank God.

26:59.276 --> 27:03.076
If only Tugtekin Bey and Gokce Hatun
could have made it back alive as well...

27:08.916 --> 27:10.636
I still have nightmares about it.

27:13.116 --> 27:15.236
I can't forget that damn day.

27:24.516 --> 27:25.916
Sir!

27:27.156 --> 27:28.116
Sir!

27:55.676 --> 27:58.076
I miss my master, brother.

28:05.196 --> 28:06.956
They've become martyrs, brother.

28:07.956 --> 28:09.276
Such an honor...

28:10.836 --> 28:13.636
May God allow us as honorable a death.

28:17.676 --> 28:18.996
Amen, brother.

28:54.316 --> 28:56.276
She'll talk, sir, she'll talk.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.996
I'll make her talk before sunset.

29:04.836 --> 29:08.356
I'm innocent. Believe me, please.

29:30.916 --> 29:32.436
I know you're innocent, woman.

29:34.356 --> 29:35.196
Sir?

29:36.716 --> 29:37.636
She's telling the truth.

29:41.156 --> 29:43.236
How can you believe her?

29:44.556 --> 29:46.076
Because she's telling the truth.

29:50.036 --> 29:53.836
Amanda is innocent. Simon is behind it.

29:56.556 --> 30:02.156
They came in so suddenly
and dragged me here, sir.

30:03.396 --> 30:05.396
I didn't understand what was happening.

30:07.716 --> 30:08.676
It's Simon.

30:09.716 --> 30:12.436
He thought no one would suspect him
if he was the one to give you up.

30:17.156 --> 30:18.356
You are free to go.

30:20.316 --> 30:22.036
Halime Sultan will send you away.

30:38.276 --> 30:39.276
Ertuğrul Bey...

30:42.476 --> 30:44.596
You are a just and brave man.

30:54.356 --> 30:58.996
{\an8}CAVDAR TRIBE

31:04.676 --> 31:07.476
Foals grow, steeds rest.

31:08.796 --> 31:11.396
Sons grow, elders rest.

31:13.156 --> 31:15.316
This is how I've always wanted you to be.

31:16.236 --> 31:20.556
When my time is up
and I leave this transitory life behind,

31:21.556 --> 31:23.356
I don't want to have any regrets.

31:25.036 --> 31:29.396
I want to know that my sons act in unison.

31:32.116 --> 31:34.876
Rest assured, Father.

31:36.036 --> 31:39.356
We live for our tribe.

31:40.396 --> 31:43.156
We work to glorify our tribe.

31:43.716 --> 31:48.316
I didn't believe them when they said
my brother's sword was like a dragon.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.996
Then I saw it. And believed.

31:54.036 --> 31:55.716
Like Ertuğrul Bey says,

31:56.956 --> 32:01.356
if it weren't for Ural, we wouldn't
have been able to save our women.

32:07.076 --> 32:11.436
What were you talking about
with Emir Sadettin, son?

32:12.156 --> 32:13.116
You didn't tell me.

32:13.956 --> 32:16.676
Emir Sadettin Köpek is going to give

32:17.076 --> 32:19.916
the lands up to Enguruk to us.

32:24.436 --> 32:25.396
Son,

32:26.276 --> 32:29.636
I've known the man for over 30 years.

32:30.636 --> 32:32.756
We fought together in Harput.

32:34.076 --> 32:38.436
The Emir Kopek I know
would never give away his land.

32:39.116 --> 32:40.156
But he'd take land.

32:41.156 --> 32:44.356
His rule doesn't extend beyond
the walls of Konya Palace.

32:45.036 --> 32:46.596
He needs us here.

32:49.316 --> 32:50.756
That hand...

32:51.956 --> 32:54.076
toppled the great Celaleddin Karatay.

32:54.796 --> 32:57.796
The Emir hides his intentions
even from himself.

32:58.916 --> 33:01.996
We're talking about the man
who is right below the Sultan.

33:02.716 --> 33:04.116
I don't know his intentions.

33:04.636 --> 33:08.316
But if the Seljuks want to
get a hold of these lands,

33:08.956 --> 33:10.556
they'll need our tribe.

33:11.276 --> 33:14.716
Emir Sadettin Köpek has no choice
but to support us!

33:15.036 --> 33:17.156
Which tribe has more men than us, Father?

33:19.436 --> 33:20.636
-Son--
-Father.

33:21.076 --> 33:23.356
We need a lifeline
in these fierce currents.

33:24.196 --> 33:27.316
Emir Sadettin Köpek
is going to provide us with it.

33:46.580 --> 33:49.100
Prepare the horses,
I'll collapse the inn around Simon.

33:50.900 --> 33:51.940
Yes, sir.

33:58.900 --> 34:00.580
Simon showed his last hand.

34:01.460 --> 34:03.820
First the knife, and now this.

34:04.620 --> 34:06.660
One of us has to die, it's the only way.

34:07.820 --> 34:09.780
How will you explain this to your father?

34:10.540 --> 34:11.500
I'll tell him that...

34:12.220 --> 34:14.500
I found out it was Simon
that killed Toktamış.

34:15.620 --> 34:18.500
Besides, Maria prepared the poison,
and the evidence is there.

34:18.700 --> 34:19.900
I'll have him believe me.

34:20.620 --> 34:22.220
One of us dies.

34:23.100 --> 34:24.580
There's no time to lose.

34:29.180 --> 34:31.820
{\an8}KAYI TRIBE

34:48.860 --> 34:51.700
We owe her the lives of all our sons.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.820
Tend to our guest, Halime Sultan.

34:55.020 --> 34:56.900
I understand. Here.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.020
I'm overjoyed to see you alive and well.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.700
Apologies for not believing you.

35:28.580 --> 35:30.620
Thanks to you, I got my son back as well.

35:31.980 --> 35:33.420
May God be with you.

35:34.820 --> 35:37.340
Let's head to the healing tent
and have Ishak tend to your wounds.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.980
Thank you, I'm alright.

35:40.620 --> 35:42.220
It'd be best if I left now.

35:43.180 --> 35:46.420
Wouldn't you like to drink a cup of <i>ayran</i>
while we prepare the horse?

35:46.740 --> 35:47.620
Come.

35:50.540 --> 35:51.460
Kaya.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.140
Take three alps with you.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.300
Follow Amanda.

35:56.540 --> 35:57.660
Yes, sir.

35:58.940 --> 36:00.300
You'll go to the market.

36:00.380 --> 36:01.820
Tell me if you see Turgut.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.420
I want to know every step Amanda takes.

36:04.700 --> 36:05.700
Yes, sir.

36:10.620 --> 36:12.100
-Artuk Bey.
-Yes, sir?

36:12.620 --> 36:14.220
Prepare 20 men.

36:15.180 --> 36:17.740
-I'll talk to them before the meeting.
-As you wish, sir.

36:17.900 --> 36:18.940
I'm coming too, brother.

36:22.060 --> 36:24.260
Think I got rusty, boy?

36:25.020 --> 36:26.020
Of course you're coming.

36:26.540 --> 36:27.780
You are an alp.

36:28.260 --> 36:29.460
You must come.

36:55.820 --> 36:57.340
Why did they let her go?

37:02.580 --> 37:03.540
They freed her.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.060
Let's go.

39:07.820 --> 39:08.700
Go back now.

39:09.260 --> 39:10.140
Sir.

39:15.940 --> 39:16.900
Men!

39:43.060 --> 39:44.220
Aktolgali.

39:45.900 --> 39:50.100
In peace, you're my brother,
in war, my comrade.

39:51.980 --> 39:52.940
Half the time...

39:54.060 --> 39:55.740
we breeze through the Steppes.

39:57.140 --> 39:58.180
The rest of the time...

39:58.820 --> 40:01.300
we put an end to our foes.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.740
We drank from every spring.

40:06.660 --> 40:08.340
We set foot on every piece of land.

40:09.940 --> 40:12.060
We hunted every game there is.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.780
I miss those carefree days.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.700
Who knew it'd be this hard?

40:25.460 --> 40:28.300
I shoulder the holy mission
I received from my father,

40:28.860 --> 40:30.180
Suleyman Shah.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.380
The enemy are hard on our backs.

40:36.180 --> 40:39.500
Enough of this mess that
rusted my sword, Aktolgali.

40:42.500 --> 40:47.060
I've come to miss enemies
that I could fight properly.

40:48.980 --> 40:49.940
Now,

40:51.340 --> 40:52.500
I must steel my nerves,

40:53.580 --> 40:55.300
and with my foes as the hammer,

40:57.540 --> 40:59.060
I must get stronger

40:59.980 --> 41:04.260
with every hit, and become sharp enough
to cut their throats.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.620
Now, my sword shall become my path,

41:09.460 --> 41:10.620
Mother Earth, my blanket,

41:11.780 --> 41:14.020
and the heavens, my confidant.

41:16.260 --> 41:18.140
Bask in my glory, Aktolgali.

41:20.260 --> 41:22.260
I, Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah,

41:23.740 --> 41:25.740
before taking my revenge,

41:27.180 --> 41:28.940
before I light up the hopes of my people,

41:30.260 --> 41:32.700
before I do right by my tribe,
shall not die.

42:03.660 --> 42:07.140
{\an8}PUBLIC MARKET

42:19.420 --> 42:20.820
Come, sit with us, Bartalmay.

42:21.460 --> 42:23.420
I'd hate to offend you, Master Simon.

42:30.580 --> 42:33.420
I'm overjoyed today. Come, eat with us.

42:43.860 --> 42:47.700
To what do I owe this honor, Master Simon?

42:57.900 --> 43:02.340
We owe it to the war Ertuğrul shall soon
wage on the Cavdars.

43:10.060 --> 43:11.780
The Kayis might be a small tribe,

43:11.980 --> 43:15.180
but Ertuğrul's men will not yield
to the Cavdars easily.

43:19.220 --> 43:21.420
Who wants them to yield, anyway?

43:26.140 --> 43:29.660
Let the lot of them wipe
each other off the face of the world.

43:32.100 --> 43:35.340
We'll keep trading with both tribes.

43:37.900 --> 43:38.860
Amanda.

43:39.580 --> 43:41.020
At last she was good for something.

43:46.820 --> 43:49.660
Speaking of trades,
excuse me, Master Simon.

43:50.020 --> 43:51.340
I shall head for the market.

43:55.940 --> 43:57.300
Goodbye, Merchant Hasan.

44:31.860 --> 44:34.420
-Check out my colorful clothes!
-Spice seller is here.

44:34.500 --> 44:36.580
Come, see my silk clothes.

44:36.860 --> 44:38.660
How much is it?

44:40.100 --> 44:42.020
-Take...
-Right away, sir.

44:44.420 --> 44:45.700
Beautiful clothes.

44:51.460 --> 44:53.300
Boy, can you give me a hand?

44:57.300 --> 44:59.820
Spice seller is here.
Who wants some spice?

45:18.580 --> 45:19.540
What's it, Samsa?

45:19.780 --> 45:22.300
Ertuğrul Bey let Amanda go.

45:23.780 --> 45:26.380
He wants to know who she
works with, and why.

45:26.900 --> 45:28.860
If she comes here to talk to anyone

45:29.700 --> 45:31.100
he said he wanted to know.

45:35.540 --> 45:36.500
Okay.

46:12.180 --> 46:13.140
You're back early.

46:16.700 --> 46:18.620
-Turgut...
-What about Turgut?

46:20.420 --> 46:21.900
Met with an alp from Kayis.

46:22.540 --> 46:24.340
Ertuğrul let Amanda go, apparently.

46:24.940 --> 46:26.260
And she's being followed.

46:26.620 --> 46:29.060
He had Turgut watch Amanda.

46:51.380 --> 46:53.620
And you said you'd know
if he left the room, huh?

46:54.020 --> 46:57.020
He's been playing us
from the very beginning!

46:57.420 --> 46:59.780
Did his bed keep you that warm?

47:16.660 --> 47:18.620
So we were ambushed by him as well.

47:19.180 --> 47:20.140
Damn it!

47:20.540 --> 47:21.980
Turgut knows everything.

47:22.420 --> 47:26.860
The secret passage, the letter Sadettin
Kopek sent us, everything!

47:27.180 --> 47:28.820
It's all upside down again!

47:29.020 --> 47:30.020
Allow me to...

47:31.500 --> 47:33.380
Ertuğrul was a step ahead of us.

47:33.940 --> 47:35.740
So it was thanks to Turgut.

47:36.700 --> 47:39.620
We'll be in danger as long as
that traitor lives, Master Simon.

47:40.460 --> 47:41.420
Allow me to

47:41.700 --> 47:44.620
cut out his heart and give it to you.

47:44.860 --> 47:45.820
No, Philip.

47:46.780 --> 47:49.060
I'll have Turgut do one last thing for us.

47:52.620 --> 47:53.940
He'll kill Ertuğrul.

48:21.420 --> 48:24.180
It's obvious that
she's waiting for someone.

48:40.180 --> 48:41.140
Ural.

48:45.620 --> 48:46.580
Ural.

48:52.420 --> 48:53.580
Ural Bey.

48:54.540 --> 48:56.780
What are you out here for?
How did you get away?

48:56.900 --> 48:58.940
I didn't, he let me go.

48:59.420 --> 49:00.820
He was fooled by our plan.

49:02.980 --> 49:03.940
Come with me.

49:08.180 --> 49:10.300
Come here.

49:11.700 --> 49:12.980
You fool!

49:13.940 --> 49:15.700
Ertuğrul used you as bait.

49:15.860 --> 49:18.540
Would he let you go if he didn't know
you'd come to me?

49:18.660 --> 49:21.980
No, Ural. He thinks it was Simon.

49:22.500 --> 49:23.660
Let him.

49:25.060 --> 49:27.860
I'm not leaving it to chance.

49:51.380 --> 49:52.340
Batuhan!

49:56.060 --> 49:58.340
Ertuğrul must have sent men
to follow her.

49:58.540 --> 50:02.380
No one can know Amanda came
to see me. Send your men to search around.

50:03.020 --> 50:04.340
Let's go back to the settlement.

50:06.620 --> 50:07.580
There they are!

50:08.780 --> 50:10.780
Don't let them go!

50:11.220 --> 50:12.180
You wait here.

50:36.860 --> 50:38.860
Let's go!

51:27.380 --> 51:28.540
My brothers!

53:17.220 --> 53:20.420
It's done. Don't leave our dead behind.
Be quick.

53:52.260 --> 53:54.020
-We got rid of them, sir.
-Good.

53:55.140 --> 53:58.100
Get ready, we'll be at the inn
when the sun sets.

54:09.980 --> 54:10.940
<i>God, give me strength!</i>

55:21.780 --> 55:24.940
Oh, how I love you, my darling.

55:26.020 --> 55:28.100
God answered our prayers.

55:28.820 --> 55:30.660
He spared us our son.

55:32.540 --> 55:35.060
What would I do if something
happened to you?

55:37.140 --> 55:38.940
Don't think about it, Halime Sultan.

55:40.180 --> 55:42.020
What would our son do without you?

55:46.780 --> 55:48.140
I wouldn't know.

55:50.660 --> 55:52.900
I've never heard you say that, though.

55:56.660 --> 55:59.860
Besides, it's common practice among men
to find a second wife.

56:01.820 --> 56:03.340
I know my wife well enough

56:04.020 --> 56:05.820
to know when she's implying something.

56:05.940 --> 56:07.700
I'm not implying anything.

56:08.020 --> 56:08.980
Why would I do that?

56:12.580 --> 56:14.140
If I disappeared,

56:14.700 --> 56:15.980
you'd just get another woman,

56:16.500 --> 56:18.860
and have her nurture Gündüz.
Did you think I'd say this?

56:25.580 --> 56:26.820
Who knows?

56:28.660 --> 56:32.500
However, you seem to be enjoying
the idea of it.

56:33.980 --> 56:34.940
They say a man

56:35.500 --> 56:37.500
can survive the strike of his enemy,

56:38.060 --> 56:40.100
but not the cruelty of his wife.

56:43.940 --> 56:44.900
Who knows?

56:46.660 --> 56:48.260
Maybe you'll even get a woman

56:48.980 --> 56:50.780
while I'm alive and well.

56:53.980 --> 56:56.620
After all, women from other tribes
are eyeing you.

57:17.700 --> 57:19.140
Expect no charity from the strangers.

57:21.100 --> 57:22.820
Lean on support from no one but

57:23.540 --> 57:24.540
your own kin.

57:27.420 --> 57:29.180
Only death may part those

57:29.780 --> 57:31.380
of the same blood.

57:33.300 --> 57:34.660
I have decided.

57:35.740 --> 57:37.500
I'll have Aslıhan bind us

57:38.220 --> 57:40.820
with the Kayi inseparably.

57:41.060 --> 57:42.500
Well thought, father.

57:43.100 --> 57:44.780
I'm sure my sister would be happy to marry

57:45.420 --> 57:46.460
a brave

57:47.100 --> 57:48.060
and valiant warrior

57:48.420 --> 57:50.620
from the Kayi Tribe.

57:52.620 --> 57:54.700
I'll talk this over with Aslıhan.

57:56.380 --> 57:58.860
Who will you have her marry, father?

57:59.660 --> 58:00.660
Dündar Bey?

58:05.860 --> 58:06.820
No, Ertuğrul Bey.

58:12.540 --> 58:13.540
What?

58:15.820 --> 58:17.140
Yes, with Ertuğrul Bey.

58:18.580 --> 58:20.140
Ertuğrul is a true Kayi.

58:21.180 --> 58:22.260
Father, alright, but...

58:23.020 --> 58:24.460
Ertuğrul Bey is already married.

58:25.380 --> 58:26.900
Not to mention his children.

58:27.660 --> 58:28.620
I know.

58:29.780 --> 58:32.260
His first wife is the niece
of Sultan Alaeddin.

58:39.860 --> 58:40.820
My sister...

58:43.580 --> 58:45.700
Do you think she'd accept that?

58:46.020 --> 58:46.980
I'll talk to her.

58:48.620 --> 58:49.740
However...

58:51.100 --> 58:53.780
Ertuğrul Bey is no ordinary man.

58:54.700 --> 58:56.580
It's up to you, father.

58:58.020 --> 58:58.980
However,

58:59.500 --> 59:01.580
Dündar Bey is a son of
Suleyman Shah as well.

59:02.260 --> 59:03.220
He's not married either.

59:05.500 --> 59:07.180
They call Dündar a bey

59:08.300 --> 59:09.820
because Ertuğrul is a bey.

59:10.900 --> 59:12.780
Ertuğrul is much too young.

59:13.740 --> 59:16.820
He'll be the head of the Kayi
for years to come.

59:18.180 --> 59:20.300
We can't wait for Dündar to be the head

59:21.620 --> 59:24.260
of Kayis to get a hold of their tribe.

59:28.740 --> 59:29.940
It's up to you, father.

59:33.820 --> 59:34.780
However...

59:36.380 --> 59:37.380
what would my brother say?

59:38.860 --> 59:41.100
It's no secret that they don't
get along well.

59:42.380 --> 59:43.540
With this marriage,

59:44.500 --> 59:48.620
Ural shall obtain the glory and power
he's been after.

59:50.020 --> 59:52.620
I'm sure he'll support the idea.

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.620
Still no news from Amanda?

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:31.180
Let's hope she was dumb enough
to go to Ural.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:32.980
Ural would kill her.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.420
What's important is that Ertuğrul
finds out who she meets.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:40.940
That's all that matters.

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.700
Batuhan.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.740
Hold the door with your men.

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:55.420
Let no one in.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.540
Amanda is dead.

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.100
Found with three other bodies.

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:48.380
Looks like Kayi soldiers,
Master Simon.

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.940
Ural...

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.860
It's your last supper, Simon.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.660
Eat. Don't die hungry.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.100
Such an emotional man you are, Ural.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.820
What were you lead to believe again, huh?

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.180
Did you think you could make us fight

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.780
with Ertuğrul by giving him

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.900
Amanda?

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:10.380
How could I make Ertuğrul
fight you by giving him Amanda?

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.500
I don't understand.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.380
Enough!

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.180
Hold!

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.580
His Highness Abu Nakkas.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.540
I hope I'm not interrupting
as you kill each other.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:01.780
Get out.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.940
-What's this, Maria?
-Come with me.

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.580
While you are fighting among yourselves

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:07.580
Sultan Alaeddin is planning on
allowing Ertuğrul to rule

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.580
the lands as far as Engurek.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:12.580
While Karacahisar and the keep

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.980
are still in the hands of the Byzantines?

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.100
The Sultan

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:19.100
is not aware how big of a mistake
he's making.

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.860
Ertuğrul is but a speck of dust, sir.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.740
However strong he might be,

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.900
he can't possibly imagine
invading Karacahisar with

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.300
a mere 400 tents.

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:31.980
Ertuğrul

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.460
is but a pebble

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.700
among these huge rocks.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.540
Even a pebble could defeat a man,
as they say.

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:49.740
You keep making wrong decisions, Ural.

01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:52.900
Instead of going after futile things,

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:55.420
strive to become the head of your tribe.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.500
There will be time for that, sir.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.580
I'll soon take over the Cavdar tribe.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.940
At this rate, you'll soon
take your last breath.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.060
The Seljuks

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:18.020
and I need

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:19.780
strong tribe leaders.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.380
The man that stands before me,
unable to lead his tribe,

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.300
dares to expect to rule these vast lands?

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:39.540
Simon.

01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.460
You'll do what I say.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.620
Or else Ertuğrul

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.020
will bury you alive along with
your precious market.

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.340
And you'll roll with it.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.660
Rest assured, sir.

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:56.060
I've already signed his death warrant.

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.900
Why is Batuhan here?

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.100
I thought Simon owned the inn.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.100
I don't want you to get hurt.

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:27.980
Ural Bey is here.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.460
Just another fight over money.

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:44.980
Don't leave this room.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:19.300
-Did you let the alps know, Artuk Bey?
-They are awaiting your orders, sir.

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:27.620
-Sir.
-What is it, Abdur Rahman?

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:29.700
Sir.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.380
Kaya.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.460
Son!

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.300
Lad! Son!

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:40.060
Lad!

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:43.700
Son!

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:45.220
Son.

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:49.580
I bear witness that
there is no god but Allah

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:55.860
and that Muhammad is
his servant and messenger.

01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:57.740
Kaya!

01:08:57.940 --> 01:08:58.900
Lad.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.620
Who did this to you?

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.220
Who?

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:07.260
Kaya.

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.820
Kaya!

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.580
Kaya!

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:56.260
Sir, Ural Bey gets little done,
but hurls abuse constantly.

01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:00.780
He'd have killed Ertuğrul
many times over, if it was up to him.

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.460
I hope you don't end up like him.

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:06.780
Don't you worry, sir.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:11.540
You'll hear of his death
by tomorrow if you stay here.

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:16.580
It's not that I'm asking for
the death of a Turkmen bey.

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:23.660
However, there is no predicting
who meets the grim reaper.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.020
All I care about is

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:37.140
the safety of the Seljuks,

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.740
the comfort and fortune of my people.

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:42.860
Every emir would want

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:45.900
that everything in his country

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.580
is resolved quietly and discreetly.

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:11.180
Quietly.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:12.860
Discreetly.

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:21.220
Your death will be quiet
and discreet, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.260
Quiet.

01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.020
Discreet.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:35.700
The Sultan must know about
the spy at the palace.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.740
Give this letter to Alfonso, Philip.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:41.500
He leaves tomorrow.

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:50.820
Alfonso.

01:17:15.489 --> 01:17:18.049
Kaya Alp paid for what he heard.

01:17:19.729 --> 01:17:21.129
That woman, Amanda,

01:17:21.569 --> 01:17:23.529
must have met her maker...

01:17:24.409 --> 01:17:26.449
since they left no witnesses.

01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:31.409
God has witnessed it all, Artuk Bey.

01:17:32.049 --> 01:17:36.209
The one behind all this
will be sure to meet my blade.

01:17:46.489 --> 01:17:47.449
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

01:17:47.649 --> 01:17:49.409
<i>-Alaikum salaam.</i>
<i>-Alaikum salaam.</i>

01:17:59.849 --> 01:18:04.129
<i>I seek refuge in Allah</i>
<i>from the cursed Satan</i>

01:18:05.249 --> 01:18:09.129
<i>In the name of Allah</i>
<i>The beneficent, the merciful</i>

01:18:12.609 --> 01:18:14.809
<i>By the wise Qur'an</i>

01:18:15.089 --> 01:18:17.569
<i>Your people are the messengers</i>

01:18:17.889 --> 01:18:21.049
<i>On a straight path</i>

01:18:21.609 --> 01:18:27.569
<i>This is a revelation of the Exalted</i>
<i>In Might, the Merciful</i>

01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:31.289
<i>That you may warn them</i>
<i>Whose forefathers were not warned</i>

01:18:31.369 --> 01:18:33.569
<i>So they are unaware</i>

01:18:52.609 --> 01:18:53.569
Permission, father.

01:18:55.889 --> 01:18:57.089
Come here, my daughter.

01:18:58.649 --> 01:18:59.609
Sit down.

01:19:06.529 --> 01:19:09.889
You wonder why I have called for you,
no doubt.

01:19:16.049 --> 01:19:17.569
I still remember...

01:19:19.009 --> 01:19:21.409
how I was mesmerized
when your late mother

01:19:22.529 --> 01:19:24.929
handed you to me for the first time.

01:19:26.809 --> 01:19:28.849
After two sons,

01:19:30.249 --> 01:19:32.249
when I held you

01:19:33.409 --> 01:19:34.369
it was as if

01:19:34.929 --> 01:19:36.689
a baby chick...

01:19:38.929 --> 01:19:40.249
so fragile...

01:19:42.609 --> 01:19:44.249
so tender...

01:19:50.489 --> 01:19:53.809
Time flows like water.

01:19:55.849 --> 01:19:57.169
And one day...

01:19:58.249 --> 01:19:59.529
that bird takes flight

01:20:00.289 --> 01:20:01.329
and leaves the nest.

01:20:11.529 --> 01:20:13.529
What I want to say is...

01:20:15.049 --> 01:20:18.729
I have decided that

01:20:19.689 --> 01:20:21.609
it's time for you to fly

01:20:23.409 --> 01:20:26.009
and find your own nest.

01:20:30.289 --> 01:20:31.769
It will be as you decide,

01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:33.689
Father.

01:20:41.289 --> 01:20:42.249
Traditionally...

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:47.089
it's you who decides
whether or not to marry

01:20:47.929 --> 01:20:49.569
the one I choose.

01:20:51.449 --> 01:20:52.969
I'm your father.

01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:55.329
Not your owner.

01:20:56.489 --> 01:20:58.529
Our rules don't force you.

01:21:00.329 --> 01:21:01.289
I only want

01:21:01.969 --> 01:21:02.929
the best,

01:21:03.969 --> 01:21:05.169
for you...

01:21:08.529 --> 01:21:10.609
for my sweet little girl.

01:21:23.049 --> 01:21:24.049
In short,

01:21:26.009 --> 01:21:27.329
and if you accept,

01:21:28.849 --> 01:21:32.089
I wish to betroth you to Ertuğrul Bey
of the Kayi tribe.

01:22:04.649 --> 01:22:06.009
My wish is to marry...

01:22:07.329 --> 01:22:10.289
your sister Aslıhan to Ertuğrul Bey.

01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:12.209
We were discussing.

01:22:18.089 --> 01:22:20.769
And what does Aslıhan

01:22:21.449 --> 01:22:22.769
have to say about this?

01:22:26.489 --> 01:22:27.689
Father will decide.

01:22:29.249 --> 01:22:32.329
Ertuğrul Bey is a godsend for you.

01:22:33.889 --> 01:22:38.329
I only hope your heart wishes the same,
my daughter.

01:22:43.129 --> 01:22:44.169
If you ask me,

01:22:45.809 --> 01:22:47.649
you made a good decision, father.

01:22:48.249 --> 01:22:49.209
Ertuğrul Bey...

01:22:50.169 --> 01:22:54.329
Small village but a big reputation.

01:23:02.969 --> 01:23:04.169
Excuse me, father.

01:23:07.689 --> 01:23:10.209
If you also approve...

01:23:11.889 --> 01:23:13.729
may God let this happen.

01:23:16.769 --> 01:23:17.729
<i>Inshallah.</i>

01:23:30.489 --> 01:23:32.249
After Emir Saadettin...

01:23:33.249 --> 01:23:36.689
Ertuğrul's support for us means nothing.

01:23:37.169 --> 01:23:41.289
But, one more friend and one less enemy.

01:23:43.489 --> 01:23:45.889
Everyone serves their purpose,

01:23:46.569 --> 01:23:47.529
Ural.

01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:49.889
You only met the Emir yesterday.

01:23:50.769 --> 01:23:52.969
I know his whole past.

01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:57.249
We have no friends but each other.

01:23:58.649 --> 01:24:03.169
If Ertuğrul Bey agrees
to marry your sister,

01:24:04.449 --> 01:24:07.849
this will be huge for the Cavdars.

01:24:10.289 --> 01:24:11.249
Let's hope

01:24:12.449 --> 01:24:15.129
that Ertuğrul agrees
to marry Aslıhan then.

01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:38.529
The time of death has come for those
who wish to put out the holy flame.

01:24:44.649 --> 01:24:47.329
I have come to take
the cold breath of death.

01:25:14.889 --> 01:25:17.169
Loyal servants of Christ.

01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:28.089
My silent friends.

01:25:33.409 --> 01:25:35.449
Give me the breath of Hell.

01:25:43.809 --> 01:25:45.489
Let it all smell of death.

01:25:57.929 --> 01:25:59.609
Oh, children of fire!

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:03.569
Hear the children of Olympos!

01:26:28.889 --> 01:26:30.649
I'm sending you a sibling.

01:26:32.249 --> 01:26:33.929
With a poisonous smoke.

01:27:32.849 --> 01:27:34.849
There's nothing to be ashamed of, Aslıhan.

01:27:35.569 --> 01:27:37.849
Marriage is the dream of all women.

01:27:39.409 --> 01:27:40.409
Of course it is.

01:27:42.009 --> 01:27:43.729
I know what worries you.

01:27:44.609 --> 01:27:46.809
Being the second wife confuses you.

01:27:49.209 --> 01:27:51.289
You have nothing to worry about.

01:27:52.369 --> 01:27:54.249
You're the young and firm one.

01:27:56.729 --> 01:27:59.169
Let Halime Hatun worry about herself.

01:28:00.289 --> 01:28:04.009
What will happen when her man marries
a young and beautiful girl?

01:28:06.929 --> 01:28:08.249
I have seen

01:28:09.209 --> 01:28:12.129
with my own eyes what a warrior she is.

01:28:13.409 --> 01:28:16.369
I know how loyal she is to her Bey
and her son.

01:28:17.929 --> 01:28:19.489
She'll fight you for a day,

01:28:19.929 --> 01:28:21.089
or two.

01:28:21.809 --> 01:28:23.849
But she will accept you eventually.

01:28:27.529 --> 01:28:29.209
But don't forget,

01:28:30.009 --> 01:28:32.089
if Ertuğrul Bey agrees,

01:28:32.889 --> 01:28:34.809
Halime Hatun will accept as well.

01:28:36.409 --> 01:28:38.409
Would you accept it?

01:28:40.529 --> 01:28:42.169
As long as you agree,

01:28:43.289 --> 01:28:45.289
she will too eventually.

01:28:45.609 --> 01:28:47.849
It's not like she'll go against
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:29:05.849 --> 01:29:07.769
<i>In the name of Allah,</i>

01:29:08.289 --> 01:29:11.169
<i>the most merciful, the most gracious.</i>

01:29:12.769 --> 01:29:17.209
<i>And they had made their plot,</i>
<i>but Allah had seen their plot.</i>

01:29:18.009 --> 01:29:22.489
<i>There will be only torment</i>
<i>for them and their plots.</i>

01:29:23.249 --> 01:29:27.609
<i>Even if their plan had been sufficient</i>
<i>to do away with the mountains.</i>

01:29:28.689 --> 01:29:33.329
<i>When those infidels were</i>
<i>plotting to hold you,</i>

01:29:33.609 --> 01:29:37.169
<i>kill you, exile you,</i>

01:29:37.569 --> 01:29:39.849
<i>or torment you.</i>

01:29:40.769 --> 01:29:42.369
<i>When they were plotting,</i>

01:29:42.929 --> 01:29:46.129
<i>Allah was plotting against them as well.</i>

01:29:46.929 --> 01:29:47.889
<i>It is known that</i>

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:51.129
<i>Allah only plots for the best.</i>

01:29:52.369 --> 01:29:54.569
<i>They have cheated.</i>

01:29:55.249 --> 01:29:58.049
<i>Allah has done away with their plots.</i>

01:29:58.609 --> 01:30:01.129
<i>And Allah is the best</i>

01:30:01.529 --> 01:30:03.089
<i>of planners.</i>

01:30:04.289 --> 01:30:06.569
<i>I'm apart from everything except Allah.</i>

01:30:07.409 --> 01:30:09.409
<i>Come together,</i>

01:30:09.729 --> 01:30:11.969
<i>plot all your plots against me.</i>

01:30:12.649 --> 01:30:15.049
<i>Do not delay.</i>

01:30:22.569 --> 01:30:25.649
<i>Oh, Allah, you speak so true, so well.</i>

01:30:32.089 --> 01:30:33.049
<i>My Allah,</i>

01:30:33.769 --> 01:30:35.209
<i>may you spoil the plots</i>

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:37.689
<i>against your warriors.</i>

01:30:38.729 --> 01:30:40.169
<i>Make them victorious.</i>

01:30:42.169 --> 01:30:43.129
<i>Amen.</i>

01:30:55.289 --> 01:30:56.929
<i>Allah is great.</i>

01:31:18.289 --> 01:31:20.009
<i>Allah is great.</i>

01:31:42.089 --> 01:31:43.769
<i>Allah is great.</i>

01:31:45.409 --> 01:31:47.649
<i>Peace and mercy of Allah be with you.</i>

01:31:48.249 --> 01:31:50.609
<i>Peace and mercy of Allah be with you.</i>

01:31:52.929 --> 01:31:54.929
<i>Bismillâhirrahmânirrahîm.</i>

01:33:13.169 --> 01:33:15.089
For the souls of our martyrs,

01:33:16.049 --> 01:33:18.089
<i>Al Fatiha.</i>

01:33:48.609 --> 01:33:50.209
Brave sons of Kayi.

01:33:51.369 --> 01:33:52.329
Today...

01:33:53.249 --> 01:33:54.649
we buried...

01:33:56.209 --> 01:33:57.489
another brave warrior.

01:34:00.529 --> 01:34:01.489
Witness it.

01:34:04.369 --> 01:34:05.809
Kaya Alp is a martyr.

01:34:10.889 --> 01:34:11.849
Witness it.

01:34:14.489 --> 01:34:15.609
Our cause is just,

01:34:16.809 --> 01:34:18.609
our path is hard,

01:34:19.809 --> 01:34:21.969
our enemy is treacherous.

01:34:26.089 --> 01:34:27.049
Kaya Alp.

01:34:28.649 --> 01:34:30.209
Despite the treachery of the enemy

01:34:32.249 --> 01:34:33.929
he has been buried with honor.

01:34:36.569 --> 01:34:37.529
<i>Inshallah.</i>

01:34:38.569 --> 01:34:40.449
We will be buried the same way.

01:34:47.169 --> 01:34:50.329
As my ancestor Oghuz was buried.

01:34:51.889 --> 01:34:53.449
As Çagri Bey was buried.

01:34:54.729 --> 01:34:56.489
As Tugrul Bey was buried.

01:34:58.289 --> 01:35:00.489
As my father, Suleyman Shah was buried.

01:35:02.369 --> 01:35:03.329
They

01:35:03.929 --> 01:35:07.049
went to war saluting the sunrise.

01:35:09.129 --> 01:35:11.289
Everywhere they went, they left a mark,

01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:13.449
a home behind them,

01:35:14.249 --> 01:35:17.489
and a holy cause for the future.

01:35:20.849 --> 01:35:22.609
What makes this soil honorable...

01:35:24.369 --> 01:35:25.729
is their blood.

01:35:32.089 --> 01:35:33.049
Now is the time

01:35:33.809 --> 01:35:35.329
to honor

01:35:36.089 --> 01:35:38.009
this dirty land

01:35:38.409 --> 01:35:40.129
with the blood of our fallen.

01:35:40.289 --> 01:35:43.049
Allah is great!

01:35:43.289 --> 01:35:46.169
Allah is great!

01:35:46.369 --> 01:35:49.409
Allah is great!

01:35:49.649 --> 01:35:52.609
Allah is great!

01:35:52.769 --> 01:35:55.769
Allah is great!

01:35:56.009 --> 01:35:58.889
Allah is great!

01:35:59.129 --> 01:36:01.929
Allah is great!

01:36:02.169 --> 01:36:05.169
Allah is great!

01:37:41.449 --> 01:37:43.449
This box holds Turgut's loyalty.

01:37:45.209 --> 01:37:48.009
And this loyalty will bring
the death of Ertuğrul.

01:37:50.409 --> 01:37:53.209
And we will lose a beloved brother
for this cause.

01:37:54.409 --> 01:37:57.489
But God will reward Alfonso in Heaven.

01:39:02.209 --> 01:39:03.289
Where to, Turgut Alp?

01:39:07.689 --> 01:39:08.969
I wish to visit

01:39:09.329 --> 01:39:12.169
the villages to see the Alps
I haven't seen for some time.

01:39:13.249 --> 01:39:14.209
Of course.

01:39:15.169 --> 01:39:17.089
You're used to going on horseback.

01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:19.129
Obviously, you're bored.

01:39:21.569 --> 01:39:22.769
I'll be back tomorrow.

01:39:23.449 --> 01:39:24.529
Tell Simon.

01:39:25.289 --> 01:39:26.289
Goodbye, Turgut.

01:39:58.049 --> 01:39:59.969
The Holy Spirit blesses you, Alfonso.

01:40:47.049 --> 01:40:48.529
Look at Aslıhan, my Bey.

01:40:49.569 --> 01:40:50.929
She's really worried.

01:40:51.769 --> 01:40:55.409
She wants it too,
but she's shy about Halime Hatun.

01:40:55.809 --> 01:40:57.809
This will be discussed this evening.

01:40:58.809 --> 01:41:00.769
Father will discuss it with Ertuğrul.

01:41:01.089 --> 01:41:02.049
But,

01:41:02.609 --> 01:41:05.569
I don't know if Ertuğrul
will live long enough

01:41:05.849 --> 01:41:07.089
to give an answer.

01:41:07.609 --> 01:41:08.809
What does that mean?

01:41:10.889 --> 01:41:11.889
My poor sister.

01:41:13.009 --> 01:41:15.489
She'll lose her beloved
before the marriage.

01:41:16.129 --> 01:41:17.569
Everything has changed.

01:41:18.849 --> 01:41:20.329
How will this happen?

01:41:22.409 --> 01:41:23.849
Just like Toktamiş.

01:41:24.809 --> 01:41:25.769
Actually,

01:41:25.969 --> 01:41:27.369
Ertuğrul's death

01:41:28.129 --> 01:41:30.209
will be worse than Toktamiş' death.

01:41:33.209 --> 01:41:36.449
Ertuğrul will get what's coming to him.

01:42:49.249 --> 01:42:50.889
What are you doing here, Turgut?

01:42:53.009 --> 01:42:54.289
Simon sent me.

01:42:55.129 --> 01:42:56.569
I'll carry the letter.

01:42:57.089 --> 01:42:58.289
Go back to the inn.

01:42:58.729 --> 01:43:02.849
Only a knight can carry the letter.
Simon wouldn't trust you with that.

01:43:07.089 --> 01:43:08.049
Enough.

01:44:55.809 --> 01:44:56.769
Here's the inn.

01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:58.609
One front door.

01:44:59.249 --> 01:45:01.329
Another door near the barn.

01:45:01.489 --> 01:45:02.449
Two doors.

01:45:03.649 --> 01:45:07.329
There'll be 30 to 40 men
with everyone included.

01:45:09.449 --> 01:45:11.209
There's 20 of us.

01:45:13.369 --> 01:45:14.329
My Bey.

01:45:15.049 --> 01:45:17.489
We'll count them before killing them.

01:45:26.049 --> 01:45:28.009
Any mistake at all,

01:45:28.569 --> 01:45:30.129
Bamsi will have to answer for it.

01:45:30.369 --> 01:45:33.409
I'll answer with my life, my Bey.

01:45:33.729 --> 01:45:37.329
We'll sacrifice everything for you,
my Bey.

01:45:42.249 --> 01:45:44.489
I know, Bamsi, I know.

01:45:46.369 --> 01:45:47.329
However,

01:45:47.889 --> 01:45:51.689
Kayi tribe, we don't need dead warriors.

01:45:52.529 --> 01:45:53.889
We need you alive.

01:45:54.129 --> 01:45:55.369
Thank you, my Bey.

01:45:59.049 --> 01:46:00.409
Scouts will go first.

01:46:01.129 --> 01:46:02.849
They'll leave no stone unturned.

01:46:04.049 --> 01:46:05.009
When we're here,

01:46:05.649 --> 01:46:07.249
at the crossroads...

01:46:09.929 --> 01:46:11.049
you will prepare.

01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:14.649
Archers will be on both sides.

01:46:18.289 --> 01:46:19.249
Unless I order it,

01:46:20.489 --> 01:46:21.449
nobody

01:46:21.729 --> 01:46:24.089
will leave their place.

01:46:25.609 --> 01:46:28.049
-Understood?
-As you command, my Bey.

01:46:32.369 --> 01:46:33.329
By the way...

01:46:35.249 --> 01:46:36.969
I want that devil Simon alive.

01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:42.689
We have a lot to learn from him.

01:46:58.329 --> 01:47:01.929
<i>Inshallah,</i> we'll fight under
the banners of Gündüz Bey one day.

01:47:04.849 --> 01:47:08.689
Brother, even now he'd fight better
than you.

01:47:10.889 --> 01:47:12.689
He's right, Doğan.

01:47:13.329 --> 01:47:14.289
Isn't he?

01:47:16.889 --> 01:47:18.369
Anything you say is true.

01:47:30.969 --> 01:47:33.929
If we wish to have a village
when Gündüz becomes Bey,

01:47:34.529 --> 01:47:35.969
we'll take precautions now.

01:47:38.369 --> 01:47:40.329
We'll cleanse our land of serpents,

01:47:40.809 --> 01:47:42.649
parasites, jackals,

01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:44.649
and pigs, so...

01:47:50.049 --> 01:47:53.569
Gündüz's sword can conquer us new lands.

01:47:54.369 --> 01:47:59.849
Long live our Bey,
long live our family!

01:47:59.929 --> 01:48:05.249
Long live our Bey,
long live our family!

01:48:05.329 --> 01:48:10.729
Long live our Bey,
long live our family!

01:48:13.449 --> 01:48:16.569
<i>Inshallah,</i> Allah will grant us those days
as well.

01:48:16.689 --> 01:48:17.809
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:48:19.809 --> 01:48:20.769
<i>Inshallah.</i>

01:48:22.209 --> 01:48:24.329
It will happen as long as we don't

01:48:25.329 --> 01:48:30.129
hand our land to that vicious infidel
and his scum.

01:48:30.929 --> 01:48:34.489
Doubting this means hopelessness.

01:48:35.529 --> 01:48:37.569
Hopelessness is a sin.

01:48:40.849 --> 01:48:42.649
We are Alps.

01:48:44.129 --> 01:48:45.249
We'll give our lives

01:48:46.369 --> 01:48:48.009
but not our hope.

01:48:51.889 --> 01:48:52.849
Our ancestors said,

01:48:53.889 --> 01:48:55.249
"A Turkish baby is a wolf.

01:48:55.889 --> 01:48:57.329
Where he steps, he conquers."

01:49:03.849 --> 01:49:05.329
Ask your questions now.

01:49:06.609 --> 01:49:07.569
Otherwise,

01:49:08.369 --> 01:49:09.489
after the council

01:49:10.129 --> 01:49:13.249
when everyone is asleep,
we'll move in for the ambush.

01:49:21.169 --> 01:49:22.129
My Bey.

01:49:24.809 --> 01:49:26.289
Our guests are here.

01:49:27.569 --> 01:49:28.809
Thanks, Abdurrahman.

01:49:39.569 --> 01:49:41.249
May we be victorious.

01:50:19.049 --> 01:50:20.609
Welcome, Candar Bey.

01:50:20.769 --> 01:50:22.329
You have honored our village.

01:50:22.489 --> 01:50:24.449
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:50:24.689 --> 01:50:26.009
The honor is all ours.

01:50:28.849 --> 01:50:30.369
How is your son?

01:50:32.129 --> 01:50:33.689
He's well, thank God.

01:50:35.889 --> 01:50:37.449
Welcome to you as well.

01:50:46.409 --> 01:50:47.369
Come now.

01:51:09.489 --> 01:51:10.929
Welcome again.

01:51:11.769 --> 01:51:14.129
You've honored our council.

01:51:14.489 --> 01:51:15.769
The ones saved

01:51:16.289 --> 01:51:18.289
are not foreigners,

01:51:19.009 --> 01:51:20.049
they're one with us.

01:51:20.769 --> 01:51:22.609
The honor is ours, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:51:25.889 --> 01:51:27.249
Our lives are saved.

01:51:29.009 --> 01:51:31.369
Now we'll cut off the head of the snake.

01:51:34.049 --> 01:51:36.689
Hasn't that girl spoken yet?

01:51:36.929 --> 01:51:38.409
I waited to hear news but...

01:51:39.849 --> 01:51:41.329
I let her go, Candar Bey.

01:51:52.489 --> 01:51:53.449
Forgive me,

01:51:54.049 --> 01:51:55.249
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:51:56.089 --> 01:51:57.049
But why?

01:51:57.769 --> 01:51:58.729
She is innocent.

01:51:59.409 --> 01:52:01.409
She only knows what she told Aliyar Bey.

01:52:04.569 --> 01:52:06.649
We were saved thanks to that.

01:52:10.609 --> 01:52:13.529
We don't know who's who anymore,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:52:14.769 --> 01:52:17.809
We don't know who to trust.

01:52:19.009 --> 01:52:21.529
From every angle comes a threat.

01:52:23.649 --> 01:52:25.209
Let them come, Candar Bey.

01:52:26.529 --> 01:52:28.729
We'll threaten them all.

01:52:40.529 --> 01:52:41.489
My Bey.

01:52:46.209 --> 01:52:47.169
My Bey,

01:52:47.569 --> 01:52:49.769
Master Haçaturyan wants to see you.

01:52:51.929 --> 01:52:53.249
Let him see Artuk Bey.

01:52:54.009 --> 01:52:55.009
As you command.

01:53:05.809 --> 01:53:06.769
We have neither

01:53:07.569 --> 01:53:08.649
a lead

01:53:09.609 --> 01:53:11.289
nor a witness, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:53:13.609 --> 01:53:14.809
One way or another

01:53:16.569 --> 01:53:18.009
whoever is behind this,

01:53:19.329 --> 01:53:20.729
I will find out

01:53:21.769 --> 01:53:22.969
where they live

01:53:23.609 --> 01:53:25.089
and make them regret it.

01:53:25.969 --> 01:53:26.929
Thank you.

01:53:31.089 --> 01:53:33.809
Despite our differences,

01:53:34.329 --> 01:53:35.569
when it comes to

01:53:35.809 --> 01:53:38.369
our villages and our existence,

01:53:39.209 --> 01:53:42.289
know that we support you, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:53:45.729 --> 01:53:48.649
Ural speaks the truth, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:53:49.849 --> 01:53:51.569
He just forgot one thing.

01:53:52.569 --> 01:53:55.649
We aren't two villages anymore.

01:53:56.409 --> 01:53:57.369
One village.

01:53:58.249 --> 01:54:02.609
Moreover, we are one family
with shared interests.

01:54:38.249 --> 01:54:39.209
My Bey.

01:54:40.289 --> 01:54:42.969
-With permission.
-Speak, Master Haçaturyan.

01:54:48.569 --> 01:54:51.729
What's wrong, Master Haçaturyan?

01:54:52.049 --> 01:54:53.009
My Bey, I know

01:54:53.529 --> 01:54:55.849
you told me not to come to the village.

01:54:56.529 --> 01:54:58.529
But I had to.

01:55:03.489 --> 01:55:04.449
The river

01:55:04.849 --> 01:55:06.609
was so generous that

01:55:07.369 --> 01:55:09.889
I filled a bag in no time.

01:55:10.729 --> 01:55:13.449
But protecting the gold is hard.

01:55:14.169 --> 01:55:15.769
I wanted to let you know

01:55:15.929 --> 01:55:18.409
and give you the gold.

01:55:34.289 --> 01:55:36.409
Thank you, Master Haçaturyan.

01:55:36.929 --> 01:55:38.609
You did well.

01:55:39.369 --> 01:55:41.689
Ertuğrul Bey will be very happy.

01:55:42.489 --> 01:55:46.889
Our coffers will be full of gold
thanks to you.

01:55:47.169 --> 01:55:48.129
My Bey,

01:55:48.569 --> 01:55:51.249
it was thanks to you and God.

01:55:51.689 --> 01:55:53.929
I am a mere mediator.

01:55:59.209 --> 01:56:02.769
Master Haçaturyan, keep working.

01:56:03.849 --> 01:56:06.009
Don't come to the village
unless necessary.

01:56:07.009 --> 01:56:12.009
Get your provisions quickly
and go back to the cave.

01:56:12.449 --> 01:56:14.609
Don't worry, Artuk Bey.

01:56:33.809 --> 01:56:35.769
We'll be back soon, son.

01:56:37.449 --> 01:56:38.889
Our suffering will end soon.

01:56:40.249 --> 01:56:41.809
Let's find out

01:56:42.649 --> 01:56:45.049
who that spy in the Sultan's palace is.

01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:08.329
Calm down, son.

01:57:16.529 --> 01:57:19.649
It seems you want to go back
even more than I do.

01:57:21.849 --> 01:57:23.089
But we still have time.

01:57:26.569 --> 01:57:30.489
This letter will allow us to return.

01:58:51.362 --> 01:58:52.562
About Turgut...

01:58:53.922 --> 01:58:55.722
You didn't deserve those words.

01:58:57.882 --> 01:58:59.042
Forgive me.

01:59:01.562 --> 01:59:02.842
You did a lot.

01:59:04.482 --> 01:59:06.202
Without you he would be dead.

01:59:08.202 --> 01:59:10.602
I wish I had let him die.

01:59:11.362 --> 01:59:12.322
He will die.

01:59:13.842 --> 01:59:15.442
I promise you, sister.

01:59:16.162 --> 01:59:17.442
You will kill him.

01:59:20.082 --> 01:59:22.442
But first, he will kill Ertuğrul.

01:59:51.002 --> 01:59:52.122
Welcome, Turgut Alp.

01:59:56.802 --> 01:59:58.002
Thank you, brother.

01:59:58.682 --> 02:00:02.402
Now, go tell Ertuğrul Bey
that there's an urgent issue.

02:00:03.522 --> 02:00:04.962
I have to see him now.

02:00:05.962 --> 02:00:07.522
-Go.
-Thank you.

02:00:25.402 --> 02:00:28.442
This is my father Suleyman Shah's sword.

02:00:33.642 --> 02:00:34.602
Damascus steel.

02:00:43.402 --> 02:00:49.762
What makes a sword valuable
is the hand that holds it.

02:00:54.602 --> 02:00:55.562
Look...

02:00:57.962 --> 02:01:02.202
My father Ginal Bey left this.

02:01:03.842 --> 02:01:06.322
This is Damascus steel too.

02:01:07.082 --> 02:01:10.202
<i>Inshallah,</i> we'll leave these to our sons.

02:01:13.682 --> 02:01:14.922
So this is the sword

02:01:15.762 --> 02:01:17.162
of Suleyman Shah,

02:01:17.882 --> 02:01:20.442
which bled many infidels from
Khorasan to Damascus.

02:01:22.802 --> 02:01:24.562
May I, Ertuğrul Bey?

02:01:24.962 --> 02:01:25.922
Yes.

02:01:33.562 --> 02:01:36.322
Really sharp.

02:01:38.482 --> 02:01:40.162
Obviously, a masterpiece.

02:01:42.562 --> 02:01:46.162
A sword twice quenched is a real sword.

02:01:47.122 --> 02:01:50.522
The iron twice quenched becomes strong.

02:01:51.162 --> 02:01:53.122
Becomes firm.

02:01:57.402 --> 02:01:58.562
Here, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:02:08.402 --> 02:02:09.402
Ertuğrul Bey.

02:02:11.122 --> 02:02:12.762
I've discussed with my sons.

02:02:15.162 --> 02:02:16.282
I have good news.

02:02:19.762 --> 02:02:24.562
I would like to see you personally
after the council.

02:02:37.362 --> 02:02:38.322
My Ertuğrul Bey.

02:02:39.922 --> 02:02:41.322
The table is ready, come.

02:02:46.642 --> 02:02:47.602
Come, sir.

02:03:12.162 --> 02:03:14.002
In the name of Allah.

02:03:15.762 --> 02:03:18.402
Thanks to Allah who gave us this food.

02:03:18.842 --> 02:03:20.002
-Amen.
-Amen.

02:03:20.482 --> 02:03:21.642
-Amen.
-Amen.

02:03:25.842 --> 02:03:27.682
Come along. Enjoy it.

02:04:10.082 --> 02:04:11.122
Permission, my Bey?

02:04:17.842 --> 02:04:18.802
My Bey.

02:04:21.042 --> 02:04:23.322
You know we have guests,
Abdurrahman.

02:04:25.442 --> 02:04:27.122
I didn't mean to disturb

02:04:28.242 --> 02:04:29.242
but it's important.

02:04:45.322 --> 02:04:46.522
Excuse me, Candar Bey.

02:04:46.882 --> 02:04:48.482
Of course, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:05:10.842 --> 02:05:11.802
My Bey.

02:05:16.322 --> 02:05:17.402
My brave brother.

02:05:17.842 --> 02:05:19.882
-Welcome.
-Thank you, my Bey.

02:05:21.042 --> 02:05:22.162
What's that letter?

02:05:22.602 --> 02:05:23.562
From Simon.

02:05:24.282 --> 02:05:26.282
To his spy at Sultan Alaaddin’s palace.

02:05:30.922 --> 02:05:32.122
Well done, Turgut.

02:05:33.122 --> 02:05:34.882
Knowledge is power.

02:05:35.442 --> 02:05:36.442
Thank you, my Bey.

02:05:37.562 --> 02:05:39.322
We'll attack after the council.

02:05:41.162 --> 02:05:43.522
It's been a while
since I heard something that good.

02:05:45.722 --> 02:05:46.842
Now, excuse me,

02:05:47.562 --> 02:05:49.242
I should get back before they notice.

02:05:55.282 --> 02:05:56.482
Godspeed, Turgut.

02:05:57.962 --> 02:05:58.922
Thank you, my Bey.

02:06:08.922 --> 02:06:11.722
<i>We met Abu Nakkash, his wish is clear.</i>

02:06:12.282 --> 02:06:15.282
{\an8}<i>Make Sultan Alaaddin incapable of ruling</i>
<i>and then overthrow him.</i>

02:06:16.682 --> 02:06:18.042
<i>For this, he needs chaos</i>

02:06:18.322 --> 02:06:20.042
<i>and disorder.</i>

02:06:21.642 --> 02:06:24.602
{\an8}<i>When Ertuğrul makes Amanda speak,</i>

02:06:25.602 --> 02:06:28.042
{\an8}<i>I can't even imagine Ural's demise.</i>

02:06:38.162 --> 02:06:39.122
Ural...

02:06:55.042 --> 02:06:56.282
Thank you, dear.

02:06:57.202 --> 02:06:58.762
It was delicious.

02:06:59.762 --> 02:07:00.882
Glad you liked it.

02:07:32.682 --> 02:07:34.162
I'm sorry, Candar Bey.

02:07:34.842 --> 02:07:36.442
No worries, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:07:38.482 --> 02:07:40.082
I hope it's nothing important.

02:07:42.082 --> 02:07:43.042
Nothing important.

02:08:05.522 --> 02:08:06.482
Nothing.

02:08:32.282 --> 02:08:33.242
Come now.

02:10:14.522 --> 02:10:15.802
From now on

02:10:16.042 --> 02:10:17.002
may our councils,

02:10:17.802 --> 02:10:18.962
our weddings

02:10:19.602 --> 02:10:22.082
and our funerals be one.

02:10:53.282 --> 02:10:54.242
Ertuğrul?

02:10:55.282 --> 02:10:56.242
Ertuğrul Bey.

02:11:08.082 --> 02:11:09.402
Ural, Aliyar!

02:11:11.522 --> 02:11:12.482
Ertuğrul.

02:11:15.802 --> 02:11:17.842
-Mother.
-Ertuğrul.

02:11:19.682 --> 02:11:21.082
Ertuğrul.

02:11:22.562 --> 02:11:24.082
-Ertuğrul Bey.
-My Bey.

02:12:00.122 --> 02:12:01.842
No! Brother!

02:12:02.402 --> 02:12:03.362
Brother!

02:12:03.522 --> 02:12:04.522
-Ertuğrul.
-Brother!

02:12:22.722 --> 02:12:24.722
Ertuğrul!
