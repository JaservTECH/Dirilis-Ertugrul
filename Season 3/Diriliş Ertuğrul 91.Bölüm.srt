00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 91 will start after 12:40 min.

13:21.418 --> 13:23.738
May God spare me a life

13:25.498 --> 13:27.418
without your love.

13:30.738 --> 13:32.698
May God never let us part, dear.

13:48.138 --> 13:49.338
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

13:53.378 --> 13:54.658
Welcome, sir.

13:55.978 --> 13:57.178
Thank you, Turgut.

13:57.618 --> 13:59.898
Come, let's eat together.

14:00.178 --> 14:01.418
Thank you.

14:23.178 --> 14:24.418
Go ahead, sir.

14:28.818 --> 14:30.138
Thank you, Turgut.

14:32.058 --> 14:34.818
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

14:43.298 --> 14:45.738
You're good at axe swinging,
but even better at cooking.

14:48.818 --> 14:50.058
Thank you, sir.

14:51.938 --> 14:54.298
I learned to paddle my own canoe.

14:57.098 --> 14:59.458
I know your yearning for Aykiz
is still there.

15:01.178 --> 15:02.138
However,

15:03.218 --> 15:07.298
if she could talk, don't you think that
she'd lament

15:07.498 --> 15:09.018
about the way you are?

15:14.258 --> 15:16.418
It's my destiny to be alone, sir.

15:19.778 --> 15:23.618
I have no other wish but to serve
for our cause

15:23.778 --> 15:25.458
as long as I'm alive.

15:27.298 --> 15:32.298
Turgut, a man needs to be a man first.

15:34.018 --> 15:36.138
He needs a woman that'll
keep him company.

15:36.858 --> 15:39.218
And a son that'll be the hope of his home.

15:41.298 --> 15:44.458
What would become of an alp
serving our cause in misery?

15:46.178 --> 15:48.218
However, if he serves with love

15:48.818 --> 15:52.658
and walks with love, I know he'll do well.

15:56.178 --> 15:57.378
And you know that, too.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.898
I know, sir.

16:04.818 --> 16:06.098
However...

16:08.378 --> 16:10.218
my heart's become like a desert.

16:13.418 --> 16:16.338
It's time for that desert
to grow forests, Turgut.

16:20.098 --> 16:21.498
How do you mean, sir?

16:21.938 --> 16:25.578
I want you to marry.

17:19.858 --> 17:21.138
Brother.

17:24.658 --> 17:27.978
Conqueror of battle fields.

17:30.978 --> 17:33.378
I'm left to face the harshest of battles.

17:36.778 --> 17:40.378
{\an8}And I don't know which one
is easier to handle.

17:48.732 --> 17:50.892
May I come in, Aslıhan Hatun?

17:53.012 --> 17:55.012
Come in, please, Ameer Almighty.

18:07.332 --> 18:09.052
I wanted to see you.

18:10.692 --> 18:12.852
I hope you have time for me.

18:13.492 --> 18:18.972
If our state's ameer wants to see
the Cavdar Bey, who am I to refuse?

18:25.932 --> 18:26.932
I came here

18:27.812 --> 18:30.652
to see my fiancée Aslıhan,

18:31.532 --> 18:33.492
not the Cavdar Bey Aslıhan.

18:35.492 --> 18:37.932
Then you shouldn't have come,
Ameer Almighty.

18:45.092 --> 18:46.092
Aslıhan...

18:48.572 --> 18:50.012
You don't care about me.

18:50.332 --> 18:52.012
But don't you care about your father?

18:53.852 --> 18:57.172
Don't you care about his promise to me?

18:57.372 --> 18:59.412
We made a promise to each other.

19:01.332 --> 19:04.092
I promised him that I would protect you,

19:04.212 --> 19:08.212
and care for you till I die.

19:08.892 --> 19:10.052
And he promised me

19:10.412 --> 19:15.812
that Aslıhan was going to be my wife,
God willing.

19:16.132 --> 19:18.732
He said, "God willing."

19:20.052 --> 19:21.892
I gave a promise to my brother, too.

19:22.972 --> 19:27.092
I said, "I will never leave my tribe
without a leader."

19:27.612 --> 19:29.332
Then why do you refuse me?

19:30.092 --> 19:32.172
I am the Ameer of Seljuk Empire.

19:32.532 --> 19:35.932
Let us revive your tribe together.

19:36.252 --> 19:39.092
Let me do my best.

19:40.052 --> 19:41.852
We don't need anybody's help,
Ameer Almighty.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.292
Thank you very much.

19:47.932 --> 19:48.932
All right.

19:50.452 --> 19:52.532
Enough with the kindness.

19:55.252 --> 19:58.532
You probably don't know
how serious this is, Aslıhan.

20:00.172 --> 20:04.532
What would happen to your tribe
when you refuse me?

20:06.212 --> 20:07.972
Did you think about that?

20:17.692 --> 20:18.692
Bey...

20:20.052 --> 20:23.292
you know that I would die for you
a thousand times.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.372
But I cannot do that.

20:30.572 --> 20:32.092
It would ruin not only me,

20:32.852 --> 20:34.972
but also the woman who will be my wife.

20:37.892 --> 20:39.732
How can I make her happy...

20:42.852 --> 20:44.572
with my broken heart?

20:45.612 --> 20:48.732
You have come out alive
from a lot of fights, Turgut.

20:51.252 --> 20:54.132
You will face this great challenge, too,
God willing.

20:55.612 --> 20:56.652
But, bey...

20:57.732 --> 21:00.652
who would accept to be my companion...

21:01.892 --> 21:03.892
at this great challenge?

21:05.052 --> 21:06.372
Aslıhan Hatun.

21:13.612 --> 21:14.972
How is that possible, bey?

21:15.252 --> 21:17.252
What about Ameer Sadettin?

21:19.892 --> 21:22.732
Aslıhan Hatun does not want to
marry Ameer Sadettin.

21:23.052 --> 21:26.932
And we can't force her into marriage,
since she is like a sister to me.

21:30.092 --> 21:33.732
It is our duty to marry her
to a decent man.

21:35.372 --> 21:38.012
And I think you are that decent man.

21:39.292 --> 21:40.452
Bey...

21:41.572 --> 21:43.772
while my love for Aykiz

21:43.932 --> 21:46.012
is still tearing my heart out,

21:47.132 --> 21:49.692
how can I love Aslıhan Hatun?

21:51.892 --> 21:54.732
I don't want to do her an injustice.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.172
You will love her over time, Turgut.

22:01.652 --> 22:04.572
You would suit each other perfectly.

22:05.852 --> 22:09.852
Your broken hearts
will be whole over time.

22:14.012 --> 22:17.052
But, Aslıhan Hatun
would never leave her tribe, bey.

22:17.652 --> 22:19.492
She does not want to leave her tribe.

22:23.052 --> 22:25.812
Do you want me to leave mine?

22:29.612 --> 22:31.812
I want to unite our tribes, Turgut.

22:36.052 --> 22:38.532
Together we win.

22:39.612 --> 22:42.492
Divided we fall.

22:43.132 --> 22:46.652
This marriage would be good

22:46.812 --> 22:48.972
for the unity of our tribes.

22:57.852 --> 23:00.772
I know, it is hard for you.

23:03.652 --> 23:06.132
However,
you will overcome these difficulties.

23:09.252 --> 23:12.092
Thank you, bey, thank you.

23:18.292 --> 23:19.972
For our descendants...

23:20.972 --> 23:22.492
for our traditions...

23:23.292 --> 23:26.532
and for the sake of our tribes' hopes...

23:28.332 --> 23:29.932
I will put out my heart's fire

23:30.692 --> 23:32.252
with my tears.

23:35.972 --> 23:38.572
Whatever you wish, bey.

23:40.772 --> 23:42.012
Thank you, Turgut.

23:47.052 --> 23:50.052
You must keep your promise,
Aslıhan Hatun.

23:50.692 --> 23:52.132
You made a promise to me.

23:52.452 --> 23:55.372
By breaking your promise,
you are ruining not only mine,

23:55.572 --> 23:57.892
but also your reputation.

23:57.972 --> 23:59.532
You still don't understand this?

23:59.852 --> 24:03.052
You are enslaved by your desire,
Ameer Almighty.

24:03.692 --> 24:08.372
You do not think about anything
but pride and reputation.

24:10.892 --> 24:14.492
There is nothing more important
than pride and reputation!

24:17.172 --> 24:18.692
And as a woman

24:18.892 --> 24:22.252
who let down Ameer Sadettin
you will not find any man

24:22.572 --> 24:26.412
who would be brave enough to marry you.

24:29.052 --> 24:34.212
Aslıhan, if you leave me you will wither
like a lonely flower.

24:36.412 --> 24:41.052
You would decay here.
You refused everything

24:41.212 --> 24:42.772
for your tribe.

24:45.492 --> 24:48.412
Childless, alone,

24:49.212 --> 24:50.612
and hopeless.

24:53.772 --> 24:56.012
You should never forget this:

24:59.572 --> 25:01.092
I am your destiny...

25:02.612 --> 25:03.612
now.

25:09.292 --> 25:13.092
I only care about my tribe.

25:16.372 --> 25:19.772
And I'm not afraid of dying alone at all.

25:24.412 --> 25:26.732
Hereafter, I am the Cavdar Bey Aslıhan,

25:27.372 --> 25:30.332
not your fiancée Aslıhan!

25:35.452 --> 25:37.412
I am breaking off...

25:38.132 --> 25:39.252
the engagement.

25:44.572 --> 25:47.732
My destiny is to grow old in my tribe,

25:48.092 --> 25:49.652
and die in my tribe.

26:02.172 --> 26:03.652
You should know that.

26:12.572 --> 26:13.812
When...

26:17.812 --> 26:20.012
you end up as a beautiful
but lonely woman...

26:23.172 --> 26:24.772
because of your pride...

26:28.252 --> 26:31.172
you will regret this.

26:34.252 --> 26:35.932
But it will be too late.

26:37.172 --> 26:38.452
Think about this.

26:42.412 --> 26:45.732
Think about what you just lost,
and what you will...

26:48.372 --> 26:49.372
lose.

27:19.132 --> 27:21.812
What is it, Son?
You wanted to see us.

27:23.932 --> 27:26.052
I hope everything is all right.

27:26.412 --> 27:29.212
Everything is all right, Mother. Sit down.

27:37.572 --> 27:41.292
I want to marry Aslıhan Hatun
to a decent man from our tribe.

27:46.572 --> 27:48.172
That sounds good, Son.

27:48.652 --> 27:51.092
But what will Aslıhan say about this?

27:53.692 --> 27:56.452
Since she talked to you
about Ameer Sadettin,

27:57.332 --> 27:59.452
it means she wants our help with that.

28:01.492 --> 28:03.492
Who do you have in mind, bey?

28:04.452 --> 28:05.452
Turgut Alp.

28:10.652 --> 28:11.652
Bey...

28:13.412 --> 28:16.892
how are you going to put out
the fire of love in Turgut Alp?

28:19.572 --> 28:21.212
Will this fire ever stop burning?

28:22.692 --> 28:27.372
Would Aslıhan Hatun agree to this,
if she knew Turgut Alp's old wounds?

28:32.532 --> 28:33.892
You can't find happiness,

28:34.652 --> 28:36.612
without suffering first, Halime Sultan.

28:39.732 --> 28:42.972
And both Turgut and Aslıhan
can stand this suffering.

28:45.972 --> 28:47.372
I talked with Turgut.

28:48.812 --> 28:50.972
He accepts my offer, if Aslıhan Hatun...

28:52.932 --> 28:54.292
says yes.

28:58.332 --> 29:01.132
Bey, what about Ameer Sadettin?

29:02.012 --> 29:03.572
Would he accept this?

29:05.652 --> 29:07.812
He will be on their backs.

29:09.452 --> 29:11.452
He won't let them live their lives.

29:12.052 --> 29:14.892
Ameer Sadettin
cannot do much harm to them.

29:16.652 --> 29:18.852
And we will always stand by them.

29:19.852 --> 29:21.972
If he tries to hurt them,

29:22.412 --> 29:24.092
I will stand against him.

29:27.012 --> 29:31.372
And Turgut is a strong man,
he can deal with Ameer Sadettin's tricks.

29:34.612 --> 29:36.772
I want you to go
and talk to Aslıhan Hatun.

29:37.292 --> 29:38.692
If she accepts this,

29:39.332 --> 29:42.212
we should take care of this
as soon as possible.

29:42.412 --> 29:44.412
Marriage is a great thing, Son.

29:45.012 --> 29:47.972
If Aslıhan Hatun accepts, too...

29:49.452 --> 29:52.612
we would fulfill Aliyar Bey's dying wish.

29:53.932 --> 29:57.092
We would protect both his tribe,

29:57.812 --> 29:59.972
and his sister from any instigation.

30:01.252 --> 30:02.612
God willing, Mother.

30:05.372 --> 30:06.372
God willing.

30:08.372 --> 30:09.932
With this marriage,

30:10.812 --> 30:12.892
we will connect our tribes
politically, too.

30:13.612 --> 30:17.452
This is very important
for our tribes' future.

30:36.092 --> 30:39.052
The Emperor wants us
to make an agreement with the Turks.

30:40.052 --> 30:42.372
He says, raise the taxes
and give them what they want.

30:43.092 --> 30:46.292
And he sent Commander Ares
to conduct the negotiations.

30:47.292 --> 30:48.972
Commander Ares...

30:50.052 --> 30:52.932
The Emperor made the right decision

30:53.052 --> 30:54.852
by sending a great commander like him.

30:55.492 --> 30:57.812
We could have fought, we could have won.

30:58.052 --> 30:59.772
Most of our soldiers are dead.

31:00.012 --> 31:03.452
If we summoned new troops,
Ertuğrul would have killed them, too.

31:03.772 --> 31:05.132
We could have lost.

31:05.892 --> 31:08.452
We would have died with honor.
As Vasilius did.

31:08.932 --> 31:12.492
Vasilius died for nothing,
because of his temper and greed.

31:13.052 --> 31:17.772
Remember, we will have our honor,
as long as we have this castle standing.

31:18.092 --> 31:20.932
So, you have a voice in the castle,
now, Ekaterina.

31:21.892 --> 31:24.092
You have managed to convince
the Emperor, too.

31:24.892 --> 31:27.892
Justice is served now, thank God.

31:28.492 --> 31:31.012
The Emperor does nothing for our state,

31:31.772 --> 31:35.732
and now he gives a woman
so much authority.

31:35.892 --> 31:38.412
You are underestimating
a woman like me, Nikolas.

31:38.812 --> 31:42.332
You should know that,
if you stand against me one day,

31:43.012 --> 31:44.932
no one can protect you from me.

31:46.892 --> 31:49.652
Who do you think you are to threaten me?

31:49.932 --> 31:51.652
May I come in, sir?

31:51.812 --> 31:53.052
Come in!

32:01.252 --> 32:03.452
Sir, there's a Turk here.

32:03.772 --> 32:06.012
He says he is a messenger for Sultan.

32:10.812 --> 32:11.932
Let him come in.

32:16.172 --> 32:17.172
Soldiers!

32:17.532 --> 32:20.812
They're starting to come at us
like vultures.

32:21.132 --> 32:24.412
Come to your senses.
Choose your side right.

32:25.052 --> 32:26.932
Or you will pay for it.

32:42.252 --> 32:47.212
Seeing you in our nomad tent
and hosting you here is a great honor.

32:48.172 --> 32:49.332
Thank you, my dear.

32:50.772 --> 32:52.772
We are here

32:53.532 --> 32:56.012
as the messengers for Ertuğrul Bey.

32:57.972 --> 32:59.612
We have something to say.

33:01.452 --> 33:02.652
I hope nothing is wrong.

33:08.732 --> 33:11.932
You are like a daughter to me, my dear.

33:12.732 --> 33:15.052
And like a sister to Ertuğrul Bey.

33:15.492 --> 33:18.612
Your trouble is our trouble.

33:21.772 --> 33:25.652
We cannot close our eyes to
you being forced into a marriage.

33:27.452 --> 33:29.372
May God bless you for that.

33:30.892 --> 33:33.852
However, Ameer Sadettin
will not leave me alone.

33:37.172 --> 33:39.012
I could not talk him out of it.

33:39.292 --> 33:44.252
I broke off the engagement, I told him
to his face this isn't going to happen...

33:45.772 --> 33:47.452
but he doesn't look like he will give up.

33:49.692 --> 33:51.692
Men have pride.

33:52.172 --> 33:54.692
They cannot accept defeat.

33:55.172 --> 33:58.932
They would fight for their love.

33:59.372 --> 34:03.012
However, if one of the sides
is not happy about it,

34:03.172 --> 34:05.212
life would be miserable.

34:05.652 --> 34:06.772
It is, Mother.

34:07.572 --> 34:09.212
Life is miserable for me already.

34:12.732 --> 34:14.812
Everyday feels like a nightmare.

34:14.972 --> 34:17.812
Then, my dear,
there is only one way out of this.

34:18.212 --> 34:21.292
Ameer Sadettin finds you alone.

34:22.172 --> 34:23.892
He finds you hopeless.

34:24.572 --> 34:27.132
He does not care about anybody, Mother.

34:31.292 --> 34:36.092
A jackal only fears a lion, my dear.

34:37.972 --> 34:41.012
I know how you can save yourself from him.

34:41.892 --> 34:44.332
You need a lion

34:44.812 --> 34:47.052
that will love you, protect you,

34:47.612 --> 34:50.132
look out for you,
and stand against Ameer Sadettin,

34:50.612 --> 34:56.372
and say, "Aslıhan is my wife now.
You will stay away from her."

34:58.572 --> 35:00.172
So, my dear,

35:00.492 --> 35:04.652
Ertuğrul Bey thinks that the only way
to save you from Ameer Sadettin

35:05.972 --> 35:09.332
would be marrying you to someone else.

35:09.972 --> 35:11.172
Mother Hayme,

35:11.892 --> 35:16.372
who would dare to marry me
after Ameer Sadettin?

35:19.252 --> 35:21.252
Someone who will protect you,

35:22.372 --> 35:25.572
someone who will devote his life to you,
and that brave man is...

35:27.732 --> 35:29.532
Turgut Alp, my dear.

35:36.852 --> 35:39.772
Ertuğrul Bey thinks
that you would suit each other perfectly.

35:40.332 --> 35:43.292
Of course,
you need to give your consent, too.

36:13.412 --> 36:14.452
Artuk Bey...

36:15.332 --> 36:16.292
what do you want?

36:17.532 --> 36:19.932
I want to talk with
the commander of the castle.

36:22.252 --> 36:23.612
We're listening to you.

36:24.692 --> 36:26.892
I am not going to talk to you,
Çolpan Hatun.

36:26.972 --> 36:28.692
My name is Ekaterina.

36:30.292 --> 36:32.612
And you will talk with
Commander Nikolas and I.

36:33.972 --> 36:36.812
You have heard her.
Now talk, Turk.

36:44.052 --> 36:49.452
Sultan of the Seljuk Sultanate,
Alaeddin Kayqubad, commands that...

36:52.132 --> 36:54.972
hereafter, Karacahisar Castle

36:55.412 --> 36:58.652
will be home of justice, not cruelty.

36:59.612 --> 37:03.572
If you turn the castle over to us,
your lives will be spared,

37:04.132 --> 37:07.932
and we will let your soldiers
go back to Nicaea safe and sound.

37:11.692 --> 37:13.092
Otherwise,

37:13.572 --> 37:15.372
we will level the castle to the ground,

37:15.652 --> 37:18.252
and kill each and every one of you!

37:19.852 --> 37:25.092
The ones who resist will suffer the rage
of our Sultan and his army.

37:26.332 --> 37:29.292
This is our first and last call.

37:31.812 --> 37:33.732
It is up to you to obey the call.

37:36.372 --> 37:38.332
Or you will face the consequences.

38:01.732 --> 38:04.812
Sultan, I have
some important news from Konya.

38:04.892 --> 38:06.052
What is it, Aziz?

38:08.172 --> 38:09.252
The Ayyubid army.

38:10.452 --> 38:12.692
They are heading towards
our borders, Sultan.

38:24.492 --> 38:26.532
They're taking
advantage of Mongol attacks,

38:27.252 --> 38:29.052
and want to subvert my state.

38:32.692 --> 38:35.692
Bring Ameer Sadettin
and Ertuğrul Bey to me.

38:36.132 --> 38:37.572
Yes, Sultan.

38:44.812 --> 38:46.452
Tell your sultan,

38:47.652 --> 38:49.052
we are ready for an agreement.

38:50.092 --> 38:54.332
Our Emperor will send Commander Ares
to conduct the negotiations.

38:56.332 --> 38:59.772
We believe
we can solve our problems in peace.

39:00.372 --> 39:02.372
Sultan's commands are clear.

39:02.852 --> 39:06.572
He will decide whether
he will make an agreement with you.

39:07.492 --> 39:10.892
I am sure your Sultan will not refuse
a profitable agreement like this.

39:11.772 --> 39:17.532
We will live in peace,
without losing anybody anymore.

39:17.652 --> 39:20.452
Otherwise, he will
level the castle to the ground.

39:22.532 --> 39:24.372
And everybody would find peace then.

39:37.292 --> 39:40.612
We do not fear you.
This is not over yet.

39:41.172 --> 39:43.572
We will speak the language
that you understand.

39:49.652 --> 39:50.652
Mother Hayme,

39:51.812 --> 39:53.212
before anything else,

39:53.332 --> 39:56.812
I broke up with Ameer Sadettin,
because I don't want to leave my tribe.

39:58.852 --> 40:03.132
He is a bad-tempered man,
but if it wasn't for my tribe,

40:03.772 --> 40:07.132
I would have hidden the distress
and accept my destiny.

40:15.412 --> 40:18.612
What about Turgut Alp,
would he agree to come to my tribe?

40:19.412 --> 40:21.572
Ertuğrul Bey has talked with Turgut.

40:22.812 --> 40:27.492
He is a self-sacrificing person like you,
who considers what's best for his tribe.

40:29.212 --> 40:32.852
And he agreed to live here
in Cavdar Tribe.

40:37.492 --> 40:39.372
God bless him for that.

40:40.252 --> 40:43.532
Not every man would make such a sacrifice.

40:44.052 --> 40:48.212
That's why Ertuğrul Bey thinks
that you would suit each other perfectly.

40:48.852 --> 40:52.452
You both live for the same cause,

40:52.972 --> 40:55.412
and you only care about your tribes.

40:57.892 --> 40:58.812
Look, my dear...

40:59.932 --> 41:03.932
you will need someone like him
on this sacred road.

41:05.012 --> 41:08.372
Marriage is based upon self-sacrifice.

41:09.172 --> 41:12.252
If you combine your love
with self-sacrifice,

41:13.812 --> 41:15.612
you will have peace in your lives.

41:17.332 --> 41:19.092
I only seek peace, Mother.

41:20.932 --> 41:26.612
Turgut Alp is a brave, chivalrous man.
He fought together with my brother.

41:27.892 --> 41:30.652
Ertuğrul Bey's companion
cannot be a bad man.

41:31.572 --> 41:36.052
That's why we are asking you
to think about this, Aslıhan Hatun.

41:37.092 --> 41:40.252
If you give your consent,
we will make this happen.

41:41.372 --> 41:46.532
There is no time for thinking, Halime.
I am having nightmares every night.

41:47.652 --> 41:50.092
Ertuğrul Bey must have thought carefully.

41:50.772 --> 41:55.452
If Turgut Alp will be staying at my tribe,
I give my consent for this marriage.

42:00.732 --> 42:06.172
Then we will come to visit you tonight,
if it is okay with you, my dear.

42:07.532 --> 42:09.892
We do it properly.

42:10.812 --> 42:15.052
We do it in accordance with
our traditions and our religion.

42:16.292 --> 42:19.972
You are welcome, Mother.
You would honor my nomad tent.

42:23.252 --> 42:25.372
We will send Abdur Rahman to the khan

42:26.092 --> 42:28.492
to give Ertuğrul Bey the good news.

42:31.692 --> 42:34.652
We need to go now.

42:38.212 --> 42:39.212
Mother...

42:47.172 --> 42:49.692
-Good luck with it.
-God willing.

42:58.412 --> 43:01.332
Sultan will send Ameer Sadettin
for the negotiations.

43:01.892 --> 43:03.132
And Ertuğrul.

43:03.572 --> 43:05.372
What is on your mind, Nikolas?

43:05.732 --> 43:07.532
They will not come out alive from here.

43:08.052 --> 43:09.532
Do you hear what you are saying?

43:10.172 --> 43:12.772
We cannot have Ertuğrul vulnerable again.

43:12.972 --> 43:14.212
You cannot do that.

43:14.412 --> 43:17.932
I want Ertuğrul and Ameer Sadettin dead,
more than you do.

43:18.372 --> 43:19.972
But, no. Not like this.

43:20.292 --> 43:23.052
If you do this, Sultan will
level the castle to the ground.

43:23.212 --> 43:24.852
Do you think I care?

43:26.532 --> 43:28.732
What are you going to do when Ares comes?

43:30.132 --> 43:31.972
He would never let you do that.

43:32.052 --> 43:35.452
I will kill him too, if necessary.
I am the commander of this castle.

43:36.332 --> 43:37.492
May I come in, sir?

43:44.652 --> 43:47.692
Commander Ares is entering the castle
with his soldiers, sir.

43:48.772 --> 43:51.492
Let's not keep the great commander
of the Emperor waiting.

44:14.772 --> 44:17.372
Bey, I brought you a message
from Mother Hayme.

44:17.772 --> 44:18.892
Tell me, Abdur Rahman.

44:19.572 --> 44:23.492
Mother Hayme said everything is fine,
and you will go to visit tonight.

44:24.212 --> 44:25.612
Thank you, Abdur Rahman.

44:30.052 --> 44:32.212
Bey, what visit is this?

44:33.292 --> 44:35.092
It is an auspicious visit, Bamsi.

44:35.452 --> 44:36.612
Oh. An auspicious visit.

44:36.852 --> 44:38.892
Good. Who is getting married, bey?

44:43.172 --> 44:44.252
Turgut.

44:45.612 --> 44:47.932
My God! My brother Turgut?

44:48.292 --> 44:51.332
Bey, tell me more.
How did this happen? Who is the girl?

45:00.172 --> 45:03.452
Bamsi, come with me.
I will tell you everything.

45:03.732 --> 45:05.572
Okay, brother.

45:14.052 --> 45:16.812
You are responsible for my suffering.

45:18.772 --> 45:20.612
You have poisoned Aslıhan.

45:22.572 --> 45:25.812
She broke her father's promise to me.

45:26.532 --> 45:28.692
Aslıhan Hatun made a decision,

45:29.252 --> 45:31.332
and everybody
needs to respect her decision.

45:33.812 --> 45:36.492
What about Candar Bey's decision?

45:37.652 --> 45:40.972
Why are you not following
an elder's order?

45:41.412 --> 45:44.932
Why are you not following my decision?

45:49.332 --> 45:53.492
Why are you creating difficulties
for this marriage, Ertuğrul?

45:54.692 --> 45:59.172
Ameer Almighty, if we are going to
call each other to account

45:59.932 --> 46:02.252
for the things that have happened to us...

46:03.612 --> 46:05.012
you'll take the blame for that.

46:06.172 --> 46:08.412
You are wrong on this, Ertuğrul.

46:09.252 --> 46:15.492
You have involved with this personally.
You got inside Aslıhan's head purposely.

46:16.932 --> 46:20.932
What is essential
is getting inside your lover's heart.

46:29.252 --> 46:32.612
Come on, brother, tell me.
What is this all about?

46:32.772 --> 46:36.772
Who is this girl? Is she from our tribe?

46:36.852 --> 46:39.012
Or from another tribe?
From a near tribe, or a far one?

46:39.132 --> 46:41.612
Tell me. Tell me, brother, Go on.

46:42.772 --> 46:44.852
You won't let me get a word in, Bamsi.

46:45.492 --> 46:50.532
Oh. Brother, I'm just excited
because of all this joy.

46:51.012 --> 46:52.012
Oh, dear.

46:52.332 --> 46:57.852
Brother, tell me. Who is this girl? Go on.

47:02.492 --> 47:05.732
The women Ertuğrul Bey wants me
to marry with...

47:05.852 --> 47:07.052
Yes, brother?

47:09.172 --> 47:10.612
...is Aslıhan Hatun.

47:22.412 --> 47:23.532
Bamsi?

47:26.692 --> 47:28.052
Bamsi, recover yourself!

47:31.972 --> 47:36.092
Brother, did I hear right?

47:36.812 --> 47:38.772
Did you say Aslıhan Hatun?

47:40.172 --> 47:43.012
Yes. I said Aslıhan Hatun.

47:44.532 --> 47:49.292
Brother, isn't Aslıhan Hatun
engaged to Ameer Sadettin?

47:51.212 --> 47:52.812
Aslıhan doesn't want him.

47:53.292 --> 47:55.572
She said she would never leave her tribe.

47:57.292 --> 47:59.412
She made a promise to
the deceased Aliyar Bey.

48:01.212 --> 48:06.172
Right. Ameer Sadettin will take her away
from her tribe, for sure.

48:07.012 --> 48:08.932
And Aslıhan Hatun doesn't want that.

48:09.612 --> 48:12.332
Her tribe would be without a leader then.

48:14.692 --> 48:17.452
And Ertuğrul Bey wants her to stay

48:18.772 --> 48:20.612
for the future of Cavdar Tribe.

48:23.092 --> 48:25.172
And he wants me to marry her,

48:26.332 --> 48:32.052
so Ameer Sadettin will get off her back,
and our tribes will be united.

48:38.532 --> 48:39.612
Good.

48:40.892 --> 48:41.972
Good.

48:43.772 --> 48:44.932
My brother!

48:45.012 --> 48:46.492
My dear brother!

48:47.372 --> 48:48.892
My brother is getting married!

48:49.012 --> 48:50.692
My dear brother.

48:50.812 --> 48:55.452
I am feeling on top of the world now,
because of you, brother!

48:56.372 --> 49:00.932
Take it easy, Bamsi. We didn't ask for
the girl's hand. She hasn't said yes yet.

49:01.212 --> 49:05.172
What are you saying, brother?
Is there a manlier man than you?

49:05.372 --> 49:08.772
Brother, you would suit Aslıhan Hatun,
and she would suit you, too.

49:08.892 --> 49:12.172
Let's hope for the best.
God willing!

49:14.772 --> 49:15.772
Amen.

49:16.132 --> 49:19.092
But, brother... We...

49:19.172 --> 49:24.092
Since we will go to visit her tonight,
we need to get ready. Get up!

49:24.212 --> 49:26.772
-Get up, brother.
-Stop it, Bamsi. What are you doing?

49:27.252 --> 49:31.772
Brother, first,
we need to put you in order.

49:31.972 --> 49:36.852
And we will start by tidying your hair.

49:37.132 --> 49:41.372
Can't you see?
Your hair looks like a real mess.

49:45.212 --> 49:47.332
I will take care of this.

50:12.452 --> 50:16.732
Ameer Sadettin, Ertuğrul Bey.
Sultan wants to see you.

50:37.612 --> 50:40.212
Come. I have been waiting for you.

50:43.852 --> 50:46.892
I got the news from Konya
that I have been waiting for.

50:51.092 --> 50:54.732
The Ayyubid army
is heading towards our borders.

50:58.172 --> 50:59.572
The Ayyubid's greed

50:59.932 --> 51:03.172
will give the Mongols
the opportunity they've been looking for.

51:06.492 --> 51:11.092
Ogeday's scattered troops
will take this opportunity

51:12.172 --> 51:14.972
and attack our state's inner walls.

51:15.732 --> 51:18.492
You were the one
who faced the Mongols' advance guards

51:18.572 --> 51:20.652
at our border, Ertuğrul Bey.

51:21.532 --> 51:24.612
You know them well, too.
And you are right.

51:25.252 --> 51:29.412
When they get the chance
their troops will come,

51:29.612 --> 51:32.132
not to plunder, but to demolish my state.

51:33.252 --> 51:35.052
War is inevitable, Sultan.

51:35.892 --> 51:39.892
We have to launch a campaign
against them, with our army.

51:42.532 --> 51:45.172
It is not about war, Ameer Sadettin.

51:47.252 --> 51:50.212
When the time comes, The Ayyubid

51:51.452 --> 51:54.652
will taste my sword,
as my many enemies have before.

51:57.812 --> 52:01.732
It is about the situation
which the Islamic world is in.

52:06.572 --> 52:11.092
Not only Islamic states,
but even the smallest emirates

52:11.452 --> 52:15.692
are killing each other
with their unabated greed.

52:16.532 --> 52:18.252
Until we unite them,

52:19.212 --> 52:22.732
both Mongol and the Crusader raids

52:23.092 --> 52:25.652
will continue to strike us, Sultan.

52:26.052 --> 52:29.132
We will never drop Islam's justice flag
to the ground, Ertuğrul Bey.

52:30.732 --> 52:32.332
With God's permission...

52:33.852 --> 52:35.932
this flag will always be in the air.

52:37.052 --> 52:41.412
The ones who will stop
the Mongol and the Crusaders’ atrocity

52:41.772 --> 52:44.812
are the brave men
who will fight under the Islam flag.

52:47.292 --> 52:49.972
As long as our state is enduring...

52:51.772 --> 52:55.412
and our beys are as brave and fair as you.

53:05.732 --> 53:07.492
It is almost done...

53:09.092 --> 53:11.292
We are about to finish.
Just wait, brother.

53:20.572 --> 53:21.652
It is done, brother.

53:22.092 --> 53:24.412
Now, you are ready to go.

53:24.972 --> 53:28.252
Now you look like you are going to
visit a woman, not going to war.

53:28.652 --> 53:30.292
You look wonderful. Wonderful!

53:31.612 --> 53:34.052
See it for yourself.

53:35.532 --> 53:36.692
Look, brother.

53:53.892 --> 53:56.012
-Bamsi, what did you do?
-What?

53:57.572 --> 53:58.652
What is this?

53:58.732 --> 54:01.252
-You look excellent, brother.
-You call this excellent?

54:02.052 --> 54:03.332
It looks like a goat licked it.

54:04.812 --> 54:06.372
Why are you getting mad, brother?

54:07.212 --> 54:10.812
It worked for me.
Hafsa Hatun liked me because of this.

54:16.132 --> 54:18.372
It is not about your hair, brother,

54:19.452 --> 54:20.972
it is your heart.

54:22.772 --> 54:25.652
Hafsa Hatun likes your heart.

54:29.252 --> 54:31.732
Good. You are right about this, brother.

54:32.252 --> 54:35.572
You are right. Good. However...

54:35.812 --> 54:38.172
However, brother, a real man

54:38.292 --> 54:41.212
is the one who is heartsick,
and his hair is slicked.

54:41.492 --> 54:43.932
And brother, when Aslıhan Hatun
sees you like this,

54:44.052 --> 54:46.292
she will be thunderstruck.

54:46.932 --> 54:49.132
Sure, she will be thunderstruck.

54:50.852 --> 54:52.252
Good, then.

54:52.692 --> 54:55.412
Brother, we didn't dress you yet.

54:55.532 --> 54:57.252
Let's dress you, then.

54:57.532 --> 54:59.172
Stop, brother. Stop.

54:59.292 --> 55:00.812
Please stop.

55:00.892 --> 55:03.052
I can take care of it. Okay?

55:03.332 --> 55:04.292
Okay.

55:04.652 --> 55:06.652
Good. You take care of it.

55:07.212 --> 55:08.332
You do that.

55:15.732 --> 55:16.692
No!

55:16.932 --> 55:18.292
Not this one, brother.

55:18.452 --> 55:20.532
Not this shirt. Drop this.

55:25.292 --> 55:30.092
Brother, are you going to migrate
to a colder place with that one?

55:31.292 --> 55:33.012
No, brother. No.

55:33.092 --> 55:35.532
You should wear something thinner.

55:35.732 --> 55:37.772
Drop that, brother. Drop it.

55:38.452 --> 55:40.132
Tell me! What should I wear?

55:40.252 --> 55:41.452
I will show you.

55:43.012 --> 55:45.292
Not this one. Not this one, either.

55:49.532 --> 55:51.652
Sultan, Artuk Bey is here.

55:52.052 --> 55:53.412
Let him come in.

56:08.052 --> 56:12.412
Sultan, I delivered your message
to Karacahisar Castle.

56:12.892 --> 56:16.692
Emperor sent a commander
with full authorization.

56:17.132 --> 56:21.532
They invite your envoys to the castle
for peace negotiations tomorrow.

57:21.892 --> 57:24.132
You have honored our castle,
Commander Ares.

57:25.572 --> 57:28.172
Do you know what honor means
for a soldier, Nikolas?

57:29.132 --> 57:30.052
Commander Ares...

57:31.812 --> 57:33.612
It means to live with loyalty,

57:34.332 --> 57:36.052
and die for his commander.

57:37.612 --> 57:39.572
I heard you left Vasilius for dead.

57:39.932 --> 57:42.052
I could not leave the castle defenseless,

57:42.172 --> 57:43.852
when Vasilius left
it was ambushed by Ertuğrul, sir.

57:44.892 --> 57:46.612
I live to die with honor.

57:47.212 --> 57:49.892
If I made a mistake,
I am ready to pay the price.

58:07.892 --> 58:11.252
Vasilius paid that price
with his blood, Nikolas.

58:12.972 --> 58:15.852
I am ready to die for you,
and for our Emperor.

58:40.052 --> 58:41.332
May God forgive his sins.

58:49.012 --> 58:54.052
A castle without a commander
is like a ruin!

58:57.812 --> 58:59.852
But a ruin with a commander...

59:02.012 --> 59:04.332
is stronger than Byzantine's walls!

59:06.412 --> 59:08.172
When a soldier
leave his commander for dead,

59:08.892 --> 59:11.692
it means he also
hands over the castle to the enemy!

59:18.332 --> 59:20.812
Now take this disloyal man's body here.

59:21.412 --> 59:24.812
I don't want him to soil the memory
of the soldiers who died for the Emperor.

01:00:02.452 --> 01:00:03.412
Are you Ekaterina?

01:00:04.932 --> 01:00:06.052
Yes, it is me.

01:00:11.572 --> 01:00:13.252
{\an8}Come with me. We need to talk.

01:00:21.604 --> 01:00:24.724
My Sultan, the emperor
will agree to anything

01:00:25.284 --> 01:00:26.924
except surrendering the castle.

01:00:28.204 --> 01:00:32.084
It's clear that he'll accept our terms,
no matter how harsh.

01:00:34.204 --> 01:00:36.444
My Sultan, this might be for the best.

01:00:37.684 --> 01:00:41.724
Vasilius' death, your presence here,
and your army heading this way

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:44.244
have obviously intimidated
the emperor, my Sultan.

01:00:46.204 --> 01:00:49.044
It's time to stem the poison
which flows from this fortress.

01:00:50.764 --> 01:00:54.844
They are evidently afraid,
but in the current situation,

01:00:55.044 --> 01:01:00.404
I believe it would be best to force
them to seek peace.

01:01:02.044 --> 01:01:04.484
-Continue, Sadettin.
-My Sultan...

01:01:05.404 --> 01:01:08.084
the demands on our army
will be considerable

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.084
during the campaign against the Ayyubids,

01:01:10.524 --> 01:01:15.244
and this way, we can achieve victory
without risking a single soldier.

01:01:15.844 --> 01:01:19.404
In addition, the taxes
we will force them to pay

01:01:19.524 --> 01:01:22.564
can be used to strengthen our state.

01:01:23.324 --> 01:01:27.364
My Sultan... gold can't
compensate for treachery.

01:01:28.244 --> 01:01:33.444
As long as Karacahisar Castle is under
their rule, victory will not be ours.

01:01:36.564 --> 01:01:37.964
You're right, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:01:38.804 --> 01:01:43.044
We will not rest easy
until we have uprooted this evil.

01:01:43.924 --> 01:01:49.084
The most pressing issue
is how we address the Ayyubid violations.

01:01:50.084 --> 01:01:55.964
My Sultan, if we divide our army,
we cannot win both wars.

01:01:56.844 --> 01:02:00.404
If we merely subject them
to the heavy taxes Emir Sadettin suggests,

01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:03.364
we're giving them time
to regroup, my Sultan.

01:02:07.204 --> 01:02:11.444
They're weak, my Sultan.
This is our chance. Our only chance.

01:02:11.884 --> 01:02:14.724
We'll not give them time to
heal their wounds, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:02:16.484 --> 01:02:18.764
We'll stop them regaining their strength.

01:02:21.524 --> 01:02:24.484
I have the utmost faith in the Turk Beys,

01:02:25.364 --> 01:02:27.884
your valiant alps
and, most of all, in you.

01:02:34.444 --> 01:02:36.404
We will agree to a deal for now.

01:02:38.564 --> 01:02:41.804
And when the time comes,
we will drain the swamp.

01:02:48.724 --> 01:02:49.924
With your permission,

01:02:50.084 --> 01:02:53.324
I'd like to go to the castle
to negotiate the agreement, my Sultan.

01:02:57.244 --> 01:03:01.964
In that case, I don't think any agreement
should be limited to taxes, my Sultan.

01:03:03.724 --> 01:03:08.204
We need to make it clear to the emperor

01:03:08.524 --> 01:03:10.684
that they cannot take so much
as a breath in these lands

01:03:11.564 --> 01:03:12.964
without our permission.

01:03:14.764 --> 01:03:16.004
If you'll allow it,

01:03:16.404 --> 01:03:19.564
as your chief bey of the frontier,
I too would like to go to the castle.

01:03:22.004 --> 01:03:24.364
Very good. Very good.

01:03:26.484 --> 01:03:28.884
I have no doubt that you will both
carry out this duty

01:03:28.964 --> 01:03:31.244
to the best of your abilities.

01:03:48.684 --> 01:03:49.604
Lion.

01:03:55.484 --> 01:04:00.244
My brother, no woman who sees you
will know what hit her.

01:04:00.764 --> 01:04:03.764
Her heart will flutter like a bird.

01:04:04.204 --> 01:04:10.524
She will frolic in the fields
like a young horse.

01:04:12.564 --> 01:04:14.604
Bless my brother! Bless him!

01:04:18.004 --> 01:04:19.884
-Thank you, brother.
-Bless you.

01:04:21.684 --> 01:04:23.004
My dear brother.

01:04:23.764 --> 01:04:25.004
-Thanks.
-You're welcome

01:04:31.164 --> 01:04:32.364
Turgut Alp?

01:04:35.324 --> 01:04:39.604
Brother, you know how I told you
that they wouldn't know what hit them?

01:04:39.724 --> 01:04:40.884
Look at him.

01:04:43.804 --> 01:04:44.964
Speak, Günküt.

01:04:46.404 --> 01:04:50.684
Brother Günküt, why are you
staring like a fox that's seen a rabbit?

01:04:51.444 --> 01:04:53.564
I was looking at Turgut Alp, bless him.

01:04:54.404 --> 01:04:57.364
Well, don't.
You'll cast the evil eye on him.

01:04:58.244 --> 01:04:59.324
I said bless him, brother.

01:05:00.524 --> 01:05:03.604
You said that to Brother Dumrul, too,
when he dressed up like our sultan,

01:05:03.924 --> 01:05:05.484
and he barely made it out alive!

01:05:10.884 --> 01:05:14.324
-What is it, Günküt?
-Ertuğrul Bey says we must leave.

01:05:16.924 --> 01:05:17.764
All right.

01:05:19.604 --> 01:05:22.444
Well then, it's time.

01:05:23.364 --> 01:05:26.564
Come on, now. Come on, brother.
May God lead your way.

01:05:32.364 --> 01:05:34.044
Bless him, bless him.

01:05:36.324 --> 01:05:38.964
You saved our state from disaster.

01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:42.564
If Nikolas had defeated you...

01:05:43.604 --> 01:05:46.564
he'd have been able to kill the Turks
that had come to make a deal.

01:05:47.004 --> 01:05:49.124
You should've known
that I'd never have allowed that.

01:05:50.084 --> 01:05:52.284
The letter said you would arrive tomorrow.

01:05:53.084 --> 01:05:56.604
The fact that you arrived early shows that
you understand exactly what's going on.

01:05:57.044 --> 01:05:59.764
Because of him, the Sultan's army
and the Turk tribes

01:05:59.844 --> 01:06:01.364
would have raided the castle.

01:06:01.884 --> 01:06:04.924
And you would have lost the privileges
the Emperor granted you.

01:06:05.844 --> 01:06:08.724
Ertuğrul took everything I had from me.

01:06:09.284 --> 01:06:11.644
Nobody wants him to die as much as I,

01:06:11.724 --> 01:06:15.164
or for the Turk tribes to go back
to the hell they came from as much as I.

01:06:15.524 --> 01:06:18.124
I swore an oath that
I'd die for our emperor.

01:06:18.844 --> 01:06:23.924
Paying them huge amounts in taxes
is hardly a retaliation, is it, Ekaterina?

01:06:24.684 --> 01:06:28.084
All I know is that the Turks will
never stop clamoring for blood.

01:06:28.724 --> 01:06:31.564
I never believed they would,
nor did our emperor.

01:06:31.684 --> 01:06:34.604
As powerful a commander as yourself
surely wouldn't fall for that.

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:38.964
I understand now why Vasilius
had so much confidence in you.

01:06:40.444 --> 01:06:42.684
I carry the fruit of his love in my loins.

01:06:43.484 --> 01:06:47.044
I would give my life
and that of my child for the Emperor.

01:06:47.924 --> 01:06:50.644
You impressed our emperor greatly
with your letter, Ekaterina.

01:06:51.124 --> 01:06:54.964
You persuaded him that we could only
get rid of the Turks with your help.

01:06:55.804 --> 01:07:01.004
I am prepared to do anything for our state
and my father's holy legacy.

01:07:01.844 --> 01:07:04.844
I would very much like to believe
that you are strong enough to drive

01:07:04.964 --> 01:07:08.244
your poisonous dagger into the heart of
the Turks when the time comes, Ekaterina.

01:07:09.804 --> 01:07:11.884
Believe me, Commander Ares,

01:07:12.764 --> 01:07:17.204
for those forced to share this land
with the Turks, you are our last hope.

01:07:17.844 --> 01:07:19.084
May God protect you.

01:07:20.364 --> 01:07:23.764
Ertuğrul... He is not an easy man to kill.

01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:26.044
You know that better than anyone.

01:07:26.924 --> 01:07:31.084
The Crusaders, Vasilius,
your late husband Ural...

01:07:32.484 --> 01:07:37.284
-You know everything.
-I know my enemies, Ertuğrul best of all.

01:07:38.244 --> 01:07:40.204
And more than you might think.

01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:44.764
I have my eye on you, Ekaterina.

01:07:46.404 --> 01:07:50.364
I look forward to seeing
what you can do. Now go.

01:07:51.924 --> 01:07:53.844
I have matters to discuss
with my commanders.

01:08:11.404 --> 01:08:15.924
Our Father, who art in heaven,
spare me from the cowardly enemy

01:08:17.324 --> 01:08:19.484
and the betrayal of those
who seem like friends.

01:08:20.884 --> 01:08:26.044
If I am to die, let it be in victory
over the Turks, and not in defeat.

01:08:27.004 --> 01:08:27.964
Amen.

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:50.524
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

01:08:51.244 --> 01:08:53.484
You give honor to my tent, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:08:55.404 --> 01:08:59.404
-Welcome, Mother Hayme.
-Thank you, my girl.

01:09:03.724 --> 01:09:04.684
Halime.

01:09:12.164 --> 01:09:14.204
Welcome to you too, Turgut Alp.

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:17.724
Thank you, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:09:19.764 --> 01:09:23.644
Come, you must be tired.
Let us eat and relax.

01:09:47.364 --> 01:09:49.164
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:09:55.444 --> 01:09:59.004
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:10:13.244 --> 01:10:18.524
Just as we break this bread together,
so we have shared in joy and sorrow too.

01:10:20.764 --> 01:10:24.324
We have forged a strong bond
between the two tribes.

01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:30.244
Now, it is my wish

01:10:30.684 --> 01:10:33.604
for this bond to be strengthened
through blood ties

01:10:34.084 --> 01:10:35.884
so we can travel a new and better path.

01:10:36.604 --> 01:10:39.964
Anything which benefits our tribes
is most welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:10:41.204 --> 01:10:44.844
Quite so, my girl.
That's why our minds are easy.

01:10:45.724 --> 01:10:48.284
We will leave your tent
in good faith, God willing.

01:10:49.484 --> 01:10:50.524
Thank you.

01:10:52.364 --> 01:10:58.124
Aslıhan Hatun... you and Turgut Alp
are like sister and brother to me.

01:10:59.164 --> 01:11:00.644
You know why we are here.

01:11:02.724 --> 01:11:06.564
On the one hand, there is you,
whom Aliyar Bey entrusted to my care.

01:11:07.284 --> 01:11:09.844
And on the other,
there is the prosperity of our tribes.

01:11:11.124 --> 01:11:14.164
Aslıhan Hatun, it is my wish

01:11:14.844 --> 01:11:17.804
that you and Turgut Alp marry.

01:11:21.484 --> 01:11:25.324
Whatever is in your heart,
say it freely, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:11:26.764 --> 01:11:32.604
I have but one intention, and that is to
protect my tribe and my brother's legacy.

01:11:34.324 --> 01:11:38.364
God willing, I would like to
fill my tent with my children,

01:11:38.844 --> 01:11:42.004
raise a son, and continue my lineage.

01:11:48.044 --> 01:11:49.764
Do you have anything to say, Turgut Alp?

01:11:55.324 --> 01:11:58.084
We fought many a battle
side by side with Aliyar Bey.

01:12:00.124 --> 01:12:05.124
We never once yielded to the enemy when
with the valiant alps of the Cavdar Tribe.

01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:11.924
Our sole intent... was to never sway
from the road of holy jihad.

01:12:13.364 --> 01:12:15.244
As the Kayi Tribe is my home...

01:12:16.524 --> 01:12:18.364
so too is the Cavdar Tribe.

01:12:19.644 --> 01:12:22.364
Dedicating your life to your children...

01:12:23.364 --> 01:12:26.284
to your home and to your woman...

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:30.004
is the duty of a man.

01:12:38.524 --> 01:12:40.164
I would happily dedicate myself

01:12:40.524 --> 01:12:42.764
to he who dedicates himself
to my tribe, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:13:26.244 --> 01:13:27.604
Enjoy, my Sultan.

01:13:40.004 --> 01:13:41.284
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:13:58.844 --> 01:14:02.404
The archers that attacked
Ertuğrul Bey and his alps...

01:14:03.244 --> 01:14:06.524
Still nothing? Still no word?

01:14:08.684 --> 01:14:11.204
Everywhere we look
is only dead ends, my Sultan.

01:14:11.644 --> 01:14:14.404
We've tried to get information,
but it's hard.

01:14:15.444 --> 01:14:18.324
The treachery runs deep, Sadettin.

01:14:20.444 --> 01:14:21.804
The treachery runs deep.

01:14:22.284 --> 01:14:28.644
If I don't triumph, the traitors who have
infiltrated the veins of our state will.

01:14:36.804 --> 01:14:42.324
Our overriding duty is to maintain order
preserve the state, my Sultan.

01:14:44.444 --> 01:14:48.644
As soon as we return from the campaign,
I will take more precautions, God willing.

01:14:49.524 --> 01:14:50.564
However...

01:14:52.364 --> 01:14:54.204
there is something that worries me.

01:14:55.884 --> 01:14:56.804
What?

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:01.324
The Mongolian threat.

01:15:03.684 --> 01:15:07.404
The Mongols won't stay quiet
while you're away. That's obvious.

01:15:08.684 --> 01:15:11.844
I believe it's imperative that we
take precautions against them.

01:15:13.444 --> 01:15:15.164
What are you thinking, Sadettin?

01:15:17.564 --> 01:15:19.244
I must give him his due.

01:15:21.044 --> 01:15:23.404
Ertuğrul Bey is exactly
the right man for this.

01:15:24.684 --> 01:15:27.484
He's spent more time fighting
the Mongols than any of us.

01:15:29.044 --> 01:15:32.364
He got rid of that troublemaker Noyan.

01:15:33.124 --> 01:15:35.124
Who knows the Mongols best?

01:15:36.444 --> 01:15:40.924
Who of your beys
understands their tongue most clearly?

01:15:41.764 --> 01:15:43.084
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:15:44.564 --> 01:15:45.924
You're right, Sadettin.

01:15:47.604 --> 01:15:48.644
You're right.

01:15:50.244 --> 01:15:53.284
However, in Ertuğrul Bey's absence...

01:15:54.004 --> 01:15:57.764
I fear our western frontier
will be vulnerable.

01:15:59.804 --> 01:16:04.044
Then, if you see fit, I will stay

01:16:04.284 --> 01:16:06.884
and do my best to serve you from here.

01:16:09.924 --> 01:16:14.484
I hope I will be able to fill his shoes.

01:16:24.444 --> 01:16:27.164
I'll discuss it with
Ertuğrul Bey, tomorrow.

01:16:30.684 --> 01:16:35.804
The unity of the Turk tribes
is of the utmost importance.

01:16:37.644 --> 01:16:42.884
You must have understood why Aslıhan Hatun
wanted to remain the head of her tribe.

01:16:43.844 --> 01:16:45.684
-My Sultan?
-Aslıhan Hatun

01:16:46.164 --> 01:16:48.804
quite naturally wants to stay
as the head of her tribe

01:16:48.884 --> 01:16:52.124
and preserve Candar Bey's lineage.

01:16:52.804 --> 01:16:54.804
She is the hope of her tribe.

01:16:55.604 --> 01:16:59.404
Don't take that away from them, Sadettin.

01:16:59.924 --> 01:17:01.444
-My Sultan--
-I have no doubt

01:17:02.164 --> 01:17:05.404
that you will make
this sacrifice for our state.

01:17:24.444 --> 01:17:25.484
Thank you.

01:17:36.524 --> 01:17:37.644
Sister Aslıhan.

01:17:39.124 --> 01:17:40.804
We spoke plainly.

01:17:41.684 --> 01:17:43.684
We didn't hurt or get hurt.

01:17:46.524 --> 01:17:48.004
By the command of God...

01:17:49.524 --> 01:17:51.164
and the word of the Prophet...

01:17:52.324 --> 01:17:55.884
we would like you to marry Turgut Alp.

01:17:58.204 --> 01:17:59.444
Do you consent?

01:18:13.164 --> 01:18:17.604
I have the utmost trust in you
and Turgut Alp, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:18:20.564 --> 01:18:21.684
I consent.

01:18:30.804 --> 01:18:32.404
May God bless you.

01:18:47.884 --> 01:18:48.964
Be with God.

01:19:06.204 --> 01:19:07.364
Be with God, my son.

01:19:15.764 --> 01:19:19.484
May God grant you lasting peace.

01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:25.324
May your children be loyal
to your beliefs, your law and your tribe,

01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:27.404
and may they make you happy.

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:31.044
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:19:31.524 --> 01:19:34.364
May your sons prosper
and your lineage grow.

01:19:35.844 --> 01:19:37.204
May God unite you as one.

01:19:39.444 --> 01:19:44.484
If anyone should cast
the evil eye upon your tent...

01:19:46.204 --> 01:19:47.844
my tent would go up in flames, too.

01:19:49.444 --> 01:19:52.844
If the whole world rose up against you,

01:19:54.404 --> 01:19:57.364
they would taste my wrath.

01:19:58.924 --> 01:20:00.724
I want you to be married quickly.

01:20:01.604 --> 01:20:07.884
I wish this marriage to cast a veil
over evil eyes and shield your tent.

01:20:08.444 --> 01:20:12.084
May your happiness
and your lineage be eternal.

01:20:13.004 --> 01:20:14.524
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:20:15.604 --> 01:20:16.564
Amen.

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:31.084
<i>From this moment forth,</i>
<i>I am not your fiancé Aslıhan,</i>

01:20:31.644 --> 01:20:34.364
but Aslıhan, bey of the Cavdars.

01:20:35.604 --> 01:20:38.684
Our engagement is over

01:20:39.804 --> 01:20:44.884
My fate will be to grow old in my tribe
and die with my tribe.

01:20:54.524 --> 01:20:55.604
Aslıhan...

01:20:58.204 --> 01:21:00.644
You have sent me to hell.

01:21:08.084 --> 01:21:10.484
Eminence, there is word of Aslıhan Hatun.

01:21:11.244 --> 01:21:12.084
Tell me.

01:21:12.404 --> 01:21:15.004
Ertuğrul Bey, Hayme Hatun,
Halime Hatun and Turgut Alp

01:21:15.364 --> 01:21:17.444
have visited the Cavdar Tribe.

01:21:20.524 --> 01:21:21.564
Interesting.

01:21:25.684 --> 01:21:26.644
Interesting.

01:21:30.444 --> 01:21:32.644
-What for?
-We don't know, Your Eminence.

01:21:36.724 --> 01:21:37.684
Leave.

01:21:45.964 --> 01:21:48.644
What are you up to now, Ertuğrul?

01:21:57.924 --> 01:21:59.804
Surely you will be gone soon, Ertuğrul.

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:06.484
You'll leave, taking your tricks
and the trouble you caused me with you.

01:22:11.044 --> 01:22:12.764
When you are fighting your campaign...

01:22:14.924 --> 01:22:16.644
my reign will begin.

01:22:19.404 --> 01:22:22.324
My war will begin.

01:22:45.364 --> 01:22:47.164
All right then.

01:23:06.524 --> 01:23:09.124
-Here you go, brother.
-Thank you, brother.

01:23:09.524 --> 01:23:10.524
Here you go, brother.

01:23:12.244 --> 01:23:13.284
Thank you, brother.

01:23:13.604 --> 01:23:18.644
Brothers, my brother Turgut's
good fortune has made all of us happy.

01:23:19.324 --> 01:23:23.804
I thought I'd give a feast
in my brother's honor.

01:23:25.524 --> 01:23:29.684
Hafsa made this wonderful food
with her own hands.

01:23:40.124 --> 01:23:41.364
-Brother?
-Yeah?

01:23:42.324 --> 01:23:44.764
We are going to eat weeds
like goats. Weeds.

01:23:46.644 --> 01:23:48.004
Hush, Kader. Hush.

01:23:55.204 --> 01:23:56.604
There was no need, brother.

01:23:58.964 --> 01:24:00.004
God bless you.

01:24:02.764 --> 01:24:06.164
-Thank you for your trouble, Hafsa Hatun.
-Brothers!

01:24:06.404 --> 01:24:10.484
Eat first, and then say what you will.

01:24:12.764 --> 01:24:13.724
Bamsi...

01:24:34.084 --> 01:24:36.204
I wish I could have made fish.

01:24:36.844 --> 01:24:40.164
We used to eat lots of fish,
but it's hard to find around here.

01:24:40.404 --> 01:24:43.844
Don't worry, Hafsa Baci.
We'll eat whatever God offers.

01:24:44.844 --> 01:24:45.804
We will.

01:25:15.724 --> 01:25:16.564
Thank you.

01:25:20.044 --> 01:25:22.444
There we are. All right.

01:25:26.644 --> 01:25:29.884
In Nicaea we would enhance
our food with various herbs.

01:25:30.284 --> 01:25:32.964
They are both delicious
and good for the digestion.

01:25:34.804 --> 01:25:36.604
I put a lot of spices into the stew.

01:25:37.204 --> 01:25:40.524
It's not like the one you make.
I hope you like it.

01:25:43.564 --> 01:25:44.764
Come on.

01:25:45.924 --> 01:25:49.044
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:25:49.404 --> 01:25:50.524
Here you go, brother.

01:25:52.964 --> 01:25:53.844
<i>Bismillah.</i>

01:26:37.684 --> 01:26:39.684
I've never eaten
such delicious stew before.

01:26:40.484 --> 01:26:43.244
Really brother, what have
we been eating up till now?

01:26:43.884 --> 01:26:47.284
-I'm glad you like it. Bamsi?
-Yeah?

01:26:47.924 --> 01:26:51.364
I'd like to go see Banu Çiçek for a while.
You should tend to everyone.

01:26:52.044 --> 01:26:55.964
Don't worry. I can
take care of my brothers.

01:26:56.284 --> 01:26:57.444
Off you go.

01:26:59.084 --> 01:27:00.044
Enjoy your meal.

01:27:02.724 --> 01:27:03.964
Thank you.

01:27:22.844 --> 01:27:26.404
Hey! You're going to choke, slow down.

01:27:28.364 --> 01:27:32.044
Brother, what kind of food is this?

01:27:32.604 --> 01:27:34.164
You are so lucky.

01:27:35.524 --> 01:27:41.124
Well, brother, you all know my appetite.
This is what I needed all along.

01:27:41.444 --> 01:27:43.564
These spices make the food
taste very different.

01:27:43.964 --> 01:27:46.284
Yeah. No need to worry
about it being left for the goats!

01:27:48.484 --> 01:27:51.524
You're not so different
to a goat yourself, Brother Günküt.

01:27:56.444 --> 01:28:00.924
Brothers, God created
man in various forms.

01:28:01.324 --> 01:28:07.044
Each people has its own food,
its own way of baking bread.

01:28:07.244 --> 01:28:11.004
Brothers, we should experience these foods
and remember them.

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:18.644
I wonder what happened to Turgut Alp.

01:28:20.324 --> 01:28:23.004
I hope everything turned out well for him.

01:28:23.404 --> 01:28:26.844
Brother, if Ertuğrul Bey was involved,
no other outcome is possible.

01:28:29.244 --> 01:28:32.964
It is done.
Now, we have one last thing to do.

01:28:33.724 --> 01:28:34.964
What is that, brother?

01:28:36.484 --> 01:28:38.484
We make for Karacahisar Castle, brother.

01:28:40.564 --> 01:28:42.164
We ride in the morning.

01:28:44.724 --> 01:28:45.884
Eat, eat.

01:28:54.204 --> 01:28:55.364
So good.

01:29:01.844 --> 01:29:05.124
You eat like a goat. Like a goat, Günküt!

01:29:05.364 --> 01:29:06.724
You eat like a goat!

01:29:52.724 --> 01:29:55.564
<i>An empire can only stand</i>
<i>so much belittlement.</i>

01:29:56.044 --> 01:29:59.324
<i>You believed them to be a mere tribe</i>
<i>and took for granted an enemy</i>

01:29:59.444 --> 01:30:01.484
<i>that grew in power before your very eyes.</i>

01:30:21.884 --> 01:30:24.404
<i>I don't know who makes me angrier,</i>

01:30:24.564 --> 01:30:27.644
<i>my foolish friend or my cunning enemy.</i>

01:30:29.164 --> 01:30:33.444
<i>Ertuğrul Bey,</i>
<i>come to my castle in search of victory.</i>

01:30:34.084 --> 01:30:37.564
<i>Be arrogant. Show weakness.</i>

01:30:38.804 --> 01:30:39.924
<i>Prepare your own end.</i>

01:30:49.684 --> 01:30:53.244
Commander Ares, Emir Sadettin
and Ertuğrul Bey have arrived.

01:31:04.564 --> 01:31:05.644
Guards!

01:31:39.244 --> 01:31:40.364
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:31:48.404 --> 01:31:51.484
-Emir Sadettin, welcome.
-Thank you.

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:56.564
Your reputation precedes you,
Ertuğrul Bey. You are a valiant warrior.

01:31:57.084 --> 01:31:59.924
-We meet at last.
-I do not fight...

01:32:00.564 --> 01:32:03.604
to further my reputation, but for justice.
You must have heard that too.

01:32:05.004 --> 01:32:08.684
Although we are enemies, we fight for
the same thing ultimately, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:32:09.164 --> 01:32:10.204
Justice.

01:32:11.884 --> 01:32:16.124
I always respect a chivalrous enemy,
and you are one of them.

01:32:17.484 --> 01:32:20.644
Our objectives are night and day, Ares.

01:32:22.964 --> 01:32:25.204
What you consider just, I consider cruel.

01:32:25.684 --> 01:32:28.604
And I trample cruelty under my feet.

01:32:32.884 --> 01:32:35.124
See, that's another thing
we have in common.

01:32:35.764 --> 01:32:37.444
Ruthlessness against the cruel.

01:32:38.124 --> 01:32:39.204
We will get along well.

01:32:41.924 --> 01:32:45.724
Emir Sadettin, there is much talk of you
at Nicaea. Your cunning is legendary.

01:32:46.484 --> 01:32:50.444
How nice. You must know then that I'm not
likely to walk out of here empty-handed.

01:32:52.644 --> 01:32:55.564
-Show our guests the way.
-No need, Ares.

01:32:56.124 --> 01:32:57.764
I have been here many times before.

01:33:23.284 --> 01:33:28.564
In order to stay with my tribe
and serve it until the end of my days,

01:33:28.644 --> 01:33:31.444
I have broken off my engagement
to Emir Sadettin.

01:33:36.684 --> 01:33:39.724
And to further our bond
with the Kayi tribe

01:33:40.044 --> 01:33:42.604
and become blood relatives,

01:33:42.884 --> 01:33:45.244
I have decided to marry Turgut Alp.

01:33:48.484 --> 01:33:52.364
I hope this marriage will
be for the best for both tribes.

01:33:52.924 --> 01:33:54.044
May God make it so.

01:33:55.204 --> 01:33:58.524
-I hope it will be good.
-Thank you.

01:34:00.044 --> 01:34:03.044
Please tell the tribe of my decision.

01:34:03.404 --> 01:34:07.684
Let everyone know that from this moment,
Turgut Alp is my betrothed.

01:34:26.084 --> 01:34:28.124
There is a long road ahead of us
and many things to do.

01:34:28.604 --> 01:34:31.324
We have come to hear Nicaea's offer.

01:34:32.644 --> 01:34:34.844
In the name of the Seljuks,
Emir Sadettin...

01:34:36.324 --> 01:34:39.524
bey of the Kayi tribe,
and chief frontier bey of the Seljuks,

01:34:39.924 --> 01:34:41.044
Ertuğrul Bey...

01:34:43.204 --> 01:34:46.564
I am authorized to speak
in the name of our emperor.

01:35:00.004 --> 01:35:03.964
Ekaterina is entitled to attend, by the
privilege awarded to her by our emperor.

01:35:14.004 --> 01:35:18.124
We are here to negotiate
for the mutual benefit of both sides.

01:35:38.524 --> 01:35:41.804
The outcome is obvious.
Make your offer quickly.

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:47.204
Our offer will protect
both your soldiers and ours.

01:35:47.964 --> 01:35:51.244
The emperor in Nicaea
is ready to pay for peace.

01:35:52.844 --> 01:35:55.924
Our empire will pay
the following tribute to the Seljuk State.

01:35:56.884 --> 01:36:00.604
Each year, 150,000 gold coins,
200,000 silver...

01:36:02.324 --> 01:36:04.644
and a cut of the trade routes.

01:36:11.924 --> 01:36:15.764
The war will end,
and our peoples will live in peace.

01:36:16.764 --> 01:36:21.764
As long as peace is maintained,
the tribute will continue to be paid.

01:36:22.564 --> 01:36:23.484
Very good.

01:36:25.004 --> 01:36:28.324
I know how generous
the emperor in Nicaea is.

01:36:31.724 --> 01:36:37.404
And you should know how forgiving
our Sultan Alâeddin Keykubat is.

01:36:42.084 --> 01:36:45.324
In return for your tribute,
your lives will be spared.

01:36:46.084 --> 01:36:49.444
You will be allowed
to remain in the castle.

01:36:51.364 --> 01:36:52.764
We have a deal, then.

01:36:54.644 --> 01:36:56.244
That was your offer, Ares.

01:36:58.324 --> 01:36:59.524
We haven't discussed it yet.

01:37:01.924 --> 01:37:03.764
What do you mean, Ertuğrul Bey?

01:37:07.764 --> 01:37:10.764
You may be able to convince
the Latins with a handful of gold...

01:37:14.804 --> 01:37:16.644
but we did not come here for a tribute.

01:37:18.564 --> 01:37:19.644
What is your demand?

01:37:25.204 --> 01:37:31.324
Every year, you will pay 300,000 in gold
and 400,000 in silver to the Seljuk State.

01:37:35.124 --> 01:37:39.524
The gates of the castle will be open
to all Turks and Muslims.

01:37:41.204 --> 01:37:46.724
No taxes or interest will be applied
to Muslims trading at the castle.

01:37:47.644 --> 01:37:51.804
All trade routes will be under
the management of the Turkmen tribes.

01:37:52.644 --> 01:37:57.804
There will be a limit on the number
of soldiers stationed at the castle.

01:37:58.684 --> 01:38:00.364
We will specify how many.

01:38:01.524 --> 01:38:06.364
The Turks and Muslims
who live and trade in the castle

01:38:06.884 --> 01:38:10.204
will be under the protection
of the Seljuk State.

01:38:12.724 --> 01:38:17.684
We cannot accept these terms. You have
not come to negotiate, but to invade.

01:38:19.004 --> 01:38:19.924
Ertuğrul Bey...

01:38:21.444 --> 01:38:24.724
What you are asking for
is the surrender of the castle.

01:38:27.684 --> 01:38:29.244
You have exhausted our patience.

01:38:31.924 --> 01:38:35.404
Either you accept our demands, or...

01:38:37.164 --> 01:38:41.204
we will melt the iron mountain,
make the sky tremble...

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:45.524
and lay waste to your castle.

01:38:55.924 --> 01:38:56.964
Wait.

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:04.484
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:39:08.164 --> 01:39:09.884
Your demands are too harsh.

01:39:12.004 --> 01:39:14.364
Give us a few days to decide.

01:39:16.124 --> 01:39:17.164
I will be back soon.

01:39:19.164 --> 01:39:20.564
Make your decision quickly.

01:39:25.204 --> 01:39:26.084
Door!

01:39:48.284 --> 01:39:49.324
He's insane!

01:39:49.924 --> 01:39:52.684
He's lost his mind!
He thinks we're helpless.

01:39:52.804 --> 01:39:54.004
He's forcing us.

01:39:55.124 --> 01:39:58.084
If we want to keep the castle,
we have no other choice.

01:39:59.124 --> 01:40:02.644
Have can we give all that?
What authority would we have left?

01:40:04.564 --> 01:40:06.684
First, we pay, Ekaterina.

01:40:10.844 --> 01:40:12.964
Then we wait.

01:40:31.684 --> 01:40:34.524
What is the meaning of this?
What are you trying to do?

01:40:35.684 --> 01:40:39.604
We came here to negotiate.
I am negotiating.

01:40:41.844 --> 01:40:46.004
You're not trying to negotiate.
You're trying to ruin everything!

01:40:49.444 --> 01:40:52.084
What you're asking for
is nothing short of the entire castle.

01:40:52.604 --> 01:40:55.124
That's what I intended, Your Eminence.

01:40:57.444 --> 01:40:59.524
What if they refuse, Ertuğrul?

01:41:00.524 --> 01:41:02.964
We will lose the ransom!

01:41:03.484 --> 01:41:05.564
Then we'll come back
with our sultan's army.

01:41:07.524 --> 01:41:08.924
We will take the castle.

01:41:09.924 --> 01:41:13.924
Is our sultan's army not heading
east to fight the Ayyubis?

01:41:14.524 --> 01:41:16.324
Don't you know that?

01:41:17.524 --> 01:41:21.124
I do, Emir Sadettin. But they don't.

01:41:21.524 --> 01:41:24.484
They think our armies
are moving towards their borders.

01:41:24.844 --> 01:41:28.564
If we walk out with just the gold,
we will lose.

01:41:41.644 --> 01:41:44.044
So, you wish to pursue
the answer in politics?

01:41:47.964 --> 01:41:50.204
But don't forget, Ertuğrul.

01:41:50.844 --> 01:41:55.004
If this thing falls apart because of you,
because of your stubbornness...

01:41:55.804 --> 01:41:56.884
you will pay the price.

01:41:57.884 --> 01:42:01.044
I came here at the price of a great
many things, Emir Sadettin.

01:42:03.484 --> 01:42:05.444
It is time to get what's due to me.

01:42:07.404 --> 01:42:09.644
I hope it's worth it.

01:42:10.604 --> 01:42:11.524
I hope so.

01:42:38.724 --> 01:42:42.044
Halime Sultan, I am so happy.

01:42:42.604 --> 01:42:46.604
I hope Turgut Alp and Aslıhan's wedding
can take place very soon.

01:42:47.084 --> 01:42:50.364
-I hope so too.
-It will be good for both of them.

01:42:51.084 --> 01:42:53.884
Turgut Alp has kept to himself
for so long now.

01:42:54.844 --> 01:42:57.324
I hope they will be good for each other.

01:42:57.964 --> 01:43:00.724
Love makes the lover beautiful,
more amenable.

01:43:01.844 --> 01:43:04.524
It brings peace to the heart
and blesses the home.

01:43:05.004 --> 01:43:08.884
That is true, Halime Sultan.
I found that out through experience.

01:43:10.684 --> 01:43:13.644
I hope all our unmarried men
find that out too.

01:43:14.124 --> 01:43:15.084
Hopefully.

01:43:16.204 --> 01:43:19.084
Bamsi was often worried about Turgut Alp.

01:43:19.884 --> 01:43:23.684
He used to run off to be with him.
He couldn't stand him being all alone.

01:43:24.844 --> 01:43:27.604
Now, he won't be able to
even if he still wanted to, Hafsa.

01:43:30.404 --> 01:43:32.444
Turgut Alp will move to the Cavdar Tribe.

01:43:33.244 --> 01:43:37.644
No matter. The Cavdar Tribe is so near.
In the end, our hearts are unified.

01:43:38.204 --> 01:43:39.124
They are.

01:43:40.844 --> 01:43:44.484
Ladies, we have a huge task ahead of us.

01:43:44.844 --> 01:43:47.324
We have a wedding to prepare for.

01:43:47.444 --> 01:43:49.084
We can do it together.

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:54.044
I saw how you helped each other
during my wedding. I was envious.

01:43:54.364 --> 01:43:57.164
God willing, I'll be able to help
in the same way this time.

01:43:57.364 --> 01:44:00.084
We will ensure it goes
off without a hitch.

01:44:00.524 --> 01:44:03.084
People will bring
whatever they have to offer.

01:44:04.604 --> 01:44:08.124
Ladies, I suggest we help with
Aslıhan Hatun's dowry too.

01:44:08.884 --> 01:44:10.324
She's been through a lot.

01:44:10.884 --> 01:44:14.124
She won't have had any time
to prepare anything herself.

01:44:14.564 --> 01:44:16.564
-Right.
-You are right.

01:44:17.364 --> 01:44:19.764
Just standing next to her will help.

01:44:20.084 --> 01:44:22.764
-Come on, then. We have a lot to do.
-Come on.

01:44:23.084 --> 01:44:24.204
<i>Bismillah.</i>

01:44:29.084 --> 01:44:33.244
Your demands will batter our empire
both materially and morally, but...

01:44:34.084 --> 01:44:36.604
our desire for peace is total.

01:44:37.244 --> 01:44:39.644
You've gotten
what you wanted, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:44:43.604 --> 01:44:45.444
Every demand?

01:44:47.124 --> 01:44:48.844
Every single one.

01:44:52.484 --> 01:44:54.244
But I do have something to ask of you.

01:44:55.404 --> 01:44:57.124
All you may ask for is your life.

01:45:02.684 --> 01:45:05.124
If you do everything
we say without delay...

01:45:08.364 --> 01:45:09.844
we will honor your wish.

01:45:12.164 --> 01:45:15.644
Ertuğrul Bey... I understand your anger.

01:45:17.244 --> 01:45:19.404
Many warriors on both sides
fell in this war.

01:45:20.324 --> 01:45:24.284
But if the terms of this agreement
aren't followed, there will be many more.

01:45:25.724 --> 01:45:26.844
What is it you ask for?

01:45:46.524 --> 01:45:47.444
Trust.

01:45:51.124 --> 01:45:52.684
I ask you to trust me.

01:45:56.084 --> 01:45:58.484
Everyone you saw as your foe has fallen.

01:46:00.084 --> 01:46:03.404
Simon, the governor, Vasilius.

01:46:05.004 --> 01:46:09.364
None took into account the one thing
sharper than the sword: honor.

01:46:11.804 --> 01:46:13.724
I give you my hand in friendship.

01:46:24.724 --> 01:46:29.124
If honor is what you prize,
you ride under the wrong banner.

01:46:31.684 --> 01:46:32.764
I have no trust.

01:46:34.044 --> 01:46:37.364
Not in you,
nor anyone associated with you.

01:46:41.884 --> 01:46:44.484
But know that I will not be dishonest.

01:46:49.044 --> 01:46:51.804
If you are cruel...

01:46:52.684 --> 01:46:54.284
I will turn against you.

01:46:56.804 --> 01:46:59.044
Cruelty is the armor of cowards,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:46:59.524 --> 01:47:02.164
I came into this world naked
and will leave it naked.

01:47:05.124 --> 01:47:10.124
You have a month
to abide by the terms of the agreement.

01:47:14.004 --> 01:47:16.084
It will be done, Emir Sadettin.

01:47:17.684 --> 01:47:20.964
I will personally ensure we meet the terms
of the agreement and your wishes.

01:48:05.524 --> 01:48:06.724
May it be good.

01:48:08.404 --> 01:48:09.564
I hope it is.

01:48:17.884 --> 01:48:22.324
Don't make the mistake Vasilius made
and try to play games.

01:48:23.924 --> 01:48:26.844
We are in this situation because Vasilius
underestimated you, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:48:27.524 --> 01:48:29.644
{\an8}Rest assured I will not
make the same mistake.

01:48:47.165 --> 01:48:48.685
The agreement must be broken at once.

01:48:49.285 --> 01:48:51.125
I don't know how long I can take this.

01:48:52.005 --> 01:48:54.765
Even Emir Sadettin found it hard
to believe we agreed to the terms.

01:48:55.005 --> 01:48:56.725
It's too much, even for them.

01:48:57.325 --> 01:49:00.125
We're going to break it
without handing over a single gold coin.

01:50:07.725 --> 01:50:09.005
My brave father...

01:50:12.485 --> 01:50:14.405
I accepted whatever you said...

01:50:15.805 --> 01:50:17.525
so as not to oppose you.

01:50:20.685 --> 01:50:23.085
But my brother Ural poisoned you.

01:50:28.525 --> 01:50:34.605
Now, I will do my utmost to stay loyal
to my brother Aliyar's legacy,

01:50:35.125 --> 01:50:39.805
and preserve the tribe
you fought so hard to establish.

01:50:42.765 --> 01:50:44.645
I agreed to marry that man...

01:50:46.045 --> 01:50:49.085
to stay loyal to your memories...

01:50:51.765 --> 01:50:53.565
and ensure our tribes remain united.

01:50:58.245 --> 01:51:02.845
I know if my brother Aliyar was here
he would support the decision I made.

01:51:06.405 --> 01:51:07.325
However...

01:51:09.325 --> 01:51:11.405
I will need your forgiveness, Father.

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:27.245
These are significant
concessions, my Sultan.

01:51:33.805 --> 01:51:35.165
This is a victory.

01:51:41.605 --> 01:51:42.845
Money alone

01:51:43.125 --> 01:51:46.965
will not enough to relieve those
Muslims who are suffering, Sadettin.

01:51:49.325 --> 01:51:55.565
We fight in the name of God's justice,
not for gold. Don't you know that?

01:51:59.645 --> 01:52:03.565
And the emperor will no doubt
break the agreement

01:52:03.725 --> 01:52:06.725
the moment he believes
we are in any way weakened.

01:52:09.845 --> 01:52:11.045
It isn't only the Nicaea Empire,

01:52:11.805 --> 01:52:15.845
the whole world is waiting
for us to be wounded.

01:52:16.525 --> 01:52:20.205
Gold will be no use to us
when they appear on our borders.

01:52:21.085 --> 01:52:23.845
There is cruelty
in every corner of the world.

01:52:24.645 --> 01:52:28.445
That's the reason why our march
to the east is so necessary, my Sultan.

01:52:29.125 --> 01:52:34.125
Our state is capable of handling
both the Mongols and the Ayyubid Dynasty.

01:52:36.125 --> 01:52:38.645
May God make you victorious
on your campaign, my Sultan.

01:52:39.725 --> 01:52:41.965
On our campaign, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:52:43.845 --> 01:52:46.005
I want you to join the war, too.

01:52:55.085 --> 01:52:57.005
I am entrusting to you and your warriors

01:52:57.325 --> 01:53:01.925
the defence of our eastern borders
when I march against the Ayyubid Dynasty.

01:53:02.525 --> 01:53:06.485
You will repel any possible
attacks by the Mongols

01:53:06.685 --> 01:53:09.165
while I'm away dealing with the Ayyubids.

01:53:10.005 --> 01:53:14.805
As you command, my Sultan.
They shall not pass.

01:53:19.885 --> 01:53:22.645
But... have no fear
for what you leave behind.

01:53:24.085 --> 01:53:29.765
Emir Sadettin will take care
of these lands until we return.

01:53:30.125 --> 01:53:32.205
As you command, my Sultan.

01:53:36.445 --> 01:53:41.045
Until Ertuğrul Bey comes back,
these lands will be safe in my hands.

01:53:48.845 --> 01:53:52.245
I'll inform the Turk tribes
and gather our best alps, my Sultan.

01:53:52.565 --> 01:53:56.005
They will be honored to fight
under your banner.

01:53:56.605 --> 01:54:00.885
I have no doubts about the loyalty
and competence of our brave warriors.

01:54:01.645 --> 01:54:04.805
Our country will rise up
upon the shoulders of these brave men.

01:54:06.325 --> 01:54:09.605
Take all necessary precautions
and prepare your men, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:54:10.765 --> 01:54:12.045
Yes, my Sultan.

01:54:16.245 --> 01:54:18.325
We will meet them on Kurt Hill...

01:54:19.045 --> 01:54:21.405
and make our way from there
to our eastern borders.

01:54:22.925 --> 01:54:24.325
Ertuğrul Bey<i>...</i>

01:54:25.885 --> 01:54:29.725
In the time I have known you,
you have never disappointed me.

01:54:31.965 --> 01:54:33.445
I believe appointing you as margrave

01:54:33.605 --> 01:54:37.005
was the right decision
and one that will benefit our state.

01:54:39.285 --> 01:54:41.845
May your cunning
be as sharp as your sword.

01:54:42.685 --> 01:54:46.125
May our unity last forever
and may our army be victorious.

01:54:47.605 --> 01:54:48.645
Amen.

01:54:53.045 --> 01:54:54.525
May God help you in your endeavors.

01:54:55.245 --> 01:54:59.445
Henceforth, I entrust you with
the responsibility to make decisions.

01:55:17.725 --> 01:55:19.285
I will never forget this day.

01:55:21.565 --> 01:55:24.405
The concessions we were forced to make
because of the stupidity of a commander

01:55:24.485 --> 01:55:25.885
have taught me something important.

01:55:28.165 --> 01:55:29.805
Never underestimate your enemy,

01:55:31.605 --> 01:55:33.245
and always fight honorably.

01:55:34.485 --> 01:55:37.245
Those responsible are
buried in the ground now.

01:55:37.965 --> 01:55:40.565
It's we who have to suffer
the consequences.

01:55:42.045 --> 01:55:44.165
The Turks have stopped for now, Ekaterina.

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:46.845
But you should hurry.

01:55:48.245 --> 01:55:50.285
Your emperor chose you for a task.

01:55:51.085 --> 01:55:53.645
Remember, your rights were
granted to you for this purpose.

01:55:55.445 --> 01:55:58.205
We are not the only ones
who want Ertuğrul dead.

01:55:59.405 --> 01:56:01.285
We'll do it together.

01:56:02.205 --> 01:56:04.125
Choose your allies carefully.

01:56:05.405 --> 01:56:10.725
Remember... If Ertuğrul doesn't die
you lose all your privileges.

01:56:11.125 --> 01:56:12.565
I've already lost what's important.

01:56:13.045 --> 01:56:16.085
I have nothing to fear
and nothing to lose.

01:56:28.245 --> 01:56:31.045
The problem of Karacahisar Castle
has been dealt with.

01:56:31.445 --> 01:56:36.325
Thanks to the agreement we struck
Karacahisar is no longer a threat to us.

01:56:37.325 --> 01:56:39.525
God bless your efforts, son.

01:56:40.765 --> 01:56:45.085
You deserve this victory.
God bless you in your battles.

01:56:45.725 --> 01:56:46.725
Thank you, Mother.

01:56:47.245 --> 01:56:52.045
May God watch over you, my Bey<i>.</i>
May your victories be everlasting.

01:56:56.045 --> 01:56:58.925
But there is something even
more pressing we have to deal with.

01:57:00.485 --> 01:57:03.045
What is it, son?
You've only just got back.

01:57:03.565 --> 01:57:05.405
Who else is there to oppose you?

01:57:07.045 --> 01:57:10.565
Mother, the Ayyubids' army
is marching towards our borders.

01:57:13.005 --> 01:57:15.325
It's a threat to our state.

01:57:18.165 --> 01:57:20.005
Our Sultan is marching to meet them.

01:57:21.285 --> 01:57:23.605
He wants the Turkmen tribes
to act as the front line

01:57:23.965 --> 01:57:28.485
along the eastern borders
while he is away.

01:57:29.005 --> 01:57:30.565
What are you saying, my Bey?

01:57:31.845 --> 01:57:35.885
We promised to endure any pain
and hardship for our state, Halime Hatun.

01:57:53.765 --> 01:57:55.765
-Turgut.
-Yes, my Bey.

01:57:56.205 --> 01:57:59.525
Send Gunkut, Samsa, Dumrul
and Abdurrahman to the Turkmen tribes.

01:58:00.405 --> 01:58:02.725
Have them gather their best alps<i>.</i>

01:58:03.085 --> 01:58:06.605
You go to the Cavdar Tribe.
Take some of Aslıhan Hatun's alps<i>.</i>

01:58:07.485 --> 01:58:09.085
We rendezvous at Kurt Hill tomorrow.

01:58:11.525 --> 01:58:14.205
We will have to postpone your marriage.

01:58:14.925 --> 01:58:17.845
-Let Aslıhan Hatun know.
-As you command, my Bey.

01:58:21.485 --> 01:58:25.325
Dundar Bey<i>, </i>you will act as Bey
of the tribe in my absence.

01:58:29.325 --> 01:58:32.765
Artuk Bey... you will be coming with me.

01:58:33.565 --> 01:58:34.605
As you command, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:58:34.885 --> 01:58:38.965
I want you by my side not just for your
bravery but because of your experience.

01:58:40.205 --> 01:58:41.885
I'd die for you, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:58:43.365 --> 01:58:47.845
Brother... I wish I could come
and fight alongside you.

01:58:49.405 --> 01:58:53.445
The tribe needs a bey, Dundar,
you know that.

01:58:56.765 --> 01:59:00.405
-The tribe is your responsibility.
-Have no fear on that score, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:59:40.725 --> 01:59:42.005
Dear God...

01:59:47.125 --> 01:59:50.605
-What is this, Eminence?
-Out!

02:00:05.925 --> 02:00:07.405
What do you think you are doing?

02:00:10.325 --> 02:00:13.045
You have already made a fool of me
and now you distract

02:00:13.245 --> 02:00:17.045
our sultan at this
vital time with this matter?

02:00:18.525 --> 02:00:24.685
I have nothing to hide from anyone.
Our sultan wanted to know about it.

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:29.525
The place for it is right here.
It cannot leave here.

02:00:31.245 --> 02:00:34.645
Are you going to keep on
humiliating me, Aslihan?

02:00:35.525 --> 02:00:39.965
I'm not trying to humiliate anyone!
Do not think to take your anger out on me!

02:00:48.405 --> 02:00:51.645
You convinced our sultan and sought to...

02:00:52.965 --> 02:00:55.205
use him against me, right?

02:00:56.525 --> 02:01:00.005
So, what will you do
when our sultan marches away?

02:01:12.725 --> 02:01:14.245
You didn't know, did you?

02:01:18.365 --> 02:01:19.605
And what about Ertuğrul?

02:01:22.125 --> 02:01:24.645
He was supposed to protect you, right?

02:01:27.725 --> 02:01:30.205
Alas, he is also marching away.

02:01:32.325 --> 02:01:36.205
And... no one knows if or
when they'll ever come back.

02:01:54.045 --> 02:01:58.205
May God aid our warriors in their battles.

02:02:00.045 --> 02:02:04.245
I don't fear anyone but God.

02:02:05.085 --> 02:02:11.885
I have never looked to anyone for support
except for God's holy support--

02:02:12.045 --> 02:02:14.285
I made you an offer,

02:02:15.925 --> 02:02:17.965
and it's still on the table.

02:02:23.165 --> 02:02:25.805
Stop being stubborn
and just choose a bey for your tribe.

02:02:31.045 --> 02:02:32.485
Let me help you.

02:02:33.045 --> 02:02:36.045
Let me conclude our marriage.

02:02:36.165 --> 02:02:38.885
There is no such thing as
"our marriage", Eminence.

02:02:41.405 --> 02:02:47.165
Ertuğrul Bey, with God's help,
had Turgut Alp ask for my hand.

02:02:49.005 --> 02:02:50.165
And you said?

02:02:51.045 --> 02:02:53.525
Turgut Alp and I are to be married.

02:02:53.845 --> 02:02:58.285
If he marches to war,
then I will wait for him to return.

02:03:02.285 --> 02:03:04.525
And you should give up on this delusion.

02:03:08.285 --> 02:03:10.965
You don't realize what you're saying.

02:03:13.005 --> 02:03:14.005
You...

02:03:17.405 --> 02:03:20.885
You don't realize what you are saying!

02:04:16.125 --> 02:04:20.565
God, please protect me and my loved ones

02:04:21.005 --> 02:04:23.365
from this man's rage.

02:04:29.965 --> 02:04:31.605
Eminence!

02:04:58.525 --> 02:05:00.565
-Are you all right? Healer!
-Stop!

02:05:04.725 --> 02:05:06.245
I don't need anyone.

02:05:14.045 --> 02:05:15.525
Listen to me, Cabir...

02:05:17.925 --> 02:05:23.485
Send a messenger
to Karacahisar Castle at once.

02:05:24.685 --> 02:05:25.805
Yes, sir.

02:05:27.085 --> 02:05:30.605
-To whom, exactly?
-To Ekaterina.

02:05:32.605 --> 02:05:35.565
The message will be
Ertuğrul's death sentence.

02:06:14.005 --> 02:06:17.005
-May I come in?
-Come in, son.

02:06:22.885 --> 02:06:25.245
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

02:06:36.485 --> 02:06:41.285
As you know, at our sultan's invitation,
we are to march to the east.

02:06:43.085 --> 02:06:45.485
You know, it's time for war.

02:06:46.605 --> 02:06:50.165
I'm here to ask for your prayers
and your blessings.

02:06:53.565 --> 02:06:56.725
Those who carry good intentions
will secure a good outcome, son.

02:06:58.885 --> 02:07:00.805
Our prayers are with you.

02:07:01.845 --> 02:07:04.045
If I have blessings to give,
you have them.

02:07:05.285 --> 02:07:08.405
We've made many memories
over the years we've spent together.

02:07:10.125 --> 02:07:13.125
You should give me your blessings, too.

02:07:13.205 --> 02:07:15.725
Of course, you have my blessings.

02:07:18.885 --> 02:07:23.085
God does not leave alone those
who embrace his cause, son.

02:07:24.165 --> 02:07:26.605
You want to wave
the glorious flag of Islam

02:07:27.045 --> 02:07:31.445
in every corner of the world.

02:07:32.285 --> 02:07:36.805
You aim to provide justice
and eliminate cruelty.

02:07:37.405 --> 02:07:40.365
God will certainly be on your side.

02:07:41.405 --> 02:07:44.565
God says in the story of The Heifer,

02:07:45.965 --> 02:07:49.845
"Fighting has been enjoined upon you
while it is hateful to you.

02:07:50.765 --> 02:07:54.405
But perhaps you hate a thing
and it is good for you;

02:07:55.645 --> 02:08:00.565
and perhaps you love a thing
and it is bad for you.

02:08:01.565 --> 02:08:04.565
And God Knows, while you know not."

02:08:06.765 --> 02:08:10.085
Our prophet trusted only in God

02:08:10.405 --> 02:08:14.245
when he was travelling to Medina.

02:08:15.325 --> 02:08:19.405
And God did not leave him alone.

02:08:19.845 --> 02:08:23.085
He protected him
with the web of a spider.

02:08:24.525 --> 02:08:26.885
You too should count on God's help.

02:08:27.805 --> 02:08:33.405
Your march will shine like a beacon
of hope to the oppressed.

02:08:34.405 --> 02:08:37.845
You'll be the protector
of innocent children,

02:08:38.645 --> 02:08:41.885
crying mothers and the poor.

02:08:42.845 --> 02:08:47.525
Be a servant to your holy cause
so that you may be glorious.

02:08:48.485 --> 02:08:53.005
But remember, son, it is being a servant
of God which is itself glorious.

02:08:56.845 --> 02:09:01.245
Use your power to frighten only the cruel.

02:09:02.125 --> 02:09:03.925
To provide hope to the oppressed.

02:09:04.725 --> 02:09:07.365
To spread justice in the world.

02:09:08.245 --> 02:09:10.765
To rise against cruelty.

02:09:12.045 --> 02:09:19.045
And always remember these verses
from The Family of Imran.

02:09:20.045 --> 02:09:26.165
"Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate
after You have guided us,

02:09:26.765 --> 02:09:28.805
and grant us from your mercy.

02:09:30.565 --> 02:09:33.525
Indeed, you are the bestower."

02:09:43.645 --> 02:09:46.885
May you have good fortune
and may God help you

02:09:47.045 --> 02:09:49.165
in all your endeavors, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

02:09:56.405 --> 02:09:57.765
God bless you.

02:10:11.165 --> 02:10:12.165
Bamsi.

02:10:14.285 --> 02:10:17.165
How will my heart
endure your absence, Bamsi?

02:10:19.925 --> 02:10:23.205
I'll be left incomplete when you leave.

02:10:23.925 --> 02:10:27.325
You'll get used to it.
You'll get used to it.

02:10:28.085 --> 02:10:32.885
You'll endure it. I'll go
and come back before you know it.

02:10:36.725 --> 02:10:38.845
It's hard to get used to it, Bamsi.

02:10:40.685 --> 02:10:42.165
There seems always to be a battle.

02:10:43.085 --> 02:10:45.005
When you leave in the morning

02:10:45.245 --> 02:10:48.485
I know you'll be back
in the evening and I wait for you.

02:10:49.645 --> 02:10:51.925
This time no one knows
when you'll be back.

02:10:52.165 --> 02:10:53.725
How can I bear it?

02:10:54.725 --> 02:10:58.645
My beloved Hafsa... My beloved.
Please don't be sad.

02:11:00.325 --> 02:11:03.205
Come here, come, my Hafsa...

02:11:04.325 --> 02:11:05.685
Come here.

02:11:07.325 --> 02:11:14.045
Hafsa, I know our being apart is hard.
But we will be together again soon.

02:11:17.765 --> 02:11:20.205
My Hafsa, barbarians are on our borders.

02:11:21.605 --> 02:11:26.205
If we don't force them back
many innocents will die.

02:11:27.245 --> 02:11:31.325
Patience is a sour thing,
but its fruit is sweet.

02:11:32.685 --> 02:11:36.125
Bamsi, what if something happens to you?

02:11:37.205 --> 02:11:41.285
I can't live without you.
I have no one else, Bamsi.

02:11:42.845 --> 02:11:46.725
Don't talk like that.
Would I ever leave you alone?

02:11:49.085 --> 02:11:53.525
I'll be back before you know it.
Please don't worry.

02:12:04.765 --> 02:12:08.405
-My lady, may I enter?
-Yes.

02:12:16.245 --> 02:12:21.365
My lady, a messenger brought this.
He wouldn't say who it's from.

02:12:36.885 --> 02:12:41.885
<i>Ertuğrul will be on Kurt Hill tomorrow.</i>
<i>Have him experience hell on that hill.</i>

02:12:43.725 --> 02:12:45.045
Emir Sadettin.

02:12:48.725 --> 02:12:50.485
<i>I know it's you.</i>

02:13:07.565 --> 02:13:09.405
May I come in, Aslıhan Hatun?

02:13:10.405 --> 02:13:11.525
Come in, Kirca.

02:13:25.725 --> 02:13:27.085
Welcome, Turgut Alp.

02:13:28.845 --> 02:13:31.525
-Thank you, Aslıhan Hatun.
-Please sit.

02:13:33.485 --> 02:13:36.285
Thank you. But I have
something important to say.

02:13:38.085 --> 02:13:41.845
Our Sultan has marched his army
against the Ayyubids.

02:13:42.405 --> 02:13:45.845
The alps of the Turk tribes
will act as an advance guard

02:13:46.005 --> 02:13:48.525
under Ertuğrul Bey's
command against the Mongols.

02:13:49.525 --> 02:13:54.605
We would like the alps of the Cavdar Tribe
to join us if you will permit it.

02:13:55.725 --> 02:14:01.205
The wishes of our Sultan and of
Ertuğrul Bey are orders I live to fulfil.

02:14:02.085 --> 02:14:06.565
I had the warriors get ready
as soon as I heard about the march.

02:14:10.245 --> 02:14:12.005
When did you learn about the march?

02:14:14.005 --> 02:14:15.285
Emir Sadettin told me.

02:14:21.045 --> 02:14:23.125
He has a loose tongue.

02:14:25.085 --> 02:14:27.365
I hope he didn't say anything
to upset you.

02:14:30.525 --> 02:14:34.365
Don't worry. His words can't upset me.

02:14:36.005 --> 02:14:37.205
Put your mind at rest.

02:14:38.885 --> 02:14:39.845
Very well.

02:14:45.285 --> 02:14:48.965
Ertuğrul Bey says we should
postpone our wedding ceremony,

02:14:49.765 --> 02:14:51.485
if you agree to it.

02:14:52.845 --> 02:14:54.965
Ertuğrul Bey thought correctly.

02:14:55.525 --> 02:14:58.725
We'll do what's required
when you come back.

02:15:01.005 --> 02:15:04.005
Then if you will excuse me,
I'd like to check on the warriors.

02:15:05.005 --> 02:15:07.085
Kirca will show you the way.

02:15:14.845 --> 02:15:16.085
Guards!

02:15:27.405 --> 02:15:30.885
Sir, news has arrived
from our scouts at the inn.

02:15:31.445 --> 02:15:34.205
The sultan is on his way
to Konya with his army.

02:15:38.165 --> 02:15:39.525
You can leave.

02:15:48.285 --> 02:15:50.805
So, the sultan took a big
bite out of us and left.

02:15:51.805 --> 02:15:53.245
Isn't that what we wanted?

02:15:53.725 --> 02:15:56.325
I won't get what I want
until Ertuğrul dies, Ekaterina.

02:15:57.165 --> 02:16:00.685
I will deliver Ertuğrul's head to you
without disrupting the peace.

02:16:02.405 --> 02:16:05.645
Without disrupting the peace... how?

02:16:05.925 --> 02:16:07.445
The time has come.

02:16:08.325 --> 02:16:11.205
Ertuğrul will go to Kurt Hill
near Konya tomorrow.

02:16:12.245 --> 02:16:15.485
Right after the sultan...
What are they up to?

02:16:16.045 --> 02:16:17.325
It's up to you to find out.

02:16:18.005 --> 02:16:21.285
Just as it's up to you to
send Ertuğrul straight to hell.

02:16:22.165 --> 02:16:25.005
You will be his executioner.

02:16:26.005 --> 02:16:27.285
How did you find out about this?

02:16:28.605 --> 02:16:30.645
I was told of it by someone I trust.

02:16:31.165 --> 02:16:33.045
How do we know your contact
is trustworthy?

02:16:33.365 --> 02:16:37.525
Because he wants Ertuğrul dead
more than anyone.

02:16:40.205 --> 02:16:41.245
Who?

02:16:42.125 --> 02:16:45.005
You'll know who they are
when you finally learn to trust me.

02:17:00.445 --> 02:17:02.205
May I come in, Aslıhan Hatun?

02:17:04.965 --> 02:17:06.045
Come in, Turgut Alp<i>.</i>

02:17:19.125 --> 02:17:23.885
I've been expecting you.
I had a guest tent made ready for you.

02:17:24.685 --> 02:17:26.165
You should rest tonight.

02:17:27.525 --> 02:17:29.805
Thank you, Aslıhan Hatun. Thank you.

02:17:30.725 --> 02:17:37.045
I talked to the alps<i>. </i>They are
as sharp as a sword and just as brave.

02:17:37.965 --> 02:17:42.285
They're all excited at the prospect
of fighting alongside Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

02:17:43.445 --> 02:17:47.325
I understand their enthusiasm,
they'll be with their brothers once more

02:17:47.645 --> 02:17:49.285
and fighting alongside them.

02:17:50.805 --> 02:17:52.565
I chose unmarried warriors.

02:17:53.645 --> 02:17:55.365
If anything should happen to them

02:17:55.805 --> 02:18:00.525
they will leave no wives behind,
waiting for their return.

02:18:02.485 --> 02:18:03.805
Except for you.

02:18:11.045 --> 02:18:12.925
It's been a long time
since someone waited for me.

02:18:14.165 --> 02:18:18.045
I know very well what it's like
to wait and then to lose.

02:18:21.005 --> 02:18:22.325
But you made the right decision.

02:18:24.685 --> 02:18:27.085
We'll be on our way first thing tomorrow.

02:18:28.885 --> 02:18:31.965
-Excuse me.
-Turgut Alp<i>.</i>

02:18:50.125 --> 02:18:51.645
This dagger is for you.

02:18:52.965 --> 02:18:55.205
I'd like you to have it.

02:19:31.205 --> 02:19:32.965
Thank you, Aslıhan Hatun.

02:19:36.045 --> 02:19:42.485
This dagger... will remind me
someone is waiting for me.

02:19:54.045 --> 02:19:55.365
I'm grateful.

02:20:00.005 --> 02:20:01.245
Guards!

02:20:23.845 --> 02:20:25.245
My boy!

02:20:27.085 --> 02:20:30.325
I hope you come back safe and sound.

02:20:31.165 --> 02:20:34.765
May God help you and protect you.

02:20:44.965 --> 02:20:48.365
Come back safe and sound. God bless you.

02:20:49.285 --> 02:20:51.405
Protect each other.

02:21:23.005 --> 02:21:23.965
My Halime...

02:21:29.605 --> 02:21:32.445
Whenever you send me into battle
with tears in your eyes,

02:21:33.005 --> 02:21:36.525
I leave a part of me here.
I can't think straight.

02:21:39.605 --> 02:21:43.125
I'm strong,
but my heart is soft, Ertuğrul.

02:21:44.965 --> 02:21:49.125
Don't you understand? I'm in love.
I'll miss you.

02:21:49.885 --> 02:21:54.565
I'll cry, I'll wait,
but I'll stay patient.

02:21:58.605 --> 02:22:00.805
May my tears be your comrades.

02:22:02.605 --> 02:22:04.405
May my love be your shield.

02:22:09.125 --> 02:22:13.165
May the blue skies be your friend
and the brown soil your companion.

02:22:14.805 --> 02:22:18.325
Share your secrets with them
until I come back.

02:22:21.405 --> 02:22:25.325
If you listen to the wind...
you'll hear me.

02:22:30.005 --> 02:22:32.005
The rain will pour my love for you.

02:22:49.845 --> 02:22:51.005
My Halime.

02:22:52.765 --> 02:22:56.085
I entrust my children and my home to you.

02:22:58.445 --> 02:23:02.285
You are the bearer of life, a mother.

02:23:02.965 --> 02:23:07.125
You are the beloved one.
You are God's gift to me.

02:23:08.245 --> 02:23:11.325
Be patient and stay strong.

02:23:16.205 --> 02:23:18.885
May God protect you, Ertuğrul.

02:23:20.885 --> 02:23:23.325
I know he will protect you.

02:23:24.965 --> 02:23:27.605
He will send you back to my arms.

02:23:43.005 --> 02:23:47.645
Father, I'm ready!
Mother, we're going on a march.

02:23:53.405 --> 02:23:57.365
Who will protect your mother
if you come with me?

02:23:58.365 --> 02:24:00.005
Who will protect our tribe?

02:24:00.325 --> 02:24:02.645
I talked to the alps<i>,</i>
they will protect it.

02:24:05.725 --> 02:24:08.525
No, you've not to leave your mother alone.

02:24:09.685 --> 02:24:13.325
You are to lead the tribe while I'm away.

02:24:14.645 --> 02:24:17.485
When will we go
and fight together, Father?

02:24:17.965 --> 02:24:23.045
We'll go to war together
when Savci has grown up.

02:24:53.925 --> 02:24:56.005
May God deliver you from evil, Halime.

02:25:38.085 --> 02:25:39.165
Gündüz.

02:25:50.525 --> 02:25:51.845
Come back safe to us.

02:25:59.765 --> 02:26:02.805
-Thank you, my boy.
-Protect my sons.

02:26:03.285 --> 02:26:06.045
May God protect our sons.

02:26:09.005 --> 02:26:10.285
Come on, brother.

02:26:10.925 --> 02:26:14.845
-May God help you.
-Come back...

02:26:23.725 --> 02:26:25.765
-May you be victorious.
-Amen.

02:26:26.885 --> 02:26:30.485
Dear God, protect these brave men
fighting for your cause.

02:26:32.925 --> 02:26:38.485
Spare them for their
families and children.

02:26:42.165 --> 02:26:45.045
Live long, brave warriors.

02:26:52.845 --> 02:26:55.525
-May God help you.
-Come back safe and sound.

02:26:57.205 --> 02:27:00.445
May God protect our Ertuğrul Bey.

02:27:16.005 --> 02:27:17.885
To the parents who send their sons...

02:27:18.805 --> 02:27:22.605
to be martyrs, if that's what it takes,
know this...

02:27:24.885 --> 02:27:26.925
God sees everything

02:27:28.245 --> 02:27:30.685
and he is aware of your sacrifice.

02:27:33.965 --> 02:27:38.165
We live to spread the justice of God.

02:27:39.805 --> 02:27:43.245
We know our dying
is to come together with God.

02:27:44.765 --> 02:27:45.925
But we will live.

02:27:49.445 --> 02:27:52.325
For God, for the state.

02:27:53.125 --> 02:27:54.925
For our traditions.

02:27:57.645 --> 02:28:00.725
If we live, our state lives.

02:28:01.805 --> 02:28:05.125
If we live, our traditions live.

02:28:06.125 --> 02:28:10.165
If we live, our tribe lives.

02:28:13.005 --> 02:28:17.605
We will oppress the sound of cruelty.

02:28:18.925 --> 02:28:22.765
We will make those brutes
kneel before our swords.

02:28:25.725 --> 02:28:29.685
Our faith will shake the earth.

02:28:31.565 --> 02:28:33.565
We have one arrow for every heathen

02:28:34.605 --> 02:28:37.085
and a thousand warriors
to protect us from their one arrow.

02:28:40.285 --> 02:28:44.405
We are Turks.
We have been never afraid.

02:28:45.205 --> 02:28:47.285
And we will not ever be afraid.

02:28:47.405 --> 02:28:48.565
We will not!

02:28:48.765 --> 02:28:51.285
-We will not give up!
-We will not give up!

02:28:51.405 --> 02:28:53.645
-We will succeed!
-We will succeed!

02:28:53.725 --> 02:28:56.525
<i>-Allahuakbar!</i>
<i>-Allahuakbar!</i>

02:28:56.605 --> 02:28:58.205
<i>Allahuakbar!</i>

02:28:59.845 --> 02:29:01.245
<i>Allahuakbar!</i>

02:29:02.845 --> 02:29:04.205
<i>Allahuakbar!</i>

02:29:05.885 --> 02:29:08.885
<i>Allahuakbar! Allahuakbar!</i>

02:29:09.125 --> 02:29:12.245
<i>Allahuakbar! Allahuakbar!</i>

02:29:15.085 --> 02:29:18.205
-Take care of the tribe, Dundar.
-May God protect you, brother.

02:29:20.485 --> 02:29:21.565
Thank you.

02:29:34.405 --> 02:29:39.245
I have such a brave son
that even the skies envy me.

02:29:40.285 --> 02:29:42.885
I have such a brave son...

02:29:43.965 --> 02:29:48.165
that I can't give enough blessings to you.
You deserve more than I can give.

02:29:50.645 --> 02:29:52.645
Go on, son. Go.

02:29:53.365 --> 02:29:55.085
Go on if our state is to live on,

02:29:56.165 --> 02:29:59.685
if the enemy are not to walk
upon the soil of our state,

02:30:00.725 --> 02:30:06.125
if our flag is to wave freely. Go on, son.

02:30:08.125 --> 02:30:09.605
Be a martyr if that's what it takes.

02:30:13.085 --> 02:30:18.245
We won't shed a single tear
even if our hearts cry a river.

02:30:21.685 --> 02:30:25.565
Mother, pray for me.

02:30:26.725 --> 02:30:28.325
Your prayers will be my shield.

02:31:22.805 --> 02:31:25.245
-Come back safe.
-May God watch over you.

02:31:45.845 --> 02:31:49.285
Come on, Alps! A battle awaits us!

02:33:02.245 --> 02:33:04.125
Brave warriors of Cavdar tribe,

02:33:05.445 --> 02:33:08.685
I know each one of you volunteered
to go on this march.

02:33:09.925 --> 02:33:12.845
I have no doubt that the warriors
of the Cavdar tribe will act bravely

02:33:13.005 --> 02:33:15.125
under the command of Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

02:33:16.885 --> 02:33:19.805
Many other Turk tribes
will accompany you in this march

02:33:20.285 --> 02:33:23.605
and victory will bring power
for our state and honor to our tribe.

02:33:24.405 --> 02:33:27.085
May God bless us in this battle.

02:33:27.645 --> 02:33:29.125
Amen!

02:33:31.325 --> 02:33:32.325
Amen.

02:33:33.285 --> 02:33:36.965
I will pray for you,
I will pray that you come back

02:33:37.245 --> 02:33:39.045
to your loved ones as soon as possible.

02:33:45.005 --> 02:33:46.285
Turgut, Master Alp,

02:33:48.525 --> 02:33:50.405
I entrust these brave warriors to you.

02:33:51.005 --> 02:33:53.605
They are first entrusted to God,

02:33:54.325 --> 02:33:56.365
and second to Ertuğrul Bey, Aslıhan Hatun.

02:33:59.325 --> 02:34:00.445
Alps!

02:35:55.965 --> 02:35:59.965
My Bey, this looks like
the work of bandits.

02:36:00.845 --> 02:36:02.445
They ambushed these poor people.

02:36:05.325 --> 02:36:09.565
There are wounded people here, my Bey.
Let me have a look at them.

02:36:10.485 --> 02:36:13.485
Keep on your guard. Alps!

02:36:14.925 --> 02:36:18.525
Take both sides of the road.
Ready your bows!

02:36:38.125 --> 02:36:41.445
-Be careful, Bamsi.
-Yes, my Bey.

02:37:54.925 --> 02:37:56.285
Artuk Bey!

02:41:35.965 --> 02:41:37.605
Show your face, you bastard.

02:41:41.365 --> 02:41:43.765
I will make you pay
for what you've done to my warriors.

02:43:26.925 --> 02:43:30.525
I bear witness...
that there is no god but God,

02:43:32.725 --> 02:43:35.685
and that Muhammad is his messenger...
