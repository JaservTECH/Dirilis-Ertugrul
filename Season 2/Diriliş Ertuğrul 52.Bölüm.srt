00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 52 will start after 12:05 min.

12:05.219 --> 12:09.219
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:25.099 --> 12:27.032
It has been hurting me for a long time.

12:27.466 --> 12:29.232
But I did not take it seriously.

12:30.499 --> 12:34.532
When I was getting ready to go
to caravansary, it started to ache.

12:35.166 --> 12:37.166
This boil is hurting me.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.399
Did you for your arm, Bey?

12:41.532 --> 12:44.966
Not really, we trained
with our Alps just now.

12:46.066 --> 12:49.866
I wish you did not.
You should rest immediately.

12:50.232 --> 12:53.332
And I do not know whether this boil
is benign or not.

12:53.566 --> 12:56.966
But if it is malignant,
it will show itself with fever.

12:57.566 --> 12:58.966
I cannot rest now.

12:59.132 --> 13:01.332
Amer Sadettin Kobek is waiting for me
in caravansary.

13:02.132 --> 13:04.199
So let me know when you come back
to the nomad tent.

13:06.432 --> 13:08.966
-Okay, I will, do not worry.
-Bey.

13:09.966 --> 13:11.399
Do not underestimate this boil.

13:13.232 --> 13:14.799
Thank you.

13:26.950 --> 13:29.217
God is a benevolent ambusher,
Tugtekin Bey.

13:30.084 --> 13:32.350
You saw the killer of your
mother and father.

13:33.450 --> 13:34.817
But it is not enough.

13:36.184 --> 13:39.184
Gumustekin is the one
behind these murders.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.184
But not just him.

13:42.817 --> 13:48.117
It is our duty to reveal the ones
who are undermining our Sultan and state.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.484
Save yourself.

14:08.317 --> 14:09.684
Will we not do anything, Ertugrul?

14:10.284 --> 14:13.117
Be patient, Tugtekin Bey.
Selcan Hatun is not alone.

14:34.884 --> 14:36.317
Both of you will die!

14:37.017 --> 14:38.817
Aytolun will hurt Selcan, Ertugrul.

14:39.150 --> 14:40.417
Do not worry, Tugtekin.

14:41.484 --> 14:45.150
The bow of Sungur is on them.
He will shoot if something happens.

14:46.717 --> 14:51.284
Selcan Hatun and Banu Cicek
would never give into this woman.

15:13.117 --> 15:17.850
Knowing that you are in command of the
nomad groups which has

15:18.050 --> 15:20.750
the most brave Alps gives me comfort,
Gumustekin.

15:21.417 --> 15:26.484
As long as I have the leashes of Tugtekin
and Gundogdu in my hands,

15:27.684 --> 15:32.317
It will be easier for me to control these
reckless Turkmen tribes.

15:33.784 --> 15:37.784
When you go back to Konya, you will
be busy with more things.

15:40.150 --> 15:41.884
Trust me, your highness.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.317
If God permits, Gumustekin.

15:46.384 --> 15:47.450
If God permits.

15:50.250 --> 15:56.217
But what if Mother Hayme listens to
Ertugrul and decides to stop you?

15:58.050 --> 16:00.850
I will never permit that to happen.

16:02.284 --> 16:04.817
Gundogdu will be the Bey
of Kayi tribe soon.

16:05.850 --> 16:07.484
And he is to be my son in law.

16:11.184 --> 16:14.784
Do you think Gundogdu will disobey his
mother to become margrave?

16:16.150 --> 16:17.850
Gundogdu is a decisive man

16:18.017 --> 16:20.850
who is willing to do anything
for his nomad group.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.350
He was not in the succession race

16:23.984 --> 16:28.184
just because he did not want
any conflict with his brothers.

16:28.950 --> 16:30.217
Everyone knows that.

16:32.384 --> 16:37.750
But if Ertugrul dies,
the road to his succession will be open.

16:41.317 --> 16:42.450
We will see.

16:44.684 --> 16:45.850
We will see.

16:52.050 --> 16:53.917
Gundogdu Bey is here, his highness Ameer.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.684
Invite him in.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.884
Get well soon, Gundogdu Bey.

17:08.117 --> 17:10.217
-Thank you, his highness Ameer.
-Come here.

17:13.084 --> 17:14.684
I hope nothing is wrong, Gundogdu Bey.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.184
Nothing important, Gumustekin Bey.

17:18.450 --> 17:19.750
It is a boil.

17:19.950 --> 17:22.484
I can send you a doctor from Konya
if you want.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.184
Thank you.

17:24.417 --> 17:28.050
A boil is nothing for Gundogdu Bey,
his highness Ameer.

17:28.984 --> 17:30.050
Thank you, Bey.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.717
For ten years, Sultan has been with us.

17:34.317 --> 17:36.850
-God bless our Sultan.
-Amen.

17:37.750 --> 17:38.850
Amen.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.117
Amen.

17:42.817 --> 17:45.684
But in these ten years,
I feel at ease for the first time.

17:47.817 --> 17:51.950
I am very happy to know that
these important lands

17:52.150 --> 17:56.250
that are between the trade routes
are in safe hands.

17:58.217 --> 18:03.417
My margrave on one side,
Gundogdu and Tugtekin Bey on the other.

18:05.450 --> 18:09.050
You will have our state's
never ending gratitude.

18:09.817 --> 18:12.484
-Thank you, his highness Ameer.
-Thank you.

18:13.350 --> 18:17.817
It is time to share some state secrets
with you, Gundogdu Bey.

19:06.284 --> 19:08.450
Banu Cicek, go away! You are wounded!

19:09.050 --> 19:11.150
You have to give this evidence to
Ertugrul! Go away!

19:16.984 --> 19:18.084
Give your sword to me!

19:24.417 --> 19:27.317
Tell Ertugrul Bey to find me,
he will know where I am!

19:27.717 --> 19:29.017
Come here, you wretch!

20:13.017 --> 20:14.684
Come on Selcan Hatun, go away.

20:19.917 --> 20:21.450
Not even hell will be your salvation!

20:41.350 --> 20:44.084
Selcan, I swear that you will die!

21:03.017 --> 21:07.017
Avshar tribe, Bayindir tribe,
Kargun tribe.

21:09.184 --> 21:12.484
Karaevli tribe, Bayat tribe
and Kisik tribe.

21:13.317 --> 21:14.484
And the others

21:16.117 --> 21:21.284
live in a disorderly fashion from
Ayyubid border to Georgia border.

21:22.784 --> 21:27.817
This disorder weakens the state
and nomad groups.

21:29.317 --> 21:34.750
All of the tribes are fighting against the
Mongol plague, his highness.

21:36.917 --> 21:40.217
Of course, their loses hurt all of us.

21:40.917 --> 21:46.950
But we have to be like an unshakeable
castle inside and outside.

21:50.950 --> 21:52.484
Gumustekin Bey is right.

21:54.350 --> 21:56.017
The problem is not just Mongols.

21:57.150 --> 22:02.184
Ayyubids also provoke Turkmen tribes to
rebel over and over again.

22:05.050 --> 22:08.484
Those tribes fighting against
the Mongol plague right now

22:09.317 --> 22:13.917
may become a serious threat to our state.

22:14.984 --> 22:17.384
It is essential for us to take
precautions to protect our state.

22:19.384 --> 22:23.850
I wish all nomad groups were loyal
as Dodurga and Kayi tribes.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.450
Unfortunately they are not.

22:25.784 --> 22:29.684
That is the main reason why I want to
gather Turkmen tribes under my banner.

22:32.884 --> 22:36.784
The most important thing is
to make Kayi tribe get to know us better.

22:38.217 --> 22:40.184
It will strengthen our state.

22:40.984 --> 22:44.284
But the Beys of the two nomad group
that I trust the most

22:44.450 --> 22:47.384
must be brave warriors.

22:49.150 --> 22:52.084
This goes both for Dodurga
and Kayi tribes.

22:55.217 --> 22:56.350
What I want to say is

22:57.017 --> 22:59.317
we want to see the Bey of Kayi tribe
by our side

23:00.317 --> 23:04.450
when our state needs him the most.

23:06.750 --> 23:09.317
Thank you, his highness Ameer.
You can be sure of that.

23:11.050 --> 23:16.084
Hayme Hatun is brave enough to
stand against most of the Turkmen Beys.

23:17.950 --> 23:20.050
But she is a woman nevertheless.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.450
Do you understand
where I am going with this?

23:29.884 --> 23:30.984
Gundogdu Bey.

23:33.317 --> 23:34.850
Alps are like wild horses.

23:36.050 --> 23:39.150
If a Bey does not hold his horse's
reins tight

23:40.184 --> 23:42.717
It doesn't matter how fast
or strong that horse is.

23:42.784 --> 23:45.317
It's destination will be unknown.

23:47.117 --> 23:48.117
Surely.

23:49.417 --> 23:55.250
You must hold the reins of
Kayi Alps tightly.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.317
The decision is yours, Gundogdu Bey.

24:05.184 --> 24:06.784
But you should know that

24:07.317 --> 24:10.317
his highness Ameer and I
will always be by your side.

24:11.884 --> 24:12.917
Thank you.

24:13.484 --> 24:14.984
Think about this carefully.

24:16.217 --> 24:19.184
You will make the best decision
when the time comes.

24:38.084 --> 24:39.084
Selcan!

24:40.117 --> 24:41.117
Selcan!

24:43.184 --> 24:44.184
Selcan!

24:47.950 --> 24:48.950
Selcan!

25:28.850 --> 25:30.817
Until Gumustekin falls into my trap

25:30.950 --> 25:32.917
I want you to host the killer
of your mother and father

25:33.050 --> 25:34.917
one more night in your tent.

25:38.383 --> 25:42.117
You will smile upon that ominous woman
and call her mother.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.217
You will put up with the lies
and slanders of Goncagul.

25:47.017 --> 25:48.950
You will obey to Gumustekin.

25:51.383 --> 25:56.017
Tonight, they will be so afraid
they can do everything.

25:58.783 --> 26:05.283
All you have to do is put up with the lies
they will tell to set you against us.

26:12.650 --> 26:14.383
Tonight, none of us will sleep.

26:15.283 --> 26:17.350
We are obliged to the truth, Ertugrul Bey.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.883
Selcan Hatun is returning to nomad tent
safe and sound, Ertugrul.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.983
-Do not worry.
-Thank you, brother.

26:29.817 --> 26:34.183
You saved my life once Ertugrul
and now you saved my nomad group.

26:35.650 --> 26:36.983
Your help is priceless.

26:40.150 --> 26:44.283
Our only aim is make Gumustekin
confess the truth.

26:45.617 --> 26:47.183
When we achieve this

26:47.983 --> 26:51.383
we will come up smelling like
a rose from our biggest war.

26:54.083 --> 26:55.117
Come on.

27:10.083 --> 27:11.650
Where is Selcan?

27:12.683 --> 27:14.283
She is alone with that woman.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.417
And also, Banu Cicek is wounded.

27:17.650 --> 27:18.650
Oh God!

27:20.383 --> 27:25.283
Do not worry. Relieve yourself.

27:26.850 --> 27:31.050
Ertugrul Bey and Sungurtekin Bey
will not let anything happen to Selcan.

27:31.383 --> 27:34.650
And If God permits, Tugtekin Bey
will see the truth with his eyes.

27:35.383 --> 27:36.850
If God permits, daughter.

27:37.983 --> 27:41.017
I want Selcan to come here safe and sound.

27:42.383 --> 27:45.817
They get their deserts. We will see.

27:46.983 --> 27:48.617
I want her here.

28:02.117 --> 28:04.817
<i>Where are you, aunt? Where are you?</i>

28:21.717 --> 28:23.317
-May it be easy, sister.
-Thank you.

28:24.217 --> 28:25.217
May it be easy.

28:25.283 --> 28:26.617
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

28:42.217 --> 28:43.317
Goncagul.

28:46.617 --> 28:50.617
The days that you jumped down
the nomad group's throat is over.

28:51.283 --> 28:52.983
Your end has come.

28:53.217 --> 28:55.950
You will get your deserts
within a short time.

28:56.917 --> 28:59.283
What are you gabbing again, Selcan Hatun?

28:59.817 --> 29:03.117
Do not rush. You will see sooner or later.

29:28.217 --> 29:29.283
Aunt.

29:37.050 --> 29:38.383
What did I do, aunt?

29:39.817 --> 29:41.983
The people that split my father's bread

29:42.717 --> 29:47.650
the people that we believe and
treat with great respect killed us.

29:50.150 --> 29:53.183
How my eyes and heart sealed that much?

29:54.317 --> 29:55.650
What did I do?

29:59.083 --> 30:04.650
I do not have power to be mentioned
as Bey or even as humankind.

30:05.617 --> 30:08.183
You cannot get anywhere by behaving
like that, Tugtekin Bey.

30:08.417 --> 30:10.050
Come to yourself.

30:13.883 --> 30:19.017
Carelessness sealed both
our hearts and our eyes, son.

30:20.950 --> 30:23.717
Do not forget that I hosted them
in my table.

30:25.250 --> 30:29.350
They stole the trust that
our Sultan gave to Sungurtekin.

30:30.250 --> 30:32.717
I could not burst out my anger
to their faces.

30:34.117 --> 30:39.283
I let my son Gundogdu to marry with
that centipede Goncagul.

30:41.817 --> 30:45.050
If Ertugrul did not break
the seal of our hearts

30:46.050 --> 30:48.650
we would be more miserable.

30:50.717 --> 30:53.150
You fought with lots of enemies,
Tugtekin Bey.

30:53.283 --> 30:56.683
You are always in the front
for your nomad group.

30:57.750 --> 31:00.083
Everybody knows how you fought
with Mongols.

31:00.850 --> 31:02.983
And how you risked your life.

31:07.417 --> 31:09.883
Those beautiful days are so far now.

31:14.950 --> 31:20.617
We all know that you have
a brave decisive heart.

31:21.783 --> 31:24.383
Those days are here, son.

31:26.117 --> 31:29.083
We will endure only one more day.

31:31.617 --> 31:36.250
You saw the light within the utter
darkness with lots of pain.

31:37.917 --> 31:39.683
Last ditch effort.

31:39.883 --> 31:43.350
Tugtekin Bey, last ditch effort.

31:45.883 --> 31:51.083
Now it is time to get out from this utter
darkness and arrange the justice train.

31:55.916 --> 31:57.817
-Selcan!
-Mother!

32:00.183 --> 32:02.883
How are you? Are you fine?

32:03.083 --> 32:06.217
I am fine mother.
I know you were worried about me.

32:06.317 --> 32:08.050
But fortunately, I am okay.

32:10.950 --> 32:13.983
I stamped the mark of Kayi tribe
on Aytolun's arm.

32:14.217 --> 32:17.850
If Tugtekin Bey did not have a claim
I would kill her.

32:18.050 --> 32:19.783
I cannot remunerate you, Selcan Hatun.

32:21.017 --> 32:22.150
Forgive me.

32:26.750 --> 32:29.317
I will take care of Selcan, mother.
Do not worry.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.683
Come, have a seat.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.883
Aunt! Aunt!

33:11.117 --> 33:12.650
What happened to you?

33:14.317 --> 33:18.150
I could not capture the evidence.
Both of them managed to escape.

33:18.983 --> 33:22.217
Banu Cicek will give the evidence
to Ertugrul.

33:22.383 --> 33:24.150
We must avoid this.

33:26.150 --> 33:27.950
Goncagul come to yourself!

33:28.350 --> 33:30.717
Selcan will die, there's no other way.

33:30.917 --> 33:32.717
The main point is Ertugrul.

33:33.183 --> 33:36.083
Gumustekin Bey must kill him.

33:36.617 --> 33:40.783
Aunt, is it easy? How will it be?

33:41.417 --> 33:45.083
Do not forget that you are
the daughter of a mangrave, Goncagul.

33:45.150 --> 33:49.917
Ertugrul or another person cannot
escape from the anger of Gumustekin Bey.

33:51.383 --> 33:53.783
Now we must inform your father.

34:12.883 --> 34:14.917
<i>Alps are like wild horses.</i>

34:14.983 --> 34:18.150
<i>If a Bey does not hold</i>
 <i>his horse's halter tight</i>

34:18.217 --> 34:23.250
<i>whether his horse is strong and speedy,</i>
 <i>it is destination will be unbeknown.</i>

34:24.117 --> 34:28.183
<i>You must hold both Alps'</i>
 <i>and Kayi people's halter tight.</i>

34:56.783 --> 35:00.783
Did you see what the abscess
did to Bey in one day?

35:00.883 --> 35:03.717
He will be miserable when
he learns the truth, Selcan.

35:04.417 --> 35:06.917
He did not believe you and Ertugrul Bey.

35:09.383 --> 35:11.083
He will learn everything now.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.117
How is your arm, son?

35:19.217 --> 35:20.883
It hurts a little, mother.

35:20.983 --> 35:23.183
I got tired when riding the horse.
But I am fine.

35:23.250 --> 35:25.083
Let us send word to Artuk Bey, brother.

35:25.150 --> 35:27.417
No brother, thank you. I am fine.

35:28.217 --> 35:32.017
Ameer Sadettin Kobek presented
his compliments to all of you.

35:33.117 --> 35:37.017
Gumustekin Bey is just around the corner.
He is coming here soon.

35:44.117 --> 35:46.017
He may come right in.

35:49.283 --> 35:53.350
As you know, we have to meet
the margrave properly.

36:02.683 --> 36:06.350
Have a seat, son.
We have things to tell you.

36:46.783 --> 36:48.250
Look, Goncagul.

36:48.950 --> 36:53.217
Your father and I trusted you
at the beginning.

36:55.150 --> 36:58.250
You must maintain your composure.

37:00.717 --> 37:02.183
Do not forget.

37:02.383 --> 37:05.617
We survived lots of hardships until today.

37:06.217 --> 37:08.283
We will overcome this as well.

37:10.283 --> 37:12.650
We will aunt, we will.

37:13.950 --> 37:18.917
They will all hang on to the sole of
our boots like bugs

37:19.283 --> 37:23.083
and they will mix up with
the soil of the road we walk.

37:23.883 --> 37:26.050
They will be pale in comparison.

37:28.217 --> 37:29.917
Do you understand me?

37:32.317 --> 37:36.183
Do not disregard your father.

37:37.250 --> 37:40.917
I know aunt, do not worry.

37:52.950 --> 37:54.417
I hope nothing is wrong.

37:58.783 --> 38:02.217
You seem like our nomad group
fell into hands of Mongols.

38:02.650 --> 38:04.150
I wish it did, brother.

38:07.250 --> 38:08.983
What are you saying nephew?

38:12.683 --> 38:15.417
I know the murderer of
my mother and father.

38:18.717 --> 38:22.083
Now it is time for you to wake you up
from carelessness.

38:24.983 --> 38:26.383
What are you saying?

38:27.717 --> 38:28.917
Ertugrul?

38:29.317 --> 38:32.250
What is happening brother?
What did you do again?

38:34.150 --> 38:36.417
I threw together Banu Cicek
and Selcan Hatun

38:36.717 --> 38:38.350
near the nomad tent, brother.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.117
-What are you saying?
-Gundogdu.

38:42.217 --> 38:43.683
Listen to him.

38:43.917 --> 38:46.283
What should I listen, mother?
Do not you hear him?

38:46.383 --> 38:49.250
He says that he threw together
the murderer of my uncle and my wife.

38:49.317 --> 38:50.883
Aytolun was there, too.

38:52.050 --> 38:53.683
Two brave women...

38:54.317 --> 38:57.650
...Banu Cicek and Selcan Hatun
put their lives on the line...

38:59.717 --> 39:01.983
...and showed me the truth,
Gundogdu Brother.

39:02.683 --> 39:04.050
What is that truth?

39:05.183 --> 39:07.917
Aytolun, who was deceived
by Ertugrul Bey, was there.

39:08.017 --> 39:09.783
Her only aim was to kill them.

39:12.817 --> 39:15.217
I heard that she killed
my mother and father.

39:19.617 --> 39:21.050
That is all brother.

39:22.417 --> 39:26.750
Banu Cicek and Selcan Hatun
took us to Aytolun

39:27.783 --> 39:30.383
and Aytolun will take us to Gumustekin.

39:36.783 --> 39:40.950
Tomorrow, it will be Gumustekin's turn
if God permits, brother.

39:43.017 --> 39:46.717
I know you feel miserable, son. But...

39:49.383 --> 39:51.317
...Goncagul is in this, too.

40:01.650 --> 40:04.383
The light of moon brightens
the mountains before it rises.

40:04.983 --> 40:07.883
We will not return to
this ominous darkness.

40:10.017 --> 40:11.983
I did not believe you, brother...

40:13.850 --> 40:15.850
....and I did not believe my wife.

40:16.750 --> 40:20.250
I tried to take that sinister woman
to my bed.

40:23.383 --> 40:28.417
We do not have time and power to think
and be grieved about these things.

40:29.950 --> 40:33.917
It is time to take care
of this matter, son.

40:35.183 --> 40:36.850
What should I do Ertugrul?

40:39.383 --> 40:41.417
You cannot do anything
with your condition.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.317
Let Tugtekin and I solve this.

40:48.417 --> 40:53.017
So they deceived both Tugtekin Bey
and I, is that so?

40:54.383 --> 40:57.650
They wanted me to be Bey just for this.

41:02.117 --> 41:04.250
They entrapped both of us, brother.

41:08.217 --> 41:09.983
We will not surrender, brother.

41:10.350 --> 41:13.417
We will play a game just as they did.

41:13.983 --> 41:16.383
So that our margrave will come
to our nomad tent...

41:17.650 --> 41:20.117
...we will meet him properly.

41:30.117 --> 41:31.383
Brother!

41:31.850 --> 41:33.283
Son! Son!

41:33.350 --> 41:35.617
-Brother.
-Inform Artuk Bey.

41:39.717 --> 41:43.883
In the marriage of our master the prophet
and Almighty Mother Hatice

41:44.350 --> 41:48.050
we can find the secrets of love

41:48.117 --> 41:52.383
respect, fidelity and a happy family.

41:53.750 --> 41:57.983
After the death of Mother Hatice
our master the prophet

41:58.417 --> 42:01.750
memorialized her with love and respect

42:01.817 --> 42:05.017
and he was always loyal to her.

42:06.817 --> 42:11.383
The love between our master
and Hatice never decreased

42:11.717 --> 42:14.417
and it increasingly went on for 25 years.

42:16.683 --> 42:22.150
Our mother, Hatice was the biggest
supporter and friend of our master.

42:23.250 --> 42:26.717
Our master told it to
Mother Hatice firstly

42:26.883 --> 42:29.617
when he had the divine inspiration.

42:30.650 --> 42:35.683
In those days, our blessed mother
supported him mostly.

42:36.983 --> 42:41.250
When our master cloistered
in Hira mountain

42:41.917 --> 42:46.883
Mother Hatice took his meal

42:46.950 --> 42:49.750
regardless of her workers.

42:51.250 --> 42:55.183
Our master was feeling that
his blessed wife would come

42:55.617 --> 42:58.783
and he went to the foothills
of the mountain to meet her.

42:58.950 --> 43:04.217
Because he knew that it was hard
to climb the Hira mountain

43:04.883 --> 43:06.983
and he spared his precious wife.

43:08.683 --> 43:11.750
One day, Mother Hatice

43:11.817 --> 43:16.017
was waiting for our master
at the roof of their home.

43:17.183 --> 43:22.050
Her relatives told her,
"Why are you doing this Hatice?

43:22.150 --> 43:25.850
It is so hot, your old body
will get tired."

43:27.183 --> 43:29.917
And our blessed mother told them

43:29.983 --> 43:35.283
"When my master is under the sun,
I cannot wait in shade."

43:37.917 --> 43:41.217
She showed her loyalty, respect

43:41.283 --> 43:45.383
and the meaning of love by living.

43:47.850 --> 43:54.817
When his biggest supporter friend
and wife Mother Hatice died

43:55.150 --> 44:01.117
our master grieved so much and
they called that year the gloom year.

44:02.817 --> 44:06.150
After the death of our blessed mother

44:06.317 --> 44:10.350
our master memorialized her
with love and goodness.

44:11.650 --> 44:15.117
Whenever someone talked about her
his eyes filled with tears.

44:17.150 --> 44:22.350
Our master showed his fidelity and
dependence to Mother Hatice

44:23.050 --> 44:26.650
in the conquest of Mecca one more time.

44:28.250 --> 44:34.883
The Muslims that were expelled
from their country conquested Mecca.

44:36.950 --> 44:41.917
Our master conquested Mecca
with ten thousand soldiers

44:42.217 --> 44:46.950
and visited the grave of our mother
and cried for her.

44:48.750 --> 44:55.283
When our master's companion asked him
where to set up his tent, he answered

44:56.950 --> 45:02.683
"Set it up in front of Hatice's grave
I will watch her."

45:03.083 --> 45:06.650
and he proved his loyalty.

45:12.117 --> 45:16.150
Love is a gift for humankind from God.

45:17.650 --> 45:22.150
Love, respect and fidelity
hold the partners together.

45:23.383 --> 45:26.050
Fidelity is not forgetting.

45:27.083 --> 45:30.417
Fidelity is loving in a good day
or in a bad day

45:30.750 --> 45:33.883
no matter how great your trouble is.

45:54.750 --> 45:55.917
Slowly, Bey.

46:00.950 --> 46:02.283
Gundogdu Bey!

46:03.183 --> 46:06.383
You have a fever, Bey.
You must rest completely.

46:08.117 --> 46:09.883
Do not worry, Artuk Bey.

46:09.983 --> 46:12.117
I will not leave him alone for a moment.

46:24.317 --> 46:25.417
Artuk Bey.

46:32.017 --> 46:36.883
As I understand, my brother's arm
is worse than we think.

46:42.083 --> 46:44.983
What makes you anxious that much,
Artuk Bey?

46:45.783 --> 46:47.650
Say it for God's sake.

46:52.950 --> 46:54.183
Artuk Bey.

46:55.983 --> 47:00.217
They are my family,
I have nothing to hide.

47:05.617 --> 47:09.983
-This abscess is a big trouble, Bey.
-What trouble, Artuk Bey?

47:11.617 --> 47:17.017
I have never seen an abscess that reached
to the bone in a night, Hayme Hatun.

47:19.950 --> 47:22.950
If we cannot dry it, I am afraid
of the things that can happen.

47:25.983 --> 47:27.617
Tell me, Artuk Bey.

47:27.950 --> 47:29.750
I know this abscess well.

47:30.117 --> 47:34.717
It was at the back of Suleyman Shah.
Tell us and let us take measures.

47:38.217 --> 47:41.117
If we cannot dry the wound
it will mix with his blood.

47:42.050 --> 47:47.250
And it may kill him, God forbid.

47:51.283 --> 47:53.983
Is there another remedy for this illness?

47:55.317 --> 47:58.117
I hope we will dry the wound Selcan Hatun.

47:58.417 --> 48:00.383
-I hope so.
-I hope so.

48:03.050 --> 48:07.650
But I might have to cut his arm

48:08.950 --> 48:10.783
to prevent it from mixing with blood.

48:22.650 --> 48:23.817
Gundogdu Bey.

48:24.750 --> 48:27.150
Never hinder the medicines I gave.

48:27.283 --> 48:29.017
I will come and control your arm
frequently.

48:29.850 --> 48:30.917
Thank you.

48:33.850 --> 48:35.983
The rest is the volition of God.

48:37.350 --> 48:38.617
Excuse me.

48:39.683 --> 48:40.950
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

48:55.150 --> 48:56.217
Selcan.

48:57.650 --> 48:59.183
Take care of my son.

48:59.750 --> 49:01.250
Do not worry, mother.

49:25.150 --> 49:26.750
Oh Selcan!

49:28.783 --> 49:30.717
After all the things I did...

49:31.817 --> 49:35.150
...I cannot dare to look at you.

49:36.983 --> 49:39.183
Wait. Listen to me.

49:42.283 --> 49:44.383
I know you will forgive me.

49:45.650 --> 49:47.283
You have always forgiven me.

49:49.350 --> 49:54.350
But I do not know how I can forgive
myself this time Selcan.

49:56.417 --> 50:02.017
After all the things I told you.
I cannot forget the things I told you.

50:05.350 --> 50:07.683
They deceived you, Bey.

50:08.417 --> 50:12.783
But I never gave up loving you
for one day.

50:14.117 --> 50:16.950
I know, you always loved me.

50:22.650 --> 50:25.017
You turned my world into heaven.

50:28.617 --> 50:30.950
Everything will be the same, will it not?

50:32.117 --> 50:33.850
If God permits, Bey.

50:39.050 --> 50:42.717
I feel a little cold. Tuck me in.

51:12.217 --> 51:17.750
God bless, Gumustekin Bey!

51:25.150 --> 51:29.717
God bless, Gumustekin Bey!

52:21.950 --> 52:24.417
That corrupt man's day-old
sultanate started.

52:27.217 --> 52:29.317
Do not forget, you will kiss his hand.

52:29.783 --> 52:31.217
What are you saying, Ertugrul?

52:31.383 --> 52:34.217
You must have great respect
for margrave without fail, brother.

53:18.917 --> 53:20.650
Welcome, Gumustekin Bey.

53:22.417 --> 53:24.117
Thank you, Hayme Hatun.

53:25.917 --> 53:27.117
Tugtekin Bey.

53:33.650 --> 53:36.083
It is a good welcome
befitting to our state.

53:37.183 --> 53:39.017
Welcome, Gumustekin Bey.

53:40.317 --> 53:41.317
Thank you.

53:55.050 --> 53:59.817
God bless, Gumustekin Bey!

55:54.383 --> 55:56.217
If you accept...

55:57.783 --> 56:02.650
...I want to give you gold coins.

56:08.017 --> 56:11.717
Of course, it would not recoup the things

56:11.883 --> 56:14.217
you did for our state
for such a long time.

56:14.850 --> 56:19.783
But you can consider it
as a little gift of our state.

57:26.017 --> 57:29.217
Good luck with your margrave duty,
Gumustekin Bey.

57:31.283 --> 57:33.083
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey.

58:05.017 --> 58:09.150
May your margrave duty be blessed,
Gumustekin Bey.

58:11.350 --> 58:13.117
Thank you, Hayme Hatun.

58:14.983 --> 58:20.783
Tonight, I want to host you
in my tent with Tugtekin Bey.

58:24.050 --> 58:25.917
Your wish is my command, Hayme Hatun.

58:27.217 --> 58:29.283
I will accept your invitation.

58:29.850 --> 58:31.050
Thank you.

58:56.617 --> 58:57.917
Peace be upon you.

58:58.083 --> 59:00.783
And peace be upon you.

59:04.650 --> 59:05.917
Gumustekin Bey.

59:12.350 --> 59:14.350
May your margrave duty be blessed.

59:15.883 --> 59:19.017
Thank you, Gundogdu Bey. Thank you.

59:27.050 --> 59:28.950
Share it with your Alps.

59:29.817 --> 59:30.817
Thank you.

59:32.250 --> 59:33.750
Come, have a seat.

59:49.850 --> 59:51.150
Congratulations, Bey.

59:51.750 --> 59:53.417
Thank you, Sungurtekin Bey.

59:55.350 --> 59:59.383
You proved your loyalty
to our state one more time.

01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.383
Thank you.

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:07.383
Take it.

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:17.417
I will share them with
the children of martyrs.

01:00:43.117 --> 01:00:45.817
We saw the kind face of our state.

01:00:46.883 --> 01:00:49.017
Now we will see its justice.

01:00:50.683 --> 01:00:54.217
Everyone will get their share
from its justice, Gumustekin Bey.

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:24.117
Whenever Ertugrul Bey talks about
justice he disturbs the peace.

01:01:40.117 --> 01:01:42.683
May your margrave duty be blessed,
Gumustekin Bey.

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:45.917
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:02.983
I will be happy to share those golds
with the ones in need.

01:02:20.317 --> 01:02:22.717
May your margrave duty be blessed, Bey.

01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:39.350
May your margrave duty be blessed,
Gumustekin Bey.

01:02:53.017 --> 01:02:55.350
May your margrave duty be blessed,
Gumustekin Bey.

01:03:13.983 --> 01:03:14.983
Wait here!

01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:17.250
There is a strict order,
no one can approach him.

01:03:17.317 --> 01:03:20.417
Brother, we will give some water
and we will go.

01:03:20.683 --> 01:03:22.250
Look, he is devastated.

01:03:22.317 --> 01:03:24.183
No Bamsi, do not even bother.

01:03:36.117 --> 01:03:37.750
What are they doing here?

01:03:41.683 --> 01:03:43.050
Gumustekin Bey.

01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:47.750
If you permit, we want to give
some water to Dogan.

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:49.983
How dare you?

01:03:50.283 --> 01:03:53.350
Do you ask for permission
to give water to the convict?

01:03:56.183 --> 01:03:58.950
-Remove them from here immediately.
-As you please, Bey.

01:04:01.317 --> 01:04:04.317
Wait brother. Wait.

01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:07.783
We are reasonable, brother.

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:13.183
Take this brother,
he must be very thirsty.

01:04:13.417 --> 01:04:15.883
Thank you, brother.

01:05:18.099 --> 01:05:19.533
What happened to your arm Aytolun?

01:05:20.033 --> 01:05:22.466
I got wounded when I was fighting
with Selcan, brother.

01:05:22.566 --> 01:05:23.933
What are you saying?

01:05:24.533 --> 01:05:26.033
Banu Cicek.

01:05:26.666 --> 01:05:29.066
She met with Selcan in Karakayalar.

01:05:33.333 --> 01:05:36.499
How dare? How did you
let this happen, Aytolun?

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:38.933
-I was forced to.
-What does it mean?

01:05:39.099 --> 01:05:41.033
Why did not you tell Alps? Why?

01:05:42.066 --> 01:05:45.366
Banu Cicek was going to give
an evidence to Selcan

01:05:45.466 --> 01:05:48.066
that will prove that we committed
the murders, father.

01:05:50.566 --> 01:05:54.299
What are you saying, Goncagul?
What evidence?

01:05:54.499 --> 01:05:55.733
We do not know.

01:05:57.999 --> 01:06:00.266
I went there to kill both of them.

01:06:00.599 --> 01:06:02.533
I could not say anything
to anyone, brother.

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:05.733
I was afraid that the evidence
would change hands.

01:06:06.099 --> 01:06:08.666
It would be our end father. Our end.

01:06:12.233 --> 01:06:14.333
And Banu Cicek? Where is she?

01:06:15.999 --> 01:06:18.433
She escaped to give the evidence
to Ertugrul.

01:06:21.299 --> 01:06:26.199
If Ertugrul lives, this would be
a disaster for all of us.

01:06:38.499 --> 01:06:40.466
That corrupt man attained his desire.

01:06:40.633 --> 01:06:42.966
We will collapse his sultanate around him.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:47.332
He proved us that he won't be
a mangrave but a tyrant.

01:06:48.666 --> 01:06:52.266
He is trying to buy his sins with
the gold coins he gives away.

01:06:52.533 --> 01:06:56.666
The Beys that plead will pay
a heavy price for those golds.

01:06:57.599 --> 01:07:00.099
But we will punish him first.

01:07:01.166 --> 01:07:03.066
It is time to get even with him,
Mother Hayme.

01:07:04.599 --> 01:07:07.599
From now on, things
will not be easy, son.

01:07:08.299 --> 01:07:10.166
He will not stop until he kills you.

01:07:10.533 --> 01:07:13.399
I have already given him an opportunity
to kill me, Mother.

01:07:14.733 --> 01:07:18.433
He knows that I will go and get
the evidence from Banu Cicek.

01:07:19.033 --> 01:07:20.699
He will come after me with his soldiers.

01:07:20.966 --> 01:07:24.699
When he finds us together,
he will find the opportunity.

01:07:25.499 --> 01:07:29.266
And all I have to do is
to give him that opportunity.

01:07:29.466 --> 01:07:32.233
How will you cope with the soldiers, son?

01:07:32.733 --> 01:07:35.666
And those soldiers will
carry out their missions.

01:07:36.066 --> 01:07:39.299
If any one of them gets hurt,
it will be on us.

01:07:40.499 --> 01:07:42.199
What if they kill you?

01:07:45.033 --> 01:07:46.466
Do not worry, Mother Hayme.

01:07:46.566 --> 01:07:48.599
We will keep sight of him all the time.

01:07:49.966 --> 01:07:52.133
Nothing will happen
to our soldiers, mother.

01:07:53.199 --> 01:07:56.566
If I can not get hold of Gumustekin,
everything will be over.

01:07:58.066 --> 01:07:59.733
But, what scares me is not this.

01:08:01.233 --> 01:08:02.333
What is it, son?

01:08:03.433 --> 01:08:06.666
God knows what Gumustekin will
do before he starts following me.

01:08:07.299 --> 01:08:08.999
This is going to be a long night.

01:08:09.666 --> 01:08:11.433
They will not idle away the hours
doing nothing tonight.

01:08:12.066 --> 01:08:13.566
I will not come to dinner tonight.

01:08:14.099 --> 01:08:16.299
All of you will be my eyes and ears.

01:08:17.333 --> 01:08:18.966
All the words he said,

01:08:19.433 --> 01:08:22.066
all the things he did will be
a big threat for us.

01:08:22.666 --> 01:08:24.666
Open your eyes and ears.

01:08:30.533 --> 01:08:33.266
It is difficult for me to let you
go alone, brother.

01:08:35.366 --> 01:08:37.433
I am sure you will be with me
with your prayers.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:40.466
-You should rest, brother.
-Thank you.

01:09:55.266 --> 01:09:56.366
Gundogdu Bey.

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:08.233
I worry about your arm, Bey.
I wanted to see you.

01:10:09.466 --> 01:10:11.233
I am fine, it is not important.

01:10:13.499 --> 01:10:16.366
If you need anything,
do not hesitate to ask for it.

01:10:16.533 --> 01:10:19.199
You know, I am always with you.

01:10:20.033 --> 01:10:23.133
Just as you are always with
my father's mangrave.

01:10:23.966 --> 01:10:26.099
I wanted to express my gratitude
to you again.

01:10:27.466 --> 01:10:32.133
I only want what is good
for our state, Goncagul Hatun.

01:10:32.999 --> 01:10:35.299
You can not understand how happy I am.

01:10:35.666 --> 01:10:39.633
The ones play off against us will not
prevent our marriage.

01:10:40.499 --> 01:10:44.133
If God permits, our tent will be merry
with our marriage, Bey.

01:10:44.566 --> 01:10:45.666
If God permits.

01:10:46.166 --> 01:10:49.199
Our tent and our nomad group
will be merry very soon.

01:10:51.133 --> 01:10:54.366
But you do not look good, Bey.

01:10:55.133 --> 01:10:58.533
I do not know if it is because your arm.

01:10:59.033 --> 01:11:01.399
I am thinking about the murderer
of my uncle, Goncagul Hatun.

01:11:01.666 --> 01:11:05.066
I will not be eased until
they get their deserts.

01:11:05.732 --> 01:11:08.732
They will, Bey. They will.

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:10.999
If God permits.

01:11:12.533 --> 01:11:18.233
I will not be eased untill
I see them dying in pain.

01:11:19.399 --> 01:11:21.133
All I want is this.

01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:28.233
-Excuse me, Bey.
-Of course.

01:11:51.066 --> 01:11:54.433
-Did you hear the words of that snake?
-Yes I did, Bey.

01:11:55.933 --> 01:11:59.599
Oh God, she is telling lies in my face.

01:12:01.199 --> 01:12:03.166
How did I believe that woman?

01:12:04.233 --> 01:12:05.533
Selcan.

01:12:06.366 --> 01:12:09.033
After all the things I did to you,

01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:12.933
after all the things I told you,
how could you forgive me?

01:12:13.433 --> 01:12:15.733
You are innocent, Bey.

01:12:16.633 --> 01:12:20.233
You forgave an evil woman like me, right?

01:12:24.299 --> 01:12:28.399
If you had not made room for my sins

01:12:29.666 --> 01:12:33.066
in your big heart,
I would not be there today.

01:12:33.699 --> 01:12:35.099
Selcan.

01:12:36.266 --> 01:12:41.633
From now on, I want you by my side
until the last day of my life.

01:12:43.066 --> 01:12:45.166
I do not want anything else from God.

01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:56.633
Thank God.

01:13:23.599 --> 01:13:28.733
I am so happy to see those
two nomad groups in unity.

01:13:29.299 --> 01:13:31.433
From now on, Kayi tribe and Dodurga tribe

01:13:31.533 --> 01:13:34.033
will collaborate and we will be stronger.

01:13:38.099 --> 01:13:39.733
You are right, Gumustekin Bey.

01:13:40.699 --> 01:13:46.266
Your mangrave strengthened us
in Turkmen Seigniories.

01:13:47.199 --> 01:13:52.266
If God permits, this Seigniory will always
remain within your mangrave.

01:13:54.166 --> 01:13:57.433
May God protect our unity and solidarity.

01:13:58.099 --> 01:13:59.366
Amen.

01:13:59.999 --> 01:14:01.366
Amen.

01:14:17.999 --> 01:14:20.066
What happened to your arm Aytolun?

01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:31.033
It is not important,
just a little scratch.

01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:33.999
What a pity!

01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:37.099
I am so sorry, get well soon.

01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:40.366
Thank you, Hayme Hatun.

01:14:50.199 --> 01:14:52.999
As soon as the murderers of
Korkut Bey answer to me,

01:14:53.166 --> 01:14:56.666
I will visit other neighboring
Turkmen nomad groups.

01:14:57.299 --> 01:15:01.999
They provided enough support
for my mangrave

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:04.299
and they filled us with pride.

01:15:05.299 --> 01:15:10.133
And then I want to see the marriage of
Gundogdu Bey and my daughter.

01:15:16.533 --> 01:15:22.233
Let justice be done upon them
and then we can solemnize.

01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:24.633
Thank you, Gundogdu Bey.

01:15:31.299 --> 01:15:33.333
You talked about justice, Gumustekin Bey.

01:15:33.566 --> 01:15:36.099
Justice will be done upon them of course.

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.633
We all know this.

01:15:38.099 --> 01:15:41.233
The murders of my brother
will answer to us.

01:15:41.999 --> 01:15:46.933
But when you said justice,
you seemed like thinking about something.

01:15:49.199 --> 01:15:53.633
It is true. I will get my hands
on this matter as the mangrave.

01:15:58.533 --> 01:16:00.699
You made a good decision, Bey.

01:16:01.133 --> 01:16:06.033
It is time to solve this problem
and be in peace within nomad groups.

01:16:07.099 --> 01:16:09.066
Your justice will impower us...

01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:11.433
...Gumustekin Bey.

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:14.233
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey. Thank you.

01:16:14.499 --> 01:16:16.933
As the mangrave, first I will start with

01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:22.433
taking Dogan Alp and learning
the place of Banu Cicek.

01:16:23.099 --> 01:16:26.233
And then she will be executed erewhile.

01:16:29.299 --> 01:16:32.666
Tomorrow morning, my soldiers
will take Dogan Alp.

01:16:32.966 --> 01:16:34.599
And they will cut his body

01:16:34.733 --> 01:16:40.166
until the sharp sword of justice
will loose his sealed tongue.

01:16:46.233 --> 01:16:48.733
Quick justice is the best.

01:16:49.299 --> 01:16:54.466
I will not let this sedition
to disturb our nomad group.

01:16:55.199 --> 01:16:59.133
From now on, it is my duty
to find the killer of Korkut Bey

01:16:59.299 --> 01:17:01.066
and take his revenge.

01:17:03.133 --> 01:17:04.699
God bless our mangrave.

01:17:05.966 --> 01:17:09.066
We do not want to be disturbed with
the obstinacy of Ertugrul Bey.

01:17:09.999 --> 01:17:13.499
You saved us from another disaster,
Gumustekin Bey.

01:17:15.433 --> 01:17:16.999
Well done, nephew.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:20.133
As a child who grew in this lands,

01:17:20.233 --> 01:17:23.666
I knew that you would make a good Bey
from the beginning.

01:17:24.166 --> 01:17:25.366
Thank you.

01:17:27.666 --> 01:17:30.133
The joy of oncoming Nawruz

01:17:30.199 --> 01:17:33.066
and the wedding of my daughter
will coincide, if God permits.

01:17:35.999 --> 01:17:37.399
Am I right, daughter?

01:17:38.599 --> 01:17:41.533
If God permits, Gumustekin Bey.
If God permits.

01:17:43.999 --> 01:17:47.699
It is the best time to remove
the rust and dirt of the past

01:17:47.999 --> 01:17:51.099
and make a fresh start like a spray.

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:53.466
May God give you a long life, Bey.

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:35.166
Our people are exhausted, Bey.

01:18:37.399 --> 01:18:43.199
They do not have enough stregth left
to move, let alone go to Kefere border.

01:18:45.033 --> 01:18:46.666
And there are Alps, Bey.

01:18:46.933 --> 01:18:51.233
All the Alps say,
"Sword is good with it's scabbard."

01:18:51.666 --> 01:18:55.333
In conclusion, everybody
wants peace in his crew.

01:19:01.666 --> 01:19:03.666
They want peace when
Bey throttle each other,

01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:08.599
when those corrupt people
try to take hold of our state.

01:19:10.333 --> 01:19:13.199
Right? Is this peace, Turgut?

01:19:14.599 --> 01:19:15.999
No, it is not, Bey.

01:19:17.233 --> 01:19:21.433
It is not, but there is no one
as gallant as you.

01:19:22.633 --> 01:19:26.533
Under this blue sky, each mountain
is no different for them.

01:19:28.099 --> 01:19:31.266
Neither their hearts nor their eyes
know something else.

01:19:32.399 --> 01:19:34.966
Yes, Bey. Your heart is different.

01:19:35.532 --> 01:19:37.966
It is big enough to embrace
the whole world.

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:41.666
If you were not here, we would not
know what to do, Bey.

01:19:42.299 --> 01:19:48.099
Who knows, we may have been out
at grass on different mountains, Bey.

01:19:51.066 --> 01:19:52.933
Bamsi is right, Bey.

01:19:54.266 --> 01:19:58.099
It is time to set your heart on.
If you do,

01:19:58.233 --> 01:20:02.166
the brave men that will follow you to
the Byzantine border can show themselves.

01:20:04.066 --> 01:20:07.233
May your words be light
to the dark hearts, Bey.

01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:10.433
Firstly, we should end this instigation
tomorrow, Turgut.

01:20:11.199 --> 01:20:14.133
Then I will carry this matter
to headquarters.

01:20:14.499 --> 01:20:16.499
We can interpret the condition then.

01:20:17.133 --> 01:20:18.399
Thank you, Bey.

01:20:18.566 --> 01:20:21.599
Just know that we are with you
until we die, Bey.

01:20:42.999 --> 01:20:44.499
I have brought some ayran to you, Bey.

01:20:46.199 --> 01:20:47.633
God bless you, brother!

01:20:47.933 --> 01:20:50.066
But could not you find village bread?

01:20:54.066 --> 01:20:56.099
Oh, you brave man!

01:20:58.333 --> 01:21:01.699
Tell me brother, if Ertugrul Bey says
that we are going to China,

01:21:01.999 --> 01:21:03.366
will you follow him?

01:21:05.099 --> 01:21:07.566
If Ertugrul Bey says that
we are going to the stars,

01:21:07.699 --> 01:21:11.199
I would wing and fly,
don't you know that, Bamsi?

01:21:12.533 --> 01:21:14.966
How magnificent!

01:21:15.999 --> 01:21:17.466
How great!

01:21:18.633 --> 01:21:24.466
With this brave men, we can go everywhere
and we can conquest every country, Bey.

01:21:26.999 --> 01:21:28.333
Make yourself comfortable.

01:21:29.433 --> 01:21:30.933
Thank you, Turgurt.

01:21:32.566 --> 01:21:33.966
Thank you.

01:21:45.566 --> 01:21:46.966
Thank you, Bey.

01:21:56.733 --> 01:22:00.266
Maybe we should finish this tonight

01:22:00.366 --> 01:22:03.633
before Ertugrul meet with
Banu Cicek, brother.

01:22:04.733 --> 01:22:07.333
Of course I can not get in his tent
and kill him.

01:22:08.133 --> 01:22:09.933
Pull yourself together, Aytolun.

01:22:12.233 --> 01:22:18.266
A wounded and abashed man can do this.

01:22:23.299 --> 01:22:24.366
How?

01:22:25.299 --> 01:22:26.566
Tugtekin.

01:22:27.499 --> 01:22:32.133
What would he do
if he learns his wife Gokce

01:22:33.666 --> 01:22:35.533
is in love with another man?

01:22:41.299 --> 01:22:43.166
Am I wrong, Goncagul?

01:22:46.533 --> 01:22:48.266
I will do my best, aunt.

01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:13.333
-Ertugrul.
-Yes, brother?

01:23:14.466 --> 01:23:15.933
You are right, brother.

01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:17.933
What happened, brother?

01:23:18.566 --> 01:23:22.433
Gumustekin will take Dogan Alp
to caravansary tomorrow.

01:23:27.499 --> 01:23:29.433
It is obvious that he will torture him.

01:23:29.733 --> 01:23:31.433
And of course he will kill him.

01:23:33.933 --> 01:23:36.166
He knows that I will not give
Dogan Alp to him.

01:23:38.433 --> 01:23:41.133
He invited me looking into your eyes.

01:23:41.566 --> 01:23:46.199
Is his aim to kill you while you
take him from the soldiers?

01:23:46.566 --> 01:23:51.733
No brother. He wants to prove
that I collaborate with killers.

01:23:53.733 --> 01:23:57.666
He wants me to kill his soldiers
while I take Dogan Alp.

01:23:58.966 --> 01:24:02.133
Thus, he will prove that
I raise against him.

01:24:04.133 --> 01:24:07.299
So, he will have the right on his side
to kill me.

01:24:07.699 --> 01:24:10.733
Neither you nor my mother
will have anything to say.

01:24:13.066 --> 01:24:15.233
What will you do Ertugrul?

01:24:17.333 --> 01:24:20.599
Tomorrow we will take Dogan Alp
from the soldiers without spilling blood.

01:24:23.099 --> 01:24:24.366
And Gumustekin?

01:24:27.133 --> 01:24:31.466
If I am right, he will send Dogan Alp
with soldiers in advance.

01:24:32.533 --> 01:24:34.433
And then he will follow us.

01:24:36.933 --> 01:24:38.733
Let's see who will come under ambush.

01:24:39.933 --> 01:24:42.333
Look at the things we talk, brothers.

01:24:43.499 --> 01:24:46.399
Ever since I could remember,
we have always been in trouble.

01:24:47.366 --> 01:24:52.533
My late father took on with
Alp Tekin for his entire lifetime

01:24:52.733 --> 01:24:54.299
and he wasted his life.

01:24:54.566 --> 01:24:58.266
Then Kurdoglu and now Gumustekin.

01:24:59.999 --> 01:25:01.999
When will this suffering end?

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:07.233
Maybe this is our destiny, brother.

01:25:10.099 --> 01:25:13.033
We are obliged to these things

01:25:13.199 --> 01:25:17.366
until we make our own justice
in our own country, brother.

01:25:18.999 --> 01:25:21.366
These instigators discipline us
like a dervish.

01:25:21.699 --> 01:25:24.566
The truth and the situation is this.

01:25:27.233 --> 01:25:31.699
All we have to do is to fight against
these instigators till the end.

01:25:32.533 --> 01:25:37.533
You are right brother, but
I do not have power any longer.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:41.299
I miss the days that I herd sheep.

01:25:43.266 --> 01:25:48.966
I want to grow old with Selcan Hatun
and die with her.

01:25:51.433 --> 01:25:53.366
I do not want anything else.

01:26:02.999 --> 01:26:05.033
-Brother.
-Gundogdu.

01:26:05.733 --> 01:26:08.166
I am fine. I want to sleep.

01:26:09.533 --> 01:26:10.999
I am okay.

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:13.499
I want to sleep.

01:26:47.166 --> 01:26:49.033
What happened, Goncagul Hatun?

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:53.466
I am sorry Bey, I am...

01:26:57.533 --> 01:26:58.933
Goncagul!

01:27:16.066 --> 01:27:17.299
What happened?

01:27:18.033 --> 01:27:22.666
Goncagul learnt something
that she shouldn't have.

01:27:26.666 --> 01:27:29.033
The thing she heard was too heavy for her.

01:27:35.599 --> 01:27:37.166
What is that?

01:27:40.566 --> 01:27:45.499
She is scared that the dark shadow of
the past will descend upon us.

01:27:46.299 --> 01:27:49.233
That is all. Excuse me, Bey.

01:27:56.666 --> 01:28:00.399
<i>They will be so scared tonight that</i>
 <i>they can do everything.</i>

01:28:00.466 --> 01:28:03.599
You will smile at that sinister woman
and call her mother.

01:28:03.666 --> 01:28:06.599
You will put up with the lies
and slanders of Goncagul.

01:28:06.733 --> 01:28:08.499
You will obey Gumustekin.

01:28:09.433 --> 01:28:11.466
<i>You will grin and bear</i>
 <i>their slanders that...</i>

01:28:11.566 --> 01:28:13.499
<i>...they use to turn us to each other.</i>

01:28:18.233 --> 01:28:19.366
<i>May I come in?</i>

01:28:21.299 --> 01:28:22.599
Come in, Tugtekin Bey.

01:28:43.366 --> 01:28:45.599
I want to know what is happening
in my nomad group.

01:28:48.599 --> 01:28:51.366
Don't you afraid of
the curse of knowing, Bey?

01:28:53.666 --> 01:29:00.133
I would rather be broiled in the truth
than living with lies.

01:29:03.066 --> 01:29:05.299
Bravery is for enemies, Bey.

01:29:06.433 --> 01:29:12.033
Bravery is impossible for the people
that you love more than your life.

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:15.466
Have your say.

01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:21.033
Talking in circles only disquiets
this nomad group, mother.

01:29:25.033 --> 01:29:30.733
Neither my tongue nor my heart
accept to tell these things to you.

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:37.599
Say it. I have more power after
all those pains. Do not worry.

01:29:39.566 --> 01:29:45.266
So, you should know what Goncagul heard.

01:29:45.533 --> 01:29:46.999
What did she hear?

01:29:49.433 --> 01:29:51.633
The one who is in Gokce's heart.

01:29:55.133 --> 01:29:56.733
What are you saying, mother?

01:29:59.699 --> 01:30:01.966
I am afraid of your anger, son.

01:30:02.499 --> 01:30:04.666
I do not want to cause another pain.

01:30:06.066 --> 01:30:09.699
Maybe everything's over and
daughter Gokce forgot him.

01:30:10.099 --> 01:30:12.299
Maybe she wiped the wound in her heart.

01:30:12.566 --> 01:30:14.433
I do not want to malign.

01:30:15.466 --> 01:30:19.466
I reached the end of my ropes, Mother.
Have your say.

01:30:22.033 --> 01:30:23.333
Ertugrul Bey.

01:30:24.499 --> 01:30:29.633
Before he saved Halime Sultan from Kefere

01:30:30.499 --> 01:30:33.999
Gokce was in love with him.

01:30:34.733 --> 01:30:37.433
Do you hear yourself?

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:40.399
I would rather die than
telling you these things.

01:30:41.699 --> 01:30:44.699
I would regard all these things as
childhood adventures but...

01:30:45.033 --> 01:30:46.366
But what?

01:30:50.033 --> 01:30:52.599
But, after he married Halime Sultan,

01:30:52.733 --> 01:30:57.933
Gokce could not quench the fire in her,
but yet she wanted to marry you, son.

01:30:57.999 --> 01:31:03.099
Enough!

01:31:04.399 --> 01:31:06.133
<i>May I come in, Mother?</i>

01:31:08.299 --> 01:31:09.533
Come in, daughter.

01:31:16.066 --> 01:31:18.133
I came here to say goodnight, mother.

01:31:18.266 --> 01:31:19.633
Goodnight, daughter.

01:31:38.133 --> 01:31:39.299
What happened, mother?

01:31:40.733 --> 01:31:43.433
Nothing. Goodnight.

01:31:47.266 --> 01:31:48.599
Goodnight.

01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:11.166
Do you want anything, Bey?

01:32:14.633 --> 01:32:16.366
I am tired. I just want to sleep.

01:32:25.399 --> 01:32:30.433
I know your pain is fresh, but tell me
the thing that you could not tell, Bey.

01:32:38.066 --> 01:32:40.333
Is it right that you were in love
with Ertugrul once?

01:32:49.733 --> 01:32:51.233
Is that right, Gokce?

01:33:03.233 --> 01:33:04.466
It is right, Bey.

01:33:16.399 --> 01:33:17.599
And...

01:33:20.433 --> 01:33:22.133
And Ertugrul?

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:28.099
Etrugrul Bey always
considered me a sister.

01:33:31.033 --> 01:33:34.133
And when I told him
the things in my heart,

01:33:34.199 --> 01:33:37.333
he tried to deter me like a brother.

01:33:42.099 --> 01:33:46.466
When Ertugrul Bey took
Halime Sultan to nomad group,

01:33:46.533 --> 01:33:48.466
I twisted the knife.

01:33:51.966 --> 01:33:53.233
No matter what.

01:33:55.266 --> 01:33:57.333
Halime Sultan became his wife.

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:01.933
I fired my heart with brands.

01:34:06.033 --> 01:34:07.566
But I could not make it.

01:34:11.199 --> 01:34:13.099
I could not give up on this love.

01:34:23.466 --> 01:34:25.399
And then you found me.

01:34:30.166 --> 01:34:33.033
I learnt what being loved means from you.

01:34:36.699 --> 01:34:41.433
I understood that you are the man I love.

01:34:44.033 --> 01:34:46.433
And I will love you
till the end of my life.

01:34:50.433 --> 01:34:52.933
I wanted to tell you tons of times...

01:34:56.366 --> 01:34:57.999
...but I got scared.

01:34:59.266 --> 01:35:02.099
I got scared that you would
fall out of love with me.

01:35:06.366 --> 01:35:08.466
Is there anything else
that you did not mention?

01:36:27.366 --> 01:36:30.999
This is not only about Goncagul
and Aytolun.

01:36:31.399 --> 01:36:33.333
So that Gumustekin is in the loop,

01:36:33.433 --> 01:36:35.399
there must be another person behind him.

01:36:35.633 --> 01:36:37.633
What if things go wrong?

01:36:42.733 --> 01:36:48.433
It is my duty to kill all of them
until the last betrayar, Halime Sultan.

01:36:49.433 --> 01:36:51.132
Do not worry.

01:36:51.466 --> 01:36:53.099
If God permits, Ertugrul.

01:37:02.966 --> 01:37:04.266
Ertugrul.

01:37:14.399 --> 01:37:17.033
By looking these stubborn kicks,
it will be a boy.

01:37:17.499 --> 01:37:20.566
Our son will be the nightmare of Kefere
after his father.

01:37:21.666 --> 01:37:26.366
I wish he will be a good child
and serve his nation.

01:37:27.033 --> 01:37:28.566
If God permits, Ertugrul Bey.

01:37:57.999 --> 01:37:59.199
Hold on, Bey.

01:38:23.633 --> 01:38:25.966
I am with you, Bey.

01:38:26.733 --> 01:38:28.599
I will reduce your fever.

01:38:32.499 --> 01:38:35.166
Look I am here, I am with you.

01:39:04.299 --> 01:39:06.566
Hold on, hold on.

01:39:11.199 --> 01:39:12.433
Bey...

01:39:17.099 --> 01:39:18.433
Let yourself go.

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:36.499
Hold on Gundogdu Bey, Artuk Bey will come.

01:40:05.466 --> 01:40:07.199
We are here to take the convict.

01:40:08.366 --> 01:40:09.399
Untie him.

01:40:13.633 --> 01:40:14.966
What are you doing?

01:40:16.099 --> 01:40:18.099
-Why are you untying me?
-Be quiet! We are leaving.

01:40:21.133 --> 01:40:22.399
Why did you untie me?

01:41:16.033 --> 01:41:17.399
Dogan Alp!

01:41:29.566 --> 01:41:32.499
Do not worry, you will be saved soon.

01:41:45.266 --> 01:41:46.699
Alright! That is enough.

01:41:55.366 --> 01:41:56.399
Turali!

01:42:00.433 --> 01:42:03.433
Come on brothers. May God help us.

01:42:03.733 --> 01:42:05.066
Amen, Bey.

01:42:41.966 --> 01:42:43.066
Mother Hayme.

01:42:44.966 --> 01:42:47.266
-I have something to say.
-Tell me, daughter.

01:42:49.033 --> 01:42:50.299
Tugtekin Bey.

01:42:52.166 --> 01:42:55.333
He learnt that I was in love
with Ertugrul Bey before.

01:42:56.666 --> 01:42:58.133
I know, Mother Hayme.

01:42:59.133 --> 01:43:02.066
Aytolun poisoned Tugtekin Bey's mind.

01:43:13.166 --> 01:43:18.266
So, she wants to turn Tugtekin against
Ertugrul and hide the truth.

01:43:22.133 --> 01:43:24.666
But Ertugrul...

01:43:25.499 --> 01:43:30.666
...uncovered the fact that Aytolun
killed my brother and brother's wife.

01:43:31.733 --> 01:43:33.999
And Tugtekin knows this.

01:43:45.859 --> 01:43:48.526
Mother Hayme,
Gundogdu Bey is ill.

01:43:55.559 --> 01:43:58.393
Tugtekin Bey who boils with
rage over the smallest things...

01:43:59.459 --> 01:44:03.093
...apparently doesn't take
her wife's old flame seriously.

01:44:03.393 --> 01:44:05.893
I don't get it, brother.

01:44:06.293 --> 01:44:10.226
Tugtekin's dagger should have slit
Ertugrul's throat already.

01:44:12.159 --> 01:44:15.059
Tugtekin and Gundogdu
are aware of everything.

01:44:18.826 --> 01:44:20.259
What are you saying, brother?

01:44:21.393 --> 01:44:25.326
Last night when I said I would take
Dogan Alp with me to deliver justice,

01:44:26.026 --> 01:44:29.459
no one said anything.
Not even Tugtekin.

01:44:33.359 --> 01:44:34.793
What shall we do?

01:44:37.926 --> 01:44:39.593
Selcan must die today, Aytolun.

01:44:41.126 --> 01:44:46.493
If Tugtekin found out the truth,
his time has also come.

01:44:49.793 --> 01:44:51.326
<i>Do I have permission,</i>
Gumustekin Bey?

01:44:53.226 --> 01:44:54.826
Come in, Cagri Bey.

01:45:02.126 --> 01:45:04.093
Ertugrul Bey left the nomad tent.

01:45:04.326 --> 01:45:06.259
-Are the soldiers ready?
-They are, Bey.

01:45:06.793 --> 01:45:09.459
Then let's go punish those killers.

01:45:15.593 --> 01:45:19.093
Don't worry brother.
Today, this will all be over.

01:45:22.859 --> 01:45:24.026
Let's go, Cagri Bey.

01:45:28.126 --> 01:45:32.126
Goncagul, keep an eye on Gundogdu.

01:46:45.426 --> 01:46:46.426
Bey!

01:46:49.226 --> 01:46:50.226
Bey!

01:46:50.893 --> 01:46:52.059
Gundogdu Bey!

01:47:37.459 --> 01:47:38.526
We are losing him!

01:49:06.859 --> 01:49:08.259
He is getting away!

01:50:47.259 --> 01:50:48.293
Come here!

01:51:33.859 --> 01:51:34.926
Brother!

01:51:40.393 --> 01:51:42.259
Your captivity is over,
brother Dogan.

01:51:42.959 --> 01:51:44.059
Thank you, Bey.

01:51:47.059 --> 01:51:50.159
You got lucky again, brother.

01:51:53.493 --> 01:51:55.959
Where is Cicek Hatun, Bey?

01:51:56.093 --> 01:51:59.193
Do not worry,
we'll go see her now.

01:52:06.593 --> 01:52:10.359
How long will we turn a blind eye,
Gumustekin Bey?

01:52:10.859 --> 01:52:14.359
We still have time, Cagri Bey.
We'll keep following him.

01:52:15.326 --> 01:52:19.026
He saved a traitor,
but he will never stop.

01:52:20.193 --> 01:52:22.359
He will go and see
the real traitor.

01:52:35.026 --> 01:52:36.559
On your horses!

01:52:38.826 --> 01:52:40.793
Let's finish this. Come on.

01:52:52.059 --> 01:52:54.493
I drew it from the well.
It's ice cold.

01:52:56.226 --> 01:52:58.993
We have to prevent the abscess
from contaminating his blood.

01:52:59.293 --> 01:53:01.026
The only remedy is black knots.

01:53:01.426 --> 01:53:03.526
I can go pick some, Bey!
I know those mushrooms very well.

01:53:03.793 --> 01:53:05.926
I used to pick them
for Suleyman Shah.

01:53:05.993 --> 01:53:08.326
Go pick some,
Selcan Hatun. Hurry!

01:53:10.293 --> 01:53:11.393
Here you are, Bey.

01:53:11.993 --> 01:53:13.159
Oh God!

01:53:18.893 --> 01:53:21.826
God help us.

01:53:22.459 --> 01:53:24.426
Don't take my son
away from me.

01:53:26.859 --> 01:53:28.026
Amen.

01:53:29.593 --> 01:53:32.226
Isak, we need to draw some
blood from Gundogdu Bey.

01:53:32.326 --> 01:53:34.326
Grab some leeches from the
medical tent at once.

01:53:35.159 --> 01:53:36.293
Yes, Bey.

01:54:22.426 --> 01:54:24.993
What is the rush, dervish Isak?

01:54:25.393 --> 01:54:27.359
Did something happen to
Gundogdu Bey?

01:54:27.526 --> 01:54:29.593
He got worse, Goncagul Hatun.

01:54:31.326 --> 01:54:32.859
Where is Selcan Hatun going?

01:54:33.026 --> 01:54:35.293
Artuk Bey sent her to
pick black knots.

01:54:35.426 --> 01:54:36.793
Excuse me.

01:54:46.293 --> 01:54:48.259
Can I look at that one?

01:55:04.059 --> 01:55:05.193
Selcan!

01:55:06.093 --> 01:55:07.359
What happened?
Where are you going?

01:55:08.593 --> 01:55:11.393
Gundogdu Bey's
getting worse, Halime.

01:55:11.926 --> 01:55:14.959
Artuk Bey asked for black knots.
I am going to pick some.

01:55:15.593 --> 01:55:18.259
-I'll come with you.
-Okay, sister.

01:55:54.359 --> 01:55:55.359
Aunt!

01:55:55.926 --> 01:55:57.993
What is wrong, Goncagul?
What is the rush?

01:55:58.226 --> 01:56:01.993
Selcan went by herself to pick black
knots for Gundogdu Bey.

01:56:03.293 --> 01:56:04.826
It is time, aunt.

01:56:05.993 --> 01:56:09.826
It looks like Gundogdu's
troubles will be our remedy.

01:56:11.059 --> 01:56:12.359
Let's go, Goncagul.

01:58:21.826 --> 01:58:23.293
You know what to do.

01:58:31.459 --> 01:58:33.159
We are splitting up here, brother.

01:58:33.226 --> 01:58:37.426
We won't be far away.
But you better be careful, brother.

01:58:40.026 --> 01:58:41.326
Don't you worry.

01:58:46.993 --> 01:58:47.993
Bey.

02:00:27.459 --> 02:00:28.793
Mother Hayme!

02:00:29.459 --> 02:00:32.259
-Goncagul and Aytolun!
-What about them, Gokce?

02:00:33.193 --> 02:00:35.359
They donned their swords
and left the marquee.

02:00:37.459 --> 02:00:40.526
Goncagul Hatun had asked me
where Selcan Hatun was going.

02:00:43.059 --> 02:00:44.159
Selcan!

02:00:45.326 --> 02:00:47.193
One more thing, Mother Hayme.

02:00:47.559 --> 02:00:49.793
Selcan Hatun wasn't alone.

02:00:50.426 --> 02:00:52.293
Halime Sultan was with her.

02:01:37.926 --> 02:01:40.059
Be careful!
They are somewhere around here.

02:01:42.293 --> 02:01:44.293
-Cagri Bey!
-Yes, Gumustekin Bey.

02:01:44.526 --> 02:01:48.826
Let's break up into two
groups and surround them.

02:01:49.459 --> 02:01:53.059
We won't let anyone escape.
If need be, kill them all.

02:01:53.126 --> 02:01:54.526
As you please, Gumustekin Bey.

02:02:07.126 --> 02:02:10.126
-How is your wound, Cicek Hatun?
-Getting better Bey, thanks.

02:02:10.926 --> 02:02:14.593
They will be here in a minute. But can
you fend yourself if they don't show up?

02:02:14.859 --> 02:02:16.226
With God's help, Bey!

02:02:18.559 --> 02:02:19.559
Great.

02:02:43.826 --> 02:02:45.459
We don't want to
spill any blood!

02:02:46.359 --> 02:02:48.026
What do you want then?

02:02:49.059 --> 02:02:51.526
Gumustekin Bey whom you
have been serving...

02:02:53.326 --> 02:02:56.559
-...is a traitor.
-What are you saying?

02:02:57.093 --> 02:03:02.059
As a servant of the state and
Sultan Aleaddin, that's all have to say.

02:03:02.826 --> 02:03:07.093
How dare you call the margrave
of our state a traitor?

02:03:08.026 --> 02:03:10.159
Soldiers, attack!

02:05:32.026 --> 02:05:33.326
Selcan.

02:05:34.859 --> 02:05:36.059
Sister.

02:05:39.993 --> 02:05:42.459
You're worrying yourself
over nothing.

02:05:42.526 --> 02:05:46.426
Almighty God will spare
Gundogdu Bey to us. You'll see.

02:05:48.259 --> 02:05:51.459
And if Gundogdu Bey saw you like this,
he'd be very upset.

02:05:52.993 --> 02:05:54.393
We've overcome many troubles.

02:05:55.059 --> 02:05:57.026
If God permits, this too shall pass.

02:05:58.293 --> 02:06:01.993
Gundogdu Bey needs you, Selcan.
We all do.

02:06:03.193 --> 02:06:05.493
If God permits, Halime.
If God permits.

02:06:07.926 --> 02:06:10.026
Come on, let's find
some black knots.

02:06:10.093 --> 02:06:13.993
Fine. I will check the backside.
Don't worry, we'll find some.

02:06:14.059 --> 02:06:15.159
Okay.

02:06:53.493 --> 02:06:57.259
You won't be getting away
this time, Selcan!

02:07:06.193 --> 02:07:07.326
Selcan!

02:07:36.293 --> 02:07:37.959
Kill them both!

02:08:14.426 --> 02:08:16.226
It 's over, Gumustekin!

02:10:07.026 --> 02:10:09.226
You did everything
just to be appointed margrave.

02:10:10.593 --> 02:10:12.893
To take over the Dodurga tribe...

02:10:14.059 --> 02:10:19.093
...you killed aunt Duru and
replaced her with sister Aytolun.

02:10:20.893 --> 02:10:23.359
You wanted your daughter
to marry Gundogdu Bey

02:10:23.526 --> 02:10:26.093
so that you could take
over the Kayi tribe.

02:10:28.126 --> 02:10:29.993
It was all going
as you planned

02:10:30.593 --> 02:10:34.459
until Selcan Hatun
confronted you.

02:10:50.493 --> 02:10:52.559
I'll kill you all!

02:11:44.026 --> 02:11:48.259
In the end, you killed Korkut Bey
just so you'd be the margrave.

02:12:10.193 --> 02:12:12.393
I wish I could have killed him before.

02:12:16.826 --> 02:12:18.959
No one will believe
what you have to say.

02:13:35.126 --> 02:13:36.459
Halime!

02:14:20.193 --> 02:14:21.193
Halime!

02:14:25.993 --> 02:14:27.359
Selcan!

02:14:29.426 --> 02:14:30.826
Selcan!

02:15:31.126 --> 02:15:32.393
Halime!

02:15:35.959 --> 02:15:37.059
Aytolun!

02:15:39.426 --> 02:15:40.826
Mother Hayme!

02:16:24.859 --> 02:16:26.459
Tugtekin Bey!

02:16:33.826 --> 02:16:36.893
You are going to pay for
what you did to my parents.
