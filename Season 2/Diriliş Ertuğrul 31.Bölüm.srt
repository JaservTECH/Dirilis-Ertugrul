12:06.922 --> 12:11.588
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:12.347 --> 12:16.013
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:16.277 --> 12:19.943
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

12:58.777 --> 13:01.311
It is hereby declare that...

13:02.977 --> 13:04.677
...Dogan and Turgut
Alps will live in nomad tent...

13:06.344 --> 13:09.744
...under the command of Ertugrul Bey
until the winter is over.

13:12.311 --> 13:16.944
Also, Abdurrahman Alp will be jailed in a
cage until we determine...

13:17.211 --> 13:22.644
whether he helped setting an ambush to

13:24.277 --> 13:29.677
Tugtekin and Gundogdu Beys or not.

13:33.311 --> 13:36.877
May the God Almighty save us from
making mistakes.

13:37.644 --> 13:39.211
Amen.

13:40.577 --> 13:41.577
Amen.

13:41.844 --> 13:45.577
May he give us strength to perform
headquarters' judgments.

13:45.944 --> 13:47.511
Amen.

14:36.211 --> 14:38.644
Do you have any words, Ertugrul Bey?

15:04.911 --> 15:06.877
Son of Suleyman Shah, Ertugrul...

15:08.811 --> 15:10.544
...will obey headquarters' judgments.

15:13.811 --> 15:19.677
God may save us from paying
the price of your judgments.

15:24.511 --> 15:25.711
Amen.

15:34.311 --> 15:37.511
Yet I want you to know this...

15:39.444 --> 15:43.844
...a brave man's stare
is sharper than a craven's sword.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.877
When will headquarters end?

16:03.477 --> 16:04.844
Why didn't you attend to headquarters?

16:06.277 --> 16:08.544
We barely returned to nomad tent,
thanks to Ertugrul Bey.

16:08.744 --> 16:09.977
How could I attend to headquarters?

16:14.477 --> 16:15.544
Dogan.

16:16.911 --> 16:20.344
I think judgments of headquarters
will not be good for us, brother.

16:20.877 --> 16:22.744
Heaven forbid, Brother Turgut!

17:17.311 --> 17:18.411
Bey?

17:19.511 --> 17:20.711
Ertugrul Bey?

17:29.377 --> 17:30.611
What happened, Bey?

17:34.311 --> 17:35.811
They hurt us like no other.

17:56.011 --> 17:57.477
Ertugrul Bey?

18:02.477 --> 18:03.577
The headquarters is over.

18:09.544 --> 18:13.777
Apparently, he is like a boy
whose toys were taken away.

18:21.744 --> 18:24.344
You knew headquarters' judgment
would be good.

18:26.677 --> 18:31.211
Apparently, Beys will not let Ertugrul to
get our nomad tent into trouble.

18:38.911 --> 18:41.577
You have a poisonous tongue.

18:42.977 --> 18:45.344
You are shameless beyond words.

18:46.244 --> 18:49.211
I do not know what you are after
or what is your intention but

18:49.777 --> 18:54.511
if you continue doing this,
I will make you pay for it, Aytolun.

18:54.577 --> 18:56.311
-Sister!
-Gokce, stay out of it.

18:57.711 --> 19:00.644
Your words hurt me, Selcan Hatun.

19:01.744 --> 19:04.211
Future of our nomad tents is my concern.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.777
Do you think that I don't know
you are a two-faced snake?

19:13.711 --> 19:17.844
Look, I am silent for the sake of
this beautiful girl.

19:18.977 --> 19:22.244
But do not push my limits.

19:26.644 --> 19:28.277
What are you after?

19:28.911 --> 19:32.677
What am I after?
She wants to poison us.

19:33.277 --> 19:35.777
You, me, Halime.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.977
She wants to plant her flag
in our marquee.

19:41.244 --> 19:44.377
You... You are sick.

19:45.811 --> 19:50.677
You are so sick that
you make everyone sick.

19:52.744 --> 19:56.644
From now on, keep your words to yourself
in this nomad tent.

19:57.344 --> 19:59.977
So that we can have peace.

20:31.506 --> 20:33.173
I heard what happened in the headquarters.

20:33.506 --> 20:34.906
Do not worry.

20:36.006 --> 20:37.740
It is always stormy in winter.

20:41.106 --> 20:42.440
Bey, I...

20:44.440 --> 20:46.040
...made a huge mistake.

20:47.006 --> 20:48.740
What mistake, my gazelle?

20:51.773 --> 20:53.806
I told my mother that
your hand is ruined...

20:55.406 --> 21:00.006
...and you seek vengeance when
you cannot grab sword.

21:02.540 --> 21:05.106
I affected her judgment
in the headquarters.

21:05.540 --> 21:07.140
How can you do that?

21:07.540 --> 21:08.773
How?

21:15.940 --> 21:18.140
I was scared that
I would never see you again.

21:20.040 --> 21:23.373
I was scared that our baby would grow
without his father, Ertugrul.

21:24.006 --> 21:27.906
If you are so scared that I would be a
martyr, you'd better never see me again.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.740
And stop seein me as a man.
-Ertugrul.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.106
<i>You...</i>

22:51.940 --> 22:53.473
You are sick.

22:54.840 --> 22:59.473
You infect everyone
with your corrupted heart.

23:17.340 --> 23:20.873
You were only one who was against
headquarters' judgment, Wild Demir.

23:21.740 --> 23:24.106
My thoughts do not matter, Bey.

23:24.773 --> 23:28.140
What matters was what Ertugrul Bey said.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.506
Ertugrul Bey said he would obey
headquarters' judgment.

23:34.773 --> 23:40.840
You made a huge mistake by taking away
Ertugrul Bey's Alps and his position.

23:41.906 --> 23:45.806
Can you take away the love of Ertugrul
in his Alps' hearts?

23:48.006 --> 23:50.806
The duty of steel is to become sword.

23:52.906 --> 23:55.006
Mares are trained to become horses.

23:56.340 --> 23:58.306
And men are trained to become warriors.

23:59.540 --> 24:03.040
If a man cannot grab a sword,
he cannot be an Alp, Wild Demir.

24:09.173 --> 24:13.140
You wield a sword with your heart,
Tugtekin.

24:14.906 --> 24:17.906
A horse is trained with love.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.840
And an Alp is trained with conscience.

24:23.373 --> 24:26.973
After all these years

24:27.173 --> 24:31.106
you think that wielding a sword
and riding a horse makes you an Alp,

24:31.906 --> 24:35.373
you are mistaken, Tugtekin.
Shame on you.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.073
Wild Demir.

24:39.973 --> 24:43.140
Wild Demir, know your place.

24:45.006 --> 24:47.073
If you take me for a sword
you have forged...

24:48.206 --> 24:50.073
...I will make you pay for it.
-Tugtekin.

24:51.140 --> 24:54.773
If you cannot control your anger,
you will be led astray from your path.

24:58.773 --> 25:00.206
Sit down, Tugtekin.

25:03.206 --> 25:04.340
Sit down.

25:25.806 --> 25:27.806
What is Ertugrul going to do, Gundogdu?

25:34.506 --> 25:38.140
-He is like a crazed stallion now.
-So, we tail him.

25:39.140 --> 25:42.206
We don't want him to cause trouble
for our nomad tent in his state.

25:43.873 --> 25:48.173
That crazed stallion will run with all his
might to find a way out...

25:49.473 --> 25:53.540
...or he will perish on his journey.

25:54.206 --> 25:56.440
Then we should tame the stallion.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.240
Tugtekin.

26:00.473 --> 26:06.073
You are brave but you do not know
the one you are dealing with.

26:07.773 --> 26:11.206
What am I trying to say is,
all rivers fall into the sea.

26:11.473 --> 26:15.840
We have more urgent matters
to handle than Ertugrul.

26:17.506 --> 26:20.406
-What happened, nephew?
-Uncle, winter is coming.

26:20.906 --> 26:22.240
We are running out of food.

26:22.906 --> 26:25.806
We need to get more wheat immediately.

26:28.873 --> 26:30.240
You are right.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.206
We can buy wheat from Armenian villages.

26:34.973 --> 26:36.406
We have not sold our cattle yet.

26:36.940 --> 26:39.473
Women must ready the goods
in the weavery.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.440
We need to get our tribe
out of this state of war.

26:43.039 --> 26:44.940
Our tribesman must get back to
their lives.

26:46.073 --> 26:48.806
People are on the edge.
Let them have some peace.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.173
The mission is yours.
Do what is necessary.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.140
Yes, Bey.

27:33.006 --> 27:34.840
I have good news for Noyan.

28:05.173 --> 28:07.806
<i>Dear mother, my dear mother.</i>

28:09.306 --> 28:11.406
<i>Your son has lost his heart.</i>

28:12.340 --> 28:14.806
<i>I fell in love with a beautiful woman.</i>

28:15.273 --> 28:17.006
<i>I cannot confide my feelings.</i>

28:18.106 --> 28:19.740
<i>I am helpless.</i>

28:21.140 --> 28:23.806
<i>Brave man of the battlefield</i>
 <i>has become a mute now.</i>

28:31.173 --> 28:32.940
I knew I would find you here.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.106
Why did you bother to come here,
Gokce Hatun?

28:37.940 --> 28:39.440
I wanted to talk to you alone.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.040
Do you always visit your mother?

28:46.273 --> 28:48.440
I always come here since the day
we buried her.

28:51.340 --> 28:53.973
At least your mother has a grave to visit.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.340
My parents do not have even a grave.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.006
What happened to your mother, Tugtekin?

29:05.973 --> 29:08.206
She died in my arms while
she was having dinner.

29:11.273 --> 29:14.506
-May her soul rest in peace.
-Amen.

29:16.906 --> 29:18.806
Why are you here, Gokce Hatun?

29:20.073 --> 29:21.240
Well...

29:24.040 --> 29:26.440
Ertugrul Bey's requests
were denied in headquarters.

29:27.773 --> 29:28.940
Yes, they were.

29:30.540 --> 29:33.440
Tugtekin, you must help Ertugrul.

29:35.873 --> 29:37.906
Help him so you can move forward together.

29:38.773 --> 29:41.206
Ertugrul never lets down his people.

29:42.973 --> 29:44.940
He does not but Tugtekin does, right?

29:46.473 --> 29:50.073
I did not mean that. You misunderstood me.

29:51.373 --> 29:53.473
I think they did not do Ertugrul justice.

29:55.306 --> 29:56.940
That is why...
-Enough, Gokce Hatun!

29:58.373 --> 30:00.040
Always Ertugrul.

30:01.006 --> 30:03.240
I cannot put my nomad tent in danger
because of his ambition.

30:03.473 --> 30:05.273
He should have taken care of
his nomad tent

30:05.340 --> 30:07.740
instead of spending time with his wife.

30:10.006 --> 30:13.306
He should have been a real Alp to see
the trap laid by his traitor men.

30:13.740 --> 30:15.840
Don't talk to me about Ertugrul
ever again!

30:17.806 --> 30:19.040
Ever!

30:20.073 --> 30:21.073
Alright.

31:04.373 --> 31:05.473
What happened, Hatun?

31:06.773 --> 31:08.040
Nothing, Bey.

31:11.306 --> 31:12.406
Tell me, what happened?

31:20.240 --> 31:22.473
I am scared that we are going to
perish in this place

31:22.740 --> 31:24.940
when we are running away
from Mongol invasion.

31:26.173 --> 31:28.373
Do not beat around the bush, tell me.

31:30.473 --> 31:34.240
You rely on your uncle and
Tugtekin too much, Gundogdu.

31:35.373 --> 31:36.906
God, give me patience.

31:37.240 --> 31:40.940
Selcan, I do not rely on anyone.

31:41.173 --> 31:47.073
But if Kayi tribe wants to live
and get out of this trouble

31:47.206 --> 31:49.373
we have no choice but to live with them.

31:49.740 --> 31:53.906
Aytolun manipulates your uncle
and Tugtekin but you cannot see it.

31:54.073 --> 31:58.073
And this truth you cannot see
will be our end someday.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.006
Where did that come from?

32:04.973 --> 32:06.073
Gokce.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.973
Aytolun wants to take her
under her control.

32:11.106 --> 32:13.306
Like she did to your uncle and Tugtekin.

32:13.740 --> 32:14.940
Gokce?

32:15.440 --> 32:18.273
You are talking like this because
she is not with you anymore.

32:19.006 --> 32:21.173
You are jealous because
she is close to Aytolun.

32:21.940 --> 32:26.240
She is my dear, my sister. I raised her.

32:26.540 --> 32:30.306
Selcan, you are talking like this
because she is an adult now.

32:31.440 --> 32:33.140
What are you saying, Gundogdu?

32:34.506 --> 32:36.140
You heard it, Hatun.

32:36.873 --> 32:39.073
That is right, you raised Gokce.

32:39.440 --> 32:43.006
But you did not just raise her,
you thought of her as your family.

32:43.340 --> 32:47.506
You took her for your unborn child
and cared her that way.

32:48.040 --> 32:49.840
What am I trying to say is

32:49.973 --> 32:53.106
Gokce does not need you,
you need her.

32:53.406 --> 32:54.940
-Enough.
-Is that wrong?

32:55.006 --> 32:56.073
Enough.

32:56.473 --> 32:59.340
You are doing this because
she is with Aytolun now.

32:59.506 --> 33:02.073
Give her a break.

33:02.940 --> 33:05.740
She lives in your shadow instead of
getting married.

33:09.540 --> 33:13.806
Save your concerns to yourself.
I have more important things to do.

33:26.506 --> 33:31.740
Sins of my past will never leave me.

33:32.406 --> 33:33.806
Never.

34:07.106 --> 34:08.406
What happened, Kocabash?

34:09.106 --> 34:10.906
My horse threw me off.

34:11.906 --> 34:13.306
Do you need help?

34:14.140 --> 34:15.373
I can handle it.

34:44.173 --> 34:45.806
Are you sure you did not fall of it?

34:47.440 --> 34:49.906
That horse doesn't look like
it has a temper.

34:51.906 --> 34:54.406
They say you are not the commander of
Alps anymore.

34:57.740 --> 35:00.340
Looks like being the son of Suleyman Shah
or defeating the Crusaders...

35:01.040 --> 35:02.806
...was not enough to save you.

35:03.473 --> 35:06.806
In the end you are no more than a
pathetic Turkmen.

35:11.006 --> 35:13.306
Apparently, you know that
I have a lame hand.

35:14.339 --> 35:17.473
And your tongue grew bold.
-Take my life then.

35:19.540 --> 35:22.839
I will take it when the time is right,
do not worry.

35:38.406 --> 35:39.540
From now on...

35:40.740 --> 35:42.806
...do not try to ride a horse
you cannot control.

36:03.906 --> 36:06.206
Bey is not an Alp anymore, right?

36:07.973 --> 36:11.873
Neither a Bey in headquarters,
nor the commander of Alps.

36:15.740 --> 36:19.506
Mother Hayme and Gundogdu Bey.
How could they do it?

36:20.206 --> 36:24.973
Everyone is scared that they won't be
able to stop Ertugrul Bey against Mongols.

36:32.006 --> 36:34.873
-You summoned me, Wild Demir.
-I got something to tell you.

36:36.773 --> 36:37.840
What happened?

36:38.006 --> 36:40.406
Judgments were given about you
in headquarters.

36:45.240 --> 36:46.240
Dogan.

36:47.806 --> 36:48.906
Turgut.

36:50.006 --> 36:56.040
You are under the command of Ertugrul Bey.

36:58.373 --> 37:02.540
Any mistake would get our Bey in trouble.
Act accordingly.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.040
What about me?

37:07.040 --> 37:11.073
Your situation is more complicated,
Abdurrahman.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.140
Abdurrahman.

37:24.140 --> 37:27.073
Take of your weapons
and give them to Alps.

37:46.440 --> 37:49.240
-Do you hear yourself, Bogac?
-Dogan!

37:51.273 --> 37:55.040
You must take an Alp's life
before you get his arms.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.940
I will do it without blinking an eye,
Dogan. Tread lightly.

37:58.140 --> 38:00.040
-Then come and get it.
-Abdurrahman!

38:06.540 --> 38:08.006
Hand over your arms.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.306
What are you saying, Father?

38:11.973 --> 38:14.140
Wild Demir, please.

38:15.740 --> 38:17.140
It is headquarters' judgment.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.206
You will stay in the prison tent

38:21.806 --> 38:25.540
until we learn if you helped Mongols

38:25.873 --> 38:29.373
by betraying Gundogdu Bey
and Tugtekin Bey.

38:33.340 --> 38:37.873
My Bey ordered me not to give quarter
if you resist.

38:39.340 --> 38:41.306
-I will gouge your eyes out!
-Turgut!

38:45.040 --> 38:47.206
Abdurrahman! Hand over your arms!

38:49.273 --> 38:50.373
Hand them over!

38:52.506 --> 38:54.440
What if his innocence cannot be proven?

38:55.940 --> 38:57.906
Then he will die there.

38:58.406 --> 39:01.006
<i>Prison tent.</i>

39:11.206 --> 39:12.806
<i>You have lost your mind.</i>

39:13.273 --> 39:15.440
<i>My brother's innocence will</i>
 <i>come to light sooner or later.</i>

39:17.106 --> 39:19.106
<i>Then, you will pay for this!</i>

40:33.206 --> 40:34.273
Enough!

40:35.006 --> 40:36.073
Enough!

40:40.540 --> 40:43.006
Abdurrahman! Enough!

40:57.106 --> 40:58.740
You will pay for this.

41:02.106 --> 41:03.106
Samsa!

41:14.840 --> 41:16.440
The real conflict starts now.

41:25.473 --> 41:26.740
Abdurrahman!

41:28.006 --> 41:30.373
-Where are you going?
-Take care of my arms.

41:33.806 --> 41:35.140
Where are you going?

41:38.173 --> 41:39.373
To where I have to go.

42:02.806 --> 42:03.806
Halime.

42:08.273 --> 42:09.273
Halime!

42:12.140 --> 42:15.040
So, you have cornered Ertugrul
with Mother Hayme.

42:17.740 --> 42:20.440
Only now your conscience burdens you so,
Halime?

42:23.506 --> 42:26.506
We said that it was not easy
to be the wife of an Alp

42:26.906 --> 42:28.373
and you laughed at us.

42:30.440 --> 42:34.440
This is as far as a palace girl can go.

42:36.873 --> 42:38.040
Gokce.

42:40.240 --> 42:41.473
Haven't you had enough?

42:43.273 --> 42:44.306
Look at this.

42:47.373 --> 42:48.873
You hate me.

42:52.006 --> 42:53.806
How long will this go on?

42:54.373 --> 42:56.340
I do not care about you, Halime.

42:58.806 --> 43:02.773
I don't care about you being here
or not. Not even a little.

43:04.940 --> 43:07.373
I am talking about
what you did to Ertugrul.

43:08.540 --> 43:12.406
If you have a drop of conscience,
think about what you did with my mother.

43:38.106 --> 43:39.106
Let me go!

44:24.106 --> 44:28.773
The arrow that strikes the eagle is made
from its own feather, Ak Tolgali.

44:30.773 --> 44:31.806
My mother...

44:33.106 --> 44:35.840
...my brother, my lover...

44:37.240 --> 44:38.940
...have stopped me.

44:40.040 --> 44:41.973
They told me not to overstep my bounds.

44:44.173 --> 44:48.273
They told me to stay put against a tyrant.

44:51.806 --> 44:56.006
"You cannot hold a sword, stop dreaming."
they said.

44:58.373 --> 44:59.740
And what did I say?

45:01.973 --> 45:05.306
I will never bow down to the
order of this mortal world...

45:06.806 --> 45:08.740
...and let these tyrants do as they will.

45:09.973 --> 45:11.240
Never.

45:13.340 --> 45:17.273
Son of Suleyman Shah does not give up.

45:18.873 --> 45:21.973
He never asks for mercy.

45:42.073 --> 45:45.173
All these lands you see are ours, Hamza.

45:47.073 --> 45:50.073
The men who stood with us
has bathed in glory.

45:51.306 --> 45:55.406
You are with glorious people.

45:58.906 --> 46:00.473
But Kayi Tribe is my tribe.

46:01.206 --> 46:03.106
They will be spared, Noyan.

46:05.740 --> 46:08.006
We do not care about the herd, Hamza.

46:08.973 --> 46:12.206
Our problem is that herd's shepherd.

46:14.040 --> 46:17.340
We want you to be the shepherd this herd.

46:19.173 --> 46:21.006
Mongols will not remain in these lands.

46:21.873 --> 46:26.240
After we leave, you will shepherd
the herd on behalf of us.

46:27.306 --> 46:28.740
You will be a Bey.

46:59.406 --> 47:02.906
They cast Ertugrul out of headquarters
and took his status of Alp away.

47:25.073 --> 47:26.840
Your tribe is on fire, Hamza.

47:28.273 --> 47:29.806
We need to put it out.

47:32.506 --> 47:34.306
I have put many fires out in the past.

47:35.306 --> 47:39.173
But you will not touch the herd...

47:40.373 --> 47:42.106
...after you take their shepherd away.

47:45.073 --> 47:46.940
I swear on holy spirits.

47:48.106 --> 47:49.406
The herd will be yours.

48:12.273 --> 48:13.506
Hamza is in our hands.

48:14.506 --> 48:17.873
But we have been here for so long,
why don't we hunt?

48:18.740 --> 48:23.173
We do not hunt, because we want
our prey to grow fat.

48:24.140 --> 48:26.840
So, they will be worth our while, Tangut.

48:28.140 --> 48:29.240
Have patience.

49:03.406 --> 49:06.273
-May it be easy, daughter.
-Thank you, mother.

49:28.840 --> 49:30.373
Any words about Ertugrul?

49:32.473 --> 49:33.806
No, mother.

49:37.740 --> 49:39.473
He was like this when he was a kid.

49:40.206 --> 49:42.940
He strived until he got what he wanted.

49:44.206 --> 49:45.740
He would never give up.

49:46.740 --> 49:50.873
Then, he would find a way to convince us.

49:57.940 --> 50:02.840
Today, I saw his thirst for vengeance
against the Mongols in his eyes.

50:09.006 --> 50:14.206
Nobody would endure that much agony,
yet he survived and came back to us.

50:18.273 --> 50:20.240
If I had given permission to him

50:21.906 --> 50:24.406
to fight with the Mongols

50:25.006 --> 50:29.440
he would have perished along with his men.

50:35.806 --> 50:39.240
I cannot endure this pain,
Halime, daughter.

50:42.173 --> 50:43.840
I was scared, too, mother.

50:45.506 --> 50:48.406
I was too scared to lose him
for the first time.

50:55.106 --> 50:57.873
Every Bey in headquarters
fears the Mongols

50:58.440 --> 51:01.140
yet none of them can say it out loud.

51:02.840 --> 51:04.206
People are on the edge.

51:05.973 --> 51:10.973
I hope Sultan Aleaddin will rush to
our aid with his army soon.

51:13.473 --> 51:15.540
-If God permits.
-If God permits, mother.

51:16.873 --> 51:18.140
If God permits.

51:26.806 --> 51:28.173
Fortunately, Bamsi is not here

51:28.540 --> 51:31.140
or we'd have to
deal with his craziness as well.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.540
I wish we all could be like him.

51:42.540 --> 51:46.306
All of this has happened because
we listened to the voice of reason.

51:57.340 --> 52:02.206
I am tired of listening to the
voice of reason.

52:06.906 --> 52:08.773
I have nothing to lose.

52:24.273 --> 52:26.506
Tugtekin Bey called Alps
to the training yard.

53:06.940 --> 53:08.106
Look at them.

53:12.940 --> 53:14.940
How long do we put up with them, brother?

53:39.373 --> 53:41.906
It is time to put you in your place.

53:43.240 --> 53:45.006
Turgut and Dogan.

53:45.773 --> 53:48.440
You are as stubborn as Ertugrul Bey.

53:49.973 --> 53:52.806
You are reckless men
who do not know obedience.

53:56.873 --> 53:58.240
Do not bother.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.273
We have talked among ourselves...

54:01.806 --> 54:03.773
...and decided that we are hopeless.

54:07.373 --> 54:10.073
From now on, we are not Alps of
this nomad tent.

54:11.806 --> 54:14.373
Since we are under
Ertugrul Bey's command

54:15.840 --> 54:20.273
and he is relieved of his position,
we are not Alps as well.

54:22.006 --> 54:25.840
Until he time he resumes command,
we will not take any order from you.

54:28.006 --> 54:30.306
Who do you think you are to glower at me?

54:33.340 --> 54:35.340
Alps, take them down!

54:37.040 --> 54:38.240
Stop!

54:38.373 --> 54:40.873
-Brother!
-I cannot let you do this, Tugtekin!

54:42.340 --> 54:44.240
Sheathe your swords!

54:51.973 --> 54:53.373
This is no battlefield!

54:53.506 --> 54:58.106
From now on, none of the Alps will
draw a sword against each other!

55:01.540 --> 55:02.873
And you!

55:04.373 --> 55:07.340
If you are no longer Alps anymore,
leave this place!

55:09.506 --> 55:11.273
Let everyone know that!

55:19.273 --> 55:20.906
Turgut! Dogan!

55:28.173 --> 55:30.073
Do not think about crossing my path!

55:31.973 --> 55:33.340
You, too.

55:33.906 --> 55:38.073
We will not show mercy to you
or the dogs would you put our trail.

55:39.540 --> 55:40.973
Bey.

56:24.906 --> 56:29.206
My uncle, Tugtekin, my brother

56:30.373 --> 56:33.340
they all want to pass winter
by waiting for the Mongolian army.

56:35.806 --> 56:37.473
They think Noyan will do the same.

56:38.740 --> 56:40.006
But they are wrong.

56:41.373 --> 56:43.340
How does a hand hold a sword?

56:44.106 --> 56:45.840
How does a sword seek a hand?

56:46.973 --> 56:50.406
You are alone, the sword is alone,
the nomad tent is alone.

56:51.340 --> 56:52.973
The whole world is alone.

56:54.373 --> 56:57.306
Less has conquered many in the past,
Geyikli.

56:58.973 --> 57:02.173
We know how to snap infidels' neck
without swords as well.

57:02.740 --> 57:06.173
Tell me, who are these infidels?

57:06.440 --> 57:09.140
Do they reside inside of you?

57:12.206 --> 57:13.540
All right.

57:14.406 --> 57:17.240
They are inside and outside.

57:18.140 --> 57:23.806
You and Abdurrahman will be my
biggest aides in this.

57:24.040 --> 57:26.106
You said Abdurrahman was taken prisoner.

57:26.406 --> 57:28.740
It is in my favour.

57:30.373 --> 57:34.073
They took Abraham and
cast Josseph in a well

57:34.940 --> 57:36.940
they crucified Jesus

57:37.940 --> 57:39.906
exiled Moses to a mountain

57:40.440 --> 57:44.773
but God granted them
strenght and they were saved.

57:46.073 --> 57:47.340
Well said.

57:49.240 --> 57:51.740
We will send Abdurrahman
to Noyan as a spy.

57:52.040 --> 57:53.540
He will be Noyan's man.

57:54.440 --> 57:58.073
What do you want me to do?
And what do I ask of you in return?

57:58.940 --> 58:02.773
I want you to escort Abdurrahman
to Noyan's place.

58:05.240 --> 58:06.906
What you want sounds nice

58:07.773 --> 58:09.373
but seems a little hard to do.

58:11.506 --> 58:13.940
There is no such thing for you, Geyikli.

58:14.473 --> 58:16.873
Look who's talking now.

58:17.440 --> 58:20.106
The one who is untrappable.

58:22.940 --> 58:24.073
Thank you.

58:38.140 --> 58:39.773
You pillaged everywhere.

58:41.106 --> 58:42.940
You can't go far with this cruelty, Noyan.

58:43.973 --> 58:45.773
This is not cruelty, Hamza.

58:46.873 --> 58:50.006
We are merely giving an honorable death
to the people whose time has come.

58:50.840 --> 58:52.740
How long will your campaign last?

58:56.540 --> 58:58.973
Until Genghis Khan's children
will rule the world.

58:59.506 --> 59:02.473
Just like the God is the
only ruler in the sky.

59:04.473 --> 59:08.806
The world will know peace
and happiness on that day, Hamza.

59:12.373 --> 59:14.440
You have many Turks in your army.

59:17.040 --> 59:18.773
My mother is a Turk, too.

59:20.740 --> 59:22.440
We are brothers on my mother's side.

59:24.206 --> 59:26.006
Why did you attack Kayi Tribe?

59:29.140 --> 59:30.740
To capture Ertugrul.

59:32.940 --> 59:35.340
We were going to make him
the ruler of Anatolia.

59:39.173 --> 59:41.240
But we found you now.

59:43.440 --> 59:45.006
Do not forget, Hamza.

59:45.340 --> 59:49.140
Only the blood can purify humanity.

01:00:27.982 --> 01:00:31.816
Your anger captured you.

01:00:33.582 --> 01:00:34.649
Give me a break!

01:00:34.916 --> 01:00:36.182
Give me a break, mother!

01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:39.749
Give me a break! Give me a break!

01:00:42.716 --> 01:00:45.416
You must control your anger patience.

01:00:45.882 --> 01:00:51.649
You must learn to use it
as a weapon for your enemies.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.149
What are you saying, mother?

01:00:56.182 --> 01:00:59.149
Ertugrul is here, among us,
in headquarters!

01:01:00.849 --> 01:01:02.582
His Alps threatened me
in front of everyone!

01:01:03.416 --> 01:01:06.182
They humiliated me! They challenged me!

01:01:08.449 --> 01:01:10.182
I was silent to their arrogances.

01:01:11.882 --> 01:01:15.116
I was silent for Gundogdu brother!

01:01:15.816 --> 01:01:18.582
I was silent for my father!

01:01:23.849 --> 01:01:26.582
Your anger prevents you
to see your victory.

01:01:27.749 --> 01:01:31.516
You got rid of those irregular Alps
after Ertugrul.

01:01:32.082 --> 01:01:34.782
Now it is easier to perish them for you.

01:01:41.416 --> 01:01:43.982
You won a huge victory today, Tugtekin.

01:01:44.649 --> 01:01:49.582
You won this victory by fling Ertugrul's
being one-handed in his teeth

01:01:50.082 --> 01:01:54.516
and being silent to arrogance of his Alps.

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:01.582
You call this victory, mother?

01:02:03.849 --> 01:02:07.815
Victory is everything which takes you
to your goal, Tugtekin.

01:02:09.716 --> 01:02:10.849
Mark my words.

01:02:14.149 --> 01:02:15.149
Now...

01:02:17.016 --> 01:02:21.082
...Gokce will be last part
of your victory.

01:02:39.582 --> 01:02:43.049
She did not call for us, she is coming
herself so we are wrecked.

01:02:44.782 --> 01:02:45.782
Welcome, Mother Hayme.

01:02:46.749 --> 01:02:48.882
Are you mentor of these
crazies, Wild Demir?

01:02:50.749 --> 01:02:52.949
It was our decision not
to be Alp, Mother Hayme.

01:02:56.916 --> 01:02:58.849
I raised both of you as my child.

01:02:59.849 --> 01:03:02.149
How could you do this without asking me?

01:03:04.816 --> 01:03:09.616
We made a mistake by not telling you.
But what happened to Ertugrul Bey...

01:03:10.482 --> 01:03:12.049
Then, they came for Abdurrahman.

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:16.049
We are no good to anyone, mother.

01:03:18.482 --> 01:03:20.016
-Forgive us, mother.
-Forgive us, mother.

01:03:23.949 --> 01:03:27.482
Just like fire grows with air

01:03:28.582 --> 01:03:31.449
Alps trained by obedience in nomad tent.

01:03:34.449 --> 01:03:35.916
You broke your traditions.

01:03:37.949 --> 01:03:40.516
You gave your decision without
asking your Mother Hayme.

01:03:41.082 --> 01:03:44.749
You could not be patient.
From now on, you are not a man.

01:03:48.416 --> 01:03:49.416
Mother Hayme.

01:03:49.916 --> 01:03:50.916
Wild Demir.

01:03:52.649 --> 01:03:54.016
Do not break your traditions, too.

01:03:55.116 --> 01:03:56.816
Do not discuss my words.

01:05:33.982 --> 01:05:35.982
Bey, your hand is as strong as your heart.

01:05:37.482 --> 01:05:38.949
It did not wear well to damages.

01:05:40.782 --> 01:05:44.082
My hand and my heart could bear
Mongol tyranny, Artuk Bey.

01:05:45.616 --> 01:05:46.716
But my nomad tent could not.

01:05:47.449 --> 01:05:50.449
Do not think people are
as brave as you, Ertugrul Bey.

01:05:51.582 --> 01:05:56.216
If anyone were you, you would be anyone.

01:06:00.149 --> 01:06:03.816
Is this lame handed Alp
could grab a sword again?

01:06:04.516 --> 01:06:06.516
I wish you heal with the name of God

01:06:07.416 --> 01:06:10.549
and get rid of everything
that gives you pain

01:06:11.649 --> 01:06:13.849
every evil eye and every evil person.

01:06:15.149 --> 01:06:17.849
I hope you get better soon.

01:06:19.782 --> 01:06:20.782
Thank you.

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:28.549
Why did you vote against me
in headquarters?

01:06:31.582 --> 01:06:32.782
If I had voted for you

01:06:34.482 --> 01:06:36.182
you could not have found me
in headquarters

01:06:36.649 --> 01:06:37.849
when you needed me again.

01:06:51.882 --> 01:06:52.882
Who are they?

01:06:53.149 --> 01:06:56.016
They are the ones who will take your duty.

01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:01.549
I mean, the ones want to obey.
-Duties?

01:07:01.949 --> 01:07:03.482
They are Beys, officers and viziers.

01:07:08.449 --> 01:07:11.416
Welcome before Noyan the representative
of great Ogeday.

01:08:20.716 --> 01:08:22.749
If you were not perfect...

01:08:27.782 --> 01:08:29.216
...I would kill all men.

01:08:59.616 --> 01:09:00.949
But I would not kill women.

01:09:05.182 --> 01:09:06.182
We are ready, Efendi.

01:09:27.049 --> 01:09:29.216
My favorite scent is woman after blood.

01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:37.082
I fit the horse with shoes, let it rest.

01:09:37.716 --> 01:09:39.416
Thank you, stableboy. Thank you.

01:09:57.916 --> 01:09:58.949
So, you are back.

01:10:00.816 --> 01:10:04.182
We did not feel the absence of you
because of your Alps, Turgut and Dogan.

01:10:05.216 --> 01:10:07.916
They are not Alps to be on your side.

01:10:09.582 --> 01:10:12.416
They did it by challenging Tugtekin
in front of everyone.

01:10:13.649 --> 01:10:14.749
They humiliated us.

01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:19.149
Instead of worrying about these,
be careful about the danger coming.

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:23.149
Our nomad tent is under a treat
like it has never been.

01:10:23.849 --> 01:10:25.449
There is a treat, you are right.

01:10:25.849 --> 01:10:27.816
But the treat is you, my brother!

01:10:28.549 --> 01:10:29.916
You and your rascal Alps!

01:10:31.449 --> 01:10:33.649
I said I would obey headquarters
judgments, brother.

01:10:34.749 --> 01:10:37.949
You were going to obey headquarters
judgments, tell me another one!

01:10:38.716 --> 01:10:42.082
You did not obey your father's
headquarters judgments, do not fool me!

01:10:42.982 --> 01:10:44.116
What do you want, brother?

01:10:44.516 --> 01:10:47.949
If you want me go, I will go
without hesitation.

01:10:48.782 --> 01:10:53.782
You put us in shit up to our necks,
now you want to go, huh?

01:10:54.882 --> 01:10:55.949
What do you mean?

01:10:56.116 --> 01:10:59.716
I mean, calm down and stay with your wife.

01:11:00.749 --> 01:11:02.782
She did not have a good day
because of you.

01:11:03.516 --> 01:11:05.516
At least, a winter would be
in peace in nomad tent.

01:12:12.782 --> 01:12:14.449
-Tangut.
-Yes, Bey.

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:16.916
They will eat it standing.

01:12:20.716 --> 01:12:21.716
They will.

01:12:27.182 --> 01:12:28.516
Can they eat it?

01:12:30.116 --> 01:12:31.516
They had better eat it.

01:12:39.782 --> 01:12:42.582
Whatever, they are coming from away.

01:12:44.016 --> 01:12:45.182
They may sit down.

01:12:46.649 --> 01:12:47.716
Sit down. Sit down.

01:13:04.649 --> 01:13:05.716
Enjoy it.

01:13:30.216 --> 01:13:31.216
Tangut.

01:13:32.049 --> 01:13:33.082
Yes, Bey.

01:13:33.716 --> 01:13:36.782
The animals of Anatolia are delicious.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:40.949
They are, Bey.

01:13:47.216 --> 01:13:49.449
They did not give you food
in Aleaddin's palace, I guess.

01:13:50.882 --> 01:13:52.082
Meat is delicious.

01:13:53.549 --> 01:13:54.649
I cannot stop myself.

01:13:55.616 --> 01:13:57.749
Have them all. Enjoy it.

01:13:58.916 --> 01:13:59.982
Enjoy it.

01:14:05.516 --> 01:14:06.682
Let us get down to business.

01:14:08.516 --> 01:14:09.916
The Beys want to show obedience.

01:14:11.182 --> 01:14:13.149
They want to be tied to Ogeday's state.

01:14:16.516 --> 01:14:17.749
Is that right, Beys?

01:14:19.982 --> 01:14:21.482
-It is right.
-It is right.

01:14:23.049 --> 01:14:24.049
It is right.

01:14:28.616 --> 01:14:29.982
Why do you want to be with us?

01:14:31.416 --> 01:14:32.916
To be Bey and grow with you.

01:14:33.216 --> 01:14:34.849
Because we could not stop you.

01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:38.482
To be together and found stronger states.

01:14:43.916 --> 01:14:47.449
I wish your Beys and Sultans
would be as smart as you.

01:14:52.515 --> 01:14:55.682
We always need Beys like you.

01:15:00.882 --> 01:15:03.082
Being with you is dangerous for us.

01:15:05.616 --> 01:15:06.816
What do we get in return?

01:15:16.549 --> 01:15:17.549
Return?

01:15:27.016 --> 01:15:28.016
Bring it!

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:52.416
Open it.

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.649
Everyone will be happy.

01:16:29.882 --> 01:16:30.882
Thank you.

01:16:32.016 --> 01:16:33.082
Everyone.

01:16:36.982 --> 01:16:38.149
Are you ready, Ulubilge?

01:18:34.549 --> 01:18:36.416
If you betray to your own Beys and Sultans

01:18:37.449 --> 01:18:38.782
you will betray me sooner!

01:18:41.949 --> 01:18:43.016
Eat!

01:18:43.482 --> 01:18:44.549
Eat! Eat!

01:19:20.982 --> 01:19:25.949
We make Bey whom we want,
not the ones come to us.

01:19:28.616 --> 01:19:29.949
Comprehend us fully, Hamza.

01:19:32.649 --> 01:19:33.982
Know the value of it, Hamza.

01:19:39.049 --> 01:19:40.449
Bring my food to my tent.

01:20:47.582 --> 01:20:48.816
I know you are offended to me.

01:20:51.849 --> 01:20:55.016
You do not share your troubles, either.

01:20:55.982 --> 01:20:57.616
It hurts me more.

01:21:04.816 --> 01:21:06.016
How could I be offended to you, mother?

01:21:08.216 --> 01:21:11.649
I would sacrifice my very life to you.

01:21:16.682 --> 01:21:17.849
Perhaps, I made a mistake.

01:21:20.182 --> 01:21:23.149
When I gave my decision and
raised my hand in headquarters

01:21:24.749 --> 01:21:26.682
other Beys raised their hands after me.

01:21:29.749 --> 01:21:31.449
It is too late to think
about this, mother.

01:21:33.449 --> 01:21:34.449
We got hurt.

01:21:36.582 --> 01:21:37.882
We got hurt so much that

01:21:39.716 --> 01:21:43.716
the nomad tent of Suleyman Shah
took shelter in another nomad tent.

01:21:45.582 --> 01:21:49.216
My brother and you gave wrong decisions.

01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:54.016
We had to, my son.

01:21:55.716 --> 01:21:56.749
We had to.

01:21:57.849 --> 01:22:00.149
Perhaps but

01:22:02.682 --> 01:22:06.449
we will understand when you pay
for your decisions.

01:22:27.082 --> 01:22:31.016
How could I let you to put yourself

01:22:32.016 --> 01:22:35.982
and your nomad tent in danger
with this hand?

01:22:41.949 --> 01:22:43.082
I am your mother.

01:22:45.982 --> 01:22:47.016
Please understand me.

01:23:00.216 --> 01:23:03.516
You are mother and Bey.

01:23:05.482 --> 01:23:06.582
We must obey you.

01:23:10.482 --> 01:23:11.482
But...

01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:16.916
...I will do what is right for me.

01:23:19.216 --> 01:23:20.216
Do not worry.

01:23:21.782 --> 01:23:22.949
I will not stand against you.

01:23:25.516 --> 01:23:28.916
But do not stand against me.

01:23:30.582 --> 01:23:35.416
Or I understand I have no place
in this nomad tent and I leave.

01:23:36.682 --> 01:23:37.782
Be aware of this.

01:24:32.416 --> 01:24:34.082
When will Ertugrul Bey come
and talk to us, father?

01:24:35.782 --> 01:24:38.516
Our Bey has his plans. Have patience.

01:24:44.116 --> 01:24:45.882
Have patience? How long do we have
to bear this?

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:49.216
I could not bear anymore.

01:24:58.416 --> 01:25:00.182
I heard that you are not Alp anymore.

01:25:02.182 --> 01:25:04.949
We did it without asking you, forgive us.

01:25:07.216 --> 01:25:11.782
Even we exiled from nomad tent
or get hanged, we are with you.

01:25:12.416 --> 01:25:13.416
We want them know.

01:25:33.916 --> 01:25:38.016
If we are together till the end, be ready.

01:25:39.949 --> 01:25:41.016
Be ready for what, Bey?

01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:47.549
First thing is freeing Abdurrahman
from caged tent.

01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:57.016
Whenever you want, we are ready Bey.

01:26:00.016 --> 01:26:01.016
But...

01:26:04.816 --> 01:26:06.082
...it must be as if he escaped.

01:26:09.782 --> 01:26:11.616
Then, Bey? What are we going to do then?

01:26:12.949 --> 01:26:13.949
Have patience.

01:26:18.649 --> 01:26:21.616
Bey, what do you want from me?

01:26:23.216 --> 01:26:24.416
Make something

01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:30.149
that would be armor to my hand
and give strength to my lame hand.

01:26:31.449 --> 01:26:38.416
Bey, I will make something like a claw
that would wrap your hand.

01:26:39.082 --> 01:26:42.816
You hold your zulfiqar with it and
you will take our revenge with it.

01:28:09.882 --> 01:28:10.916
Leave us alone.

01:28:11.549 --> 01:28:13.616
Bey, do not. Tugtekin Bey ordered.

01:28:13.782 --> 01:28:15.849
He could talk to me, leave.

01:28:24.816 --> 01:28:26.416
How could I go to Noyan
while I am in cage?

01:28:26.982 --> 01:28:28.116
We will let you out.

01:28:28.982 --> 01:28:30.782
Be ready and wait for it.

01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:33.616
It is a good thing you are caged.

01:28:34.882 --> 01:28:37.982
When you go to obey Noyan,
you will be more persuasive.

01:28:45.849 --> 01:28:50.682
He hates not just me
but everything, everyone.

01:28:51.816 --> 01:28:52.982
It is all my fault.

01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:57.482
Do not wear yourself off.

01:28:59.816 --> 01:29:01.882
We are all going through hard times.

01:29:03.616 --> 01:29:04.649
Gokce, too.

01:29:06.016 --> 01:29:07.916
She did not mean that, I am sure.

01:29:09.182 --> 01:29:11.416
She meant it, mother, I know.

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:16.416
I took everything she got.

01:29:19.916 --> 01:29:22.982
Her hopes, dreams of starting a family.

01:29:25.549 --> 01:29:26.916
She cannot have a baby.

01:29:34.016 --> 01:29:36.749
My daughter, do not worry.

01:29:37.516 --> 01:29:39.516
I talk to her, alright?

01:29:40.416 --> 01:29:45.949
Mother, Aytolun took Gokce
under her control

01:29:47.216 --> 01:29:51.516
and poisoning her and I cannot
do anything about it.

01:29:56.549 --> 01:30:00.216
Please mother, save my sister
from that woman.

01:30:02.416 --> 01:30:03.416
Alright.

01:30:04.949 --> 01:30:08.116
I will talk to her. Do not worry. Alright.

01:30:36.449 --> 01:30:38.416
I collected goods of Kayi
remains from attack.

01:30:39.082 --> 01:30:40.849
I will talk to a merchant tomorrow.

01:30:41.649 --> 01:30:44.582
But as far as I heard
there is not much wheat left.

01:30:46.716 --> 01:30:47.749
I do not think so.

01:30:48.916 --> 01:30:52.116
They want to earn more
by saying there is less.

01:30:55.882 --> 01:30:57.182
So, level them with ground.

01:31:00.182 --> 01:31:02.182
Easy cousin, what are you saying?

01:31:02.616 --> 01:31:06.582
You cannot fight all the time,
you must be a merchant sometime.

01:31:10.149 --> 01:31:11.616
Gundogdu speaks the truth.

01:31:13.582 --> 01:31:16.482
Nomads do not know pleasure of gold
while herding.

01:31:26.182 --> 01:31:29.016
I hope you like our food, Gundogdu Bey?

01:31:29.516 --> 01:31:31.416
I made them with my hands for you.

01:31:31.849 --> 01:31:35.649
Thank you, Aytolun Hatun.
They are all delicious.

01:31:39.516 --> 01:31:41.482
Mongols are going to attack us
like pack of dogs.

01:31:42.449 --> 01:31:43.782
There are less nomads.

01:31:45.449 --> 01:31:49.116
The women of day always spend time
with their husbands in bed

01:31:49.449 --> 01:31:51.582
even if they do not give a baby, Bey.

01:31:52.182 --> 01:31:56.049
In old times if a women
could not have a baby

01:31:56.216 --> 01:31:58.682
she would bring another woman
to family to have a baby.

01:32:00.416 --> 01:32:05.482
Also, the men of today have patience,
they do not divorce infertile women.

01:32:43.616 --> 01:32:47.716
Tell the one who sent you here
Ertugrul Bey would kill me next time.

01:33:25.849 --> 01:33:26.949
Good night, Ertugrul Bey.

01:33:28.616 --> 01:33:29.649
Thank you, Gokce.

01:33:30.716 --> 01:33:31.716
Bey.

01:33:37.882 --> 01:33:40.849
What they did to you in headquarters
was not right.

01:33:42.749 --> 01:33:44.782
Even after what you did
for our nomad tent.

01:33:45.782 --> 01:33:47.116
They gave an unjust judgment.

01:33:50.482 --> 01:33:51.516
Thank you, Gokce.

01:33:52.016 --> 01:33:53.416
I feel sorry for your hand.

01:33:56.982 --> 01:33:59.116
I learned what that infidel
did to your hand.

01:34:01.782 --> 01:34:04.449
May god curse those inglorious bastards.

01:34:07.016 --> 01:34:09.549
I pray that I get hurt instead,
you get hurt.

01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:20.116
I will pray for your hand
every night and day.

01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:25.782
To grab your sword to take revenge
for bloodshed.

01:34:27.149 --> 01:34:28.416
Hope for the best, Gokce.

01:34:30.416 --> 01:34:31.882
Thank you for your prays, too.

01:34:39.482 --> 01:34:40.682
What are you doing, Gokce?

01:34:42.716 --> 01:34:45.049
We talked about this two years ago.
It is over.

01:34:46.816 --> 01:34:47.882
Or it is not?

01:34:49.616 --> 01:34:51.716
I wrote you in my heart
with fire, Ertugrul.

01:34:53.482 --> 01:34:57.782
How could I forget you as long as I live?

01:34:59.082 --> 01:35:01.782
How? Tell me how?

01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:03.549
What are you saying, Gokce?

01:35:05.482 --> 01:35:07.649
How could I bear to see you
in the same marquee

01:35:08.182 --> 01:35:10.082
with my wife and child?

01:35:11.649 --> 01:35:13.749
How could I live with you
like pangs of conscience?

01:35:15.749 --> 01:35:16.749
Tell me!

01:35:17.882 --> 01:35:19.416
How could you get this idea?

01:35:20.716 --> 01:35:21.716
How?

01:36:07.682 --> 01:36:08.782
Good night, mother.

01:36:09.982 --> 01:36:11.049
You, too, my daughter.

01:36:50.482 --> 01:36:51.949
Is Gokce alright, Ertugrul Bey?

01:36:54.882 --> 01:36:59.782
Artuk said train until
you grab your sword.

01:37:05.849 --> 01:37:06.916
So, train, Bey.

01:37:10.682 --> 01:37:11.916
But that was not my question.

01:37:20.582 --> 01:37:21.682
Gokce is alright.

01:37:23.416 --> 01:37:24.949
I am sick of Gokce, Ertugrul.

01:37:27.149 --> 01:37:29.016
She still loves you.

01:37:31.449 --> 01:37:33.082
And she raised a scorpion in herself.

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:37.849
That scorpion will poison all of us.

01:37:41.482 --> 01:37:43.016
We all know Gokce's scorpion.

01:37:48.582 --> 01:37:49.582
But...

01:37:52.582 --> 01:37:55.916
...I do not know who bite me
on headquarters.

01:38:34.582 --> 01:38:35.949
<i>How could you get this idea?</i>

01:38:37.182 --> 01:38:39.516
<i>How could I bear to see you</i>
 <i>in the same marquee</i>

01:38:40.082 --> 01:38:41.949
<i>with my wife and child?</i>

01:38:42.549 --> 01:38:44.482
<i>How could I live with you</i>
 <i>like pangs of conscience?</i>

01:38:55.516 --> 01:38:56.516
Gokce?

01:38:59.082 --> 01:39:00.082
Bey.

01:39:05.749 --> 01:39:07.149
What are you doing here
in the dead of night?

01:39:08.949 --> 01:39:09.982
I could not sleep, Bey.

01:39:11.216 --> 01:39:12.482
You cried.

01:39:12.782 --> 01:39:14.649
Enough. Give me a break.

01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:21.149
Gokce.

01:39:22.916 --> 01:39:23.916
I...

01:39:34.549 --> 01:39:35.816
I do not know what happened to me.

01:39:39.716 --> 01:39:41.616
Tell me if you need anything.

01:39:42.549 --> 01:39:43.616
If you excuse me.

01:39:44.582 --> 01:39:45.582
Bey.

01:39:54.916 --> 01:39:55.916
Stay here.

01:40:01.549 --> 01:40:02.649
Stay here with me.

01:40:15.682 --> 01:40:16.716
I pulled you apart today.

01:40:20.049 --> 01:40:21.082
Forgive me.

01:40:23.516 --> 01:40:25.482
I wish only you pulled me apart.

01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:27.682
Who pulled you apart, Gokce?

01:40:29.182 --> 01:40:30.849
Tell me and I will bury them.

01:40:32.516 --> 01:40:35.749
I have buried them, do not worry.

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:39.816
They cannot pull me apart from now on.

01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:51.670
<i>Do we have permission?</i>

01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:54.870
Come in.

01:41:03.036 --> 01:41:04.170
I want to see Tugtekin Bey.

01:41:06.136 --> 01:41:08.903
He is out and Korkut Bey is asleep.

01:41:10.636 --> 01:41:12.070
Do you have something to say?

01:41:14.903 --> 01:41:15.903
No, Hanim.

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:18.170
Tell me, Kocabash.

01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:22.836
I can see in your face that
something has happened.

01:41:25.503 --> 01:41:28.636
Ertugrul is up to something.

01:41:31.770 --> 01:41:33.236
I do not know how to say it.

01:41:34.203 --> 01:41:35.203
Tell me.

01:41:35.903 --> 01:41:38.003
If it concerns our tribe,
it concerns me.

01:41:40.536 --> 01:41:42.203
First he met with his Alps secretly.

01:41:43.803 --> 01:41:46.570
Then he met with Abdurrahman
in caged tent.

01:41:48.803 --> 01:41:51.170
He sent guards outside while
he was talking to Abdurrahman.

01:41:53.903 --> 01:41:55.170
They are up to something.

01:41:57.603 --> 01:41:59.203
Wild Demir is with them, too.

01:42:03.603 --> 01:42:04.770
Listen to me closely.

01:42:05.670 --> 01:42:07.670
I know you respect Tugtekin Bey.

01:42:08.770 --> 01:42:09.836
Thank you, Hanim.

01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:12.536
Likewise, Gundogdu Bey.

01:42:14.503 --> 01:42:17.003
He has trusted you a lot
since you saved his life.

01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:21.936
So, warn Gundogdu Bey.

01:42:23.903 --> 01:42:26.470
Tell him that Ertugrul disappeared...

01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:30.870
...and met with his Alps and Abdurrahman
tell him everything you know.

01:42:32.036 --> 01:42:33.236
Open his eyes.

01:42:35.970 --> 01:42:36.970
Open his eyes...

01:42:38.136 --> 01:42:40.270
...so that Ertugrul will not harm
Tugtekin Bey.

01:42:43.936 --> 01:42:45.003
Do you understand?

01:42:47.736 --> 01:42:48.770
Yes, Hanim.

01:42:51.003 --> 01:42:52.203
I understand very well.

01:43:09.003 --> 01:43:10.803
No one shall know where I will go...

01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:13.903
...or when.

01:43:16.236 --> 01:43:17.836
What about me, Ertugrul?

01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:21.503
You shall not know, too.

01:43:23.236 --> 01:43:24.503
You will wait patiently.

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:32.636
I know your fight is not
just for our baby...

01:43:34.003 --> 01:43:36.136
...but all Kayi babies.

01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:40.903
That consoles me.

01:43:43.836 --> 01:43:45.536
I shall pray for you every day.

01:43:47.636 --> 01:43:49.470
I will grin and bear it.

01:43:54.936 --> 01:43:56.836
They say patience leads to salvation.

01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:04.103
Ertugrul, you need to talk
to your brother.

01:44:05.736 --> 01:44:08.170
You must bring him to
your side whatever the cost.

01:44:10.703 --> 01:44:12.270
Selcan is also very troubled.

01:44:15.636 --> 01:44:16.636
All right.

01:44:20.570 --> 01:44:22.836
I will talk to my brother
for one last time.

01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:25.470
Do not worry.

01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:09.970
Are you going to let him leave
like this, Baycu Noyan?

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:11.470
Yes.

01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:15.536
Until he is lost from view.

01:45:18.036 --> 01:45:21.036
He is wondering whether
I will keep my promise or not.

01:45:21.603 --> 01:45:23.170
He must think that he is free.

01:45:25.770 --> 01:45:27.903
What if he goes and does not come back?

01:45:28.636 --> 01:45:29.703
Then he will die.

01:45:47.203 --> 01:45:49.270
-To earn your friendship.
-Thank you.

01:45:53.136 --> 01:45:54.870
Let your watchman to be around me.

01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:57.470
Noyan's eyes are on you.

01:46:52.503 --> 01:46:56.803
If you want to catch the big fish, Tangut,
you must use big bait.

01:46:58.903 --> 01:47:00.236
Do not forget this.

01:47:15.903 --> 01:47:16.903
Take them.

01:47:25.903 --> 01:47:27.570
You are doing it wrong, move!

01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:39.670
Gokce, what happened?
Why are you upset at this time of the day?

01:47:42.236 --> 01:47:43.770
Leave me alone, sister!

01:47:47.803 --> 01:47:50.570
Selcan Hatun, where is Gundogdu brother?

01:47:51.903 --> 01:47:54.903
He went to a caravan to bargain,
Ertugrul Bey.

01:48:07.736 --> 01:48:11.603
Gokce, did something happen
between you and Ertugrul?

01:49:03.236 --> 01:49:08.536
Thank God, I come across a real Bey,
son of Suleyman Shah.

01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:13.903
Thank God, we met.

01:49:15.803 --> 01:49:18.703
Welcome to Erzurum, Merchant Ahmet.

01:49:19.036 --> 01:49:22.036
I brought greetings and prayers
to you from Konya.

01:49:22.503 --> 01:49:23.570
Peace be upon you.

01:49:24.570 --> 01:49:27.836
My uncle Korkut and Mother Hayme
also sent their greetings to you.

01:49:28.236 --> 01:49:29.470
Thank you.

01:49:30.103 --> 01:49:34.236
Your caravan was raided,
I am sorry to hear that, Bey.

01:49:34.903 --> 01:49:36.803
Thank you. May our friends saved.

01:49:37.603 --> 01:49:38.670
Thank you, Bey.

01:49:45.770 --> 01:49:48.503
Bey, that swine called Noyan is also here.

01:49:49.503 --> 01:49:51.236
May God give you strength and patience.

01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:52.903
If God permits.

01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:54.670
-After you, Bey.
-Bey?

01:49:55.836 --> 01:49:58.870
We took the security measures you asked.
You can be rest assured.

01:49:59.003 --> 01:50:00.536
-Alright.
-After you, Bey.

01:50:13.936 --> 01:50:16.603
Take care of the horses and the tribe.

01:50:21.636 --> 01:50:22.636
Ertugrul!

01:50:29.703 --> 01:50:31.103
Are you going to ironworks?

01:50:31.703 --> 01:50:32.703
Yes, uncle.

01:50:32.936 --> 01:50:34.170
Let us walk together, then.

01:50:39.803 --> 01:50:44.670
I know that the situation
of your tribe hurts you.

01:50:46.070 --> 01:50:48.603
It is unacceptable that the mission
your father gave to you...

01:50:50.903 --> 01:50:53.036
...was taken by my son...

01:50:55.203 --> 01:50:57.070
...and your sword holding hand's
condition.

01:50:59.036 --> 01:51:01.103
But do not forget.

01:51:02.936 --> 01:51:04.070
I am your uncle.

01:51:06.003 --> 01:51:09.670
Your mother is my blood. So are you.

01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:14.536
I want you to know that neither you
nor your siblings...

01:51:14.603 --> 01:51:16.203
...are different from my children.

01:51:19.003 --> 01:51:21.170
There is nothing to worry.

01:51:22.703 --> 01:51:27.103
May God heal your hand first
and you come back among us.

01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:30.970
What I say is...

01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:35.870
...if we want to live in these lands,
we must pay the price.

01:51:37.603 --> 01:51:39.936
We cannot deserve these lands
without blood.

01:51:47.503 --> 01:51:50.470
Protect Halime Sultan.
Do not leave her alone.

01:51:52.536 --> 01:51:55.703
Your baby will bring peace to
your mother and your tribe.

01:51:57.870 --> 01:51:59.003
Do you understand me, son?

01:52:01.903 --> 01:52:02.970
Thank you, uncle.

01:52:03.836 --> 01:52:05.070
May God give you a long life.

01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:37.836
In conclusion, we seek an honest merchant
who will not take advantage.

01:52:39.936 --> 01:52:41.703
A man who will not overprice...

01:52:42.270 --> 01:52:47.136
...because the Mongols are after us,
an honest man.

01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:49.503
May God be my witness...

01:52:50.136 --> 01:52:54.670
...there is no bazaar I have not been
between from Constantine to Konya.

01:52:56.103 --> 01:53:02.703
Your animals are fat, your rugs are
vivid and people love them.

01:53:02.903 --> 01:53:03.903
Thank you.

01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:06.870
Your drapes are worthy of palaces.

01:53:08.836 --> 01:53:13.136
Doing business with Kayi is
profitable for all merchants, Bey.

01:53:14.703 --> 01:53:16.603
If God permits, we will have a deal.

01:53:17.770 --> 01:53:18.970
I have no doubt about it.

01:53:19.936 --> 01:53:20.936
If God permits.

01:53:21.903 --> 01:53:26.603
So, if both sides are willing,
let us start with the help of God.

01:53:28.003 --> 01:53:29.070
You must be hungry.

01:53:29.970 --> 01:53:32.203
-Did Alps take their food, Kocabash?
-They did, Bey.

01:53:33.036 --> 01:53:36.670
Thank you, so we can start.
With the help of God, enjoy.

01:53:48.003 --> 01:53:49.836
What do you think about the situation?

01:53:51.170 --> 01:53:55.270
I listen to many people in many cities.

01:53:56.070 --> 01:54:02.103
I do not know how but it seems that these
bastards will not stop even in the winter.

01:54:06.903 --> 01:54:11.536
They lay waste everywhere not caring for
even mosques and churches, Bey.

01:54:15.736 --> 01:54:18.970
Seljuk does what it can
to protect its people.

01:54:20.236 --> 01:54:25.970
These bastards want to wear out
the people so that they cannot fight.

01:54:27.670 --> 01:54:31.703
<i>We must stop the fear in people</i>
 <i>who are paying tribute to Swine Noyan.</i>

01:54:32.103 --> 01:54:33.703
<i>We must be their hope...</i>

01:54:34.036 --> 01:54:36.936
<i>...so that those bastards</i>
 <i>cannot ask for anything.</i>

01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:41.170
<i>We have to stop the gold cupidity</i>
 <i>of the merchant...</i>

01:54:41.236 --> 01:54:43.503
<i>...who is supplying food</i>
 <i>to the Mongolian army.</i>

01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:48.603
<i>We have to, so that he knows that his hand</i>
 <i>would be cut by us...</i>

01:54:48.670 --> 01:54:50.636
<i>...if he takes their gold once again.</i>

01:54:51.670 --> 01:54:56.603
<i>From now on, we do not have time</i>
 <i>to wait for the enemy and defend.</i>

01:54:57.470 --> 01:55:00.803
<i>We will attack that bastard called</i>
 <i>Noyan and give him hard time...</i>

01:55:00.970 --> 01:55:03.470
<i>...so that he will understand his army</i>
 <i>cannot encamp here.</i>

01:55:07.836 --> 01:55:09.536
I will go and check the Alps, Bey.

01:55:14.636 --> 01:55:15.803
-Bey.
-What?

01:55:16.770 --> 01:55:19.036
I said, I will go and check the Alps, Bey.

01:55:22.503 --> 01:55:23.503
Alright.

01:55:48.036 --> 01:55:49.836
<i>Be careful about the looming danger.</i>

01:55:49.903 --> 01:55:52.603
<i>Our tribe is under a threat</i>
 <i>like it has never been.</i>

01:55:52.803 --> 01:55:54.470
<i>There is a threat, you are right.</i>

01:55:54.836 --> 01:55:56.736
<i>But the threat is you, my brother!</i>

01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:20.736
He trusts me with his life.

01:56:21.903 --> 01:56:23.636
I can kill him anytime.

01:56:24.536 --> 01:56:26.836
Him and his lickspittle merchant.

01:56:28.203 --> 01:56:30.070
Noyan said let them go to the tribe.

01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:34.903
He has another deal
with the merchant and Gundogdu.

01:56:37.636 --> 01:56:38.936
As Efendi Noyan wishes.

01:57:12.670 --> 01:57:14.036
Accept this, Bey.

01:57:39.936 --> 01:57:41.536
You have not taken our goods yet.

01:57:42.570 --> 01:57:44.470
Why are you giving me all this gold?

01:57:44.736 --> 01:57:46.803
To show how much I trust you.

01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:50.736
Know that I will take the herd
and the rugs.

01:57:51.903 --> 01:57:53.570
Go back to your tribe at ease.

01:57:54.736 --> 01:57:55.736
Thank you.

01:57:56.803 --> 01:58:00.003
I am profitable in this business,
I will take the goods.

01:58:02.936 --> 01:58:06.770
I will give rest of gold
when I take the goods.

01:58:09.070 --> 01:58:11.703
When the time is right,
I will get you out of here.

01:58:13.103 --> 01:58:15.170
Your safety is our duty, do not worry.

01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:19.503
With your permission now.

01:58:22.936 --> 01:58:24.603
-Thank you, Bey.
-Good bye.

01:58:26.003 --> 01:58:27.003
Good bye, Bey.

01:58:57.203 --> 01:59:01.003
Wild Demir, you made us happy
when you accepted the mission.

01:59:01.770 --> 01:59:03.903
-Thank you, Bey.
-God bless you.

01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:06.170
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:59:07.103 --> 01:59:13.036
Thank God we have an experienced
and strong ironsmith like you.

01:59:13.603 --> 01:59:14.636
Amen!

01:59:16.770 --> 01:59:22.803
Dodurga and Kayi tribes,
enjoy your new ironworks.

01:59:23.003 --> 01:59:24.036
-Amen!
-Amen!

01:59:26.203 --> 01:59:30.503
I start with the name of God.
With the name of God.

01:59:31.170 --> 01:59:35.136
Dear God, accept our sacrifice.

01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:36.636
Amen!

01:59:37.236 --> 01:59:38.536
With the name of God.

01:59:46.903 --> 01:59:48.603
With the name of God.

01:59:54.703 --> 01:59:56.603
With the name of God.

02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:11.903
<i>God is the Greatest</i>

02:00:12.136 --> 02:00:14.536
<i>God is the Greatest</i>
 <i>God is the Greatest</i>

02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:19.236
<i>There is no deity</i>
 <i>worthy of worship but God</i>

02:00:19.803 --> 02:00:23.470
<i>God is the Greatest</i>
 <i>to God all praise is due.</i>

02:00:23.903 --> 02:00:27.536
<i>God is the Greatest</i>
 <i>God is the Greatest</i>

02:00:28.003 --> 02:00:32.836
<i>There is no deity</i>
 <i>worthy of worship but God</i>

02:00:33.136 --> 02:00:36.736
<i>God is the Greatest</i>
 <i>to God all praise is due.</i>

02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:40.903
<i>God is the Greatest</i>
 <i>God is the Greatest</i>

02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:45.970
<i>There is no deity</i>
 <i>worthy of worship but God</i>

02:00:46.503 --> 02:00:50.003
<i>God is the Greatest</i>
 <i>to God all praise is due.</i>

02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:53.836
With the help of God!

02:01:22.670 --> 02:01:24.036
Why did you do this?

02:01:24.936 --> 02:01:27.603
What changed your mind
and you opened the ironworks?

02:01:29.236 --> 02:01:31.636
Bey, whatever I did...

02:01:34.136 --> 02:01:35.903
...I did for Ertugrul Bey.

02:02:11.136 --> 02:02:13.236
Thank God, we handled this, as well.

02:02:14.003 --> 02:02:16.570
-You did well, Bey.
-Thank you, Kocabash.

02:02:17.903 --> 02:02:19.870
The poor will be happy at last.

02:02:28.503 --> 02:02:30.836
Every man has a different way
of handling the matters.

02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:32.536
This is mine.

02:02:33.570 --> 02:02:34.636
Do you know why?

02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:41.703
If people are always on war,
one day they get fed up.

02:02:45.070 --> 02:02:48.636
Tell me, what do Dodurga Alps
think about this?

02:02:51.003 --> 02:02:53.703
Our Beys reasoned out and
gave the right decision.

02:02:54.670 --> 02:02:56.236
No one has a doubt.

02:02:59.036 --> 02:03:01.170
But Ertugrul Bey...

02:03:02.703 --> 02:03:04.703
...and his Aips, Turgut and Dogan.

02:03:05.136 --> 02:03:06.236
What happened to them?

02:03:11.103 --> 02:03:12.770
Ertugrul Bey is a great Alp.

02:03:14.170 --> 02:03:17.036
Everyone knows his fame in Rumelia.

02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:21.136
But our Alps are anxious.

02:03:21.803 --> 02:03:22.970
Why are they anxious?

02:03:25.703 --> 02:03:28.870
They are anxious that he would cause
a discord within the Kayi Alps...

02:03:29.703 --> 02:03:32.203
...and that they would not obey
the orders in the battlefield.

02:03:32.836 --> 02:03:34.236
As it happened yesterday.

02:03:37.836 --> 02:03:38.870
Then, Ertugrul Bey...

02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:46.736
What? Tell me, what happened to Ertugrul?

02:03:47.036 --> 02:03:49.803
You have not heard it from me
but he is up to something.

02:03:50.503 --> 02:03:53.570
-What is he up to?
-With his Alps and Wild Demir.

02:03:55.870 --> 02:03:58.270
I saw him entering
Abdurrahman's tent yesterday.

02:03:59.470 --> 02:04:02.003
He sent everyone out while he was
talking to Abdurrahman.

02:04:02.836 --> 02:04:04.136
He mauled the guard as well.

02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:09.270
After he talked to Wild Demir, Wild Demir
got to work and flared up the furnace.

02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:14.836
I would like to be alone.

02:04:39.536 --> 02:04:41.603
Alps, come on, with the name of God.

02:05:18.736 --> 02:05:20.003
Where did Ertugrul go?

02:05:20.636 --> 02:05:22.536
He asked for Gundogdu and left.

02:05:27.536 --> 02:05:28.636
What happened, mother?

02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:33.536
I do not know, my daughter.

02:05:34.836 --> 02:05:36.736
I have a strange feeling.

02:05:39.670 --> 02:05:40.670
Anyway.

02:05:41.803 --> 02:05:44.236
-How is your work, my daughter?
-Thank God, it is good.

02:05:44.636 --> 02:05:46.936
We are trying to catch up with schedule.

02:05:48.103 --> 02:05:50.936
-If you want, I can show you the goods.
-I would love to.

02:05:56.536 --> 02:05:57.903
How are you with Aytolun?

02:05:59.170 --> 02:06:01.503
We are staying away
from each other, mother.

02:06:04.036 --> 02:06:05.170
Come on, sit down there.

02:06:06.570 --> 02:06:07.570
Girls!

02:06:08.670 --> 02:06:11.070
Bring the new drapes,
Mother Hayme wants to see them.

02:06:14.736 --> 02:06:15.736
Come on.

02:06:52.203 --> 02:06:53.736
What are you trying to do, Ertugrul?

02:06:54.070 --> 02:06:57.970
Do not say our tribe and future.
Talk openly. What is your problem?

02:06:58.536 --> 02:06:59.636
I want to talk you alone.

02:07:27.003 --> 02:07:29.503
Did the dog of Tugtekin
who tails me told you those?

02:07:30.103 --> 02:07:34.203
He tailed me all night and
talked to his owner then you, right?

02:07:34.803 --> 02:07:37.136
Yes. Do you know why?

02:07:38.070 --> 02:07:41.203
Because all the tribe is scared that
you are going to put us in danger!

02:07:42.136 --> 02:07:44.270
Your mother, brother, wife!

02:07:45.603 --> 02:07:48.103
Our tribe, my uncle's tribe
which we take shelter in!

02:07:50.170 --> 02:07:53.036
Noyan will not hibernate
all through winter, like you.

02:07:53.570 --> 02:07:55.803
He will not wait for
Ogeday's army, brother!

02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:59.070
There are thousands of Mongols
on the frontiers of Seljuk!

02:07:59.636 --> 02:08:02.270
What should we do?
Attack them with a handful of Alps?

02:08:03.570 --> 02:08:05.936
There are so many people
aiding and abetting Noyan...

02:08:06.070 --> 02:08:09.970
...and betraying to their people in
Seljuk lands that you would be surprised.

02:08:10.636 --> 02:08:14.036
They are all helping to Noyan.
We have to stop them!

02:08:15.003 --> 02:08:18.003
-So?
-We can make Noyan suffer!

02:08:18.170 --> 02:08:20.570
We can leave him breadless all winter!

02:08:20.903 --> 02:08:24.470
I saw how they live. If we cut the ways...

02:08:24.736 --> 02:08:25.870
Then what?

02:08:26.636 --> 02:08:28.470
They will attack the tribe again!

02:08:28.536 --> 02:08:29.903
They will ruin everything!

02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:32.770
Then we will suffer!

02:08:33.503 --> 02:08:35.503
We only have one shot.

02:08:36.070 --> 02:08:39.770
And we will use it all together
when Aleaddin's armies come!

02:08:40.570 --> 02:08:43.070
You must understand and see the truth!

02:08:43.670 --> 02:08:46.903
You will lose this war,
Tugtekin is just a boy!

02:08:47.236 --> 02:08:50.503
He is brave yet arrogant and weak!
Do not concede to him!

02:08:51.103 --> 02:08:53.636
Do not be with them
because you feel in debt...

02:08:53.703 --> 02:08:56.736
...taking shelter in my uncle's tribe,
like my mother!

02:08:56.903 --> 02:08:58.870
Open your eyes and look around!

02:09:00.070 --> 02:09:02.903
Two tribes are waiting like
sacrificial sheep!

02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:06.136
The butcher is coming!
He has spies everywhere!

02:09:08.170 --> 02:09:11.136
You have lost your mind.
That is not possible.

02:09:11.770 --> 02:09:12.803
It is possible.

02:09:13.236 --> 02:09:15.603
We can do this, believe me.

02:09:18.070 --> 02:09:19.070
How?

02:09:21.603 --> 02:09:22.970
Let us talk to our mother.

02:09:23.170 --> 02:09:25.636
She is old, now. You would be Bey.

02:09:26.770 --> 02:09:27.770
Be the Bey.

02:09:29.703 --> 02:09:31.203
We have to start this war.

02:09:33.170 --> 02:09:35.736
Only you can do this, not my mother.

02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:42.970
We cannot start resurrection of Kayis...

02:09:43.103 --> 02:09:45.470
...by taking shelter
in our uncle's tribe.

02:09:46.503 --> 02:09:48.536
You have the power to do this, brother.

02:09:50.703 --> 02:09:53.736
You have to put yourself together
and look around, brother.

02:09:55.670 --> 02:09:56.770
There is no war.

02:09:58.136 --> 02:09:59.503
There is no war!

02:10:00.236 --> 02:10:01.970
I do not want people to die.

02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:05.970
You are a coward, brother.

02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:08.070
A coward.

02:10:26.003 --> 02:10:28.070
Yes, I am a coward!

02:10:28.936 --> 02:10:32.203
I am a miserable man who accepts to be
a coward in order to...

02:10:32.636 --> 02:10:36.770
...protect the unity of our tribe
which was entrusted to us by our father!

02:10:37.736 --> 02:10:38.770
What about you?

02:10:39.803 --> 02:10:43.203
You are a devil who does not think about
the lives that would be lost!

02:10:46.203 --> 02:10:48.036
<i>The tribe is messed up.</i>

02:10:48.736 --> 02:10:50.703
<i>Sons of a Bey are</i>
 <i>fighting with each other.</i>

02:10:50.903 --> 02:10:55.770
<i>If I cannot save the Kayi tribe from you,</i>
 <i>let my life become hell.</i>

02:10:57.070 --> 02:10:59.803
Hit me, brother.
Hit me until you knock me out.

02:11:01.536 --> 02:11:05.736
If it would remind you who you are,
punch me until you knock me out.

02:11:27.636 --> 02:11:30.770
If it would remind you who you are,
where you came from...

02:11:31.603 --> 02:11:35.170
...and that you are Suleyman Shah's son,
take my life, brother.

02:11:44.136 --> 02:11:45.203
Do you remember, brother?
