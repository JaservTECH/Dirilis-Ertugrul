00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 37 will start after 11:58 min.

11:58.415 --> 12:02.081
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:03.653 --> 12:07.153
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:07.892 --> 12:10.792
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

12:26.754 --> 12:28.621
You are here just in time again
Ertugrul Bey.

12:29.721 --> 12:31.154
Thank God we met again.

12:33.911 --> 12:36.278
-Are you alright, Ertokus Bey?
-Of course!

12:36.878 --> 12:39.578
Noyan is more powerful than we thought.

12:40.844 --> 12:44.211
Our enemy should be powerful
for us to show our might.

12:45.311 --> 12:46.778
Alright, Ertugrul Bey.

12:48.744 --> 12:51.578
-They issued a death warrant for me.
-Why?

12:52.244 --> 12:53.844
I am accused of killing you.

12:55.878 --> 12:57.978
Me?

13:14.211 --> 13:15.611
Where did that arrow come from?

13:23.378 --> 13:24.711
There!

14:23.844 --> 14:26.311
Halime Sultan. Don't you understand?

14:27.078 --> 14:28.844
My brother's life depends on it.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.311
Tell me. Where is Ertugrul?

14:35.744 --> 14:38.744
Don't you know that I would never tell you
even if I knew it, Gundogdu Bey?

14:41.244 --> 14:44.878
Listen. If we cannot find him

14:45.278 --> 14:48.378
Gumustekin will find him sooner or later.

14:51.211 --> 14:55.644
After that point none of us can save
him from the gallows.

14:56.778 --> 14:59.744
Everybody think that
he is a killer and traitor.

15:09.211 --> 15:14.244
Halime. Tell us where Ertugrul is
before it is too late.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.044
It is not just about you.

15:17.378 --> 15:19.078
We all are in danger.

15:19.778 --> 15:22.811
And this will crush all of us.

15:26.744 --> 15:28.578
You will give him to Gumustekin,

15:28.744 --> 15:32.644
the dog of Sadettin Kobek, right?

15:34.644 --> 15:37.178
You cannot even deal with
Aytolun's tricks.

15:37.344 --> 15:39.678
How will you deal with
the palace's tricks?

15:44.678 --> 15:47.578
Can you not see the good intention of

15:47.744 --> 15:49.778
Gundogdu Bey, Korkut Bey and me, Halime?

15:52.211 --> 15:56.044
Tell us where he is while there is
still hope. Stop this nonsense!

15:56.611 --> 15:59.811
Ertugrul Bey would prefer to die
because of my nonsense

16:00.178 --> 16:02.611
rather than your good intention.

16:05.678 --> 16:08.678
-Gundogdu.
-Yes, mother?

16:10.844 --> 16:14.244
Gather all the Beys. Tell them to start
the preparations for tribe's migration.

16:15.944 --> 16:17.278
What are you saying, mother?

16:17.611 --> 16:20.344
Where does thiscome from?
Where could we go in this winter cold?

16:21.644 --> 16:24.111
They want to start a conflict between
my son and Sultan Alaeddin

16:24.178 --> 16:25.978
by smearing him.

16:26.378 --> 16:29.144
It would have been okay if Noyan
was the person behind this.

16:30.344 --> 16:35.044
But I know that Gumustekin is the one
who was fooled by this slander.

16:37.111 --> 16:41.244
It is my duty to respond him.

16:41.778 --> 16:44.711
-Mother.
-Gundogdu. Do as I say.

17:27.278 --> 17:29.778
Hang on, Ertokus Bey.
You will be fine.

17:30.011 --> 17:31.711
You will get better in the nomad tent.

17:31.878 --> 17:34.744
It is too late. Listen to me, Ertugrul.

17:35.211 --> 17:36.311
Listen to me.

17:37.711 --> 17:40.911
The information your
brother Sungurtekin sent...

17:42.078 --> 17:43.711
You must find it.

17:44.911 --> 17:48.378
You must give it to Sultan Alaeddin.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.178
That information...

17:52.344 --> 17:57.111
There is a big birdcage
where Mongols captured me.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.344
It is hidden in rock next that cage.

18:01.678 --> 18:04.078
Find it, Ertugrul. Find it.

18:05.611 --> 18:10.978
That information will also lead you
to your brother Sungurtekin.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.344
<i>I bear witness that</i>
 <i>there is no god but Allah,</i>

18:18.844 --> 18:21.078
<i>and I bear witness that Muhammad is the</i>

18:21.244 --> 18:23.311
<i>servant and Messenger of Allah.</i>

19:01.778 --> 19:02.944
Where are you, filth!

19:03.278 --> 19:04.678
-Where are you!
-This way.

20:48.678 --> 20:50.311
<i>My glorious Sultan.</i>

20:52.211 --> 20:54.278
<i>It is my first letter since years.</i>

21:02.811 --> 21:04.211
<i>I am writing this because...</i>

21:07.278 --> 21:10.144
<i>...my man Ertugrul is being slandered.</i>

21:23.844 --> 21:25.011
Mother Hayme.

21:25.678 --> 21:27.878
You must stop Halime and Ertugrul.

21:28.644 --> 21:31.844
The peace we would get with my
marriage will also be in jeopardy.

21:33.811 --> 21:35.644
As if we have any peace left.

21:40.278 --> 21:43.078
Mother Hayme. Halime must speak now.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.811
I think she knows where Ertugrul is.

21:49.078 --> 21:50.911
I know how to make her speak.

22:13.778 --> 22:15.044
What are you hiding?

22:17.911 --> 22:19.278
Nothing, mother.

22:21.111 --> 22:23.211
Do you think my eyes are blind?

22:24.311 --> 22:25.378
Tell me.

22:30.778 --> 22:31.978
Halime.

22:43.244 --> 22:45.878
I am writing our current situation
to Sultan Alaeddin, mother.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.178
Without my permission?

23:02.711 --> 23:05.744
Only Sultan's command
can save Ertugrul, mother.

23:08.278 --> 23:12.011
This will save us from the cruelty of
Aytolun and Gumustekin.

23:12.978 --> 23:15.778
And also from the attacks
of that greenhorn Tugtekin.

23:22.978 --> 23:26.744
Things will get ugly
if they hear about this.

23:30.644 --> 23:33.578
They will kill my Ertugrul
if we do not send a messenger, mother.

23:50.844 --> 23:54.778
<i>Well! Look at Halime Sultan!</i>

23:55.844 --> 23:58.578
<i>She is setting a trap to my man.</i>

24:41.011 --> 24:42.311
Gundogdu.

24:44.278 --> 24:47.978
The real gift is
to see what the eye does not see

24:48.777 --> 24:51.044
and hear what ear does not hear.

24:52.911 --> 24:55.044
What are you up to again?

24:56.978 --> 24:59.777
I see that you are walking into fire.

25:00.944 --> 25:04.311
I wanted to reach out for one last time.

25:06.311 --> 25:08.777
You should focus on your situation first.

25:09.378 --> 25:11.311
Put out the fire in your wicked heart.

25:14.244 --> 25:15.911
You have lost your mind.

25:24.578 --> 25:25.944
As you say.

25:31.911 --> 25:34.311
We would win the palace's favor
if we find Ertugrul first.

25:34.711 --> 25:37.144
So you send your Alps around here
to scout.

25:37.311 --> 25:39.578
We would keep a sharp lookout.
Do not worry, Bey.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.344
-Bey.
-Gokce.

25:49.578 --> 25:51.011
Let us talk privately, Bey.

25:54.011 --> 25:55.144
What's going on?

25:57.611 --> 26:00.844
-News from Ertugrul, Bey.
-What are you saying, my love?

26:02.078 --> 26:05.211
Halime reports your actions
to Sultan Alaeddin.

26:06.111 --> 26:07.711
Messenger will leave soon.

26:10.244 --> 26:12.378
Halime is just like his man then.

26:13.378 --> 26:14.878
What is she saying exactly?

26:40.844 --> 26:41.944
Amen.

26:46.611 --> 26:48.278
Rest in peace.

26:53.644 --> 26:55.911
Bey. How did Tangut find here?

26:59.811 --> 27:01.211
Abdurrahman...

27:01.611 --> 27:03.911
Maybe they tailed Abdurrahman, Bey?

27:05.378 --> 27:09.744
If they had tailed Abdurrahman,
Mongols would have never come here.

27:10.744 --> 27:13.044
They would not have given
Atabey Ertokus to us.

27:15.378 --> 27:17.378
Is there any chance that
they set up another ambush, Bey?

27:18.578 --> 27:22.944
I doubt it. If they had set up
an ambush, they would have come after me

27:23.111 --> 27:26.044
or you when you went after Tangut.

27:29.278 --> 27:31.011
If you ask me

27:31.178 --> 27:33.344
there is unrest among Noyan's army.

27:36.244 --> 27:38.611
Noyan may have no idea
about what Tangut did.

27:39.978 --> 27:41.278
So what will we do now, Bey?

27:41.611 --> 27:45.811
First we find the information
Atabey Ertokus said, then we decide.

27:49.678 --> 27:52.244
First of all we must find
that traitor in our nomad group.

27:53.278 --> 27:56.978
We can never find peace or move forward

27:58.011 --> 28:00.144
with this evil shadow looming over us.

28:01.744 --> 28:04.711
Atabey Ertokus was the only person
who could tell the truth

28:04.878 --> 28:07.011
to Sultan Alaeddin.

28:07.778 --> 28:09.811
His death could be a problem for us, Bey.

28:10.811 --> 28:14.144
Patience is the cure for every trouble,
brother Turgut.

28:16.944 --> 28:18.911
-As you say, Bey.
-As you say, Bey.

28:20.844 --> 28:24.811
My brave men! We have lived our lives
under the shadow of our swords

28:24.978 --> 28:26.644
to reach martyrdom.

28:28.044 --> 28:31.211
Come on then. It is time for batlle.

29:24.278 --> 29:28.211
I wonder how you enjoy
playing with these, brother.

29:30.044 --> 29:35.178
I cannot find peace if I do not clean
these rusty things, Aytolun.

29:36.978 --> 29:39.644
I give them the value they deserve.

29:40.078 --> 29:46.911
I polish what I like and darken
the shiny ones I do not like.

29:51.578 --> 29:53.944
What about your destiny, brother?

29:55.078 --> 29:57.711
Will it shine or darken?

30:03.211 --> 30:04.744
Good question.

30:06.044 --> 30:12.578
If Sultan Alaeddin accepts the offer
Sadettin Kobek made for me

30:13.111 --> 30:15.844
I will shine as the margrave of this land.

30:23.311 --> 30:26.011
You need to increase your power
in order to achieve that, brother.

30:28.044 --> 30:32.011
Your next target should be Noyan
after you capture Ertugrul.

30:33.111 --> 30:37.978
You must win one victory after another to
make people think you are the solution.

30:39.111 --> 30:41.978
We were unable to find
any trace of Ertugrul yet.

30:42.144 --> 30:44.144
What if you summon your
must trusted soldiers?

30:44.944 --> 30:47.244
I do not want to attract attention
in the palace.

30:48.111 --> 30:50.144
I ordered my trusted Alps to track him.

30:52.244 --> 30:55.911
We must make powerful Alps
in this nomad group to bow to you.

30:57.644 --> 30:59.778
We should make Gundogdu your son-in-law.

31:00.344 --> 31:02.278
I also pull the strings of Tugtekin.

31:10.344 --> 31:13.344
-Tugtekin? What is it?
-Halime Sultan is going to send

31:13.678 --> 31:15.944
a messenger to Alaeddin to inform on us.

31:23.844 --> 31:28.678
Son, you will be mute and
your eyes will be blind

31:28.844 --> 31:30.678
until you deliver this.

31:31.278 --> 31:34.311
Forfeit your life
before you hand this over.

31:35.111 --> 31:36.844
Fly like a hidden wind.

31:39.711 --> 31:41.578
Your command is my duty, Mother Hayme.

31:45.011 --> 31:46.344
Godspeed.

31:58.878 --> 32:02.578
So she hopes to get help
from Sultan Alaeddin.

32:03.111 --> 32:05.944
We cannot hold back our people
if that messenger

32:06.111 --> 32:09.078
leaves this nomad group to inform
Sultan Alaeddin.

32:09.878 --> 32:11.178
You must stop him.

32:11.378 --> 32:13.078
Let us say we stop it for now.

32:14.011 --> 32:17.744
Then what? It means Halime has been
seeing Ertugrul secretly.

32:18.778 --> 32:22.578
We must make Ertugrul's closest ones
in the tribe bow down to us.

32:22.744 --> 32:25.144
-Who else?
-Wild Demir.

32:26.244 --> 32:27.744
If things become complicated,
Gumustekin...

32:27.911 --> 32:29.744
We will take care of it before that.

32:30.744 --> 32:31.744
How so?

32:32.044 --> 32:34.944
Don't we want to lure Ertugrul
into a trap?

32:35.978 --> 32:37.078
Yes.

32:37.811 --> 32:42.811
So we put Wild Demir and
Halime into a cage.

32:44.944 --> 32:47.678
All hell would break loose
in the nomad group, brother.

32:47.844 --> 32:49.211
My father would never allow it.

32:52.044 --> 32:55.911
Your father left to check on our herds
in the outskirts.

33:02.078 --> 33:04.844
It is not about taking them prisoners.

33:05.578 --> 33:07.678
It is about showing Ertugrul

33:07.844 --> 33:10.711
what would happen to his loved ones
if he does not surrender.

33:12.578 --> 33:15.078
He is a murderer in the eyes of state.

33:16.644 --> 33:21.111
We need to occupy Hayme and Gundogdu
while they are being taken

33:21.278 --> 33:23.311
if we want to avoid causing trouble.

33:25.144 --> 33:29.278
Like I said, it is not about
taking them prisoner.

33:30.244 --> 33:32.778
It is about keeping them on edge.

33:33.244 --> 33:36.611
We must make them seem like
they are collaborating

33:36.778 --> 33:39.244
with a murderer who killed a statesman.

33:46.878 --> 33:50.944
I will occupy Hayme and Gundogdu
with Goncagul.

33:59.977 --> 34:01.977
What is this important matter, Artuk?

34:02.844 --> 34:06.077
Bey, I have served you for years.

34:06.977 --> 34:09.310
I think that I have done
nothing wrong against you.

34:10.044 --> 34:11.177
Alright.

34:13.777 --> 34:17.077
I know that what I am going to say
will not hurt you.

34:17.310 --> 34:21.044
My job is to telling the truth.

34:23.144 --> 34:25.877
Tell it, Artuk. What is it?

34:27.310 --> 34:30.510
I am saying that you have
abandoned Seigniory.

34:31.244 --> 34:33.910
They do not feel your power
in nomad group anymore.

34:34.077 --> 34:35.910
You do not have your old eyes.

34:36.110 --> 34:38.310
It seems that your word
has become obsolete.

34:38.944 --> 34:42.444
If that continues, you will not only
be able to merge with Kayi

34:42.777 --> 34:45.377
but also Dodurga nomad group
will fall apart.

34:47.410 --> 34:49.377
Why do you think like that, Artuk?

34:51.277 --> 34:56.744
Bey, Aytolun Hatun and Tugtekin
have a free hand in nomad tent.

34:57.744 --> 34:59.810
They have right to rule

34:59.977 --> 35:02.544
but they do not have any right
to be a Bey.

35:03.044 --> 35:06.810
If they talk on behalf of you

35:07.244 --> 35:10.844
neither their nor your rule
would have an influence.

35:12.210 --> 35:16.510
What I mean is you must take the law
in your own hands immediately.

35:16.844 --> 35:18.377
Immediately.

36:11.410 --> 36:13.877
Do not commit a murder, Kocabash.

36:14.944 --> 36:17.377
You do not worry.
I will do what is necessary, Bey.

36:55.410 --> 36:58.210
When you came to nomad tent
to meet Ertokus Bey

36:58.510 --> 37:01.144
that night Kocabash
stormed into our tent.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.844
He has said that he saw
an uncanny shadow in nomad tent.

37:05.277 --> 37:07.810
He supposedly came to our tent
to protect us.

37:08.744 --> 37:10.210
We thought it is apprehensive

37:10.377 --> 37:12.810
to be suspicious about Kocabash
until then but...

37:12.977 --> 37:15.144
We have also rescued him from Mongols.

37:17.010 --> 37:18.944
Is it possible that was him, Bey?

37:20.744 --> 37:25.010
If you are after a big hunt,
you sacrifice little preys.

37:27.377 --> 37:30.077
Maybe it was also a game
that you saved him.

37:40.544 --> 37:41.944
It must be around here, right, Bey?

37:42.377 --> 37:44.010
Yes, he was talking about here.

38:37.377 --> 38:40.377
We must give our lives to protect it.

39:03.310 --> 39:06.377
What do you mean I cannot find Tangut?
What do you mean I cannot find Tangut?

39:06.544 --> 39:08.444
Where the hell did he go?

39:10.310 --> 39:11.777
Find him!

39:19.044 --> 39:21.410
He may have ashamed of himself
because he couldn't catch

39:21.744 --> 39:24.510
a crippled man. He may have felt insulted.

39:26.544 --> 39:30.110
Tangut will make you pay a heavy price
for your words, Turk.

39:41.310 --> 39:44.977
Even death cannot take anyone's life
before get my permission.

39:45.144 --> 39:46.477
You should know this!

40:17.777 --> 40:18.877
Baycu Noyan.

40:19.310 --> 40:20.910
Efrasiyab "The Merchant".

40:22.010 --> 40:24.043
So you came back from nomad group.

40:24.210 --> 40:28.444
Tell us. Did execution order of Ertugrul
set Turks against each other?

40:28.777 --> 40:30.210
We are nearly there, sir.

40:30.377 --> 40:33.177
Gundogdu will have the final strike soon.

40:34.144 --> 40:39.310
Then maybe bravest warriors of world
will join your ranks.

40:39.477 --> 40:41.110
Like Abdurrahman.

40:42.377 --> 40:43.444
Like Hamza.

40:46.044 --> 40:48.010
Bring wine for me and Efrasiyab.

40:48.877 --> 40:50.377
We have a lot to talk.

40:54.177 --> 40:56.010
Find Tangut and bring him here.

41:14.210 --> 41:18.310
Our livestock would perish if we leave
immediately as Mother Hayme said.

41:19.744 --> 41:21.210
Do the necessary.

41:22.044 --> 41:25.477
I beg you, Bey. Do not force us
to migrate in the dead of winter.

41:26.077 --> 41:27.910
Our wounds are still open.

41:30.077 --> 41:33.144
You do not worry.
We will do what necessary.

41:33.310 --> 41:34.310
Okay.

41:49.544 --> 41:50.544
Migration?

41:52.844 --> 41:54.277
So you heard it.

41:56.277 --> 41:57.310
Bey...

41:59.010 --> 42:01.410
...I know that Mother Hayme is mad
at my father.

42:02.144 --> 42:05.477
And you have problems.
And you are right about it.

42:06.310 --> 42:10.010
You and your mother are carrying a
large basket of eggs on your back.

42:11.244 --> 42:15.977
However burden on my father's back
is completely different.

42:17.177 --> 42:21.344
My father is responsible for lives and
goods of not only Dodurgas and Kayis

42:21.510 --> 42:25.077
but also Bayats, Avsars, Karkins, Bey.

42:28.077 --> 42:31.010
While they are talking about
Ertugrul Bey has kidnapped

42:31.177 --> 42:34.110
the bravest commander of Seljuk
and killed his soldiers...

42:36.777 --> 42:39.077
...what could my father have done?

42:44.044 --> 42:47.810
I apologize, Bey. I have poured out
my heart to you suddenly.

42:48.910 --> 42:50.044
It is no problem.

42:50.977 --> 42:53.377
I was going to collect some herbs.

42:54.177 --> 42:56.810
I should get back to it. Excuse me.

42:56.977 --> 42:58.244
Of course.

43:00.744 --> 43:04.110
If you want to pour out someday
I am a good listener.

43:04.277 --> 43:05.377
You should know this.

43:06.877 --> 43:07.977
Alright.

43:47.344 --> 43:48.944
It is wonderful.

43:50.810 --> 43:54.110
Thank you very much, girls.
They are so beautiful.

43:55.310 --> 43:56.810
May it be easy, Hayme.

43:57.344 --> 43:58.344
Thank you.

44:00.210 --> 44:03.444
Daughter of the one of the women
is going to be a bride.

44:03.777 --> 44:06.844
She wants you to go to her tent
and pray for them.

44:07.844 --> 44:09.844
Let me check these first then we can go.

44:10.844 --> 44:13.544
-Why do not we go now?
-Why so rush?

44:14.944 --> 44:18.344
They will take her trousseau.
They are waiting for us.

44:20.777 --> 44:21.944
Let's go then.

44:24.944 --> 44:26.144
May it be easy.

45:31.944 --> 45:33.310
Listen, son.

45:34.144 --> 45:37.810
Community would fall apart on the day

45:38.410 --> 45:40.444
when they do not embrace
their brave one.

45:42.144 --> 45:47.810
Heads would be legs and legs would be
heads on the day when Beys

45:48.010 --> 45:51.810
do not embrace their brave ones.

45:53.277 --> 45:58.044
It is the day of devil that has no tongue
when those who see bad things

45:59.110 --> 46:03.177
but do not say anything and when
those who do not fight for justice.

46:08.977 --> 46:12.810
Yes, brave ones? What is it?

46:13.044 --> 46:17.144
You will come with us, Wild Demir.
Gumustekin Bey will interrogate you.

46:17.777 --> 46:21.377
-What interrogation?
-It is about helping murderer.

46:21.944 --> 46:23.810
Listen to me, son.

46:24.077 --> 46:27.510
Ertugrul Bey is the only alive son
that I have.

46:28.244 --> 46:32.044
You are talking about him
as if he is a brutal killer

46:32.210 --> 46:35.510
a traitor who betrayed his state.

46:35.944 --> 46:38.744
I am just an aide, Bey. Come with me.

46:59.910 --> 47:03.044
Turali. You wait here.

47:03.744 --> 47:06.244
Let's see what does this
uncanny Gumus want.

47:53.410 --> 47:57.777
Noyan. As if the ground swallowed him up.

47:58.877 --> 48:00.977
So he has more time to live.

48:05.744 --> 48:08.544
-What will we eat, Geyikli?
-I have made pastrami.

48:11.377 --> 48:14.777
Bamsi would have died for pastrami
if he was here.

48:17.410 --> 48:19.210
Especially Bamsi.

48:20.810 --> 48:23.944
Bey, I swear to God I have never
thought that I would miss a bear.

48:49.177 --> 48:50.277
Bey.

48:52.510 --> 48:54.010
Could you solve it?

48:56.410 --> 48:58.444
We must find someone
to read these immediately.

49:00.477 --> 49:04.477
As I understand, Ertokus Bey
has specified the roads

49:04.810 --> 49:08.444
that is going to be used before
the war against Mongols.

49:16.010 --> 49:19.344
-Peace be upon you, brave ones.
-And peace be upon you.

49:19.510 --> 49:21.544
And peace be upon you. Come please.

49:21.877 --> 49:23.477
Any room for me in your table?

49:23.810 --> 49:26.977
You are patron. We would not have table
without you. Come please.

49:32.110 --> 49:33.310
Come, Dogan.

49:38.310 --> 49:39.810
How did you find us?

49:40.877 --> 49:44.544
Heart's voice of brave ones can be
heard from anywhere, Turgut Alp.

49:46.110 --> 49:47.444
Thank you.

49:54.344 --> 49:56.310
-Please.
-Thank you.

50:35.744 --> 50:37.544
So you are Wild Demir!

50:40.144 --> 50:44.210
You are the famous blacksmith
who makes irons come around.

50:45.344 --> 50:47.910
Irons come around, Bey...

50:50.244 --> 50:55.044
...but those hearts which went blind
will not be in same line.

50:57.810 --> 51:00.977
Yes? What do you want from me?

51:01.944 --> 51:03.910
Answer to justice.

51:06.244 --> 51:07.944
Justice?

51:10.544 --> 51:12.277
To whose justice?

51:18.377 --> 51:20.544
Of course my justice!

51:23.377 --> 51:27.344
Fine. Ask me so I answer.

51:38.844 --> 51:42.977
Would you tell me Ertugrul's location
if I ask, Wild Demir?

51:47.744 --> 51:53.010
I see. Your justice seeks Ertugrul Bey.

51:56.277 --> 51:57.877
Listen, Bey.

51:59.244 --> 52:04.910
If Ertugrul Bey would have
betrayed to his state

52:05.344 --> 52:10.877
customs and marquee I would have
put his head on my anvil

52:11.044 --> 52:14.244
and crush it with my own hammer.

52:16.777 --> 52:19.144
I would not have cared.

52:22.244 --> 52:27.310
I'd not have consulted you

52:27.477 --> 52:32.210
or that worthless piece of order

52:34.110 --> 52:36.777
that I do not respect at all.

52:38.910 --> 52:41.144
Where is Ertugrul?

52:41.310 --> 52:44.344
Your son-in-law Turgut Alp
and the other one, Dogan Alp.

52:45.277 --> 52:50.444
12 traitors who fled from nomad group
and other Alps who joined them.

52:55.377 --> 52:58.544
How did you manage to train
all those many traitors?

52:58.877 --> 53:03.877
And you, Bey?
Which field's crop are you?

53:10.444 --> 53:13.410
I am a really patient man, Wild Demir.

53:15.944 --> 53:19.744
But patience and everything have an end.

53:22.877 --> 53:26.410
You will sing like a bird anyway.

53:28.544 --> 53:29.544
Okay?

54:18.110 --> 54:19.744
Are you looking for me, Bey?

54:45.210 --> 54:47.744
It seems you have problems as I do.

54:49.377 --> 54:51.410
What is your problem, Goncagul Hatun?

54:55.177 --> 54:57.010
My problem is my father, Bey.

55:00.410 --> 55:06.044
I know how he risks his life for this
nomad group, for our Sultan.

55:07.410 --> 55:10.044
I also know that how merciless
he is against people beside him

55:10.210 --> 55:12.110
for the things he believes in.

55:14.977 --> 55:16.977
Your father's duty is tough.

55:20.877 --> 55:22.410
It is not about it, Bey.

55:23.544 --> 55:24.877
What is it then?

55:27.044 --> 55:31.177
Sometimes he is merciless against
people beside him.

55:34.377 --> 55:36.010
Even against me.

55:40.210 --> 55:44.477
Forgive me, Bey. I went too far
and spoke too much.

55:45.177 --> 55:46.344
No worries.

55:49.510 --> 55:55.244
He offended you and Mother Hayme
because of your brother Ertugrul Bey.

55:57.444 --> 55:59.210
You forgive him, Bey.

56:01.077 --> 56:03.110
He is a good man, believe me.

56:04.010 --> 56:07.844
Everybody knows his respect and love
for your deceased father.

56:08.010 --> 56:10.777
-You also know it.
-Thank you very much.

56:20.410 --> 56:21.910
What is your problem?

56:28.344 --> 56:29.477
I went too far again.

56:32.277 --> 56:35.077
Who am I to ask your problem constantly?

56:35.777 --> 56:37.944
As if I can find a solution for it.

56:41.144 --> 56:42.310
What I can say is

56:42.477 --> 56:44.910
"May God does not give any problem
and make us look for solutions."

56:45.144 --> 56:47.410
No, Goncagul Hatun. No worries.

56:47.977 --> 56:51.277
There is no way to solve my problem
with conversation.

56:52.377 --> 56:53.944
You do not bother yourself.

56:55.944 --> 57:01.377
I do not know your problem but you
never know who has the solution, Bey.

57:05.544 --> 57:09.377
While life is so short, do not let
your problem become bigger inside you

57:09.544 --> 57:11.844
and do not let the destiny burn you.

57:16.477 --> 57:18.310
You have nice words.

57:55.910 --> 57:57.344
What is it? What do you want?

57:57.510 --> 57:59.377
You will come with us, Halime Sultan.

58:00.810 --> 58:02.244
It is Gumustekin Bey's order.

58:05.010 --> 58:06.010
Let's go.

58:54.044 --> 58:55.944
Wonderful.

58:58.010 --> 58:59.977
Welcome, Mother Hayme. It is an honour.

59:03.844 --> 59:05.310
You are so beautiful.

59:05.477 --> 59:07.444
May God bring you together
with your lover.

59:07.810 --> 59:10.244
May God make you live happily
ever after if God permits.

59:11.044 --> 59:12.110
Amen.

59:14.744 --> 59:15.777
Mother Hayme.

59:16.310 --> 59:18.144
-Mother Hayme.
-God damn it.

59:20.044 --> 59:22.144
-What is it, Dumrul?
-It is Gumustekin Bey.

59:22.310 --> 59:24.844
They took Wild Demir and Halime Sultan.

59:25.410 --> 59:26.944
What do you mean they took them?

59:30.477 --> 59:32.910
What is your brother up to?

59:33.077 --> 59:34.444
That is so impertinence.

59:34.777 --> 59:36.977
My brother does not do anything
without justice.

59:37.144 --> 59:39.544
Do not go crazy before learning the truth.

59:39.877 --> 59:41.944
I hope what you said is true.

59:42.110 --> 59:46.310
If not everyone and everything
in this nomad group shall fall apart.

59:47.144 --> 59:50.377
Dumrul. Tell Alps that
we are going to tent.

59:50.544 --> 59:51.544
Yes, mother.

01:00:16.177 --> 01:00:17.410
Stop!

01:00:19.144 --> 01:00:20.310
Let her go!

01:00:25.077 --> 01:00:26.910
Let Halime Sultan go.

01:00:29.244 --> 01:00:31.077
I said let her go!

01:00:33.844 --> 01:00:36.444
It is Gumustekin Bey's order.
We cannot let her go.

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:46.377
I said let her go!

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:51.144
Or my sword will drink
your blood like sherbet.

01:01:06.377 --> 01:01:08.110
What is going on, Hayme Hatun?

01:01:08.277 --> 01:01:10.510
Do you rebel against your state
like your son?

01:01:12.377 --> 01:01:16.210
Rebelling against cruels
is in our blood, Gumustekin.

01:01:17.044 --> 01:01:20.944
And making traitors kneel down
is in our blood, Hayme Hatun.

01:01:21.977 --> 01:01:23.310
What is happening here?

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:45.044
Put down your swords.

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:48.010
Put them down!

01:01:48.344 --> 01:01:49.510
Put them down!

01:01:51.344 --> 01:01:55.377
Do not you ever think the results of
drawing swords to each other?

01:01:57.044 --> 01:01:58.344
Put them down!

01:02:11.177 --> 01:02:14.177
Hayme. What is going on here?

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:18.977
Gumustekin put Wild Demir into cage tent.

01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:21.177
And I guess that was not enough

01:02:21.344 --> 01:02:23.510
so he wants to put my daughter-in-law
Halime Sultan, too.

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:26.010
What does it mean, Gumustekin?

01:02:58.444 --> 01:03:01.110
Every one of them is really
important information, Ertugrul.

01:03:01.877 --> 01:03:03.310
What is it about?

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:08.844
Ertokus Bey kept tally of these lands.

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:11.377
"Which tribe has how many Alps?"

01:03:11.844 --> 01:03:14.044
"Which tribe is ruled by who?"

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:17.510
"How many soldiers will be given
for war against Mongols?"

01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:23.444
And he specified a route for
marching of Center Army.

01:03:29.777 --> 01:03:32.177
Any news about my brother Sungurtekin?

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:40.810
Yes.

01:03:42.244 --> 01:03:46.310
He wants to kill Ogeday and
want to rejoin you in a short while.

01:03:48.477 --> 01:03:50.310
If God permits we come together again.

01:03:50.544 --> 01:03:52.477
If God permits, son. If God permits.

01:03:58.844 --> 01:04:00.144
What is your intention?

01:04:01.444 --> 01:04:05.310
Everything we do is meaningless until
we find the traitor in nomad group.

01:04:05.944 --> 01:04:09.077
I will go to nomad group
and take action tonight.

01:04:26.344 --> 01:04:27.444
Thank God!

01:04:31.844 --> 01:04:35.410
Ertugrul. There is not much time
to expected dawn.

01:04:37.777 --> 01:04:39.810
There is not much time to resurrection.

01:04:43.877 --> 01:04:47.877
Dark nights will be over
and world will have peace.

01:04:53.344 --> 01:04:55.144
Be patient a little more.

01:04:55.344 --> 01:04:57.244
Try hard a little more, son.

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:04.544
What did we say? Destiny loves endeavor.

01:05:25.977 --> 01:05:27.344
Alps dismissed.

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:32.877
Go!

01:05:41.944 --> 01:05:43.910
What is it, Gumustekin?

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:52.177
You are punishing others in nomad group
without my permission.

01:05:53.044 --> 01:05:55.210
Why are you so nervous, Korkut Bey?

01:05:55.377 --> 01:05:58.977
When did Gumustekin do something
injustice so you are roaring at me?

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:05.144
What crime did Hayme Hatun's
daughter-in-law Halime Sultan commit

01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:07.943
so she was captured
in her own nomad group?

01:06:08.377 --> 01:06:10.877
I would not care about my father

01:06:11.044 --> 01:06:13.210
if my father acts as an accomplice
with murderer of statesmen.

01:06:13.377 --> 01:06:15.877
Halime Sultan sees Ertugrul secretly.

01:06:21.443 --> 01:06:26.077
Even it was, you cannot take anyone
without my permission.

01:06:42.477 --> 01:06:43.777
Alright!

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:49.077
If Sultan Aladdin asks why did
you slip murderer through your fingers

01:06:50.044 --> 01:06:53.110
I would say that Korkut Bey
did not give permission.

01:06:58.277 --> 01:07:01.910
Gumustekin. I understand your anger.

01:07:02.544 --> 01:07:04.544
Too many brave soldiers have died.

01:07:04.877 --> 01:07:07.877
One of the most favorite commanders
of Sultan has been kidnapped.

01:07:08.277 --> 01:07:10.777
However we need proof.

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:21.110
Halime Sultan and Hayme Hatun

01:07:21.277 --> 01:07:23.477
is doing something
behind your back, too.

01:07:23.844 --> 01:07:26.744
They have complaint about you and me
to Sultan Aladdin.

01:07:28.977 --> 01:07:31.810
Their intention is to make him
meet with Ertugrul.

01:07:32.844 --> 01:07:34.844
It means they know his location.

01:07:37.144 --> 01:07:39.077
Right, Hayme Hatun?

01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:46.110
Is he telling the truth, Hayme?

01:07:47.777 --> 01:07:51.910
Since he is so sure he must prove it.

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:03.544
If I prove it...

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:08.944
...will you give Halime Sultan
and Ertugrul with your own hand?

01:08:19.844 --> 01:08:21.077
I will.

01:08:29.144 --> 01:08:35.910
But now you will release Wild Demir
and my daughter-in-law Halime.

01:08:55.744 --> 01:08:57.910
As you wish, Hayme Hatun.

01:09:28.444 --> 01:09:30.744
You are free. Gumustekin Bey
said you can go.

01:09:31.444 --> 01:09:33.310
But you do not leave nomad group.

01:09:39.477 --> 01:09:44.077
Your only intention is turning
nomad group into hell then.

01:09:47.444 --> 01:09:48.877
My God!

01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:53.010
Save us from this fire

01:09:53.177 --> 01:09:57.944
as you have saved Abraham
from Nemrut.

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:21.010
Coward! He is still defending his niece
after everything I have done for him.

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:24.410
He is allied with Hayme. I told you so.

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:26.944
He is too weak against Ertugrul.

01:10:28.477 --> 01:10:30.477
He may be afraid of him.

01:10:33.277 --> 01:10:36.110
No matter what we must finish it.

01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:37.977
Korkut...

01:10:40.844 --> 01:10:42.477
...must die on short notice.

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.177
What? Are you afraid?

01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:54.944
-No.
-What then?

01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:01.510
We must bond two nomad groups
very tightly

01:11:02.277 --> 01:11:04.477
so we would not fall apart
when Korkut died.

01:11:11.444 --> 01:11:13.010
What are you thinking?

01:11:14.277 --> 01:11:17.044
There is not much time for
Gokce and Tugtekin's wedding.

01:11:17.944 --> 01:11:20.044
We may have a double wedding.

01:11:22.744 --> 01:11:25.044
Then nobody can stand in front of us.

01:11:28.177 --> 01:11:31.277
What if Korkut continues
to be a trouble for us?

01:11:32.944 --> 01:11:34.277
I would not allow it.

01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:41.877
He would not be
a trouble any longer...

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:46.044
...if I make him worse than dying.

01:11:47.144 --> 01:11:50.244
How can you be so sure
about trusting Gokce?

01:11:56.510 --> 01:12:01.010
She wants to use Tugtekin in order
to take love revenge on Ertugrul.

01:12:04.444 --> 01:12:06.810
She is in love with Ertugrul then?

01:12:12.777 --> 01:12:15.844
And where is Goncagul?

01:12:16.344 --> 01:12:19.177
She is busy with stealing
Gundogdu's heart.

01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:32.977
Bey.

01:12:36.877 --> 01:12:39.544
-What is it, Dumrul?
-Wild Demir and Halime Sultan.

01:12:40.477 --> 01:12:42.044
What about them?

01:12:44.477 --> 01:12:46.344
It is Gumustekin, Bey.

01:12:46.544 --> 01:12:49.377
He tried to take them into cage
to interrogate them.

01:13:16.778 --> 01:13:18.578
Let me go!

01:13:26.612 --> 01:13:27.778
Let me go!

01:13:38.545 --> 01:13:41.012
Here I come!

01:13:48.645 --> 01:13:51.445
In the name of God!

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:19.412
God damn it!
Noyan will lose his mind.

01:15:30.345 --> 01:15:31.745
Bamsi! Brother!

01:15:31.812 --> 01:15:33.445
-Brother!
-Is it you?

01:15:34.812 --> 01:15:38.112
It is me, brother. It is me.

01:15:43.178 --> 01:15:44.245
Brother, what is it?

01:15:44.312 --> 01:15:47.812
I cannot tell you . Mother Hayme gave it
to me. I am taking it to Konya.

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:52.178
Brother, it is obvious that Mongols
set an ambush for you.

01:15:52.312 --> 01:15:54.112
They will not let you go.

01:15:54.312 --> 01:15:58.312
Come back to the nomad tent with me.
Talk to Mother Hayme first and go.

01:15:58.478 --> 01:16:00.045
What do you think, brother?

01:16:01.578 --> 01:16:03.178
I say aye.

01:16:03.278 --> 01:16:05.278
My mighty brother!

01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:17.445
These Mongols are fierce fighters,
brother.

01:16:17.712 --> 01:16:21.312
They never end no matter
how much you kill.

01:16:23.578 --> 01:16:26.445
How is my nomad group, brother?
Are they okay?

01:16:29.045 --> 01:16:30.412
Why is that, brother?

01:16:31.312 --> 01:16:33.612
Ertugrul Bey is exiled.

01:16:38.645 --> 01:16:40.112
Ertugrul Bey?

01:16:41.678 --> 01:16:43.745
Who exiled Ertugrul Bey, brother?

01:16:46.012 --> 01:16:47.478
I will tell it on the way.

01:16:50.712 --> 01:16:55.112
Tell me, brother.
Tell me about Ertugrul Bey, brother.

01:17:03.712 --> 01:17:06.312
Your father has ruined our plans.

01:17:06.712 --> 01:17:07.778
It is better this way.

01:17:09.112 --> 01:17:11.778
When Kocabash finds the information
that messenger has

01:17:12.445 --> 01:17:15.145
Mother Hayme will hand over Ertugrul
with her own hands.

01:17:15.245 --> 01:17:19.712
Son, let's say we have dealt with
this situation, then what?

01:17:21.612 --> 01:17:23.012
What do you mean?

01:17:23.312 --> 01:17:25.778
Your father would not take action, son.

01:17:26.412 --> 01:17:29.378
If a Bey would not take action
in a nomad group

01:17:29.445 --> 01:17:31.612
there will not be any peace
in that nomad group.

01:17:31.745 --> 01:17:34.645
We have not seen any comfort
since the Kayis arrived here.

01:17:35.178 --> 01:17:37.045
Are they the only ones to blame?

01:17:37.812 --> 01:17:40.578
Your father is guilty as much as they are.

01:17:42.645 --> 01:17:44.745
Let me tell you son,

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:50.245
if this continues like that your father
will lose his Seigniory.

01:17:51.812 --> 01:17:54.445
You must stake a claim on Seigniory.

01:18:18.312 --> 01:18:21.212
What if they take it from the messenger?
What would we do then, mother?

01:18:22.178 --> 01:18:24.445
We must be prepared for everything.

01:18:30.178 --> 01:18:31.445
Wild Demir.

01:18:31.645 --> 01:18:34.045
Can we take Halime out of nomad group?

01:18:39.212 --> 01:18:41.445
It is too hard, Mother Hayme. Really hard.

01:18:41.812 --> 01:18:44.612
They don't let anyone
out of the nomad group.

01:18:54.178 --> 01:18:55.478
Mother.

01:18:57.012 --> 01:18:58.678
What does everyone say?

01:19:01.712 --> 01:19:05.312
I disappear for a little while
and look what happens.

01:19:05.578 --> 01:19:07.678
It is really dangerous, son.

01:19:09.312 --> 01:19:12.512
If they catch the messenger,
our relationship will be torned apart.

01:19:14.178 --> 01:19:15.478
What messenger, mother?

01:19:17.812 --> 01:19:20.345
Messenger we sent to Sultan Aleaddin.

01:19:24.478 --> 01:19:26.512
God have mercy on us.

01:19:27.445 --> 01:19:30.578
I wish you had shared these clever
plans of yours.

01:19:33.445 --> 01:19:35.245
I sent it to my uncle.

01:19:37.078 --> 01:19:40.078
You would know about it
if you were around, Gundogdu Bey.

01:19:42.112 --> 01:19:43.612
No, Halime Hatun. No.

01:19:44.345 --> 01:19:48.145
It is obvious that you want to
act like a sultan in this marquee.

01:19:48.412 --> 01:19:52.378
As long as you keep acting like a sultan,
you will torment our tribe.

01:19:52.712 --> 01:19:56.678
We want to learn my brother's location
from you but you keeep bringing us

01:19:56.745 --> 01:19:58.278
more troubles.

01:20:02.245 --> 01:20:03.645
What now?

01:20:11.445 --> 01:20:13.778
How did they find out about
this messenger?

01:20:19.412 --> 01:20:22.212
<i>Only Sultan's order can save Ertugrul.</i>

01:20:22.278 --> 01:20:24.812
<i>If anybody hears it,</i>
 <i>things will get out of hand.</i>

01:20:35.278 --> 01:20:40.645
My God, protect our messenger.

01:20:40.712 --> 01:20:42.012
Amen.

01:20:51.445 --> 01:20:54.278
Peace be upon you.

01:20:54.345 --> 01:20:55.778
-Bamsi.
-Bamsi.

01:20:56.612 --> 01:20:58.545
And peace be upon you.

01:21:01.745 --> 01:21:03.278
Mother Hayme.

01:21:04.578 --> 01:21:06.212
Thank God you are here.

01:21:06.712 --> 01:21:09.112
-Master!
-Welcome, son.

01:21:12.412 --> 01:21:13.778
Bey!

01:21:15.278 --> 01:21:17.378
-Welcome.
-Greetings.

01:21:17.445 --> 01:21:19.012
Sister Halime.

01:21:19.078 --> 01:21:20.445
Welcome, Bamsi.

01:21:20.778 --> 01:21:22.745
Where have you been, you lunatic?

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:25.412
I battling in the mountains, master.

01:21:28.412 --> 01:21:30.812
Mother Hayme. Dundar is fine.

01:21:31.578 --> 01:21:33.245
Yigit Alp is fine.

01:21:33.578 --> 01:21:35.245
They are being disciplined.

01:21:35.345 --> 01:21:37.412
They are all like lions.

01:21:40.212 --> 01:21:44.245
Mother Hayme, I have brought Gunkut, too.

01:21:46.078 --> 01:21:47.478
Gunkut!

01:21:49.412 --> 01:21:51.312
Brother Gunkut!

01:21:55.445 --> 01:21:56.678
Gunkut!

01:21:58.578 --> 01:22:01.478
-What is going on?
-Mongols have attacked me, Mother Hayme.

01:22:02.545 --> 01:22:04.812
I would have died,
if it was not for Bamsi.

01:22:09.078 --> 01:22:11.512
They knew that I was the messenger.

01:22:15.412 --> 01:22:17.612
We were lucky again.

01:22:20.212 --> 01:22:23.712
Bamsi, I will talk to you later.

01:22:23.778 --> 01:22:25.078
Alright.

01:22:25.578 --> 01:22:29.145
Excuse me, I leave the decision making
to you.

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:34.078
As long as I don't learn them
from others.

01:22:39.512 --> 01:22:41.345
I missed you, son.

01:23:02.678 --> 01:23:04.578
My men are looking for him everywhere.

01:23:06.445 --> 01:23:08.678
He cannot run forever.

01:23:09.078 --> 01:23:11.045
He will show up sooner or later.

01:23:11.412 --> 01:23:12.612
Bey!

01:23:14.245 --> 01:23:16.378
It is like ground has swallowed
that messenger.

01:23:16.545 --> 01:23:18.245
There are no trace of him.

01:23:18.445 --> 01:23:20.778
Incompetent fool! Keep looking.

01:23:28.678 --> 01:23:30.078
What now?

01:23:30.345 --> 01:23:31.512
Relax.

01:23:32.145 --> 01:23:36.012
My spies in the palace will deliver
another letter to Aleaddin

01:23:36.145 --> 01:23:38.445
on behalf of Halime Sultan.

01:23:40.045 --> 01:23:41.645
You scare me, Bey.

01:23:44.678 --> 01:23:48.245
How are things in the palace?
Sultan Aleaddin? Sadettin Kopek?

01:23:50.545 --> 01:23:54.578
Sultan Aladdin is the most gifted Sultan
I have ever seen.

01:23:55.045 --> 01:23:59.412
And Sadettin Kobek is the most evil
vizier I have ever seen.

01:24:00.445 --> 01:24:02.678
So the devil and the angel
are in the same palace?

01:24:03.278 --> 01:24:06.345
I am also curious about the end of
this story.

01:24:07.078 --> 01:24:13.778
But the real question is Tugtekin,
where will we end up in this story?

01:24:16.745 --> 01:24:18.112
What do you think?

01:24:18.545 --> 01:24:20.278
Right in the center of it.

01:24:20.712 --> 01:24:25.145
I mean we must be the ones
who decide the end of this story.

01:25:25.678 --> 01:25:28.578
Did Abdurrahman enter the nest of Noyan?

01:25:29.578 --> 01:25:33.545
He did but I don't know
how will he get out.

01:25:34.678 --> 01:25:36.145
I hope for the best.

01:25:36.545 --> 01:25:42.545
We must think about saving Ertugrul Bey
from all this trouble.

01:25:46.312 --> 01:25:52.712
One day the hand of God will touch it
and everything will go upside down.

01:25:53.312 --> 01:25:56.812
That hand should reach out soon.

01:25:59.045 --> 01:26:01.678
It is not the right time then.

01:26:05.412 --> 01:26:07.478
Bey! Welcome.

01:26:08.212 --> 01:26:09.478
Greetings.

01:26:10.778 --> 01:26:13.645
Artuk Bey, you have done a lot for us.

01:26:13.712 --> 01:26:15.812
Do not mention it, Bey. My pleasure.

01:26:16.378 --> 01:26:22.078
As long as you seek justice,
there will always be someone

01:26:22.145 --> 01:26:25.545
to help you and clear your path.

01:26:28.178 --> 01:26:29.445
Thank you!

01:26:30.612 --> 01:26:33.178
We don't have much time.
We must act quickly.

01:26:35.312 --> 01:26:36.478
Peace be upon you.

01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:40.678
-Bey!
-My Bamsi!

01:26:40.812 --> 01:26:43.112
Bey, they told me you were on exile!

01:26:43.178 --> 01:26:44.545
Bey!

01:26:45.545 --> 01:26:47.178
Bey!

01:26:47.245 --> 01:26:48.745
Bey!

01:26:51.812 --> 01:26:54.678
They can exile us,
but we can come back from the sky, Bamsi.

01:26:54.745 --> 01:26:57.578
I would die for you, Bey!
I would die for you!

01:27:00.778 --> 01:27:02.478
Come, brother.

01:27:09.712 --> 01:27:11.112
Bey!

01:27:11.712 --> 01:27:13.345
Bey, your hand?

01:27:15.445 --> 01:27:19.678
-This is just a mosquito bite, Bamsi.
-Bey, I would--

01:27:20.045 --> 01:27:21.812
I would crush that mosquito, Bey.

01:27:22.345 --> 01:27:23.545
Do not worry.

01:27:24.512 --> 01:27:26.478
You fell in the middle of action,
Bamsi Beyrek.

01:27:26.545 --> 01:27:28.112
Really, Bey?

01:27:29.045 --> 01:27:30.045
Nice.

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:34.045
It has been a long time
since I decapitated some heathens.

01:27:34.412 --> 01:27:36.012
I was drowning in sorrow, Bey.

01:27:44.578 --> 01:27:46.745
We should tell Halime Sultan
that I am here.

01:27:47.545 --> 01:27:49.145
I will take care of it.

01:27:49.378 --> 01:27:52.078
-Excuse me.
-Thank you very much.

01:27:52.378 --> 01:27:54.745
Do not stand up, please.

01:28:02.645 --> 01:28:08.145
Master Demir, you know that
I am not good with words.

01:28:08.745 --> 01:28:10.611
My condolences, master.

01:28:11.145 --> 01:28:12.745
Our heart burns.

01:28:13.778 --> 01:28:15.278
Thank you.

01:28:36.478 --> 01:28:39.578
I want to hold you in my arms soon,
my child.

01:28:48.212 --> 01:28:49.678
Why are you in a rush, Turali?

01:28:51.345 --> 01:28:53.678
Ertugrul Bey wants to see you,
Halime Sultan.

01:29:17.112 --> 01:29:19.245
I don't believe that
Ertugrul is a murderer

01:29:19.412 --> 01:29:25.745
or he betrayed his state, Aytolun.

01:29:27.045 --> 01:29:30.412
Then Ertugrul should come here to
face the trail himself, Bey.

01:29:30.512 --> 01:29:33.445
And let the ones behind this plot
be revealed one by one.

01:29:34.512 --> 01:29:36.712
Gumustekin is more than a brother to me.

01:29:37.445 --> 01:29:39.745
I am breathing because of him.

01:29:40.812 --> 01:29:44.678
He saved my life from the Mongols
with his sword without flinching.

01:29:45.278 --> 01:29:47.712
His leg was crippled because of that.

01:29:47.778 --> 01:29:51.445
However he is on a wrong path.

01:29:53.278 --> 01:29:55.345
He is looking for the evil
in a wrong place.

01:29:56.545 --> 01:30:01.745
Bey, you used to trust my brother's
intuition and experience a lot.

01:30:03.645 --> 01:30:05.145
I did.

01:30:06.112 --> 01:30:07.578
I always did.

01:30:09.645 --> 01:30:11.412
But not this time.

01:30:13.578 --> 01:30:18.212
His search for this evil
is giving birth to more evil among us.

01:30:48.112 --> 01:30:50.012
Get ready, Halime Sultan.

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:52.212
We will go to Konya.

01:30:54.678 --> 01:30:56.278
We?

01:30:59.812 --> 01:31:02.678
Since our messenger was not able
to reach Konya

01:31:03.078 --> 01:31:05.045
then we go there ourselves.

01:31:10.612 --> 01:31:13.012
How is that going to happen, Bey?

01:31:17.712 --> 01:31:22.178
By asking help from the traitor itself
to take us to Konya.

01:31:54.345 --> 01:31:57.245
<i>Gundogdu.</i>

01:31:59.178 --> 01:32:01.345
<i>Our tribe is getting restless.</i>

01:32:02.078 --> 01:32:05.012
<i>Decisions are being made</i>
 <i>in your marquee without you.</i>

01:32:05.178 --> 01:32:07.512
<i>Your Hatun burns down the nomad group.</i>

01:32:08.345 --> 01:32:10.612
<i>And what are you doing, Gundogdu?</i>

01:32:12.178 --> 01:32:14.478
<i>Pull yourself together quickly!</i>

01:32:16.378 --> 01:32:18.512
<i>Gundogdu who is the son of Suleyman Shah.</i>

01:32:19.045 --> 01:32:24.078
<i>Shape up or ship out.</i>

01:32:35.412 --> 01:32:36.812
Permission.

01:32:40.112 --> 01:32:41.245
Peace be upon you.

01:32:41.345 --> 01:32:43.145
And peace be upon you.

01:32:45.012 --> 01:32:46.078
Yes, Master?

01:32:46.145 --> 01:32:48.578
I have hot soup. Warm yourself.

01:32:50.078 --> 01:32:51.678
Thank you, brother.

01:32:54.678 --> 01:32:58.378
I want to talk to you
about something important.

01:32:58.578 --> 01:33:02.278
I know that this will stay between us.

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:08.445
Turgut and Dogan used to hate you at first

01:33:09.512 --> 01:33:14.578
but then you have proved your bravery
to all of us. Thank you.

01:33:15.445 --> 01:33:17.012
Thank you, Master Demir.

01:33:18.278 --> 01:33:24.778
I need your help to clear our names.

01:33:26.478 --> 01:33:29.212
Turgut and Dogan have saved my life.

01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:33.045
They are my brothers in this world and
the other.

01:33:35.578 --> 01:33:37.812
I will do whatever you want, Wild Demir.

01:33:38.578 --> 01:33:40.312
Thank you.

01:33:41.545 --> 01:33:45.245
We must set off with Halime
before sunrise.

01:33:47.012 --> 01:33:51.812
But we need get out of
the nomad group quietly.

01:33:52.512 --> 01:33:56.178
The guardian Alps report to you.

01:33:57.412 --> 01:33:59.078
What about Ertugrul Bey?

01:33:59.145 --> 01:34:00.712
Will you meet him?

01:34:02.745 --> 01:34:04.078
Yes.

01:34:06.178 --> 01:34:07.545
Do not worry.

01:34:08.278 --> 01:34:10.478
I will do my best, Master Demir.

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:14.045
Anything for you to clear your names.

01:34:14.345 --> 01:34:16.112
Thank you.

01:34:36.378 --> 01:34:39.778
So it is my turn to go and
leave you alone.

01:34:40.612 --> 01:34:42.245
Godspeed.

01:34:43.378 --> 01:34:45.312
May the sun never burn your skin.

01:34:46.212 --> 01:34:48.212
May no rain make you cold.

01:34:48.678 --> 01:34:50.545
May no stone get in your way.

01:34:51.612 --> 01:34:55.078
Come back to your tribe
like a flowing river.

01:35:11.212 --> 01:35:14.278
I want you to tell something to my mother
before you go, Halime Sultan.

01:36:14.778 --> 01:36:16.778
<i>Konya is too far, girl.</i>

01:36:18.045 --> 01:36:20.212
You will ride a horse for days.

01:36:21.078 --> 01:36:22.612
And you are pregnant.

01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:29.812
We also know what happened to that Alp
who I sent to Konya.

01:36:30.112 --> 01:36:33.578
Ertugrul will come with us until we leave
dangerous lands, mother.

01:36:35.378 --> 01:36:36.812
<i>And if my baby is to become</i>

01:36:37.045 --> 01:36:40.678
a brave Alp like his father,
he must get used to challenging roads.

01:36:43.678 --> 01:36:45.512
May God protect you.

01:36:49.012 --> 01:36:51.478
Godspeed, my child.

01:36:55.578 --> 01:36:58.178
I will ask you something, Halime.

01:37:03.078 --> 01:37:05.612
Is Ertugrul still upset with me?

01:37:06.412 --> 01:37:08.312
No, he is not upset, mother.

01:37:09.012 --> 01:37:10.645
He misses you a lot.

01:37:11.245 --> 01:37:14.578
He wants to kiss your hand and
embrace you as soon as possible.

01:37:16.145 --> 01:37:18.078
I also feel suffocated.

01:37:19.345 --> 01:37:22.612
May God never separate a mother
from her child.

01:37:23.378 --> 01:37:24.645
Amen.

01:37:28.045 --> 01:37:31.112
May the God protect you on your journey.

01:37:34.212 --> 01:37:35.412
Mother.

01:37:38.212 --> 01:37:41.212
Ertugrul Bey wanted me to give you
another news.

01:37:42.778 --> 01:37:44.445
Another secret?

01:37:45.112 --> 01:37:46.578
Another secret, mother.

01:37:47.612 --> 01:37:50.078
What is it this time?

01:37:54.678 --> 01:37:56.678
Sungurtekin.

01:38:02.145 --> 01:38:05.212
Ertugrul Bey has learned that his brother
is alive.

01:38:15.378 --> 01:38:17.012
How?

01:38:17.678 --> 01:38:19.378
How can he know that?

01:38:19.645 --> 01:38:21.245
"My mother has been patient
for a long time.

01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:23.612
Tell her to be patient
without asking questions."

01:38:23.745 --> 01:38:27.078
He will bring his brother
to the nomad group soon, mother.

01:38:41.478 --> 01:38:42.578
My son!

01:38:45.512 --> 01:38:47.145
My son!

01:38:48.378 --> 01:38:55.345
My God, you made me hear this news,
so please allow me to see my child's face.

01:38:56.512 --> 01:39:00.445
Let us be reunited, merciful God.

01:39:01.678 --> 01:39:03.178
Amen.

01:39:03.578 --> 01:39:05.645
My son!

01:39:16.612 --> 01:39:18.112
Gokce.

01:39:19.112 --> 01:39:20.778
I have learned his location.

01:39:22.212 --> 01:39:23.512
Ertugrul's location.

01:39:24.545 --> 01:39:27.612
Tugtekin, go and bring him here alive.

01:39:30.145 --> 01:39:32.445
Bring him, so that he gets
what he deserves.

01:39:56.078 --> 01:39:57.445
Brother.

01:39:58.345 --> 01:40:01.612
I think you should talk to Hayme
before things get more complicated.

01:40:02.712 --> 01:40:07.612
First we have asked Gokce, who he sees
as her daughter, for our son Tugtekin.

01:40:08.112 --> 01:40:12.078
Now we want her son Ertugrul to send
to the gallows.

01:40:13.312 --> 01:40:19.245
I think it is better to make Mother Hayme
happy, until we get rid of Korkut.

01:40:25.578 --> 01:40:27.445
Do I have permission, Bey?

01:40:28.078 --> 01:40:29.712
Enter.

01:40:33.578 --> 01:40:35.245
Gumustekin Bey.

01:40:38.245 --> 01:40:40.145
We need to talk right away.

01:40:42.378 --> 01:40:44.678
Excuse us.

01:40:56.345 --> 01:40:57.745
What is it, son?

01:40:58.245 --> 01:41:00.245
I have learned Ertugrul's location.

01:41:03.212 --> 01:41:04.278
Where is he?

01:41:04.345 --> 01:41:06.512
He will meet with his wife
and Wild Demir tomorrow.

01:41:06.778 --> 01:41:09.612
It seems that he wants to
bring the message himself

01:41:10.512 --> 01:41:13.045
after their messenger to Sultan
was intercepted.

01:41:13.345 --> 01:41:15.212
You did not tell it to your father, right?

01:41:15.278 --> 01:41:16.578
No, he does not know it.

01:41:17.412 --> 01:41:20.212
You know that your father
is really sensitive about his nephew.

01:41:21.512 --> 01:41:23.112
I will take care of it myself, Bey.

01:41:23.578 --> 01:41:25.445
That is the best way.

01:41:25.678 --> 01:41:27.812
Go and take care of it yourself.

01:41:28.612 --> 01:41:30.178
Do I have permission?

01:41:30.245 --> 01:41:31.512
Yes.

01:41:35.478 --> 01:41:37.345
You summoned me, Bey.

01:41:38.778 --> 01:41:41.612
Gather our men.
We will set off before sunrise tomorrow.

01:41:42.345 --> 01:41:44.378
I have learned Ertugrul's location.

01:42:14.112 --> 01:42:16.078
I have news for Noyan.

01:42:59.045 --> 01:43:00.678
So you are back.

01:43:18.678 --> 01:43:20.212
Where were you, Tangut?

01:43:39.645 --> 01:43:41.212
Where were you?

01:43:46.812 --> 01:43:48.712
I want to talk privately.

01:43:49.512 --> 01:43:53.412
What are you hiding from the men
I entrust my life?

01:43:55.445 --> 01:43:58.245
I want to talk privately, Baycu Noyan.

01:44:34.178 --> 01:44:35.678
Speak.

01:44:36.812 --> 01:44:40.012
Ertokus. He's dead.

01:44:44.212 --> 01:44:46.078
How?

01:45:07.645 --> 01:45:10.145
Go away! Get lost!

01:45:24.012 --> 01:45:27.445
Good job. Keep going like this.

01:46:13.545 --> 01:46:16.445
-Aytolun Hatun!
-Move.

01:46:18.112 --> 01:46:19.212
Move!

01:46:35.412 --> 01:46:37.045
What are you doing here?

01:46:37.112 --> 01:46:40.278
I have remembered
how generous of a woman you are.

01:46:43.745 --> 01:46:47.078
You old hag!
I told you not to come here again.

01:46:47.445 --> 01:46:51.078
Winter is ahead.
I am an old and lonely woman.

01:46:51.145 --> 01:46:53.645
I need a place to stay
and something to eat.

01:46:53.712 --> 01:46:56.178
You cannot stay in this nomad group.
Get out of here!

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:00.612
Wolfs would eat my body before
winter ends.

01:47:01.312 --> 01:47:04.278
Maybe this is what you really want, eh?

01:47:05.245 --> 01:47:07.412
Tell me is that what you want?

01:47:09.712 --> 01:47:11.778
Wait me at that foothill.

01:47:12.012 --> 01:47:14.478
I will bring the things you want tonight.

01:47:14.545 --> 01:47:16.678
Thank you, Aytolun Hatun.

01:47:17.045 --> 01:47:18.512
This will be the last time you see me.

01:47:18.712 --> 01:47:21.145
I am so sick to survive this winter.

01:47:22.578 --> 01:47:26.545
If you come here again I will not
let you die of sickness.

01:47:27.012 --> 01:47:30.712
I will feed you to the wolves
with my own hands! Go now!

01:47:59.278 --> 01:48:02.178
Aunt. Are you okay?

01:48:03.045 --> 01:48:06.045
That old hag was here.

01:48:08.745 --> 01:48:12.078
I told you that
she was not going to leave you alone.

01:48:16.178 --> 01:48:17.545
Don't you worry, aunt.

01:48:18.678 --> 01:48:20.512
I will take care of her.

01:48:22.212 --> 01:48:26.778
I will whisper in her ear that
she should never bother you again.

01:48:31.812 --> 01:48:33.745
I went for hunting in the woods.

01:48:34.712 --> 01:48:37.578
I saw some tracks, trailed them
and found myself in some place.

01:48:37.645 --> 01:48:39.012
Cut to the chase!

01:48:39.445 --> 01:48:41.278
The tracks belonged to Kayis.

01:48:42.612 --> 01:48:46.045
I traced them in hopes of
catching some of them.

01:48:46.812 --> 01:48:51.112
Then I saw the Kayis attacking our
soldiers who were escorting Ertokus.

01:48:55.178 --> 01:48:57.178
What are you saying, Tangut?

01:48:58.412 --> 01:49:02.012
I killed Ertokus to prevent them from
recapturing him.

01:49:15.812 --> 01:49:18.345
Man who I have been trying
to catch for years

01:49:18.745 --> 01:49:21.278
have died before I delivered him to
Ogeday.

01:49:26.512 --> 01:49:27.712
Get lost.

01:49:28.378 --> 01:49:30.078
Get lost!

01:49:41.612 --> 01:49:44.145
After I am done with you Ertugrul,

01:49:46.445 --> 01:49:48.345
your world will be in ruins.

01:50:07.145 --> 01:50:10.212
What is it, Tangut? What's going on?

01:50:16.178 --> 01:50:17.712
<i>May God help you.</i>

01:50:18.078 --> 01:50:20.712
<i>As I said, Noyan will take prisoners away</i>
 <i>in the morning.</i>

01:50:21.512 --> 01:50:25.645
<i>Every news you bring from that</i>
 <i>bastard Noyan, will lead us to salvation.</i>

01:50:30.645 --> 01:50:32.278
<i>May God protect you.</i>

01:50:46.745 --> 01:50:50.045
<i>Prepare the horses. Let's go.</i>

01:50:51.145 --> 01:50:52.578
<i>Yes, Bey!</i>

01:50:55.112 --> 01:50:58.278
<i>May the scourge of the earth and sky,</i>
 <i>follow you wherever you go.</i>

01:51:01.045 --> 01:51:03.345
<i>You are done now!</i>

01:51:03.812 --> 01:51:06.378
Noyan has lost one of his favorite man.

01:51:08.778 --> 01:51:10.578
That is why he is angry.

01:51:40.445 --> 01:51:41.712
Who are you?

01:51:42.145 --> 01:51:45.245
Suleyman Shah's daughter, Selcan.

01:51:46.812 --> 01:51:48.278
I used to know your father.

01:51:49.045 --> 01:51:50.712
I mean your birth father.

01:51:51.578 --> 01:51:54.545
That evil man who made brothers
kill each other.

01:51:57.512 --> 01:52:01.312
I have heard that you are no different
than your father.

01:52:01.612 --> 01:52:06.278
However an elder Dervish who came from
the west had tamed you.

01:52:07.312 --> 01:52:08.745
You have repented.

01:52:09.145 --> 01:52:12.778
Your old ears are not that deaf if seems.

01:52:13.078 --> 01:52:15.645
I hear everything. I mean everything.

01:52:16.012 --> 01:52:19.512
Now get out of here! Leave me alone.

01:52:29.712 --> 01:52:31.612
What do you want from me?

01:52:32.478 --> 01:52:33.745
Aytolun.

01:52:34.445 --> 01:52:37.145
Why did she grow pale when she saw you?

01:52:39.578 --> 01:52:41.812
Everything has a price, girl.

01:52:57.578 --> 01:53:01.812
Price of the information you want to know
is not this worthless necklace.

01:53:03.378 --> 01:53:05.178
I am not afraid to pay the price.

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:10.045
Then you hate Aytolun Hatun that much.

01:53:11.145 --> 01:53:14.278
She is a miserable person,
not even worth my hate.

01:53:16.512 --> 01:53:19.478
Tell me. What do you know?

01:53:20.345 --> 01:53:22.612
Why is she so afraid of you?

01:53:23.312 --> 01:53:28.278
She was warming the bed of Korkut Bey
long before his wife died.

01:53:29.678 --> 01:53:34.245
Do we need to talk about this
wretched woman any longer?

01:53:34.378 --> 01:53:35.545
Yes.

01:53:35.645 --> 01:53:37.545
Then you must pay the price.

01:53:37.678 --> 01:53:41.112
Pay it before nightfall to get
what you want.

01:53:41.712 --> 01:53:44.678
You wait here. I will be back with gold.

01:53:45.212 --> 01:53:47.745
Do not move away from this place!

01:53:48.178 --> 01:53:52.012
Where can I go except hell?

01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:13.645
It's you!

01:54:14.645 --> 01:54:16.678
-What have you told her?
-Nothing.

01:54:16.778 --> 01:54:18.812
-What have you told her?
-Nothing.

01:54:23.245 --> 01:54:26.045
What is this? What is this then?

01:54:28.445 --> 01:54:29.812
I have not said anything.

01:54:43.278 --> 01:54:46.345
You got what you deserved, old hag.

01:55:09.443 --> 01:55:11.776
Why did you send Alps without
letting me know, mother?

01:55:18.176 --> 01:55:20.343
Mother. Tell me.

01:55:21.110 --> 01:55:23.043
Don't you trust me anymore?

01:55:24.143 --> 01:55:25.443
Why?

01:55:26.010 --> 01:55:28.510
Is it because I did not stand
up against you like Ertugrul?

01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:33.310
Is it because I did not place more
burden on your shoulders like him?

01:55:34.710 --> 01:55:36.843
It is because I placed
your burden on my shoulder?

01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:40.710
-Tell me.
-Enough. That is enough.

01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:45.743
I have thought that it would be
better if less people knew about it.

01:55:45.810 --> 01:55:47.810
There is nothing to
feel upset about it.

01:55:48.243 --> 01:55:49.843
How is this possible mother ?

01:55:51.376 --> 01:55:53.443
You sent a brave one to death alone.

01:55:53.743 --> 01:55:55.876
And you did it without telling me.

01:55:56.943 --> 01:56:01.310
Do you trust Ertugrul who always causes
problems in nomad group more than...

01:56:01.376 --> 01:56:02.810
...your step son?

01:56:03.276 --> 01:56:04.776
Gundogdu.

01:56:12.110 --> 01:56:15.010
Gundogdu! Son!

01:56:38.476 --> 01:56:40.376
Where is she!

01:56:43.876 --> 01:56:47.176
Women make homes,
right, Aytolun Hatun?

01:56:47.843 --> 01:56:50.210
We have learned that
you destroyed it.

01:56:51.343 --> 01:56:53.510
Let's hope for the
best for all of us.

01:57:51.243 --> 01:57:54.010
Mother Hayme, Gumustekin Bey
wants to see you.

01:57:58.476 --> 01:58:00.143
Let him come in.

01:58:19.776 --> 01:58:22.876
Yes, Gumustekin? What is it?

01:58:23.776 --> 01:58:26.910
Are you here to interrogate me?

01:58:31.376 --> 01:58:34.343
I have acted impulsively
against you, Hayme Hatun.

01:58:35.276 --> 01:58:39.210
When Sadettin Kobek gave me the
order about Ertugrul, and also...

01:58:39.976 --> 01:58:44.276
...hearing words of that soldier who
escaped from war has made me blind.

01:58:45.110 --> 01:58:49.510
All my life I have been in war against
Genghis Khan and Ogeday after he died,...

01:58:49.876 --> 01:58:53.010
...and his ignoble sons now.

01:58:54.143 --> 01:58:57.010
I maybe tired. I am sick of it.

01:58:58.210 --> 01:59:03.176
However when I heard that I got another
stroke from Suleyman Shah's son...

01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:07.443
...I was grieved by
that, Hayme Hatun.

01:59:08.843 --> 01:59:12.710
Forgive me if I crossed the line
and broke your heart yesterday.

01:59:21.876 --> 01:59:28.810
I know you and the importance of the
duty which Sultan Aleaddin entitled you.

01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:35.510
My son will prove
that he is innocent.

01:59:37.243 --> 01:59:41.476
If Ertugrul does not surrender,
state would not pardon him...

01:59:41.710 --> 01:59:43.343
...even if I pardon him, Hayme Hatun.

01:59:45.276 --> 01:59:49.710
And you should know that there
is nothing I can do from now on.

01:59:57.143 --> 02:00:01.343
Mother Hayme. They found a body
of an old woman near nomad tents.

02:02:20.443 --> 02:02:22.143
Selcan!

02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:26.510
Neither Wild Demir nor Halime
Sultan, Bey. None of them is here.

02:04:27.276 --> 02:04:28.943
Have you checked everywhere?

02:04:29.010 --> 02:04:30.776
We have, Bey.

02:04:32.443 --> 02:04:34.243
Keep searching.

02:04:41.976 --> 02:04:43.843
Aytolun!

02:04:45.810 --> 02:04:48.776
You killed her! You are
a murderer! Murderer!

02:04:49.076 --> 02:04:53.043
Let me go! I am telling you, she is a
murderer. She killed that woman. Murderer!

02:04:53.410 --> 02:04:55.843
I said she killed
that woman. Let me go!

02:04:56.010 --> 02:04:58.043
You killed her. Killed her!

02:06:49.930 --> 02:06:51.963
You were not expecting
me, right, my aunt's son?

02:06:52.563 --> 02:06:54.163
Welcome, Tugtekin.

02:06:55.263 --> 02:06:57.530
So you want to witness a festivity?
