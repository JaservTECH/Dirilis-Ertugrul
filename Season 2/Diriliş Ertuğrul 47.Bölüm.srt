00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 47 will start after 12:24 min.

12:24.367 --> 12:28.367
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:29.511 --> 12:33.178
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:33.823 --> 12:36.823
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:13.386 --> 13:14.452
Kill this Turk!

13:54.485 --> 13:55.919
Were you saying something, commander?

14:07.852 --> 14:09.386
If you take one more step, I will kill
the girl.

14:09.819 --> 14:12.819
Take me! My daughter!
Please let my daughter go!

14:13.219 --> 14:14.319
Leave your sword.

14:15.919 --> 14:16.952
I said throw it!

14:24.919 --> 14:26.352
Now we will go away from here
with the girl.

14:27.086 --> 14:29.552
You should know that the girl will die
If you come after us.

14:31.086 --> 14:33.452
Let her go and take me! My daughter!

14:36.852 --> 14:38.152
Let my daughter go, I am begging you!

14:38.452 --> 14:39.519
<i>Take me!</i>

14:41.219 --> 14:42.286
Move!

14:43.086 --> 14:44.519
Do not come, or else she will die!

14:51.519 --> 14:52.519
<i>Take me!</i>

14:56.586 --> 14:57.819
<i>My daughter!</i>

15:09.886 --> 15:13.152
It is written in the letter that they made
peace and you hid it from us.

15:14.519 --> 15:16.419
This is an opportunity to save Noyan.

15:17.852 --> 15:21.152
If they do not give him even in the name
of peace, go and battle with them.

15:21.952 --> 15:24.152
Save Noyan from those Turks, Tangut!

15:25.552 --> 15:29.452
Ertugrul was brave enough to save
Abdurrahman.

15:30.586 --> 15:32.052
Noyan will die.

15:32.919 --> 15:34.919
He will pay the price for his foolishness!

15:35.952 --> 15:38.419
You better accept it. Noyan is dead!

15:39.052 --> 15:42.952
Your are not following the way
of holly spirits, Tangut.

15:43.919 --> 15:47.586
The way you took, already awaken
all those underground spirits.

15:48.919 --> 15:51.786
First, the voice of death will come.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.919
Then death itself.

15:55.286 --> 15:56.452
Enough.

15:57.152 --> 15:58.852
Enough, shut up!

16:07.052 --> 16:08.152
Listen to me carefully.

16:10.319 --> 16:15.952
In China, I went to war with Genghis Khan
against Ziya Dynasty.

16:18.419 --> 16:19.952
Genghis Khan was sick.

16:20.852 --> 16:22.219
He was about to die.

16:23.219 --> 16:25.486
He hid his sickness from everyone.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.119
He risked himself to death for victory.

16:28.919 --> 16:30.086
And he died.

16:30.586 --> 16:34.319
What falls to our share is an honorable
death just like Genghis Khan himself.

16:36.219 --> 16:37.386
Noyan will also die.

16:38.886 --> 16:40.052
He will die honoredly.

16:41.319 --> 16:43.286
He will pay the price for his mistake.

16:48.986 --> 16:52.452
Valiant Alps of Kayi and Dodurga.
Their virtuous people!

16:58.552 --> 17:02.452
Peace be with you!

17:02.919 --> 17:05.019
-And peace be with you!
-And peace be with you.

17:05.886 --> 17:09.586
Dear Khan, Sadettin Kobek,
you honored our nomad group.

17:12.186 --> 17:15.019
We made Noyan; the archenemy of our
Sultan and our state,

17:16.119 --> 17:18.986
bend on his knees in front of us.

17:21.919 --> 17:26.786
You honored us while we were about to make
this blood shedder murderer pay for...

17:27.252 --> 17:30.019
...what he has done. Welcome.

17:30.586 --> 17:32.852
Thank you, Hayme Hatun.

17:35.152 --> 17:39.419
I am very glad to be here,
in front of you.

17:46.152 --> 17:49.119
When I heard that you captured
this dishonest man...

17:51.419 --> 17:52.786
...I praised God.

17:54.819 --> 18:00.052
This struggle you are going through
between these vast mountains...

18:01.052 --> 18:02.986
...is worthy of admiration.

18:05.419 --> 18:10.119
I want to present my gratitude
to all those valiants who captured him.

18:15.252 --> 18:19.886
In the name of our Sultan Alaeddin
Keykubat, I order you to

18:22.519 --> 18:23.586
stop the execution.

18:25.252 --> 18:27.152
We want Noyan's head!

18:28.819 --> 18:31.119
We want Noyan's head!
-We want his head!

18:31.286 --> 18:33.952
-Kill him!
-Nobody can take him from us!

18:34.286 --> 18:36.019
Kill him! Kill him!

18:36.586 --> 18:38.852
Kill him! Kill him!

18:39.252 --> 18:41.786
-We want justice!
-Kill him!

18:48.019 --> 18:49.319
We want justice!

18:52.786 --> 18:53.919
Kill him!

18:55.352 --> 18:57.119
Kill him! Kill him!

18:58.186 --> 18:59.952
Kill him! Kill him!

19:01.052 --> 19:03.186
Kill him! Kill him!

19:04.886 --> 19:06.552
We announced peace with

19:09.452 --> 19:11.252
Ulu Khan Ogeday.

19:16.286 --> 19:21.252
This bloody war we fought
for years is finally over.

19:25.286 --> 19:28.886
From now on, no more Seljukian
and Mongolian blood will be spilled!

19:32.186 --> 19:33.452
Khan Highness!

19:34.552 --> 19:36.486
If you let me, I have a question.

19:41.119 --> 19:42.786
What is the cost of this peace?

19:47.952 --> 19:52.152
I know well how you defeated the vanguards
of this dishonest man...

19:52.352 --> 19:54.219
with your brother, Ertugrul.

19:57.052 --> 19:59.919
I have endless respect for your bravery.

20:02.286 --> 20:03.519
You asked me abour the cost!

20:08.152 --> 20:09.252
The cost of this peace

20:12.352 --> 20:14.252
is paid with the blood of our martyrs.

20:17.152 --> 20:21.852
Prisoners of both sides will be replaced
and peace will be provided.

20:26.119 --> 20:28.252
Noyan also takes place within
these prisoners...

20:29.886 --> 20:31.086
...who are going to be replaced.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.286
We want his head! We want Noyan's head!

20:49.486 --> 20:51.886
Kill him! Kill him!

21:06.514 --> 21:07.547
Commander.

21:08.414 --> 21:10.114
Those are men of that Turk.

21:12.614 --> 21:14.214
Do not approach, if not, girl dies!

21:21.314 --> 21:24.214
Dear God, you give plenty at one time.

21:39.747 --> 21:41.214
Kill them all!

21:58.081 --> 22:00.647
Kill them all! All of them!

22:24.347 --> 22:26.214
Halime, daughter...

22:27.747 --> 22:29.214
...I say it as last time.

22:30.281 --> 22:31.281
You came to my marquee.

22:32.314 --> 22:33.481
I understand it.

22:35.381 --> 22:37.381
You are from ancestry of Seljukian.

22:38.214 --> 22:40.081
Bride of Suleyman Shah.

22:40.347 --> 22:45.547
But how did you enter to my intimate,
tell me?

22:53.447 --> 22:56.714
I came to talk with Aytolun Hatun, Bey.
This is the reason why I am here.

22:59.647 --> 23:00.647
Bey.

23:07.081 --> 23:10.414
Sadettin Kobek came to nomad tent
with his soldiers, Bey.

23:12.081 --> 23:13.214
What?

23:15.314 --> 23:17.547
Halime Sultan. Rest for a while.

23:19.281 --> 23:21.814
Aytolun Hatun will come and see you soon.

23:25.847 --> 23:30.381
Banu Cicek, look after Halime Sultan.

23:39.414 --> 23:41.681
Leave marquee of Bey right now!

23:42.481 --> 23:44.081
Why did you help me?

23:45.814 --> 23:48.881
Halime Sultan, I show respect to you.

23:49.347 --> 23:50.881
Do not make me lost it.

23:51.681 --> 23:52.747
Go away.

23:53.581 --> 23:56.147
I had to lie Bey, all because of you!

23:56.481 --> 23:57.514
Why?

23:58.881 --> 24:00.847
Why you lied to Bey because of me?

24:07.214 --> 24:09.581
What is the thing you know and
not sharing, Banu Cicek?

24:11.214 --> 24:12.814
I said go Halime Sultan!

24:14.181 --> 24:16.181
Go, if not things will come to a bad end
for you!

24:34.147 --> 24:37.414
Now, Noyan is gone!

24:38.347 --> 24:39.514
There is only victory!

24:40.414 --> 24:43.514
There is your brother Tangut will take you
to victory!

24:45.314 --> 24:47.881
Is there anyone makes an objection...

24:49.447 --> 24:52.181
...to things I say, if there is
show yourself up like a man!

25:11.314 --> 25:13.747
Kill him!

25:19.314 --> 25:21.414
Kill him!

25:21.714 --> 25:23.714
Give his head to us! Kill him!

25:23.847 --> 25:26.347
Kill him!

25:26.581 --> 25:28.081
Give his head to us!

25:32.314 --> 25:33.681
Beys!

25:35.347 --> 25:36.847
People of Kayi, Dodurga.

25:40.614 --> 25:45.181
Thanks to God, we made peace between
two states.

25:46.814 --> 25:48.447
Today is such a holly day!

25:49.281 --> 25:51.747
But Ameer Excellency...

25:53.514 --> 25:58.247
...we know that exchange of prisoners
are made between honorable...

25:58.314 --> 25:59.481
...soldiers and valiants.

26:01.381 --> 26:03.714
But this Mongolian cur...

26:05.147 --> 26:10.347
...is a murderer, killed our brothers,
mothers and sisters!

26:11.447 --> 26:14.747
His punishment will be conducted
right now in this pitch!

26:15.181 --> 26:20.781
Live long Bey!

26:20.847 --> 26:26.181
Live long Bey!

26:26.247 --> 26:31.447
Live long Bey!

26:31.681 --> 26:34.114
Live long Bey!

26:34.347 --> 26:36.614
Our Sultan Aleaddin Keykubat...

26:38.114 --> 26:40.814
...always thinks that
mutinous of Turkmen Tribe comes...

26:41.214 --> 26:46.681
...from their nature,
as their valiantness.

26:51.447 --> 26:53.247
He plugged his ears to statesmen and...

26:54.181 --> 26:58.447
...people that complains of
migrant families...

26:59.281 --> 27:03.414
...accompanies brother and
he always stand...

27:03.481 --> 27:05.147
...ancestry of Oghuz family.

27:07.414 --> 27:12.081
Be sure that I know this ignoble and
his numbers better than you do.

27:14.247 --> 27:16.281
How cruel he is and...

27:16.847 --> 27:20.547
...how he murdered many
women and children.

27:23.414 --> 27:29.381
But know it, we need peace
so that ignoble people...

27:30.081 --> 27:34.847
...like him will not come again
to lands of our state.

27:37.781 --> 27:42.481
We need to exchange him with three
of our precious commanders.

27:45.514 --> 27:49.514
For this dishonest that is not be
a patch of one of our commanders...

27:50.181 --> 27:56.547
...I cannot let anyone to reject
peace strictly.

27:57.481 --> 28:01.547
We want justice!

28:01.614 --> 28:05.847
We want justice!

28:06.081 --> 28:10.547
We want justice!

28:10.614 --> 28:15.647
We want justice!

28:15.714 --> 28:17.381
-We want justice!
-Bey.

28:17.781 --> 28:19.514
Do not you see?

28:20.247 --> 28:21.681
We cannot give Noyan to you.

28:22.581 --> 28:28.181
We want justice!

28:28.381 --> 28:30.547
We want justice!

28:30.614 --> 28:34.181
Dear Ameer, Sadettin Kobek.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.081
Korkut Bey.

28:37.647 --> 28:38.747
Hayme Hatun.

28:48.647 --> 28:50.647
Noyan took too many lives from us.

28:51.814 --> 28:57.147
But talking about this matter
in front of angry Alps,...

28:57.714 --> 29:02.814
...furious people is not right.

29:06.514 --> 29:10.881
I have always trusted to your mind and
common sense, Korkut Bey.

29:13.414 --> 29:15.081
So, stop the execution.

29:17.347 --> 29:20.281
Discuss this matter in a calm environment.

30:37.314 --> 30:39.247
Sister, stand up sister, are you alright?

30:40.381 --> 30:42.414
Get up sister, get up.

30:43.281 --> 30:44.614
Because of peace condition...

30:44.881 --> 30:49.581
...I have to give Noyan and take
my prisoner commanders, Korkut Bey.

30:56.147 --> 30:57.547
Unlike, more valiant will be...

30:58.214 --> 31:01.681
...murdered and destroyed.

31:04.747 --> 31:09.247
Peace will be a dream in these lands.

31:10.281 --> 31:12.547
We will think about this matter out.

31:12.614 --> 31:15.214
What will you think out, Korkut Bey?

31:15.547 --> 31:18.581
This murdered will not get out
of my nomad group freely.

31:18.681 --> 31:20.114
We will not let it happen.

31:20.181 --> 31:22.881
Will we revolt against the state
we fight for?

31:24.347 --> 31:30.581
Hayme, we should discuss on this matter
in your marquee.

31:33.681 --> 31:35.481
I will accommodate with...

31:35.647 --> 31:37.447
...my soldiers in caravansary.

31:38.581 --> 31:40.747
I will wait for your propitious news.

31:47.347 --> 31:49.581
If God permits, you will be...

31:50.081 --> 31:52.214
...in the side of peace and mind.

32:09.747 --> 32:10.747
Gundogdu Bey.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.714
Take this ignoble to trussed tent.

32:16.747 --> 32:21.114
We want justice!

32:21.381 --> 32:25.247
We want justice! Kill him!

33:03.214 --> 33:05.314
What did I tell you, smart boy?

33:07.314 --> 33:11.314
Did I tell you, you are unable
to kill me or not?

33:18.314 --> 33:20.481
Your corpse will leave from this
nomad tent, Noyan.

33:20.547 --> 33:26.881
You so furious boy, you are so colt...

33:27.547 --> 33:29.514
...and fool.

33:32.747 --> 33:36.481
Kill him! We want justice!

33:41.181 --> 33:43.847
-Kill him!
-We want justice!

33:51.647 --> 33:53.281
Noyan knows about us.

33:54.481 --> 33:56.181
Everything about us.

33:56.547 --> 34:00.114
More he breathes, more danger will be
our intention of taking margrave...

34:00.181 --> 34:03.481
...that we've been working for years.
-Noyan is not a risk for anyone.

34:04.514 --> 34:08.747
I will not jump on a risky path.
Do not you still understand it?

34:09.314 --> 34:10.881
Do not forget about your duty.

34:11.247 --> 34:12.847
Do what is necessary for peace.

34:13.081 --> 34:16.114
Salve trouble of people so that...

34:17.347 --> 34:19.547
...I can take Noyan and leave.

34:19.747 --> 34:22.814
I will be waiting for you in
caravansary at night.

34:24.081 --> 34:25.647
Bring the seal with you when you come.

34:33.781 --> 34:36.781
Do not tell me that you have not taken
the seal from Sungurtekin.

34:39.647 --> 34:41.581
I will come to caravansary at night.

35:45.414 --> 35:48.647
The reason of vulgar expression
on your face was this, right.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.114
-What are you trying to say, Sungur?

35:55.814 --> 35:59.214
Did not you understand why he was so sure
that he will not die, brother?

36:02.314 --> 36:04.114
He knew about peace.

36:04.847 --> 36:06.314
Smart boy.

36:08.114 --> 36:09.814
Even if you knew about peace and...

36:10.714 --> 36:14.647
...Ameer Excellency Sadettin Kobek
would come here...

36:15.881 --> 36:17.581
...you kidnapped my wife.

36:18.114 --> 36:19.614
You set me up.

36:20.614 --> 36:22.514
Such a damn man you are!

36:24.547 --> 36:26.381
If you think by hiding behind of peace...

36:26.814 --> 36:30.181
...you can save your people,
you are wrong.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.347
My battle just began.

36:37.281 --> 36:38.381
Sungur!

36:48.114 --> 36:50.281
Wait outside, brother.

37:13.881 --> 37:17.581
Ameer Sadettin Kobek waits for you
in caravansary, Sungutekin Bey.

37:23.481 --> 37:26.581
Souls always support the strong one,
smart boy.

37:27.181 --> 37:28.881
Peace is for cowards.

37:30.447 --> 37:34.614
The one who settles peace lose courage
and spirit.

37:37.081 --> 37:38.314
Peace is...

37:38.681 --> 37:41.181
... a game to cheat weak ones.

37:43.381 --> 37:44.881
Eventually, one day it will be over.

37:45.814 --> 37:48.547
You will find me standing
against you then.

37:50.181 --> 37:53.547
I will do everything I can...

37:54.281 --> 37:56.381
...not to let you go from this nomad tent,
Noyan!

37:57.181 --> 37:59.447
Do your best!

38:07.081 --> 38:08.881
I will cause to your extinction!

38:12.747 --> 38:17.214
I will not die before I take child of
Ertugrul from womb of his mother!

38:54.514 --> 38:56.681
We killed crusaders and saved people, Bey.

38:56.814 --> 38:57.881
Thank you.

38:58.881 --> 39:00.447
God bless you.

39:01.581 --> 39:03.681
-Amen.
-As you see Ertugrul Bey.

39:04.381 --> 39:08.147
These fertile lands and people
under cruelty...

39:09.147 --> 39:11.414
...waits for a Bey that can save them.

39:12.481 --> 39:15.847
A Bey that can conquer heart of these
people and lands.

39:17.747 --> 39:20.381
If God permits, when the time comes...

39:20.447 --> 39:23.147
...you come and settle here with
your glorious...

39:23.281 --> 39:25.281
...Kayi nomad group and with
your valiant men.

39:25.381 --> 39:26.781
If God permits, Dervish Mahmut.

39:49.381 --> 39:50.481
Bey...

39:52.247 --> 39:53.281
...your hand.

39:55.114 --> 39:56.681
Thanks to God, it healed, Turgut.

39:57.447 --> 39:58.681
Praise be!

40:04.081 --> 40:06.181
Air and water of this place
came good to us, Bey.

40:06.447 --> 40:09.314
Everything about here is fertile, Bey.

40:09.647 --> 40:12.314
Crusaders comes here like a rain.

40:12.681 --> 40:15.414
As Dervish Mahmut brother said,
I am begging you...

40:15.514 --> 40:17.747
...we should not be late to come back
to these lands.

40:18.381 --> 40:20.681
If God permits, we will be here soon,
Bamsi.

40:21.647 --> 40:22.681
Dervish Mahmut.

40:22.814 --> 40:24.147
Yes, my Bey.

40:24.581 --> 40:26.514
What will happen to these people?

40:33.747 --> 40:36.081
Bad smell disperses quickly, Bey.

40:36.681 --> 40:39.081
From now on, their lives are in danger.

41:14.114 --> 41:16.181
Welcome, Sungurtekin Bey.

41:16.714 --> 41:20.247
Finally I had honor of seeing you
before I die.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.447
Come and sit.

41:37.414 --> 41:40.181
I was always curious about spy that...

41:40.614 --> 41:44.781
...Sultan Aleaddin Keykubat has
eves only for.

41:50.581 --> 41:52.481
Who can think that spy is son of...

41:53.114 --> 41:58.881
...Suleyman Shah which known as dead?

42:00.314 --> 42:02.881
It is true that Sultan has only
eyes for me.

42:04.447 --> 42:08.181
But someone from palace learned who I am.

42:09.581 --> 42:11.647
If he would not inform Ogeday about me...

42:12.247 --> 42:14.614
...I would be still on my duty.

42:16.881 --> 42:18.481
Duty.

42:22.281 --> 42:25.581
I cannot describe the passion
you feel for your duty.

42:25.847 --> 42:27.614
But I want you to know that...

42:28.147 --> 42:30.614
...after you came to palace and
told what happened...

42:30.881 --> 42:36.347
...you cannot imagine
how many lost their lives.

42:40.547 --> 42:43.814
Palace is a fertile place for traitors
so that they materialize.

42:46.347 --> 42:48.281
If God permits, you got rid of traitors!

42:49.714 --> 42:52.147
Even my family believed that
I was dead for years.

42:53.181 --> 42:58.481
My mother, father, brothers
endured with it.

43:00.514 --> 43:04.181
Except Sultan, no one knew about
me at all.

43:05.747 --> 43:08.647
Until someone denounced me in palace.

43:09.681 --> 43:11.414
All lingered.

43:13.214 --> 43:17.581
With the information you shared about
Mongolians, we made peace, know it.

43:25.881 --> 43:28.681
I want you to know that...

43:29.681 --> 43:32.114
...I am grateful with...

43:35.781 --> 43:38.481
...the name of our people and state.

43:57.447 --> 43:58.847
Thank you.

44:02.081 --> 44:05.414
Because of being a denounced spy
your duty is over.

44:06.747 --> 44:11.814
I want you to live in your nomad group
as a valiant Alp.

44:12.081 --> 44:13.481
You deserved it.

44:14.514 --> 44:17.481
But there is a fall on your
shoulder with...

44:18.247 --> 44:21.781
...the name of our state for peace.

44:24.714 --> 44:26.614
Be careful about Beys of
both nomad groups.

44:27.181 --> 44:30.514
Do not make them change their mind
about being in the way of peace.

44:32.447 --> 44:35.514
Conclusions of it will be bad
for everybody!

44:36.147 --> 44:39.747
It will be unpredictably bad
no one can foresee it!

44:46.614 --> 44:48.614
For the benefit of state,...

44:49.547 --> 44:52.847
...I will do whatever it takes,
Ameer Sadettin Kobek.

44:56.214 --> 44:57.481
With your permission.

45:00.781 --> 45:02.814
May God help you, son.

45:43.881 --> 45:49.281
Genghis Khan never left anyone
behind before!

45:51.247 --> 45:53.114
Noyan did not as well.

45:54.881 --> 45:57.747
You cannot be a patch of Noyan.

46:01.881 --> 46:03.514
Tangut.

46:06.614 --> 46:09.247
Sadettin Kobek waits for you in
caravansary.

46:21.281 --> 46:23.381
We will have a break in here.

46:23.714 --> 46:25.147
Halt!

47:10.847 --> 47:13.581
With you help, poor people got joyful,
Bey.

47:15.081 --> 47:17.514
I hope same will come to
other oppressed people.

47:17.647 --> 47:18.847
Amen.

47:19.881 --> 47:23.114
Brother, when I have a look on how poor...

47:24.081 --> 47:26.681
...these people are I justify
prophet Kirmani.

47:27.081 --> 47:28.247
Thank you brother.

47:28.381 --> 47:30.481
Brother, do you know what I say?

47:31.181 --> 47:34.081
Can we do trading at odd moments?

47:36.547 --> 47:39.147
Trading is not like using a weapon,
brother.

47:39.281 --> 47:40.814
Why do you think in this way, brother?

47:41.114 --> 47:43.781
We can hold money with the hands
we hold weapon.

47:44.181 --> 47:46.681
Eventually, there is no killing or dying.

47:47.314 --> 47:49.781
What kind of things you are capable of?
What will you sell to people?

47:49.847 --> 47:51.081
Do not say it brother.

47:51.647 --> 47:54.614
I can clean around,
I can kill non-Muslims and...

47:55.114 --> 47:57.181
...I can inculcate as last option.

47:59.447 --> 48:01.314
None of them makes money.

48:01.581 --> 48:04.414
In order to make money,
you need to know about goods...

48:04.481 --> 48:08.547
...and what clients want, brother.
And also bunch of capabilities are needed.

48:09.847 --> 48:11.147
Brother...

48:11.514 --> 48:16.547
...if I knew being a trader is so detailed
I would practice on it in our free times.

48:21.281 --> 48:23.681
Yes, we do not know about trading,...

48:24.781 --> 48:26.714
...we do not know how to plant as well.

48:27.281 --> 48:30.147
But, we know one thing very well.

48:30.581 --> 48:32.481
Give the work to its expert.

48:33.647 --> 48:38.547
If we become an ocean,
all rivers will flow to us.

48:39.247 --> 48:43.447
If we have a home, we will take
best craftsman...

48:43.881 --> 48:48.647
...artisan, traders and poets with us.

48:49.281 --> 48:53.447
We will make these lands as center of
halal income.

48:53.781 --> 48:57.881
The main purpose is not to earn lucre,
brother.

48:58.347 --> 49:01.614
It is earning in halal way and sharing
what is earned.

49:02.381 --> 49:05.181
Lucre gets fertile when it is shared.

49:06.081 --> 49:09.681
Now, so witness me God...

49:10.681 --> 49:14.814
...we will destroy this savage system.

49:16.147 --> 49:20.514
There will be justice and order
in these lands.

49:20.781 --> 49:22.247
Thank you, Bey.

49:23.114 --> 49:24.714
Thank you, Bey.

49:34.147 --> 49:38.081
If we release cur Noyan,
he will win the war.

49:38.547 --> 49:42.481
It means we lose the peace. It is obvious.

49:43.214 --> 49:44.881
There is nothing else I can say.

49:46.114 --> 49:47.447
Gundogdu Bey is right.

49:47.881 --> 49:51.081
Our tradition says to be with justice,
is not it?

49:52.881 --> 49:56.814
Will Noyan's leave freely
suite to our justice, father?

50:10.581 --> 50:12.181
I am sorry.

50:23.514 --> 50:28.581
It is possible that tradition, justice and
peace may come together.

50:29.247 --> 50:33.281
But for this, execution of Noyan is
a must!

50:37.147 --> 50:39.814
We suffered a lot, because of Noyan.

50:40.481 --> 50:42.081
We lost many lives.

50:43.281 --> 50:45.714
We cannot let him go
like an innocent pigeon...

50:46.147 --> 50:50.614
...while we captured him by our own hands.

50:53.847 --> 50:56.681
Even this idea makes me out of control.

50:59.547 --> 51:00.847
What about our Alps?

51:01.614 --> 51:05.514
In many battles, many Alps became martyr.

51:06.647 --> 51:10.647
Is not it being disrespectful to wives,
sons...

51:11.114 --> 51:14.747
...fathers to people left behind
by our martyr?

51:15.481 --> 51:20.481
Many Alps became veteran
in numerous battles with us.

51:21.514 --> 51:27.147
How can we release this ignoble
while we look to eyes of our veterans?

51:27.481 --> 51:28.881
Obedience to state.

51:29.881 --> 51:32.847
This is the only way out.

51:34.681 --> 51:36.281
What are you saying, father?

51:38.114 --> 51:40.147
Korkut Bey is right, Tugtekin Bey.

51:42.381 --> 51:45.281
We need to think with logic,
not with anger.

51:49.481 --> 51:51.281
What are you saying, brother?

51:52.381 --> 51:55.814
Do not you know what he has done to you...

51:56.181 --> 51:58.414
...your brothers and mother in
migration caravan?

51:59.547 --> 52:03.147
What do you suggest?
We should let this ignoble leave?

52:04.447 --> 52:06.547
I cannot believe we sit in here and
talk on these.

52:08.581 --> 52:11.081
Are you aware of what you are saying?

52:14.314 --> 52:15.314
Gumustekin Bey.

52:16.214 --> 52:17.614
Do not you have anything to say?

52:17.881 --> 52:22.447
I am ready to give my life in order
to take Noyan's.

52:23.114 --> 52:24.514
But...

52:24.881 --> 52:30.814
...we need to deal with this matter
with brotherhood and facility.

52:33.614 --> 52:36.647
Road of facility and brotherhood
passes by peace.

52:38.447 --> 52:42.714
For peace, we need to clean dirt and
dust from our hearts.

52:44.447 --> 52:47.280
Dirt and dust are these, Sungurtekin Bey!

52:48.747 --> 52:51.414
They burned my daughter
in front of my eyes.

52:52.280 --> 52:56.181
They murdered our brothers and sisters.

52:57.214 --> 52:59.247
If we do not take revenge of them...

53:00.414 --> 53:02.280
...neither their souls will
rest in peace...

53:02.347 --> 53:04.247
...nor these dirt and dust
will be purified.

53:08.314 --> 53:11.114
You talk about not obeying
order of state.

53:13.447 --> 53:16.747
Do you hear what you are saying?

53:24.447 --> 53:25.747
What a shame!

53:30.114 --> 53:35.247
I thought you will come and be
in the side of tradition and justice.

53:36.214 --> 53:40.247
But I see that fear filled your veins.

53:44.114 --> 53:45.347
What a shame!

53:47.747 --> 53:49.181
Tugtekin!

53:54.514 --> 53:57.214
Tomorrow morning, we will run headquarter
and decide on it.

54:00.147 --> 54:01.214
Yes...

54:01.414 --> 54:04.581
...we should leave justice to Beys
of headquarter so that it is spoiled!

54:07.847 --> 54:09.847
When you changed like this, brother?

54:13.514 --> 54:16.214
I say Ameer Sadettin Kobek should
also join to headquarter.

54:22.114 --> 54:24.314
So that he can see the suffer within us.

54:25.381 --> 54:28.181
Whatever our decision is he hears it
with his own ears.

55:00.114 --> 55:01.247
Bey.

55:03.847 --> 55:05.481
I saw you are so furious...

55:07.381 --> 55:11.347
More he got aged, more afraid
and lost his dreams.

55:11.614 --> 55:13.881
Now he tramples on his honor.

55:17.381 --> 55:18.814
Do not say it...

55:19.481 --> 55:20.547
...he is your father.

55:20.714 --> 55:23.281
All he says is to give Noyan back
nothing else, Gokce.

55:25.181 --> 55:26.514
Nothing else.

55:29.647 --> 55:31.681
After my mother died, my father
changed a lot.

55:32.214 --> 55:34.314
He is an old man what I cannot
recognize anymore.

55:36.214 --> 55:37.847
Now, he is on tail of Sungurtekin.

55:41.214 --> 55:44.281
Gundogdu brother made a mistake with
bringing him back to nomad tent.

55:46.514 --> 55:48.347
If you would be head of Alps...

55:48.714 --> 55:51.381
...you would bring his head, not himself.

55:53.181 --> 55:54.581
If you would be Bey...

55:55.814 --> 55:57.547
...you would not give him to anybody.

56:09.281 --> 56:11.347
Everything comes with time, Bey.

56:12.314 --> 56:13.814
Everything comes with time.

56:24.147 --> 56:25.414
What are you saying, brother?

56:25.547 --> 56:28.447
Do not you know what
he has done to you and your family?

56:28.881 --> 56:30.747
What about the things he done to Ertugrul?

56:31.881 --> 56:33.247
Of course I know, brother.

56:33.414 --> 56:36.081
But state needs to dress the wounds
like we did.

56:37.581 --> 56:39.614
This peace will empower our state.

56:41.747 --> 56:44.547
What peace you are talking about, brother?

56:44.647 --> 56:46.681
Mongolians do not want peace at all!

56:46.814 --> 56:48.381
Do not you see it?

56:48.447 --> 56:49.681
They will attack again.

56:49.814 --> 56:51.714
They will attack after they gain strength.

56:53.747 --> 56:56.547
Brother, neither Mongolians want peace...

56:56.747 --> 56:59.281
...nor we can get rid of this
Mongolian trouble.

57:00.081 --> 57:02.581
Bu sure that I am not that blind.

57:03.114 --> 57:04.214
I know the truth!

57:04.681 --> 57:05.814
I know the truth...

57:06.247 --> 57:08.881
...but I will not be a prisoner by
surrounding anger.

57:11.714 --> 57:15.114
If Ertugrul Bey would be here he would not
let this cur live.

57:16.081 --> 57:18.714
Whoever lives under shadow of
this marquee...

57:19.347 --> 57:22.214
...knows that Noyan will not stop of
killing.

57:24.747 --> 57:27.814
He even knows the baby
inside of womb of Halime.

57:33.214 --> 57:36.881
His impudent, ominous, shameless pack...

57:37.114 --> 57:38.881
...know about our weak sides.

57:39.314 --> 57:42.214
They know about our love and
respect to each other...

57:42.281 --> 57:44.681
...and makes trap to us based
on these weaknesses.

58:02.347 --> 58:04.581
There is also possibility of losing
the purpose...

58:04.747 --> 58:08.381
...like grasses smashed
under cavorting of bulls.

58:10.447 --> 58:11.747
You are right, father.

58:13.314 --> 58:15.714
Who faced up to what for this seal?

58:16.381 --> 58:18.881
You will get what you wanted from
Sadettin Kobek.

58:19.547 --> 58:23.281
There is no obstacle remained
for being margrave, brother.

58:24.247 --> 58:26.481
He is henchman of Sultan Aleaddin...

58:27.481 --> 58:30.881
...most reliable man in palace, Aytolun.

58:32.314 --> 58:37.147
If we consider he rushed his horse
to take Noyan from nomad group.

58:38.247 --> 58:39.881
What are you trying to say, Brother?

58:40.814 --> 58:44.481
Obviously there is purpose behind
purpose, Aytolun.

58:45.147 --> 58:47.481
Our part is not to be smashed like grass.

58:51.514 --> 58:53.147
Bring me the seal!

58:53.547 --> 58:56.514
I will take it with me and I go to
see Kobek.

59:01.214 --> 59:04.147
So Noyan? What about him?

59:05.881 --> 59:07.814
It serves to my purpose if he dies.

59:09.281 --> 59:11.714
I know that he knows most private secrets.

59:12.414 --> 59:16.281
You, me, daughter my connections
in palace, everything.

59:19.081 --> 59:21.314
I can understand it from his eyes.

59:22.847 --> 59:26.881
What else a man know that knows
things between me and Sadettin Kobek.

59:29.314 --> 59:30.847
Bring me seal in the evening.

59:32.147 --> 59:34.281
Stop poisoning Korkut.

59:39.147 --> 59:42.681
After I talk to Kobek, I will make
my decision.

01:00:01.581 --> 01:00:03.581
What if Banu Cicek would not come?

01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:06.881
What Korkut Bey would do to you?

01:00:09.881 --> 01:00:12.681
From now on, I will keep you
out of this matter, Halime.

01:00:12.814 --> 01:00:15.281
You are pregnant matters like that
are not for you.

01:00:15.781 --> 01:00:18.481
I am inside of it as much as you are,
Selcan.

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:19.847
I will not give up!

01:00:20.114 --> 01:00:21.581
I am begging you sister.

01:00:21.714 --> 01:00:23.847
Do not make me regret because of
telling it to you.

01:00:26.214 --> 01:00:28.347
There is something with Banu Cicek,
Selcan.

01:00:29.581 --> 01:00:31.714
She knows some things, but she hides.

01:00:33.147 --> 01:00:37.514
She is stuck in loyalty she feels for Bey
and suspicion that oppress on her.

01:00:42.081 --> 01:00:44.847
Our part is not to let it go, Selcan.

01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:49.514
Halime!

01:01:00.928 --> 01:01:03.428
Korkut Bey went to Artuk Bey.
He is giving blood.

01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:06.461
Do you have any other commands
Aytolun Hatun?

01:01:06.728 --> 01:01:08.861
I do not, Banu Cicek. You can leave.

01:03:02.094 --> 01:03:04.794
People can pay their taxes
with this gold.

01:03:05.861 --> 01:03:09.728
People who are in trouble
can go to Seljukian lands...

01:03:09.794 --> 01:03:11.361
...and can build a new life there.

01:03:12.228 --> 01:03:15.761
If God permits
they will come back to their land.

01:03:16.761 --> 01:03:18.294
God bless you, Bey.

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:20.161
Thank you, Mahmut Dervish.

01:03:22.861 --> 01:03:26.394
We will leave early in the morning
and return to our nomad group.

01:03:26.828 --> 01:03:28.861
We did very well by coming here.

01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:35.228
As I said, Ertugrul Bey, the person
who will conquer this land...

01:03:35.294 --> 01:03:39.794
...will also conquer
the hearts of the oppressed non–Muslims.

01:03:40.194 --> 01:03:44.761
He will not only rescue people from
the Crusaders and non-Muslims...

01:03:45.294 --> 01:03:51.028
...as long as this valiant Bey comes with
his Alps and enlivens this land.

01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:54.928
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:03:54.994 --> 01:03:56.128
Amen.

01:04:22.094 --> 01:04:26.094
Why do you not tell me clearly
what is going on, Ameer Sadettin Kobek?

01:04:30.128 --> 01:04:31.994
Do you not rely on me?

01:04:32.528 --> 01:04:37.528
First Sungurtekin, then
the seal of Oghuz Khan and now Noyan.

01:04:38.194 --> 01:04:39.928
You got what you want.

01:04:42.728 --> 01:04:47.828
As I stated in my latter
there is no obstacle left for a margrave.

01:04:50.028 --> 01:04:51.328
What about Noyan?

01:04:53.361 --> 01:04:55.794
How does he know everything about us?

01:04:56.194 --> 01:04:59.461
I removed the Mongolian spies
from the palace, Gumustekin.

01:05:08.094 --> 01:05:11.828
The biggest trouble is that bastard
Noyan. Do you not know that?

01:05:12.394 --> 01:05:16.294
He will do anything to use
what he knows against me when he is free.

01:05:16.794 --> 01:05:19.028
Noyan will not be free
for himself, Gumustekin.

01:05:20.294 --> 01:05:22.961
He will be free for the sake of peace.

01:05:24.328 --> 01:05:26.794
You will do best you can do
in the Headquarters.

01:05:28.261 --> 01:05:29.994
Leave the rest to me.

01:05:34.828 --> 01:05:36.361
Did you bring the seal?

01:05:55.494 --> 01:05:59.528
How can you be so sure that Noyan
will not cause any trouble to me?

01:06:03.861 --> 01:06:06.528
We all saw what he could do for this seal.

01:06:07.028 --> 01:06:10.494
He kidnapped Selcan and was captured.
He almost died.

01:06:10.961 --> 01:06:13.761
Noyan will not be able to cause
any trouble to anybody.

01:06:33.328 --> 01:06:35.294
This gold is for your margrave.

01:06:36.428 --> 01:06:39.961
If anybody is against your margrave
you will bring them to heel with gold.

01:06:40.728 --> 01:06:44.828
If anybody is stubborn, then you will
bring them to heel with poison and...

01:06:44.894 --> 01:06:47.061
...if it is not enough
then you will use your sword.

01:06:47.761 --> 01:06:53.761
As for the seal,
this seal will open so many locks...

01:06:54.128 --> 01:06:55.928
...and guide us.

01:06:59.761 --> 01:07:02.094
Now, give me that seal.

01:07:22.261 --> 01:07:27.228
Now go and do not let
the Beys of the nomad groups...

01:07:27.528 --> 01:07:29.328
...break the peace in the Headquarters.

01:07:31.328 --> 01:07:32.861
Do not forget!

01:07:33.861 --> 01:07:39.161
If there is no state,
then there is no margrave either.

01:08:21.528 --> 01:08:25.528
If you show mercy to your enemy
one day he makes you sole to his boots.

01:08:29.161 --> 01:08:34.528
If we release that bastard, you know what
will happen as much as we do, brother.

01:08:39.861 --> 01:08:42.794
I met with Ameer Sadettin Kobek
in caravansary today.

01:08:47.728 --> 01:08:52.128
Do not expect that I will endanger
my nomad group and marquee on purpose.

01:08:53.928 --> 01:08:56.761
Especially for that palace bastard
Sadettin Kobek.

01:08:56.828 --> 01:08:57.928
Mother...

01:08:58.794 --> 01:09:00.461
Our state wanted peace...

01:09:02.028 --> 01:09:05.061
...and Ameer Sadettin Kobek came to the
nomad tent to do what is necessary.

01:09:06.394 --> 01:09:08.394
The command of the state
will be executed.

01:09:09.094 --> 01:09:11.194
No one can stop it now.

01:09:14.261 --> 01:09:21.094
When it comes to that bastard Noyan,
our state will not give rein to him.

01:09:22.861 --> 01:09:24.094
You can trust my words.

01:09:27.794 --> 01:09:34.128
He will get what he deserves
when the time comes.

01:10:06.028 --> 01:10:08.294
Trader Abdullah is here
and he wants to see you.

01:10:09.894 --> 01:10:11.361
Send him in.

01:10:19.428 --> 01:10:22.028
You wanted to see me
Ameer Sadettin Kobek?

01:10:51.328 --> 01:10:55.228
Something happens to you soldiers
when the war ends.

01:10:55.294 --> 01:10:57.361
You became like fish out of water.

01:10:59.894 --> 01:11:01.994
Do you not know that
there is not peace for a Mongolian?

01:11:02.061 --> 01:11:03.528
How should I not know that?

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.328
That is why I asked for you.

01:11:07.794 --> 01:11:09.261
What do you want?

01:11:12.428 --> 01:11:14.394
I will take Noyan from Kayis.

01:11:15.828 --> 01:11:18.361
You would be more pleased
if I did not, did you?

01:11:20.028 --> 01:11:23.094
-What did you say?
-Put that dagger back.

01:11:23.528 --> 01:11:26.894
Do not play the loyal soldier to me.

01:11:28.094 --> 01:11:34.094
We know very well that Noyan
is a trouble maker and needs to be killed.

01:11:34.961 --> 01:11:36.528
Do not play with me.

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:38.794
It will end badly.

01:11:39.094 --> 01:11:41.294
Do you know what I see
when I look at you?

01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:45.794
A loyal soldier of Ogeday.

01:11:46.428 --> 01:11:49.461
Not a swag
and undisciplined man like Noyan.

01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:53.261
Even if he knows that the peace is
very close...

01:11:53.494 --> 01:11:56.028
...he put himself in so much trouble.

01:11:56.361 --> 01:11:59.228
He went there
and gave his head to Gundogdu.

01:12:00.761 --> 01:12:03.394
If there was not
a peace contract in question...

01:12:03.961 --> 01:12:07.394
...I would have been
happier than you for his execution.

01:12:08.494 --> 01:12:14.261
Unfortunately, I have to take him from
Kayis' hands because of the peace.

01:12:14.894 --> 01:12:17.094
But I would like to work with you

01:12:17.161 --> 01:12:21.094
instead of him
while a new system is being established.

01:12:24.394 --> 01:12:29.361
We will both make profit
for the war tax paid to Ogeday.

01:12:30.394 --> 01:12:34.861
If Noyan lives, we both lose.

01:12:38.494 --> 01:12:40.494
What do you want from me?

01:12:44.028 --> 01:12:47.394
Kill Noyan
and replace him as the commander.

01:12:52.794 --> 01:12:54.894
It will be a good negotiation.

01:12:56.094 --> 01:12:57.261
Kind of.

01:12:57.328 --> 01:12:58.994
There is no negotiation.

01:13:00.061 --> 01:13:04.394
Kill Noyan and replace him
as the commander. It is that easy.

01:13:05.494 --> 01:13:08.794
Why wouldl Ogeday
make me the commander?

01:13:15.294 --> 01:13:17.428
I like smart men.

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:21.328
Clearly, our partnership will be good.

01:13:21.994 --> 01:13:24.161
You did not answer my question.

01:13:26.761 --> 01:13:28.994
Because I have what Ogeday want.

01:13:29.761 --> 01:13:33.728
If I give it to you,
you become the commander.

01:13:34.461 --> 01:13:36.028
What is that?

01:13:38.361 --> 01:13:40.461
The seal of Oghuz Khan.

01:13:46.794 --> 01:13:51.028
Do you have the seal
whih is the death warrant of Noyan?

01:13:58.528 --> 01:14:00.494
What do you want in return?

01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:12.461
If you accept my conditions
I give the seal to you but only...

01:14:13.794 --> 01:14:16.128
...if you accept my conditions.

01:14:20.361 --> 01:14:22.094
What are your conditions?

01:14:42.861 --> 01:14:45.028
How is that even possible, Artuk Bey?

01:14:45.528 --> 01:14:49.228
He talks about releasing that bastard
who harmed his mother, sister...

01:14:49.294 --> 01:14:52.261
...wife and brother.

01:14:53.428 --> 01:14:56.028
Why does Sungurtekin Bey do that?

01:15:00.961 --> 01:15:04.994
The mind of people and the mind of
the state do not work the same way.

01:15:15.961 --> 01:15:17.228
Wild Demir!

01:15:19.161 --> 01:15:21.328
I have no more words to say to you.

01:15:21.961 --> 01:15:23.961
And the warmth of my heart
withered off.

01:15:24.294 --> 01:15:26.128
Forgive me, Bey.

01:15:26.761 --> 01:15:29.928
If God permits, other Beys will not listen
to you in the Headquarters meeting...

01:15:30.461 --> 01:15:34.494
...and Gundogdu Bey
takes that bastard Noyan's head.

01:15:44.394 --> 01:15:47.061
He still suffers because of his daughter.

01:15:48.161 --> 01:15:52.794
I know that
and it upsets me a lot Artuk Bey.

01:15:55.494 --> 01:16:00.261
Sometimes the price of truth is
heavier than the price of wrong, Bey.

01:16:01.394 --> 01:16:03.994
He will
stand behind his words, though.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.461
Thank you.

01:16:07.161 --> 01:16:09.361
I talked to Ameer Sadettin Kobek today.

01:16:10.228 --> 01:16:12.461
There is no solution other than peace.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:15.794
And we have to release Noyan for that.

01:16:17.961 --> 01:16:19.161
What about Noyan?

01:16:19.494 --> 01:16:21.728
You know that Noyan will wiggle.

01:16:23.194 --> 01:16:24.528
Of course, I know.

01:16:25.994 --> 01:16:28.461
That is why me and Ertugrul's duty is
to take precautions.

01:16:29.461 --> 01:16:31.394
I will do all I can, Bey.

01:17:14.294 --> 01:17:16.161
May God accept it, my daughter.

01:17:16.428 --> 01:17:18.894
Amen. Thank you, mother.

01:17:20.461 --> 01:17:24.328
I spent a lifetime waiting.

01:17:28.261 --> 01:17:32.161
I waited for Suleyman Shah's return...

01:17:33.061 --> 01:17:36.028
...from so many wars and my sons
to get out of so many troubles.

01:17:39.428 --> 01:17:40.861
Waiting...

01:17:43.194 --> 01:17:45.494
You have said that
the fate of the woman of Kayi is this.

01:17:47.361 --> 01:17:50.294
And I came to this marquee
lovingly as a bride.

01:17:52.394 --> 01:17:54.994
As long as God speed Ertugrul Bey.

01:17:56.828 --> 01:17:59.828
As long as I see that he returns to
his child and nomad tent.

01:18:02.194 --> 01:18:06.228
I will experience the grief of waiting
and the beauty of coming together...

01:18:07.461 --> 01:18:09.928
...with you until I die, mother.

01:18:12.161 --> 01:18:13.428
My beautiful daughter.

01:18:16.961 --> 01:18:21.994
Suleyman Shah told me
when I saw him in my dream.

01:18:23.294 --> 01:18:27.728
Hayme, we will all die one day.

01:18:28.128 --> 01:18:35.028
But people living in this marquee
will have more than that.

01:19:19.194 --> 01:19:20.994
<i>-Ertugrul!</i>
-Father!

01:19:24.461 --> 01:19:26.728
<i>-Ertugrul!</i>
-Father!

01:19:30.294 --> 01:19:31.894
Father!

01:19:42.894 --> 01:19:44.361
<i>Ertugrul!</i>

01:20:09.961 --> 01:20:11.394
<i>Ertugrul!</i>

01:20:21.761 --> 01:20:22.928
Father!

01:20:22.994 --> 01:20:24.361
<i>Ertugrul!</i>

01:20:47.128 --> 01:20:48.828
Father!

01:20:52.794 --> 01:20:54.394
Come on, sit down next to me.

01:21:26.294 --> 01:21:30.294
You went to various places,
from the Caspian Sea...

01:21:33.061 --> 01:21:36.161
...to Ahlat, from Ahlat to Aleppo...

01:21:37.994 --> 01:21:43.061
...from Aleppo to Erzurum.

01:21:45.928 --> 01:21:51.728
In these places you go, you became
the honor of Kayi tribe...

01:21:53.094 --> 01:21:58.728
...the pride of our tribe,
and the flag of Islam.

01:21:58.994 --> 01:22:03.328
I just followed your way father,
and I will do the same hereafter.

01:22:05.994 --> 01:22:09.494
The roads that Kayi tribe, you...

01:22:10.994 --> 01:22:17.894
...and Oghuz was on exile
showed its light to you son.

01:22:19.794 --> 01:22:22.094
Be a follower of that light.

01:22:23.461 --> 01:22:27.861
Thus you can be a new hope...

01:22:29.261 --> 01:22:33.028
...and you can open the doors of
a new world state for your descendants.

01:22:34.761 --> 01:22:36.794
The ones with you...

01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:43.794
...and behind you
will be happy with the honor of this.

01:22:51.861 --> 01:22:53.528
From the North to the South.

01:22:55.228 --> 01:22:57.161
From the East to the West.

01:22:58.928 --> 01:23:01.128
A big oak tree with branches...

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:07.494
...will be raised in these lands.

01:23:29.461 --> 01:23:31.828
Your son, Osman.

01:23:33.761 --> 01:23:36.294
He will change our fate.

01:23:38.328 --> 01:23:41.161
He will take root of Oghuz in these lands.

01:24:00.828 --> 01:24:07.461
May your generation follow
God's order and make war.

01:24:13.994 --> 01:24:15.928
Do not forget, son.

01:24:16.761 --> 01:24:19.094
Child is the essence of a father.

01:24:23.728 --> 01:24:28.428
May God be his helper, son.

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:44.294
Father!

01:24:48.128 --> 01:24:49.728
Father!

01:25:07.428 --> 01:25:08.928
Osman.

01:25:46.728 --> 01:25:48.028
Osman.

01:26:05.794 --> 01:26:07.861
How could you fall into carelessness...

01:26:08.261 --> 01:26:11.061
...and bring together the Headquarters
for that bastard Mongolian?

01:26:11.294 --> 01:26:13.361
Is this fair?

01:26:17.528 --> 01:26:20.028
Everybody wants justice, son.

01:26:20.361 --> 01:26:24.761
But it is not wise to act with anger.

01:26:25.361 --> 01:26:27.294
You need to think.

01:26:27.861 --> 01:26:29.761
We brought
the Headquarter together for this.

01:26:29.828 --> 01:26:31.028
The Headquarters?

01:26:31.494 --> 01:26:33.428
The Headquarters!

01:26:33.994 --> 01:26:39.061
You will hand that cruel man who killed
so many people out with your own hands.

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:43.428
Sadettin Kobek will bridle you and
make you do what he wants.

01:26:45.061 --> 01:26:47.261
But I will not share your sin, father.

01:26:49.228 --> 01:26:54.461
I do not care about
neither the Headquarters nor your verdict.

01:27:27.961 --> 01:27:30.394
Ameer Sadettin Kobek...

01:27:32.728 --> 01:27:39.528
...wants to be our guest
and see what our Beys think.

01:27:41.728 --> 01:27:43.028
May I have your permission?

01:27:43.128 --> 01:27:45.194
-He is welcome.
-He is welcome.

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:46.528
He is welcome.

01:27:47.094 --> 01:27:52.528
He is welcome. He can come and
see our pain and anger with his own eyes.

01:27:52.761 --> 01:27:53.761
He is welcome.

01:27:53.861 --> 01:27:56.094
He can come and see.

01:27:56.161 --> 01:27:57.994
He still did not understand our pain.

01:28:12.228 --> 01:28:15.361
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:28:15.428 --> 01:28:21.128
May God help us give a right verdict.

01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:22.861
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:28:23.794 --> 01:28:25.061
Thank you.

01:28:40.094 --> 01:28:41.728
Go ahead!

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:45.728
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

01:29:46.928 --> 01:29:53.228
By the 99 names
of the gracious and merciful God...

01:29:57.028 --> 01:29:58.994
...I start the Headquarters.

01:30:51.161 --> 01:30:53.361
The furious boy caught fire again.

01:30:55.094 --> 01:30:56.728
He climbs the walls.

01:30:57.728 --> 01:31:00.728
He rubs salt in the wound
that I made on his chest.

01:31:50.794 --> 01:31:55.161
It is not possible
to forgive a killer like Noyan!

01:31:55.261 --> 01:31:56.961
-Yes, we will not forgive him!
-Yes!

01:31:57.028 --> 01:31:58.994
-We will not forgive.
-We will not accept.

01:31:59.061 --> 01:32:03.094
It is betrayal. It means to object
our tradition and our religion.

01:32:03.161 --> 01:32:04.961
-You are right.
-He is right.

01:32:05.028 --> 01:32:10.761
It is unacceptable to bring
the Headquarters together for this.

01:32:14.961 --> 01:32:18.794
We elected you as the Bey
so you can administer justice.

01:32:19.461 --> 01:32:24.028
Not to release murderers
by bending the justice.

01:32:29.128 --> 01:32:30.494
My Beys!

01:32:31.261 --> 01:32:36.528
First they took my two sons
and then my daughter from me.

01:32:37.861 --> 01:32:44.461
Do you want me to forgive this cruel
murderer before my gravid daughter...

01:32:45.394 --> 01:32:50.794
...and my unborn grandchild's body
mixes with the soil?

01:32:52.061 --> 01:32:53.228
No.

01:32:53.861 --> 01:32:57.294
Neither will I forgive him
nor leave him alive.

01:32:57.894 --> 01:32:59.994
-You are right.
-He is right.

01:33:00.228 --> 01:33:02.261
Are you not ashamed?
We had so many martyrs.

01:33:02.528 --> 01:33:04.261
-He is right.
-You are right.

01:33:04.361 --> 01:33:05.994
Shame on you!

01:33:06.094 --> 01:33:10.161
-Our martyrs' blood are shed for a reason!
-Shame on you!

01:33:12.294 --> 01:33:15.028
God Almighty ordered in the Quran:

01:33:15.494 --> 01:33:21.194
"O you who have believed, enter the state
of submission collectively

01:33:21.894 --> 01:33:25.361
and do not follow the steps of devil
for he is clearly your enemy."

01:33:27.728 --> 01:33:29.761
Artuk Bey is right.

01:33:30.028 --> 01:33:32.861
Peace is our state's way.

01:33:34.194 --> 01:33:36.361
The way of the Mongolians
is the devil's way.

01:33:36.961 --> 01:33:41.428
If we enter this way
there will be no return from that.

01:33:46.428 --> 01:33:48.928
It is obvious that
the devil makes you talk.

01:33:49.394 --> 01:33:54.094
He makes you talk
and you do not hear what you are saying.

01:33:55.528 --> 01:33:56.961
Wild Demir!

01:33:57.728 --> 01:34:01.161
Nobody wants Noyan
to leave here freely.

01:34:01.328 --> 01:34:03.094
This is not the matter.

01:34:11.761 --> 01:34:13.061
My Beys!

01:34:14.994 --> 01:34:17.761
I did not tell you the truth
when I came back to the tent.

01:34:18.294 --> 01:34:21.061
It is not true that
I was captured by the Mongolians...

01:34:21.128 --> 01:34:23.994
...and took care of the horses of the
Ogeday family.

01:34:32.461 --> 01:34:38.861
I succeeded to become the best man of
Ogeday due to my friendship with Noyan.

01:34:42.894 --> 01:34:48.161
As a spy of our sultan
I lived within these devils for years.

01:34:51.294 --> 01:34:57.794
None of you can know Noyan,
Genghis Khan and his sons better than me.

01:34:59.961 --> 01:35:02.894
All of your words are true.

01:35:04.728 --> 01:35:11.528
Not only to kill Noyan but kill them
all is halal to us like our mother's milk.

01:35:13.494 --> 01:35:16.728
But it is not about getting what
we deserve. It is about surviving

01:35:18.328 --> 01:35:23.894
and protecting the unity and
the solidarity of our state.

01:35:48.428 --> 01:35:53.061
Did you think that
you can get away with attacking...

01:35:53.128 --> 01:35:56.128
...my nomad group and taking
so many lives? Tell me, Noyan.

01:36:02.494 --> 01:36:05.528
Go to the ends of the earth, Furious Boy.

01:36:06.361 --> 01:36:11.061
Do that so you can sleep
in your bed comfortably.

01:36:11.994 --> 01:36:13.394
Hit me, come on.

01:36:14.061 --> 01:36:17.394
Hit me so you can get rid of the worms
that nibble you.

01:36:18.861 --> 01:36:22.894
Bring me to account for your body
that I knifed like a goat.

01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:24.994
Right?

01:37:10.028 --> 01:37:15.394
If our state wants peace
and it convinced our enemy to it...

01:37:16.394 --> 01:37:22.394
...it is for us and
our state to live forever.

01:37:24.728 --> 01:37:26.761
That is why we have to follow...

01:37:26.828 --> 01:37:31.394
...our state's command
without being overwhelmed by our anger.

01:37:34.328 --> 01:37:40.261
It is our duty to be with our state
in peace just like we did in war.

01:37:57.761 --> 01:38:01.861
I believe it is time
to take the Beys' opinions...

01:38:02.461 --> 01:38:04.961
...to solve this problem.

01:38:06.794 --> 01:38:12.161
On this way that is thinner
than hair and sharper than sword...

01:38:12.461 --> 01:38:15.294
...we will raise hands for our
desperation, though.

01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:24.028
For the peace of our
captured commanders...

01:38:25.994 --> 01:38:29.961
...those who accept
the release of Noyan...

01:38:32.361 --> 01:38:33.994
...raise your hands.

01:39:15.861 --> 01:39:22.828
I see that
our Beys want the execution of Noyan.

01:39:52.928 --> 01:39:57.794
Either victory or raven to death.

01:40:39.028 --> 01:40:41.228
I wish my arm was broken and
I could not raise it.

01:40:51.528 --> 01:40:55.194
Raven is already here for the carcasses.

01:40:59.828 --> 01:41:03.828
From now on, nobody should wait for me
in this headquarter.

01:41:28.474 --> 01:41:29.474
God is greatest!

01:41:32.208 --> 01:41:33.641
God hears all the prayers.

01:41:36.041 --> 01:41:37.141
God is greatest!

01:41:41.508 --> 01:41:42.574
God is greatest!

01:41:44.008 --> 01:41:45.074
God is greatest!

01:41:49.041 --> 01:41:50.141
God is greatest!

01:42:03.141 --> 01:42:05.274
May God's peace and mercy be upon you.

01:42:06.941 --> 01:42:09.174
May God's peace and mercy be upon you.

01:42:14.374 --> 01:42:17.341
My God, the light of heaven and earth.

01:42:18.574 --> 01:42:19.708
You are guideline.

01:42:20.374 --> 01:42:21.608
You are powerful.

01:42:22.374 --> 01:42:24.441
We snuggle up to you with
all our helplessness.

01:42:25.241 --> 01:42:28.408
We appeal for aid from you
and expect your mercy.

01:42:35.608 --> 01:42:36.608
God!

01:42:38.108 --> 01:42:39.708
The situation of Islam is very bad.

01:42:41.541 --> 01:42:43.908
Sedition and dissension
captured all hearts.

01:42:45.341 --> 01:42:46.641
We forgot our brotherhood.

01:42:47.574 --> 01:42:49.174
We lost our sincerity.

01:42:50.341 --> 01:42:52.008
We became overwhelmed by our soul.

01:42:52.974 --> 01:42:54.474
We became partners with cruel.

01:42:56.408 --> 01:42:58.441
God! Forgive us.

01:42:59.508 --> 01:43:02.541
Clean our hearts with light of faith.

01:43:03.674 --> 01:43:06.608
God! Increase our sensation.

01:43:07.941 --> 01:43:09.508
Reinforce our sincerity.

01:43:10.608 --> 01:43:14.341
Reunite us against the cruel and enemies.

01:43:15.108 --> 01:43:17.374
Make us powerful. Make us resourceful.

01:43:19.041 --> 01:43:20.041
God!

01:43:21.241 --> 01:43:24.074
You gave us the opportunity to be
people of Prophet Muhammed.

01:43:25.141 --> 01:43:27.308
Destine us to be martyr for this cause.

01:43:28.941 --> 01:43:30.341
Do not return us from your way.

01:43:31.608 --> 01:43:33.241
Do not leave us uncompassionate.

01:43:33.974 --> 01:43:38.508
For your name's sake
destine resurrection again.

01:43:40.408 --> 01:43:42.574
Amen. Amen.

01:43:44.408 --> 01:43:45.408
Amen.

01:44:09.574 --> 01:44:11.308
I shahada...

01:44:14.274 --> 01:44:15.574
I shahada...

01:44:17.274 --> 01:44:20.141
I shahada that the God is the only One

01:44:21.541 --> 01:44:26.274
and Prophet Mohammad is his servant
and his messenger.

01:44:49.374 --> 01:44:50.508
May God speed you, Bey.

01:44:52.341 --> 01:44:53.474
Thank you, Dervish Mahmud.

01:44:54.508 --> 01:44:56.441
May God bless you and your son.

01:44:57.974 --> 01:44:59.974
You helped us very much.
-Thank you.

01:45:00.674 --> 01:45:03.441
Will you come again, right, Ertugrul Bey?

01:45:04.241 --> 01:45:06.308
If God permits, I will come
as soon as possible Edebali.

01:45:06.641 --> 01:45:08.374
If God permits, you will come, Bey.

01:45:17.674 --> 01:45:19.941
-Thank you.
-Thank you. May God speed you.

01:45:20.241 --> 01:45:21.674
-Thank you.
-May God speed you.

01:45:25.441 --> 01:45:26.508
In the name of God.

01:45:27.008 --> 01:45:28.408
Let us go to our marquee
as soon as possible, Alps!

01:45:38.708 --> 01:45:39.708
Come on!

01:46:01.074 --> 01:46:02.141
Almighty Khan.

01:46:03.108 --> 01:46:06.374
We give this non-Muslim entered
in our marquee with our own hands.

01:46:07.074 --> 01:46:13.674
But if something happens to one of
my brothers marquee it is on you.

01:46:14.041 --> 01:46:15.041
You know that.

01:46:16.608 --> 01:46:17.641
Gundogdu Bey.

01:46:20.041 --> 01:46:24.141
You know very well that our state
never forgets those who serve.

01:46:26.008 --> 01:46:28.474
Our state does not behave unjustly
especially toward Kayis.

01:46:57.174 --> 01:46:58.174
Tugtekin!

01:46:59.408 --> 01:47:00.408
Stop!

01:47:14.008 --> 01:47:15.008
Tugtekin!

01:47:18.708 --> 01:47:20.508
How can you treat a prisoner like this?

01:47:22.108 --> 01:47:24.441
Does it suit a Bey of Dodurga in future
to behave like this?

01:47:25.108 --> 01:47:29.208
To be a Bey requires destroying those
who intent to kill our people.

01:47:31.274 --> 01:47:33.708
Not to deliver to their owner.
-Tugtekin.

01:47:35.008 --> 01:47:36.341
Headquarter gave a decision.

01:47:37.508 --> 01:47:39.974
We do not have any other solution
than to follow that.

01:48:09.074 --> 01:48:12.108
I told you to kill me when you had chance,
did not I, smart boy?

01:48:12.341 --> 01:48:13.374
Soldier!

01:48:13.608 --> 01:48:16.008
I told you, did not I?

01:48:17.674 --> 01:48:19.041
This is not over, Noyan.

01:48:20.074 --> 01:48:21.341
This is not over.

01:48:22.141 --> 01:48:26.974
Sons of Suleyman Shah will make you
pay it sooner or later.

01:48:44.674 --> 01:48:46.374
Take him. Take.

01:49:48.241 --> 01:49:49.308
What did we do, brother?

01:49:49.974 --> 01:49:51.674
Tell me, Sungur? What did we do?

01:49:53.608 --> 01:49:57.441
We released the non-Muslim
who set his eye on our bread

01:49:57.674 --> 01:49:59.374
mother and sister with our own hands.

01:50:02.908 --> 01:50:04.041
I will kill Noyan, brother.

01:50:15.708 --> 01:50:19.141
If I kill him before prisoner chance
then the peace will be excused.

01:50:19.908 --> 01:50:22.241
Our commanders' token as prisoner
will die in hands of Mongolians.

01:50:23.008 --> 01:50:25.441
So, I will kill Noyan after Kobek
took and brought our commanders

01:50:26.141 --> 01:50:27.241
token as prisoner.

01:50:28.674 --> 01:50:30.241
I cannot let that happen, brother.

01:50:30.708 --> 01:50:32.541
I cannot send you alone after Noyan.

01:50:34.074 --> 01:50:35.274
I have to go, brother.

01:50:36.308 --> 01:50:38.941
You know very well what will happen
if Noyan lives.

01:50:41.974 --> 01:50:43.641
Then I will come with you, brother.

01:50:45.008 --> 01:50:47.541
This is such a way and I do not know
when I will return

01:50:48.641 --> 01:50:50.341
or I will ever return or not.

01:50:52.641 --> 01:50:54.541
You are the head of Alps
of both nomad groups.

01:50:55.541 --> 01:50:57.108
In your existence nomad group
will fall into weakness.

01:50:59.141 --> 01:51:00.274
You cannot come, brother.

01:51:05.274 --> 01:51:06.308
What about my mother?

01:51:08.908 --> 01:51:13.941
My mother is a smart woman to know
why I returned and why I went.

01:51:20.074 --> 01:51:21.541
Do not spare your prayers for me, brother.

01:51:54.241 --> 01:51:55.374
<i>Kill him!</i>

01:52:05.174 --> 01:52:06.441
Killer!

01:52:07.141 --> 01:52:09.941
Give him to us and we will kill him!

01:52:10.608 --> 01:52:12.041
Kill him!

01:52:12.541 --> 01:52:13.708
Killer!

01:52:15.508 --> 01:52:17.141
Give him to us and we will kill him!

01:52:17.508 --> 01:52:19.074
Killer! Kill him!

01:52:21.408 --> 01:52:22.541
Death for the killer!

01:52:25.308 --> 01:52:26.441
We want justice!

01:52:27.508 --> 01:52:28.674
Killer!

01:52:37.408 --> 01:52:38.574
We want justice!

01:52:42.708 --> 01:52:44.108
Noyan, the child killer!

01:52:46.541 --> 01:52:47.674
We want justice!

01:52:50.641 --> 01:52:52.474
We want justice! Kill him!

01:53:05.974 --> 01:53:07.141
We want justice!

01:53:08.574 --> 01:53:10.074
Kill him!

01:53:13.074 --> 01:53:14.674
Kill him!

01:53:15.641 --> 01:53:17.341
We want justice!

01:53:20.241 --> 01:53:21.508
Kill him!

01:53:24.574 --> 01:53:25.674
Killer!

01:53:31.408 --> 01:53:32.708
Killer!

01:53:34.041 --> 01:53:35.441
We want justice!

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:37.174
Kill him!

01:53:44.508 --> 01:53:45.541
My son...

01:53:47.008 --> 01:53:48.674
...from now on the nomad tent
is entrusted you.

01:53:49.074 --> 01:53:50.141
Wild Demir?

01:53:52.408 --> 01:53:53.541
Wait for me, Aykiz.

01:53:55.608 --> 01:53:56.908
I am coming to you.

01:53:57.941 --> 01:53:58.974
Kill him!

01:54:04.974 --> 01:54:05.974
Killer!

01:54:06.141 --> 01:54:07.241
Wild Demir!

01:54:11.008 --> 01:54:12.108
Wild Demir!

01:54:14.041 --> 01:54:15.108
Kill him!

01:54:16.641 --> 01:54:17.941
We want justice!

01:54:54.674 --> 01:54:55.708
My great God.

01:54:56.674 --> 01:54:59.941
I know, you destine me another child.

01:55:01.708 --> 01:55:03.441
Destine me to grow him in my belly

01:55:04.441 --> 01:55:08.508
and raise him as a good boy
for Gundogdu Bey.

01:55:32.508 --> 01:55:33.641
May God accept, Selcan.

01:55:34.574 --> 01:55:35.641
Thank you, sister.

01:55:38.908 --> 01:55:39.908
Halime.

01:55:43.041 --> 01:55:45.074
The night when Gundogdu Bey stayed here

01:55:47.274 --> 01:55:49.108
I had a feeling that I was pregnant.

01:55:49.608 --> 01:55:50.641
Selcan!

01:55:52.141 --> 01:55:53.174
If God permits.

01:55:57.041 --> 01:56:02.008
From now on, I will fight for my son
not only for me.

01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:07.541
So the hope inside me can burgeon.

01:57:00.508 --> 01:57:01.508
Noyan went, son.

01:57:06.141 --> 01:57:10.008
From now on, my children are in danger
than ever before.

01:57:12.608 --> 01:57:15.308
We have to find a solution for that.

01:57:18.541 --> 01:57:19.574
Where is Sungur?

01:57:21.274 --> 01:57:23.274
Call him. I want to talk to you.

01:57:29.408 --> 01:57:30.474
Where is Sungur, son?

01:57:32.408 --> 01:57:33.408
He left, mother.

01:57:35.508 --> 01:57:36.541
Did he leave?

01:57:37.908 --> 01:57:38.941
Where did he go?

01:57:42.974 --> 01:57:44.508
How did you let him go?

01:57:46.974 --> 01:57:50.908
How can he kill Noyan by going after
so powerful Mongolian army?

01:57:51.508 --> 01:57:52.908
-Mother!
-How could you let such a thing

01:57:53.141 --> 01:57:54.408
happen, Gundogdu?
-Mother!

01:57:57.008 --> 01:58:01.574
You know that Noyan will not leave
neither me, you, Halime

01:58:02.274 --> 01:58:05.074
or her baby alive.

01:58:07.208 --> 01:58:12.941
Sungur did everything he can do
so we can release him for peace.

01:58:14.108 --> 01:58:16.174
He did this for our state and Alps.

01:58:17.241 --> 01:58:20.174
Since the very beginning
he determined to kill him.

01:58:22.274 --> 01:58:25.108
So, he did everything
he can do to release him.

01:59:17.174 --> 01:59:18.241
Come along, brothers.

02:00:05.474 --> 02:00:06.474
God!

02:00:08.041 --> 02:00:11.208
Let this plane tree embrace
whole world with its branches.

02:00:13.241 --> 02:00:14.441
Let it take roots.

02:00:15.608 --> 02:00:18.574
Let it take roots so our generation

02:00:19.441 --> 02:00:22.008
can spread your justice and name
to whole world.

02:00:23.974 --> 02:00:28.241
Let the fate of this plane tree
be our fate for this cause.

02:00:29.674 --> 02:00:30.674
Amen.

02:00:50.008 --> 02:00:52.541
We will make the sun our flag
and the sky our tent.

02:00:53.641 --> 02:00:56.108
We will ride our horses
to endless marquees.

02:00:57.541 --> 02:01:01.074
We will make our swords our lovers
and army our roses.

02:01:02.374 --> 02:01:06.374
Our stamp will flap as the flag of
justice in seven climates.

02:01:08.474 --> 02:01:12.708
We will carry our omniscient over
to the mountains and seas.

02:01:14.941 --> 02:01:16.008
God is greatest!

02:01:19.008 --> 02:01:20.174
God is greatest!

02:01:21.208 --> 02:01:22.374
God is greatest!

02:01:23.008 --> 02:01:24.174
God is greatest!

02:01:25.141 --> 02:01:26.274
God is greatest!
