12:22.747 --> 12:26.747
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

14:54.669 --> 14:58.903
You had to put up with roads with me
from the Caspian Sea...

14:59.403 --> 15:02.203
...to the border of Byzantine, Aktolgali.

15:12.603 --> 15:15.269
Every land that you step
with your hooves...

15:15.503 --> 15:19.736
...took us from lots of betrayers
and pain to another.

15:21.203 --> 15:27.269
I understood that the secret of fortune is
to fight for justice.

15:28.236 --> 15:32.269
The secret of fortune is hidden
in the lands that we found with justice.

15:33.603 --> 15:36.436
Thanks to God who showed it to me.

16:17.203 --> 16:19.803
They are ready to die for you Noyan.

16:35.003 --> 16:36.836
I came here for revenge.

16:37.769 --> 16:40.336
I came here to fight as a hero and die.

16:41.403 --> 16:48.369
I came here to give your reputation
that Ogeday Khan took from you.

17:11.269 --> 17:14.936
Those gold are yours, share them.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.469
If there is anyone who afraid of this
happy road...

17:21.969 --> 17:25.703
...he can take his share and leave.

17:28.903 --> 17:32.236
I will fulfill the secret duty
that Ogeday gave to me...

17:32.636 --> 17:34.803
...and I will cause Ertugrul's extinction.

17:37.203 --> 17:38.769
When the time comes...

17:39.569 --> 17:43.403
...I will give you the gold
that is in the palace of Sultan Aleaddin.

17:43.736 --> 17:45.669
I can give you one promise.

17:46.203 --> 17:49.236
You will all die as a honorable Mongol.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.303
For the revenge.

17:51.803 --> 17:53.303
For Genghis Khan.

17:53.369 --> 17:56.403
For the revenge! For Genghis Khan!

17:56.569 --> 18:01.669
For the revenge! For Genghis Khan!

18:01.936 --> 18:04.569
For the revenge! For Genghis Khan!

18:24.436 --> 18:26.436
<i>Come on, sit next to me.</i>

18:58.236 --> 19:02.403
<i>You went to various places,</i>
 <i>from the Caspian Sea...</i>

19:04.736 --> 19:07.803
<i>...to Ahlat, from Ahlat to Aleppo...</i>

19:09.736 --> 19:14.769
<i>...from Aleppo to Erzurum.</i>

19:17.669 --> 19:22.969
<i>In these places you go,</i>
 <i>you became the honor of Kayi tribe...</i>

19:24.669 --> 19:30.336
<i>...you became the pride of our tribe,</i>
 <i>and you became the flag of Islam.</i>

19:30.669 --> 19:32.569
<i>I just followed your way father...</i>

19:33.636 --> 19:35.303
<i>...and I will do the same hereafter.</i>

19:37.736 --> 19:41.536
<i>The roads that Kayi tribe...</i>

19:42.669 --> 19:49.569
<i>...and Oghuz was on exile showed</i>
 <i>its light to you son.</i>

19:51.503 --> 19:53.769
<i>Be a follower of that light.</i>

19:55.403 --> 19:59.569
<i>Thus you can be a new hope...</i>

20:00.936 --> 20:04.469
<i>...and you can open the doors of</i>
 <i>new world state for your descendants</i> .

20:06.469 --> 20:11.903
<i>The ones with you and behind you...</i>

20:13.669 --> 20:16.203
<i>...let them be happy with honor of this.</i>

20:20.936 --> 20:22.603
<i>From north to south.</i>

20:23.569 --> 20:25.303
<i>From east to west.</i>

20:26.903 --> 20:31.836
<i>A big oak tree with exile branches...</i>

20:32.836 --> 20:35.703
<i>...will be raised in this lands high</i>
 <i>and low.</i>

20:43.603 --> 20:47.603
It is the time to make homeland the lands
that our plane oak tree roots, father.

20:49.203 --> 20:50.769
May God not shame me.

20:52.503 --> 20:54.369
I will not shame you.

21:34.607 --> 21:36.540
Hayme Hatun and Gokce Hatun are coming!

Let us clean our tents, make meals and
let the smoke rise from our chimneys.

22:26.507 --> 22:29.740

22:30.307 --> 22:31.807

-If God permits.

22:48.373 --> 22:49.373
If God permits.

22:56.273 --> 22:58.140
May our nomad group be cleaned

22:58.607 --> 23:01.240

Amen.

23:38.140 --> 23:41.507
Happy spring!

23:42.040 --> 23:43.107
Amen.

23:46.273 --> 23:50.107
Let us start with spinning the wool
of the sheeps that are sheared.

23:52.607 --> 23:56.807
We commend our rug place to
Selcan Hatun and Halime Hatun.

23:57.607 --> 23:59.473
We will never misappropriate your trust.

24:00.007 --> 24:02.307
Your workplace is a mecca for us.

24:02.807 --> 24:04.007
Amen.

24:04.607 --> 24:08.007
Let us start working, in the name of God!

24:09.173 --> 24:10.173
Come on.

25:28.107 --> 25:29.173
Good luck with it, Turgut.

25:29.540 --> 25:33.207
Thank you, Bey. You allowed me
to keep my father's work going.

25:33.607 --> 25:35.040
May God bless you!

25:38.340 --> 25:40.773
Thanks to you, the soul of Wild Demir
will rest in peace.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.573
His soul will be rest in peace
in Byzantine border, Turgut.

25:46.773 --> 25:48.007
It is time for everybody to
learn about it.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.773
It is now the time, Ertugrul Bey.

25:52.573 --> 25:54.773
Did you examine Alps, Turgut?

25:55.340 --> 25:59.407
There are many Alps that will follow you
wherever you go Bey, with God's help.

26:00.540 --> 26:04.273
Kayi Alps say that they would go
anywhere, even to the end of the world.

26:04.707 --> 26:06.440
Yes, Bey. They say so.

26:07.473 --> 26:09.140
But Beys want peace, Ertugrul.

26:10.607 --> 26:12.673
And they fins peace in abbundance.

26:13.273 --> 26:16.240
The real war is starting now, brother.
If necessary...

26:16.407 --> 26:21.407
...we'll migrate with a handful of people,
just as our prohpet Mohammad.

26:22.707 --> 26:23.740
Alright, brother.

26:24.307 --> 26:26.573
With your permission, Ertugrul Bey...

26:26.773 --> 26:30.373
...I have an important matter to tell you
and Sungurtekin Bey.

26:35.073 --> 26:37.773
I will come to the healing tent,
you will tell me there.

26:39.107 --> 26:41.740
Thank you, Bey. Good luck with it, Turgut.

26:43.173 --> 26:45.007
-Thank you.
-Good luck with it, Turgut Alp.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.473
Thank you.

26:55.640 --> 26:57.040
How did you fire the oven, brother?

26:59.207 --> 27:00.473
Just as my father did.

27:01.373 --> 27:03.273
With the spark of The Nawruz fire, Bey.

27:03.707 --> 27:04.773
Thank you.

27:05.507 --> 27:10.240
May the iron thicken with the fire.
May the hammer and stithy shape up.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.640
Amen.

27:16.107 --> 27:18.640
Will not we forge in the fire of Nawruz?

27:21.607 --> 27:24.340
-As you please, Bey.
-Come on, in the name of God.

27:34.507 --> 27:35.573
In the name of God.

27:41.640 --> 27:42.673
God bless!

27:43.073 --> 27:46.140
May God discipline our enemies
in such a fire!

27:46.707 --> 27:47.740
Amen.

27:48.073 --> 27:50.340
Thus they can know their place with the
power of stithy.

27:51.107 --> 27:52.140
Amen.

27:52.707 --> 27:53.807
In the name of God!

27:55.007 --> 27:57.140
-God!
-In the name of God!

27:57.507 --> 27:59.307
-God!
-In the name of God!

27:59.740 --> 28:01.407
-God!
-In the name of God!

28:01.707 --> 28:03.240
-God!
-In the name of God!

28:03.440 --> 28:05.073
-God!
-In the name of God!

28:05.273 --> 28:06.773
-God!
-In the name of God!

28:07.140 --> 28:08.540
-God!
-In the name of God!

28:08.773 --> 28:10.407
-God!
-In the name of God!

28:10.740 --> 28:12.307
-God!
-In the name of God!

28:12.607 --> 28:14.207
-God!
-In the name of God!

28:14.473 --> 28:16.240
-God!
-In the name of God!

28:16.640 --> 28:18.307
-God!
-In the name of God!

29:44.740 --> 29:47.207
What is the matter, Artuk Bey?
What is it that you want to tell us?

29:47.573 --> 29:48.640
It is about Gundogdu Bey.

29:49.340 --> 29:51.340
I prevented the abscess
to poison his blood.

29:51.773 --> 29:53.740
But this abscess will give no quarter.

29:55.473 --> 29:57.640
How much longer will my brother's
condition go on like this?

29:58.240 --> 29:59.340
God knows that, Bey.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.673
But the matter is much deeper.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.173
What is the matter, Artuk Bey?

30:05.340 --> 30:09.773
I do not know when Gundogdu Bey's arm will
recover and head up to Alps again, Bey.

30:10.440 --> 30:16.407
In this condition, if he heads them,
he will harm both himself and the Alps.

30:17.340 --> 30:18.573
What can we do, Artuk Bey?

30:19.273 --> 30:20.307
Nothing, Bey.

30:21.407 --> 30:25.073
But there is a very succesful doctor in
Erzurum whom I trust in his skills.

30:25.573 --> 30:28.407
He better examine his harm
within a short time.

30:34.273 --> 30:36.073
My brother should hear it
from my mother.

30:36.607 --> 30:38.007
And when it comes to his duty...

30:39.307 --> 30:43.340
...Alps cannot be left without a leader.
I know, the danger is close.

31:16.207 --> 31:17.207
Stop!

32:37.773 --> 32:40.507
Is this the man that you would like
to introduce me, Ameer Almighty?

32:42.040 --> 32:43.040
Yes.

32:43.207 --> 32:45.640
<i>The head of Noyan</i>

32:46.107 --> 32:52.073
<i>who martyrised many of our brothers,</i>
 <i>is at your feet, thank God!</i>

33:01.073 --> 33:02.073
Noyan.

33:20.207 --> 33:21.640
Do not be afraid of me, Goncagul Hatun.

33:25.273 --> 33:28.040
I know that we both have the same goal.

33:31.007 --> 33:35.273
Until the last drop of blood of
Ertugrul gets off his veins...

33:35.473 --> 33:38.740
...you'll devote your life
to this case with this man, Goncagul.

33:43.673 --> 33:47.540
It is obvious that the ominous seal
which caused the death of my father...

33:48.107 --> 33:49.440
...did not touch you, Noyan.

33:50.473 --> 33:53.473
Which war is as crueal as the politics,
Goncagul Hatun?

33:54.807 --> 33:56.307
Politics is over now.

33:57.440 --> 33:58.673
It is time for blood.

34:06.073 --> 34:10.640
The hate that preys on your mind, was not
enough to leave your beautiful face...

34:15.040 --> 34:16.173
...-in shade, Goncagul Hatun.
-What do you want from me?

34:16.807 --> 34:19.607
We need to you spy on these two
nomad groups...

34:19.807 --> 34:23.440
...which have clamped together thanks to
your father's headless corpse.

34:24.740 --> 34:28.540
Thus we will be alleviated with the
help of the blood of our enemies.

34:29.140 --> 34:30.673
My heart does not need to be refreshed.

34:32.173 --> 34:34.573
Instead, it has the need to burn away both
those nomad groups.

34:39.707 --> 34:42.440
I will give you what you want.
And what's more is, I will do it tonight.

34:48.340 --> 34:50.340
If we are done here,
I would like to leave now.

34:53.740 --> 34:54.740
Excuse me.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.207
She is also brave aside of her beauty.

35:11.173 --> 35:12.807
I wandered various lands but
I have never seen someone like her.

35:13.273 --> 35:17.040
She is clever. If God permits,
after everything is over...

35:18.007 --> 35:20.073
...I will take her to my palace
to take service with me.

35:22.073 --> 35:25.373
I can not stand such a women to be wasted
in your palace, Kobek.

35:26.073 --> 35:27.173
I think you are impressed by her.

35:31.007 --> 35:32.007
Yes, very much.

35:35.307 --> 35:36.740
So come on, steal her heart

35:38.140 --> 35:41.440
But do not forget, you will not
come to my headquarters from now on.

35:42.207 --> 35:45.540
If we will meet, here is our new
meeting place.

36:18.007 --> 36:19.106
God bless you!

36:19.573 --> 36:22.106
You look like fresh spring flowers
just like your name.

36:24.340 --> 36:25.540
They are so beautiful.

36:26.340 --> 36:27.507
Thank you, Gokce Hatun.

36:28.673 --> 36:31.273
May God bless you and Tugtekin Bey.

36:34.107 --> 36:35.707
You deserve everything, Banu Cicek.

36:36.773 --> 36:39.673
I hope you will be happy with Dogan Alp
for the rest of your life.

36:40.273 --> 36:42.607
May God give you beautiful children.

36:42.807 --> 36:44.240
I hope so, Selcan Hatun.

36:44.673 --> 36:47.573
I hope our children to grow old together.

36:48.207 --> 36:53.340
Both Gokce Hatun's and Mother Hayme's
state tents may glow with children.

37:04.073 --> 37:05.073
Gokce Hatun.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.573
Are you alright?

37:11.340 --> 37:12.340
I am fine.

37:15.440 --> 37:16.440
I...

37:17.807 --> 37:19.507
I have things to take care of.

37:20.573 --> 37:22.407
If God is willing,
I will see you at diner.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.440
Selcan Hatun, did I say something wrong?

37:34.407 --> 37:35.407
No way.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.573
I think it is because of joy.

37:38.407 --> 37:39.607
When she saw you such happy...

37:40.373 --> 37:41.707
Come on, let's try your bonnet.

37:43.407 --> 37:44.473
It will also suit you well.

37:58.507 --> 38:01.607
Hatuns, put the chest between the beds
of Yigit Alp and Dundar Bey.

38:06.807 --> 38:10.073
And bring the chest of Sungurtekin Bey
from Mother Hayme's state tent...

38:10.273 --> 38:11.807
...and put it right there.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.440
But be careful, it is a little heavy.

38:15.373 --> 38:16.440
God bless you.

38:25.273 --> 38:26.273
<i>May I come in?</i>

38:32.140 --> 38:33.240
Welcome, Ertugrul Bey.

38:35.173 --> 38:36.207
Thank you, Halime Sultan.

38:38.107 --> 38:40.707
-It is obvious that you glamourized here.
-Do you like it?

38:41.773 --> 38:43.373
Is it possible for you
to make something bad?

38:44.707 --> 38:47.207
Ertugrul Bey, I do not know how I will
endure until tomorrow.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.507
I have missed Yigit and Dundar so much.

38:50.440 --> 38:51.773
Longing is over now, Halime Sultan.

38:52.473 --> 38:56.607
When our child is born, it's uncle will be
here just as my brothers, if God permits.

38:57.373 --> 38:59.373
-This is what makes me happy.
-If God permits.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.440
Ertugrul Bey, I know that the
migration time is near.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.807
I hope we will not need to be separated...

39:11.607 --> 39:13.807
...from our beloved ones
when reach The Byzantium border.

39:14.473 --> 39:18.473
In this holly journey, it's not separation
that falls to our share. Instead, it is...

39:19.540 --> 39:21.773
...keeping our state tent and nomad group
together. And it is our duty to do...

39:23.040 --> 39:25.573
...whatever it takes. We will see that,
when we migrate together, Halime Sultan.

39:27.273 --> 39:30.440
Let's go now. It is Nawruz.
My mother waits for us.

39:55.373 --> 39:56.373
Bey!

40:01.240 --> 40:03.173
I could not succeed to get dressed
on my own.

40:05.073 --> 40:06.207
I can help you.

40:06.773 --> 40:09.473
No, Selcan! I do not need help.

40:11.407 --> 40:14.740
It is nawruz, Bey. Your mother
wants you by her side.

40:15.407 --> 40:17.107
Your Alps and your brothers too.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.740
I do not want to appear before people
under these conditions, Selcan.

40:23.073 --> 40:24.240
I do not know what I do anymore.

40:26.307 --> 40:28.173
I tortured you and myself very much.

40:28.573 --> 40:29.640
Do not talk like this.

40:31.207 --> 40:32.240
No, Selcan, no.

40:34.173 --> 40:35.707
I cannot appear before Alps
in this situation.

40:36.207 --> 40:37.373
How long will it take for me to recover?

40:39.507 --> 40:41.473
What will I do if something happens
to our nomad group?

40:44.407 --> 40:47.573
Let me help you. It is Nawruz.

40:49.173 --> 40:50.173
No, Selcan, no.

40:51.607 --> 40:53.673
I do not want to appear before Alps
in this situation.

40:54.740 --> 40:56.440
They should not see me like this.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.807
May our sustenance overflow.
May our joy be permanent.

41:19.240 --> 41:24.607
May our nomad groub be merry.
Come here child, take it.

41:26.573 --> 41:27.573
Welcome, my dear.

41:49.307 --> 41:50.307
Please.

41:50.673 --> 41:52.040
Bring it to me. Bring it.

42:10.740 --> 42:13.440
May all the evil burn with this
Nawruz fire!

42:14.140 --> 42:17.040
May the grudge inside of us be cleaned up
with the Nawruz fire!

42:17.440 --> 42:18.707
May the cruelty in the world
come to an end!

42:19.373 --> 42:22.740
May our nomad group be filled with peace!
Happy nawruz!

42:23.607 --> 42:25.373
-Amen!
-Amen!

42:47.607 --> 42:52.073
Move! Turali Alp is coming!

42:53.073 --> 42:55.073
He is coming to be circumcised!

42:56.440 --> 42:59.107
He is coming to be a brave man!

43:00.573 --> 43:02.140
He will be a real man!

43:18.707 --> 43:20.740
Come on, my lad!

43:21.440 --> 43:22.573
God!

43:24.607 --> 43:26.640
Turali, it is time to be an Alp.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.673
I will be an Alp like you, Ertugrul Bey.

43:32.140 --> 43:34.440
-God bless you!
-God bless you!

43:40.440 --> 43:41.540
God bless you!

43:48.407 --> 43:51.273
Turali, I have a present for you.

43:59.673 --> 44:00.673
Take it.

44:09.807 --> 44:11.607
It is exactly the gift that I
wanted to have.

44:12.173 --> 44:14.707
It is bigger than the present
of Artuk Bey.

44:15.540 --> 44:18.173
I wish Wild Demir could make my present.

44:31.740 --> 44:34.707
Turali Alp, if you are ready, let's start.

44:37.140 --> 44:38.473
Will I get hurt so much, Artuk Bey?

44:39.740 --> 44:42.373
It is not much for a brave man like you.

44:50.340 --> 44:51.407
Then, let's start.

44:59.707 --> 45:02.040
Come on. Come on.

45:11.540 --> 45:13.240
In the name of God!

45:18.407 --> 45:19.640
Come on!

45:26.540 --> 45:27.673
God bless!

45:31.640 --> 45:33.040
Come on!

46:20.407 --> 46:21.407
Come on!

47:08.240 --> 47:09.240
Come on!

47:38.773 --> 47:40.807
Our nomad group already deserved
such a joviality.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.307
Our people were longing for peace.

47:46.340 --> 47:48.007
I hope this peace will be permanent.

47:50.240 --> 47:53.073
-But...
-I also think what you think, brother.

47:56.107 --> 47:57.140
Goncagul escaped.

47:58.540 --> 48:00.440
It is not certain when will Noyan appear.

48:01.473 --> 48:07.240
Sadettin Kobek is like a rabid dog.
Our nomad groups are under threat.

48:09.207 --> 48:10.573
We need to be ready for war, brother.

48:12.473 --> 48:14.240
This is exactly what I wanted to tell you,
brother.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.007
This silence is not a good sign.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.473
It seems that our nomad group will deal
with various troubles.

48:23.440 --> 48:24.740
Our Alps do not have a leader.

48:26.540 --> 48:29.673
If my brother quits The Head Alp
position...

48:32.107 --> 48:33.573
...I want you to take over his duty.

48:39.673 --> 48:41.140
Go on wrestlers!

48:42.140 --> 48:43.407
Go on! Go on!

48:43.607 --> 48:44.773
Go on wrestlers!

49:29.207 --> 49:31.407
May God give you a long life,
Banu Cicek Hatun!

49:54.740 --> 49:56.273
Long live, Banu Cicek Hatun!

49:57.607 --> 49:59.607
Long live Banu Cicek! Long live!

49:59.807 --> 50:02.473
-Banu Cicek won.
-Long live Banu Cicek!

50:03.440 --> 50:07.007
-Long Live!
-God bless you! God bless!

50:11.040 --> 50:12.073
God bless!

50:13.207 --> 50:14.407
God bless you all.

50:15.707 --> 50:19.807
Banu Cicek did not only win this
contest...

50:21.240 --> 50:25.273
...but also risked her life to get
rid of the betrayers...

50:26.673 --> 50:28.307
...that have beeen pestered to
our nomad group.

50:35.407 --> 50:36.673
This is for you, Banu Cicek.

50:38.007 --> 50:39.007
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

50:43.740 --> 50:47.573
We learned to risk our lives when
needed, from the best. From You.

50:48.240 --> 50:53.073
If there is a hero, it is our elders like
you who tought us our morals.

51:00.040 --> 51:01.707
May God bestow you to
your father and mother.

51:02.207 --> 51:05.640
-May God give you children just like you.
-Amen.

51:06.473 --> 51:08.273
God bless! God bless!

51:08.607 --> 51:10.807
May God give everybody a child like you.

51:11.807 --> 51:14.373
-God bless her!
-Look at her and see!

51:35.373 --> 51:37.173
-God bless!
-God bless!

51:39.240 --> 51:40.340
God bless! God bless!

51:44.407 --> 51:45.407
Ertugrul Bey!

51:46.373 --> 51:47.473
Yes, Tugtekin Bey.

51:48.007 --> 51:50.173
Come on, pick an Alp
that you trust to his fists...

51:51.673 --> 51:53.507
...thus we see whose Alp one is stronger.

51:55.307 --> 51:56.607
As you please, Tugtekin Bey.

51:57.607 --> 51:58.673
Pick your Alp.

51:59.007 --> 52:01.307
I choose Bogac. Who do you choose?

52:04.573 --> 52:06.573
Choose me, Bey, choose me!

52:12.073 --> 52:13.073
Go out there, Bamsi!

52:14.240 --> 52:15.273
Thank you, Bey!

52:18.307 --> 52:21.340
Bogac! Bogac! Bogac!

52:26.307 --> 52:27.307
Go Bogac!

52:29.140 --> 52:31.207
Come on! Come on my lad!

52:33.473 --> 52:34.507
Go Bogac!

52:35.273 --> 52:37.673
Bogac! Bogac! Bogac!

53:12.073 --> 53:13.173
Come on, Bogac!

53:18.007 --> 53:19.706
Go on Bamsi, go on!

53:44.206 --> 53:45.206
Come on!

54:02.107 --> 54:03.107
Come on!

54:10.207 --> 54:11.340
God bless!

54:15.107 --> 54:16.407
God!

54:35.407 --> 54:36.473
Come on, brother!

54:47.007 --> 54:48.107
Go on, Bogac!

54:48.307 --> 54:49.473
Go on!

54:55.307 --> 54:57.640
Bamsi! Bamsi! Bamsi!

55:10.407 --> 55:11.773
Come on, Bamsi!

55:16.040 --> 55:17.207
Come on!

55:23.640 --> 55:24.773
Come on, Bamsi!

55:27.073 --> 55:28.107
Come on!

55:40.107 --> 55:41.573
-Surrender, brother!
-No!

55:42.040 --> 55:45.040
-Give in, brother!
-No!

55:45.507 --> 55:47.740
-Give in brother!
-No!

55:48.140 --> 55:50.307
Brother!

55:51.107 --> 55:52.107
I surrender!

56:02.773 --> 56:05.307
Bamsi! Bamsi! Bamsi!

56:12.140 --> 56:14.773
Where are you going, brother?
You will win the next time!

56:28.240 --> 56:29.240
My lad!

56:34.373 --> 56:35.373
Bamsi Alp.

56:36.740 --> 56:39.240
You proved what a strong man
you are even in this ring.

56:46.307 --> 56:50.407
This quiver is the prize of your success.

56:51.807 --> 56:52.807
Thank you, Bey.

56:53.640 --> 56:54.640
Bamsi Alp!

58:08.307 --> 58:11.573
What is wrong with you In such a merry
day?

58:13.673 --> 58:16.440
If you permit mother, my brother and I
want to talk to you about something.

58:21.073 --> 58:22.107
What happened?

58:23.407 --> 58:28.740
Hayme Hatun, Gundogdu Bey's illness
is beyond my knowledge.

58:32.773 --> 58:34.240
What are you saying, Artuk Bey?

58:34.707 --> 58:38.473
Gundogdu Bey needs to go to Erzurum
and recover there as soon as possible.

58:41.473 --> 58:43.507
Under these conditions, for my brother
to continue being the Head Alp...

58:44.040 --> 58:45.607
...will cause weakness
in the nomad group.

58:48.707 --> 58:52.173
We need to solve this before
no one hears about it, mother.

59:17.507 --> 59:18.507
Thank you.

59:19.607 --> 59:21.173
Now leave me alone, Selcan.

59:22.240 --> 59:23.607
-Bey!
-Selcan.

59:46.307 --> 59:47.340
God!

59:51.173 --> 59:53.040
Please do not test me more
with this pain.

59:55.140 --> 59:56.440
Take my life and save me.

01:00:10.279 --> 01:00:13.179
May God heal my Bey.

01:00:20.746 --> 01:00:22.179
-Selcan Hatun.
-Yes.

01:00:22.746 --> 01:00:24.279
Gokce Hatun wants to see
you in her state tent.

01:00:26.113 --> 01:00:27.113
I am coming.

01:01:12.946 --> 01:01:14.713
You’ve asked for me to come
to visit you, Gokce Hatun.

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:24.179
Sister!

01:01:25.213 --> 01:01:26.213
Gokce!

01:01:28.213 --> 01:01:29.979
What happened to you?
Tell me. What is this?

01:01:30.513 --> 01:01:31.513
Aytolun!

01:01:32.279 --> 01:01:33.779
What happened to that infernal woman?

01:01:34.846 --> 01:01:36.179
She learnt everything, sister.

01:01:36.979 --> 01:01:38.079
What did she learn?

01:01:38.913 --> 01:01:41.213
Everything. She told to Tugtekin Bey.

01:01:42.046 --> 01:01:45.279
Gokce, tell me. What did she tell?

01:01:49.713 --> 01:01:51.946
She told, I was in love with
Ertugrul Bey once upon a time...

01:01:54.213 --> 01:01:58.946
...how I got stabbed, she told
everything to Tugtekin Bey.

01:02:03.946 --> 01:02:06.313
I told him I could not have a child.

01:02:07.313 --> 01:02:08.346
Gokce!

01:02:09.413 --> 01:02:11.713
Sister! He does not
look into my eyes!

01:02:12.946 --> 01:02:15.879
He does not talk with
me anymore! -Well. Well.

01:02:18.979 --> 01:02:22.279
Sister, he told me that I lied,
please! He told me that I tricked!

01:02:24.113 --> 01:02:26.879
He told me that I slept with
him even I love Ertugrul!

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:32.379
He told me that I gave him hope
knowing that I cannot give him a child.

01:02:35.513 --> 01:02:36.513
Sister!

01:02:37.513 --> 01:02:38.813
Sister, what will I do?

01:02:40.046 --> 01:02:41.846
Sister, please, I am
begging you, please help me!

01:02:43.079 --> 01:02:46.979
Sister, please show me a
way! -Alright, Gokce. Alright!

01:02:53.146 --> 01:02:54.179
Alright.

01:04:06.979 --> 01:04:08.946
I will take your revenge, aunt.

01:04:56.346 --> 01:04:59.113
No one can defeat me!
No one can defeat me!

01:05:13.446 --> 01:05:14.446
Do not even try!

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:20.513
I did not come here to kill you. I
came here to give you a lot of gold.

01:05:25.013 --> 01:05:26.113
No one can buy me.

01:05:27.413 --> 01:05:29.713
A woman can never buy me.

01:05:48.313 --> 01:05:50.446
I know the service you
have provided to my father

01:05:50.879 --> 01:05:52.179
for the less of this, Bogac Alp.

01:05:53.846 --> 01:05:54.879
What do you want from me?

01:05:55.479 --> 01:05:56.479
Ertugrul!

01:06:02.479 --> 01:06:05.113
You cannot give me what
I want, Goncagul Hatun.

01:06:06.113 --> 01:06:09.179
Do you want more gold? Or a position?

01:06:11.146 --> 01:06:12.713
You cannot give me those

01:06:12.779 --> 01:06:16.246
while Beys and Alps of
two nomad groups are following you.

01:06:17.713 --> 01:06:19.046
They will find you and kill you.

01:06:20.013 --> 01:06:24.213
I know a person that can give
more than you want, Bogac Alp.

01:06:31.913 --> 01:06:34.279
It is not about gold or position.

01:06:35.046 --> 01:06:38.346
It is about if you
have courage or not.

01:07:03.513 --> 01:07:04.779
Can I come in, son?

01:07:05.346 --> 01:07:06.946
Of course mom, come in.

01:07:21.513 --> 01:07:22.513
How are you?

01:07:23.413 --> 01:07:24.479
How can I be, mom?

01:07:25.513 --> 01:07:29.346
I do not have power even to shoot
arrows to the enemy or to hold a quiver.

01:07:31.879 --> 01:07:34.813
I feel like I am carrying the carrion
of an animal that I do not want.

01:07:36.013 --> 01:07:37.046
Gondogdu.

01:07:37.246 --> 01:07:42.213
This illness will take my life
just as it took my father's life.

01:07:44.979 --> 01:07:47.713
Please do not talk like this, son.
For god's sake, do not talk like this.

01:07:53.813 --> 01:07:56.213
Today I was embarrassed
In front of Alps, mom.

01:07:57.179 --> 01:07:59.379
I wanted someone to
cut my arm and save me.

01:08:00.846 --> 01:08:01.979
How will this end up?

01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:06.179
Artuk Bey said that he
detoxicated the poison in my arm

01:08:07.113 --> 01:08:08.379
but he is not
explaining the situation.

01:08:11.146 --> 01:08:14.313
Artuk Bey wants us to go
Erzurum as soon as possible.

01:08:15.913 --> 01:08:20.346
You have a troublesome thorn abscess that
is beyond his knowledge of medicine, son.

01:08:21.179 --> 01:08:23.079
A wise doctor will
wait for us therein.

01:08:25.013 --> 01:08:27.979
Why did he tell this
to you, not to me?

01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:31.513
Because it is not
only about your arm.

01:08:34.013 --> 01:08:35.013
What is it about?

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:39.079
It is about the duty that
two nomad groups gave to you.

01:08:42.213 --> 01:08:44.113
You have to quit being
the head of the Alps, son.

01:08:46.779 --> 01:08:50.046
Tomorrow I will ask for two nomad
groups to gather headquarters.

01:08:51.379 --> 01:08:53.146
I do not want to debilitate Alps.

01:08:54.813 --> 01:08:56.046
And you don't want it as well.

01:08:57.013 --> 01:08:58.179
Of course I do not want, mom.

01:09:00.246 --> 01:09:03.746
If you permit, I will tell my
decision in the headquarters tomorrow.

01:09:05.846 --> 01:09:08.179
I wish to keep it among three of us.

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:18.246
Blood!

01:10:19.113 --> 01:10:21.246
Everywhere will be blood!

01:10:24.713 --> 01:10:25.746
Blood!

01:10:27.146 --> 01:10:31.213
Blood will clean up the
grunge inside you, Noyan!

01:10:35.079 --> 01:10:38.879
Mountains will be blessed

01:10:40.879 --> 01:10:42.413
with  the blood you
put under each tree!

01:11:01.379 --> 01:11:04.279
Blood, blessed blood!

01:11:34.346 --> 01:11:36.479
You will smell both scents

01:11:38.079 --> 01:11:40.746
that you like the most.

01:11:43.313 --> 01:11:44.979
The scent of blood and woman.

01:13:20.046 --> 01:13:26.479
This woman will give you that blessed
blood that you will drink thirstily.

01:13:30.813 --> 01:13:31.913
She will give it!

01:13:33.279 --> 01:13:34.346
She will give it!

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.279
She will give it!

01:13:51.913 --> 01:13:52.913
Noyan!

01:15:58.179 --> 01:15:59.246
What happened, brother?

01:16:02.113 --> 01:16:04.979
Brothers, I could not
decide what to wear tonight

01:16:05.713 --> 01:16:08.513
while asking for the girl's hand in
marriage. Should I wear this or that one?

01:16:13.279 --> 01:16:15.079
You’d better wear my armor!

01:16:18.313 --> 01:16:20.313
Brother, you are not going to war.

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.379
Wear something clean, it is enough.

01:16:29.013 --> 01:16:32.879
Thing called as love
is such a weird thing.

01:16:35.746 --> 01:16:36.846
Take shelter, brother.

01:16:38.346 --> 01:16:40.479
The big philosopher’s
started talking again.

01:16:44.913 --> 01:16:48.313
Brother, when I look at Dogan brother

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:51.013
I think that love is
such a valuable thing.

01:16:51.513 --> 01:16:56.513
Like the Luna Moth
flying around the Nawruz fire.

01:17:07.513 --> 01:17:12.713
Brother, love is
such a valuable thing.

01:17:13.313 --> 01:17:16.513
I swear, I saw it and understood it.

01:17:18.146 --> 01:17:22.013
Brothers, look what
happened to brother Dogan.

01:17:22.813 --> 01:17:24.879
Almighty God, you are so powerful.

01:17:28.846 --> 01:17:31.813
Say what you want so say.
Say a word and let us listen.

01:17:35.413 --> 01:17:38.446
Brother, the love of a
brave man to his woman

01:17:39.879 --> 01:17:44.813
is like a Luna moth which does not flee
from fire although it knows it will burn.

01:17:45.913 --> 01:17:48.179
It is like the love of God.

01:17:51.079 --> 01:17:53.013
And I am asking you

01:17:54.479 --> 01:17:57.179
if anyone who does not have love  for
any human being, can he love his God?

01:18:05.746 --> 01:18:07.513
I swear, love is something valuable.

01:18:08.779 --> 01:18:11.513
It even encouraged
Bamsi to talk. Well done.

01:18:16.746 --> 01:18:20.513
Well brother Bamsi, tell us,
when will you fall in love?

01:18:21.513 --> 01:18:23.813
Yes, come on, tell us.

01:18:25.879 --> 01:18:27.913
No brothers, no.

01:18:28.379 --> 01:18:34.846
Mine is Shahada love, my woman
is my sword, say it never again.

01:18:35.246 --> 01:18:37.313
Say it never again. Never
say it again, brothers.

01:18:43.146 --> 01:18:44.213
Say it never again.

01:18:45.246 --> 01:18:46.313
Say it never again.

01:18:47.379 --> 01:18:49.746
Never say it again, brothers.
-Never again okay, never again.

01:19:13.046 --> 01:19:14.746
Thank God who gave you to me.

01:19:17.013 --> 01:19:21.946
From now on, there is only one
obstacle to hug you and our baby.

01:19:23.046 --> 01:19:24.279
What are you saying, Gundogdu?

01:19:25.879 --> 01:19:28.179
I need to get rid of
this trouble, right away.

01:19:29.746 --> 01:19:32.446
-I hope, God will heal you.
-If God permits, Hatun.

01:19:34.113 --> 01:19:38.213
Artuk Bey said that my
remedy is in Erzurum.

01:19:39.279 --> 01:19:41.079
I will go to Erzurum with my
mother as soon as possible.

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:45.979
Do not leave me here alone,
Bey. Take me with you.

01:19:47.013 --> 01:19:48.113
No way, Selcan.

01:19:48.713 --> 01:19:51.179
You are pregnant, you cannot
come. I will go with my mother.

01:19:52.046 --> 01:19:53.713
Please do not go without me.

01:19:54.246 --> 01:19:57.046
How can I wait you therein? I will
be thinking about you all that time.

01:19:57.213 --> 01:20:00.313
How can you travel all that
road on horseback, Selcan?

01:20:03.246 --> 01:20:04.946
We do not want to
be sad one more time.

01:20:07.213 --> 01:20:11.113
Let's not make my mother
and Tugtekin Bey wait more.

01:20:49.013 --> 01:20:50.379
How long will it take, Bey?

01:21:03.713 --> 01:21:04.713
Bey.

01:21:06.079 --> 01:21:07.113
Take my life...

01:21:11.379 --> 01:21:12.479
...or look at my face.

01:21:17.279 --> 01:21:18.479
Please, tell me something.

01:21:21.246 --> 01:21:22.846
Do not make me live with this shame.

01:21:28.046 --> 01:21:29.846
I took you from Mother Hayme's nomad tent.

01:21:31.279 --> 01:21:32.346
I took you to my tent.

01:21:34.379 --> 01:21:36.979
I am responsible from your
life and your honor until I die.

01:21:38.979 --> 01:21:40.346
Beyond is your problem.

01:21:43.146 --> 01:21:46.846
Your shame, your destiny.

01:21:47.246 --> 01:21:49.479
Mother Hayme is coming with
her sons and her brides, Bey.

01:22:24.379 --> 01:22:26.246
Welcome, Mother Hayme.

01:22:27.246 --> 01:22:28.446
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey.

01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:32.313
Welcome, Mother Hayme.

01:22:33.846 --> 01:22:34.846
Welcome.

01:22:37.779 --> 01:22:38.913
Thank you, Gokce Hatun.

01:22:40.413 --> 01:22:41.413
Come inside.

01:22:44.313 --> 01:22:45.779
-Welcome, Bey.
-Welcome, Ertugrul Bey.

01:22:48.913 --> 01:22:49.913
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey.

01:23:06.813 --> 01:23:07.813
Tugtekin Bey.

01:23:08.846 --> 01:23:09.846
Welcome.

01:23:12.313 --> 01:23:13.346
Come in. -Thank you.

01:23:17.046 --> 01:23:18.879
-Tugtekin Bey.
-Halime Sultan.

01:23:20.213 --> 01:23:21.246
Gokce Hatun.

01:23:23.846 --> 01:23:24.879
Welcome.

01:23:25.846 --> 01:23:26.846
Thank you.

01:23:42.113 --> 01:23:43.113
Welcome.

01:23:44.813 --> 01:23:45.813
Welcome.

01:24:07.379 --> 01:24:08.379
Almighty Ameer!

01:24:08.746 --> 01:24:12.813
Goncagul Hatun wants to come to
your presence with a Dodurga Alp.

01:24:15.013 --> 01:24:16.046
She may come.

01:24:38.479 --> 01:24:39.513
Why are you here?

01:24:43.113 --> 01:24:48.779
I learnt from Gumustekin Bey to stand by
the state on no account, Ameer Almighty.

01:24:50.246 --> 01:24:52.446
And the slanders of Ertugrul Bey?

01:24:54.279 --> 01:24:55.746
What do you think about them?

01:24:56.313 --> 01:24:58.913
What I think is not
important, Hazrat Ameer.

01:24:59.346 --> 01:25:01.979
The important thing
is how I’ll serve you.

01:25:03.246 --> 01:25:06.213
I know that you are such a precious Ameer
that you will not let the people involve

01:25:07.246 --> 01:25:09.413
in the fight of Beys, Ameer Almighty.

01:25:21.413 --> 01:25:25.746
I am happy to see your
bond to your state, child.

01:25:26.379 --> 01:25:30.279
Bogac Alp has precious news for you.

01:25:30.946 --> 01:25:31.946
Really?

01:25:33.813 --> 01:25:34.813
What is it?

01:25:35.479 --> 01:25:38.813
Dundar Bey who is the
brother of Ertugrul Bey

01:25:39.246 --> 01:25:42.413
and Shahzada Yigit who is
the brother of Halime Sultan

01:25:43.179 --> 01:25:44.413
are about to come to the nomad group.

01:25:45.146 --> 01:25:46.246
How did you learn this?

01:25:46.746 --> 01:25:50.479
I know that Halime Sultan is making
preparations for a tent for two children.

01:26:01.279 --> 01:26:04.246
My loyalty to you will not be
limited with this, Ameer Almighty.

01:26:04.946 --> 01:26:07.046
You will understand this with
each news I brought to you.

01:26:18.379 --> 01:26:20.513
I punish every infidelity...

01:26:23.113 --> 01:26:26.813
...but I reward every loyalty.

01:26:28.946 --> 01:26:30.113
Do you understand me?

01:26:32.846 --> 01:26:34.113
I understand you, Ameer Almighty.

01:26:36.146 --> 01:26:37.146
Good.

01:26:39.146 --> 01:26:41.413
Now go and be my eyes and
ears in the nomad group.

01:26:57.179 --> 01:27:00.379
Do you know the importance of the
news that he gave, Goncagul Hatun?

01:27:01.213 --> 01:27:06.813
The sons of Sultan Aleaddin
Shazada Izzettin and Shazada Husrev.

01:27:07.813 --> 01:27:10.346
These two children are the
only heir of Seljukian throne.

01:27:10.746 --> 01:27:15.113
What can be more important
than this, Ameer Almighty?

01:27:17.479 --> 01:27:20.713
You are as clever as your father.

01:27:21.946 --> 01:27:23.913
But let me remind you something.

01:27:25.713 --> 01:27:28.946
Do not forget that you’re
entering into the politics game.

01:27:29.946 --> 01:27:34.213
To take your revenge and survive

01:27:35.713 --> 01:27:37.446
you need my help, Goncagul Hatun.

01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:41.413
I know, Ameer Almighty. I know.

01:27:43.113 --> 01:27:48.379
My only aim is to take revenge
of my father and my aunt.

01:28:35.179 --> 01:28:38.379
Ameer Almighty! Merchant
Abdullah wants to see you.

01:28:41.913 --> 01:28:42.913
Make him wait.

01:28:47.813 --> 01:28:48.846
Noyan came.

01:28:49.446 --> 01:28:52.446
I told him not to come but
he did not listen to me.

01:28:53.046 --> 01:28:54.079
Noyan?

01:28:55.013 --> 01:28:56.113
What does he want?

01:28:57.413 --> 01:28:59.413
-You.
-Me?

01:29:01.246 --> 01:29:06.813
I know how you stole Gundogdu's
heart and how you trapped him.

01:29:08.379 --> 01:29:11.379
Do you want me to behave that man
that Ogeday threw him out from his army

01:29:12.146 --> 01:29:15.713
like I behaved to
Gundogdu, Ameer Almighty?

01:29:16.113 --> 01:29:19.279
I know, Noyan is wild.

01:29:20.246 --> 01:29:22.379
But he is not as smart as you.

01:29:24.113 --> 01:29:26.213
My confidence in your
intelligence is absolute.

01:29:28.879 --> 01:29:33.113
If you be his frailty, this
will  help both you and me.

01:29:34.813 --> 01:29:37.913
I know after you took
the seal from my father

01:29:38.879 --> 01:29:42.946
you gave it to Tangut to
kill Noyan, Hazrat Almighty.

01:29:43.913 --> 01:29:48.879
After Noyan is done with Ertugrul
he will want to kill you immediately.

01:29:50.246 --> 01:29:54.813
Neither his scarce mind nor power
is enough for this. Don’t worry.

01:29:55.979 --> 01:30:02.213
Act to Noyan as you acted to
Gundogdu to indulge our wishes.

01:30:03.146 --> 01:30:07.446
Do whatever you can to be his frailty

01:30:08.246 --> 01:30:09.513
and even get into his den.

01:30:11.813 --> 01:30:12.846
Do you understand me?

01:30:16.713 --> 01:30:17.713
Yes.

01:30:19.513 --> 01:30:20.513
Good.

01:30:59.746 --> 01:31:02.046
The Alps that I sent to look for
Goncagul came back to the nomad group.

01:31:05.146 --> 01:31:06.146
Is there any news?

01:31:07.013 --> 01:31:08.279
Unfortunately, they
could not chase her down.

01:31:10.179 --> 01:31:11.879
She will get what she deserves soon.

01:31:13.913 --> 01:31:16.479
Let's not foul this beautiful night
with the name of that ominous woman.

01:31:17.046 --> 01:31:18.213
You are right, Ertugrul Bey.

01:31:24.046 --> 01:31:26.346
How is your arm, Gundogdu Bey?

01:31:28.313 --> 01:31:30.479
-If God permits, it will be better.
-If God permits.

01:31:30.913 --> 01:31:31.913
If God permits.

01:31:38.513 --> 01:31:41.113
Tugtekin Bey, Alps showed
their abilities in nawruz.

01:31:42.513 --> 01:31:46.079
Bamsi Alp brought Bogac
Alp to his knees, Dogan Alp.

01:31:47.046 --> 01:31:49.446
Which son of Adam can take a stand
against Bamsi Alp, Tugtekin Bey?

01:31:51.479 --> 01:31:53.413
I hope, Bogac will
forget this defeat.

01:31:54.913 --> 01:31:56.113
Of course he will,
what else can he do?

01:31:57.746 --> 01:31:59.113
And our all Alps are one, right?

01:32:01.113 --> 01:32:04.013
It is an honor to be
defeated by a Kayi Alp.

01:32:09.113 --> 01:32:10.246
Am I wrong, Ertugrul Bey?

01:32:43.946 --> 01:32:45.879
I told you not to
come here, right Noyan?

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:52.913
What else I can do if scent
of woman outweighed your words.

01:32:53.846 --> 01:32:58.479
Goncagul Hatun is
stricken with grief.

01:33:00.879 --> 01:33:02.846
I saw the Alp of Armed man Tugtekin.

01:33:03.713 --> 01:33:05.179
Is it Goncagul Hatun's cunningness?

01:33:06.513 --> 01:33:08.046
So you’ve smelled blood, right?

01:33:08.846 --> 01:33:10.246
What did Armed man's Alp say?

01:33:11.146 --> 01:33:14.479
Ertugrul's brother Dundar
and Halime Hatun's brother...

01:33:14.813 --> 01:33:16.146
-Shazada Yigit?
-Yes.

01:33:16.746 --> 01:33:19.279
They will come back to the nomad
group from Erzurum tomorrow.

01:33:20.246 --> 01:33:24.046
I am sure you want to
welcome them kindly.

01:33:24.813 --> 01:33:26.879
You can be sure that
I will show kindness.

01:33:27.413 --> 01:33:31.446
But Shazada Yigit's blood is royal.

01:33:33.513 --> 01:33:36.979
I do not want him to die. -I
think you want to kill him at last.

01:33:54.846 --> 01:34:00.813
I want to talk about the main issue
which brought us together tonight.

01:34:05.813 --> 01:34:08.446
If you let me, Tugtekin
Bey. -Yes, Mother Hayme.

01:34:11.113 --> 01:34:13.979
Dogan grew up in my own arms

01:34:15.813 --> 01:34:18.179
just like Bamsi and
Turgut and my own sons.

01:34:21.279 --> 01:34:27.513
Just as Banu Cicek who grew up
with Korkut Bey and Duru Hatun.

01:34:28.846 --> 01:34:29.846
Thank you.

01:34:32.446 --> 01:34:35.146
These young people’ve lost
their heart to each other.

01:34:40.113 --> 01:34:46.013
They want to get permission and set
up a home and raise good children.

01:34:49.113 --> 01:34:54.779
With the permission of God
and the words of Prophet

01:34:55.113 --> 01:35:00.046
we want Banu Cicek to Dogan Alp

01:35:03.179 --> 01:35:04.413
who is the Alp of Ertugrul.

01:35:08.446 --> 01:35:12.046
Banu Cicek and Dogan Alp are
honor of two nomad groups.

01:35:13.513 --> 01:35:17.346
They both risked their lives

01:35:18.146 --> 01:35:21.346
to protect the honor
of the two nomad groups.

01:35:23.279 --> 01:35:25.046
They are both so precious for us.

01:35:30.813 --> 01:35:32.246
If Ertugrul Bey also allows

01:35:33.713 --> 01:35:37.513
we would be happy
for their happiness.

01:35:41.479 --> 01:35:43.179
May God make them one and happy.

01:35:45.279 --> 01:35:49.879
If you and my mother favor,
their happiness makes us happy.

01:35:53.279 --> 01:35:55.046
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey. Thank you.

01:35:56.279 --> 01:35:58.079
Cicek Hatun. -Yes, Bey.

01:35:59.279 --> 01:36:01.179
You devoted your life to my
father and to our nomad group.

01:36:02.879 --> 01:36:07.113
From now on you will devote your life
to your husband and to Kayi nomad group.

01:36:08.313 --> 01:36:11.213
So you know all these and still
want this brave Alp, right?

01:36:12.379 --> 01:36:13.513
I know, Tugtekin Bey.

01:36:15.246 --> 01:36:17.713
I would die for Dodurga
nomad group and you.

01:36:19.213 --> 01:36:21.413
But my destiny

01:36:23.446 --> 01:36:26.179
and the path my heart follows
are drawn with Dogan Alp.

01:36:30.813 --> 01:36:31.813
Alright.

01:36:33.213 --> 01:36:36.413
Do have a word, Dogan Alp?

01:36:38.379 --> 01:36:40.246
May God protect you, Tugtekin Bey.

01:36:42.013 --> 01:36:46.313
Thanks God, you allowed us
in this happy nawruz day.

01:36:47.779 --> 01:36:48.813
Thank you.

01:37:00.713 --> 01:37:03.013
Then, may God make you happy.

01:37:27.746 --> 01:37:30.813
Well Bamsi, Dogan is
also getting married.

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:33.746
It is your turn.

01:37:34.979 --> 01:37:36.879
My woman is my sword.

01:37:43.479 --> 01:37:46.513
Brothers, Tugtekin Bey
gave Banu Cicek to me!

01:37:47.313 --> 01:37:48.879
God!

01:37:51.213 --> 01:37:52.813
Congratulations, brother!

01:37:54.046 --> 01:37:57.913
Brother! Congratulations, brother!

01:38:00.146 --> 01:38:05.479
So that you are getting married, I
want to give your wedding gift early.

01:38:19.946 --> 01:38:20.946
Here.

01:38:29.279 --> 01:38:30.279
What is this?

01:38:30.846 --> 01:38:31.946
Your new sword.

01:38:33.179 --> 01:38:36.513
Banu Cicek will not
allow you to inculcate

01:38:37.346 --> 01:38:40.779
so brother Turgut made it to
inculcate with brother Turali.

01:38:47.746 --> 01:38:48.746
Congratulations, brother.

01:38:57.079 --> 01:38:59.479
There are important matters that
we need to talk in headquarters.

01:39:00.179 --> 01:39:02.813
We need to talk them
as soon as possible.

01:39:04.313 --> 01:39:05.446
Is it about migration, Mother Hayme?

01:39:06.879 --> 01:39:10.946
Yes, it is time to
talk about it, but...

01:39:14.979 --> 01:39:16.813
...there are other important matters.

01:39:21.179 --> 01:39:24.213
I will inform Beys and we can gather our
headquarters tomorrow, if God permits.

01:39:25.013 --> 01:39:26.813
I want to talk about this
matter with you, as well.

01:39:27.913 --> 01:39:29.046
But you should know that
this migration will not be

01:39:29.379 --> 01:39:33.813
like removing our tents
and gathering our flocks.

01:39:35.346 --> 01:39:36.413
Sadettin Kobek.

01:39:39.079 --> 01:39:40.146
Ertugrul Bey is right.

01:39:41.413 --> 01:39:44.113
He said he will call us to account
for the killer he protected.

01:39:46.446 --> 01:39:49.113
We will see what kind of a
trouble he causes us, soon.

01:39:50.213 --> 01:39:53.446
He cannot do anything as long as
these two nomad groups are together.

01:39:54.079 --> 01:39:55.213
You are right, brother.

01:39:57.746 --> 01:40:01.146
But he can do everything

01:40:02.279 --> 01:40:03.746
because he has the seal of the state.

01:40:13.946 --> 01:40:15.013
Forgive me, father.

01:40:17.813 --> 01:40:18.813
Forgive me.

01:40:20.413 --> 01:40:21.746
I have to do this.

01:40:44.346 --> 01:40:45.346
Noyan.

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:53.713
You remind me the lands
that I was born in, woman.

01:41:54.780 --> 01:42:00.313
Gobi desert's rain is
as salty as your tears.

01:42:01.313 --> 01:42:03.013
It is as desolate as your eyes.

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:19.046
It's winds are as warm
as your breath in gloom during the day.

01:42:28.013 --> 01:42:29.480
It's night is as cold as your heart.

01:42:31.813 --> 01:42:35.780
While the sun blights the desert...

01:42:36.846 --> 01:42:41.846
...I was finding solace
in the ice that hid behind the rocks.

01:42:44.713 --> 01:42:46.413
What do you want from me, Noyan?

01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:59.813
I want to get lost in the solitude
of your eyes...

01:43:01.713 --> 01:43:04.013
...and I want melt in the warmth
of your breath.

01:43:14.846 --> 01:43:18.946
I will come and take you after
I am done with Shahzada tomorrow.

01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:21.046
Wait for me.

01:44:24.346 --> 01:44:25.913
I have missed Yigit so much.

01:44:26.946 --> 01:44:29.346
This is the first time
we remained separated that long.

01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:33.046
The longing inside me
is growing with time.

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:39.013
If God permits, they will come safe
and sound soon.

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:41.313
If God permits, Bey.

01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:49.480
But I will keep worrying until Yigit and
Dundar come back to nomad group.

01:44:53.313 --> 01:44:58.146
Because he is a Shahzada, my brother
did not have a moment of peace.

01:45:01.013 --> 01:45:03.380
We suffered a lot,
we survived many hardships.

01:45:07.113 --> 01:45:09.680
I am afraid that something
will happen to him.

01:45:15.246 --> 01:45:16.246
Thank you.

01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.146
Please, Beys, please.

01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:42.846
Hayme Hatun wanted to talk to Beys
about the matters of the nomad group.

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.813
If she permits, I want Mother Hayme
to manage the headquarters...

01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:52.046
...because she is our elder.

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.813
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey.

01:47:05.213 --> 01:47:07.180
With the 99 names of Almighty God...

01:47:08.813 --> 01:47:11.213
...the One who created us...

01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:15.913
...and filled our hearts with faith.

01:47:17.313 --> 01:47:18.346
In the name of God.

01:47:22.046 --> 01:47:24.280
Beys! Brave men!

01:47:25.846 --> 01:47:30.946
Nobles of my nomad group, welcome.

01:47:34.246 --> 01:47:38.680
There are problems that we have to solve.

01:47:42.246 --> 01:47:43.280
But first...

01:47:44.313 --> 01:47:49.146
...I want to give the word to Gundogdu Bey
who is the Head of Alps.

01:47:53.013 --> 01:47:55.213
He would like to tell us something.

01:47:59.713 --> 01:48:00.880
Please, Gundogdu Bey.

01:48:02.813 --> 01:48:07.913
If God permits, I will go to Erzurum
with Mother Hayme to see a doctor...

01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:12.946
...which Artuk Bey advised us
after headquarters.

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.813
The situation of my arm is unknown.

01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:20.446
While I am in this state...

01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:26.846
...for the safety of Alps and the people...

01:48:28.313 --> 01:48:32.446
...I am withdrawing from Head of Alps duty.

01:48:41.213 --> 01:48:43.346
Your decision made us sad, Gundogdu Bey.

01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:47.846
Thank you, Bey. This is our destiny.

01:48:50.913 --> 01:48:53.046
If you permit...

01:48:54.113 --> 01:48:59.213
...for the security of headquarters
I want to choose a Head of Alp.

01:49:01.146 --> 01:49:06.246
It is obvious that Ameer Sadettin and
Noyan will not leave us in peace.

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.746
I want to see...

01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:19.380
...Ertugrul Bey as the Head of Alp.

01:49:23.013 --> 01:49:24.280
Of course, if he accepts.

01:49:30.213 --> 01:49:31.380
Right, right.

01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:34.913
Ertugrul Bey is the best choice.

01:49:35.213 --> 01:49:37.746
We want him to be our Head of Alps.

01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:42.046
-Yes, Ertugrul should be the Head of Alps.
-Yes.

01:49:42.313 --> 01:49:43.313
That's true.

01:49:44.346 --> 01:49:45.346
Thank you.

01:49:48.413 --> 01:49:49.413
Thank you.

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:52.746
I am honored...

01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:58.880
...because you deemed me worthy
of this important duty.

01:50:00.813 --> 01:50:01.813
But...

01:50:03.146 --> 01:50:07.480
...I have other things to arrange
before this duty.

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:20.446
If Ertugrul Bey has more important
matters than being Head of Alps...

01:50:21.213 --> 01:50:23.713
...surely he will tell us
when the time comes.

01:50:27.713 --> 01:50:30.180
Then, I want to declare my own candidate.

01:50:33.246 --> 01:50:34.280
Sungurtekin Bey.

01:50:42.413 --> 01:50:45.080
What do you think about this,
Sungurtekin Bey?

01:50:51.846 --> 01:50:53.113
If you Beys permit...

01:50:54.113 --> 01:50:56.880
...I want to officiate this holy duty
with honor.

01:51:03.946 --> 01:51:05.913
Does anyone has a say about this?

01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:08.980
We want Sungurtekin Bey as
the Head of Alps, Hayme Hatun.

01:51:10.813 --> 01:51:15.013
He will bring strength to the nomad group,
Hayme Hatun.

01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:20.746
Yes, we want to see Sungurtekin Bey
as the Head of Alps.

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:24.080
Tugtekin Bey?

01:51:26.713 --> 01:51:29.846
We would be honored
to have him at this post.

01:51:31.013 --> 01:51:32.013
Thank you.

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:34.946
Sungurtekin Bey.

01:51:36.246 --> 01:51:39.280
-May your holy duty be beneficent.
-Thank you.

01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:41.013
Good luck with it, brother.

01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:51.780
No matter where trouble comes from...

01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:55.913
...I will be leading our Alps
until I my last breath.

01:51:56.346 --> 01:51:58.080
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

01:51:58.446 --> 01:52:01.013
-Congratulations, Bey.
-Congratulations.

01:52:02.313 --> 01:52:03.346
Congratulations.

01:52:04.746 --> 01:52:05.813
Congratulations.

01:52:21.713 --> 01:52:22.880
It is the time, Ulubilge.

01:52:24.446 --> 01:52:28.346
Ertugrul, his wife and his unborn child...

01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.746
...will slowly fall into my trap.

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:35.346
Everyone who lives in Suleyman Shah's
marquee...

01:52:35.913 --> 01:52:38.113
...will get their share from my sword.

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:39.946
And Kobek?

01:52:40.246 --> 01:52:42.313
Let him think that he is
holding my halter.

01:52:44.213 --> 01:52:47.780
He will understand that he cannot even be
the hoof of the horse that I ride...

01:52:47.846 --> 01:52:49.680
...for revenge, when I cut his head.

01:52:50.213 --> 01:52:56.180
No one can ever betray Noyan and survive.

01:52:58.013 --> 01:52:59.280
When the time comes...

01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:02.813
...Kobek will go beside Tangut.

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:07.346
He will suffer torment forever
with the underground souls.

01:53:08.013 --> 01:53:10.713
He will get his share from
Erlik Khan's torment.

01:53:13.346 --> 01:53:15.680
Prepare a big feast tonight.

01:53:17.013 --> 01:53:21.213
There will be a precious guest
along with my captives.

01:53:23.146 --> 01:53:24.213
As you please, Noyan.

01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:35.946
May the lands that we fight, wander and
spill blood, be our home!

01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:37.313
Our home!

01:53:38.413 --> 01:53:43.746
My brave men who follow Genghis Khan,
it is time for revenge!

01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:46.746
-For revenge!
-Revenge!

01:53:47.113 --> 01:53:49.946
For blood!
We are ready to die for Noyan!

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:51.880
May you have your revenge!

01:53:52.313 --> 01:53:56.480
For revenge! For blood!
We are ready to die for Noyan!

01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:58.313
May you have your revenge!

01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:02.880
For revenge! For blood!
We are ready to die for Noyan!

01:54:06.213 --> 01:54:08.313
After all these sufferings, I understood...

01:54:09.313 --> 01:54:11.113
...that unity made us powerful.

01:54:12.046 --> 01:54:15.346
I hope the union of the two nomad groups,
this sharing of fate...

01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:19.846
...will continue against the Mongols
and the betrayers inside us.

01:54:20.446 --> 01:54:21.880
Tugtekin Bey is right.

01:54:22.046 --> 01:54:24.313
Kayis and Dodurgas are partners in fate.

01:54:24.913 --> 01:54:26.880
Everyone friend or foe knows this.

01:54:27.113 --> 01:54:29.746
We are stronger now, you are right, Bey.

01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:35.846
So it is time to talk about migration.

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.213
I think the most appropriate
place is Ahlat.

01:54:42.013 --> 01:54:47.180
It's fertile mountains are suitable
to feed our flocks.

01:54:48.746 --> 01:54:53.913
And our commerce with Ahlat will get
strong as our Sultan reclaimed.

01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:56.380
-Right.
-Right.

01:54:58.046 --> 01:55:01.813
Ahlat is on the road of trade routes.
My heart's desire is this too.

01:55:05.946 --> 01:55:08.013
We can depart soon if fate
so decrees, Bey.

01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:10.779
It's road is smooth and safe.

01:55:11.246 --> 01:55:13.746
We can arrive and settle
within the shortest time.

01:55:14.146 --> 01:55:16.746
Elders and children can go slowly.

01:55:17.279 --> 01:55:19.213
No one will fall in the ditch
on the road.

01:55:22.213 --> 01:55:23.880
Does anybody wants to say anything?

01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:30.780
If you permit,
I want to talk, Mother Hayme.

01:55:34.046 --> 01:55:36.113
Yes, Ertugrul Bey, have your say.

01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:39.113
Brave men of Oghuz!

01:55:41.046 --> 01:55:44.680
The destiny that calls for the union of
the two nomad groups is praiseworthy.

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:49.780
I became aware of something while fighting
neck and neck with all troubles...

01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:52.046
...and ominous enemies...

01:55:52.913 --> 01:55:56.946
...it is time to migrate not to where
our herds will feed...

01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:00.113
...but on the holy road of our destiny.

01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:06.213
How is this a holy road, Bey?

01:56:07.046 --> 01:56:08.713
Do not we migrate for our herds?

01:56:08.946 --> 01:56:12.180
Tell us, Ertugrul Bey.
What is on your mind?

01:56:15.446 --> 01:56:18.346
This blessed road is
a holy war road for us.

01:56:24.946 --> 01:56:28.313
This blessed road is our road to
holy war for our nomad groups...

01:56:28.713 --> 01:56:30.346
...which are stuck between two worlds.

01:56:31.346 --> 01:56:33.280
If we continue to follow our herds...

01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:38.413
...there will be no Oghuz's customs,
being an Alp or peace left.

01:56:41.846 --> 01:56:47.380
As the wind blows, as the rain falls
they will take us from ourselves.

01:56:49.846 --> 01:56:53.080
Your words inflames the lion inside
each brave man, Ertugrul Bey.

01:56:55.346 --> 01:57:00.946
But if you want us to fight with the
Mongols who holds one part of the world...

01:57:03.013 --> 01:57:06.246
...would we not put our nomad group
on a path that is unknown?

01:57:07.413 --> 01:57:11.113
Wars or jihad are not with the Mongols...

01:57:13.046 --> 01:57:14.780
...but in the lands where the sun sets.

01:57:23.813 --> 01:57:26.980
In the Byzantine border of our state.

01:57:44.113 --> 01:57:45.213
Are we going to war?

01:57:50.013 --> 01:57:52.346
<i>Permission! Ameer Sadettin Kobek!</i>

01:57:53.346 --> 01:57:54.346
Come in.

01:58:08.113 --> 01:58:10.380
-Last night Noyan came.
-I know, yes.

01:58:11.746 --> 01:58:13.213
He visited me last night.

01:58:16.246 --> 01:58:19.713
He said he will take me
when he is done with the Shahzada.

01:58:21.213 --> 01:58:22.213
So...

01:58:23.913 --> 01:58:24.980
...will you go?

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:30.413
As a follower of our cause...

01:58:31.446 --> 01:58:34.180
I would like to see
the fate of our Shahzada and Dundar.

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:36.680
Good.

01:58:42.246 --> 01:58:43.246
But be careful.

01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:49.013
Noyan should not learn that
you are under my command.

01:58:50.346 --> 01:58:52.713
Otherwise, without a care of your tears...

01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:57.780
...he would gouge your beautiful eyes out.

01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:01.146
Do not worry, your highness Ameer.

01:59:03.113 --> 01:59:04.280
I will do what is necessary.

01:59:07.313 --> 01:59:09.180
Good. Good.

01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:19.180
What are you saying, Ertugrul Bey?

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:24.780
Do you want to put us in a dangerous
position after all these trouble?

01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:29.746
If someone asks me...

01:59:31.146 --> 01:59:36.313
...to assign someone for
the pride of my nomad group...

01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:39.780
...I would assign you without
hesitation, Ertugrul Bey.

01:59:45.313 --> 01:59:46.480
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey.

01:59:47.713 --> 01:59:51.213
But I am not only responsible of myself.

01:59:52.346 --> 01:59:53.680
As Gundogdu Bey says...

01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:57.913
...I disapprove the unknown path
for our two nomad groups.

02:00:00.246 --> 02:00:04.780
Ertugrul Bey offered us
a different migration route.

02:00:06.146 --> 02:00:10.213
I would like to discuss this
with the Beys of the two nomad groups.

02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:15.180
I do not understand what
you want to discuss, Mother Hayme.

02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:17.380
I don't want to understand either.

02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:21.313
People want to migrate to Ahlat,
it is obvious.

02:00:21.846 --> 02:00:24.680
-True.
-He is right.

02:00:25.213 --> 02:00:26.346
Gundogdu Bey is right.

02:00:27.813 --> 02:00:31.713
Gundogdu Bey,
headquarters is a consultation place.

02:00:32.846 --> 02:00:35.113
Each Bey has a right to talk.

02:00:35.746 --> 02:00:36.880
Of course.

02:00:37.146 --> 02:00:43.313
But will we be migrating to the Byzantine
border because of Ertugrul Bey's request?

02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:46.446
Ask to Beys...

02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:51.380
...who will want something like that
after all those wars and exhaustion?

02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:58.280
Gundogdu Bey, Noyan's unrest and
Sadettin Kobek's troubles are not over.

02:01:00.213 --> 02:01:03.413
We cannot sacrifice our nomad groups'
destiny for sweet dreams.

02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:07.313
Ertugrul Bey, your will is obvious
but ask to the Beys.

02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:12.346
Who wants to fight with
the Byzantine again?

02:01:14.746 --> 02:01:17.146
I think we should discuss this matter.

02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:24.180
I think the same, as the Head of Alps,
Gundogdu Bey.

02:01:29.813 --> 02:01:33.046
The ones who wants to discuss
Ertugrul Bey's idea...

02:01:33.246 --> 02:01:35.046
...please put your hands up.

02:01:46.313 --> 02:01:48.013
No. No. I do not accept.

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:09.380
Do you have anything to say, Ertugrul Bey?

02:02:10.713 --> 02:02:11.746
Yes, Mother Hayme.

02:02:12.913 --> 02:02:14.413
Here, the word is yours.

02:02:17.213 --> 02:02:21.013
You should know that the lands
that will shape not only our fate...

02:02:21.746 --> 02:02:24.780
...but also all Oghuz tribes' destiny...

02:02:25.913 --> 02:02:29.413
...may be where the sun sets
but it will be where we shall rise.

02:02:30.813 --> 02:02:35.446
The lands that will protect us from
powerless governors and ill ambitions...

02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:41.246
...where our great people can take root
are near the Byzantine border.

02:02:42.746 --> 02:02:48.180
We can only be united and in solidarity
with war, jihad and conquest.

02:02:53.713 --> 02:02:55.013
These are my last words.

02:02:56.846 --> 02:02:59.246
It is time to migrate for me.

02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:06.446
The ones who believe in me
and has faith in his heart...

02:03:07.813 --> 02:03:09.346
...will come with me without any doubt.

02:03:16.146 --> 02:03:17.780
May God speed all of us.

02:03:27.213 --> 02:03:28.280
With your permission.

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:27.680
I have never seen Ertugrul Bey like this.

02:04:28.713 --> 02:04:30.280
Will we wait like this, brother?

02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:32.013
Of course not.

02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:34.780
Let's follow him, if he does not want,
we can turn back.

02:04:34.846 --> 02:04:35.913
Come on, to the horses!

02:05:58.146 --> 02:06:01.413
My mother and brothers,
I missed all of them a lot.

02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:04.013
I am longing for my sister.

02:06:04.346 --> 02:06:06.746
Mostly, I wonder about
my brother Sungurtekin.

02:06:06.813 --> 02:06:08.113
Did you not see him before?

02:06:08.913 --> 02:06:12.346
He left the nomad group when I was a baby.
I would not recognize if I saw him.

02:06:12.413 --> 02:06:14.313
Our road is almost finished, Dundar Bey.

02:06:14.380 --> 02:06:17.013
If God permits, you will meet
with your brother soon.

02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:18.780
If God permits, brother. If God permits.

02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:41.280
Tell Noyan that we found those two boys.

02:06:52.213 --> 02:06:55.780
Sungur, look after Ertugrul.

02:06:59.346 --> 02:07:01.413
The condition of
our nomad group is obvious.

02:07:02.046 --> 02:07:04.280
We cannot go on a new adventure.

02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:17.380
Halime, Selcan.

02:07:18.913 --> 02:07:21.413
Take care of Dundar and Yigit
when we are not here.

02:07:22.413 --> 02:07:25.713
-We will come back as soon as possible.
-If God permits, mother.

02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:28.946
May God speed you. Do not think about us.

02:07:29.346 --> 02:07:30.680
Do not worry, mother.

02:07:31.413 --> 02:07:33.280
May Gundogdu Bey found his cure.

02:07:38.913 --> 02:07:39.946
Daughter Gokce.

02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:45.813
You are sad for a long time.
Is there something you do not tell?

02:07:47.313 --> 02:07:49.446
No, Mother Hayme. Nothing.

02:07:53.113 --> 02:07:54.213
May God speed you.

02:07:56.446 --> 02:07:57.746
May God save you all.

02:08:01.146 --> 02:08:02.246
May God speed you, Bey.

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:10.246
-Goodbye, daughter.
-May God speed you, Mother Hayme.

02:08:11.446 --> 02:08:12.446
Mother.

02:08:15.146 --> 02:08:17.313
-May God speed you.
-Goodbye, Gundogdu Bey.

02:08:18.213 --> 02:08:19.280
Thank you, son.

02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:23.213
May you find your cure
as soon as possible, Bey.

02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:34.313
In the name of God!

02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:33.246
Welcome, Selcan Hatun.

02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:38.080
Thank you, Bey.

02:09:41.013 --> 02:09:42.080
Did Gundogdu Bey go?

02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:45.246
-Yes.
-May God unite you again.

02:09:45.946 --> 02:09:46.946
Thank you.

02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:50.180
-I hope that he finds a cure there.
-If God permits, Bey.

02:09:59.313 --> 02:10:00.813
Yes, I am listening to you.

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:04.880
Gokce, Bey.

02:10:05.746 --> 02:10:07.846
She has been sad for a long time.

02:10:08.780 --> 02:10:13.313
She stopped eating, has gone all pale.

02:10:14.813 --> 02:10:19.046
She is your woman. I cannot say anything
if you don't permit.

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:24.180
But I cannot stand to see
my sister like this.

02:10:27.313 --> 02:10:28.380
Selcan Hatun.

02:10:30.413 --> 02:10:35.346
You are precious to me because
of your mercy, courage, honesty.

02:10:36.246 --> 02:10:37.913
I hold you dear in my marquee...

02:10:38.413 --> 02:10:42.013
...but this is between me and Gokce Hatun.

02:10:47.846 --> 02:10:49.946
What is the matter between you, Bey?

02:10:51.046 --> 02:10:55.046
When I look at Gokce Hatun
I see a woman who would die for you...

02:10:55.746 --> 02:11:00.846
...who can live for your life
if it is required, what is the matter?

02:11:03.813 --> 02:11:07.280
Do not give me a hard time, Selcan Hatun.
I do not want to offend you.

02:11:08.913 --> 02:11:12.813
You offended my sister,
you broke her to pieces.

02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:14.246
Selcan Hatun!

02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:18.813
Do you think that I will never resent
if you break me to pieces...

02:11:19.146 --> 02:11:20.913
...if you break my heart, Bey?

02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:23.780
I know, if you did not love her...

02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:27.346
...you would not let her stay
in your state tent, in your bed.

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:32.913
Do not do this. I cannot stand a man and
a woman in love to be in this situation.

02:11:33.246 --> 02:11:34.313
Please, Bey!

02:11:43.146 --> 02:11:44.180
She lied to me.

02:11:46.113 --> 02:11:49.446
She lied to me while her heart
was still in love with Ertugrul!

02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:51.180
Did you want to hear this?

02:11:53.913 --> 02:11:55.113
Is this the matter, Bey?

02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:00.446
You are obsessing about the innocent
whim of an innocent child.

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:04.413
Innocent? Do you call this innocent?

02:12:05.246 --> 02:12:07.213
Gokce told this to me, Selcan Hatun.

02:12:07.346 --> 02:12:11.046
She said that she rubbed salt in her wound
when Ertugrul Bey took Halime Sultan...

02:12:11.113 --> 02:12:14.280
...to the nomad group but
she still could not forget him.

02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:20.013
She said that she branded her wound with
hot iron when he got married with Halime...

02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:25.280
...but she still could not forget him,
she said that it did not work.

02:12:26.213 --> 02:12:28.313
Did she not say the things
that happened later?

02:12:28.379 --> 02:12:33.746
That she understood God's reason
when He brought you to her?

02:12:34.113 --> 02:12:36.213
That her love for Ertugrul was not real.

02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:40.146
Did she not say that she found real love
in your eyes and in your sweet words?

02:12:41.746 --> 02:12:43.046
Did you not see her excitement...

02:12:44.379 --> 02:12:47.746
...happiness and peace
the night you got married?

02:12:52.413 --> 02:12:54.046
What about getting stabbed?

02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:59.813
That she  cannot give a child to me!
And she hid this from me!

02:13:01.980 --> 02:13:04.080
How can I share my marquee with a woman...

02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:08.746
...who hides the truth from me?

02:13:11.713 --> 02:13:14.946
It is not your duty to interfere with
the volition of God, Tugtekin Bey.

02:13:17.013 --> 02:13:19.080
I lost my children before they were born.

02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:24.980
Gundogdu Bey buried them in the ground
before I breastfed them.

02:13:29.013 --> 02:13:31.246
God then blessed me with one more child.

02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:38.380
My only wish is to hold him in
my arms and see him grow.

02:13:40.946 --> 02:13:42.746
What is past is past.

02:13:44.013 --> 02:13:48.680
The volition of God is the love
of Gokce for you.

02:13:50.146 --> 02:13:51.480
Do not do this, Bey.

02:13:53.113 --> 02:13:57.846
Do not torture the one who loves you
and the one who you love.

02:14:22.046 --> 02:14:25.213
The matter in my marquee should stay
in my nomad tent, Selcan Hatun.

02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:28.813
Just go your own way.

02:14:29.913 --> 02:14:33.746
Let everyone suffer from their own pain.

02:14:57.046 --> 02:14:58.946
-Are we ready?
-We are almost ready, Bey.

02:14:59.113 --> 02:15:01.246
-Alps are getting ready.
-When shall we depart?

02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:03.680
-Whenever you are ready.
-Well, alright.

02:15:15.213 --> 02:15:17.980
If you are ready, let's go.
We are already quiet near.

02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:19.846
We should not have stopped.

02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:30.980
Dundar Bey, Yigit Bey, run!
Protect their path!

02:15:51.313 --> 02:15:53.280
Inform the nomad group brother, hurry up!

02:16:08.213 --> 02:16:11.380
Cutting your head will be pleasure for me!

02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:20.080
Attack!

02:17:39.146 --> 02:17:41.846
Why are we running away?
Why do we not fight?

02:17:42.013 --> 02:17:44.013
It is not possible, Bey!
They are too many!

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:47.413
We cannot deal with them! It is our duty
to take you safe and sound!

02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:49.880
You go on!

02:17:50.913 --> 02:17:52.413
Come on! Come on, Yigit!

02:19:32.146 --> 02:19:34.980
You cannot resist to Noyan!
You should surrender!

02:19:37.746 --> 02:19:39.213
We shall not surrender, Yigit!

02:19:39.813 --> 02:19:41.246
If we surrender, we will die!

02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:43.746
I don't even think about
surrendering, Dundar Bey.

02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:50.780
Surrender!

02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:52.680
You cannot resist to Noyan!

02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:49.380
My brave!

02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:51.080
My Alp!

02:21:00.346 --> 02:21:01.346
My brave!

02:21:01.713 --> 02:21:04.146
Help them, Ertugrul Bey!

02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:06.880
Dundar Bey and Yigit Alp...

02:21:08.813 --> 02:21:09.913
...are in danger.

02:21:12.013 --> 02:21:13.246
They are in the slope below.

02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:16.146
Who did this?

02:21:17.146 --> 02:21:18.213
No...

02:21:19.046 --> 02:21:20.046
Noyan!

02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:41.713
Put them down.

02:21:43.346 --> 02:21:45.046
I do not have a problem with you.

02:21:46.313 --> 02:21:48.980
How can I have a problem
with two children?

02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:54.146
My problem is with Ertugrul.

02:21:57.080 --> 02:21:58.146
I said, put them down!

02:22:25.213 --> 02:22:26.213
Take them.

02:22:31.413 --> 02:22:32.446
Noyan!

02:22:39.046 --> 02:22:40.046
Look at you!
