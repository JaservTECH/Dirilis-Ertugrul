Episode 42 will start after 12:35 min.

12:35.268 --> 12:39.468
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:40.656 --> 12:44.256
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:44.611 --> 12:47.811
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.613
You have no more patience left for me...

14:10.180 --> 14:16.980
...my existence, breathe and warmth
in your bad,...

14:17.213 --> 14:21.147
...do you, Gundogdu Bey?

14:22.480 --> 14:24.747
I said that I will give you a son.

14:27.980 --> 14:30.180
I am pregnant with your baby.

14:30.647 --> 14:32.613
I will give a brave son for the
nomad group...

14:33.380 --> 14:35.947
...and son of a Bey for Kayi.

14:36.513 --> 14:38.447
You will name him.

14:38.613 --> 14:40.747
God will decide his life.

14:41.513 --> 14:44.180
He will be the hope for the nomad group.

14:44.247 --> 14:45.947
His father's pride.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.247
Selcan.

14:53.147 --> 14:55.080
Oh Selcan oh!

14:59.113 --> 15:02.313
Permission, Gundogdu Bey?

15:02.680 --> 15:04.080
Come in, Dumrul.

15:08.513 --> 15:10.547
Trader Efrasiyab is here, Bey.

15:11.013 --> 15:12.480
Let him in.

15:16.713 --> 15:20.047
-Peace be upon you, Gundogdu Bey.
-And peace be upon you.

15:20.247 --> 15:21.947
Welcome.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.580
Thank you, Bey.

15:24.213 --> 15:27.480
We prepared the golds and they will be
in the nomad group for a few days.

15:27.647 --> 15:30.947
Very well. Then you get some rest.

15:31.413 --> 15:34.413
Dumrul, take Efrasiyab to the guest tent.

15:34.613 --> 15:37.747
-Welcome him in a suitable way for Kayis.
-Yes, my Bey.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.380
Thank you, Bey.

16:52.380 --> 16:54.380
Do not worry.

16:55.547 --> 16:57.647
I have sealed my mouth and heart for...

16:58.213 --> 17:04.013
...the happiness of Bey until death.

17:05.980 --> 17:08.647
I will not step in the tent you live...

17:09.580 --> 17:14.313
...with Bey, so Bey can be happy
and you can give him children...

17:14.680 --> 17:19.147
...that I could not...

17:21.247 --> 17:24.147
I will not be a shadow to your home.

17:28.013 --> 17:34.647
But now listen to me very well, Goncagul.

17:37.580 --> 17:41.313
If I understand that you and your...

17:41.547 --> 17:45.580
...aunt come together and harm
a hair of Gundogdu...

17:48.380 --> 17:51.047
...then I will kill both of you.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.380
You know that.

17:59.213 --> 18:01.580
And you know that, Selcan Hatun.

18:02.213 --> 18:04.047
Do not worry.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.347
I will give the peace and happiness
that he has forgotten.

18:10.147 --> 18:13.947
I will give him children to make
his family proud.

18:16.247 --> 18:19.213
I will him to remember his manhood
again...

18:20.413 --> 18:22.113
...Selcan Hatun.

18:23.147 --> 18:24.647
How happy you are.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.180
How happy you are.

19:13.447 --> 19:15.347
You are playing with fire, Tangut.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.313
Do not you know what a big trouble
Ertugrul is?

19:18.747 --> 19:20.180
I will kill him.

19:20.513 --> 19:22.480
Nobody can liberate him from me.

19:25.613 --> 19:27.613
How do you know that he will come here?

19:31.213 --> 19:33.347
If Noyan learns that you are
messing things up...

19:35.147 --> 19:36.980
You shut up, Karabek.

19:38.247 --> 19:40.113
They will be here sooner or later.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.547
And you will fight like a man.

19:43.680 --> 19:48.347
Or I will kill you like a whore in here.

19:54.213 --> 19:56.213
What an ominous man!

20:11.247 --> 20:12.413
Do not forget!

20:12.680 --> 20:14.547
We will make equal shares.

20:21.747 --> 20:27.647
But one of us draws a blank.
And that will be Dogan brother.

20:27.747 --> 20:29.013
Stop it.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.413
We should make this work done.

20:37.413 --> 20:38.547
Come along.

20:46.047 --> 20:47.480
Tangut!

20:59.380 --> 21:00.647
Welcome, Ertugrul.

21:02.147 --> 21:03.513
We were waiting for you.

21:09.047 --> 21:11.080
Come and eat something.

21:11.513 --> 21:13.613
Enjoy your life before you die.

21:13.980 --> 21:17.213
You ignoble! How did you know that
we will come?

21:40.713 --> 21:42.980
God help me!

26:14.613 --> 26:16.713
Speak now, speak!

26:17.047 --> 26:19.747
Tell me who is Noyan's cur in the palace?
Tell me.

26:20.147 --> 26:22.113
I did something wrong but you forgive me,
Bey.

26:22.180 --> 26:25.580
Talk to me.
Tell me who is Noyan's cur in the palace?

26:26.980 --> 26:28.947
Talk to me Karabek, talk!

26:33.613 --> 26:36.013
-Talk.
-Next will, it be you.

26:48.213 --> 26:50.013
Talk to me, talk.

27:12.013 --> 27:14.313
How did Tangut know that we would
come here?

27:18.213 --> 27:19.947
There is only an answer for this.

27:20.047 --> 27:22.380
They knew of Abdurrahman's intention.

27:23.647 --> 27:26.013
Let us save our brother, Bey.

27:27.380 --> 27:30.980
Noyan that I know will not hurt him
for now.

27:31.247 --> 27:32.613
How will that be, Bey?

27:32.680 --> 27:35.113
Abdurrahman does not know what happened.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.980
Noyan will use Abdurrahman to kill me.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.013
You will be the most beautiful bride
I have ever seen.

28:46.747 --> 28:50.647
We sacrificed ourselves for the future of
Oghuz, aunt.

28:54.547 --> 28:56.380
But mostly, you did this.

28:59.013 --> 29:02.013
You had too much trouble with the old man.

29:03.947 --> 29:06.447
If God permits, one day you will be
very happy, aunt.

29:06.947 --> 29:08.380
If God permits.

29:12.213 --> 29:16.180
I am proud to have an aunt like you.
You should know it.

29:53.380 --> 29:56.480
I did not want to leave Bey alone
on such a day.

30:18.413 --> 30:22.113
The needlework of your clothes that
I knit one by one.

30:25.513 --> 30:30.713
Ornaments of your leather belt which is
light of my eyes.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.447
You have everything that I bought
for my man,...

30:36.347 --> 30:39.280
...valiant from Aleppo...

30:39.613 --> 30:44.247
...to Bukhara from Diyarbakir is on you.

30:46.980 --> 30:49.613
All is for your happiness.

30:54.380 --> 30:59.113
Thanks to God that they will also witness
the happiness of this night.

31:15.347 --> 31:21.480
I am happy to hear that your heart is
thrilled.

31:48.147 --> 31:51.047
I will send you as a groom from my bed
that is poisonous as a snake...

32:01.480 --> 32:04.247
...sharp as a dagger...

32:13.947 --> 32:15.713
...cold as death...

32:21.413 --> 32:26.580
...to your new love, Goncagul's bed.

32:37.347 --> 32:39.647
Do not worry, Bey.

32:40.347 --> 32:42.613
I hope you will be happy forever.

32:43.547 --> 32:46.480
I hope you will find everything...

32:47.447 --> 32:52.180
...that I could not give you love in
my bed...

32:53.613 --> 32:56.747
...baby that she will carry...

32:57.047 --> 32:59.713
...peace in your pure heart with her.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.313
Selcan, I...

33:14.347 --> 33:16.213
Go now.

33:19.347 --> 33:21.647
May God make you happy.

33:22.380 --> 33:27.080
I hope you will have too many children.

34:36.213 --> 34:37.280
Welcome.

34:37.413 --> 34:38.747
Welcome.

34:39.213 --> 34:40.247
Thank you.

34:40.380 --> 34:41.713
Thank you.

34:43.513 --> 34:44.947
Come on in!

34:45.013 --> 34:47.280
Is Tugtekin able to join us?

34:48.447 --> 34:52.347
Tugtekin is resting. You know he is
seriously wounded.

34:54.247 --> 34:55.547
Come on in.

35:43.047 --> 35:45.447
Now we all are here.

36:22.947 --> 36:27.080
Bey, Artuk Bey wants to see you.

36:28.013 --> 36:29.380
Thank you, Dumrul.

36:29.613 --> 36:31.713
I will come and see him soon.

36:38.980 --> 36:41.547
I wish you could come earlier and
have a soup with us.

36:44.047 --> 36:49.313
We came here to have a lifetime soup
with God's permission.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.413
Our reason to be here is...

37:03.013 --> 37:04.147
I am very sorry.

37:04.547 --> 37:05.547
I barely come.

37:05.613 --> 37:07.247
Welcome, nephew.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.380
Thank you, uncle.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.947
Come here.

37:20.380 --> 37:22.113
Welcome, Ertugrul Bey.

37:22.313 --> 37:23.713
Thank you.

37:29.280 --> 37:33.713
Our reason to be here is for a good thing.

37:38.547 --> 37:45.113
We came to ask for Goncagul Hatun
daughter of Gumustekin Bey for...

37:45.580 --> 37:51.147
...Gundogdu son according to the
command of God and word of the Prophet.

38:13.113 --> 38:17.747
That the pure and brave heart of
Gundogdu Bey chose my daughter did...

38:19.280 --> 38:25.147
...not only make us happy but also
my daughter, Goncagul.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.447
I want you to know that first.

38:30.247 --> 38:34.413
But such a blessed intention is not...

38:35.313 --> 38:39.580
...limited that these two young persons
love finds response.

38:43.347 --> 38:45.347
It is much more than that.

38:53.347 --> 39:00.280
Just like our Suleyman Shah, from the
deceased Bey of Dodurga nomad tent--

39:00.447 --> 39:02.713
May our father rest in peace.

39:02.947 --> 39:05.247
-May he rest in peace.
-May God rest his soul.

39:05.313 --> 39:06.980
May he rest in peace.

39:07.213 --> 39:08.213
Amen.

39:08.347 --> 39:09.547
Amen.

39:10.447 --> 39:13.047
If Hayme Hatun asked for this...

39:13.513 --> 39:16.713
...and I remember that beautiful day like
yesterday.

39:18.747 --> 39:23.047
Today is such a blessed day.

39:26.147 --> 39:28.147
We can only wish them good luck...

39:29.147 --> 39:36.147
...and a lifetime in a same bed.

39:41.380 --> 39:47.580
I entrust my only child to Gundogdu Bey
without any hesitation.

39:48.980 --> 39:50.580
I feel comfortable inside.

39:55.447 --> 39:57.947
May God do all the things.

39:58.113 --> 39:59.647
-Amen.
-Amen.

39:59.713 --> 40:03.247
I hope they will have too many children.

40:03.347 --> 40:04.347
-Amen.
-If God permits.

40:04.413 --> 40:06.280
-Amen.
-Amen.

40:29.613 --> 40:32.580
Son, I hope you will be happy.

40:33.513 --> 40:34.980
I hope so too, mother.

40:37.513 --> 40:39.480
May God give you happiness.

40:39.647 --> 40:41.413
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

40:47.013 --> 40:48.313
May God give you happiness.

40:48.380 --> 40:49.947
Thank you, brother.

40:50.013 --> 40:51.947
Good luck with this, brother.

40:53.213 --> 40:55.313
May God give them happiness, sister.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.113
If God permits.

41:35.347 --> 41:37.147
Good luck with that, uncle.

41:38.747 --> 41:40.313
Thank you, nephew.

41:41.447 --> 41:44.280
-Good luck with that, mother.
-Good luck with that, son.

42:33.213 --> 42:35.613
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, Bey.

42:35.980 --> 42:37.980
Welcome. I am sorry to trouble you.

42:38.147 --> 42:40.147
But what I will say is important.

42:40.547 --> 42:43.180
Don't mention it, Artuk Bey. Be my guest.

42:43.480 --> 42:48.247
I brought greetings from your friends
who always love and support you.

42:50.347 --> 42:54.180
They said that Ertugrul Bey is in a
blessed battle.

42:54.513 --> 42:58.447
He fulfilled the duty that he
undertook years ago.

42:59.247 --> 43:03.413
Go and tell him that this brave man
is not alone.

43:04.147 --> 43:05.680
What are you saying, Artuk Bey?

43:07.713 --> 43:10.347
I say greetings from the wise old man,
Bey.

43:16.713 --> 43:18.613
You are one of those who is on duty.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.447
Thanks God.

43:22.013 --> 43:23.380
Where are they waiting?

43:24.413 --> 43:26.980
In Ahlat, the blessed city of Turks.

43:29.113 --> 43:30.280
Thank you.

43:30.947 --> 43:33.380
May God bless you.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.513
Amen.

44:15.213 --> 44:18.047
Ertugrul came our way with his Alps.

44:18.747 --> 44:23.947
I had to kill Karabek while he was
about to tell Sadettin Kobek's name.

44:28.680 --> 44:31.613
How could he know that Karabek will go?

44:34.513 --> 44:36.747
What will happen to Halime Sultan, Noyan?

44:39.480 --> 44:41.580
Send a message to Sadettin Kobek.

44:42.413 --> 44:45.380
Sungurtekin will not front Aleaddin.

44:48.013 --> 44:49.947
How could he follow Karabek?

44:50.480 --> 44:52.313
How did he know his way?

44:56.447 --> 44:58.580
There is a traitor inside of us, Tangut.

45:00.113 --> 45:05.080
He will give me Ertugrul just like
he gave...

45:09.947 --> 45:11.613
...Karabek to Ertugrul.

45:49.447 --> 45:51.480
-Welcome, my Bey.
-Thank you.

45:59.480 --> 46:01.547
This land is a blessed land, Bey.

46:02.447 --> 46:04.380
How could not I know that, Artuk Bey.

46:04.980 --> 46:07.447
I opened my eyes to world in this land.

46:08.113 --> 46:13.380
This city became our spiritual capital
since the day we came to Anatolia.

46:14.113 --> 46:18.580
How many conquerors served here?

46:19.413 --> 46:23.647
And our Sultan Alparslan made his
preparations before the battle...

46:23.980 --> 46:28.180
...of Malazgirt and gathered
his army here.

46:29.113 --> 46:33.280
To take control of this city means to...

46:34.347 --> 46:36.647
...take control of the ancestors, Bey.

46:37.680 --> 46:40.713
Our ancestors built too many
blessed cities.

46:41.013 --> 46:44.380
Samarkand, Bukhara, Tabriz, Rey.

46:45.947 --> 46:49.180
I hope that there will be
a resurrection fire again.

46:49.547 --> 46:52.247
If God permits Bey.

48:08.947 --> 48:10.580
<i>With the help of God.</i>

48:11.113 --> 48:18.113
With 99 names of God
who filled our hearts with faith.

48:20.147 --> 48:24.047
My valiant men from 24 tribes
of my ancestor Oghuz.

48:26.413 --> 48:31.180
Blue sky above us and dark ground...

48:32.180 --> 48:36.947
...witness that Turkish cities are
preparing for a great resurrection.

48:40.680 --> 48:44.480
What kind of resurrection is this
when our union is broken and...

48:44.713 --> 48:47.013
...Mongolians are destroying everywhere?

48:48.513 --> 48:50.480
The darkest moment of the night is...

48:51.280 --> 48:54.080
...the closest moment to the dawn.

48:55.113 --> 49:01.480
Tough days will erase the laziness
and dreadfulness on us.

49:03.180 --> 49:05.613
It will give us a new soul.

49:07.280 --> 49:09.347
24 men of the Oghuz.

49:10.680 --> 49:15.580
Do not forget that the state is not in the
stone buildings.

49:17.247 --> 49:22.447
State is the spirit of Turks and every
Turk is a state.

49:23.547 --> 49:26.680
If there is a Turk on earth...

49:27.347 --> 49:29.980
...then it means a state for us.

49:31.480 --> 49:32.713
Thank you, Master.

49:34.380 --> 49:37.580
Well, what kind of way will we follow
to get rid of this much trouble?

49:39.647 --> 49:43.080
Tonight, it is time to talk on it.

49:45.113 --> 49:48.013
Do not forget that province goes and
tradition stays.

49:48.447 --> 49:52.980
If a nation loses its soul then
it loses everything.

49:54.280 --> 49:57.947
Some of us must die so one of us can live.

49:59.347 --> 50:04.480
It will be the night to choose who will
die and who will live.

50:14.280 --> 50:15.680
Now...

50:17.013 --> 50:23.947
...who wants to die for true order and
who wants to die for God?

50:41.113 --> 50:44.713
To be a martyr is inheritance of
our ancestors, old men.

50:45.580 --> 50:50.647
While time is passing, we do not forget to
desire to be a martyr. Thank God.

50:50.713 --> 50:52.213
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

50:53.480 --> 50:55.413
Valiant sons of Oghuz!

50:55.480 --> 50:57.647
Then it is us to choose.

50:58.013 --> 50:59.347
Are you willing to do that?

50:59.747 --> 51:01.980
Thank you.

51:04.713 --> 51:06.280
Then you will die in the battle...

51:10.313 --> 51:12.347
...and you will fight.

51:16.380 --> 51:23.380
Brothers who will die in the battle
choose your best fighters...

51:24.513 --> 51:27.013
...and when you get our orders...

51:27.547 --> 51:29.380
...fight with the Mongolians.

51:31.113 --> 51:34.513
Try to be a set for Anatolia.

51:38.713 --> 51:45.013
And you who will fight go to our lands and
conquer new places.

51:50.180 --> 51:51.347
Now say your goodbyes.

51:51.413 --> 51:53.413
Good luck with your fight.

51:53.480 --> 51:55.380
Get plenty of conquests.

52:20.647 --> 52:24.113
Ertugrul, you stay.

52:39.147 --> 52:41.247
Ertugrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

52:42.213 --> 52:44.280
I do not want to break anyone's hope.

52:44.747 --> 52:48.147
But you know that we are
in a difficult situation.

52:50.447 --> 52:54.447
And I saw the courage of many heroes
in your eyes.

52:55.980 --> 52:58.280
I am honored and happy.

52:58.580 --> 53:03.547
What do you say about the situation of
Turkish places and Islamic world?

53:04.213 --> 53:05.947
This is a big test for us.

53:06.547 --> 53:08.647
Brothers are killing each other.

53:09.280 --> 53:14.013
And if we continue to kill each other
the enemies will continue to rule.

53:15.080 --> 53:17.480
We buried our minds and hearts.

53:17.747 --> 53:19.347
We lost our minds.

53:20.080 --> 53:26.147
If a resurrection will start, we must
first regain our minds and souls.

53:27.513 --> 53:29.647
Suleyman Shah raised you well.

53:31.113 --> 53:33.480
We will have too many conversations
with you.

53:33.547 --> 53:34.713
If God permits.

53:34.947 --> 53:39.447
Now the place you will go is the next to
Byzantine.

53:40.513 --> 53:43.613
It is a very rich and untouched place.

53:44.713 --> 53:48.547
Try to move your nomad group in there.

53:49.213 --> 53:52.080
Take a look there as soon as possible.

53:53.080 --> 53:55.613
I will immediately go.

53:56.147 --> 53:58.113
Now, good bye.

54:41.184 --> 54:44.344
Our future will be as bright as this ring.

54:51.344 --> 54:53.424
The nomad group cries for Ertugrul,
father.

54:55.264 --> 54:57.464
Apparently, they see him as their savior.

54:58.424 --> 55:01.384
While we have a leash on
Gundogdu and Tugtekin...

55:01.864 --> 55:04.344
...Ertugrul cannot do
anything in the marquee.

55:08.864 --> 55:09.904
It is near.

55:10.824 --> 55:15.984
While our kids attain their desire,
Korkut will be dead and buried.

55:27.264 --> 55:28.784
Sadettin Kobek sent a letter.

55:32.384 --> 55:36.544
He says he trusts him completely and
will give him all the necessary support.

55:38.864 --> 55:40.504
All Turkmen nomad groups...

55:40.624 --> 55:43.944
...will be under the rule of
the margrave that I will establish.

55:45.384 --> 55:50.184
Neither Sultan Alaaddin
nor Ertugrul can prevent it.

55:53.704 --> 55:56.464
You know, father, this man does
not even give his sins away...

55:56.544 --> 55:58.064
...without anything in return.

55:58.184 --> 56:01.704
I cannot even imagine what you
could have done had you been born a man.

56:05.784 --> 56:09.344
As for Sadettin Kobek,
we both want the same thing.

56:12.664 --> 56:14.024
Ertugrul's dead body.

57:26.984 --> 57:29.944
You did the right thing by setting up
your own tent, sister.

57:34.064 --> 57:36.824
It would not suit you to stay
in the marquee anymore.

57:42.064 --> 57:46.424
While my Bey's tent and my
mother's marquee cannot bear me...

57:47.464 --> 57:49.904
...I do not want to be
a burden on anybody, Gokce.

57:59.144 --> 58:03.424
Try to contain your poisonous tongue,
sister...

58:07.184 --> 58:10.664
...so that you do not come down on
two newborns' houses like the plague.

58:52.824 --> 58:54.904
The only thing that we do not know is...

58:56.904 --> 59:00.384
...how far those ominous hands
of Ertugrul have reached.

59:01.744 --> 59:06.704
As I said Noyan, maybe his hands
even reached within us.

59:13.584 --> 59:14.824
Who is the traitor?

59:18.344 --> 59:22.024
Hamza or Abdurrahman?

59:31.424 --> 59:32.584
Let us see who he is.

00:59:59.224 --> 01:00:01.544
As you ordered, we killed everyone, Noyan.

01:00:06.304 --> 01:00:07.904
We brought one of them to you...

01:00:10.184 --> 01:00:12.064
...so you can learn
what you want to learn.

01:00:54.504 --> 01:00:59.224
Winds, wolves, birds,
all types of creepy creatures...

01:01:00.584 --> 01:01:02.904
...whisper in my ear whatever
I need to know, Hamza.

01:01:05.344 --> 01:01:07.384
You did not need to bother
bringing him in.

01:01:25.344 --> 01:01:27.904
You fulfilled your duties successfully.

01:01:30.984 --> 01:01:32.784
I know you are tired.

01:01:36.064 --> 01:01:37.184
Go and sleep.

01:01:40.544 --> 01:01:44.464
Tomorrow night I will meet
with my loyal dog...

01:01:44.584 --> 01:01:48.544
...my eye and my ear
in Sultan Aladdin's palace.

01:01:51.464 --> 01:01:57.144
I want you to join me
on this long road to Kurtbogazi.

01:02:00.224 --> 01:02:02.904
On the road, we can
talk about the future too.

01:02:06.464 --> 01:02:08.744
Now, I want to assign you
as commanders of a region.

01:02:10.744 --> 01:02:13.624
You proved that you will be
fearless commanders...

01:02:13.904 --> 01:02:16.424
...with the duties you have
completed up to today.

01:02:20.024 --> 01:02:21.104
Is that not so, Tankut?

01:02:22.584 --> 01:02:23.664
It is, Noyan.

01:02:27.704 --> 01:02:28.704
Go now.

01:02:30.024 --> 01:02:32.544
Concubines will give you a good wash.

01:02:34.064 --> 01:02:35.824
Tomorrow come to me with full energy.

01:02:36.704 --> 01:02:38.024
We have a long road.

01:02:40.384 --> 01:02:41.384
Thank you!

01:03:04.984 --> 01:03:08.384
<i>We will see which one of them</i>
 <i>will bring Ertugrul to me.</i>

01:04:04.704 --> 01:04:05.784
Aktolgali...

01:04:11.464 --> 01:04:14.104
...will roses bloom in this land one day?

01:04:16.304 --> 01:04:17.824
Will nightingales sing?

01:04:20.104 --> 01:04:26.384
Will our mares, boys and girls be happy?

01:04:27.984 --> 01:04:30.144
Will the cries of this land ever cease?

01:04:30.824 --> 01:04:32.504
Will Mahsuns be Dilshad?

01:04:34.024 --> 01:04:36.464
Will we be united under the crescent?

01:04:39.624 --> 01:04:42.864
Unity and peace will be reached,
Aktolgali.

01:04:43.904 --> 01:04:47.144
The flag of justice will be flying under
the crescent.

01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:51.264
As long as we remain
on the side of justice.

01:04:52.264 --> 01:04:54.784
As long as we do not lose our humanity.

01:04:55.904 --> 01:05:00.144
As long as we keep our passion
for the cause alive.

01:05:09.264 --> 01:05:11.304
May God lessen the burden on you,
valiant one.

01:05:34.984 --> 01:05:35.984
Yes, mother?

01:05:48.304 --> 01:05:50.784
I hope nothing is wrong, mother.
Is there a problem?

01:05:52.944 --> 01:05:55.464
I have nothing else
to think about except you, son.

01:05:56.344 --> 01:05:59.944
Thank God, we are all well.

01:06:01.264 --> 01:06:02.384
Thankfully.

01:06:04.504 --> 01:06:06.464
Your wedding with Goncagul is close.

01:06:07.584 --> 01:06:10.864
May God make you and her happy
and feel the peace in both worlds.

01:06:13.584 --> 01:06:18.344
You are the son of a Bey.
You have to do everything correctly.

01:06:22.824 --> 01:06:28.624
Look, son, Selcan is your woman
and my daughter.

01:06:29.504 --> 01:06:31.104
Do not throw her into a corner.

01:06:35.744 --> 01:06:38.744
You are right. You are right, mother.

01:06:40.064 --> 01:06:41.624
But I don't know what to do.

01:06:43.384 --> 01:06:45.504
Always ask her how she is.

01:06:47.584 --> 01:06:48.824
Do not neglect her.

01:06:49.784 --> 01:06:54.344
While she is alone in her tent,
let her feel the breath of her man.

01:06:56.104 --> 01:06:58.344
Both her and the people.

01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:02.224
Your wish is my command, mother.

01:07:45.624 --> 01:07:47.864
What are you saying?
Bamsi brother, get up.

01:07:48.944 --> 01:07:51.584
I am resting, why are you rushing me?

01:07:57.464 --> 01:08:00.144
Leave me alone, do not make me get up.

01:08:00.904 --> 01:08:02.264
Dogan, leave Bamsi alone.

01:08:07.024 --> 01:08:08.024
Brother!

01:08:08.864 --> 01:08:10.944
Do not force me to take you by pieces.

01:08:24.464 --> 01:08:25.744
I will catch you now!

01:08:26.264 --> 01:08:27.704
Do not try to run away!

01:08:28.424 --> 01:08:29.864
Do not try to run away, Dogan!

01:08:30.104 --> 01:08:32.224
Come here! Dogan, come here!

01:08:32.904 --> 01:08:34.584
Do not try to run away! Come here!

01:08:35.704 --> 01:08:37.864
Come here! Dogan, come here!

01:08:38.904 --> 01:08:40.104
Dogan come here!

01:08:40.424 --> 01:08:41.744
Come here!

01:08:44.064 --> 01:08:45.264
Come here!

01:08:47.944 --> 01:08:49.024
Come here!

01:08:50.224 --> 01:08:51.224
Come here!

01:08:57.504 --> 01:08:58.704
Come here right now!

01:09:04.984 --> 01:09:05.984
Bamsi!

01:09:23.464 --> 01:09:25.104
Now I am burning, Bamsi brother.

01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:28.344
Burning in flames, brother.

01:09:28.904 --> 01:09:30.264
Burning in flames.

01:09:35.984 --> 01:09:38.104
So, a bird of love has landed
on your heart, brother.

01:09:39.184 --> 01:09:41.584
From now on, you will never feel at ease.

01:09:43.824 --> 01:09:45.384
You were so ashamed.

01:10:03.224 --> 01:10:07.384
Death is galloping towards us on
the back of a furious horse.

01:10:11.104 --> 01:10:13.904
Being Bey and Hanim is only good
to some extent, Gokce.

01:10:18.104 --> 01:10:20.704
Marquee is not going to be our graves...

01:10:20.824 --> 01:10:23.584
...but it will be the cradle of
your and Tugtekin's children.

01:10:26.184 --> 01:10:30.144
It will be a mitt to Turkmen and
home to Oghuz, if God permits.

01:10:31.344 --> 01:10:32.344
If God permits.

01:10:34.424 --> 01:10:40.224
As long as you stay beside your man
in hard times like these.

01:10:42.944 --> 01:10:47.424
Bey Tugtekin is both my home
and grave, Aytolun Ana.

01:10:55.704 --> 01:10:59.824
Hanim, I want to show some drapes
to our new bride.

01:11:18.904 --> 01:11:21.064
-Welcome, Banu Cicek.
-Thank you, Hanim.

01:11:24.824 --> 01:11:27.264
How is your sister who went to be
a bride of Avshar's?

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:29.744
-Did she recover?
-With your help, Hanim.

01:11:32.304 --> 01:11:35.024
You came a long way, go and rest.

01:11:35.464 --> 01:11:37.344
I guess you have things
to do in the marquee.

01:11:37.944 --> 01:11:40.544
Maybe you heard,
the Kayis took refuge with us.

01:11:42.384 --> 01:11:43.584
I heard, Hanim.

01:11:45.224 --> 01:11:50.704
Due to being united with the furious
Turkmen, your job is harder than ever.

01:11:50.824 --> 01:11:51.824
You know that.

01:12:46.024 --> 01:12:48.184
My God, how will I approach this woman?

01:13:27.464 --> 01:13:30.024
-Selcan Hatun.
-Yes, my Bey?

01:13:44.184 --> 01:13:45.224
Yes, my Bey?

01:13:48.904 --> 01:13:50.824
Even if our tents are separate...

01:13:50.944 --> 01:13:54.024
...mother has reminded me that
you are still my woman.

01:13:55.184 --> 01:13:56.184
She is right.

01:13:57.424 --> 01:14:00.544
Even if I take Goncagul as my wife,
I will stay in your tent some nights.

01:14:00.664 --> 01:14:01.864
Just so you know.

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:13.144
If you cannot hold your tongue and
yourself again, the situation will change.

01:14:13.264 --> 01:14:14.624
Be warned.

01:14:36.944 --> 01:14:38.024
What do you want?

01:14:39.224 --> 01:14:43.624
All I want is a peaceful life with
Bey Gundogdu, Selcan Hatun!

01:14:44.984 --> 01:14:46.664
Is there anyone preventing it?

01:14:47.704 --> 01:14:50.544
Give him the things that
I cannot give my Bey.

01:14:51.184 --> 01:14:54.984
Give them so that you will be happy
and age in your tent together.

01:14:57.984 --> 01:15:01.984
<i>If you cannot hold your tongue and</i>
 <i>yourself, the situation will change.</i>

01:15:02.344 --> 01:15:03.664
<i>Be warned!</i>

01:15:05.464 --> 01:15:08.544
This is not going to happen
while you are around obviously.

01:15:15.264 --> 01:15:18.944
Go your own way, Goncagul go your own way.

01:15:19.944 --> 01:15:24.144
I will enter the bridal chamber
with your husband, Selcan Hatun.

01:15:25.864 --> 01:15:29.824
I do not want your shadow in my tent
or your smell in my bed. Be warned!

01:15:31.064 --> 01:15:36.064
Because I know what kind
of a distorted woman you are.

01:15:37.544 --> 01:15:38.584
Look at me.

01:15:40.704 --> 01:15:42.664
I know people like you very well.

01:15:44.144 --> 01:15:46.664
Like the dust kicked off of by a horse...

01:15:46.784 --> 01:15:50.584
...you will turn into mud with
the first rain and smear my boots.

01:15:52.464 --> 01:15:56.264
You will disgust me until
I go to a river and wash it off.

01:15:58.784 --> 01:16:01.184
And then you will be forgotten for good.

01:16:04.664 --> 01:16:05.664
Go your own way.

01:16:06.624 --> 01:16:08.344
I do not want to break your heart.

01:16:10.904 --> 01:16:12.784
I know that you killed that old woman.

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:21.064
What are you saying?

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:25.464
The necklace you gave her
was on her dead body.

01:16:38.904 --> 01:16:42.984
When the poor woman did not want to
take it, you obviously killed her.

01:16:45.744 --> 01:16:49.224
The necklace you gave her is proof.
I have it.

01:16:52.544 --> 01:16:54.384
I did not say anything not to make you...

01:16:54.504 --> 01:16:57.144
...more ashamed in the eyes of my Bey,
Selcan Hatun.

01:16:57.664 --> 01:17:02.064
However, with your smallest mistake...

01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:08.464
...Bey Gundogdu, Bey Korkut,
and Mother Hayme will learn the truth.

01:17:11.624 --> 01:17:13.984
I would have you executed
at the headquarters, Selcan.

01:17:17.184 --> 01:17:20.584
Stay away from us and our happiness.

01:17:44.784 --> 01:17:46.984
Alps, Bey Gundogdu!

01:18:00.984 --> 01:18:03.744
Valiant ones, how are you?

01:18:03.984 --> 01:18:05.904
-Thank you, my Bey!
-Thank you, my Bey!

01:18:17.024 --> 01:18:18.784
On one side...

01:18:20.264 --> 01:18:22.224
...the Alps of the Kayi group...

01:18:23.624 --> 01:18:27.544
...on the other side,
the Alps of the Dodurga group.

01:18:29.824 --> 01:18:31.904
They are both on my side.

01:18:34.584 --> 01:18:35.984
However...

01:18:38.664 --> 01:18:41.224
...I want to see it for the last time.

01:18:43.744 --> 01:18:45.104
Karakhanids...

01:18:46.464 --> 01:18:48.024
...Ghaznevids...

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:50.344
...Khwarzemids...

01:18:51.104 --> 01:18:52.744
...Seljuks of Iraq.

01:18:55.984 --> 01:19:00.624
All of these were the sons
of the same forefather...

01:19:00.744 --> 01:19:02.464
...the ancestors.

01:19:05.304 --> 01:19:06.744
What happened to them?

01:19:09.744 --> 01:19:11.064
They became a state.

01:19:13.944 --> 01:19:19.704
However, when they became
a state they fell apart.

01:19:22.664 --> 01:19:26.824
They let the tyrants and infidels in.

01:19:30.064 --> 01:19:33.984
Boris, seignior of Erbil...

01:19:36.664 --> 01:19:39.264
...Zengis, Salgurlus.

01:19:40.744 --> 01:19:42.104
They also became seigniors.

01:19:44.784 --> 01:19:47.584
But they could not make it either.

01:19:50.944 --> 01:19:57.664
Sons of the same forefather and
ancestors have only one salvation.

01:20:00.024 --> 01:20:01.264
To be united.

01:20:02.544 --> 01:20:03.544
To be united.

01:20:05.944 --> 01:20:07.624
There is no other salvation.

01:20:12.904 --> 01:20:13.904
This is true.

01:20:16.264 --> 01:20:18.864
We are...

01:20:20.184 --> 01:20:23.704
...two glorious nomad groups of Oghuz.

01:20:25.024 --> 01:20:28.024
Until we separate our ways...

01:20:29.384 --> 01:20:31.424
...our Alps...

01:20:32.304 --> 01:20:37.424
...will belong to the same army,
the same tribe.

01:20:41.224 --> 01:20:42.344
From now on...

01:20:43.184 --> 01:20:48.064
...the Alps of two tribes do not exist.

01:20:49.864 --> 01:20:55.224
There are only
the valiant Alps of my forefather Oghuz...

01:20:56.944 --> 01:21:01.144
...invincible veterans...

01:21:02.904 --> 01:21:04.624
...and martyrs of Islam.

01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:16.424
We will face the Mongols with
this martyrdom, understood?

01:21:16.984 --> 01:21:18.784
-Understood, my Bey!
-Understood, my Bey!

01:21:21.024 --> 01:21:23.504
Alright. Show it then.

01:21:42.864 --> 01:21:46.104
May God clear your way.

01:21:49.544 --> 01:21:51.144
God bless you!

01:21:51.344 --> 01:21:52.544
Amen!

01:21:58.544 --> 01:22:00.104
Gundogdu is a good commander.

01:22:03.904 --> 01:22:08.104
However, you are as good as him.
Do not be offended.

01:22:08.864 --> 01:22:11.984
You are the hope of the Dodurga
as he is the hope of the Kayi.

01:22:15.544 --> 01:22:17.344
Everybody pays a price, Bey Musteki.

01:22:19.424 --> 01:22:22.064
I paid this price with my stubbornness.

01:22:41.384 --> 01:22:42.384
Where is Dogan?

01:22:54.984 --> 01:22:55.984
Forgive me, my Bey.

01:22:57.344 --> 01:23:00.184
What is happening, Dogan?
What is this tardiness?

01:23:01.784 --> 01:23:02.784
My Bey...

01:23:04.224 --> 01:23:06.864
...love makes one either a fool or proud.

01:23:08.144 --> 01:23:09.344
It makes this one a fool.

01:23:17.664 --> 01:23:18.664
Do not repeat it.

01:23:21.464 --> 01:23:22.464
Yes, my Bey!

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:51.024
Alps!

01:23:53.344 --> 01:23:56.784
Bey Tugtekin has recovered and joined us.

01:23:58.264 --> 01:23:59.744
For Bey Tugtekin...

01:24:02.384 --> 01:24:03.704
...for Bey Gundogdu.

01:24:06.024 --> 01:24:09.704
-Long live Bey Gundogdu.
-Long live Bey Gundogdu.

01:24:10.264 --> 01:24:13.824
-Long live Bey Tugtekin.
-Long live Bey Tugtekin.

01:24:14.024 --> 01:24:17.664
-Long live Bey Gundogdu.
-Long live Bey Gundogdu.

01:24:17.944 --> 01:24:21.104
-Long live Bey Tugtekin.
-Long live Bey Tugtekin.

01:24:21.464 --> 01:24:24.864
-Long live Bey Gundogdu .
-Long live Bey Gundogdu.

01:24:25.464 --> 01:24:28.784
-Long live Bey Tugtekin.
-Long live Bey Tugtekin.

01:24:29.384 --> 01:24:32.864
-Long live Bey Gundogdu.
-Long live Bey Gundogdu.

01:24:42.384 --> 01:24:43.744
These are very beautiful.

01:24:49.744 --> 01:24:52.344
This fabric will look very good on you,
Gokce Hatun.

01:24:53.384 --> 01:24:55.144
What does not look good
on the beautiful one?

01:24:56.664 --> 01:24:58.384
Praise be, for both of you.

01:25:09.704 --> 01:25:12.704
We say it's nice but what will
our sweethearts say?

01:25:15.504 --> 01:25:20.624
Hatuns, tell me,
what will a man tell his woman?

01:25:21.344 --> 01:25:25.264
Shining brightly in a fine tone...

01:25:25.384 --> 01:25:28.824
...my tall beauty sashays.

01:25:29.184 --> 01:25:30.704
What else does he say?

01:25:31.264 --> 01:25:35.784
Her cheeks are red like
blood dripped onto the snow.

01:25:36.104 --> 01:25:37.224
What else?

01:25:37.784 --> 01:25:41.584
The one with the tiny mouth
in which two almonds can't fit...

01:25:41.784 --> 01:25:45.784
...her eyebrows were
drawn by calligraphists.

01:25:46.304 --> 01:25:49.504
And her hair with color of dun.

01:25:51.344 --> 01:25:56.024
So, set up a clear marquee
in black lands...

01:25:56.744 --> 01:25:59.584
...may your bridal chamber bring
glory to the Oghuz tribe.

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:48.744
Selcan.

01:26:50.464 --> 01:26:53.224
Selcan, are you alright my daughter?

01:26:58.784 --> 01:27:01.504
What else does one want from God...

01:27:01.624 --> 01:27:04.544
...after seeing the happiness of
the people she loves, mother?

01:27:06.144 --> 01:27:09.064
For me, it is to see
the marriage of my sister and my Bey.

01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:18.624
<i>Han of Hans, Ogeday,</i>

01:28:19.664 --> 01:28:24.784
<i>I follow every step</i>
 <i>Noyan takes, as you ordered.</i>

01:28:28.984 --> 01:28:31.544
<i>He is helpless against Ertugrul.</i>

01:28:32.344 --> 01:28:37.944
<i>If it goes that way, it is not possible</i>
 <i>for our army to pass Erzurum.</i>

01:28:39.184 --> 01:28:42.984
<i>I will write you</i>
 <i>about the precautions to be taken.</i>

01:28:44.344 --> 01:28:45.384
<i>Tangut.</i>

01:29:32.704 --> 01:29:33.704
Tangut?

01:29:37.704 --> 01:29:38.984
-Tangut?
-What?

01:29:39.904 --> 01:29:41.744
Tangut. Hamza is still asleep.

01:29:43.024 --> 01:29:44.424
But Abdurrahman is not here.

01:30:41.624 --> 01:30:43.784
-How many coins is this, uncle?
-Five coins.

01:30:44.784 --> 01:30:45.784
It is too much.

01:30:48.024 --> 01:30:49.584
Who are you watching secretly?

01:30:52.224 --> 01:30:54.224
What is this?
Are you looking for an infidel?

01:30:57.704 --> 01:30:58.704
Shut up!

01:31:03.384 --> 01:31:05.464
The person he is watching
is obvious, brother.

01:31:07.464 --> 01:31:09.144
Yes, I understand, brother.

01:31:09.264 --> 01:31:13.504
Dogan, we lost our minds in
the way of defeating infidels...

01:31:13.624 --> 01:31:15.624
...you will lose yours in the way of love.

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:20.744
Why don't you go to the training stable?
Find an Alp your size and wrestle him.

01:31:22.864 --> 01:31:25.064
-How much is this?
-I can give it to you for four coins.

01:31:25.624 --> 01:31:26.624
It is too much.

01:31:27.264 --> 01:31:29.864
If you are willing to buy it,
I can give it to you for three.

01:31:35.384 --> 01:31:40.304
Brother, let it go, Banu Cicek is leaving.
Go, brother, tell your wish to her.

01:31:40.424 --> 01:31:41.424
Go.

01:31:42.624 --> 01:31:44.664
Go and talk to her. Go.

01:31:44.784 --> 01:31:45.784
Go.

01:31:57.344 --> 01:31:59.704
-Thank you. May it be easy.
-Thank you.

01:32:00.224 --> 01:32:03.904
-The pot must be heavy, let me help you.
-No, I do not need help. Thank you.

01:32:04.024 --> 01:32:05.464
Go and help people who are in need.

01:32:05.984 --> 01:32:08.384
No, let me help you,
I will not feel at ease.

01:32:08.504 --> 01:32:10.504
-Let it go.
-No, let me help.

01:32:10.584 --> 01:32:12.064
It is not necessary, thank you.

01:32:12.184 --> 01:32:14.384
My heart will not feel at ease,
let me take it.

01:32:29.424 --> 01:32:30.704
Thank you for your help.

01:32:36.304 --> 01:32:37.304
I am so sorry.

01:32:44.504 --> 01:32:45.744
You broke the pot.

01:32:48.544 --> 01:32:50.544
-What are you laughing at?
-What?

01:32:50.664 --> 01:32:54.944
We just sneezed, sneezed.
What is it with you?

01:33:11.904 --> 01:33:13.944
Go to the nomad tent
and let Ertugrul know.

01:33:14.064 --> 01:33:17.064
Noyan will meet with his spy
in the Sultan's palace.

01:33:17.664 --> 01:33:19.544
They will be at Kurtbogazi tomorrow night.

01:33:20.144 --> 01:33:23.984
Bey Ertugrul's orders, it is done now,
brother Abdurrahman.

01:33:24.424 --> 01:33:27.664
You will not go back to dishonest Noyan.

01:33:27.944 --> 01:33:31.344
-What are you saying, Geyikli?
-Bey Ertugrul is suspicious.

01:33:32.024 --> 01:33:34.544
He thinks that Noyan knows
what your intention is.

01:33:37.304 --> 01:33:39.024
He wants you to go back to the nomad tent.

01:33:44.664 --> 01:33:45.784
I know.

01:33:46.624 --> 01:33:50.224
Bey Ertugrul thinks of me, thanks to him.

01:33:51.384 --> 01:33:54.064
However, Noyan is not
suspicious of me. I know.

01:33:55.904 --> 01:33:58.784
If I do not go back,
we cannot find the traitor...

01:33:58.904 --> 01:34:01.064
...that sold the nation and the state.

01:34:02.104 --> 01:34:03.944
What if Bey Ertugrul is right?

01:34:08.184 --> 01:34:11.144
Does not my Bey always say
fate protects people from death?

01:34:11.864 --> 01:34:16.104
If death comes,
what can we do as human beings?

01:34:19.144 --> 01:34:21.584
Give greetings to my Bey and my brothers.

01:34:22.664 --> 01:34:23.704
Hope for the best.

01:34:40.504 --> 01:34:42.304
May God be with you.

01:34:43.104 --> 01:34:44.864
Brother Abdurrahman.

01:35:03.346 --> 01:35:04.413
Brothers!

01:35:05.046 --> 01:35:08.013
I just came back from the duty
that Ertugrul Bey gave me.

01:35:10.013 --> 01:35:12.580
But I am very bored. Why?

01:35:13.046 --> 01:35:14.580
Because I was not able to cut
any non-Muslims.

01:35:20.513 --> 01:35:24.546
So I have intention of going back
to nomad tent and eat some food.

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:29.780
Brothers, right in that time
a sound came to my ear.

01:35:31.013 --> 01:35:34.780
I said God, finally expected
non-Muslims are coming, Bamsi.

01:35:36.413 --> 01:35:40.913
Brothers, I got my weapon
and jump into bushes.

01:35:41.546 --> 01:35:43.913
I said with the name of God

01:35:44.813 --> 01:35:48.346
but person behind tree
was not a non-Muslim.

01:35:50.446 --> 01:35:51.480
What was it?

01:35:51.813 --> 01:35:52.946
It was a bear.

01:35:53.546 --> 01:35:54.646
It was a bear.

01:35:56.746 --> 01:35:57.813
A bear!

01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:03.480
Whatever brothers, I said, does not matter
either it is a non-Muslim or a bear.

01:36:04.313 --> 01:36:07.913
I got my weapon, united my hands
and started to hit.

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:10.646
Hitting again and hitting again!

01:36:11.446 --> 01:36:13.480
Brothers, bear escaped!

01:36:16.713 --> 01:36:19.513
Since that day
Bamsi became a bear as well.

01:36:57.413 --> 01:37:00.080
-Welcome, Artuk Bey.
-Thank you, my Bey, you also welcome.

01:37:01.946 --> 01:37:04.980
-Did you bring my cure?
-Yes, I did.

01:37:05.913 --> 01:37:06.980
Come and lay down.

01:37:44.646 --> 01:37:47.813
I put ointment onto carbuncle on your leg.

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.480
Let it penetrate into your wound.

01:38:00.346 --> 01:38:03.680
Come here before you go to bed
then we will clean this pus well.

01:38:04.713 --> 01:38:06.746
In the morning we will clean
the remained part.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:10.046
Then you will be recovered.
It will cure your leg.

01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:37.513
Peace be upon you.

01:38:37.846 --> 01:38:39.280
And peace be upon you, my Bey.

01:38:42.946 --> 01:38:45.513
-I hope your joy will be permanent.
-Amen, my Bey.

01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:46.846
Thank you, my Bey.

01:38:57.946 --> 01:38:59.080
Dogan...

01:39:00.646 --> 01:39:02.413
...I hope nothing is wrong?
I see you silent.

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:05.746
He is in love, my Bey, he is in love.

01:39:17.046 --> 01:39:18.946
My Bey, you must be tired.

01:39:21.613 --> 01:39:23.980
But we have a guest,
a poet from Bayirbucak.

01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:29.313
You may wish to join us.

01:39:29.913 --> 01:39:31.846
-Welcome, brother.
-Thank you, Bey.

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.080
Begin.

01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:41.813
<i>Smoke collapsed</i>
 <i>On the top of Red Mountain</i>

01:39:42.646 --> 01:39:44.980
<i>Martyr's given to its land and rocks</i>

01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:47.713
<i>They did not mind tears</i>

01:39:48.513 --> 01:39:50.480
<i>They cried and went to Turkmen mountain</i>

01:39:51.513 --> 01:39:53.446
<i>Enemies go around 45 mountains</i>

01:39:53.713 --> 01:39:55.680
<i>They go and make trouble to Turkmen</i>

01:39:55.913 --> 01:39:57.846
<i>Mothers and sisters cry to their martyr</i>

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.413
<i>They cauterized Turkmen mountain</i>

01:40:01.546 --> 01:40:03.880
<i>They hit and exiled us from nomad tent</i>

01:40:04.613 --> 01:40:06.613
<i>May dear God gives us strength</i>

01:40:07.313 --> 01:40:09.280
<i>Even if we die</i>
 <i>We will not renounce from here</i>

01:40:09.913 --> 01:40:11.780
<i>They destroyed Turkmen mountain</i>

01:40:12.946 --> 01:40:14.980
<i>Grandsons of Alparslan, Suleyman Shah</i>

01:40:15.513 --> 01:40:17.713
<i>Mothers delivered them like leonine</i>

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.713
<i>They sacrificed their lives for us</i>

01:40:20.346 --> 01:40:22.380
<i>They made Turkmen mountain home</i>

01:40:22.946 --> 01:40:25.680
<i>Turkmen, do not lose your hope from God</i>

01:40:26.346 --> 01:40:28.546
<i>This beautiful homeland is heritage</i>
 <i>From forefather</i>

01:40:28.913 --> 01:40:31.980
<i>There will be triumph</i>
 <i>There will be triumph</i>

01:40:32.446 --> 01:40:35.513
<i>Write Turkmen mountain to the history</i>

01:40:38.746 --> 01:40:40.413
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:40:45.346 --> 01:40:47.446
-Well said, brother.
-Thank you, Bey.

01:40:56.646 --> 01:40:57.780
I hope nothing is wrong, Geyikli?

01:40:58.046 --> 01:41:00.680
My Bey, Abdurrahman has news.

01:41:23.646 --> 01:41:28.746
I will not surrender to you
and your fickle aunt.

01:42:00.413 --> 01:42:01.413
Look, daughter.

01:42:04.746 --> 01:42:09.080
Gundogdu is son of Suleyman Shah,
brother of Ertugrul.

01:42:11.413 --> 01:42:15.513
If we come to a bad point
it is me to cut it off.

01:42:17.546 --> 01:42:19.480
Then I do not want you to cry.

01:42:21.946 --> 01:42:23.046
Do you understand?

01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:29.480
We took an oath to keep unity of Oghuz.

01:42:30.646 --> 01:42:32.380
Do not forget it.

01:42:40.013 --> 01:42:43.380
Do not you know until today I have
faced with many things for you, father?

01:42:45.546 --> 01:42:48.513
Then be aware of that
I will be doing from now on.

01:42:49.746 --> 01:42:51.380
Do not make your mother-in-law wait.

01:43:57.713 --> 01:44:00.813
<i>Even if I marry with Goncagul,</i>
 <i>I will be staying in your tent some days.</i>

01:44:01.313 --> 01:44:02.380
<i>You know that.</i>

01:44:03.946 --> 01:44:07.580
<i>If you cannot hold your tongue</i>
 <i>and yourself, this will change.</i>

01:44:08.046 --> 01:44:09.046
<i>You know that.</i>

01:44:30.413 --> 01:44:31.513
What is the matter, Bey?

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.846
Abdurrahman brought news from Noyan.

01:44:36.646 --> 01:44:39.380
Then he said he will not be suspicious
of me and left to go back there.

01:44:41.713 --> 01:44:44.013
Then Abdurrahman must be in
a big trouble, Bey.

01:44:45.913 --> 01:44:47.546
Noyan played his last game.

01:44:48.646 --> 01:44:49.880
He is going to kill him.

01:44:50.046 --> 01:44:51.613
I am sure he will
not kill him immediately.

01:44:52.746 --> 01:44:54.813
He will enjoy of killing of Abdurrahman.

01:44:55.746 --> 01:44:57.080
What are you thinking, Bey?

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.480
Now it is the time.

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.013
We will attack to Noyan.
-How is it going to happen?

01:45:06.646 --> 01:45:08.946
Noyan will understand he cannot exist
in these mountains

01:45:09.613 --> 01:45:11.846
and cannot attack to Turkmen nomad groups.

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.480
-With God's name.
-With God's name.

01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:32.580
Thank you.

01:46:03.413 --> 01:46:04.980
Thanks to God

01:46:06.713 --> 01:46:09.613
my little table keeps growing.

01:46:12.446 --> 01:46:17.446
Became more joyful
with my brides and grooms.

01:46:20.513 --> 01:46:24.446
If God permits Ertugrul and Halime
will be in our table.

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:28.446
And then Sungurtekin.

01:46:29.546 --> 01:46:31.446
If God permits, mother. If God permits.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.546
If God permits. If God permits.

01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:39.746
I have heard of heroic stories of Kayi

01:46:41.046 --> 01:46:44.313
while I have been growing from
both my father and forefather.

01:46:47.446 --> 01:46:50.646
I have given my daughter

01:46:51.346 --> 01:46:55.646
to this such honest and valiant
nomad group thankfully.

01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.380
I will not leave anything undone.

01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:07.813
My daughter married with a valiant
such Gundogdu Bey.

01:47:09.013 --> 01:47:11.080
From now on, it becomes my festival.

01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.546
Thank you, my Bey, thank you.

01:47:18.846 --> 01:47:22.580
When we see marriage of
Gokce Hatun and Tugtekin

01:47:22.746 --> 01:47:24.413
it will become our festival then.

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.846
Thank you, brother, thank you.

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:31.713
But do not forget that only thing
makes me happy

01:47:33.346 --> 01:47:35.946
is not taking such a beautiful
woman, Gokce Hatun.

01:47:38.346 --> 01:47:40.280
Dear God took my mother from me too early.

01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:46.613
Thankfully I have two mothers now.

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.680
Dishonest Mongolians
took two of my brothers.

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.480
However my dear God gave me two brothers.

01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:00.980
Gundogdu Bey and Ertugrul Bey.

01:48:03.413 --> 01:48:04.413
Thank you.

01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:14.613
I see that grief of yesterday
grows hopes of today.

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:20.413
I can hear powerful steps of tomorrow.

01:48:22.813 --> 01:48:27.046
We will see the united power of
two nomad groups, if God permits.

01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:31.513
-If God permits, if God permits.
-If God permits.

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:33.446
If God permits.

01:48:56.446 --> 01:48:59.546
Stop in a place!
My head is turning because of you!

01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:01.413
I do not know where to stop!

01:49:01.646 --> 01:49:03.580
God knows what Noyan will do
to Abdurrahman.

01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:04.913
Shut up!

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:08.280
My bey will not let Abdurrahman be wasted.
I know it.

01:49:09.013 --> 01:49:10.446
He will find a solution.

01:49:42.046 --> 01:49:43.379
Today I am tired.

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:48.913
Will you excuse me, maybe you have
things to talk with my father.

01:49:51.046 --> 01:49:52.613
Of course, daughter. Go and rest.

01:49:53.913 --> 01:49:55.413
Let me join you until the marquee.

01:50:17.946 --> 01:50:22.346
For years I have been serving
to Sultan in palace.

01:50:23.513 --> 01:50:25.980
Only thing I care was my duty.

01:50:27.346 --> 01:50:31.346
I have not even noticed
my growing daughter.

01:50:33.446 --> 01:50:36.980
When I returned to nomad tent,
my daughter grown up

01:50:37.313 --> 01:50:39.646
and became in the age of being a bride.

01:50:42.546 --> 01:50:45.380
It will not be easy for me
to get used to it.

01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:53.846
Whatever, things I say are
just words of a father.

01:50:58.613 --> 01:51:00.746
If Goncagul immigrates with you

01:51:03.046 --> 01:51:04.446
I will be totally alone.

01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:12.313
Anytime you want
we always have place for you

01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:14.513
in our marquee, Gumustekin Bey.

01:51:17.746 --> 01:51:21.513
When you come to nomad tent
we all hated you.

01:51:23.646 --> 01:51:26.613
However, we became relatives now.

01:51:27.913 --> 01:51:30.046
You are one of our family now.

01:51:31.813 --> 01:51:32.813
Thank you.

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:36.913
It comes from your
great heart, Hayme Hatun.

01:51:38.313 --> 01:51:39.313
Thank you.

01:51:41.746 --> 01:51:45.380
Maybe disaster happened to Kayi family

01:51:45.846 --> 01:51:49.980
became something good for being united.

01:51:55.480 --> 01:52:02.413
You always mention of unity of
Kayi and Dodurga.

01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:10.480
Gumustekin Bey, we got united for winter.

01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:15.346
Do not exaggerate this brotherhood
in your eye.

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:25.613
We are the two nomad groups that
have most valiant men of Oghuz tribe.

01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:29.513
Why do not keep our unity
forever, Hayme Hatun?

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:34.346
Unity comes from fate against
Mongolians violence

01:52:35.746 --> 01:52:40.046
can be a good opportunity to carry us
to margrave, who knows?

01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:48.713
You are talking about a margrave that
is connected to Seljuq Empire

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:51.913
and Alaeddin Sultan, right, Bey?

01:52:54.546 --> 01:52:57.613
Of course Hayme Hatun, of course.

01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:05.346
Strength of Kayi comes from
not bending for anyone.

01:53:07.513 --> 01:53:10.880
Whosoever goes after this dream

01:53:12.846 --> 01:53:15.913
I can see they will bend for
who from now on.

01:54:44.813 --> 01:54:46.813
<i>-Peace be upon you.</i>
 <i>-And peace be upon you.</i>

01:55:36.946 --> 01:55:39.280
-Gundogdu Bey?
-Yes, Goncagul Hatun.

01:55:50.446 --> 01:55:52.746
Know that I am thankful to dear God

01:55:53.946 --> 01:55:55.913
due to meeting with
such a valiant like you.

01:55:58.413 --> 01:56:03.546
I am thankful because of you as such
an understanding and discreet woman.

01:56:04.513 --> 01:56:05.613
Thank you.

01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:11.946
Have a nice sleep, my Bey.

01:56:13.046 --> 01:56:14.046
You too.

01:57:45.313 --> 01:57:47.846
Dear God, protect me from slanders

01:57:48.413 --> 01:57:51.380
and Gundogdu Bey from sin of that
termagant woman!

01:58:08.913 --> 01:58:10.680
You even fight with your shadow, woman.

01:58:12.513 --> 01:58:13.613
What can I say.

01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:16.346
God may give you wisdom.

01:58:54.646 --> 01:58:55.780
Everybody has left, mother.

01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:59.680
Yes, son, Gokce went to bed also.

01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:01.680
Come and sit here.

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:08.080
So tell me, mother

01:59:08.846 --> 01:59:11.913
did you think long and hard of
your bride and relative?

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:16.513
Gumustekin is a prestigious man

01:59:17.313 --> 01:59:20.680
that had vital positions
in palace of Seljukian.

01:59:23.446 --> 01:59:25.580
His respect for us is in the proper place.

01:59:27.513 --> 01:59:31.480
Nurture of my daughter, Goncagul
pleases me.

01:59:33.946 --> 01:59:36.546
What a mother wishes for
her son more, right?

01:59:38.546 --> 01:59:39.580
Thank you, mother.

01:59:40.946 --> 01:59:42.280
However...

01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:51.080
...Gumustekin is a man
that smelled air of palace a lot.

01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:54.680
We have seen in Aleppo.

01:59:56.513 --> 02:00:00.880
Dirt and dust of this palace
comes front of eye of person

02:00:01.913 --> 02:00:04.080
that disables to see
what is necessary to see.

02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:09.413
Keep your eyes always open.

02:00:18.846 --> 02:00:19.913
Ertugrul.

02:00:21.446 --> 02:00:23.280
Welcome, son.
-Thank you, mother.

02:00:30.846 --> 02:00:32.846
-Welcome, brother.
-Thank you, brother.

02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:37.846
Son, you look tired, are you hungry?
I can prepare something to eat.

02:00:38.946 --> 02:00:40.046
No, mother.

02:00:41.613 --> 02:00:42.913
I have things to say to you.

02:00:44.846 --> 02:00:45.913
Sit down.

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:58.280
Noyan wants to set a trap
by using Abdurrahman.

02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:01.480
Did he learn about Abdurrahman?

02:01:03.646 --> 02:01:05.746
You want to trap him with his own trap.

02:01:06.913 --> 02:01:09.546
From now on, no more escaping
like a wounded bird, brother.

02:01:12.313 --> 02:01:13.313
What are we going to do?

02:01:16.346 --> 02:01:19.546
There is no word to say
patience in heart left.

02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:25.913
I say to cut things with sword
that tongue cannot handle.

02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:29.613
It is time to make a war.

02:01:33.713 --> 02:01:37.480
You mean to attack to cantonment of Noyan?

02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:45.546
What do you say, Gundogdu?

02:01:47.846 --> 02:01:49.280
My brother is right.

02:01:51.713 --> 02:01:54.480
It is obvious that he wants to hit
Noyan from both ways

02:01:55.546 --> 02:01:58.580
with his traps and his cantonment.

02:01:59.813 --> 02:02:01.013
Yes, I say it, brother.

02:02:03.713 --> 02:02:07.546
Then we need to talk and persuade Beys

02:02:08.446 --> 02:02:13.446
show the world
what can two nomad groups do

02:02:14.013 --> 02:02:15.580
when they are united.

02:04:16.613 --> 02:04:20.980
I gave you the opportunity of being
a honest commander

02:04:22.613 --> 02:04:24.646
in the empire of Ogeday.

02:04:27.446 --> 02:04:32.346
I served you all blessings of world
on a gold tray.

02:04:35.913 --> 02:04:36.980
What did you do?

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:41.680
You betrayed me, Abdurrahman.

02:04:43.546 --> 02:04:46.380
To me, Noyan.

02:04:47.846 --> 02:04:52.380
Hell with you and empire of the world...

02:04:53.446 --> 02:04:54.746
...corrupt dog!

02:06:41.346 --> 02:06:42.646
I will put head of Ertugrul

02:06:43.013 --> 02:06:45.746
and this man to the entrance
of their nomad tent!
