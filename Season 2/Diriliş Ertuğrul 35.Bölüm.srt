00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 35 will start after 12:19 min.

12:19.224 --> 12:23.224
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:24.486 --> 12:28.253
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:28.598 --> 12:31.474
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.223
Thank God we united again.

12:40.257 --> 12:41.957
So my dreams were not for nothing.

12:43.723 --> 12:46.690
But you were about to see
third dream, son.

12:47.123 --> 12:48.190
You are late.

12:49.356 --> 12:51.323
I thought I would never see you again.

12:52.090 --> 12:54.090
Thanks to the one who made it happen.

12:55.090 --> 12:56.356
Thank you.

12:56.890 --> 12:59.057
If God permits.

13:01.023 --> 13:05.057
Come on. There are some people
waiting for us.

13:05.856 --> 13:07.057
Who is waiting for us?

13:07.890 --> 13:10.423
Those who will give you the package.

13:31.090 --> 13:33.390
Do you know how did
mighty army of Genghis Khan...

13:33.790 --> 13:35.790
...got this much stronger, Tangut?

13:36.157 --> 13:38.023
I want to learn about it, Baycu Noyan.

13:39.890 --> 13:41.890
By embracing Turks, too.

13:43.023 --> 13:46.423
He has always said that
you must collaborate with Turks...

13:47.157 --> 13:49.423
...if you want to take
breath fearlessly...

13:50.023 --> 13:56.790
...on mountains, moorlands, uncanny
cities, back of the beyond of universe.

13:58.390 --> 14:00.390
I once heard that your mother was Turk.

14:01.290 --> 14:02.690
You heard it right.

14:03.923 --> 14:06.190
Maybe I love Turks because of that.

14:07.090 --> 14:08.990
You may call it is because of blood.

14:10.323 --> 14:11.423
Who knows?

14:12.923 --> 14:15.990
Until the great army of Ogeday
comes, Tangut...

14:17.223 --> 14:22.723
...we will find fearless Turks
who love to die fighting.

14:23.890 --> 14:27.057
But we will irrigate this land
with their blood...

14:27.423 --> 14:30.357
...if someone from them tries to cheat.

14:32.657 --> 14:33.857
What did Efrasiyab do?

14:34.790 --> 14:36.190
He is in the heart of nomad group.

14:36.390 --> 14:38.823
He will not let it go until they
kill them.

14:39.690 --> 14:40.957
Nice.

14:46.123 --> 14:48.257
My brothers!

14:53.657 --> 14:56.790
I am glad that I share my food with you.

15:03.690 --> 15:05.190
Please be seated.

15:09.990 --> 15:12.690
Do our Alps need anything, Hamza?

15:13.257 --> 15:14.823
They need tent and bed.

15:17.790 --> 15:20.357
If one warrior, Hamza,...

15:21.057 --> 15:25.023
...does not see
sky as tent and earth as bed...

15:25.657 --> 15:27.857
...that person could not become an Alp.

15:41.923 --> 15:42.990
Serve the food.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.923
Serve the first food to Abdurrahman Alp.

16:10.823 --> 16:12.857
He is our new brother.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.757
May you live long, Efendi Noyan.

16:20.323 --> 16:22.223
Here you go, enjoy your supper.

16:36.357 --> 16:38.257
Tell us, Abdurrahman Alp.

16:39.323 --> 16:41.690
What news do you have from
the nomad group?

16:45.457 --> 16:47.790
Nomad group is like
a boiling cauldron, Bey.

16:48.890 --> 16:51.190
Every person who does not join
the mighty one will be boiled...

16:51.757 --> 16:53.023
...in that cauldron.

16:56.357 --> 16:58.990
So how did you escape
from that cauldron?

17:00.423 --> 17:03.657
I heard that they sentenced you to death.

17:07.157 --> 17:10.957
How did a big nomad group
slip you through its fingers?

17:12.157 --> 17:15.390
That man in the nomad group.
What was his name?

17:16.357 --> 17:17.357
Tugtekin.

17:18.257 --> 17:19.823
Yes, that feverish guy.

17:23.190 --> 17:25.423
How did he slip you through his fingers?

17:26.323 --> 17:28.823
Tell us so we know about your skills.

17:48.223 --> 17:52.323
Mongols bandits broke our connection
with our father's land.

17:53.257 --> 17:56.223
We are not able to do business
on our father's land.

17:57.023 --> 17:59.190
Assets' value became thousand from one.

18:00.090 --> 18:02.357
Mongols infidels will not stop.

18:02.890 --> 18:04.423
They are feeding with blood.

18:06.857 --> 18:10.123
There is nobody will stop
this Mongols cruel.

18:10.657 --> 18:14.890
That is shame that mighty people
groveled to them.

18:19.723 --> 18:24.757
If that Mongols is so mightly
how did you escape from them, Efrasiyab?

18:30.223 --> 18:34.457
They seized your properties but
why did they spare your life?

18:42.190 --> 18:47.223
I have escaped from Dodurga Alps...

18:48.657 --> 18:52.390
...just like Ertugrul escaped from yours.

18:58.257 --> 19:04.390
We, Kayi Alps, do not give up
till our last breath.

19:14.457 --> 19:20.890
If Kayis have taught you this,
why did you leave them and come to Noyan?

19:28.990 --> 19:31.123
Kayi people have forgotten their customs.

19:31.857 --> 19:35.157
Sons of Beys are drawing swords
to each other...

19:35.390 --> 19:37.790
...instead of listening problems
of the community.

19:42.723 --> 19:47.690
If there is no union
there's no life and peace.

20:02.457 --> 20:05.923
We share our purses...

20:07.990 --> 20:09.990
...as we share our food.

20:22.390 --> 20:24.957
You have earned this, Abdurrahman Alp.

22:39.223 --> 22:41.823
This Noyan will play every trick on you.

22:41.923 --> 22:46.823
Do not let that devil's sweet talk
or buy you off, Abdurrahman.

22:47.823 --> 22:49.190
Yes, Bey.

23:03.923 --> 23:05.757
Thank you, Noyan.

23:11.423 --> 23:17.757
But I have not left my nomad group
for gold or reputation.

23:21.890 --> 23:25.857
I am here because I want to be
in the future's world's state.

23:31.423 --> 23:35.090
I hope that what you said is true,
Abdurrahman Alp.

23:53.723 --> 23:56.823
Eat, Beys. Eat.

24:01.023 --> 24:04.857
Eat until you choke.

24:09.823 --> 24:14.223
Eat so you have the strength to crush
the insects which stand...

24:14.357 --> 24:15.823
...against the world's state.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.690
Eat. Eat.

24:35.173 --> 24:38.673
What on earth is this, Tugtekin Bey?
Do you want us to die?

24:38.973 --> 24:40.707
Ofcourse not. Not at all

24:41.240 --> 24:47.107
I am only curious how a merchant like you
have escaped from such wild warriors?

24:48.407 --> 24:50.807
Thanks to Ertugrul's Alps.

24:51.707 --> 24:58.707
Me and your Alps would have already
been dead if it wasn't for them.

25:06.807 --> 25:13.807
In brief, what matters is not how powerful
our enemy is, but what we do.

25:16.140 --> 25:23.140
Efrasiyab, our women weave the best rugs,
fabrics, carpets with their own hands.

25:23.340 --> 25:25.640
We have a sack full of goods.

25:25.807 --> 25:27.340
And many animals too.

25:28.073 --> 25:31.640
You go and check them all,
appraise them and after that

25:31.840 --> 25:35.373
we will make a deal.
If God permits.

25:36.707 --> 25:40.307
Okay, Bey. Give me an assistant.

25:41.640 --> 25:46.173
I came all the way here putting my head in
the lion's mouth for a successful trade.

25:46.773 --> 25:52.640
I pray to God for it will be
a profitable deal for both sides.

25:54.407 --> 25:55.840
If God permits.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.773
Alright then. You should set to work.

26:02.773 --> 26:05.707
Kocabash will accompany you, Efrasiyab.

26:22.373 --> 26:26.640
My sons. I hope we will get
what we expect.

26:27.673 --> 26:32.240
We will be ruined this winter,
if we can not succeed it again this time.

26:35.673 --> 26:37.807
Efrasiyab is a good merchant, Uncle.

26:38.006 --> 26:42.207
That's what I have heard. I hope that
we will get what we want from him, Uncle.

26:45.807 --> 26:48.607
It is your duty, Gundogdu.

26:49.307 --> 26:53.040
Our nomad group will ease for a while
with those sacs we already have.

26:53.773 --> 26:56.707
You must deal with this
without having any troubles.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.607
With great pleasure, Bey.

26:59.073 --> 27:01.940
With the help of God, I will provide
prosperity to our nomad group.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.773
I hope so. I hope so.

27:19.807 --> 27:23.140
Mongols have smashed the Islamic world.

27:23.873 --> 27:25.240
Kayi nomad group is down at the heels.

27:25.907 --> 27:29.773
You should talk about your dreams,
not your troubles, son.

27:30.140 --> 27:32.040
Dream means hope.

27:33.340 --> 27:36.707
I am speechless, and
my heart is in misery.

27:38.373 --> 27:39.940
I know that.

27:40.707 --> 27:43.607
They have invited you so you would
not be devistated any longer.

27:46.007 --> 27:49.140
Who are they? Why do they invite me?

27:49.873 --> 27:51.340
There surely must be a reason.

27:51.907 --> 27:53.873
You should be patient, son.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.873
Mother. What is going on?

28:32.607 --> 28:34.340
You are lost in thoughts again.

28:38.840 --> 28:44.007
A war breaks out inside of me
every single day, my son.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.773
I am tired of the war

28:49.040 --> 28:53.773
between Hayme the mother
and the leader of Seigniory.

28:56.040 --> 29:01.207
That unscrupulous Hayme who can't even
hold a sword herself, sent Ertugrul...

29:02.673 --> 29:04.973
...to exile. That is breaking me inside
more and more everyday.

29:06.273 --> 29:07.740
There is no such thing, Mother.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.073
Do not talk as if you do not know
Ertugrul. Do not you remember?

29:11.240 --> 29:15.273
My brother tore down those Christians
who were serving the satan.

29:16.207 --> 29:17.740
You relax.

29:19.007 --> 29:24.340
You are right, my son. You are right
but he had his mighty dad then...

29:24.773 --> 29:26.240
who was watching him out.

29:28.673 --> 29:30.673
He had you.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.307
He had his Alps.

29:36.373 --> 29:38.273
He is all alone now.

29:38.707 --> 29:40.707
What does he eat? What does he drink?

29:41.607 --> 29:43.773
Where does he sleep?

29:50.207 --> 29:53.340
Is it not too late to think about these?

30:07.107 --> 30:10.873
My daughter, Gokce. Call Halime to dinner.

30:11.407 --> 30:13.640
I have something to talk to you.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.807
Alright, Mother.

30:48.407 --> 30:50.707
Mother Hayme is calling you to dinner.

30:53.073 --> 30:54.406
I am not hungry.

30:55.607 --> 30:57.673
She has something to tell us, Halime.

30:57.906 --> 30:59.073
What is it?

31:00.906 --> 31:03.107
You will find out if you come.

32:01.140 --> 32:06.973
I have seen my son Sungurtekin near the
Caspian Sea for the last time.

32:09.807 --> 32:16.373
He reared his horse, waved me and
It was the last time I've ever seen him.

32:18.673 --> 32:21.873
He has never lost the child in him
even while he was fighting against

32:23.173 --> 32:25.907
Genghis Khan's army.

32:26.640 --> 32:32.640
There was this hopeful look in his eyes,
and he never lost his smile

32:33.273 --> 32:34.673
nor his hope in this cruel life.

32:36.773 --> 32:38.707
So does my Ertugrul.

32:39.407 --> 32:46.407
I have seen the hope and resolution in his
eyes, even when he was being exiled.

32:50.340 --> 32:53.040
They have never given up just as
their father.

32:58.140 --> 33:00.273
We will fight too.

33:02.840 --> 33:09.173
We will remember this, as long as we see
those two empty plates on our table.

33:15.307 --> 33:19.007
-In the name of Allah.
-In the name of Allah.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.273
Come on, let's eat.

33:39.340 --> 33:42.107
Today, Korkut Bey was here.

33:42.607 --> 33:45.007
He talked to me about Gokce.

33:47.740 --> 33:50.973
-I hope it is a good thing, Mother.
-It is a good thing, son.

33:52.373 --> 33:55.373
He told me that they would come
tomorrow and ask for Gokce's hand

33:55.807 --> 33:57.607
with the commandment of God.

34:52.207 --> 34:54.040
What is it, Father?

34:56.173 --> 34:58.607
It is a good thing, son.

35:02.707 --> 35:04.973
I have talked to your Aunt Hayme today.

35:06.407 --> 35:12.007
I told her that we would go and ask for
Gokce's hand for you, my son Tugtekin...

35:12.307 --> 35:14.307
...under the commandment of God
tomorrow night.

35:24.207 --> 35:26.140
It is really good news, Mother.

35:26.773 --> 35:30.073
Only a man like Tugtekin
would suit my sister Gokce.

35:36.273 --> 35:38.307
What do you think, Gokce?

35:41.773 --> 35:44.940
Would you allow me to say a few words
as her sister?

35:52.373 --> 35:53.840
Sure, my girl.

35:56.307 --> 36:02.207
Now we know why that traitor was bothering
with my sister all this time.

36:04.907 --> 36:08.073
Selcan, if you say one more word...

36:08.273 --> 36:09.707
Gundogdu.

36:11.807 --> 36:13.240
She is her sister.

36:14.140 --> 36:15.640
Let her talk.

36:15.773 --> 36:17.773
Let her say whatever she wants.

36:19.307 --> 36:23.773
She already knows that she should agree
with me in the end.

36:28.107 --> 36:33.640
Her Bey's marquee is not enough for her.
She wants to rule her step child's bed.

36:35.140 --> 36:39.673
She took my husband first,
now my sister...

36:41.173 --> 36:45.840
I do not even count Alps that she captured
and Ertugrul that she sent away

36:46.140 --> 36:47.607
from the nomad group.

36:52.040 --> 36:55.607
That woman would not be satisfied
even with Kayi's marquee.

36:57.940 --> 37:02.107
Now she wants to twist my poor sister
around her finger.

37:02.207 --> 37:03.807
That's enough.

37:04.740 --> 37:06.607
Enough, sister, what the hell
are you talking about?

37:06.807 --> 37:10.307
Selcan, how can you talk like that?

37:10.607 --> 37:12.273
Have you lost your mind?

37:13.840 --> 37:17.973
You must get those sick thoughts out of
your mind, sister.

37:18.273 --> 37:20.273
Swallow your words, then come here
and talk to us.

37:20.673 --> 37:23.873
I am not the only one that you are
humiliating this way.

37:24.640 --> 37:26.907
You are also humiliating yourself
and our family.

37:28.140 --> 37:31.940
Do I look like I care about humiliating
myself from now on, Gokce?

37:33.673 --> 37:37.773
If I have the right to say
only one word as your sister

37:38.173 --> 37:42.407
you should know that
I will not give my blessings to you

37:43.140 --> 37:44.807
if you get married
to that arrogant bastard.

37:45.007 --> 37:46.007
Selcan!

37:50.407 --> 37:52.040
Enough already.

37:56.273 --> 38:00.607
You keep harping on Aytolun
since we came here.

38:02.240 --> 38:06.007
You have been denigrating
my big brother and niece all the time.

38:06.307 --> 38:09.140
I did not say a word until now
but that is enough.

38:09.307 --> 38:11.807
You started talking against my marquee.

38:12.673 --> 38:14.307
You must know your place.

38:16.273 --> 38:18.740
You pull yourself together or...

38:18.873 --> 38:20.373
Or what, Mother?

38:22.207 --> 38:24.607
Will you send me into exile like Ertugrul?

38:29.040 --> 38:34.340
All truth is not always to be told, right?
Will I be banished just because...

38:38.607 --> 38:41.940
...I am telling the truth?
All I have left are my words.

38:43.307 --> 38:47.373
I call you mother, because you are
my mother.

38:48.607 --> 38:52.173
You did a lot for me even if you did
not give birth to me.

38:54.007 --> 38:57.140
Whatever you decision will be, I should
submit it.

38:57.740 --> 39:01.973
But these are my thoughts, Mother.

39:07.740 --> 39:09.340
Have a good night.

39:24.340 --> 39:26.240
Excuse me.

39:32.007 --> 39:33.273
Excuse me, Mother.

39:49.940 --> 39:52.673
We should not go there empty handed,
Aytolun Hatun.

39:52.973 --> 39:54.807
Make a good preparation.

39:54.973 --> 39:56.940
Ofcourse, Bey.

39:57.607 --> 39:59.840
Especially for such a blessed night.

40:01.940 --> 40:03.940
Isn't that so, Tugtekin?

40:05.707 --> 40:07.173
You are right, Mother.

40:09.107 --> 40:12.073
You did not say anything
about my decision, my son.

40:12.273 --> 40:14.840
I will do whatever you approve, Father.

40:15.140 --> 40:19.407
It is like the sun has risen on his
shadowed face, Bey. Don't you see it?

40:20.707 --> 40:24.273
He cannot show his delight
due to his respect to you.

40:25.073 --> 40:26.740
Isn't it right, Tugtekin?

40:27.673 --> 40:29.273
That is correct, Mother.

40:31.640 --> 40:35.040
Selcan probably had gone mad
when she heard about it.

40:36.240 --> 40:39.207
What is that woman's problem with you?

40:40.073 --> 40:44.340
She is a sorrowful woman whose babies died
one after another, Bey.

40:45.307 --> 40:52.173
Poor woman. I feel pity for her
even if I get angry with her sometimes.

40:52.707 --> 40:54.673
I feel pity for Gundogdu mostly.

40:54.940 --> 40:57.773
He is wasting that poor man's life
too as he did to himself.

40:58.007 --> 41:02.840
I hope that Gundogdu Bey would come to
his senses and find a decent woman...

41:03.007 --> 41:06.840
...that suits himself and have a child
before he gets too old.

41:07.173 --> 41:09.340
I can not allow this any longer, Mother.

41:09.807 --> 41:13.140
I can not allow Selcan to consume both
my life and kin.

41:13.307 --> 41:18.740
Son. Starting a family is tough,
but breaking it up is very easy.

41:19.840 --> 41:23.840
You should not be the one to brake it up.
Do not make the angels in the sky cry.

41:24.007 --> 41:28.640
No, Mother. Either I will kill her
or she will kill me.

41:28.907 --> 41:30.873
This relationship will not end well.

41:32.140 --> 41:34.140
I will not eat anything.
I do not feel like it.

42:01.773 --> 42:04.940
I want you to know that I have loved you
since I was a child.

42:05.173 --> 42:07.173
I have loved you ever since I could
remember, Ertugrul.

42:07.407 --> 42:11.973
I will not let Halime or anyone else to
take this beautiful pain away from me.

42:12.207 --> 42:14.340
I will wait for you until I die
if necessary.

42:14.807 --> 42:16.073
<i>What do you think you are doing, Gokce?</i>

42:16.340 --> 42:18.407
How can I endure seeing you
in the same marquee

42:18.840 --> 42:20.673
with my wife and children?
How can I look at their faces?

42:20.907 --> 42:23.107
<i>How can I carry you like</i>
 <i>a ruthless guilty conscience?</i>

42:36.073 --> 42:37.807
Ertugrul.

42:42.340 --> 42:44.173
Why that woman?

42:47.073 --> 42:49.073
Why is it not me, but her?

42:49.973 --> 42:51.373
Why?

43:02.673 --> 43:04.373
You, night people.

43:06.607 --> 43:11.073
Thank God who created the night and
the day for us.

43:13.340 --> 43:16.173
He is the one
who gives strength after weakness.

43:17.373 --> 43:23.373
There are easiness and conquests
after every difficulty and grueling.

43:24.273 --> 43:25.940
Who are the ones to conquer?

43:26.673 --> 43:29.107
Brave ones. Alp ones.

43:29.707 --> 43:31.307
Alperen ones.

43:33.340 --> 43:36.307
Bravery is the state of power
and strength.

43:37.140 --> 43:40.207
So how can one reach the state
of bravery?

43:41.107 --> 43:43.140
By controlling his anger.

43:43.840 --> 43:46.107
By respecting his elders.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.407
By showing mercy to underdogs.

43:48.907 --> 43:53.140
By rebelling against cruelty
and serving his people.

43:57.340 --> 43:59.840
Muhammad commands that

44:00.040 --> 44:03.907
who can be the servent of his people
is the Master of them.

44:05.940 --> 44:10.007
The one who thinks of serving as the main
duty of a Master, is the real brave one.

44:10.407 --> 44:13.140
That one is Alp. That one is Alperen.

44:15.307 --> 44:17.973
Listen, night people.

44:18.640 --> 44:21.973
It is time for the son of Suleyman Shah,
the brave of Alps, Ertugrul,

44:22.140 --> 44:26.340
who has devoted himself to serve
for The Turkish islamic guild,

44:27.073 --> 44:29.807
to put on his holy dress.

44:31.607 --> 44:34.273
He is now a member of the Turkish
islamic guild.

44:34.707 --> 44:37.807
He is the valiant of young men.

44:45.307 --> 44:48.640
<i>Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar.</i>

44:48.807 --> 44:52.940
<i>La ilahe illallahu vallahu akbar.</i>

44:53.107 --> 44:56.307
<i>Allahu akbar and lillahi'l-hamd.</i>

44:56.607 --> 44:59.840
<i>Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar.</i>

44:59.973 --> 45:04.140
<i>La ilahe illallahu vallahu akbar.</i>

45:04.273 --> 45:07.673
<i>Allahu akbar and lillahi'l-hamd.</i>

45:07.807 --> 45:11.207
<i>Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar.</i>

45:11.307 --> 45:15.373
<i>La ilahe illallahu vallahu akbar.</i>

45:15.673 --> 45:18.907
<i>Allahu akbar and lillahi'l-hamd.</i>

45:19.173 --> 45:22.707
<i>Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar.</i>

45:22.907 --> 45:26.973
<i>La ilahe illallahu vallahu akbar.</i>

45:27.173 --> 45:30.407
<i>Allahu akbar and lillahi'l-hamd.</i>

45:30.740 --> 45:33.940
<i>Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar.</i>

45:34.207 --> 45:38.207
<i>La ilahe illallahu vallahu ekber.</i>

45:38.673 --> 45:42.140
<i>Allahu akbar and lillahi'l-hamd.</i>

48:00.107 --> 48:02.807
<i>Illallah.</i>

48:18.940 --> 48:22.773
Holly Lord who has eternal vitality
and aliveness.

48:23.640 --> 48:29.807
Oh God though who makes existence exists
with his entity.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.640
My God who owns everything.

48:33.407 --> 48:36.840
We are being protected by you.
Please protect us.

48:37.807 --> 48:43.007
Please offer this to us with the shield
of Your name, with verity

48:43.107 --> 48:47.040
with protection, with order.

48:47.207 --> 48:50.240
-Amen.
-Amen.

48:58.340 --> 49:02.940
Let my desire not humiliate me on this
holly path.

49:05.140 --> 49:07.707
I will always rebel against cruelty.

49:09.673 --> 49:14.040
I will always use my weapon
according to the scales of justice.

49:15.973 --> 49:19.307
I will always serve my people.

49:20.707 --> 49:24.173
I will always fight for world's order.

49:26.207 --> 49:32.273
Son, do not take off this shirt
in the great wars you will fight.

49:34.907 --> 49:37.807
Do not forget. This is the exposed one.

49:38.207 --> 49:41.273
What you really wear is in your heart.

49:43.907 --> 49:47.940
May God not embarrass me for the sake of
my fight.

49:49.707 --> 49:51.240
-Amen.
-Amen.

50:29.907 --> 50:31.107
Gokce.

50:31.707 --> 50:33.040
Yes, Mother?

50:34.340 --> 50:37.140
We could not talk to you
throughly last night.

50:37.907 --> 50:40.073
What do you think
about your uncle's offer?

50:49.207 --> 50:53.373
Mother Hayme, as you would appreciate,
it is so sudden.

50:55.273 --> 50:58.640
I do not know what to say while
Gundogdu and my sister are on bad terms.

51:00.940 --> 51:02.840
Let us hope for the best.

51:04.673 --> 51:08.173
And you are the one to make this
blessed decision.

51:11.407 --> 51:17.607
However, I am curious about
Ertugrul's opinion on this matter.

51:22.007 --> 51:26.740
I now want to prepare this place
for tonight's guests as worthy of you.

51:31.007 --> 51:32.673
Excuse me.

51:36.373 --> 51:39.240
Fine, girl. That will be good.

51:40.640 --> 51:42.307
May it be easy.

51:53.107 --> 51:56.873
Very well.
Did you also see cattles and sheeps?

51:57.107 --> 51:59.607
Artuk Bey and I checked them all
one by one, Bey.

52:06.407 --> 52:10.740
Our animals are fattened, Bey. They are
in good comdition.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.073
-They do not have any sickness.
-That is wonderful!

52:37.007 --> 52:38.673
Gundogdu?

52:41.307 --> 52:43.207
I hope nothing is wrong.

52:44.173 --> 52:45.840
Where is this man?

52:48.207 --> 52:50.673
How could not I wake up?

53:25.607 --> 53:29.773
Efrasiyab, I swear to God
you cannot find such good animals...

53:30.073 --> 53:32.107
...in any Turkish nomad group.
They have plenty of meat.

53:32.340 --> 53:33.707
They have plenty of wool.

53:35.673 --> 53:38.807
-May it be easy, Gundogdu Bey.
-Thank you, Aytolun Hatun.

53:43.073 --> 53:44.673
So, merchant?

53:45.273 --> 53:48.340
I hope you will not be stingy
and leave us in the lurch.

53:48.773 --> 53:51.407
I am generous, Hanim. Do not be afraid.

53:56.373 --> 54:00.940
Even if you are a penny pincher,
our great Gundogdu Bey will probably

54:01.173 --> 54:03.840
make you loosen your purse strings.

54:04.673 --> 54:06.673
No, Aytolun Hatun. Wait.

54:06.873 --> 54:10.040
We have not done a bargain yet.
He will check on the rugs.

54:10.407 --> 54:13.340
He will check on the carpets.
Then we will start the bargain.

54:24.707 --> 54:25.940
What is going on, Selcan?

54:27.073 --> 54:29.640
I was worried when I could not see you,
Bey.

54:31.040 --> 54:33.007
Why would you be worried, Selcan?

54:33.173 --> 54:35.007
Here is a huge nomad group, what could
happen to me?

54:35.307 --> 54:38.307
Everything bad that happened to us has
happened in this big nomad group, right?

54:38.773 --> 54:42.007
That is why I get worried every time
I do not see you.

54:48.173 --> 54:49.807
Excuse us, Bey.

54:50.073 --> 54:51.273
Let us leave.

54:59.340 --> 55:02.607
Tell us, Selcan Hatun.
What did this big nomad group do to you

55:02.807 --> 55:05.907
other than welcoming you to
it's dinner table?

55:07.007 --> 55:11.640
I should know this as The Hatun,
so I will fix our flaws.

55:15.240 --> 55:18.173
Do you know what is
the greatest flaw, Aytolun?

55:18.973 --> 55:21.973
Your desire to rule everything
as being The Hatun.

55:22.173 --> 55:24.607
Shush! Selcan!

55:26.373 --> 55:28.873
It is no problem. It is not important.

55:29.207 --> 55:33.140
It seems that Selcan Hatun
is trying to be a mischief maker

55:33.340 --> 55:36.173
which she could not succeed
in Kayi nomad group.

55:36.607 --> 55:41.740
But this paradise cannot be
the playground of her demons.

55:42.073 --> 55:45.407
Neither Bey nor I would allow it.

55:46.640 --> 55:47.807
Loot at her!

55:48.073 --> 55:51.973
Demons became angels
but we were unaware of that.

55:53.907 --> 55:56.907
What were those demons doing
while you were breaking up families

55:57.273 --> 55:59.307
and taking place in marquees?

56:00.073 --> 56:01.407
Selcan!

56:02.007 --> 56:05.340
Go back to your tent now!
I will really cause an accident.

56:05.740 --> 56:06.973
Come on.

56:10.773 --> 56:12.173
Come on.

56:18.240 --> 56:22.207
I will prepare your morning food, Bey.
You come and eat.

56:31.907 --> 56:33.707
My apologies, Aytolun Hatun.

56:35.773 --> 56:38.007
It is no problem, Gundogdu Bey.

56:40.173 --> 56:44.773
Wonderful. You are really patient, Bey.

56:47.306 --> 56:54.306
You were patient with this barren, wild,
impertinent woman for all these years.

56:55.940 --> 56:59.007
I wanted to say thisfor so long
but kept my mouth shut.

57:00.707 --> 57:03.973
There is no mor Ertugrul nor Sungurtekin.

57:04.806 --> 57:07.107
Suleyman Shah's lineage is
about to become extinct.

57:07.773 --> 57:13.107
If you wait for this devilish woman,
you will wait for a long time, Bey.

57:14.107 --> 57:16.373
Kayi would break up.

57:18.840 --> 57:20.307
You mark my words.

57:20.740 --> 57:22.073
May it be easy.

57:51.340 --> 57:53.407
You are devil. Devil!

57:54.640 --> 57:57.140
You subverted the peace in nomad group.

57:57.773 --> 57:59.773
I am at the end of my tether
because of you.

57:59.940 --> 58:01.607
Are you talking to me, Gundogdu?

58:02.040 --> 58:05.273
Do you not see the evil next to you
and find fault in me?

58:05.773 --> 58:08.807
Shut the hell up!

58:17.607 --> 58:19.373
God damn the day I have met you, woman.

58:19.973 --> 58:22.840
God damn the day
I have taken you into my tent.

58:23.007 --> 58:24.673
It is not bearable any more.

58:24.907 --> 58:27.073
I do not want to see your face again.

58:27.673 --> 58:31.973
Pack your things and get out of my tent.
Okay? Get out!

58:33.307 --> 58:35.073
I will not go. I will not go.

58:35.173 --> 58:37.840
I will not leave my home
to that devilish woman.

58:38.073 --> 58:39.640
I will not give my home to her.

58:39.873 --> 58:40.973
Woman!

58:41.907 --> 58:44.840
Is there any home left, woman?
Is there any home left?

58:45.040 --> 58:46.040
Is there any peace left?

58:46.273 --> 58:49.273
Get out! Get out, I do not want to see
your face again. Get out of my tent.

58:49.740 --> 58:51.407
-I will not go. I will not leave you.
-Go. Get out. Come on.

58:51.807 --> 58:53.707
-No, I will not go.
-Get out.

58:53.940 --> 58:56.207
You are not my woman anymore.
Get out!

58:57.607 --> 59:00.173
Get out! Go! Go!

59:00.340 --> 59:02.173
Get out!

59:07.940 --> 59:09.240
My God!

59:19.407 --> 59:21.740
The circumstances in the nomad group is
really tough.

59:22.007 --> 59:25.007
Do not give them the amount
they are asking for.

59:26.273 --> 59:27.940
You are their last hope.

59:30.040 --> 59:31.907
Aytolun is so tough.

59:32.407 --> 59:34.640
Gundogdu is so smart.

59:35.840 --> 59:38.240
Gundogdu has problems with his woman.

59:39.640 --> 59:44.373
You should entrap them slowly.

59:47.307 --> 59:50.307
We will take action as soon as we hear
from Noyan.

59:51.640 --> 59:57.007
Let us see how the nomad tent
will survive the winter without any gold.

01:00:03.707 --> 01:00:05.040
Good boy.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.040
Come on.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:11.040
Good boy.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.640
Harder.

01:00:17.773 --> 01:00:19.940
I would be scared if I were
your enemy, son.

01:00:21.707 --> 01:00:24.707
Your sword turns into the angel of death
in your hands. Wonderful.

01:00:25.107 --> 01:00:27.607
My brother mows infidels
like he mows grass.

01:00:29.407 --> 01:00:30.407
Stop.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.007
Turali.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.040
When you hold your weapon,
you will not feel the difference

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.240
between your hand
and your weapon. Okay?

01:00:42.073 --> 01:00:43.073
Hold it now.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.707
I want an axe as well, Turgut Alp.
I will not fight without an axe.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.040
Let us hope for that. Maybe some day.

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:54.873
You will ask it from the master,
not from me, son.

01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:00.807
Brother. What will we do
about this traitor in the nomad group?

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.973
We will follow every trace.

01:01:04.107 --> 01:01:05.940
The traitor will surely leave a trace.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.140
Peace be upon you.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:18.373
-And peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:01:18.673 --> 01:01:22.707
We owe you our lives. We want to have a
dinner and have fun with you sometime.

01:01:23.073 --> 01:01:28.173
Dinner is fine but we are not
in the mood of fun, merchant.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.940
You would be out of your spirits
if you commiserate.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.907
We owe you our lives, brother.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.907
Your sorrow is our sorrow from now on.

01:01:41.973 --> 01:01:45.240
We know how to share your pain
as we share our bread.

01:01:49.007 --> 01:01:51.740
Thank you, Kocabash. Thank you.

01:01:52.107 --> 01:01:53.707
Thank you.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.207
Excuse us. You know, we have a lot to do.

01:02:01.407 --> 01:02:02.907
May it be easy.

01:02:13.773 --> 01:02:17.007
We cannot win victory
even if we make the all nomad group

01:02:17.207 --> 01:02:21.807
go down on their knees as long
as Ertugrul and his Alps do not give up.

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:28.073
I would not die in disappointment since I
saw this Kocabash mutt...

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:32.173
...turned into a sheep. They learned
to appreciate.

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:36.007
A fox cannot be your friend
as you cannot use a bear's peltry.

01:02:37.107 --> 01:02:39.207
Once a whore, always a whore.

01:02:39.373 --> 01:02:41.207
You should be careful.

01:03:08.907 --> 01:03:10.240
Selcan?

01:03:11.207 --> 01:03:12.640
My girl.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.207
What happened?

01:03:15.773 --> 01:03:17.107
Come here.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:21.873
Come here, girl. Come here. Sit down.

01:03:22.007 --> 01:03:23.007
Selcan.

01:03:25.073 --> 01:03:27.840
What happened to you? Tell us.

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.140
It is over, Mother.

01:03:34.807 --> 01:03:36.807
Everything is over.

01:03:37.073 --> 01:03:39.607
We are at the point of no return.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.107
What do you mean
everything is over, Selcan?

01:03:42.407 --> 01:03:43.907
What do you mean by
the point of no return?

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:52.640
Gundogdu does not want me
neither in his bed

01:03:53.307 --> 01:03:54.640
nor in his tent.

01:03:55.673 --> 01:03:57.173
Bring water.

01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:02.640
He does not want me in front of his eyes
or on the land he steps on.

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:06.273
I have no place to stay
in this nomad tent anymore.

01:04:07.673 --> 01:04:09.107
Selcan.

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.773
My girl. Selcan.

01:04:19.373 --> 01:04:23.373
You are not only a daughter-in-law to me,
but also a daughter.

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.140
Do not say that again.

01:04:26.673 --> 01:04:30.940
There is a solution for everything
in this world except for death.

01:04:32.307 --> 01:04:35.173
You can stay with Halime for a while.

01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:39.773
You will be companions.

01:04:42.607 --> 01:04:45.207
Sit and relax. Pull yourself together.

01:04:46.073 --> 01:04:48.240
After that we will talk.

01:04:52.707 --> 01:04:54.040
Okay, my girl?

01:04:56.073 --> 01:04:57.873
-Selcan.
-Selcan.

01:04:59.373 --> 01:05:03.040
Aytolun and Gokce were
the final straw, right?

01:05:13.321 --> 01:05:15.587
Elhamdulillah, thanks to the One
who feed us.

01:05:16.821 --> 01:05:18.121
Thanks to God.

01:05:18.487 --> 01:05:19.754
Excuse me, sir.

01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:28.921
Your heart seems broken.

01:05:30.721 --> 01:05:32.421
Why are you sad?

01:05:35.187 --> 01:05:36.354
Nobody understands me.

01:05:37.854 --> 01:05:39.787
They do not listen even
if I warn them for trouble.

01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:43.887
They made me fell apart.

01:05:46.154 --> 01:05:50.487
Son, your best friend during your
bravery journey is your loneliness.

01:05:52.121 --> 01:05:53.854
Do not wait them to understand you.

01:05:54.721 --> 01:05:58.521
Your mother, your wife,
your brother and your Alps.

01:05:59.187 --> 01:06:00.787
None of them will understand you.

01:06:02.587 --> 01:06:04.521
They will not see the horizon inside you.

01:06:06.121 --> 01:06:11.287
Bravery is equal to make everyone
a partner to your dreams.

01:06:12.154 --> 01:06:17.687
Bravery is telling your dream
to your people.

01:06:18.921 --> 01:06:20.821
Do not ever feel hopelessness.

01:06:21.921 --> 01:06:25.787
Because when you keep
the justice flag flying...

01:06:27.554 --> 01:06:30.354
...72 nations must find a place
under its shadow.

01:06:32.821 --> 01:06:34.554
There is always enemy.

01:06:35.587 --> 01:06:38.454
Oghuz Tribes and Islam World
could not take a breath.

01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:41.621
Son, you should be happy about it.

01:06:42.587 --> 01:06:45.387
Because when they are no longer
enemy of yours

01:06:45.621 --> 01:06:48.321
it means that your presence
is no longer valuable.

01:06:50.321 --> 01:06:53.621
It means you have already lost
your high value.

01:06:54.854 --> 01:06:58.454
Because they declare war against
your beliefs.

01:07:02.354 --> 01:07:03.521
Thank you.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.521
My heart is healed.

01:07:08.454 --> 01:07:09.854
When will I see you again?

01:07:10.887 --> 01:07:15.287
We will be together for a long time
after a short period of separation.

01:07:22.187 --> 01:07:24.421
Do not show the belt
you dressed to anyone.

01:07:25.487 --> 01:07:28.721
It could be affected by the evil eye.
Do not forget it.

01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:31.521
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:38.754
See you in a short while.

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:40.554
If God permits.

01:07:49.354 --> 01:07:51.654
Tell me, Karabey.
What is this important issue?

01:07:53.387 --> 01:07:55.187
Saadettin Kobek sends his regards.

01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:59.721
Sultan Aladdin sent a spy
named Ertokus to that area.

01:08:01.121 --> 01:08:03.754
He is collecting information
for the campaign he will launch

01:08:03.887 --> 01:08:05.254
against you in spring.

01:08:05.587 --> 01:08:09.121
So Sultan Aladdin still thinks that
he can get rid of us.

01:08:10.354 --> 01:08:12.754
So he still wants to play with us.

01:08:14.487 --> 01:08:16.821
Fine. Let it be.

01:08:19.187 --> 01:08:20.454
Tangut. Hamza.

01:08:21.921 --> 01:08:24.754
Give my respect to Saadettin Kobek
for this information.

01:08:25.654 --> 01:08:26.887
Yes, sir.

01:08:27.187 --> 01:08:29.187
Hamza, you will go for hunt.

01:08:29.854 --> 01:08:32.554
A traitor named Ertokus.
He will not be dead.

01:08:33.121 --> 01:08:34.921
I want him alive. Do you understand?

01:08:36.587 --> 01:08:37.854
With great pleasure.

01:08:38.287 --> 01:08:41.687
By the way,
take Abdurrahman Alp with you.

01:08:42.654 --> 01:08:46.554
But if he betrays, you are responsible.

01:08:46.754 --> 01:08:48.254
You do not worry, Noyan.

01:09:12.454 --> 01:09:15.121
Son, do you have time?

01:09:17.721 --> 01:09:18.854
Yes, mother.

01:09:21.387 --> 01:09:24.354
Gumustekin sent his Alp. They will
stay there longer than expected.

01:09:24.787 --> 01:09:27.854
He wanted you to send your Alps
to take Goncagul from caravansary.

01:09:28.287 --> 01:09:30.187
You know, roads are too dangerous.

01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:32.387
I will take my sister Goncagul, Mother.

01:09:32.654 --> 01:09:36.387
You know, she is my brother's
dearest daughter. He loves her a lot.

01:09:37.154 --> 01:09:40.221
Of course, Mother.
That is why I said I will take her.

01:09:41.587 --> 01:09:42.921
We will be back till the end of the day.

01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.754
You be back so we will ask Gokce for you.

01:09:47.354 --> 01:09:49.854
Goncagul is at the age
of marriage, as well.

01:09:50.254 --> 01:09:52.321
She should experience this excitement.

01:09:53.154 --> 01:09:55.521
She may get married soon, too.

01:10:09.454 --> 01:10:12.221
My daughter! My beautiful girl.

01:10:13.254 --> 01:10:14.521
My sheep.

01:10:17.354 --> 01:10:21.121
Do not say anything anymore to
marriage between Tugtekin and Gokce.

01:10:22.254 --> 01:10:23.487
What can we do?

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:26.787
We just hope for the best.

01:10:30.121 --> 01:10:31.587
Come on, my girl. Come on.

01:10:32.221 --> 01:10:33.287
-Come on, Selcan.
-Come on.

01:11:13.787 --> 01:11:15.321
Everything will be fine.

01:11:19.521 --> 01:11:22.454
We will get through
these tough days together, Selcan.

01:11:25.787 --> 01:11:31.254
I will suffer the pain one by one
for evil things I did to you...

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:36.454
...and Ertugrul Bey, my Gundogdu.

01:11:39.254 --> 01:11:40.421
I know that.

01:11:46.887 --> 01:11:49.121
What comes around goes around, Halime.

01:11:51.154 --> 01:11:54.154
I will not escape just by burning in hell.

01:11:58.887 --> 01:12:00.187
Halime.

01:12:03.187 --> 01:12:04.487
I will shut my mouth.

01:12:06.187 --> 01:12:08.154
Do you know why will I do that?

01:12:11.154 --> 01:12:15.887
So my sister forgets about Ertugrul.

01:12:19.287 --> 01:12:23.221
Do you think that I do not see
the torture she did to you?

01:12:26.487 --> 01:12:28.154
I will shut my mouth...

01:12:29.287 --> 01:12:35.187
...but we all will see the consequences
of this marriage by living it.

01:12:58.621 --> 01:13:00.121
Bey, I should come with you.

01:13:00.454 --> 01:13:01.721
You do not worry.

01:13:03.521 --> 01:13:05.154
We will be back before night.

01:13:06.921 --> 01:13:09.187
You keep an eye on
this merchant Efrasiyab.

01:13:10.154 --> 01:13:12.321
Why, Bey? Did he do something wrong?

01:13:12.854 --> 01:13:14.721
I only trust my weapon
while Noyan's breath

01:13:14.921 --> 01:13:16.887
is just behind our neck, Kocabash.

01:13:19.387 --> 01:13:21.787
You are right, Bey. You are right.

01:13:27.721 --> 01:13:28.721
Gokce.

01:13:47.121 --> 01:13:48.587
It seems that Aunt Hayme
have talked with you.

01:13:51.154 --> 01:13:52.887
She has told me what Korkut Bey told, Bey.

01:13:55.754 --> 01:13:57.287
That is why you are not
trying to look at me?

01:14:00.421 --> 01:14:03.454
As you can imagine,
since things are like that.

01:14:07.321 --> 01:14:08.621
I will go to take Goncagul.

01:14:10.187 --> 01:14:13.121
If it is in our kismet,
we will come to your tent tonight.

01:14:14.187 --> 01:14:15.354
I know that.

01:14:16.221 --> 01:14:17.654
My way is not so long.

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:22.587
But you should know that my heart
is beating like hell, Gokce.

01:14:30.187 --> 01:14:31.721
I would have wanted
what you are going to say.

01:14:34.187 --> 01:14:36.421
I am afraid that I feel one-day long road
as one century, Gokce.

01:14:40.254 --> 01:14:43.521
It is Mother Hayme and
Korkut Bey's decision, Bey.

01:14:47.387 --> 01:14:48.387
You are right.

01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:55.521
But what your heart thinks
is more important than their decision.

01:15:00.154 --> 01:15:01.654
Let us hope best for us.

01:16:20.187 --> 01:16:21.287
Yes, Halime Sultan?

01:16:29.787 --> 01:16:31.254
Where is Ertugrul Bey?

01:16:39.554 --> 01:16:40.654
I want to talk to him.

01:16:42.154 --> 01:16:44.554
I know that he is in an awkward position
but I must talk to him.

01:16:57.321 --> 01:17:01.587
Our Bey will absolutely find a way to see
you once he is back, Halime Sultan.

01:17:01.821 --> 01:17:03.287
Do not you know that?

01:17:04.354 --> 01:17:08.187
I know that but it is hard for him
to come back to nomad group.

01:17:09.587 --> 01:17:11.821
His mother has exiled him.
You also know that.

01:17:14.321 --> 01:17:17.354
I cannot wait without doing anything.

01:17:19.254 --> 01:17:22.387
Tell me if you know where he is.
I will go there to see him.

01:17:24.221 --> 01:17:25.887
It is not right for you
to leave nomad group

01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:28.154
while Mongols are nearby, sister Halime.

01:17:31.887 --> 01:17:33.654
And we do not know where he is,
right, brother?

01:17:34.787 --> 01:17:36.221
Yes, we do not know it.

01:17:40.721 --> 01:17:42.621
I will not give my blessing to you

01:17:44.221 --> 01:17:45.654
if you know it but do not tell me.

01:17:49.721 --> 01:17:51.554
I beg you do not talk
like that, Halime Sultan.

01:17:52.721 --> 01:17:55.621
We are servants who have committed
our life and spirit to our Bey.

01:17:57.521 --> 01:17:59.287
There is no difference between you
and our Bey, sister Halime.

01:17:59.421 --> 01:18:00.887
We just do not know it.

01:18:16.354 --> 01:18:19.154
Brother Turgut.
Mother Hayme, Halime Sultan.

01:18:19.421 --> 01:18:20.921
I have not lied that much all my life.

01:18:22.554 --> 01:18:24.187
I wish I knew what to do.

01:18:26.554 --> 01:18:27.587
Let us go.

01:19:41.321 --> 01:19:42.554
Goncagul Hatun.

01:19:49.187 --> 01:19:50.221
Atabey Ertokus.

01:19:50.921 --> 01:19:52.887
Come please. Give me company.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.187
Why did you come here?

01:20:04.587 --> 01:20:06.587
I am visiting my aunt Aytolun.

01:20:07.421 --> 01:20:11.187
It must be an important matter
since your father has sent you alone.

01:20:11.921 --> 01:20:13.687
Yes, it is an important matter.

01:20:14.554 --> 01:20:18.254
He has sent me since he had
some work to do in Konya.

01:20:19.654 --> 01:20:23.654
What about you?
How come did Sultan Aladdin let you go?

01:20:24.687 --> 01:20:28.254
I know that he does not go anywhere
in palace without you.

01:20:29.387 --> 01:20:30.921
Let us say it is an important duty.

01:20:33.354 --> 01:20:35.354
Innkeeper.
-Yes, Bey?

01:20:35.654 --> 01:20:37.854
-Set the table.
-Yes, efendi.

01:20:50.287 --> 01:20:53.187
Sister Halime is following us, brother.
It is not a good sign.

01:20:53.554 --> 01:20:55.121
Our Bey will be mad at us.

01:20:55.554 --> 01:20:57.754
Only mad? He will kick our ass.

01:20:58.221 --> 01:21:00.187
-So what will we do?
-Nothing to do.

01:21:00.321 --> 01:21:01.854
We will say that she followed us.

01:21:02.487 --> 01:21:04.687
So we will lie as if our Bey
would believe it.

01:21:06.554 --> 01:21:10.921
If lovers are going to be united
then they can call us liers.

01:22:00.487 --> 01:22:01.854
Those old times, Hamza.

01:22:03.121 --> 01:22:06.187
Once we were looking for
Ertugrul Bey here.

01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:15.187
Those times have passed.

01:22:17.854 --> 01:22:19.754
We have given our lives for them.

01:22:21.421 --> 01:22:24.854
But they stroke at our hearts.
They have fired us from our homes.

01:22:28.521 --> 01:22:30.554
Now forget about Ertugrul
so we do our duty.

01:22:33.787 --> 01:22:35.254
Keep your eyes open.

01:22:35.554 --> 01:22:38.321
Learn who is Atabey Ertokus
and where to find him.

01:23:11.254 --> 01:23:15.354
Is The Great Seljuk Empire sleeping
while Mongols are walking around?

01:23:16.921 --> 01:23:19.187
Sultan Aladdin must know something.

01:23:21.487 --> 01:23:24.554
It is really shame if our destiny is
in the hand of Sultan who is in palace.

01:23:28.254 --> 01:23:30.721
Does Sultan leave palace and join war?

01:23:32.521 --> 01:23:34.454
Do you learn these words
from your father, girl?

01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:39.387
The one who looks at palace
sees the boiling cauldron

01:23:39.587 --> 01:23:41.321
inside of it, Ertokus Bey.

01:23:48.321 --> 01:23:50.654
So your eyes can see behind the walls?

01:23:52.354 --> 01:23:54.454
I wish you could have seen
your father's passion.

01:23:57.921 --> 01:24:00.154
Innkeeper, set the table quickly.

01:24:05.554 --> 01:24:06.821
Noyan trusts in you a lot.

01:24:07.921 --> 01:24:09.387
I also trust in him.

01:24:12.387 --> 01:24:14.287
You will also notice
quintessence inside him soon.

01:24:37.821 --> 01:24:38.921
Tell everyone to be ready.

01:25:12.854 --> 01:25:14.254
Lunatic, get out.

01:25:32.487 --> 01:25:33.554
I said get out.

01:26:08.387 --> 01:26:09.387
What is going on?

01:26:29.354 --> 01:26:30.887
No! No!

01:26:31.721 --> 01:26:33.854
Leave me alone! I said leave me alone!

01:26:35.287 --> 01:26:36.287
No!

01:26:40.421 --> 01:26:42.254
Are you the dog of Sultan Aladdin?

01:26:42.554 --> 01:26:44.387
Ask permission, damned!

01:26:46.121 --> 01:26:48.754
-Take this woman. Tie them all.
-No! No!

01:26:50.321 --> 01:26:51.754
Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

01:26:52.121 --> 01:26:55.287
You will pay for it! Who are you? Who?

01:27:24.754 --> 01:27:26.754
-Bey.
-Brother Turgut.

01:27:27.254 --> 01:27:28.787
-Welcome, Bey.
-Greetings, brother.

01:27:31.721 --> 01:27:32.721
Dogan.

01:27:34.387 --> 01:27:35.821
-Welcome, Bey.
-Greetings.

01:27:50.187 --> 01:27:51.821
Abdurrahman is in the nest of snake.

01:27:52.421 --> 01:27:54.821
I hope he will be our eye in the back.

01:27:55.654 --> 01:27:58.754
But we do not know
if he is alive or dead, Bey.

01:27:59.787 --> 01:28:01.621
What if he could not have gain
Noyan's trust?

01:28:01.887 --> 01:28:03.587
What if something happen?

01:28:04.287 --> 01:28:06.287
There is only one way to find out.

01:28:06.754 --> 01:28:08.454
Entering the snake's nest.

01:28:09.454 --> 01:28:10.821
That's what I am going to do.

01:28:11.154 --> 01:28:13.654
Then we must go right away, Bey.

01:28:15.554 --> 01:28:17.187
Not now, brother Turgut.

01:28:17.387 --> 01:28:21.487
We have to know every weak points
of him in order to attack Noyan.

01:28:25.921 --> 01:28:27.921
We do not have our nomad group's
support anymore.

01:28:31.421 --> 01:28:33.887
How about you guys?
Were you able to find the traitor?

01:28:35.487 --> 01:28:36.621
Unfortunately, Bey.

01:28:37.121 --> 01:28:38.421
We were suspicious about Kocabash
but we are the one

01:28:38.621 --> 01:28:40.354
who have saved him from Mongols.

01:28:44.887 --> 01:28:48.387
We cannot win this war
without knowing their every step

01:28:48.521 --> 01:28:50.121
and retaliate numerously.

01:28:53.387 --> 01:28:55.454
I have to find out Abdurrahman's
status in a short while.

01:28:56.854 --> 01:28:59.821
In the meanwhile you must
find traitor in nomad group.

01:29:26.721 --> 01:29:27.721
Halime?

01:30:18.721 --> 01:30:20.754
Leave me alone! I said leave me alone!

01:30:21.554 --> 01:30:23.587
Leave me alone!
-Leave her.

01:30:23.687 --> 01:30:25.121
Leave me!

01:30:25.521 --> 01:30:27.221
Whose puppies are you?

01:30:28.387 --> 01:30:29.454
What is going on?

01:30:29.721 --> 01:30:31.654
Do you know who are you attacking to?

01:30:37.221 --> 01:30:40.154
Shut the hell up or I shed your blood.

01:30:43.787 --> 01:30:44.787
Prepare the horses.

01:31:21.787 --> 01:31:23.387
We met you unexpectedly.

01:31:24.354 --> 01:31:25.787
Come here, you Dodurga's kid!

01:31:28.754 --> 01:31:29.754
Come here.

01:31:30.387 --> 01:31:32.321
Come here so we close
that unfinished business.

01:31:35.887 --> 01:31:37.154
Attack!

01:33:11.421 --> 01:33:13.654
Do not be afraid, Goncagul.
We will escape.

01:34:57.554 --> 01:34:58.854
How did you come here, Halime?

01:35:01.721 --> 01:35:03.587
I have followed Dogan and Turgut Alp.

01:35:09.354 --> 01:35:13.854
So Halime Sultan followed you
and you did not notice, did you?

01:35:19.887 --> 01:35:21.121
Excuse us, Bey.

01:35:34.854 --> 01:35:36.721
You are pregnant.
Why did you come here, Halime?

01:35:38.787 --> 01:35:40.487
I found you when we got married.

01:35:42.821 --> 01:35:44.787
But there was separation
in our destiny again.

01:35:47.221 --> 01:35:48.887
I could not put up with longing
for you so here I am.

01:35:50.754 --> 01:35:54.687
Does that longing worth to get yourself
and our baby into danger?

01:35:59.654 --> 01:36:02.321
I do not know how long I will put up
with this anymore, Ertugrul.

01:36:04.754 --> 01:36:06.287
There are fires around us.

01:36:08.654 --> 01:36:11.121
We have no nomad tent
that we can breath in peace.

01:36:15.487 --> 01:36:20.321
Halime Sultan,
you will be brave mother of Kayi.

01:36:22.221 --> 01:36:26.921
A Kayi woman who never gives up
who is steady as a rock

01:36:27.621 --> 01:36:29.654
who never gives quarter.

01:36:32.754 --> 01:36:34.687
I am exhausted, Ertugrul.

01:36:42.754 --> 01:36:47.787
I only become peaceful
when I put my head to your shoulder.

01:36:51.121 --> 01:36:52.421
You are not with me now.

01:36:55.521 --> 01:36:59.154
I dread to bring my son to a world
which he will grow up as a fatherless.

01:37:26.254 --> 01:37:29.921
I promise you and my child

01:37:32.387 --> 01:37:34.854
that I will offer the world
I dream about only

01:37:35.221 --> 01:37:37.254
after sculpting it with my weapon.

01:37:40.921 --> 01:37:44.587
Children of our people will live
in peace on this lands forever.

01:37:47.154 --> 01:37:49.121
They will see this lands
as their motherland.

01:38:02.721 --> 01:38:04.221
You should go to nomad tent now.

01:38:05.587 --> 01:38:07.421
Nobody should know that you met with me.

01:38:08.121 --> 01:38:10.154
When will you be back, Ertugrul?

01:38:14.454 --> 01:38:16.921
I do not want to get nomad group
any trouble because of me.

01:38:27.754 --> 01:38:28.887
I will return in not long time.

01:38:30.721 --> 01:38:32.187
But also not short time.

01:38:33.654 --> 01:38:35.387
But I will return if God permits.

01:38:38.187 --> 01:38:39.687
You believe in my promise, Halime Sultan.

01:38:50.487 --> 01:38:52.854
-Are you okay?
-We owe you our lives.

01:38:54.287 --> 01:38:55.521
Which tribe do you come from?

01:38:55.687 --> 01:38:57.754
I'm Tugtekin who is son of Korkutoglu
from Dodurga Tribe.

01:38:59.721 --> 01:39:00.787
Goncagul Hatun.

01:39:01.187 --> 01:39:02.721
You deserve every peace on both worlds.

01:39:02.821 --> 01:39:05.354
You have saved us from these cruel men.

01:39:06.321 --> 01:39:08.621
-Who were they?
-Kayi's Alps.

01:39:08.821 --> 01:39:10.287
They are traitors.

01:39:11.554 --> 01:39:14.154
They are puppies of Noyan now.
And who are you?

01:39:14.687 --> 01:39:16.654
I am Sultan Aladdin's equerry.

01:39:17.221 --> 01:39:18.521
Atabey Ertokus.

01:39:20.454 --> 01:39:22.154
The Atabey Ertokus?

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:11.321
Welcome, Bey.

01:40:11.687 --> 01:40:14.454
Soldiers from Seljuk are taking a rest
in the valley. There are wounded ones.

01:40:14.554 --> 01:40:16.221
Take care of them right away.

01:40:18.121 --> 01:40:19.254
What is going on, Bey?

01:40:20.754 --> 01:40:22.354
Hamza and Abdurrahman allied with Mongols

01:40:22.487 --> 01:40:24.321
and tried to kill Atabey Ertokus Bey.

01:40:27.821 --> 01:40:29.521
Come on. There are wounded ones.
Get a move on.

01:40:30.121 --> 01:40:31.221
Yes, Bey.

01:40:32.454 --> 01:40:34.421
Come on, let us go to my father's tent.

01:40:34.721 --> 01:40:36.654
I want to see Mother Hayme first.

01:40:37.587 --> 01:40:39.254
I want to share her sorrow.

01:40:43.287 --> 01:40:44.421
As you wish.

01:40:44.621 --> 01:40:47.387
Bogac, take Ertokus Bey
to Mother Hayme's tent.

01:40:47.921 --> 01:40:48.921
Yes, Bey!

01:40:50.854 --> 01:40:51.854
Come on.

01:41:02.354 --> 01:41:03.354
Aunt.

01:41:07.354 --> 01:41:09.287
-Are you fine, Gonca?
-I am fine.

01:41:11.154 --> 01:41:13.387
Brother Tugtekin was there
just in time, aunt.

01:41:13.554 --> 01:41:15.221
If he was a little bit late...

01:41:17.154 --> 01:41:19.521
What did happen? Noyan's men?

01:41:20.521 --> 01:41:21.654
Yes, father.

01:41:22.254 --> 01:41:23.421
Korkut Bey.

01:41:26.854 --> 01:41:28.521
Come, Gonca. Sit there.

01:41:28.754 --> 01:41:32.154
Those muppets Hamza and Abdurrahman
were leading them.

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:36.921
Ertugrul's cunningness is burning us
alive even he is not here.

01:41:38.787 --> 01:41:41.187
-What did they want?
-Ertokus Bey.

01:41:41.554 --> 01:41:42.754
Ertokus?

01:41:44.821 --> 01:41:46.887
Was he in that inn, too?
-Yes.

01:41:52.187 --> 01:41:54.621
Son? You have saved his life, too?

01:41:55.421 --> 01:41:56.521
Yes, father.

01:41:56.721 --> 01:41:58.454
You should have invited him into tent.

01:42:00.121 --> 01:42:01.887
He wanted to go Mother Hayme's tent first.

01:42:03.387 --> 01:42:05.887
He went her tent even though
I have saved their lives.

01:42:06.387 --> 01:42:08.221
He did not come to this tent,
to you, father.

01:42:14.387 --> 01:42:15.554
Are you feeling fine, father?

01:42:21.121 --> 01:42:22.921
I am fine. I am fine.

01:42:26.754 --> 01:42:27.854
Come on.

01:42:28.187 --> 01:42:30.854
Let us leave them alone
and fulfill our longing.

01:42:48.654 --> 01:42:50.254
Come on. Let us go there.

01:42:55.321 --> 01:42:56.387
Sit.

01:42:59.187 --> 01:43:02.354
Tell me about news from Konya.

01:43:03.754 --> 01:43:06.587
Saadettin Kobek did not let my father go.

01:43:07.387 --> 01:43:08.654
He trusts him.

01:43:09.787 --> 01:43:14.854
But if you are really curious
about Sultan's dethroning

01:43:15.854 --> 01:43:18.687
it is just a matter of time, auntie.
You can be sure about it.

01:43:21.487 --> 01:43:23.354
I hope so, my beautiful.

01:43:24.287 --> 01:43:27.921
I hope they dethrones him
so my big brother gets what he wants.

01:43:29.121 --> 01:43:33.487
How could not you and your big brother
get if you want it until now?

01:43:37.521 --> 01:43:40.621
How are things in nomad tent, aunt?
Why did you call me so sudden?

01:43:42.421 --> 01:43:45.621
Your Aunt Aytolun is about to impress
her seal to nomad tent.

01:43:46.621 --> 01:43:47.821
I have no doubt about it.

01:43:52.254 --> 01:43:54.254
I have found a decent husband
for you, Gonca.

01:43:56.154 --> 01:43:57.287
What?

01:43:58.121 --> 01:43:59.287
For me?

01:44:01.821 --> 01:44:04.121
You are best, aunt.
I could not hold my laugh.

01:44:05.721 --> 01:44:07.254
Do not lose your seriousness.

01:44:12.754 --> 01:44:16.187
Who do you want to burn with my fire
and send to hell?

01:44:18.721 --> 01:44:22.254
Suleyman Shah's son Gundogdu.

01:44:35.254 --> 01:44:37.721
We want you to know that we feel
sorry about your lost

01:44:37.854 --> 01:44:40.621
during Mongols attack, Mother Hayme.

01:44:41.521 --> 01:44:45.354
Sultan Aladdin has ordered me
to give his condolences personally.

01:44:46.454 --> 01:44:47.654
Thank you.

01:44:48.254 --> 01:44:51.721
May God always keep Sultan Aladdin
as the head of our state.

01:44:53.254 --> 01:44:57.354
However you suffered only one
affliction from Mongols.

01:44:58.121 --> 01:45:01.487
You personally caused second affliction.

01:45:04.887 --> 01:45:10.454
Discharging and exiling Ertugrul will be
second major affliction for Kayis.

01:45:14.321 --> 01:45:18.354
I know that Ertugrul is great warrior
and a great commander.

01:45:25.321 --> 01:45:26.421
Ertokus Bey.

01:45:27.487 --> 01:45:31.687
We have done what it takes
for the alliance of two nomad groups.

01:45:33.187 --> 01:45:34.921
And about my brother's exile.

01:45:36.587 --> 01:45:40.254
He will come back to his nomad group
one day. This is a temporary decision.

01:45:41.387 --> 01:45:44.821
Mother Hayme personally
made this decision.

01:45:46.754 --> 01:45:47.854
I see.

01:45:48.487 --> 01:45:50.621
I hope you are right, Gundogdu Bey.

01:45:52.654 --> 01:45:57.254
However, I want to talk to Ertugrul Bey
about a really important matter.

01:45:58.421 --> 01:46:02.187
Tell him that he must find me
if you see him.

01:46:21.854 --> 01:46:23.521
Do you mind, sister Hayme?

01:46:25.587 --> 01:46:27.121
Of course not, Korkut Bey.

01:46:27.354 --> 01:46:30.921
There is no such thing between
Beys of two nomad groups

01:46:31.721 --> 01:46:33.454
who is sharing a common fate.

01:46:40.621 --> 01:46:43.821
-Welcome, Ertokus Bey.
-I am not welcomed, Korkut Bey.

01:46:45.521 --> 01:46:49.221
What I heard made me upset
just as pains you have been through.

01:46:50.321 --> 01:46:52.787
I hope you recant your fault
as soon as possible.

01:46:55.221 --> 01:46:57.454
Which fault you are talking
about, Ertokus Bey?

01:46:58.121 --> 01:46:59.487
Exile of Ertugrul.

01:47:04.754 --> 01:47:08.721
What Ertugrul has said to you
is correct word by word.

01:47:10.121 --> 01:47:13.321
Noyan was here to batter Alps before war.

01:47:13.787 --> 01:47:16.187
And I am here to inspect
brave nomad groups.

01:47:17.121 --> 01:47:21.287
I see that Noyan is causing troubles
to every nomad group.

01:47:22.887 --> 01:47:25.921
And he is personally dealing
biggest two nomad groups.

01:47:28.521 --> 01:47:32.921
You have the worst winter ahead of you.
Not only Erzurum's merciless cold

01:47:33.787 --> 01:47:38.154
but also Noyan's ambushs and traps
will freeze your hearts.

01:47:48.154 --> 01:47:51.287
I hope you leave this duty to the people
who know it best

01:47:51.887 --> 01:47:55.354
so me and Sultan Aladdin do not
worry about here.

01:48:02.454 --> 01:48:04.754
So you are saying to the person
who saved your life

01:48:04.921 --> 01:48:07.654
that he is not good
at his job, Atabey Ertokus?

01:48:12.321 --> 01:48:15.587
If I think you are not best at your job
I will just tell it.

01:48:17.487 --> 01:48:19.321
However Ertugrul is a different person.

01:48:20.587 --> 01:48:24.687
Only a person like Ertugrul
can overcome scumbag like Noyan.

01:48:43.521 --> 01:48:44.787
Excuse me now.

01:48:47.321 --> 01:48:50.721
I want to take a rest. We talk again.

01:48:54.721 --> 01:48:58.454
-Ertokus Bey will be guest in my tent.
-Yes, Bey.

01:49:02.821 --> 01:49:04.121
Excuse me.

01:49:29.064 --> 01:49:30.864
Look at brave Alps of Kayi!

01:49:31.964 --> 01:49:36.664
They came back as dogs to lick the hand
who throws them bone.

01:49:36.998 --> 01:49:40.431
-Listen first, Noyan!
-Listen what? Listen what?

01:49:41.098 --> 01:49:45.031
We thought you are Alps but
you have failed and came back.

01:49:47.931 --> 01:49:49.698
You are nothing for me!

01:49:51.364 --> 01:49:52.831
Nothing!
-Bey!

01:49:57.898 --> 01:50:02.098
You were always talking about bravery!
But you could not capture a man!

01:50:05.564 --> 01:50:06.931
You are dead to me anymore.

01:50:08.364 --> 01:50:12.531
You are not different than a dead mouse.

01:50:55.064 --> 01:50:58.764
Ertugrul Bey should know that
Ertokus wants to talk to him.

01:51:01.698 --> 01:51:03.764
-He will know.
-How?

01:51:05.764 --> 01:51:08.698
Ertugrul Bey supposed to go back
to Geyikli today.

01:51:09.664 --> 01:51:12.364
Dogan's horse is quick.
It will not give any problem on road.

01:51:20.664 --> 01:51:21.664
Dogan.

01:51:22.098 --> 01:51:23.398
Dogan!

01:51:28.464 --> 01:51:30.598
-Yes, Master Demir?
-I got something to say.

01:51:37.931 --> 01:51:39.598
Thank you, Turgut Alp.

01:51:41.664 --> 01:51:43.598
Thank you, Halime Sultan.

01:51:58.398 --> 01:52:03.298
We should not pay it if spies of
great Mongols gave wrong information

01:52:03.964 --> 01:52:05.931
to a great commander like Noyan.

01:52:06.498 --> 01:52:07.698
What do you mean?

01:52:07.898 --> 01:52:13.298
We have failed because Tugtekin knew that
you were going to send your men there.

01:52:13.698 --> 01:52:14.831
That is not possible.

01:52:14.964 --> 01:52:17.564
If that is not possible
what was he doing there?

01:52:20.331 --> 01:52:23.498
If Tugtekin did not show up
we would have done it already, Bey.

01:52:24.864 --> 01:52:27.731
If the intelligence you got from
your spies was not solid

01:52:28.064 --> 01:52:29.864
then we are not the guilty one.

01:52:34.431 --> 01:52:36.964
Now, kill us.

01:52:38.764 --> 01:52:41.798
Kill us so you relax and we relax.

01:52:50.098 --> 01:52:53.831
I do not know your spies
in Konya or nomad group.

01:52:56.364 --> 01:52:57.998
And it is not my problem.

01:52:59.331 --> 01:53:03.631
However I think you should be careful
before acting after you get

01:53:03.931 --> 01:53:05.564
any intelligence from your spies.

01:53:06.864 --> 01:53:11.298
Or Mongols could not pass the steep
mountains of Erzurum easily.

01:53:29.698 --> 01:53:34.864
One day I will cut off your tongue
and have a feast with it.

01:54:03.831 --> 01:54:05.031
Halime.

01:54:06.564 --> 01:54:08.331
Do you have any news from Ertugrul?

01:54:10.364 --> 01:54:11.831
No, I do not know where he is.

01:54:19.064 --> 01:54:21.298
I am sure that he will be so happy, too.

01:54:22.298 --> 01:54:24.364
When he hears about I am getting married.

01:54:24.498 --> 01:54:25.964
Of course he will.

01:54:27.531 --> 01:54:30.531
Which brother wouldn't be happy
to see his sister's marriage?

01:54:33.898 --> 01:54:34.898
And you?

01:54:36.964 --> 01:54:40.664
Will you also be happy
if my mother gives me to them?

01:54:43.698 --> 01:54:47.331
I do not know if we see each other
after separation of nomad tents.

01:54:49.298 --> 01:54:51.664
But I want to remember you
as a good person, Gokce.

01:54:53.431 --> 01:54:55.798
Despite everything we have been through.

01:54:58.598 --> 01:55:01.098
-Will you be able to do that?
-And you?

01:55:04.398 --> 01:55:06.464
Will you be able to remember me
as a good person?

01:55:11.598 --> 01:55:12.731
Where is Selcan?

01:55:16.564 --> 01:55:17.698
She is sleeping, mother.

01:55:18.664 --> 01:55:21.298
She said she does not feel well
and will not come tonight.

01:55:27.631 --> 01:55:31.064
Fine. Make it quick, girls.
We have a lot to do.

01:55:32.564 --> 01:55:33.564
Come on.

01:55:44.664 --> 01:55:48.798
Ertugrul's reputation on
Sultan Alaeddin's eye is great.

01:55:51.898 --> 01:55:57.498
For years we have been grazing our
animals, but he was in Aleppo for war.

01:55:59.898 --> 01:56:02.031
He always led the war against Mongols.

01:56:03.298 --> 01:56:04.598
So it is normal.

01:56:05.298 --> 01:56:10.731
But seigniory you want to build
for years will become a dream

01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:15.331
if Ertugrul does not lose his reputation.

01:56:16.031 --> 01:56:19.531
Ertugrul will get the margrave
which you wanted

01:56:20.298 --> 01:56:21.898
from Sultan Alaeddin for years.

01:56:28.698 --> 01:56:32.764
You will solve these matters one by one.

01:56:34.964 --> 01:56:37.964
Let us see our Tugtekin's marriage first.

01:56:39.298 --> 01:56:41.331
Everything will be changed.

01:56:43.298 --> 01:56:44.864
Tonight is the night.

01:57:16.864 --> 01:57:19.998
Brothers, let me take a rest.
I will come and see you.

01:57:31.298 --> 01:57:33.764
-Who was that commander?
-Atabey Ertokus.

01:57:34.898 --> 01:57:36.664
What are you saying, Kocabash?

01:57:37.398 --> 01:57:39.831
Noyan supposed to kill him?

01:57:41.731 --> 01:57:44.331
Abdurrahman and Hamza
encountered Tugtekin.

01:57:46.531 --> 01:57:48.931
God damn it. What will we do?

01:57:49.864 --> 01:57:53.731
Noyan wanted to learn a secret
from Atabey Ertokus since long time.

01:57:55.898 --> 01:57:58.564
I must find out that secret.
-How?

01:58:01.631 --> 01:58:04.664
He will stay at Korkut Bey's tent tonight.

01:58:05.631 --> 01:58:07.898
Tugtekin and others
will go to ask the girl.

01:58:08.631 --> 01:58:09.798
So?

01:58:10.664 --> 01:58:12.531
So he will be alone in tent.

01:58:12.998 --> 01:58:15.331
And I will sneak into tent and finish it.

01:58:57.464 --> 01:58:58.598
What is it, Dogan?

01:58:59.998 --> 01:59:01.598
Ertokus Bey is there, Bey.

01:59:07.798 --> 01:59:10.898
Abdurrahman and Hamza
raid Kervansaray to take him.

01:59:11.798 --> 01:59:13.764
-And?
-He is at nomad tent now.

01:59:17.631 --> 01:59:18.631
Nice.

01:59:19.964 --> 01:59:22.464
It means Abdurrahman convinced Noyan.

01:59:24.564 --> 01:59:26.831
We have sent a pigeon
into snake's nest, brother.

01:59:32.431 --> 01:59:35.798
Ertokus Bey said Mother Hayme
that he wants to see you.

01:59:36.931 --> 01:59:38.298
I guess it is important.

01:59:38.498 --> 01:59:40.664
Wild Demir and Artuk Bey
wanted me to let you know.

01:59:45.964 --> 01:59:47.764
Nobody should see that I talk to him.

01:59:49.564 --> 01:59:51.598
You are correct but
how will it be happen, Bey?

01:59:52.531 --> 01:59:54.898
He is going to leave with his soldiers
first thing in the morning.

01:59:56.864 --> 01:59:59.898
-I will come to nomad tent tonight.
-What are you saying, Bey?

02:00:01.964 --> 02:00:03.531
Listen to me carefully, Dogan.

02:00:03.864 --> 02:00:06.031
Go to Ertokus Bey and say:

02:00:06.731 --> 02:00:09.731
"Ertugrul Bey will meet you
near nomad group tonight."

02:00:46.798 --> 02:00:47.798
Uncle.

02:00:48.831 --> 02:00:51.631
Welcome. Glad to see you.

02:00:53.398 --> 02:00:54.764
Greetings, Gundogdu.

02:00:56.631 --> 02:00:58.964
-Welcome all.
-Greetings.

02:01:00.064 --> 02:01:03.598
I have always heard your name
along with Ertugrul Bey, Bey.

02:01:05.431 --> 02:01:07.531
In Konya, in Erzurum, in Malatya.

02:01:10.898 --> 02:01:13.564
Is it possible for them not to hear
such brave guy like Gundogdu?

02:01:14.631 --> 02:01:16.364
Not at all! Not at all!

02:01:21.798 --> 02:01:23.031
Our bride is here.

02:01:28.731 --> 02:01:30.598
-Welcome.
-Greetings.

02:01:32.564 --> 02:01:34.931
Goncagul, this is Gokce.

02:01:47.398 --> 02:01:48.864
Where is Selcan Hatun?

02:01:50.364 --> 02:01:54.098
Selcan is sick. She is sleeping.
I did not want to wake her up.

02:01:59.598 --> 02:02:01.931
-Get well soon.
-Thank you.

02:02:02.998 --> 02:02:05.531
Come on, let us go inside. Come on.

02:02:24.564 --> 02:02:27.064
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

02:02:29.898 --> 02:02:32.631
Welcome.
-Greetings, sister Hayme.

02:02:33.731 --> 02:02:34.731
Please.

02:02:43.364 --> 02:02:44.364
Please.

02:02:54.464 --> 02:02:55.598
My girl...

02:02:57.064 --> 02:02:58.431
...sit down.

02:05:38.864 --> 02:05:39.864
Come.

02:07:29.731 --> 02:07:31.564
I want to take a walk, Alps.

02:07:34.031 --> 02:07:35.598
I will walk alone.

02:07:36.031 --> 02:07:38.931
Do not worry.
I am safe in friends' nomad group.

02:07:39.998 --> 02:07:41.764
I must digest that I ate.

02:09:27.298 --> 02:09:28.598
I heard that you are looking for me.

02:09:30.298 --> 02:09:31.431
Ertugrul.

02:09:37.664 --> 02:09:38.731
Ertugrul?

02:09:42.431 --> 02:09:43.731
My brave brother.

02:09:44.398 --> 02:09:49.364
Thanks to God I have seen you
while I am alive. That is enough for me.
