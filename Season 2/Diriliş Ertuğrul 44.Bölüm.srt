00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 44 will start after 12:27 min.

12:27.407 --> 12:31.407
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:32.592 --> 12:36.259
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:36.617 --> 12:39.617
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

13:09.653 --> 13:10.820
My dear mother.

13:13.086 --> 13:14.320
My beautiful mother.

13:34.786 --> 13:35.853
I am back, mother.

13:37.453 --> 13:38.486
I am back.

15:06.053 --> 15:07.420
Do not worry, mother.

15:09.853 --> 15:11.486
I will recover with the help of God.

15:20.353 --> 15:25.820
Mongol's blade may cut my flesh,
But it is not enough to kill me.

15:29.420 --> 15:30.420
I will not...

15:33.820 --> 15:36.586
...go anywhere before I eat your
bulgur pilaf with meat...

15:37.486 --> 15:39.453
...and chickpeas tonight.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.753
I would die for you, son.

16:08.786 --> 16:09.820
Welcome, Sungur.

16:10.986 --> 16:13.520
Thank you, brother. Well met.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.586
No matter how far I was...

16:22.086 --> 16:24.953
...my heart was always with you.

16:33.886 --> 16:37.353
-Ishak, prepare here immediately.
-Yes, Artuk Bey.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.720
My Bey, excuse me.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.120
Hayme Hatun, excuse me.

16:55.320 --> 17:00.353
Artuk Bey, I entrust my son's life to
God and your hands.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.553
God willing.

17:06.086 --> 17:07.120
Come along, mother.

17:23.453 --> 17:24.453
My Bey.

17:25.720 --> 17:26.786
In the name of God.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.786
Let us begin with the name of God.

18:04.886 --> 18:06.553
With the name of God.

18:16.953 --> 18:20.020
Where did Ertugrul Bey find Sungur Tekin?

18:21.986 --> 18:23.953
We don't know what happened too,
Aytolun Hatun.

18:25.586 --> 18:27.820
Since he did not come here by himself

18:28.753 --> 18:32.053
he went to battle with Alps
to find his brother.

18:34.586 --> 18:36.420
Ertugrul Bey did as he pleased again.

18:37.353 --> 18:40.486
Thanks to God, nothing worse
happened to them.

18:41.853 --> 18:43.686
You would be happy, if it did I guess.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.886
Sister, don't start
in a day like this please.

18:48.020 --> 18:51.420
Sure Aytolun, our troubles doubled, right?

18:55.553 --> 19:01.653
As you can see, our respected words are
bent and misunderstood intentionally.

19:03.686 --> 19:07.886
There is nothing to do against this
wicked woman...

19:08.786 --> 19:11.653
...except to leave her to God's will?

19:13.019 --> 19:14.019
Selcan!

19:24.720 --> 19:25.720
Mother!

19:46.920 --> 19:47.920
Hayme?

19:50.053 --> 19:51.320
How is my nephew?

19:54.620 --> 19:55.686
He doesn't show...

19:58.120 --> 19:59.720
...but his wound is very bad.

20:02.786 --> 20:05.720
You made us very happy by bringing
Sungur Bey back. We believed

20:05.886 --> 20:07.686
he was dead for years.

20:08.786 --> 20:10.020
May God help him.

20:11.320 --> 20:12.620
Thank you, Gumustekin Bey.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.886
How did it happen? Who did you fight with?

20:19.953 --> 20:21.820
We faced with Noyan and his soldiers.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.853
How is this possible, Ertugrul Bey?

20:30.353 --> 20:31.853
You sent us after Noyan.

20:33.386 --> 20:34.653
Then you disappeared.

20:35.986 --> 20:39.420
You did not come to the battle you asked,
now you say that you found Noyan.

20:41.453 --> 20:43.953
Your secrets scare us all.

20:55.053 --> 21:00.820
It is obvious that Sungurtekin
and Noyan got together somehow.

21:02.553 --> 21:03.920
That's not what I want to know.

21:05.586 --> 21:07.720
I want to know how did you find them,
my Bey?

21:17.020 --> 21:18.953
Mere coincidence, Gumustekin Bey.

21:21.686 --> 21:25.486
We dedicated our lives to
put an end to this Mongolian plague.

21:30.420 --> 21:36.820
Thankfully, I was able to bring
Sungurtekin back to his nomad group.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.720
What kind of coincidence is this

21:46.886 --> 21:49.353
to make Ertugrul Bey fell into their lap?

22:01.553 --> 22:04.620
I heard that you overcame
all of Noyan's traps

22:05.520 --> 22:07.120
and turned back to nomad group victorious.

22:08.520 --> 22:11.020
May God makes your victories everlasting.

22:13.386 --> 22:15.753
This is not the case Ertugrul, we beli...

22:15.953 --> 22:18.720
Shadows are becoming longer
each passing day...

22:20.086 --> 22:23.620
...and our enemies are
breathing down our necks...

22:25.920 --> 22:27.486
...what are you after really?

22:41.420 --> 22:44.453
If it was not for you,
we wouldn't be celebrating victory

22:45.120 --> 22:48.120
but suffer under Noyan's tyranny.

22:49.820 --> 22:51.753
We will never forget what you did for us,
my Bey.

22:53.320 --> 22:55.653
However, Tugtekin Bey is right.

22:56.920 --> 23:01.386
Even though you have a pure heart,
it's doors are sealed shut against us.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.853
Without breaking this seal,
how can we trust you?

23:08.086 --> 23:09.420
Enough.

23:11.820 --> 23:12.986
Enough, stop it.

23:15.086 --> 23:19.620
It is not right to talk about such matters
while we have a patient inside.

23:26.420 --> 23:29.620
My son, Sungurtekin returned home.

23:32.653 --> 23:34.520
Don't take away my happiness.

23:35.753 --> 23:39.086
Go and settle your scores in your marquee.

23:44.020 --> 23:47.553
The blood Noyan had spilled
is finally avanged.

23:52.886 --> 23:56.953
We are bathed in the glory of victory.
What else do you want?

24:53.986 --> 24:55.986
Sigil of Oghuz Khan will go to Ogeday.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.520
Ogeday will increase his power
with this sigil.

25:04.686 --> 25:08.653
Emotions will flow among the Turks
in the army with this sigil.

25:11.453 --> 25:16.320
Their eagerness will strengten
the position of the Khan of the World.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.886
We all know the respect Turks show to
Oghuz Khan.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.953
If Sungurtekin returns to his homeland
with this sigil...

25:28.620 --> 25:29.920
...our army will split in two.

25:31.086 --> 25:33.320
And Ogeday will make us pay for it.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.720
We cannot let it happen.

25:40.953 --> 25:42.053
We will not.

25:44.386 --> 25:47.720
They will bring me
the sigil of Oghuz Khan.

25:56.586 --> 25:57.586
How?

27:23.516 --> 27:24.516
We shall begin, Ishak.

27:26.216 --> 27:27.416
May God help us.

27:28.182 --> 27:29.649
In deference to the name of Shafii.

27:38.849 --> 27:39.849
Are you ready, Bey?

27:50.582 --> 27:52.249
In the name of Allah!

28:16.749 --> 28:17.749
Dear God!

28:18.849 --> 28:22.282
Thankfully, you made me see my son
before he dies.

28:24.349 --> 28:26.416
I am begging you, please have mercy on
him.

28:45.482 --> 28:47.816
Please do not take him from me so soon.
-Amen.

28:48.616 --> 28:49.716
-Amen.
-Amen.

28:49.916 --> 28:50.916
Amen.

28:55.316 --> 28:58.382
Mother. All our troubles
will come to an end, mother.

28:59.349 --> 29:01.382
If God permits they will all be over,
do not worry.

29:57.582 --> 29:59.849
-Ertugrul.
-Halime Sultan.

30:14.882 --> 30:16.516
Come, Bey, you are tired.
We should sit here.

30:28.349 --> 30:30.149
Ertugrul, what was Noyan doing there?

30:35.549 --> 30:36.849
He was after Sungurtekin.

30:41.216 --> 30:43.449
We killed all his soldiers
with Sungurtekin.

30:45.516 --> 30:48.549
Noyan could escape wounded.

30:53.916 --> 30:56.682
You dispossessed first his cave, then his
soldiers...

30:58.449 --> 31:00.282
and now you Sungurtekin from his.

31:04.282 --> 31:06.216
From now on you are
his only enemy, Ertugrul.

31:08.349 --> 31:09.716
He will not stop
until he kills you.

31:12.849 --> 31:15.316
I am also afraid of his
anger, Halime Sultan.

31:18.116 --> 31:19.316
But not for myself.

31:21.516 --> 31:26.182
He knows everything about both marquees
as much as we do.

31:28.549 --> 31:29.749
Ambission of Tugtekin,...

31:31.316 --> 31:32.716
...weaknesses of my uncle.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.549
And even...

31:40.316 --> 31:41.916
...our child you bear.

31:43.516 --> 31:46.282
<i>Speak for the sake of Ertugrul's child,</i>
 <i>Halime Sultan.</i>

31:49.482 --> 31:53.816
<i>If not, I will rip your bastard out,</i>
 <i>with my own hands!</i>

32:07.316 --> 32:09.249
Ertugrul, there are also these things
that Selcan told.

32:15.482 --> 32:16.782
I know everything, Halime Sultan.

32:18.682 --> 32:22.616
Aytolun and Gumustekin both look
as if they respect to you.

32:24.682 --> 32:29.549
They smile to your face but I see
how much they beware of you.

32:32.149 --> 32:33.582
There are some things that are not pure.

32:34.816 --> 32:36.782
Selcan is also not aware of that.

32:38.749 --> 32:42.282
Do you think that Gundogdu can not accept
it because he will marry to Goncagul?

32:47.116 --> 32:50.749
Whatever happens, do not leave
Selcan alone.

32:56.782 --> 33:00.716
But respect to that girl

33:03.249 --> 33:04.849
whom my brother will get married to.

33:08.316 --> 33:09.749
When I am back, I would want to know
everything.

33:12.382 --> 33:13.416
Ertugrul.

33:16.716 --> 33:18.316
I am going on a long journey, Halime
Sultan.

33:24.649 --> 33:26.149
I made you a promise, Ertugrul.

33:27.382 --> 33:28.882
Whatever you do, you do it well.

33:30.882 --> 33:32.416
Even if you set off the roads
that I have never seen before...

33:32.582 --> 33:34.116
...my heart is always with you.

33:35.882 --> 33:37.416
But this time is different.

33:39.782 --> 33:41.916
Not knowing where you are planning to go,
really scares me.

33:44.216 --> 33:45.549
I do not know what you are
going to encounter.

33:48.682 --> 33:51.349
Crazy horses inside of me tell me
that it is time, Halime Sultan.

33:57.282 --> 33:58.516
I hope that one day, those
crazy horses will tell you...

33:58.716 --> 34:00.516
...not to leave Halime Hatun alone
anymore.

34:17.682 --> 34:19.582
It is said that separation expands love,
Halime Sultan.

34:25.182 --> 34:27.616
It is obvious that my heart will always
long for you, Ertugrul.

34:29.382 --> 34:30.782
May separations not be in hearts.

34:32.682 --> 34:33.816
I am always with you.

34:50.616 --> 34:54.216
Our Beys showed the whole nomad group
what means being brave.

34:55.616 --> 34:58.882
Everybody is talking about Gundogdu and
they have Tugtekin in their hearts.

34:59.749 --> 35:02.682
An the bravery of my father.
People are speaking mostly about him.

35:03.916 --> 35:05.682
He went to war with a wounded leg...

35:06.182 --> 35:08.416
...but shedded so much
Mongolian blood, aunt.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.782
While everybody was expecting
Gumustekin to return back...

35:13.116 --> 35:15.549
...from palace of sultan fustily...

35:16.416 --> 35:20.349
...thank God, he proved everybody
how brave he is.

35:20.849 --> 35:21.916
Thank God.

35:24.882 --> 35:27.182
I have not seen hide nor hair of Selcan,
Aunt.

35:28.149 --> 35:32.849
She must have burried herself in her
widow woman tent, when she was snubbed.

35:34.916 --> 35:38.282
You should know that, this black snake
will not remain calm.

35:38.782 --> 35:40.749
She must be after something.

35:41.582 --> 35:45.849
Until we get rid of her,
please do not dodge the column.

35:47.716 --> 35:51.749
Non of us will have peace until that bitch
dies, you should know it.

36:25.149 --> 36:26.849
-Selcan Hatun.
-Banu Cicek.

36:31.649 --> 36:33.682
You are all grown up now. God bless you.

36:35.116 --> 36:38.316
I have heard that you ride horse and
use weapon like a man, right?

36:39.516 --> 36:43.182
I remember the first time you came to our
nomad group with Suleyman Shah.

36:43.849 --> 36:46.616
You and Gokce taught me
how to ride a horse, Selcan Hatun.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.516
So, you also remember
those beautiful days.

36:51.149 --> 36:53.816
How can I ever forget? Your visits
were making me so happy.

36:59.716 --> 37:04.382
We both grew up in the marquee of
Korkut Bey and Suleyman Shah.

37:05.549 --> 37:07.782
We learned love and respect from them.

37:09.682 --> 37:12.449
Now it is time to pay our debts
back to my martyr father...

37:12.649 --> 37:15.416
...without embarrassing him, Banu Cicek.

37:17.549 --> 37:19.216
What are you saying, Selcan Hatun?

37:22.649 --> 37:26.182
Our nomad group has fallen into a
depravement like an endless swirl.

37:27.449 --> 37:30.416
I want you to help me in order
to get rid of this malice.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.316
But do not say the things
I told you to anyone else.

37:33.682 --> 37:35.849
Selcan Hatun, your words are scaring me.

37:36.682 --> 37:38.249
Tell me what you are trying to tell me
for God's sake.

37:39.182 --> 37:40.849
I do not want anyone to see
us together.

37:42.382 --> 37:44.349
I will wait for you in the meadow
out of the nomad tent.

37:45.116 --> 37:47.582
I will tell you everything
there, alright?

38:00.649 --> 38:01.649
May it be easy.

38:31.682 --> 38:33.582
I came quickly right after
I heard what happened, Noyan.

39:17.382 --> 39:19.816
I have always appreciated your
loyalty, Efrasiyab.

39:23.916 --> 39:26.216
Now I will ask something from you
that is more important than...

39:29.116 --> 39:30.149
...anything else.

39:32.182 --> 39:33.749
What can I do for you, Noyan?

39:36.449 --> 39:38.149
Sungurtekin has a seal.

39:39.682 --> 39:44.716
You will help the sons of Suleyman Shah
to bring that seal to me.

39:49.749 --> 39:53.616
I will do anyting you want from me
but entering to the...

39:53.782 --> 39:55.816
You will kidnap a woman from the family...

39:58.816 --> 40:00.116
...not the seal.

40:01.216 --> 40:02.416
You will bring me the woman.

40:06.349 --> 40:09.649
Then they will bring me the seal.

40:14.549 --> 40:15.616
Whatever you say.

40:22.782 --> 40:25.882
Is my loyal cur Hamza...

40:27.916 --> 40:29.149
...still alive?

40:32.916 --> 40:34.716
In the morning, he will be beheaded
by Gundogdu.

40:39.749 --> 40:40.882
He will die honourably.

40:45.882 --> 40:47.216
May spirits be with him.

40:49.349 --> 40:50.649
Now listen to me carefully.

40:53.182 --> 40:55.282
I will tell you how you are
going to do this.

41:10.416 --> 41:12.349
Banu Cicek! Come here!

41:26.516 --> 41:28.282
We are in a blind hole.

41:30.116 --> 41:33.716
It is our duty to save our nomad groups
from this malice.

41:34.682 --> 41:37.282
What are you saying, Selcan Hatun?
I do not understand. How?

41:38.816 --> 41:43.149
There is a calamity that poisons both
nomad groups in the marquee of Korkut Bey.

41:45.149 --> 41:48.682
You are the only one that can help me
to get rid of this calamity.

41:48.882 --> 41:50.182
What calamity?

41:50.816 --> 41:52.816
You understand who I am
talking about, right?

41:53.882 --> 41:56.682
I am talking about the woman that
Korkut Bey assigned you even to risk...

41:56.882 --> 41:58.549
...your life for if needed.

41:59.682 --> 42:03.282
How can you tell me this?
Do not you have any conscience?

42:05.382 --> 42:07.749
How can you talk about Great Korkut Bey
like this?

42:08.382 --> 42:10.416
Right. He is The Great Korkut Bey!

42:10.616 --> 42:13.482
But his wife is the curse of us all!

42:14.316 --> 42:17.816
The whole Nomad group, The Dodurga marquee
of Korkut Bey... I am telling you.

42:18.149 --> 42:20.916
She is going to poison us all!
We have to prevent it!

42:21.482 --> 42:24.182
You have lost your mind. How can yo...

42:24.382 --> 42:28.182
If you help me find what this Aytolun
bitch is hiding in the marquee...

42:28.482 --> 42:29.682
Enough!

42:30.649 --> 42:32.316
I can not betray neither my Bey
nor my Hanim.

42:34.516 --> 42:38.549
Do not ever get close to me
or I will make you regret it.

44:01.849 --> 44:03.549
<i>What goes around comes around, Hamza Alp.</i>

44:04.716 --> 44:07.516
<i>Dear God, I did so many bad things.</i>

44:08.549 --> 44:09.849
<i>I seduced too many valiants.</i>

44:11.482 --> 44:14.616
<i>My arrogance prevented me from seeing the</i>
 <i>truth. Please forgive me.</i>

44:16.216 --> 44:19.316
<i>Give me the opportunity to serve this</i>
 <i>nomad group, for one last time.</i>

44:39.816 --> 44:41.749
-Selcan.
-Come in, Halime.

44:48.116 --> 44:49.649
Welcome.
-Thank you, Selcan.

44:57.316 --> 44:58.549
How is Sungurtekin?

45:01.249 --> 45:02.849
Artuk Bey is still watching him, Selcan.

45:05.382 --> 45:09.382
They are polluting the nomad group of
my father as they wish.

45:10.316 --> 45:15.482
They poison us with their endless
ambitions, by laughing in our faces!

45:16.116 --> 45:17.549
-Selcan.
-Halime!

45:18.682 --> 45:23.582
I do not need consolation, I need
a sister to fight for our nomad group.

45:24.582 --> 45:25.649
What does it mean?

45:27.916 --> 45:31.416
That old woman, who killed her Halime?

45:32.182 --> 45:33.182
Why did she get killed?

45:35.682 --> 45:38.916
There are things both Aytolun and
Korkut Bey are hiding from us. I know it.

45:40.149 --> 45:41.649
What do you think they are hiding from us,
Selcan?

45:43.782 --> 45:46.882
As Aytolun could come to the marquee and
settled there...

45:49.349 --> 45:53.849
...I say that Aytolun killed the first
wife of Korkut Bey.

45:55.316 --> 45:56.816
Selcan, how are we going to prove it?

45:59.149 --> 46:01.182
First we need to find the necklace.

46:02.249 --> 46:05.582
Then we will prove it step by step.

46:07.416 --> 46:10.549
Now tell me Halime,
are you with me in this?

46:19.249 --> 46:20.249
Yes, I am, Selcan.

46:23.249 --> 46:24.316
My dear sister!

46:26.449 --> 46:27.549
My dear sister!

46:54.716 --> 46:58.482
Sungurtekin must have a connection
with Sultan Aleaddin.

47:00.349 --> 47:02.916
And also with Halime and Wild Demir's
leaving the nomad group.

47:05.216 --> 47:06.482
What are they after, father?

47:07.682 --> 47:09.349
It will become clear soon.

47:10.516 --> 47:12.216
That bitch Selcan was right.

47:13.549 --> 47:15.249
Trouble became two, while it was only one.

47:15.849 --> 47:19.116
Arrival of Sungurtekin will not be
good for us, brother.

47:23.749 --> 47:27.282
We can not move before we hear from
Sadettin Kobek.

47:28.582 --> 47:30.849
When there are no obstacles left
ahead of me being The Margrave...

47:32.482 --> 47:36.916
...sons of Suleyman Shah won't mean
anything to me anymore.

47:40.216 --> 47:43.816
They will only be details like an insect
to smash or a bone to spit.

47:49.582 --> 47:51.449
As long as the news I am waiting for
arrives.

48:07.482 --> 48:11.316
When Sungurtekin has been captured
by Mongolians, I was so small.

48:12.449 --> 48:14.482
I do not remember neither him
nor what has happened.

48:17.416 --> 48:18.649
Where has he been for all this time?

48:20.216 --> 48:21.316
What is his issue with Noyan?

48:23.282 --> 48:25.116
What kind of a relationship
he has with Ertugrul, Gokce?

48:26.416 --> 48:27.482
I understand you, Bey.

48:29.816 --> 48:31.749
Both Ertugrul and Gundogdu are tough men.

48:33.882 --> 48:35.116
Now there is Sungurtekin too.

48:36.682 --> 48:38.449
I want the best for both nomad groups.
You know it.

48:39.116 --> 48:40.116
I know, my Bey.

48:43.782 --> 48:45.649
If I do not know what is happening,
I can not take precautions.

48:47.716 --> 48:49.849
Look Gokce, your home is my marquee now.

48:51.316 --> 48:54.682
For the sake of both nomad groups,
tell me whatever you see or hear...

48:54.849 --> 48:56.282
...so that I can take precautions.

49:01.282 --> 49:02.382
Do not worry, Bey.

49:20.716 --> 49:22.482
They are after spooky things again,
father.

49:24.416 --> 49:26.116
I am afraid we will be in trouble again.

49:27.249 --> 49:31.516
After everything that has happened, you
still do not trust Ertugrul, son.

49:32.682 --> 49:33.916
How can I trust him, father?

49:35.882 --> 49:37.882
He is lying us by smiling at our faces.

49:38.849 --> 49:41.816
There are things he hides from you,
me, even his mother and his brother.

49:44.382 --> 49:47.682
Ertugrul is not a coward and not a
betrayer at all. I know that.

49:48.749 --> 49:50.716
If I do not know your loyalty
to nomad group...

49:52.716 --> 49:55.582
...if I do not know that your heart is
as strong as your body...

49:57.916 --> 50:00.616
...I would say that, you are jealous
of his achievements.

50:03.449 --> 50:06.616
He established a marquee within a marquee,
a state within a state.

50:08.782 --> 50:12.549
Without being aware of these, how come you
want to establish a seigniory, father?

50:52.382 --> 50:55.882
While your brother is facing with death...

50:56.582 --> 50:57.882
...where did this journey come from,
Ertugrul?

50:59.649 --> 51:02.182
-It is necessary, brother.
-Is it necessary?

51:03.582 --> 51:04.749
What do you mean it is necessary?

51:05.816 --> 51:08.516
You do not explaim anything neither to me
nor my mother.

51:12.849 --> 51:14.149
I will tell you when it is the right time.

51:15.216 --> 51:18.149
What did you tell us on the right time now
you are claiming that you will tell this?

51:19.149 --> 51:20.816
You said that you were going to meet
with Sungurtekin...

51:21.316 --> 51:22.482
...instead, you fought with Noyan.

51:22.782 --> 51:26.182
What kind of business is this, brother?
What kind of a world you are living in?

51:27.149 --> 51:29.182
How did you learn Sungurtekin was there?

51:29.449 --> 51:31.516
How did Noyan learn you were there?

51:34.482 --> 51:36.282
I want to know it not only as
your brother...

51:36.549 --> 51:40.216
...but also as The Head of Alps of this
nomad group. This is my duty.

51:42.382 --> 51:46.316
But you do not say anything
neither to me nor my mother.

51:53.782 --> 51:57.549
When you said you will obey me,
this was what you meant?

51:59.149 --> 52:00.182
Is this obeying?

52:02.882 --> 52:05.716
When you are in trouble, you tell me
that I am with you to death.

52:07.616 --> 52:10.882
But when it comes to telling something,
you do not tell anything.

52:11.516 --> 52:12.849
Every step you take is a secret.

52:26.516 --> 52:30.582
Brother, one day I will tell you
everything as it is.

52:32.449 --> 52:33.782
But today is not the day.

52:34.682 --> 52:36.216
-Brother!
-Gundogdu.

52:37.916 --> 52:40.149
Enough already. Enough, son.

52:43.582 --> 52:46.182
Your brother is facing with death inside.

52:48.382 --> 52:49.382
Mother.

52:50.649 --> 52:54.816
When even I can not stand what Ertugrul
is doing, how The Dodurgans will?

52:55.816 --> 52:58.849
What he does, with whom he competes with
is not clear!

52:59.882 --> 53:00.882
Brother...

53:24.382 --> 53:25.616
I will be back soon, mother.

53:26.449 --> 53:27.482
Do not worry.

53:36.249 --> 53:39.316
If you go and do not come back...

53:41.916 --> 53:44.416
...you will make me suffer like
Sungurtekin did.

53:47.849 --> 53:49.449
If something like that happens...

53:51.349 --> 53:53.149
...you should know that you will cause
my death.

53:55.616 --> 53:56.616
Because...

54:02.682 --> 54:05.282
...I am not strong enough to lose
another son.

54:38.882 --> 54:39.882
Wait outside.

55:08.316 --> 55:09.349
Where is that cur Noyan?

55:10.849 --> 55:11.849
I do not know, Bey.

55:15.249 --> 55:16.682
Where is that cur called Noyan?

55:18.316 --> 55:19.316
I do not know, Bey.

55:26.916 --> 55:28.716
You are in his lodge for a long time.

55:30.149 --> 55:31.549
Do not you know anything about him?

55:33.116 --> 55:34.116
I do not know, Bey.

55:35.182 --> 55:36.382
The only thing I know is that...

55:37.616 --> 55:38.716
...I made a mistake.

55:41.349 --> 55:43.482
I only know that I want you to forgive me.

55:45.649 --> 55:49.116
Only God can forgive you.

55:49.649 --> 55:51.716
But I will not!

56:13.682 --> 56:14.849
What about Sungurtekin?

56:15.882 --> 56:17.349
Your brother Sungurtekin?

56:17.516 --> 56:19.682
Yes, my brother Sungurtekin!

56:25.616 --> 56:28.582
I know that Noyan hates him, Bey.

56:31.449 --> 56:32.782
I know that he used to trust him in the
past and...

56:34.482 --> 56:36.516
...helped him to raise with Ogeday...

56:41.916 --> 56:45.782
...and that later on, Sungurtekin became a
spy for Sultan Aleaddin.

56:48.249 --> 56:49.749
Then... Then...

56:52.749 --> 56:53.849
Then?

56:56.382 --> 56:57.516
Then...

56:59.849 --> 57:01.116
Then...

57:22.649 --> 57:23.649
Did he speak?

57:29.116 --> 57:30.516
Did you learn anything about Noyan?

57:33.249 --> 57:34.249
No.

57:40.749 --> 57:42.282
Who are you angry with, Gundogdu?

57:50.516 --> 57:52.616
You should know that, you became
a son to me.

57:56.416 --> 57:58.416
The world is not like it used to be
anymore, son.

58:01.282 --> 58:06.182
The only thing cowards will do is to move
to the lands far from trouble.

58:08.815 --> 58:11.516
But we do not have any other land
except this one.

58:15.149 --> 58:19.149
Hundreds of people from thousands of
tents depend on our words.

58:22.116 --> 58:24.282
It is our duty to make them live.

58:30.282 --> 58:34.815
For the sake of both nomad groups,
be careful about Ertugrul.

58:37.549 --> 58:39.516
It is uncertain wherever he goes,
whatever he does.

58:41.849 --> 58:43.582
Undoubtfully he is a great valiant.

58:45.882 --> 58:47.482
But If he stumbles one day...

58:49.782 --> 58:51.282
...we will all be swallowed.

59:18.582 --> 59:21.216
<i>It is time to go to Georgia</i>

59:21.582 --> 59:24.316
<i>Whoever wants to join, join now</i>

59:25.382 --> 59:27.882
<i>Manfuls join, not cravens</i>

59:33.282 --> 59:36.282
<i>Manfuls join, not cravens</i>

59:36.849 --> 59:40.282
<i>Manfuls join, not cravens</i>

59:42.182 --> 59:43.216
Dogan Alp.

59:52.449 --> 59:54.316
I am here to say May God be with you.

59:55.249 --> 59:57.249
You brought victory and honor
to our nomad group.

59:58.916 --> 59:59.916
Thank you.

01:00:00.649 --> 01:00:04.816
Whatever our Bey ordered, we tried to do
our best. That is all.

01:00:06.149 --> 01:00:08.882
Your bravery is far beyond
this, Dogan Alp.

01:00:10.416 --> 01:00:14.882
You are our prides. May God
let you have many more victories.

01:00:17.616 --> 01:00:18.616
Thank you.

01:00:22.516 --> 01:00:23.516
Excuse me.

01:00:41.516 --> 01:00:44.116
Does not the lover burn for the sweet one?

01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:47.216
Even If the sweet one started speaking.

01:00:48.749 --> 01:00:52.316
-How can the lion sleep anymore?
-Leave me alone.

01:00:54.649 --> 01:00:57.549
-Consider we are gone.
-Yes brother, let's say that we left.

01:00:58.216 --> 01:00:59.382
Not that we will go anywhere.

01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:03.149
Will the fire within fizzle out, brother?

01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:07.549
You are right.

01:01:09.516 --> 01:01:13.216
Her coming burns like bellow,
and her leaving is like coal.

01:01:17.782 --> 01:01:18.782
Good.

01:01:19.916 --> 01:01:21.782
Brother, finally you spoke.

01:01:22.482 --> 01:01:23.682
He spoke finally.

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:28.182
Brother, the laundry is done already.

01:01:28.782 --> 01:01:30.916
Make the meal as well. We are inside.

01:01:35.449 --> 01:01:37.549
Thankfully, brother. God bless you.

01:02:10.482 --> 01:02:11.549
<i>Do I have permission, Bey?</i>

01:02:11.716 --> 01:02:12.716
Come in!

01:02:18.682 --> 01:02:20.749
Sadettin Kobek sent you a letter, Bey.

01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:08.416
What is written in it, father?

01:04:16.649 --> 01:04:17.716
Sadettin Kobek says that...

01:04:18.749 --> 01:04:21.816
...all obstacles ahead of me being the
margrave are gone.

01:04:33.249 --> 01:04:34.382
Why are you like this, brother?

01:04:38.149 --> 01:04:40.216
The thing you wanted for years
is about to come true.

01:04:43.282 --> 01:04:48.516
But he also says that this will upset
all balances.

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:55.716
What does it mean?

01:04:58.349 --> 01:05:00.316
It means that everything is in danger.

01:05:04.749 --> 01:05:06.149
Is not there any solution?

01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:11.349
Yes. There is.

01:05:13.582 --> 01:05:15.782
Speak, brother. What is happening?

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:21.316
Solution is up to Sungurtekin.

01:05:22.916 --> 01:05:24.749
On the seal he carries with him.

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:31.349
Sadettin Kobek wants that seal from me.

01:05:35.282 --> 01:05:39.216
You were right when you said that Ertugrul
and Sungurtekin were after something.

01:05:40.216 --> 01:05:42.282
Eventually, it even effected us.

01:05:47.516 --> 01:05:48.749
What are we going to do then?

01:05:55.916 --> 01:05:57.482
Until we came this far...

01:05:59.382 --> 01:06:02.682
...we have destroyed many homes
and killed many men.

01:06:07.616 --> 01:06:09.782
Now we are on a road with a dead end.

01:06:13.249 --> 01:06:15.216
We will take this seal.

01:06:39.325 --> 01:06:40.992
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

01:07:11.892 --> 01:07:13.925
Hang on, brave man. Hang on.

01:07:29.359 --> 01:07:30.359
Mother...

01:07:32.825 --> 01:07:34.392
They are obviously cauterizing his wounds.

01:07:35.892 --> 01:07:38.025
It is over now. Do not worry.

01:07:41.292 --> 01:07:42.292
If God permits.

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.392
If God permits.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.925
It is over, brave man. It is over.

01:08:50.825 --> 01:08:57.059
We have been praying with your father for
years to see the three of you together.

01:09:03.459 --> 01:09:04.525
The day is today.

01:09:09.825 --> 01:09:13.225
Do not make me feel
the sorrow of separation again.

01:09:47.759 --> 01:09:49.092
How does he flip that?

01:10:16.425 --> 01:10:17.559
I hope nothing is wrong, sister?

01:10:22.292 --> 01:10:24.025
We have a favor to ask you, Dogan.

01:10:50.859 --> 01:10:52.159
I hope he gets better soon, Hayme Hatun.

01:10:52.792 --> 01:10:55.092
-I hope he gets better soon, Mother Hayme.
-I hope he gets better soon.

01:10:56.459 --> 01:11:00.292
Thank you. May God bless you

01:11:01.859 --> 01:11:03.259
and the healers.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:04.525
Thank  you.

01:11:05.359 --> 01:11:08.259
With God's help
Sungurtekin Bey is as fit as a fiddle.

01:11:08.759 --> 01:11:12.759
Those wounds are just like a wind for him.
Do not worry.

01:11:13.259 --> 01:11:16.192
–He will be alright in three days.
-If God permits.

01:11:16.392 --> 01:11:17.392
If God permits.

01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:21.192
Artuk Bey.

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:23.192
Thank you.

01:11:26.392 --> 01:11:27.425
Artuk Bey.

01:11:28.392 --> 01:11:30.259
-Yes, Bey.
-I would like to talk to you.

01:11:31.359 --> 01:11:34.159
If it is possible, I want to know
the situation of Abdurrahman Alp.

01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:36.459
Please.

01:11:47.225 --> 01:11:48.225
Come in, mother.

01:11:57.092 --> 01:11:59.959
They killed an old woman
and took the necklace.

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:01.925
And they are threatening me now.

01:12:02.825 --> 01:12:04.259
Why do you not tell this
to Gundogdu Bey?

01:12:04.792 --> 01:12:07.925
I cannot prove that I was telling the
truth without finding the necklace.

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:13.792
They will think that I lie because I do
not want him to marry another woman.

01:12:15.159 --> 01:12:16.459
I cannot make them believe me.

01:12:17.525 --> 01:12:18.525
I...

01:12:20.859 --> 01:12:22.359
...went into Gumustekin's marquee.

01:12:24.892 --> 01:12:26.492
I searched everywhere
but could not find the necklace.

01:12:28.092 --> 01:12:31.192
If I find the necklace,
I can prove that they are the killers.

01:12:35.959 --> 01:12:38.192
I need to go to Aytolun's marquee
and look for the necklace.

01:12:39.159 --> 01:12:41.325
I got a feeling
that the necklace is there.

01:12:47.392 --> 01:12:48.425
Okay, that is also understood.

01:12:50.058 --> 01:12:51.225
But what do you want from me?

01:12:56.392 --> 01:12:57.859
We want you to speak with Banu Cicek.

01:13:01.292 --> 01:13:02.292
What?

01:13:04.792 --> 01:13:07.192
Banu Cicek should find a way
to get me into the marquee.

01:13:39.325 --> 01:13:40.959
While there is life, there is hope, Bey.

01:13:41.892 --> 01:13:43.925
We will continue to pray every day.

01:13:51.792 --> 01:13:53.459
Even if the mountains
turn into a sea of blood

01:13:55.559 --> 01:13:57.992
Noyan will pay the price of
what he did, Artuk Bey.

01:13:59.192 --> 01:14:03.259
I will not doubt that even for a moment
while you are alive.

01:14:10.559 --> 01:14:11.792
Sungurtekin...

01:14:13.425 --> 01:14:14.925
...knows about the
white bearded, Artuk Bey.

01:14:18.025 --> 01:14:22.359
He asks our help to remove
the Oghuzs from Ogeday's army.

01:14:24.325 --> 01:14:26.159
How will Sungurtekin do that, Bey?

01:14:28.425 --> 01:14:29.792
With Oghuz Khan's seal.

01:14:34.092 --> 01:14:35.159
Does he have the seal?

01:14:36.759 --> 01:14:37.759
Yes.

01:14:42.025 --> 01:14:45.459
He wants to remind our brothers
in Ogeday's army who they are.

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:50.159
If he can do that

01:14:52.025 --> 01:14:55.792
if we can weaken Ogeday's army
before they enter Anatolia

01:14:58.392 --> 01:15:00.425
then we can save our state
without spilling blood, he says.

01:15:04.425 --> 01:15:05.792
I will do what is necessary, Bey.

01:15:12.292 --> 01:15:13.859
Tomorrow morning, I will go to Sogut.

01:15:15.925 --> 01:15:17.959
Lead the way for Sungurtekin
when he leaves.

01:15:19.559 --> 01:15:22.392
Every new road
will start a new resurrection, Bey.

01:15:23.925 --> 01:15:25.559
How will the fact that
you will be near Byzantine

01:15:26.225 --> 01:15:29.325
change your and your nomad tent's destiny?

01:15:32.959 --> 01:15:33.959
I also wonder that.

01:15:36.059 --> 01:15:37.492
I went to many places

01:15:39.092 --> 01:15:42.459
but I never got excited as much as now.

01:15:45.392 --> 01:15:48.759
May God always keep you
on the right way, Bey.

01:15:50.925 --> 01:15:51.925
Thank you.

01:15:55.059 --> 01:15:57.525
–My brother is entrusted to you.
-Of course, Bey.

01:16:29.825 --> 01:16:31.325
You wanted to see me, Efrasiyab?

01:16:31.925 --> 01:16:33.492
Are the goods of the rug house
still loaded?

01:16:34.225 --> 01:16:36.325
The camel train will leave
before it gets dark.

01:16:37.992 --> 01:16:41.492
Save the last one for the morning.
We will take someone with us.

01:17:12.792 --> 01:17:13.859
You wait outside.

01:17:26.025 --> 01:17:27.125
I made you my Alp.

01:17:28.559 --> 01:17:30.059
I entrusted you with my life.

01:17:31.792 --> 01:17:33.059
And what did you do, Hamza?

01:17:34.492 --> 01:17:35.825
You betrayed us.

01:17:37.959 --> 01:17:41.059
I will take your head tomorrow
in front of everybody.

01:17:47.425 --> 01:17:50.025
Whatever you do, you are right, Bey.

01:17:52.792 --> 01:17:54.292
But I have a last wish from you.

01:17:56.125 --> 01:17:57.525
Let my death serve you.

01:17:59.292 --> 01:18:02.892
The dog that is about to die
speaks like you, Hamza.

01:18:03.492 --> 01:18:06.125
Bey, listen to me.
What I will tell is very important.

01:18:08.325 --> 01:18:11.259
Shut up, infidel. Shut up.

01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:44.825
So, Mother Hayme wants to cheer
her table up with her children.

01:18:46.225 --> 01:18:47.225
Yes.

01:18:47.459 --> 01:18:50.525
Sons, daughters,
daughter–in–laws, son–in–laws...

01:18:55.759 --> 01:18:58.759
You cannot get a better chance
to get the seal.

01:19:00.092 --> 01:19:02.025
I will take that seal, aunt.

01:19:02.525 --> 01:19:04.025
Do not worry.

01:19:04.392 --> 01:19:07.492
I know very well what you are
capable of, Goncagul.

01:19:08.059 --> 01:19:09.492
I have no doubt about that.

01:19:21.259 --> 01:19:22.559
This ring is yours.

01:19:26.292 --> 01:19:27.359
Aunt...

01:19:30.125 --> 01:19:31.259
...this is very beautiful.

01:19:32.425 --> 01:19:36.759
It suits a woman like you
who is young and beautiful.

01:19:38.125 --> 01:19:39.825
Remember your aunt,
whenever you look at it.

01:20:15.825 --> 01:20:16.892
Mother...

01:20:17.492 --> 01:20:20.259
My brother Sungurtekin will come
to this table sooner or later.

01:20:23.225 --> 01:20:24.992
And look, you cooked his favorite meal
with meat and bulghur.

01:20:26.125 --> 01:20:27.459
Maybe he will feel the smell and come.

01:20:44.992 --> 01:20:46.025
I am sorry.

01:20:50.325 --> 01:20:51.525
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

01:20:57.925 --> 01:20:58.925
Son...

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.759
Is Selcan not coming?

01:21:12.425 --> 01:21:14.092
Do not forget the promise you gave me.

01:21:15.858 --> 01:21:17.225
Sleep in her tent tonight.

01:21:38.792 --> 01:21:39.892
Sungur?

01:21:43.492 --> 01:21:44.492
Good appetite.

01:22:16.092 --> 01:22:19.059
I said I would not leave without eating
the meal with meat and bulghur, mother.

01:22:38.392 --> 01:22:39.459
Sungur...

01:22:41.459 --> 01:22:46.492
This spoon has been waiting here
since the day you were captured.

01:22:50.892 --> 01:22:55.225
My mother never lost hope
even when we did.

01:22:58.492 --> 01:22:59.525
Mother...

01:23:01.859 --> 01:23:02.925
My dear mother.

01:23:16.559 --> 01:23:17.559
Sungurtekin Bey.

01:23:23.892 --> 01:23:25.459
I want to get to know everybody here.

01:23:27.459 --> 01:23:30.325
But I cannot see Sister Selcan, brother.

01:23:39.292 --> 01:23:40.359
Selcan is fine.

01:23:41.259 --> 01:23:43.392
But she will not be with us tonight.

01:23:45.092 --> 01:23:46.759
Let me introduce you my fiance.

01:23:47.892 --> 01:23:48.992
Goncagul Hatun.

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:51.525
My brother Sungurtekin.

01:24:30.125 --> 01:24:31.125
Come on, girl.

01:24:52.159 --> 01:24:53.492
Have a good night, Banu Cicek Hatun.

01:24:55.325 --> 01:24:56.359
You too, Dogan Alp.

01:24:59.792 --> 01:25:01.792
I could not sleep.
I was worried Karanfil would get cold.

01:25:03.125 --> 01:25:04.159
You thought well.

01:25:05.459 --> 01:25:06.825
Night frost is tough.

01:25:13.259 --> 01:25:14.325
She is a nimble mare.

01:25:16.925 --> 01:25:17.992
What is it?

01:25:18.859 --> 01:25:24.425
Korkut Bey and Aytolun Hatun
also told me that she was a nimble mare.

01:25:30.092 --> 01:25:32.092
-You like them, right?
-Yes.

01:25:32.759 --> 01:25:35.092
Especially, Korkut Bey.
He made a great effort for me.

01:25:37.859 --> 01:25:41.025
He made a great effort
for me and my sister.

01:25:44.259 --> 01:25:48.792
You would do anything for Korkut Bey
and the nomad group, do not you?

01:25:54.159 --> 01:25:55.359
Why did you come here, Dogan Alp?

01:25:58.259 --> 01:25:59.959
Did Selcan Hatun send you here?

01:26:09.892 --> 01:26:15.192
No one can ask me to betray
Bey and his wife.

01:26:16.559 --> 01:26:18.259
If I see you again

01:26:19.359 --> 01:26:22.125
I swear to God, I go and tell
everything to Bey.

01:26:25.059 --> 01:26:26.125
Do you understand me?

01:26:29.892 --> 01:26:33.159
As he said, if there is such a bad luck
in the nomad tent

01:26:34.092 --> 01:26:36.559
the resolution of this issue comes
before everything, Banu Cicek.

01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:41.059
It is your duty for Korkut Bey.

01:26:41.292 --> 01:26:44.492
Dogan Alp, if you say another word...

01:26:58.525 --> 01:27:00.025
Halime Sultan sent her greetings too.

01:27:01.459 --> 01:27:03.825
She wanted you to find the necklace
of Selcan Hatun in the marquee.

01:27:05.892 --> 01:27:07.992
You do what is necessary if you find
the necklace in the marquee

01:27:09.292 --> 01:27:10.392
as Selcan Hatun said.

01:27:12.559 --> 01:27:13.892
I said what I had to say.

01:27:16.825 --> 01:27:18.092
Do not kill the messenger.

01:27:22.892 --> 01:27:23.959
Sorry for that.

01:27:37.892 --> 01:27:41.392
I thought
Mongolians did not take prisoners.

01:27:42.292 --> 01:27:46.259
How did they take you
prisoner, Sungurtekin Bey?

01:27:57.192 --> 01:27:59.425
Because I was very good with the horses.

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:05.159
I took care of the horses
of the family of Genghis Khan for years.

01:28:10.059 --> 01:28:11.192
So, is that all?

01:28:24.859 --> 01:28:27.125
It is not just that, of course.

01:28:28.092 --> 01:28:31.159
If somebody would harm
even a hair on the horses' head

01:28:31.225 --> 01:28:33.125
they would kill me.

01:28:37.092 --> 01:28:40.959
Thank God, you left those hard days behind
and returned to us, brother.

01:28:43.359 --> 01:28:45.159
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

01:28:45.759 --> 01:28:47.159
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

01:28:55.492 --> 01:28:58.559
We eat my mother's meal together

01:29:02.059 --> 01:29:04.792
with our loved ones in our nomad tent.

01:29:06.559 --> 01:29:08.292
What more can we ask for?

01:29:22.825 --> 01:29:25.459
I wish your father was here
and saw that.

01:29:33.192 --> 01:29:35.825
This is God's will, mother.

01:30:35.125 --> 01:30:37.192
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, Bey.

01:30:39.759 --> 01:30:40.859
Still the same, Bey.

01:30:45.359 --> 01:30:48.192
He went there knowing what Noyan will do.

01:30:49.092 --> 01:30:51.259
-He sacrificed himself for us.
-Wait now.

01:30:51.925 --> 01:30:53.892
Abdurrahman will wake up.

01:30:55.825 --> 01:30:59.492
Neither we nor he has the right
to give up.

01:31:03.492 --> 01:31:04.492
Bey.

01:31:06.559 --> 01:31:08.392
Turali is entrusted to me now.

01:31:11.492 --> 01:31:17.825
I will raise him as a brave Alp
like Abdurrahman, with God's help.

01:31:20.425 --> 01:31:23.059
Turali proved us how a brave Alp
he will be, Wild Demir.

01:31:24.925 --> 01:31:27.392
There is no doubt about it.

01:31:28.792 --> 01:31:29.892
If you excuse us, Bey.

01:31:32.959 --> 01:31:33.959
Come on.

01:31:53.859 --> 01:31:54.859
Alps!

01:31:57.492 --> 01:31:58.759
Prepare yourselves.

01:32:00.059 --> 01:32:01.559
We will set off with the sunrise.

01:32:06.259 --> 01:32:07.259
Where are we going, Bey?

01:32:08.459 --> 01:32:10.459
To the lands where our destiny
will be determined, Turgut.

01:32:45.892 --> 01:32:46.925
Selcan Hatun?

01:32:48.425 --> 01:32:50.092
If you excuse me
I have something to tell you.

01:32:58.392 --> 01:32:59.959
What is it at this hour, trader?

01:33:00.859 --> 01:33:03.159
We have seen some flaws
with the carpets

01:33:03.325 --> 01:33:04.792
when we were loading them
in the rug house.

01:33:05.325 --> 01:33:07.792
What kind of flaws?
I checked them one by one.

01:33:09.325 --> 01:33:12.459
Then I should tell that to Aytolun Hatun.
Sorry, I disturbed you.

01:33:13.859 --> 01:33:14.859
Wait.

01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:19.225
You go to the rug house,
I will come there soon.

01:33:20.959 --> 01:33:22.125
I am waiting for you, sister.

01:33:23.992 --> 01:33:25.125
I will wait next to the car.

01:33:44.525 --> 01:33:45.525
Gundogdu Bey?

01:33:58.259 --> 01:33:59.259
Gundogdu Bey.

01:34:01.525 --> 01:34:04.825
You looked like you were worried.
It bothers me.

01:34:05.992 --> 01:34:09.025
I asked for permission from my father
and came to talk to you.

01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:13.192
I would like to talk to you, if you wish.

01:34:13.892 --> 01:34:16.059
It is cold, do not get cold.

01:34:18.259 --> 01:34:22.225
When I am with you,
every winter is like spring, Bey.

01:34:25.325 --> 01:34:28.525
My problem is my nomad tent,
my Alps, Goncagul Hatun.

01:34:30.292 --> 01:34:31.325
Is not that enough?

01:34:35.525 --> 01:34:41.992
My problem is to not show you any other
troubles until my life is over.

01:34:48.292 --> 01:34:49.392
Shall we take a walk?

01:35:28.892 --> 01:35:29.959
Mister Trader?

01:35:32.525 --> 01:35:33.759
Mister Trader?

01:35:40.059 --> 01:35:41.192
Mister Trader?

01:35:42.092 --> 01:35:43.192
Mister Trader?

01:37:39.325 --> 01:37:42.092
I saw you were looking at
Selcan Hatun's marquee.

01:37:43.759 --> 01:37:48.392
Is she your trouble that you could not
tell me about while we were walking?

01:37:53.192 --> 01:37:58.059
My pain started the first day
I came to the nomad tent.

01:38:01.359 --> 01:38:04.092
You were an unimaginable
dream for me, Gundogdu Bey.

01:38:05.559 --> 01:38:07.292
You were Suleyman Shah's son.

01:38:08.092 --> 01:38:10.025
You were married to his adopted daughter.

01:38:13.825 --> 01:38:18.492
Do you know how much I struggled
to rip you off my heart?

01:38:21.759 --> 01:38:23.792
That day you came and asked my hand
from my father

01:38:25.259 --> 01:38:26.958
and now I do not care anything.

01:38:30.025 --> 01:38:34.492
Neither Selcan Hatun remaining your wife
nor anything else.

01:38:37.125 --> 01:38:38.192
What about now?

01:38:39.392 --> 01:38:40.958
My heart is broken, Bey.

01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:46.159
Since I saw you in front of her marquee...

01:38:51.559 --> 01:38:52.759
I am sorry.

01:38:54.159 --> 01:38:55.392
I crossed the line, again.

01:38:59.359 --> 01:39:00.559
One who loves, gets jealous.

01:39:01.492 --> 01:39:03.992
I am sorry, Bey. Have a good night.

01:39:04.792 --> 01:39:05.892
Goncagul Hatun.

01:39:07.892 --> 01:39:09.292
Do not forget my words.

01:39:13.492 --> 01:39:18.092
Selcan Hatun promised that
she will be my wife until her death.

01:39:22.192 --> 01:39:23.925
And I promised to be her man.

01:39:26.459 --> 01:39:27.492
I know that.

01:39:29.859 --> 01:39:30.892
And I know you are right.

01:39:35.492 --> 01:39:39.259
It is just foolishness of a young girl.

01:39:40.925 --> 01:39:42.025
I am sorry.

01:39:55.025 --> 01:39:56.092
Have a good night.

01:40:24.759 --> 01:40:28.025
I have been dreaming of this day
for years.

01:40:28.392 --> 01:40:32.959
Sitting with my family in the
same table and same marquee.

01:40:34.859 --> 01:40:36.192
I do not bother if I die now.

01:40:42.525 --> 01:40:43.859
Get some rest.

01:40:45.992 --> 01:40:47.892
We have so many things to talk about, son.

01:40:50.459 --> 01:40:51.992
You returned to your nomad group.

01:40:56.492 --> 01:40:57.759
Mother?

01:41:00.225 --> 01:41:01.759
I want to set off in the morning.

01:41:11.792 --> 01:41:12.825
Set off?

01:41:16.892 --> 01:41:18.092
Where will you go?

01:41:19.459 --> 01:41:20.892
You just came, son.

01:41:22.559 --> 01:41:24.059
Besides, in this situation...

01:41:27.759 --> 01:41:28.892
I need to go, mother.

01:41:39.059 --> 01:41:42.359
Will you also seal your lips

01:41:44.492 --> 01:41:47.959
against us like Ertugrul?

01:41:55.125 --> 01:41:56.492
Secrets covered secrets, mother.

01:42:00.292 --> 01:42:03.525
Every covered secret is a new pain.

01:42:05.525 --> 01:42:09.425
And new pains are the
messengers of new secrets.

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:16.292
Which secret of mine
would be an ointment for your wound?

01:42:21.259 --> 01:42:24.459
It will be salt for your wound.
Not an ointment.

01:42:27.025 --> 01:42:28.359
Do not do this to me, mother.

01:42:30.192 --> 01:42:31.525
Let me keep my secrets as secrets.

01:42:33.192 --> 01:42:34.459
Just leave them with me.

01:42:42.159 --> 01:42:43.225
You should know that

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:48.359
I did not dishonor my father
or my ancestor Oghuz.

01:42:51.159 --> 01:42:54.259
Know that and pray for me, mother.

01:43:01.825 --> 01:43:03.125
Get some rest now.

01:43:43.059 --> 01:43:44.159
Give me your blessing, mother.

01:43:45.825 --> 01:43:47.259
I hope I will return with good news.

01:43:54.359 --> 01:43:56.459
May God speed you...

01:43:59.392 --> 01:44:01.159
...on the way with Sungur.

01:44:02.392 --> 01:44:03.925
You have my blessing.

01:44:05.392 --> 01:44:07.992
Go fast, and come back fast.

01:44:09.325 --> 01:44:13.192
You should know that, our way is
the way of fire and love, mother.

01:44:15.125 --> 01:44:18.892
We are the slaves who want
to serve on this way.

01:44:21.825 --> 01:44:23.092
Beyond that is illicit to us.

01:44:24.892 --> 01:44:26.059
Give me your blessing.

01:44:29.859 --> 01:44:30.925
May God be with you.

01:44:32.959 --> 01:44:34.359
May God be with you, too.

01:46:01.559 --> 01:46:02.792
Did you get it?

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:05.892
I got it, father.

01:46:45.025 --> 01:46:46.959
We went in with Gokce at dinner.

01:46:48.292 --> 01:46:49.325
I took the seal.

01:46:58.125 --> 01:46:59.159
<i>Look.</i>

01:47:02.825 --> 01:47:04.292
<i>-Very beautiful.</i>
 <i>-Yes.</i>

01:47:06.892 --> 01:47:08.759
<i>Efrasiyab brought this from Tabriz.</i>

01:47:10.892 --> 01:47:13.159
<i>-This is even better.</i>
 <i>-Yes, it is very beautiful.</i>

01:47:14.792 --> 01:47:17.059
<i>There are too many things.</i>
 <i>Look what I will show you.</i>

01:47:17.892 --> 01:47:18.992
<i>I am coming right away.</i>

01:47:20.392 --> 01:47:21.392
<i>Okay.</i>

01:47:42.059 --> 01:47:44.025
It is time for being the margrave now.

01:47:45.492 --> 01:47:47.392
There is no turning back.

01:47:48.059 --> 01:47:49.792
May God let you succeed, brother.

01:47:51.892 --> 01:47:55.092
But what is this seal?

01:47:56.292 --> 01:47:57.992
It is the seal of Oghuz Khan, Aytolun.

01:48:02.325 --> 01:48:03.492
What are you saying, father?

01:48:04.492 --> 01:48:06.059
Will you give this seal

01:48:06.225 --> 01:48:09.759
that all khans and sultans sought after
to Sadettin Kobek?

01:48:10.559 --> 01:48:13.792
Everything has a price, daughter.

01:48:16.025 --> 01:48:17.125
I paid the price.

01:48:22.192 --> 01:48:24.092
Now it is Sadettin Kobek's turn.

01:49:08.385 --> 01:49:09.385
Brother.

01:49:12.952 --> 01:49:15.852
Since he is going to leave,
Dogan lost his mind completely.

01:49:20.019 --> 01:49:25.252
As he will not be able to see Banu Cicek,
he's like hit by a ton of bricks.

01:49:29.519 --> 01:49:32.519
I hope that you will also burn in
the fire of love one day, Bamsi.

01:49:33.919 --> 01:49:37.719
You burn and understand
how cruel the world is.

01:49:37.952 --> 01:49:39.952
Repentance, brother, repentance.

01:49:40.452 --> 01:49:44.319
Did you lose your senses? Repentance.

01:49:45.985 --> 01:49:47.219
Repentance.

01:49:49.219 --> 01:49:52.152
Brother, you speak
as you do not know.

01:49:53.885 --> 01:49:57.819
I am married to my sword. I
like my horse like my child.

01:49:58.985 --> 01:50:00.819
If Bey orders me to die, I will.

01:50:01.852 --> 01:50:05.452
I fight until an arrow lost its way,
a spear that is out of its range...

01:50:05.919 --> 01:50:10.185
...says "stop brother,
your life ends here.”

01:50:13.219 --> 01:50:17.419
Every fight of ours is our
bridal chamber, thank God.

01:50:18.052 --> 01:50:19.519
Thank you, brother.

01:50:34.219 --> 01:50:36.252
Tomorrow is the time to go, brother.

01:50:38.719 --> 01:50:40.485
Let us see what kind of
fights are waiting for us.

01:50:41.219 --> 01:50:42.319
Yes, brother.

01:50:43.385 --> 01:50:45.319
Let us see what kind of
fights are waiting for us.

01:50:46.085 --> 01:50:48.919
What is love? It is
word of wild human.

01:50:55.485 --> 01:51:00.019
Brother, you know that I
keep Aykiz sister out of it.

01:51:01.052 --> 01:51:03.252
I know.

01:51:08.752 --> 01:51:10.185
Let us sleep, brother.

01:51:18.319 --> 01:51:20.419
Thank God, we have Ertugrul Bey...

01:51:24.052 --> 01:51:28.852
...and we do not have time
to think about our sufferings.

01:51:31.352 --> 01:51:32.852
Did you say something, brother?

01:51:34.819 --> 01:51:36.052
Have a good night.

01:51:38.252 --> 01:51:40.252
You too, brother, you too.

01:52:02.752 --> 01:52:04.385
Everything happened as Noyan wanted.

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:08.019
If God permits.

01:52:19.085 --> 01:52:21.019
Calm down. It is me.

01:52:22.385 --> 01:52:23.852
What are you doing here?

01:52:27.452 --> 01:52:29.885
Noyan will never
leave a valiant behind.

01:52:31.819 --> 01:52:35.519
So you find a way to get
me out of this nomad tent.

01:52:36.452 --> 01:52:39.885
You find it, so I and Noyan
will always be grateful to you.

01:52:42.352 --> 01:52:45.119
They do not understand that I
run away until the guards' shift.

01:52:46.019 --> 01:52:48.152
You find a way to get
me out of nomad tent.

01:52:54.919 --> 01:52:55.985
Welcome.

01:53:01.452 --> 01:53:02.952
Welcome, brother.

01:53:07.185 --> 01:53:11.452
Noyan wanted you to be with him and
what he wanted has just happened.

01:53:38.452 --> 01:53:40.519
May God speed you, Ertugrul.

01:53:46.252 --> 01:53:47.252
Amen.

01:55:12.185 --> 01:55:14.985
May God speed you wherever you go.

01:55:15.719 --> 01:55:19.085
I hope you go and come back quickly
and be back with your loved ones.

01:55:22.019 --> 01:55:23.985
I do not want you to resent, brother.

01:55:24.419 --> 01:55:26.852
I will explain you everything
as soon as I come back.

01:55:26.985 --> 01:55:29.085
I hope so, brother, I hope so.

01:57:31.119 --> 01:57:32.285
We are ready, Bey.

01:57:43.019 --> 01:57:45.119
Stop.

01:58:02.385 --> 01:58:04.119
Give your blessing, Bey.

01:58:05.152 --> 01:58:07.719
If fate so decrees, we will do
business again, if God permits.

01:58:09.119 --> 01:58:12.752
If God permits, trader. We will
do greater business together.

01:58:13.985 --> 01:58:16.485
If there are honest Turks
who do business like you...

01:58:17.119 --> 01:58:19.085
...everybody get the best of it, Bey.

01:58:48.319 --> 01:58:49.452
Do not forgive me.

01:58:50.019 --> 01:58:53.352
But do not pollute the land with
my worthless blood, as you said.

01:58:54.085 --> 01:58:56.752
Let me take Abdurrahman's revenge.

01:58:57.385 --> 01:59:01.419
How can I trust you after you
betrayed me and your brothers...

01:59:01.752 --> 01:59:03.319
...so many times, Hamza?

01:59:04.085 --> 01:59:06.319
I want to bring Noyan's
head to you, Bey.

01:59:07.519 --> 01:59:11.419
If I die doing this, my blood
will be my offering for you and the land.

01:59:12.252 --> 01:59:14.085
But I can give you more.

01:59:15.052 --> 01:59:16.952
There is another traitor
in this nomad group, Bey.

01:59:17.352 --> 01:59:20.452
I do not know why he came
here and what he is after.

01:59:21.152 --> 01:59:24.519
But be sure that he will be the  one
who will take you and me to Noyan.

01:59:29.485 --> 01:59:32.185
-Who is this?
-Trader Efrasiyab.

01:59:33.485 --> 01:59:37.152
Till now, he brought
so much information...

01:59:38.519 --> 01:59:41.519
...and so he hurt you
and the nomad tent.

01:59:43.085 --> 01:59:45.719
If you want, catch him and
his men and make them talk.

01:59:46.019 --> 01:59:47.352
You will see that I am right.

01:59:49.352 --> 01:59:53.385
Whatever you decide,
I'm ready to die for it, my Bey.

01:59:54.319 --> 01:59:55.452
Give your blessing.

01:59:59.285 --> 02:00:05.252
Hamza, if what you said is a lie
I will not wait until tomorrow...

02:00:05.385 --> 02:00:08.485
...and will take your head
here. Just you know that.

02:00:09.419 --> 02:00:11.252
All I said is true, Bey.

02:00:26.852 --> 02:00:30.252
I will get you out
of this tent tonight.

02:00:32.485 --> 02:00:34.819
You will go to Efrasiyab right away.

02:00:35.152 --> 02:00:37.819
You will finish the job that
Abdurrahman has left unfinished.

02:00:38.385 --> 02:00:40.352
-Did you understand that?
-I understood, Bey.

02:00:41.852 --> 02:00:42.985
Go away!

02:00:45.019 --> 02:00:46.885
I am with you until
my last breathe, Bey.

02:00:48.519 --> 02:00:50.119
God bless you.

02:01:40.352 --> 02:01:41.752
Have a good journey.

02:01:42.885 --> 02:01:44.052
Thank you, Bey.
