00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 57 will start after 12:22 min.

12:22.192 --> 12:26.192
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:52.360 --> 12:54.093
Tugtekin Bey!

13:07.060 --> 13:08.193
Tugtekin!

13:09.427 --> 13:10.660
Tugtekin, brother!

13:11.360 --> 13:13.360
I will make him regret he did not kill me.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.327
Tugtekin!

13:15.393 --> 13:17.160
Tugtekin!

13:20.160 --> 13:23.760
How can I be calm when
he has Gokce, Ertugrul? Let me go.

13:24.260 --> 13:25.927
-Tugtekin!
-Let me go!

13:43.060 --> 13:44.727
It has been a plenteous hunt.

13:46.027 --> 13:47.960
Your sons are with my servants in my den.

13:48.960 --> 13:53.860
And since you came to my feet,
then I should play with you.

13:57.893 --> 14:00.893
First Selcan, now Gokce.

14:05.027 --> 14:07.193
You are only strong enough for women.

14:07.827 --> 14:09.827
You will leave here as a carrion.

14:10.827 --> 14:11.927
You bastard dog!

14:12.927 --> 14:14.893
Do not, Selcan!

14:14.960 --> 14:17.960
Kayi women are better than their men.

14:18.027 --> 14:21.060
Everyone I wanted to see
is here except Ertugrul.

14:22.293 --> 14:23.893
What more could I wish?

14:23.960 --> 14:28.093
Dying before seeing your death
is a sin for us, Noyan.

14:32.693 --> 14:37.827
A sturdy arm is more valuable than
inane courage in war, Maimed Boy.

14:37.893 --> 14:40.660
Your maimed arm will cost you
your life, you do not see.

14:41.727 --> 14:43.360
Be careful, mother.

14:50.827 --> 14:53.327
Come here, dog's seed. Come.

16:04.927 --> 16:06.127
It is not over.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.993
Maimed Boy.

16:20.160 --> 16:23.227
I see your arm made
your life miserable, Maimed Boy.

16:23.893 --> 16:25.193
I cannot accept it.

16:26.060 --> 16:27.993
I shall save you from this misery.

16:31.793 --> 16:33.127
Gundogdu!

17:08.793 --> 17:10.360
God!

17:14.193 --> 17:16.660
Gundogdu, are you fine?

17:16.727 --> 17:18.627
We will meet again.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.760
Gokce!

17:26.327 --> 17:27.927
Mother!

17:27.993 --> 17:28.993
Son!

17:30.427 --> 17:31.727
Son.

17:35.093 --> 17:36.893
-Mother!
-Dundar.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.793
We are fine, son. Leave us,
go after that Noyan bastard. Haste!

17:40.860 --> 17:42.427
Come on!

17:49.060 --> 17:50.093
Daughter.

18:38.427 --> 18:39.693
They went this way, Bey.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.027
Ride!

19:10.007 --> 19:12.007
-I will rip his heart out!
-Tugtekin Bey!

19:16.374 --> 19:18.207
Tugtekin Bey, do not worry.

19:18.874 --> 19:20.907
We will catch him sooner or later.

19:20.974 --> 19:24.174
I will pluck his heart out.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.807
Do not worry. We will save her.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.574
I will put his heart on his hand.

19:30.874 --> 19:33.240
Alps! Follow Tugtekin Bey!

19:36.574 --> 19:39.640
Do not leave Tugtekin alone
until he reaches to nomad tent.

19:39.707 --> 19:41.240
Are you not coming with us?

19:41.307 --> 19:44.207
No. I will not return
until I find Noyan and Yigit.

19:44.274 --> 19:45.840
This must be over quickly.

19:46.674 --> 19:48.940
-May God help you.
-Thank you.

20:04.574 --> 20:09.007
If you find Yigit, bring him to
the nomad tent alive, brother.

20:09.074 --> 20:12.607
We shall surrender him to Sultan Alaeddin.
Let him give his punishment.

20:13.574 --> 20:15.007
Be under God's watch.

20:23.074 --> 20:26.040
<i>Ertugrul, do not silence</i>
 <i>your justice when it comes to Yigit.</i>

20:26.107 --> 20:28.140
<i>If he revolted, he will die.</i>

20:46.840 --> 20:51.107
Tomorrow will be the day
of your victory, his Ameer.

21:02.740 --> 21:07.607
Shahzada Yigit will die along
with revolter Turkmen Beys.

21:10.207 --> 21:16.774
And both Ertugrul and Tugtekin
will have their share of my rage.

21:25.307 --> 21:29.307
I will be personally in command
in the battle tomorrow, if God permits.

21:33.074 --> 21:35.374
Tomorrow will be a blessed day...

21:35.607 --> 21:38.340
...that the ones who does not
submit to me will perish.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.374
Order, my dear child.

21:49.107 --> 21:50.140
Order.

21:51.640 --> 21:55.207
The order of this state is above everyone.

21:56.074 --> 21:58.174
Even our sultan.

21:59.974 --> 22:02.007
And even myself.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.807
What will Sungurtekin's
and Gundogdu's fate be, his Ameer?

22:10.207 --> 22:15.607
They will do anything
for their nomad tent's future.

22:18.174 --> 22:20.974
I have plans for Kayi Tribe.

22:22.674 --> 22:27.707
It is time a new hero emerges from them.

22:28.707 --> 22:32.874
And this hero's leash will be in my palms.

22:35.807 --> 22:37.840
How will that happen, his Ameer?

22:38.340 --> 22:40.674
What I actually wonder is,
who will that be?

22:42.807 --> 22:44.140
Sungurtekin.

22:46.007 --> 22:52.274
Sungurtekin will be a hero when he kills
Noyan and saves Gokce Hatun, thanks to me.

22:53.774 --> 22:56.774
Watch the clutter then.

22:59.107 --> 23:00.940
We will wait and see, my child.

23:05.007 --> 23:11.207
Long live, Sultan!

23:11.274 --> 23:15.340
Long live, Sultan!

23:15.574 --> 23:21.607
Long live, Sultan!

23:21.674 --> 23:27.074
Long live, Sultan!

23:27.140 --> 23:32.974
Long live, Sultan!

23:33.607 --> 23:39.607
Long live, Sultan!

23:39.674 --> 23:45.007
Long live, Sultan!

23:45.074 --> 23:51.007
Long live, Sultan!

23:51.074 --> 23:56.740
Long live, Sultan!

23:56.807 --> 24:03.674
Long live, Sultan!

24:06.307 --> 24:07.907
My Beys.

24:07.974 --> 24:10.874
You have took the brunt
for all the troubles of state.

24:10.940 --> 24:13.807
You fought first against the enemy.

24:13.874 --> 24:16.007
You died for your state.

24:16.074 --> 24:18.140
You suffered
the grief of losing your child.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.740
When need be, you left your home.

24:21.807 --> 24:24.907
You were left
without grassland, summer pasture.

24:24.974 --> 24:28.674
Where was Sultan Alaeddin
when you were suffering these pains?

24:30.074 --> 24:35.007
Now I ask you,
would a Sultan ignore his subjects?

24:35.074 --> 24:36.674
No!

24:36.740 --> 24:40.607
Would a Sultan enjoy himself
while his people are suffering?

24:40.674 --> 24:41.807
No!

24:42.774 --> 24:45.940
Is it not the time to take
what is rightfully yours now?

24:46.007 --> 24:47.007
Yes!

24:47.240 --> 24:50.174
Has the time not come to subject
for a Sultan worthy of you?

24:50.240 --> 24:52.107
Yes!

24:52.174 --> 24:54.840
Now it is time to take what you deserve.

24:55.340 --> 24:57.140
That is why I came.

24:57.207 --> 25:01.574
I came to show you
the state's justice and benignity.

25:02.040 --> 25:08.140
Long live, Sultan!

25:08.207 --> 25:14.907
Long live, Sultan!

25:14.974 --> 25:20.774
Long live, Sultan!

25:21.240 --> 25:26.640
Long live, Sultan!

25:26.707 --> 25:32.107
Long live, Sultan!

25:33.307 --> 25:39.840
Long live, Sultan!

25:39.907 --> 25:46.207
Long live, Sultan!

25:46.807 --> 25:52.874
Long live, Sultan!

25:53.707 --> 25:59.740
Long live, Sultan!

25:59.807 --> 26:05.640
Long live, Sultan!

26:06.274 --> 26:11.640
Long live, Sultan!

26:12.607 --> 26:15.674
Long live, Sultan!

26:20.974 --> 26:26.874
Long live, Sultan!

26:26.940 --> 26:30.640
Long live, Sultan!

26:32.907 --> 26:36.274
What will be my fate, his Ameer?

26:44.074 --> 26:45.807
Do not worry, child.

26:47.007 --> 26:51.940
After you take your revenge, you will
have the reward for the things you did.

26:53.207 --> 26:56.807
You very much deserved
a noble and magnificent life.

26:57.974 --> 27:00.374
I will take you to palace, by my side.

27:02.574 --> 27:05.174
I will marry you to one of
my most worthful commanders.

27:05.940 --> 27:09.340
Thus, you can continue
to serve me and the state.

27:11.007 --> 27:15.274
When we avenge my aunt
and my father, this earth...

27:15.340 --> 27:18.740
...will be heaven for me, his Ameer.

27:19.174 --> 27:22.607
I will not forget
your favors for me all my life.

27:29.974 --> 27:32.607
Noyan shall not know you came here.

27:33.040 --> 27:38.174
Do not forget,
when Noyan takes off to kill Tugtekin...

27:39.307 --> 27:42.840
...you will leave Gokce there
and leave immediately.

27:45.674 --> 27:46.674
Now, leave.

28:35.207 --> 28:38.774
<i>If you allow me, I would like to kiss</i>
 <i>your hand and ask for your blessing.</i>

28:39.340 --> 28:40.974
<i>My dear sister.</i>

28:42.640 --> 28:45.574
On this happy day of mine
when I enter my man's tent...

28:45.640 --> 28:48.007
<i>...I wish to enter</i>
 <i>with your benison, sister.</i>

28:48.074 --> 28:51.774
<i>My prayers will always</i>
 <i>be with you and your man.</i>

28:53.240 --> 28:59.240
<i>You are a piece of my soul.</i>
 <i>Your sister will always be with you...</i>

29:01.740 --> 29:04.940
<i>...the same way you will be by</i>
 <i>your husband's side for a life time.</i>

29:12.740 --> 29:16.974
The clouds that came between her
and Tugtekin Bey were lifting one by one.

29:19.774 --> 29:22.007
The sun was about
to rise on their marquee.

29:24.907 --> 29:28.307
Maybe my Gokce was
this happy for the first time in her life.

29:30.340 --> 29:32.940
That bastard came and took my sister.

29:58.874 --> 30:00.174
He vanished without a trace.

30:00.240 --> 30:04.307
Gokce is gone. My sister is gone.

30:09.774 --> 30:12.340
Noyan knew we were
going to raid his nomad tent.

30:13.307 --> 30:14.907
He played with us.

30:16.340 --> 30:19.140
He watched the Beys
leave the nomad tent for raid.

30:22.707 --> 30:24.674
Then he abducted my child, Gokce.

30:25.207 --> 30:27.140
They must have set a trap for Ertugrul.

30:39.674 --> 30:43.040
We sent our brave men
to Noyan's trap with our own hands.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.174
Then we need to take off
after our men at once, brother.

30:50.240 --> 30:54.040
God, you protect our brave men.

30:54.107 --> 30:56.374
Let them return to the nomad tent safely.

30:57.307 --> 30:58.607
What will happen now?

30:59.574 --> 31:01.340
Will we stand idle with our hands tied?

31:04.240 --> 31:07.307
You keep your wits
about you first, brother.

31:11.074 --> 31:13.940
Ertugrul will surely figure something out.

31:16.707 --> 31:17.974
The real matter is...

31:20.374 --> 31:23.074
...why Noyan wanted to abduct Gokce Hatun.

32:07.674 --> 32:08.974
Goncagul Hatun!

32:11.974 --> 32:13.340
Goncagul Hatun!

32:16.907 --> 32:18.274
Hatun!

32:19.707 --> 32:21.340
Noyan!

32:26.040 --> 32:27.940
I'm here.

32:28.007 --> 32:29.340
You!

32:32.207 --> 32:33.907
I will kill you!

32:44.574 --> 32:48.774
So you entrapped
the wife of Dodurga, Noyan.

32:51.807 --> 32:53.107
Come here.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.774
Stop.

33:02.674 --> 33:05.907
So you are Noyan's woman now, huh?

33:06.574 --> 33:08.040
Sordid woman.

33:08.107 --> 33:09.707
I will kill you!

33:25.840 --> 33:27.107
Enough!

33:30.240 --> 33:31.974
Enough!

33:32.640 --> 33:34.240
Be patient yet.

33:35.274 --> 33:37.640
Do not forget, she will bring us Tugtekin.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.640
No. No!

33:52.174 --> 33:53.173
Noyan.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.340
You are wounded.

33:56.574 --> 33:58.074
Flare up the fire.

33:59.040 --> 34:02.007
Ertugrul's brother Dundar
shot the arrow stalwartly.

35:10.874 --> 35:12.340
What is the situation?

35:12.574 --> 35:14.140
Could you find Yigit Bey?

35:16.374 --> 35:18.907
We could not find Yigit, Banu Cicek Hatun.

35:18.974 --> 35:21.674
And Turgut Alp? Where is he?

35:23.207 --> 35:26.240
Turgut Brother is in Noyan's hands, too.

35:49.740 --> 35:51.940
Where is Gokce Hatun, Mother Hayme?

35:58.240 --> 36:00.907
Tell me that Gokche Hatun
is in the nomad tent.

36:21.107 --> 36:22.374
Noyan...

36:24.174 --> 36:27.174
...kidnapped Gokce Hatun, Tugtekin Bey.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.074
What do you mean he kidnapped her?

36:37.307 --> 36:41.740
Could not one man come out and
tell him to stop in this huge nomad tent?

36:43.607 --> 36:47.607
Could he not die to stop it while a
Bey's wife was being kidnapped?

36:47.674 --> 36:49.140
What do you mean "kidnapped"?

36:55.007 --> 36:56.007
Tugtekin Bey.

36:59.240 --> 37:02.807
We were near the graveyard, too.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.707
But, forgive us, we could not stop it.

37:11.140 --> 37:12.674
Were you trapped, too?

37:13.307 --> 37:15.774
What was Gokce doing
in the graveyard, brother?

37:16.674 --> 37:19.574
It seems someone
sent her there on purpose.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.040
I will find that traitor.

37:26.207 --> 37:30.607
I will tear his flesh from limb to limb
in the middle of the nomad tent.

37:31.940 --> 37:34.840
I will feed his bones to hungry wolves.

37:38.107 --> 37:39.607
Tugtekin Bey.

37:42.374 --> 37:43.640
You should know...

37:44.274 --> 37:47.074
...his deal is with you,
not with Gokce Hatun.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.007
He will not kill her.

37:50.740 --> 37:53.040
He wants to pull you
into a trap, Tugtekin Bey.

38:37.874 --> 38:41.974
You dulled my pains by bringing this
ignoble woman to me, Noyan.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.640
Your eyes make Noyan's heart rest.

38:52.774 --> 38:55.374
It makes the gallant horses
inside him neigh.

39:30.874 --> 39:32.807
You ignoble woman!

39:35.240 --> 39:38.940
You will die like them,
Gokce Hatun, you know it, do you not?

39:41.307 --> 39:43.307
Enough!

39:44.707 --> 39:46.674
Goncagul Hatun, enough.

40:23.574 --> 40:25.574
I know your anger, Goncagul Hatun.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.640
However, Gokce is not
who we want. She is only a bait.

40:31.174 --> 40:34.374
Ertugrul and Tugtekin are the ones
who took your beloveds from you.

40:36.340 --> 40:40.074
Do not succumb
to your anger and ruin everything.

40:41.840 --> 40:45.674
I know, Noyan. Do not worry.
I will keep my anger inside me.

40:47.207 --> 40:49.874
Tomorrow, both Ertugrul
and Tugtekin will die.

40:50.840 --> 40:52.574
Tomorrow will be our blessed day.

40:55.007 --> 40:58.974
Then, we will have gotten
my revenge, Noyan.

41:14.607 --> 41:16.774
Keep Gokce Hatun in sight tonight.

41:19.707 --> 41:23.040
We need to hand her
to Sungurtekin safely.

41:24.107 --> 41:25.707
Do you understand?

42:23.140 --> 42:27.374
It is the same person who sent Gokce
Hatun to graveyard and put her dress...

42:28.107 --> 42:29.207
...into the den.

42:30.340 --> 42:32.240
A traitor from our nomad group.

42:33.640 --> 42:36.707
They must not understand
that we know there is a traitor.

42:39.240 --> 42:40.907
I will find that traitor.

42:41.774 --> 42:45.340
If he convinced Gokce Hatun
to go well into the graveyard...

42:45.974 --> 42:48.007
...then that traitor is
from my nomad group.

42:52.974 --> 42:54.907
What does Ameer Sadettin want from me?

42:55.674 --> 42:58.774
Ameer Sadettin stole Oghuz Khan seal...

42:59.374 --> 43:01.907
...and gave it to Tangut
so he can get Noyan killed.

43:02.840 --> 43:06.340
How come these two conspired
with each other? I cannot understand.

43:07.040 --> 43:10.140
Our enemies have formed
an alliance against us, brother.

43:11.307 --> 43:14.340
Sadettin Kobek wants us to
be hurt towards each other.

43:15.107 --> 43:19.307
By kidnapping a Bey's wife,
he wants to erase your reputation.

43:21.007 --> 43:25.740
He does not cover his hands in dirt
by making Noyan do all his dirty work.

43:26.207 --> 43:28.274
What kind of a game is this, son?

43:32.107 --> 43:34.607
How many more lives
will we give to this dog, huh?

43:38.640 --> 43:43.074
This is such a game mother,
its one end reaches to Gokce Hatun...

43:43.140 --> 43:46.307
...the other reaches to Sultan Alaeddin.

43:49.674 --> 43:54.240
What we did not let him do with
Gumustekin, now he wants to do it himself.

43:56.274 --> 44:00.874
He wants to be rid of Tugtekin Bey
and me without making both nomad groups...

44:00.940 --> 44:02.174
...oppose him.

44:03.607 --> 44:05.907
To bring Turkmen nomad groups to his heel.

44:16.607 --> 44:17.807
My children.

44:20.074 --> 44:23.274
Since he makes life unbearable to us...

44:24.207 --> 44:30.840
...he torments us, for the lives
he took, for the families he destroyed...

44:31.807 --> 44:36.174
...it is my will to you, do not
stop breathing down his neck.

44:38.140 --> 44:44.774
Take revenge from him, for the lives
he took, for the blood he shed.

44:48.674 --> 44:53.574
My children shall
get hurt rather than others.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.740
<i>What is it Bogac?</i>
 <i>What is wrong with the animal?</i>

45:05.074 --> 45:08.640
The horse is foundering, Bey.
It obviously hurts. It cannot ride.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.140
Bogac, return to nomad tent.

45:11.940 --> 45:14.374
-Do not be a burden to us in the battle.
-As you wish.

45:16.340 --> 45:17.907
I know who the traitor is.

45:25.274 --> 45:26.307
It is Bogac.

45:44.574 --> 45:47.240
Abdurrahman, where is Bogac?

45:47.874 --> 45:51.074
He went with the Alps whom Mother
Hayme sent to search for Gokce Hatun

46:15.740 --> 46:17.274
What is this crestfallenness?

46:17.907 --> 46:19.774
It is the time of resurrection.

46:19.840 --> 46:23.174
It is the time of dawn
after dark, brother.

46:24.374 --> 46:26.374
Turgut did not have a good day, brother.

46:27.207 --> 46:29.007
Our brother is taken prisoner again.

46:29.940 --> 46:32.640
Brother, we will find him.

46:32.707 --> 46:35.940
To find Turgut,
our horses' clops will merge...

46:36.007 --> 46:38.640
...with the sparkles of our swords.

46:38.707 --> 46:41.807
We will not leave our hope
or prayer lacking, brother.

46:42.340 --> 46:47.240
Because where our weapons cannot
reach, brother, our prayers will.

46:52.740 --> 46:54.340
You are right, Bamsi.

46:55.874 --> 46:58.240
We came out many battles,
we took many wounds...

46:58.874 --> 47:01.574
...we came back from
many deaths, did not crumble.

47:01.640 --> 47:02.874
Would we crumble now?

47:03.940 --> 47:05.140
Turgut Brother is alive.

47:06.040 --> 47:08.274
I know it, brother.
I know, Turgut is alive.

47:09.207 --> 47:11.574
Of course he is alive. He is alive.

47:11.640 --> 47:14.274
Did you forget how Turgut
escaped from Templars' hands?

47:15.274 --> 47:18.240
And brother, do you think
our Bey would leave Turgut Brother...

47:18.307 --> 47:20.707
...in a Mongol dog's hands?
Would you, brother?

47:21.107 --> 47:25.140
-Do you think I would leave him?
-We will not, brother.

47:25.207 --> 47:29.940
We will save Turgut Brother and make these
lands the tombs of those Mongol dogs.

47:31.140 --> 47:33.207
There is no woe as long as there is God.

47:33.274 --> 47:35.640
There is no woe as long as there is God.

47:35.707 --> 47:37.940
It is the time for resurrection, brother.

47:38.774 --> 47:40.974
God is almighty.

47:41.274 --> 47:43.974
Yes, brother. God is almighty.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.374
God bless!

48:33.074 --> 48:36.274
He said his horse was floundering
when we were going to raid the den.

48:36.340 --> 48:38.307
That bastard's intention was clear.

49:13.574 --> 49:15.940
And it is clear where this gold came from.

49:24.907 --> 49:26.707
Where is this bastard?

49:27.140 --> 49:30.174
He went to search
for Gokce Hatun with Alps.

49:34.640 --> 49:36.040
I will kill that bastard.

49:42.607 --> 49:44.307
Your rage is grand Tugtekin Bey.

49:44.374 --> 49:47.707
However Bogac is the one that
will lead you to Gokce Hatun.

49:47.774 --> 49:48.940
I know, Ertugrul Bey.

49:49.674 --> 49:51.574
That dog will lead me to Noyan.

49:52.174 --> 49:54.074
And I will send them both to hell.

49:59.874 --> 50:04.807
We cannot reach Noyan until he wants
us to. We should wait for a sign from him.

50:15.840 --> 50:21.340
Noyan kidnapped Gokce Hatun from
nomad tent as you ordered, his Ameer.

50:21.940 --> 50:24.107
Very well. Good, Bogac Alp.

50:25.707 --> 50:28.274
Your place in my graces
is rising more and more.

50:29.307 --> 50:33.640
I am always ready to give my
head for our state, his Ameer.

50:37.174 --> 50:39.140
Now, it is Tugtekin's turn.

50:39.907 --> 50:41.840
Go to Noyan at once.

50:42.307 --> 50:46.040
-Do away with Tugtekin.
-As you wish, his Ameer.

50:52.807 --> 50:54.807
Sungurtekin Bey is here, his Ameer.

50:54.874 --> 50:56.007
Let him come in.

50:58.574 --> 51:00.307
Leave from the backdoor.

51:00.374 --> 51:05.040
Go to Noyan when sun rises
and do away with Tugtekin together.

51:05.107 --> 51:07.174
As you wish. If you excuse me.

51:33.074 --> 51:34.640
Welcome, Sungurtekin Bey.

51:36.074 --> 51:38.773
Come, have a bite.

51:53.607 --> 51:57.240
What is it? I see you are bothered.

51:59.274 --> 52:01.340
We found Noyan's den.

52:01.574 --> 52:03.374
We killed his soldiers.

52:04.874 --> 52:07.607
We destroyed his den but...

52:07.674 --> 52:11.240
But you neither could find
him nor Shahzada Yigit.

52:14.074 --> 52:16.674
He knew we were going to raid his den.

52:16.740 --> 52:19.574
He took advantage
of our absence in nomad tent...

52:20.140 --> 52:23.907
...and wanted to kidnap
Gokce Hatun to entrap Tugtekin Bey.

52:25.007 --> 52:27.807
I received news from
my Alp who I sent to nomad tent.

52:30.307 --> 52:32.040
Noyan took what he wanted.

52:34.574 --> 52:36.140
I am sorry, Sungurtekin.

52:36.840 --> 52:41.074
I know you grew up with Gokce Hatun
in the same marquee, like siblings.

52:43.040 --> 52:47.107
He is fulfilling the oath he took
to extinct our kin one by one.

52:49.174 --> 52:51.907
There must be someone in
the nomad group who serves him.

52:51.974 --> 52:53.974
It is apparent he is not alone.

52:59.974 --> 53:01.340
Now it is time...

53:02.974 --> 53:05.074
...to fulfill the promise I gave you.

53:07.840 --> 53:12.140
I know that you think of the future of
your nomad group as much as the state.

53:14.774 --> 53:15.774
You are right.

53:16.840 --> 53:18.140
Noyan is not alone.

53:19.274 --> 53:22.340
I came to know there is a woman
from your nomad tent with him.

53:23.774 --> 53:26.640
And he sets all his games with her.

53:27.107 --> 53:29.007
Who is that woman?

53:30.840 --> 53:33.340
-I learnt Noyan's place, too.
-Where?

53:33.574 --> 53:37.874
If he kidnapped Gokce Hatun, he
must have taken her to his secret place.

53:39.007 --> 53:40.807
Shahzada Yigit must be there, too.

53:42.807 --> 53:46.340
Perform the mission
Sultan Alaeddin gave you.

53:47.574 --> 53:49.174
Kill Shahzada...

53:50.007 --> 53:52.274
...save Gokce Hatun...

53:53.840 --> 53:55.740
...and learn who the traitor is.

53:56.740 --> 53:59.340
Ameer Sadettin,
where is this secret place?

54:02.740 --> 54:06.040
Have a bite, first. Get a good rest.

54:07.240 --> 54:09.974
Tomorrow is the day
of battle for both of us.

54:11.607 --> 54:16.040
While you settle accounts with Noyan,
I will strike the headquarters...

54:16.107 --> 54:19.607
...of the revolter Turkmen Beys.
Yes, I found out where they are, too.

54:22.174 --> 54:29.007
Before the revolter Beys gather
raider Alps, against Sultan Alaeddin...

54:29.074 --> 54:31.240
... I will do away with them.

54:34.574 --> 54:40.240
Sungurtekin, it is time that
peace comes to these lands.

54:42.774 --> 54:44.774
My business here is done.

54:45.374 --> 54:47.674
I think of returning to Konya.

54:48.240 --> 54:52.374
And I would like to put someone
I trust in my place when I return.

54:54.007 --> 54:57.640
Sungurtekin. It is you.

56:21.940 --> 56:24.040
Death is quite close to you.

56:25.574 --> 56:31.607
If you are dreaming of escaping from me
as you did from the Templars, do not.

56:35.574 --> 56:39.340
If you are dreaming of
scaring me with death, do not.

56:41.707 --> 56:43.907
Death is reunion for me.

56:46.807 --> 56:51.307
Your woman was burnt alive while
she was trying to show prowess, too.

56:52.340 --> 56:54.007
You shall not burn, too.

57:23.907 --> 57:25.674
What is happening there?

57:37.240 --> 57:40.174
I came for the submittance letter
you would write to Ertugrul.

57:41.140 --> 57:44.074
Ertugrul Bey will not
betray Sultan Alaeddin.

57:44.140 --> 57:45.607
It is a loss of time.

57:46.074 --> 57:50.307
We need to gather the army and take
stand against Sultan Alaeddin at once.

57:52.107 --> 57:56.740
When you write the letter,
be sure that Ertugrul will come here.

57:57.174 --> 57:59.240
He will make your Beys more powerful.

58:00.140 --> 58:04.340
Your loyal Beys would like
to see Ertugrul submit to you.

58:05.374 --> 58:07.940
And Turgut Alp's life depends on it.

58:08.007 --> 58:10.307
Or else, they will take
their rage out on him.

58:48.945 --> 58:49.978
Here, Sheikh.

59:01.378 --> 59:04.378
Dervish enhanced his nomad dexterities.

59:04.445 --> 59:05.878
Thanks to you, Sheikh.

59:06.578 --> 59:09.545
-May God not taint our relish on earth.
-Amen.

59:12.312 --> 59:13.978
How is the situation at nomad tent?

59:14.212 --> 59:17.212
One trouble ends,
the other starts, Sheikh.

59:17.278 --> 59:19.978
Ertugrul Bey cannot lift his head up...

59:20.212 --> 59:22.845
...from striving with nuisances,
grappling with enemy.

59:22.912 --> 59:24.745
Permission.

59:26.612 --> 59:29.278
He must have been
able to, see, he visits us.

59:30.978 --> 59:33.512
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

59:33.578 --> 59:35.512
Peace be upon you, Bey.

59:43.412 --> 59:46.478
I heard God was pouring grace down on you.

59:50.245 --> 59:51.512
Grace?

59:51.578 --> 59:55.278
Your troubles,
nuisances never came to an end.

00:59:58.745 --> 01:00:01.378
We become astonished if a
day goes without trouble now.

01:00:01.445 --> 01:00:04.478
-Give a drop of molasses to your Bey, too.
-Okay, Sheikh.

01:00:17.512 --> 01:00:20.378
-Here, Bey.
-Thank you, Dervish.

01:00:25.312 --> 01:00:26.312
Delicious, no?

01:00:28.278 --> 01:00:31.245
-Bless your hands, Dervish.
-Enjoy, Bey.

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:34.845
Grape is different, molasses is different.

01:00:36.345 --> 01:00:38.812
You have to be a grape to become molasses.

01:00:40.212 --> 01:00:44.212
Yet, grape is not molasses.
And molasses is not grape.

01:00:45.512 --> 01:00:50.012
Grape cures one ill but
molasses cures a thousand.

01:00:56.512 --> 01:01:01.812
Grape becomes molasses
after long and grueling journeys.

01:01:02.512 --> 01:01:04.312
To cure a thousand ill...

01:01:04.378 --> 01:01:09.345
...you need to be snatched from your
home, to be crushed, to boil in flames.

01:01:10.645 --> 01:01:13.978
There is a pain, a struggle,
a suffering in every pleasure.

01:01:14.978 --> 01:01:18.645
You need to take on
this journey to cure a thousand ill.

01:01:20.245 --> 01:01:23.945
Child, from the first day
you set off to Aleppo...

01:01:24.012 --> 01:01:27.745
...by my God's allowance,
you faced many troubles...

01:01:27.812 --> 01:01:30.012
...you brought
many enemies to their knees.

01:01:31.312 --> 01:01:34.545
Who knows what troubles you will
encounter on this holy journey.

01:01:35.645 --> 01:01:39.445
Many pharaohs,
many demons will set traps for you.

01:01:40.512 --> 01:01:41.878
They will try to overcome you.

01:01:43.012 --> 01:01:45.512
As long as they torment you...

01:01:45.578 --> 01:01:49.212
...God willing, you and
your kin will make history.

01:01:54.612 --> 01:01:55.812
If God permits.

01:01:56.812 --> 01:01:59.645
It is as if I fell into a
different trouble this time.

01:02:01.878 --> 01:02:04.545
As if there are abysses
between me and my brothers.

01:02:06.278 --> 01:02:08.678
The mad horses within
me cannot dream with them...

01:02:09.845 --> 01:02:11.712
...cannot battle by their side anymore.

01:02:15.545 --> 01:02:16.612
Remember, son.

01:02:17.712 --> 01:02:19.945
His brothers threw Joseph to the well.

01:02:21.278 --> 01:02:22.845
And Joseph forgave them.

01:02:26.545 --> 01:02:29.245
May God grant us a heart like Joseph's.

01:02:29.945 --> 01:02:30.945
Amen.

01:02:34.845 --> 01:02:36.312
Amen.

01:03:56.278 --> 01:04:00.712
Ertugrul Bey will come to you hastily
when he reads this letter from Sultan.

01:04:03.312 --> 01:04:07.512
The day is the day for battle,
Sultan. May our path be blessed.

01:04:37.645 --> 01:04:41.845
Konur Bey, have this letter delivered to
Ertugrul Bey with a messenger at once.

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:44.745
I wish to see him in my presence tomorrow.

01:04:46.978 --> 01:04:48.445
As you wish, Sultan.

01:05:19.878 --> 01:05:21.845
Sultan wrote the submittance letter.

01:05:23.412 --> 01:05:25.845
Ertugrul will act valiantly
and come to these fools.

01:05:26.845 --> 01:05:28.778
Do not be here when he arrives.

01:05:29.312 --> 01:05:31.612
I do not want you
get hurt in that blood bath.

01:05:33.745 --> 01:05:35.945
Neither Beys nor Alps want us here, Noyan.

01:05:37.712 --> 01:05:39.978
We took many lives
of them shepherds at the time.

01:05:41.278 --> 01:05:42.845
What will happen to Turgut Alp?

01:05:43.912 --> 01:05:46.612
No one will be left alive here
when Sadettin comes.

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:50.545
Take good care of the boy. Do as I said.

01:06:26.745 --> 01:06:28.512
Selcan, my wife.

01:06:30.412 --> 01:06:33.312
Everybody knows how you gave Noyan hell.

01:06:35.212 --> 01:06:36.878
Gokce is of your blood, too.

01:06:37.478 --> 01:06:39.845
She will certainly give him
hell, too. Do not worry.

01:06:40.812 --> 01:06:44.578
How will my sister do with
that Mongol dog, Gundogdu?

01:06:45.545 --> 01:06:47.245
He will kill my sister.

01:06:48.512 --> 01:06:50.945
God forbid, Hatun. Do not talk like that.

01:06:51.012 --> 01:06:53.845
Keep your heart at ease.
She will surely return to her home.

01:06:57.678 --> 01:06:59.012
Let us leave here.

01:07:00.645 --> 01:07:03.212
Everyday a new trouble befalls us.

01:07:05.778 --> 01:07:06.845
Let us leave.

01:07:07.512 --> 01:07:10.812
Let us go to the lands
where we can raise our child in peace.

01:07:55.312 --> 01:07:57.478
I have searched
for a woman to love  for years.

01:08:00.812 --> 01:08:02.678
I lost her before I attained my wish.

01:08:08.645 --> 01:08:09.945
Do not lose your hope.

01:08:10.612 --> 01:08:11.712
You will retrieve her.

01:08:12.945 --> 01:08:16.445
That savage has the woman
I could not dare to savor the scent of.

01:08:19.945 --> 01:08:22.012
Who knows what pains she is suffering.

01:08:23.812 --> 01:08:25.278
And I am waiting here.

01:08:31.678 --> 01:08:33.778
I feel like I will go
insane the more I think.

01:08:55.545 --> 01:08:56.812
What if they torture her?

01:09:00.212 --> 01:09:01.812
What if they do something to her?

01:09:04.845 --> 01:09:05.845
What if...

01:09:11.512 --> 01:09:12.512
Brother!

01:09:13.645 --> 01:09:14.778
Brother.

01:09:17.745 --> 01:09:19.712
I will bring her back to her marquee.

01:09:21.912 --> 01:09:24.278
If I cannot bring her
back to her marquee...

01:09:25.778 --> 01:09:27.578
...this land becomes a grave for me.

01:09:30.912 --> 01:09:32.278
Be patient for a while.

01:09:32.845 --> 01:09:33.845
Be patient.

01:09:35.378 --> 01:09:38.278
My God will unite you. Stay strong.

01:10:37.845 --> 01:10:38.845
Halime.

01:10:41.212 --> 01:10:43.012
I do not have a word to console you.

01:10:44.578 --> 01:10:45.978
And it crushes me.

01:10:48.212 --> 01:10:50.312
We have no one
but God to take shelter in...

01:10:51.278 --> 01:10:53.545
...and we have nothing
to turn to but patience.

01:10:56.312 --> 01:10:58.412
You know my brother would not betray.

01:11:00.245 --> 01:11:01.612
You always protect him.

01:11:02.645 --> 01:11:03.945
That is my consolation, Bey.

01:11:05.645 --> 01:11:11.745
You, my mother, your brothers
did all you can for my brother.

01:11:12.645 --> 01:11:13.678
I know that.

01:11:15.978 --> 01:11:17.445
Is there permission, Bey?

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:24.712
Come in, Abdurrahman.

01:11:29.778 --> 01:11:31.778
Bey, Konur Alp sent a messenger.

01:11:33.545 --> 01:11:34.612
He brought a letter.

01:11:35.545 --> 01:11:36.978
Do not let that revolter Alp in.

01:11:38.345 --> 01:11:39.878
-I will come.
-As you wish, Bey.

01:11:53.378 --> 01:11:54.745
Son, what is happening?

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:57.278
The news I waited for has come.

01:12:05.545 --> 01:12:07.578
I have a letter for you from our Sultan.

01:12:10.912 --> 01:12:14.945
I am given the duty of taking you to our
Sultan if you follow the letter's summons.

01:12:17.612 --> 01:12:20.645
-Wait for me at the end of the nomad tent.
-As you wish, Bey.

01:12:56.645 --> 01:12:58.212
We have news from Yigit.

01:13:00.378 --> 01:13:01.612
Halime.

01:13:25.512 --> 01:13:26.745
What does it say?

01:13:28.478 --> 01:13:29.912
What does Yigit say, Halime?

01:14:02.778 --> 01:14:04.812
Tugtekin Bey will not fall to your trap.

01:14:05.978 --> 01:14:07.578
You will not kill him.

01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:12.545
Why? Is it because my aunt
said you were in love with Ertugrul?

01:14:14.512 --> 01:14:16.745
Tugtekin does not
want me as his wife anymore.

01:14:17.512 --> 01:14:19.778
He will not come to Noyan's feet for me.

01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:27.845
And when he comes,
he will come to wreck you.

01:14:29.845 --> 01:14:33.645
You all will have your share
of Tugtekin Bey's sword.

01:14:34.878 --> 01:14:36.012
Gokce Hatun!

01:14:38.278 --> 01:14:41.012
Do you think I do not know
how Tugtekin is in love with you?

01:14:41.745 --> 01:14:43.878
That fool lover
would risk everything for you.

01:14:45.712 --> 01:14:48.678
I understood that when my aunt
told him you loved Ertugrul.

01:14:51.712 --> 01:14:54.478
He would do everything for you.
He would even spurn death.

01:14:56.945 --> 01:15:00.578
He will fall running into Noyan's trap.

01:15:04.012 --> 01:15:07.645
He will give his head
to Noyan's sword.

01:15:08.478 --> 01:15:09.478
You will see.

01:15:42.812 --> 01:15:44.545
What does Yigit say, Halime?

01:15:45.778 --> 01:15:50.678
He says he wants you to take the rein
of his armies, become his commander.

01:15:52.778 --> 01:15:56.512
Thereupon, the Beys who revolted
want you to align yourself with them.

01:16:01.245 --> 01:16:02.812
How could he do this? How?

01:16:04.878 --> 01:16:07.345
When we trust him,
when we shed tears for him...

01:16:09.945 --> 01:16:11.812
He saw what my father has gone through.

01:16:12.778 --> 01:16:15.545
How much we suffered
in the hands of Templars?

01:16:16.612 --> 01:16:18.212
How can he descend this much?

01:16:20.612 --> 01:16:21.645
Halime.

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:23.812
Halime, look at me.

01:16:25.378 --> 01:16:28.445
We both know Yigit is too
honorable to do such thing.

01:16:32.812 --> 01:16:34.545
There is something wrong.

01:16:35.845 --> 01:16:37.712
Then why does he pull you into a trap?

01:16:38.712 --> 01:16:40.878
Why does he want you
to come with a messenger?

01:16:42.412 --> 01:16:45.912
You cannot go with the messenger,
Ertugrul. Do not even think about it.

01:17:03.345 --> 01:17:04.445
Ertugrul!

01:17:05.945 --> 01:17:08.778
My brother wrote a secret
information inside the letter.

01:17:12.745 --> 01:17:14.378
My father taught us that.

01:17:14.445 --> 01:17:16.545
Use the first and last letter of the word.

01:17:16.612 --> 01:17:18.412
And write a letter within a letter.

01:17:19.578 --> 01:17:21.545
-What does Yigit say?
-Turgut is alive.

01:17:22.378 --> 01:17:24.478
He will save him and stop the rebellion.

01:17:26.545 --> 01:17:27.878
He wants you to go to him.

01:17:35.945 --> 01:17:36.945
My God!

01:18:15.545 --> 01:18:17.312
Look at Gokce Hatun.

01:19:20.678 --> 01:19:21.712
Die, you scum!

01:23:02.578 --> 01:23:04.378
You have nowhere to run to, Gokce.

01:23:05.212 --> 01:23:08.378
I don't have a problem
with you. I want Fiery Boy.

01:23:09.212 --> 01:23:11.512
Give one, take one.
Let us not sadden each other.

01:23:19.645 --> 01:23:23.445
So he did it for his state,
for our brother Turgut, huh, Bey?

01:23:24.645 --> 01:23:27.245
Yigit Alp is a gallant
Alp as his name suggests.

01:23:27.312 --> 01:23:28.945
He did not let you down.

01:23:30.345 --> 01:23:31.678
Yigit has done his part.

01:23:32.912 --> 01:23:34.478
Now, it is our turn.

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:38.678
So, when are we taking off, Bey?

01:23:39.545 --> 01:23:44.245
Yes, Bey, let us go and get
Yigit Alp and Turgut Brother at once.

01:23:49.512 --> 01:23:51.312
They want me to go alone.

01:23:52.312 --> 01:23:53.578
I will go by myself.

01:23:54.712 --> 01:23:56.645
We must follow the rules of the game.

01:23:57.678 --> 01:24:00.812
Bey, you are talking about going
in alone amongst the revolters.

01:24:02.812 --> 01:24:06.012
And Noyan is there, too, Bey.
Apparently, he is waiting for you.

01:24:07.278 --> 01:24:10.312
Kill us but do not say you will go alone.

01:24:13.945 --> 01:24:15.612
What is destined will happen.

01:24:18.278 --> 01:24:23.878
The only solution is, I go alone and
eloign Turkmen Beys from rebellion.

01:24:24.645 --> 01:24:27.912
That is the only way I can bring
Yigit and Turgut to the nomad tent.

01:24:29.712 --> 01:24:32.745
That is the only way to be rid
of Kopek who haunts our state...

01:24:32.812 --> 01:24:36.312
...and Noyan who plagues our nomad groups.

01:24:38.278 --> 01:24:41.878
If we do not cry out the right
by ourselves to the revolters...

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:48.245
...to hypocrites, to traitors when
needed, as Prophet Abraham did...

01:24:49.645 --> 01:24:52.245
...Nimrods will not
refrain from shedding blood.

01:24:55.745 --> 01:24:57.678
One needs to be afire to be Abraham.

01:25:00.845 --> 01:25:01.945
Bey.

01:25:02.612 --> 01:25:07.812
We live to burn like Abraham did for
God and to surrender like Ismail did.

01:25:08.978 --> 01:25:13.412
Bey, why do you keep yourself distant
from us when our purpose is the same.

01:25:33.678 --> 01:25:35.278
Kayi women are nimble.

01:25:36.745 --> 01:25:38.345
I learnt that from Selcan Hatun.

01:25:40.012 --> 01:25:41.412
You are like your sister.

01:25:43.212 --> 01:25:46.978
I will build a harem of Kayi women
for myself, when the time comes.

01:25:48.578 --> 01:25:52.512
I will not remove
my armor when I bed them.

01:26:38.412 --> 01:26:39.912
Why would you lay here woman?

01:26:50.645 --> 01:26:52.278
Your blood made your grave.

01:26:56.212 --> 01:26:57.778
Your rosy face withered.

01:26:59.512 --> 01:27:01.412
It became sorrowful as the Gobi desert.

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:32.978
I will offer you
to sacred lands with my own hands.

01:27:36.912 --> 01:27:41.678
I will sacrifice you,
Ertugrul, Tugtekin and many more...

01:27:42.678 --> 01:27:44.645
...for Heavenly Father.

01:27:47.912 --> 01:27:49.778
I will drown all of you in your blood.

01:27:50.512 --> 01:27:53.012
The sacred lands will
gush out your carrions.

01:28:43.778 --> 01:28:46.945
You cannot untie this deadlock
without ceding from your life.

01:28:48.578 --> 01:28:51.012
Our duty is to take lives
and give lives for God...

01:28:51.712 --> 01:28:53.945
...without drawing away
from the path of God.

01:28:56.645 --> 01:28:58.712
If I do not return, give your blessing.

01:28:59.778 --> 01:29:01.512
And send my greetings to Wise Men.

01:29:02.345 --> 01:29:05.312
Tell them that Ertugrul
died as a martyr on this blessed path.

01:29:07.778 --> 01:29:10.445
May God help and protect you, Bey.

01:29:12.412 --> 01:29:13.412
Amen.

01:29:20.778 --> 01:29:24.212
Ertugrul is playing with fire again.
How would I leave him alone?

01:29:26.312 --> 01:29:27.478
Gundogdu.

01:29:28.545 --> 01:29:30.345
Ertugrul is going to his destiny.

01:29:31.545 --> 01:29:33.578
We cannot do anything.

01:29:34.312 --> 01:29:36.912
Do you not know he would
not return upon your word?

01:29:37.778 --> 01:29:39.612
He is the half of my heart, mother.

01:29:40.478 --> 01:29:42.312
How would I leave my heart without me?

01:29:51.212 --> 01:29:52.245
Gundogdu.

01:30:52.678 --> 01:30:54.012
You traitor scum!

01:30:55.845 --> 01:30:56.978
Traitor!

01:31:16.712 --> 01:31:17.945
Listen to me carefully.

01:31:19.512 --> 01:31:20.712
Bring me Tugtekin.

01:31:21.445 --> 01:31:24.212
The time has come.
I will wait for him at the narrow pass.

01:31:24.978 --> 01:31:27.212
As you wish, Noyan.

01:32:09.812 --> 01:32:11.845
The news I waited from Yigit has come.

01:32:12.912 --> 01:32:14.678
I will go to the revolters' base.

01:32:17.412 --> 01:32:18.912
While you are looking for Gokce...

01:32:19.545 --> 01:32:22.512
...do not fall for
your anger and fall into his trap.

01:32:24.812 --> 01:32:26.345
Both your lives depend on it.

01:32:29.278 --> 01:32:30.578
You know who is the traitor.

01:32:31.945 --> 01:32:33.412
And who is behind him.

01:32:34.712 --> 01:32:35.712
Take measures.

01:32:37.278 --> 01:32:38.812
They will pull you to a trap.

01:32:41.445 --> 01:32:47.212
If getting entrapped like Prophet Huseyin
and to die longing for a drop of water...

01:32:47.945 --> 01:32:50.278
...is in our share, we will take it.

01:32:51.678 --> 01:32:52.778
Alright.

01:32:55.012 --> 01:32:58.845
I will speak with the revolter Beys
and explain this is Kobek's ruse.

01:32:59.578 --> 01:33:00.978
What if they don't believe you?

01:33:03.245 --> 01:33:05.312
Our loved ones' lives depends on it.

01:33:07.578 --> 01:33:08.578
Give your blessing.

01:33:13.912 --> 01:33:16.012
Noyan will certainly send a sign to you.

01:33:17.012 --> 01:33:18.012
Be nimble.

01:33:18.678 --> 01:33:19.712
Do not worry.

01:33:21.878 --> 01:33:23.345
Ertugrul Bey.

01:33:26.745 --> 01:33:28.912
If God allows
and we get rid of this trouble...

01:33:30.345 --> 01:33:32.612
...I will come to the
Byzantium border with you.

01:33:33.712 --> 01:33:35.712
Me and my nomad group are at your service.

01:33:38.278 --> 01:33:40.445
May God help us all, Tugtekin Bey.

01:33:41.245 --> 01:33:42.245
Amen.

01:33:58.412 --> 01:33:59.678
Soon, Gokce Hatun.

01:34:00.445 --> 01:34:03.212
You will unite with your man
not to be separated again.

01:34:04.412 --> 01:34:06.978
Do you think Tugtekin
would let you get away with these?

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:12.278
You are fiery like your man.

01:34:12.912 --> 01:34:15.345
Fiery Boy must be
exhausted of your longing.

01:34:16.312 --> 01:34:17.478
Do not keep him waiting.

01:35:32.945 --> 01:35:35.478
If Aktolgali will take
you to your destiny...

01:35:36.378 --> 01:35:37.612
...then may God help you.

01:35:38.912 --> 01:35:40.612
May the sun not burn your skin.

01:35:41.712 --> 01:35:43.578
May the rain not make your body perish.

01:35:44.678 --> 01:35:46.245
May not a rock touch your feet.

01:35:46.845 --> 01:35:48.912
Leave like water
and come back like water.

01:35:49.878 --> 01:35:52.578
Call the ones who attempted
against our nomad group...

01:35:53.412 --> 01:35:57.245
...my brother, our state
to account, then come Ertugrul.

01:35:58.478 --> 01:36:04.012
Know that I am going to the ones
we love, the ones we would die for.

01:36:05.412 --> 01:36:09.578
Aktolgali will take me
like a bird and bring me back at once.

01:36:13.378 --> 01:36:15.978
As long as the ones left
behind are not destitute...

01:36:17.845 --> 01:36:19.445
...and their hopes do not wane.

01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:06.978
Sultan is waiting for you.

01:37:07.578 --> 01:37:10.245
However, he also wants to be
sure we are not followed.

01:37:10.845 --> 01:37:14.578
Other Alps will take you on the road,
they will escort you to Sultan.

01:37:14.978 --> 01:37:18.778
But if anyone follows,
the meeting will not take place.

01:37:19.312 --> 01:37:20.945
We will not be responsible for that.

01:37:27.345 --> 01:37:28.645
Ertugrul!

01:37:48.412 --> 01:37:49.412
He's gone, mother.

01:37:50.812 --> 01:37:53.478
I left him alone because of my damned arm.

01:37:58.812 --> 01:38:00.812
He took a part of our souls when he left.

01:38:03.445 --> 01:38:05.945
But we need to be fortitude.

01:38:07.545 --> 01:38:12.445
We will pray so where he went would
not become his grave but our hope...

01:38:15.545 --> 01:38:21.478
...so he would not return from where he
reached with a funeral but with victory.

01:38:23.445 --> 01:38:24.512
If God permits.

01:39:07.404 --> 01:39:10.438
We found Shahzada Yigit's den...

01:39:12.971 --> 01:39:15.838
...the one who threatened
the perpetuity of state...

01:39:17.771 --> 01:39:24.238
...who disregarded Sultan who aggravated
and debauched Turkmen Beys.

01:39:25.504 --> 01:39:31.738
Now, our duty is to ensure the welfare
of our Sultan and our state.

01:39:34.704 --> 01:39:37.838
This home of rebellion will be razed

01:39:38.538 --> 01:39:45.304
and whoever submitted to him will be
killed along with Shahzada Yigit.

01:39:48.738 --> 01:39:51.238
Whoever participated in this negligence.

01:39:53.771 --> 01:39:59.604
They will have their share of our swords'

01:39:59.671 --> 01:40:01.938
cold and piercing side.

01:40:02.704 --> 01:40:08.238
Traitors must die!
Long live, Sultan Aleaddin!

01:40:11.904 --> 01:40:17.904
Traitors must die!
Long live, Sultan Aleaddin!

01:41:07.371 --> 01:41:12.338
If you will try to persuade me to submit
to you, do not waste your breath.

01:41:13.271 --> 01:41:14.738
I will not submit to you.

01:41:20.304 --> 01:41:24.438
Turgut Alp, I am not worried
about becoming sultan.

01:41:29.004 --> 01:41:30.604
I worry about saving you.

01:41:31.771 --> 01:41:33.804
Do you think I have forgotten
the pains you have suffered

01:41:33.971 --> 01:41:35.671
on Templars' hands because of me?

01:41:41.571 --> 01:41:45.571
Noyan forced me into this.
He threatened me with killing Dundar.

01:41:47.471 --> 01:41:49.971
I had to enter this game
to save Dundar's life.

01:41:56.038 --> 01:41:58.338
And now I wish to release you from here

01:41:58.438 --> 01:42:00.938
and stop this rebellion with
Ertugrul Bey's support.

01:42:02.871 --> 01:42:04.304
What are you saying, Yigit?

01:42:06.438 --> 01:42:08.271
I wrote a letter to Ertugrul Bey.

01:42:08.671 --> 01:42:11.271
When my sister reads the letter
she will find out the truth.

01:42:15.904 --> 01:42:18.604
You will return to nomad tent and
bring Ertugrul Bey here, Turgut Alp.

01:42:19.338 --> 01:42:22.538
And I will do all I can to dissuade
Turkmen Beys from this rebellion.

01:42:23.471 --> 01:42:24.704
When Ertugrul Bey comes

01:42:24.871 --> 01:42:27.438
he will vanquish the traitor rebels
whom were not persuaded.

01:42:29.938 --> 01:42:32.904
I will not leave you here alone, Yigit.
Do not ask this from me.

01:42:33.538 --> 01:42:35.238
I ventured everything, Turgut Alp.

01:42:35.571 --> 01:42:39.704
I will sacrifice my life on this path for
our state, for our loved ones, if need be.

01:42:54.271 --> 01:42:57.738
You will be tied here like a dog
until you submit to me.

01:42:59.038 --> 01:43:00.471
I am at the end of my tether.

01:43:32.838 --> 01:43:36.271
Bey, Bogac was seen at the exit
of the nomad tent.

01:43:36.771 --> 01:43:38.304
Get on the horses. We are setting forth.

01:44:51.438 --> 01:44:52.504
Locate yourselves.

01:45:05.938 --> 01:45:08.771
Bey. We located Alps to places you told.

01:45:09.004 --> 01:45:10.404
What will we do now, Bey?

01:45:10.838 --> 01:45:13.271
There is no horse around.
Apparently, there is no one around.

01:45:13.838 --> 01:45:16.004
-They shall wait for Noyan.
-For Noyan, Bey?

01:45:16.771 --> 01:45:20.871
Noyan will come here, sooner or later.
Everyone shall keep their eyes open.

01:45:21.638 --> 01:45:25.704
Even if he is alone, he will not die
before taking many of us.

01:45:26.604 --> 01:45:28.004
Do you understand me?

01:46:43.738 --> 01:46:44.804
Alps.

01:47:26.271 --> 01:47:28.704
-Ulubilge!
-Ulubilge, captive is escaping!

01:47:28.771 --> 01:47:31.338
Captive is escaping!

01:47:31.404 --> 01:47:33.538
Turgut is escaping! Catch him!

01:47:59.804 --> 01:48:01.704
We will get off the horses here.

01:48:36.971 --> 01:48:39.038
You will continue with your eyes
closed from here.

01:48:40.438 --> 01:48:41.638
Hand your sword.

01:49:06.604 --> 01:49:09.504
Ertugrul, son of Suleyman Shah,
never gives his weapon.

01:49:09.804 --> 01:49:10.971
Walk ahead.

01:49:44.304 --> 01:49:45.438
Bogac.

01:49:46.238 --> 01:49:47.271
Bogac!

01:51:09.904 --> 01:51:11.471
It looks awkward.

01:51:19.271 --> 01:51:22.971
Give it to me so I can show you
how well hatchet suits me.

01:53:20.238 --> 01:53:21.938
-Brother!
-Bey!

01:53:37.004 --> 01:53:38.471
By God!

01:53:39.438 --> 01:53:42.438
-By God!
-By God!

01:53:46.038 --> 01:53:47.604
By God!

01:54:01.638 --> 01:54:02.904
By God!

01:54:55.638 --> 01:54:56.904
Turgut!

01:55:00.738 --> 01:55:01.938
Shut him up!

01:56:40.638 --> 01:56:42.771
Thank God they did not touch
your life, brother.

01:56:43.704 --> 01:56:46.404
If it was not Yigit, I would have been
dead by now, Bey.

01:56:46.671 --> 01:56:47.804
I know it all.

01:56:47.938 --> 01:56:50.338
He proved he is a brother
befitting Halime Sultan.

01:56:50.438 --> 01:56:51.471
Thank you.

01:56:51.738 --> 01:56:54.538
I lost my mind, brother.
I thought you were dead.

01:56:56.904 --> 01:57:00.038
Would anything happen to my brother?
They tried to kill him many times

01:57:00.271 --> 01:57:01.404
-...they could not do it.
-Thank you.

01:57:01.504 --> 01:57:04.771
Brother, how did you severed his head?
It slashed like a watermelon.

01:57:08.338 --> 01:57:09.571
Brother!

01:58:10.504 --> 01:58:12.371
The day I learned about your betrayal...

01:58:13.438 --> 01:58:15.838
...I offered your carrion to
holy spirits, Sungurtekin.

01:58:18.804 --> 01:58:21.338
I will give both your carrions to spirits.

01:58:21.471 --> 01:58:24.471
And Oghuz Khan's seal will be my reward.

01:58:28.004 --> 01:58:30.471
I will return to extinct your kin,
Sungurtekin.

01:58:30.638 --> 01:58:34.671
Tell Ertugrul to wait for me. I will
strike your nomad tent like lightning.

01:58:44.571 --> 01:58:46.438
<i>I will kill you this time, Noyan.</i>

01:58:48.604 --> 01:58:50.538
<i>Be it my oath, I will kill you.</i>

01:59:42.271 --> 01:59:43.304
Bogac.

01:59:46.471 --> 01:59:48.738
Gokce, where are you?

01:59:54.304 --> 01:59:55.938
Gokce, where are you?

01:59:56.771 --> 01:59:58.638
Ride! This way!

02:00:02.671 --> 02:00:04.004
Gokce, where are you?

02:00:05.004 --> 02:00:07.004
-Let go of me!
-Gokce!

02:00:34.538 --> 02:00:35.571
Goncagul?

02:01:05.371 --> 02:01:06.904
Come here, the boy with fire.

02:01:07.804 --> 02:01:09.738
Tugtekin, I beg you, go away from here.

02:01:13.271 --> 02:01:16.604
Tugtekin, I beg you, go away from here.
Go, he will kill you.

02:01:18.238 --> 02:01:21.838
Tugtekin, I beg you, leave.
I beg you. He will kill you.

02:01:22.371 --> 02:01:24.604
We had an unfinished business
left from last time.

02:01:25.504 --> 02:01:27.404
Now, it is time to finish that business.

02:01:29.371 --> 02:01:32.804
Since you came out of the hole I threw
you because I thought you died

02:01:33.304 --> 02:01:34.638
then let us finish it.

02:01:57.704 --> 02:01:58.938
Let Gokce Hatun go.

02:02:00.471 --> 02:02:01.838
You have what you wanted.

02:02:02.638 --> 02:02:04.338
See, I am in front of you.

02:02:05.771 --> 02:02:08.671
I will free her suffering soul forever.

02:02:09.771 --> 02:02:13.538
She took Goncagul from me.
And I will take her from you.

02:02:14.871 --> 02:02:18.471
An eye for an eye, Fiery Boy.
Eye for an eye.

02:02:21.671 --> 02:02:24.771
If your wife behaved well,
she would have lived.

02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:28.404
Perhaps, she would be devastated
by your pain.

02:02:29.238 --> 02:02:30.804
But she would still live.

02:02:32.004 --> 02:02:36.338
My problem is with Ertugrul.
With the ones who share his blood.

02:02:40.371 --> 02:02:42.638
Tugtekin, I beg you, leave here.

02:02:43.671 --> 02:02:46.404
He will kill you. I beg you, go, Tugtekin.

02:02:47.238 --> 02:02:48.438
No.

02:02:50.271 --> 02:02:53.371
I free your suffering soul forever.

02:02:54.338 --> 02:02:55.538
No.

02:02:55.971 --> 02:02:57.971
I am yours, Tugtekin.

02:02:59.571 --> 02:03:01.604
I will be yours forever.

02:03:01.671 --> 02:03:02.971
No.

02:03:03.604 --> 02:03:04.704
No!

02:03:29.438 --> 02:03:33.671
He cut his ropes with a dagger.
Who gave him that dagger?

02:03:36.604 --> 02:03:39.738
Sultan, do you have
any information on this?

02:03:43.271 --> 02:03:44.704
Ertugrul Bey arrived!

02:03:48.371 --> 02:03:49.704
Ertugrul Bey.

02:03:50.971 --> 02:03:52.638
Ertugrul Bey arrived.

02:03:55.004 --> 02:03:56.471
Ertugrul Bey.

02:04:38.938 --> 02:04:42.871
I came here so neither you
nor Shahzada Yigit

02:04:43.838 --> 02:04:48.538
or Sultan Aleaddin would become
an instrument in a traitorous game.

02:04:50.004 --> 02:04:55.704
You should know, Ameer Sadettin
is behind your rebellion.

02:04:56.938 --> 02:05:01.038
He was aware of every step
you took from the beginning.

02:05:01.838 --> 02:05:04.704
Ameer Sadettin is the one
that coalesced with Noyan

02:05:04.904 --> 02:05:07.971
and pulled you into this traitorous trap.

02:05:09.538 --> 02:05:14.004
He resorted to such a game because
he knew you would not submit to him.

02:05:15.238 --> 02:05:18.738
We will not give up on this path
as long as our Sultan is with us.

02:05:22.438 --> 02:05:26.804
We hosted you because we wanted
to be the commander of our Alps

02:05:27.604 --> 02:05:30.604
since we know you are gallant
and undefeatable.

02:05:31.404 --> 02:05:32.871
Behave as a guest.

02:05:33.404 --> 02:05:35.604
Do you still not understand, Konur Bey?

02:05:36.304 --> 02:05:41.538
I tell you Ameer Sadettin will kill anyone
who does not submit to himself.

02:05:44.338 --> 02:05:45.604
And you first.

02:05:47.404 --> 02:05:51.638
Maybe he is coming onto us
with his soldiers right now.

02:05:52.438 --> 02:05:54.004
You are ruining yourselves

02:05:54.338 --> 02:05:59.238
your nomad groups, your Alps
as you persist.

02:06:03.238 --> 02:06:04.804
The honorable Beys of Oghuz!

02:06:06.538 --> 02:06:11.704
We have only one state wedged
inbetween Mongols and Crusaders

02:06:12.504 --> 02:06:14.338
and that is Seljukian Empire.

02:06:16.538 --> 02:06:20.404
This state Kinik Beys founded
is all of our state.

02:06:22.038 --> 02:06:27.904
Neither ignobles like Kobek nor
the enemies of our state can inhibit it.

02:06:29.904 --> 02:06:33.504
Now, I say, give up before it is too late.

02:06:33.938 --> 02:06:39.338
Give up so our state will be everlasting
and our enemies be parried.

02:06:40.371 --> 02:06:41.704
Catch Ertugrul Bey!

02:06:42.471 --> 02:06:43.638
Stop!

02:06:45.371 --> 02:06:47.271
Ertugrul Bey's words are right.

02:06:54.571 --> 02:06:57.404
Know that I renounce from the throne
that is rightfully mine.

02:06:57.971 --> 02:06:59.871
You do not have a Sultan anymore.

02:07:12.538 --> 02:07:14.304
-Irruption!
-Yigit!

02:07:14.471 --> 02:07:16.704
-Irruption!
-Yigit!
