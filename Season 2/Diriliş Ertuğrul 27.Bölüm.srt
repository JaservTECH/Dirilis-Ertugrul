00:01.000 --> 00:03.000
Episode 27 will start after 12:24 min

12:24.096 --> 12:27.096
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:29.003 --> 12:30.653
WE HAVE BEEN ON THIS LAND
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS

12:30.934 --> 12:33.170
AND WE WILL BE HERE
FOR A THOUSAND MORE YEARS.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.990
MAY GOD BLESS OUR MARTYRS SOULS.

12:36.075 --> 12:39.075
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:40.096 --> 12:43.096
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:30.016 --> 13:31.016
Halime.

13:35.849 --> 13:36.849
Halime!

13:48.782 --> 13:49.782
Halime!

13:52.049 --> 13:53.049
Halime!

13:56.582 --> 13:57.582
Halime!

14:37.382 --> 14:40.316
What is it that you keep in your heart
but cannot say?

14:40.649 --> 14:42.649
You have been in silence for days.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.782
If I said a bad word,
may my tongue rot away.

14:46.682 --> 14:49.716
If I broke your heart without noticing,
may my heart shatter.

14:51.016 --> 14:54.849
If a bad word comes my way, I would rather
that it came from your sweet tongue.

14:56.649 --> 14:58.582
You are my man, my hero for so long.

14:59.916 --> 15:03.649
I never heard you say a bad word to me
and not even once you broke my heart.

15:04.116 --> 15:06.349
Then, what is the reason of
your silence?

15:13.782 --> 15:17.649
Since Suleyman Shah died, two winters
and three summers have passed Ertugrul.

15:19.382 --> 15:20.816
We have never stopped.

15:22.049 --> 15:24.982
We have never seen a peace of mind
in winter or summer hold.

15:27.116 --> 15:30.716
It is said that a nomad realizes
their exhaustion when they get settled.

15:32.382 --> 15:35.049
Spring is coming and bringing me
the worry of the road ahead.

15:37.782 --> 15:39.949
However, neither I look for the light...

15:40.649 --> 15:42.916
...nor the worry of migration
blackens my heart.

15:44.616 --> 15:46.316
It is enough for me to be with you.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.849
We have a few days
ahead of us to the new winter hold.

16:17.949 --> 16:20.816
My uncle's nomad group is near.
A safe place a couple of days away.

16:20.916 --> 16:23.949
If we can manage to get through
this winter, the rest will be easy.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.916
There will be nothing left to worry.

16:26.682 --> 16:29.349
If God permits, we will reach
the homeland we deserve.

16:29.449 --> 16:31.516
I do not worry for myself, Ertugrul.

17:09.816 --> 17:10.949
Who do you worry about?

17:17.416 --> 17:19.682
We gave a promise to Suleyman Shah once.

17:20.949 --> 17:23.882
If he had any boys as grandchildren
we promised we name them...

17:23.982 --> 17:26.549
...Gunduz, Savci and Osman.

17:27.749 --> 17:29.649
That will happen as well, if God permits.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.949
Blessed boys and girls
will bring joy to our marquee.

17:34.649 --> 17:38.616
As I said before, Bey.
I do not worry for myself.

17:40.516 --> 17:42.682
Then, who do you worry about
my gazelle eyes?

17:46.482 --> 17:47.582
For our baby, Gunduz.

17:57.716 --> 17:59.082
I am pregnant, Ertugrul.

18:02.516 --> 18:03.782
We are going to have a child.

18:07.616 --> 18:09.782
If my dream was right,
I will give you a son.

18:21.649 --> 18:22.916
Thank God!

18:24.082 --> 18:28.382
Blue sky above and the black soil below,
bear witness to me!

18:28.482 --> 18:30.782
I am going to be a father! Father!

18:30.882 --> 18:32.716
Stop. Calm yourself. It is too early.

18:34.649 --> 18:38.982
How can I be calm, my gazelle eyes?
Our people were looking forward for this.

18:42.582 --> 18:45.549
I wish, Suleyman Shah was here as well.

18:45.816 --> 18:47.382
He would have been so happy.

18:52.749 --> 18:57.949
Neither in the winter hold that we are
about to reach, nor in many others...

19:00.082 --> 19:03.816
...do not make your son cry while asking
his father's whereabouts, Ertugrul.

19:07.316 --> 19:11.516
I cannot know the life that God
gave me or what lies in my destiny...

19:12.382 --> 19:16.616
...however, as long as I am alive
I will not let you or my child...

19:16.716 --> 19:23.449
...go through pain or hardship.
Rest assured about that, Halime Sultan.

19:25.382 --> 19:26.949
May God keep you beside me.

19:44.582 --> 19:45.682
It ends here, Turk.

19:51.016 --> 19:53.749
If you wish your wife to live,
surrender yourself!

19:54.316 --> 19:57.049
It is my last warning to you,
be sure of that, son of Bey!

19:57.116 --> 19:59.316
Run to the horses
and don't look back, Halime.

19:59.416 --> 20:02.016
Inform my brother Gundogdu
to change the caravan's path.

20:02.116 --> 20:04.049
They need to come, help us.
Halime, run!

20:10.649 --> 20:13.416
Do not let that whore escape, go!

23:46.916 --> 23:49.016
Come to me, embarrassment of Kayi!

23:59.982 --> 24:03.549
Neither you nor the ones left
from your nomad group will be able to...

24:03.616 --> 24:05.516
...reach the winter hold, Ertugrul.

24:06.916 --> 24:08.649
None of you will be spared!

24:38.849 --> 24:41.082
Do not let him escape! Go!

24:45.882 --> 24:46.882
Go!

27:02.449 --> 27:04.382
I will kill you, whore!

31:44.749 --> 31:46.482
Do not kill him!

31:47.916 --> 31:49.416
Bey Noyan wants him alive.

34:45.882 --> 34:47.016
Gunduz.

34:49.782 --> 34:50.882
My Gunduz.

34:57.716 --> 34:59.849
I will not let anything happen to you.

36:01.966 --> 36:05.533
-Finally our paths have crossed, Ertugrul.
-Degenerate dogs!

36:11.145 --> 36:14.211
All of your caravan tasted our weapons.

36:17.045 --> 36:21.378
Kill me as well.
Otherwise, even death will not free you!

36:23.278 --> 36:24.278
Alright.

36:32.611 --> 36:34.111
Noyan wants you alive.

36:35.478 --> 36:37.078
You should be thankful to him.

36:37.478 --> 36:40.078
You were the dogs of my ancestor
Oghuz once.

36:42.711 --> 36:47.378
Russia, China, India.

36:48.178 --> 36:50.511
All the lands
that Euphrates and Tigris quench...

36:50.611 --> 36:54.211
...are now property of
Genghis Khan's son Ogeday!

36:56.111 --> 36:57.645
Anatolia is next.

36:58.811 --> 37:02.245
You arrived at the last
point that you are able to go...

37:02.378 --> 37:04.345
...with your few tents and little herds.

37:04.445 --> 37:08.045
There is no way to run away from
Genghis Khan's army!

37:09.311 --> 37:15.278
It is over. Do you understand me, Turk?
It is over.

37:16.811 --> 37:19.678
These lands are the regions that
raise brave men.

37:22.145 --> 37:23.811
We die with pleasure.

37:26.145 --> 37:29.611
However, we do not give up
on even an inch of our land.

37:38.445 --> 37:41.811
We will make you bleed in Anatolia,
bleed!

37:43.745 --> 37:47.078
Then, you will understand
the might of the Mongols!

37:50.678 --> 37:53.578
Get ready, you lazy men!
We are leaving!

38:57.545 --> 38:58.545
Aktolga!

39:02.045 --> 39:03.045
Ertugrul!

39:07.278 --> 39:08.278
Ertugrul!

39:16.245 --> 39:17.745
God, please give me strength.

40:23.378 --> 40:24.778
What is happening, Kaya?

40:27.311 --> 40:29.178
Aytolun Hatun asked us to move these.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.178
Open the chests.

40:38.778 --> 40:42.378
I do not repeat an order in this nomad
group, do you not understand that?

40:50.311 --> 40:51.311
Open it!

41:13.311 --> 41:14.778
Take them back inside. Now.

41:35.611 --> 41:39.211
I am glad that you let me move your
deceased wife's belongings.

41:41.678 --> 41:43.811
You should know that I respect her deeply.

41:44.778 --> 41:48.811
However, I am the Hanim of this
marquee now.

41:51.178 --> 41:56.611
If I am not accepted in this marquee,
how can I make people listen to me?

42:00.378 --> 42:02.311
The woman who gave me life once again.

42:02.845 --> 42:06.478
You are the Sultan of both my marquee
and my heart.

42:13.745 --> 42:16.211
What is this impertinence of yours,
Tugtekin?

42:16.411 --> 42:20.545
Impertinence is erasing my mother's
memory from this marquee, Bey.

42:22.045 --> 42:25.478
On what terms, are you able
to advise me? Know your place!

42:27.345 --> 42:28.345
Father...

42:29.678 --> 42:33.745
...as long as I breathe, those cannot be
removed from this marquee.

42:40.111 --> 42:45.445
Then, you should know this, even the one
who goes against my will is my child...

42:45.711 --> 42:47.511
...I will stop them from breathing!

42:48.778 --> 42:51.345
Bey. Let me.

42:56.311 --> 43:02.611
If our son Tugtekin wishes his mother's
memory to linger in this marquee...

43:05.111 --> 43:06.645
...we should respect his wish.

43:08.411 --> 43:12.645
We should respect him
so our son Tugtekin...

43:12.745 --> 43:16.078
...would respect his Mother Aytolun as well.

43:24.245 --> 43:26.845
Is there any news from
your Aunt Hayme's nomad group?

43:29.078 --> 43:30.278
They will arrive soon.

43:40.478 --> 43:44.411
Tugtekin cannot accept me yet, Bey.
It is not easy.

43:45.311 --> 43:47.678
However, do not worry.

43:49.278 --> 43:53.711
He will accept me as a mother.
I will do everything I can.

43:57.611 --> 44:00.045
Please, do not suffer for this as well.

44:01.311 --> 44:03.711
You have the burden of your people on
your shoulders.

44:07.578 --> 44:10.678
As long as you stand beside me
like this, Hatun...

44:11.545 --> 44:14.211
...I will never bow to anyone,
be sure of that.

45:45.345 --> 45:49.178
God is immortal. God is the one.

47:06.445 --> 47:07.578
My dear Mother.

47:11.211 --> 47:13.078
I wish I had died instead, Mother.

47:16.811 --> 47:18.645
Without you, our nomad group...

47:18.745 --> 47:21.411
...this homeland has become
a dungeon for me, Mother.

47:23.111 --> 47:25.111
The nomad group once
you spread joy all over...

47:26.278 --> 47:28.245
...is now the homeland of dreadful owls.

47:29.678 --> 47:32.511
Death claimed you before
you could see me getting married.

47:37.045 --> 47:39.211
I could not make you hold your grandchild.

47:42.778 --> 47:44.445
That gives me too much pain.

47:50.078 --> 47:51.545
But I miss you deeply, Mother.

47:53.445 --> 47:54.445
Miss you deeply.

47:57.711 --> 48:03.411
Even if my spear shatters hearts, even
if my sword makes my enemies kneel...

48:04.678 --> 48:07.278
...even if I gain many victories and honor...

48:09.511 --> 48:12.545
...when you do not witness them
what good is it, my dear Mother?

48:36.645 --> 48:39.445
So, this is the syrup that
makes a man a raging bull?

48:41.178 --> 48:44.345
If he hears that I have done this,
Artuk Bey would kill me, Hanim.

48:45.845 --> 48:48.111
As long as I am here,
no one can touch you.

48:49.378 --> 48:53.611
Korkut Bey gets joyful nights thanks to
you, is that wrong?

49:03.278 --> 49:04.478
Artuk Bey.

49:08.411 --> 49:11.611
God bless.
You trained Belkis Hatun well.

49:14.845 --> 49:17.145
She became as skillful as you at her job.

49:17.245 --> 49:21.511
If God permits, her heart will be as pure
as her hands, Aytolun Hatun.

49:22.578 --> 49:25.111
I wish that I knew you were coming.

49:25.211 --> 49:27.211
We would provide remedy
to your worries.

49:28.411 --> 49:31.211
Thank God. I have no illness.

49:32.045 --> 49:33.178
I was passing by.

49:34.478 --> 49:39.111
I wanted to ask for womanly
advice from Belkis Hatun.

49:44.078 --> 49:45.845
I hope that you have
found your cure then.

50:12.211 --> 50:13.678
I hope everything is alright.

50:44.645 --> 50:46.178
Kayis are coming!

50:58.835 --> 51:01.501
Kaya? What is happening?

51:01.601 --> 51:05.135
Kayis, Bey.
They are coming to our nomad group.

52:19.168 --> 52:22.401
-What is wrong, Aytolun Hatun?
-Everything, Artuk Bey.

52:23.414 --> 52:26.848
Tell them to start the preparations in
the healing tent.

52:27.281 --> 52:28.881
I smell trouble in the air.

52:29.281 --> 52:31.814
Hurry up and help the wounded. Hurry.

53:07.381 --> 53:09.881
Hayme Hatun! My God!

53:21.418 --> 53:24.018
-Brother.
-Sister, what happened to you?

53:25.518 --> 53:28.151
We were raided. Mongols.

53:29.818 --> 53:33.784
-We are in pieces, brother.
-Damn. Kaya!

53:34.184 --> 53:36.751
-Yes, Bey.
-Inform Tugtekin Bey.

53:36.851 --> 53:37.851
As you wish, Bey.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.451
-Wild Demir.
-Artuk Bey.

53:42.818 --> 53:45.884
Artuk Bey. Save my daughter. Cure her.

53:57.451 --> 53:58.451
Hurry!

54:02.884 --> 54:05.151
In God's name. Go.

54:06.018 --> 54:07.018
Slowly.

54:14.411 --> 54:18.478
-Ertugrul, Gundogdu, where are they?
-Ertugrul and Halime.

54:18.578 --> 54:21.311
While we were
resting they went to the woods...

54:21.411 --> 54:24.078
...and Gundogdu was gathering the caravan.

54:24.811 --> 54:27.411
We did not understand what happened.
We were ruined.

54:27.678 --> 54:29.611
I do not know who is dead
and who is alive.

54:32.844 --> 54:34.944
Alright. Come. Let us go to the marquee.

54:35.511 --> 54:37.778
-They will take care of them.
-Sister Hayme, come.

55:15.247 --> 55:19.147
-Mother!
-Bring some water, Bacis.

55:39.013 --> 55:42.813
-Hayme, where did they attack?
-At the Cortuk Bosporus, brother.

55:43.880 --> 55:49.180
I had never seen them so crowded.
Some of them attacked the Alps...

55:50.047 --> 55:56.113
...and the others attacked women and
children.

55:58.247 --> 56:03.113
They were so blinded with anger.
They attacked like hungry wolves.

56:03.247 --> 56:06.147
Kayi tent has battled many times.

56:06.647 --> 56:13.280
However, we have never seen such
pillage and cruelty, brother.

56:18.647 --> 56:22.947
Our women and children fought back
with weapons.

56:23.147 --> 56:28.013
They battled courageous just like
their men, brothers and sons.

56:28.747 --> 56:32.947
However, most people could not
escape death.

56:35.280 --> 56:40.013
This means that the Moguls attacked
earlier than we expected.

56:41.580 --> 56:43.880
Difficult days await us from now on.

56:57.213 --> 57:02.247
Welcome, Mother. Aunt, I heard the
news. I am very sorry.

57:02.913 --> 57:06.980
-What is the situation?
-Tugtekin, my swarthy nephew.

57:07.180 --> 57:09.213
Thank you.

57:10.713 --> 57:12.147
The Moguls.

57:18.847 --> 57:22.347
I swear to God that I will make life a
living hell for those

57:22.580 --> 57:23.880
who have done this to you.

57:24.247 --> 57:29.213
Your Ertugrul brother and Gundogdu
brother will defeat them, if God permits.

57:29.747 --> 57:32.247
Of course, Aunt. Of course.

57:33.713 --> 57:35.747
What they said was true, father.

57:36.013 --> 57:39.213
They did not send the best Ogeday of
Genghis Khan for nothing.

57:39.280 --> 57:43.080
If they come, they will see, son.

58:04.547 --> 58:05.947
Halime?

58:09.180 --> 58:10.747
Ertugrul?

58:23.847 --> 58:25.280
Halime?

58:51.980 --> 58:53.347
Daughter?

58:53.713 --> 58:56.180
-Halime?
-Halime, what happened to you?

58:59.047 --> 59:02.047
Halime, tell us what happened, daughter.

59:04.147 --> 59:05.813
The Moguls...

59:09.013 --> 59:11.747
Ertugrul and I were riding our horses,
mother.

59:13.280 --> 59:19.013
We came across with them.
Ertugrul sent me to inform you.

59:19.080 --> 59:22.980
-Where is Ertugrul?
-He was battling with them.

59:23.613 --> 59:28.847
I fought with the Moguls while escaping.
I managed to kill them and escape.

59:34.247 --> 59:36.180
Halime!

59:43.547 --> 59:46.847
Bring some water! Give her some water!

59:50.180 --> 59:51.713
Drink.

59:51.980 --> 59:55.080
Drink, Halime. Drink, honey.

00:59:56.947 --> 01:00:01.580
Not to worry. Ertugrul Bey is not
frightened off by those dogs.

01:00:02.047 --> 01:00:06.813
Tell us, come on.
-Daughter...

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:12.547
I did not know what to do when I saw the
caravan burned and overthrown.

01:00:13.947 --> 01:00:16.980
I went to the last place I saw Ertugrul.

01:00:22.647 --> 01:00:26.880
Halime? What did you see?

01:00:29.347 --> 01:00:33.280
Ertugrul had killed many of them.

01:00:36.913 --> 01:00:38.780
Ertugrul?

01:00:40.747 --> 01:00:43.347
I found his horse, not my man, mother.

01:00:46.313 --> 01:00:52.113
I did not see Ertugrul either alive
or dead.

01:01:35.613 --> 01:01:37.913
<i>We did not stop anywhere.</i>

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.747
<i>We haven't seen the light of day either</i>
 <i>during summer or in winter.</i>

01:01:40.813 --> 01:01:42.813
<i>It will be easy after this winter.</i>

01:01:43.147 --> 01:01:45.213
<i>There won't be anything to worry about</i>
 <i>anymore.</i>

01:01:45.313 --> 01:01:49.313
<i>-I don't worry about myself.</i>
 <i>-Who are you worried about?</i>

01:01:49.547 --> 01:01:55.980
<i>For our baby, Gunduz.</i>
 <i>I am pregnant, Ertugrul.</i>

01:01:56.047 --> 01:01:58.280
<i>I will give birth to your son.</i>

01:01:58.913 --> 01:02:01.213
<i>You shall not make him cry</i>

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.980
<i>because of longing for his father</i>
 <i>anywhere.</i>

01:02:14.213 --> 01:02:20.047
God! Do not let me die before
taking my revenge.

01:02:57.113 --> 01:02:58.813
Dear God.

01:02:59.347 --> 01:03:03.913
You are the one who granted
Ismail to Abraham.

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:09.847
You are the one who returns Joseph
to Jacob.

01:03:17.347 --> 01:03:23.147
Please grant my daughter, my only
reason for living.

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:29.347
Do not make me live without her
in this world.

01:04:03.347 --> 01:04:09.013
-God damn you! Blast you!
-Kill them all!

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.213
Stop! Stop my brothers.

01:04:17.047 --> 01:04:21.680
Stop! Don't do it!
We need this dog alive.

01:04:26.713 --> 01:04:30.013
Do not do it! We need him alive.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:12.280
-Hamza, you're responsible for this dog.
-I will, Bey.

01:05:12.347 --> 01:05:13.947
We must make him talk.

01:05:19.847 --> 01:05:21.547
Mother!

01:05:23.547 --> 01:05:24.980
My son!

01:05:25.047 --> 01:05:26.947
Thank God, you are alive.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.113
Thank God, Bey. You are here.

01:05:32.347 --> 01:05:33.813
Welcome, son.

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:46.580
-Where is my brother?
-We do not know where Ertugrul is, son.

01:05:46.647 --> 01:05:51.147
-Halime and Ertugrul were ambushed.
-Hamza! Prepare the Alps.

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.347
We will set off to look for my brother.

01:05:54.247 --> 01:05:58.080
-Turgut, Dogan, where are they?
-No news from any of them, son.

01:05:58.147 --> 01:06:03.047
Come, get in the marquee.
We shall regroup and act accordingly.

01:06:14.247 --> 01:06:16.047
Gundogdu brother.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.247
-How are you, brother?
-Get well soon, brother.

01:06:20.313 --> 01:06:21.747
Thank you.

01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:24.247
We can learn where they are from
this dog.

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:28.247
You shall rest at the marquee.
I will take care of him.

01:06:28.313 --> 01:06:29.980
Come on, let's go.

01:07:05.113 --> 01:07:09.780
I will break your fingers one by one
until you tell me where Noyan is.

01:07:14.713 --> 01:07:20.880
Then, I'll break your feet and won't stop
you until fall to the ground.

01:07:37.013 --> 01:07:40.647
Kocabash, inform me when he comes to.

01:07:40.747 --> 01:07:42.247
As you command, Bey.

01:08:12.113 --> 01:08:15.080
You will heal in a couple of days,
Halime Hatun.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.113
Thank you, Aytolun Hanim.

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:40.647
He blacked out, I mean the snake.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.813
We should make him talk before
taking the road, father.

01:08:44.113 --> 01:08:46.613
It is obvious from his eyes that
he knows something.

01:08:47.913 --> 01:08:50.280
What is the latest situation, Gundogdu?

01:08:53.647 --> 01:08:57.547
We have a lot of martyrs, uncle. A lot.

01:08:57.613 --> 01:09:03.180
The Ignoble! We can't find peace until
we find and kill that heretic Noyan.

01:09:03.747 --> 01:09:05.347
We must make him pay for what
he has done.

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:19.013
Did your attacker have a shaved head
and braided hair?

01:09:20.613 --> 01:09:22.347
Yes, he had, Korkut Bey.

01:09:25.247 --> 01:09:29.347
This means Noyan wanted Ertugrul alive.

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:34.547
How do you know this, Bey?

01:09:34.613 --> 01:09:40.980
Some of the army attacked the caravan.
Some of them chased Ertugrul.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:48.313
So, they know him. Noyan sent his most
trustworthy man after him.

01:09:50.547 --> 01:09:54.646
-So, they were after us for a long time.
-Yes.

01:09:58.347 --> 01:10:02.913
The Moguls want to know their enemies
closely like jackals.

01:10:03.013 --> 01:10:06.213
They set traps and attack accordingly.

01:10:06.913 --> 01:10:10.947
And they never enter a war when they
know that they will lose.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.747
So, what are we going to do, brother?

01:10:36.013 --> 01:10:38.613
Try to get information from that Mogul.

01:10:39.313 --> 01:10:42.080
Who knows where Noyan is...

01:10:43.713 --> 01:10:47.713
However, we must find Ertugrul first.

01:10:50.047 --> 01:10:54.580
Tugtekin, prepare the Alps and explore.

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:05.347
If they took my son like you said,

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.547
will they let him live, Brother?

01:11:31.747 --> 01:11:37.547
-Brother.
-Thank you. I will be back after eating.

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.880
Do not think about it.
I will do what needs to be done.

01:11:50.347 --> 01:11:53.313
Water? Give me some water.

01:12:21.847 --> 01:12:23.547
Who are you?

01:12:28.147 --> 01:12:30.580
Are you the father of that burn victim?

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.847
What did you want from women
and children?

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.980
Weren't the Alps enough?

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.747
We wanted to taste them all.

01:13:00.013 --> 01:13:02.280
Old man, leave him.

01:13:31.847 --> 01:13:35.680
Old man, leave him.
You will get me into trouble.

01:13:48.947 --> 01:13:50.613
Master!

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.613
-Father?
-My son! Thank God, you are alive.

01:14:30.713 --> 01:14:32.547
Where is Aykiz, father?

01:14:35.547 --> 01:14:37.113
Where is Aykiz?

01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:42.080
Father, tell me, where is Aykiz?

01:14:43.113 --> 01:14:48.747
Turgut Alp. Go to the healing tent.

01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:21.247
-What is the situation, Dogan?
-It is bad, Bey.

01:15:22.147 --> 01:15:25.747
We gathered the people.
However, we've lost many lives.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.913
It was a blood bath.

01:15:30.247 --> 01:15:32.647
What is wrong with Aykiz Baci?

01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:35.313
They burned her, Dogan.

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:44.813
We must find Ertugrul immediately.

01:15:45.747 --> 01:15:50.280
-Is Bey not here?
-He is not.

01:16:00.047 --> 01:16:03.680
-Stop, you cannot enter. It is private.
-She is my wife.

01:16:05.113 --> 01:16:07.280
It is still better if you do not enter.

01:16:42.747 --> 01:16:44.547
My God!

01:17:07.913 --> 01:17:11.580
<i>Does one need a new country</i>
 <i>for a good life?</i>

01:17:12.113 --> 01:17:18.613
<i>A new country means a good life</i>
 <i>for all of us. Mostly for us.</i>

01:17:23.747 --> 01:17:27.913
What have they done to you?
What have they done to you?

01:17:33.613 --> 01:17:40.613
My God!
Almighty God!

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:57.313
We shouldn't have left them alone when
they went to find water for the animals.

01:17:58.647 --> 01:18:00.280
Do not lose hope, Dogan.

01:18:00.347 --> 01:18:03.247
Ertugrul Bey is not easily frightened off
by them.

01:18:03.813 --> 01:18:05.880
Mother Hayme and Korkut Bey
are having a meeting.

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:08.247
With God's help, we will overcome
these troubles, too.

01:18:18.813 --> 01:18:22.213
Haven't I told you not to leave that
Mogul alone?

01:18:23.547 --> 01:18:27.113
You have, Bey. But Kocabas was with him.

01:18:27.213 --> 01:18:29.747
-Are you still talking?
-Bey, please, forgive him.

01:18:29.813 --> 01:18:31.613
He has made a mistake.

01:18:39.813 --> 01:18:43.147
Prepare the horses. We will take
the road.

01:18:43.747 --> 01:18:47.147
-Did you hear me?
-Of course, Bey.

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:58.013
Things like this happen.

01:19:00.713 --> 01:19:04.680
I do not deserve this, brothers.
I do not.

01:19:07.947 --> 01:19:09.180
Hamza!

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.147
You know he likes you.

01:19:13.213 --> 01:19:18.747
Bey does not appreciate those who
likes him, Selcan Hatun.

01:19:19.013 --> 01:19:21.047
He does not appreciate.

01:20:01.113 --> 01:20:03.647
It is heavy, right Halime?

01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:09.013
Must be very painful.

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.547
What do you want to say, Gokche?

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:25.113
I lost Ertugrul a thousand times.

01:20:28.147 --> 01:20:31.113
Every time he was dead to me.

01:20:34.047 --> 01:20:35.847
And he came back to life again.

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:45.747
I suffered a lot every time he died
and came back to life.

01:20:47.313 --> 01:20:50.280
You still haven't given up on this love,
Gokce?

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.647
You only hoodwinked and kept quiet.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.147
Halime...

01:21:02.047 --> 01:21:06.780
It's been a long since I closed my eyes
and swallowed my tongue.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:13.147
You should think about what you
are going to do now.

01:21:15.547 --> 01:21:17.647
If he dies...

01:21:19.013 --> 01:21:23.847
...I will not live. Not to worry.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:13.113
I was told that you were tough.
But you fell into our hands rather easily.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.680
Stay alert.

01:23:17.847 --> 01:23:20.813
Don't choke on what you're eating.

01:23:24.613 --> 01:23:31.613
I didn't choke on the likes of you while
I was burning Samarkand and Buhari.

01:23:32.613 --> 01:23:34.747
You cannot even be a fish bone on
my throat.

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:39.547
If a Turk hasn't drawn his last breath,
the last words haven't been spoken yet.

01:23:41.847 --> 01:23:47.147
I will not ask for mercy before the angel
of death comes to take my life.

01:23:49.247 --> 01:23:52.847
-Save it for Noyan.
-Who is Noyan?

01:23:52.913 --> 01:23:55.180
He is the one who wants you alive.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.080
Come on! We are leaving!.

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:14.213
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.847
Welcome Bey. Come on in.

01:25:15.913 --> 01:25:19.013
-Do you have food?
-We have blanching and bread, Bey.

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:23.113
-Did you put zither and thyme, too?
-Of course, Bey.

01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:27.913
-A little bit of garlic?
-You are a gourmet.

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:33.547
If you travel for years, you need to
become a gourmet.

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:37.780
So, Bey. What makes you travel like this?

01:25:39.113 --> 01:25:43.547
The urge of possession, innkeeper.
The urge of possession.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.347
What do you want to possess?

01:25:48.347 --> 01:25:50.347
Everything you see.

01:26:02.213 --> 01:26:06.680
They say the Mogul vanguards entered
our lands after Khwarazmshah's defeat.

01:26:06.747 --> 01:26:10.113
They are led by a butcher called Noyan.

01:26:10.213 --> 01:26:12.847
That ignoble dogs have not seen
soldiers for years.

01:26:12.913 --> 01:26:14.980
They have become crueler in time.

01:26:15.047 --> 01:26:18.280
Sultan Aladdin will teach them
how to battle.

01:26:19.547 --> 01:26:22.880
The cruelty of that butcher Noyan is
well-known.

01:26:22.947 --> 01:26:28.847
That bounder destroyed our brothers
in Khurasan, Samarkand and Bihari.

01:26:28.913 --> 01:26:32.580
He burned and destroyed everything.
He raped our sisters.

01:26:32.647 --> 01:26:35.313
We will battle him and take our revenge
one day.

01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:39.080
What would you do if you saw him?

01:26:39.547 --> 01:26:42.880
I'd love to rip his head off
with this knife.

01:26:48.713 --> 01:26:53.947
-This will eventually happen one day.
-I hope very soon, with God's help.

01:26:55.947 --> 01:27:00.613
-Do you want it to happen soon?
-I want to kill that ignoble the sooner.

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.246
Are you ready Ulubilge?

01:31:10.113 --> 01:31:12.713
You asked for it and now you got it.

01:31:12.913 --> 01:31:15.713
You are one of the beloved subjects of
Tengri.

01:31:17.647 --> 01:31:19.313
You must be happy.

01:32:35.047 --> 01:32:38.113
Good. Very good.

01:32:38.913 --> 01:32:41.680
However, there is something else in this.

01:32:42.547 --> 01:32:45.713
Turmeric.

01:32:47.013 --> 01:32:50.213
Turmeric, Bey. It is turmeric.

01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.947
Good. I'll give you that.

01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:09.647
I do not like sleeping alone at nights,
innkeeper. You understand me, right?

01:33:11.013 --> 01:33:12.347
Good.

01:33:12.947 --> 01:33:16.347
So, you can find me a beautiful woman,
can't you?

01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:23.980
-Do you have a daughter?
-I do not have a daughter.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.113
This is too bad, old man.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.980
Father! Father!

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:37.047
No, no! Father.

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.913
I'll make do with you for
a couple of days.

01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:44.880
I will wait for the guest Ertugrul, here.

01:33:52.013 --> 01:33:56.713
These Turks do not know their friends
from their enemies, soldier.

01:33:58.147 --> 01:34:01.913
Take the bodies to the yard.
Close the doors of the caravansary

01:34:02.247 --> 01:34:06.047
I will wait for Tangut, here.
Put guards on everywhere.

01:34:07.747 --> 01:34:10.680
-Prepare her.
-As you command, Bey.

01:34:35.719 --> 01:34:38.759
Kayis will see
how courageous you are.

01:34:38.879 --> 01:34:42.959
You would seek danger without
batting an eye to find Ertugrul.

01:34:44.079 --> 01:34:46.919
It is my duty to help anyone
who is in trouble.

01:34:48.599 --> 01:34:49.599
It is so.

01:34:50.799 --> 01:34:54.319
However, your altruism
becomes more valuable

01:34:54.639 --> 01:34:57.159
if it's Ertugrul who is in trouble.

01:34:58.679 --> 01:35:01.279
See? Ertugrul's reputation

01:35:01.399 --> 01:35:03.679
has reached everywhere
from Genghis Khan's palace

01:35:03.799 --> 01:35:05.759
to Konya, Damascus
and Constantine.

01:35:09.639 --> 01:35:14.519
You are as courageous as he is
and even more intelligent.

01:35:19.679 --> 01:35:21.639
Why are you telling me all this?

01:35:22.799 --> 01:35:27.679
Because, mothers want their sons to
become famous and become Beys, son.

01:35:31.159 --> 01:35:32.639
That's why.

01:36:02.439 --> 01:36:04.319
If only I could come with you, brother.

01:36:06.559 --> 01:36:07.799
Don't leave our sister alone.

01:36:08.319 --> 01:36:10.639
We'll do whatever is necessary, brother.

01:36:12.479 --> 01:36:13.639
Godspeed, sons.

01:36:16.279 --> 01:36:17.319
Dogan?

01:36:19.119 --> 01:36:20.479
Don't come back unless you find our Bey.

01:36:30.479 --> 01:36:31.599
Godspeed you!

01:36:48.079 --> 01:36:50.279
This is where Ertugrul and
Halime Sultan were attacked.

01:36:52.079 --> 01:36:55.719
We'll take three different routes.
Gundogdu and I will be in the middle.

01:36:55.919 --> 01:36:58.599
And mounted troops will follow us
from left and right.

01:36:58.719 --> 01:37:01.759
In case of an attack, they'll support us
and provide our security.

01:37:05.439 --> 01:37:07.039
Which tracker are you with?

01:37:07.399 --> 01:37:09.679
The best ones, father.
Samca and Bogac.

01:37:10.319 --> 01:37:11.319
And my Alp Kocabas.

01:37:11.559 --> 01:37:13.999
I also took the best with me, uncle.
Not to worry.

01:37:17.959 --> 01:37:19.919
Noyan has arrived with vanguards
from Tabriz.

01:37:20.039 --> 01:37:23.919
He aims to gather information and to be
prepared for the real attack.

01:37:24.199 --> 01:37:25.999
You must be very careful.

01:37:28.519 --> 01:37:31.599
May God help you.
Blessed be our holy war!

01:37:31.719 --> 01:37:34.519
Do your best, and with God's help
you'll achieve victory.

01:37:34.639 --> 01:37:37.839
-Thank you, uncle. Excuse me.
-Thank you, my courageous son.

01:37:41.239 --> 01:37:42.239
Give me your blessings, father.

01:37:48.719 --> 01:37:50.119
I give you my blessings,
my courageous son.

01:37:52.119 --> 01:37:53.119
Excuse me.

01:38:05.519 --> 01:38:07.199
Why are you so late?

01:38:09.199 --> 01:38:10.199
I am sorry, Bey.

01:38:11.359 --> 01:38:15.439
-Who is this, brother?
-He is one of Ertugrul's Alps.

01:38:19.799 --> 01:38:21.799
I'm risking the lives of my men
to find your Bey.

01:38:24.559 --> 01:38:26.319
I won't accept any mistakes.
Keep that in mind.

01:38:27.599 --> 01:38:30.239
Not to worry, Bey.
We'll do our best.

01:38:32.359 --> 01:38:35.479
We have full confidence in him.
You can trust him, too.

01:38:37.999 --> 01:38:39.559
If you vouch for him, brother...

01:39:52.399 --> 01:39:54.759
I am very upset about what happened,
Selcan.

01:39:56.759 --> 01:39:57.959
Thank you, Aytolun.

01:39:58.599 --> 01:40:01.519
I've heard you lost three of
your children.

01:40:01.639 --> 01:40:04.799
Your weak body
couldn't carry the babies.

01:40:06.559 --> 01:40:10.559
The happiness and peace of
a woman stems from giving birth

01:40:10.679 --> 01:40:12.319
to her husband's children.

01:40:14.359 --> 01:40:19.999
-It hurts me to see you like this.
-It was God's will, Ayrolun.

01:40:22.559 --> 01:40:23.679
Without any doubt.

01:40:26.719 --> 01:40:29.399
You must never worry about others

01:40:31.199 --> 01:40:34.199
You look very well.

01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:38.079
You had no trouble taking your
predecessor's place.

01:40:41.119 --> 01:40:42.199
God bless.

01:40:43.279 --> 01:40:46.239
I was told that you'd become an angel.

01:40:47.799 --> 01:40:52.039
However, the devil won't leave you alone
with that sharp tongue of yours, Selcan.

01:40:53.359 --> 01:40:59.279
You should know that
your demons can't run wild here.

01:41:56.959 --> 01:41:59.839
Mighty God who turns the night
into day, and day into night,

01:42:00.879 --> 01:42:04.119
who controls fate and who
dominates time.

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:07.479
Save me from
this contempt soon enough.

01:42:08.159 --> 01:42:11.159
Don't allow me to become desperate
and miserable in front of my enemies.

01:42:11.399 --> 01:42:13.199
Don't let me surrender to the cruel.

01:42:14.119 --> 01:42:19.879
Don't upset my wife, my mother and
my Alps, who are waiting for me, God.

01:42:20.839 --> 01:42:23.639
Give me strength to endure
even if they shred me into pieces,

01:42:23.759 --> 01:42:25.279
Almighty God.

01:42:38.399 --> 01:42:43.999
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't protect my nomad tent.

01:42:46.119 --> 01:42:51.079
Don't talk like that, Hayme.
You stood straight across these jackals.

01:42:51.199 --> 01:42:54.839
They took one life from you,
but you took three.

01:42:56.079 --> 01:42:58.479
The ones they killed were mostly
women and children.

01:42:59.639 --> 01:43:03.759
You put up an excellent fight.
They'll pay for this eventually.

01:43:06.439 --> 01:43:12.159
They burned down everything.
They destroyed our tents and goods.

01:43:13.959 --> 01:43:16.439
They plundered everything we own.

01:43:17.559 --> 01:43:20.959
We're homeless on the brink of winter.

01:43:23.239 --> 01:43:28.599
What am I here for, Hayme?
What are Aytolun and Tugtekin here for?

01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:31.359
This used to be your nomad tent once.

01:43:31.479 --> 01:43:33.319
You are back at your nomad tent
where you were born

01:43:33.439 --> 01:43:34.839
and where you became a bride.

01:43:36.039 --> 01:43:38.599
Thank you, brother.

01:43:40.199 --> 01:43:41.479
I'll never forget your kindness.

01:43:44.439 --> 01:43:46.759
Aytolun had someone set up a tent
for you and your daughters.

01:43:48.119 --> 01:43:49.199
Go and rest.

01:43:50.199 --> 01:43:53.239
We'll take care of the wounded
and the orphans.

01:43:54.679 --> 01:43:56.639
Aytolun will take care of this personally.

01:43:58.599 --> 01:44:00.439
Thank you, Aytolun.

01:44:10.839 --> 01:44:12.719
Bacis! Look here!

01:44:18.199 --> 01:44:21.039
Take Mother Hayme to her tent.
I'll be right with you.

01:44:25.919 --> 01:44:30.159
Hayme Baci, if God permits, everything
will be better soon.

01:44:31.799 --> 01:44:34.519
Tugtekin will find Ertugrul
and bring him back safe and sound.

01:44:38.919 --> 01:44:40.079
Thank you.

01:44:54.399 --> 01:44:56.599
We're done and through with that
in short time.

01:44:58.239 --> 01:44:59.399
Korkut Bey.

01:45:00.039 --> 01:45:01.439
What do you mean, Hatun?

01:45:05.159 --> 01:45:06.599
The Seigniory you wanted to establish.

01:45:07.079 --> 01:45:09.679
The Seigniory that you'd collaborate with
the Kayis to establish.

01:45:10.439 --> 01:45:11.959
Everything turned out in your favor.

01:45:13.799 --> 01:45:16.359
How could you talk about these things
on this painful day, Aytolun?

01:45:18.759 --> 01:45:21.439
On the contrary, it's just about time.

01:45:22.199 --> 01:45:25.199
We'll end up worse than Kayis if
you don't take precautions

01:45:25.319 --> 01:45:26.959
on this painful day.

01:46:13.599 --> 01:46:15.799
The first time I took her into my arms

01:46:18.799 --> 01:46:20.919
I felt as if I was the king of the world.

01:46:28.799 --> 01:46:33.599
What property, what possession
could be more beautiful than that?

01:46:39.919 --> 01:46:41.759
She looked just like her mother.

01:46:45.759 --> 01:46:47.079
After her mother's death

01:46:48.399 --> 01:46:50.279
I took strength from her
beautiful eyes

01:46:51.799 --> 01:46:56.439
her soft words and her brave heart.

01:46:58.879 --> 01:47:02.559
Come on, my daughter.
Come on, open your eyes.

01:47:04.679 --> 01:47:08.839
Open them and bring us back to life.

01:47:11.919 --> 01:47:12.919
If...

01:47:16.959 --> 01:47:18.959
Aykiz becomes a martyr,

01:47:23.279 --> 01:47:27.879
I swear on my life that

01:47:29.359 --> 01:47:33.999
I will wipe them off the earth
and leave no man alive.

01:47:45.479 --> 01:47:48.079
What's the situation, Artuk?

01:47:49.239 --> 01:47:52.159
I've tried every medicine we have, Bey.

01:47:52.839 --> 01:47:55.399
However, the condition of the wounded
is critical.

01:47:55.519 --> 01:47:56.759
Most of them
won't even see tomorrow.

01:47:58.679 --> 01:48:03.559
What happened to them today
might happen to us tomorrow.

01:48:04.279 --> 01:48:05.479
What do you think, Bey?

01:48:08.359 --> 01:48:10.439
I'll send a message to Sultan Aladdin.

01:48:11.199 --> 01:48:13.839
There are no obstacles before the Moguls

01:48:14.119 --> 01:48:15.959
after the defeat of Celaleddin
Khwarazmshah's.

01:48:17.159 --> 01:48:18.559
We must get help from Konya.

01:48:19.719 --> 01:48:22.199
Otherwise,
we can't stop those bandits.

01:48:25.719 --> 01:48:28.959
Bey, Kayis should stay with us
for a while.

01:48:29.439 --> 01:48:31.279
We'll consolidate our strength with them.

01:48:31.999 --> 01:48:34.599
We can gather
the Kayi herd that fell apart

01:48:34.719 --> 01:48:36.279
at the battle and sell them cheaper.

01:48:36.399 --> 01:48:37.919
That way we can buy provisions.

01:48:38.719 --> 01:48:43.159
Winter is coming. The men who
are alive can run our errands.

01:48:51.959 --> 01:48:53.359
That's the right way, Artuk.

01:48:54.999 --> 01:48:58.439
However, I'm not sure how to deal with
the troubles that will come our way.

01:49:00.479 --> 01:49:04.159
If God permits, all the nomad group
will embrace them.

01:49:04.759 --> 01:49:10.519
We'll become brothers just like
Muhacir and Ensar,

01:49:10.999 --> 01:49:14.799
two of the companions of Prophet
Muhammad, who embraced each other.

01:49:29.199 --> 01:49:30.199
Halt!

01:49:50.119 --> 01:49:51.119
My brother is alive.

01:49:53.319 --> 01:49:54.639
Ertugrul is alive.

01:49:55.039 --> 01:49:59.199
He left traces for us.
Let's set off right away!

01:50:00.479 --> 01:50:03.359
They can't be far. They're taking him
somewhere on foot. Come on.

01:51:40.039 --> 01:51:42.559
It's a good thing that
we sent Dundar and Yigit away

01:51:42.679 --> 01:51:44.999
to train to become Alps.

01:51:46.799 --> 01:51:49.679
At least we're not
worrying about them, mother.

01:51:53.399 --> 01:51:57.519
You should know that I'm very proud to
have daughters-in-law like you two.

01:52:03.119 --> 01:52:05.599
They'll find Ertugrul and bring him back,
if God permits.

01:52:05.719 --> 01:52:07.799
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

01:52:08.039 --> 01:52:09.519
We'll pray for it.

01:52:11.599 --> 01:52:16.879
But, we shouldn't lag behind.
Our nomad tent needs us.

01:52:19.879 --> 01:52:24.639
-We'll be there for you, mother.
-I know, my daughter.

01:52:28.639 --> 01:52:33.559
As soon as they assemble at
headquarters we'll decide what to do.

01:52:34.719 --> 01:52:37.279
The nomad group can gather further
down the valley.

01:52:38.439 --> 01:52:42.039
We won't leave them leaderless
because of our sorrow.

01:52:43.599 --> 01:52:44.599
Not to worry, mother.

01:52:54.159 --> 01:52:56.879
-Mother.
-Tell me, daughter.

01:52:59.479 --> 01:53:04.199
-I was going to tell you today,
-What?

01:53:05.119 --> 01:53:06.679
after I told Ertugrul Bey.

01:53:12.639 --> 01:53:13.879
I wanted you to hear this from him.

01:53:16.719 --> 01:53:17.719
Tell me, daughter.

01:53:21.839 --> 01:53:22.839
Is it bad news?

01:53:31.519 --> 01:53:32.519
I'm expecting, mother.

01:53:49.519 --> 01:53:51.599
My God! Thank you.

01:53:53.639 --> 01:53:57.079
My God, you created us
and we will return to you.

01:53:59.999 --> 01:54:02.719
You blessed us with a new life
on our rainy days.

01:54:03.679 --> 01:54:05.519
Don't let him become an orphan,
my God.

01:54:09.439 --> 01:54:10.439
Halime.

01:54:47.959 --> 01:54:52.119
Let's split up here.
They can't be far away.

01:54:53.239 --> 01:54:56.759
Look sharp. We won't go back to the
nomad tent unless we find Ertugrul.

01:57:26.759 --> 01:57:30.359
What's going on?
Did you lose your way?

01:57:31.919 --> 01:57:34.799
Don't you know that if you lose
your way, you can't become an Alp?

01:57:34.919 --> 01:57:37.879
And if you're in over your head,
you're a lost case, Kocabas?

01:57:38.399 --> 01:57:40.999
You should have protected
your Bey instead of talking.

01:57:43.359 --> 01:57:44.639
There are no traces here.

01:57:45.559 --> 01:57:47.919
Look to the other side of the hill.
Make yourself useful.

01:58:26.639 --> 01:58:28.559
There are no traces
below the riverside, Bey.

01:58:29.239 --> 01:58:31.479
It will be more difficult if we
continue tomorrow.

01:58:34.119 --> 01:58:35.119
Bey?

01:58:38.039 --> 01:58:39.119
Unfortunately, there are no traces.

01:58:41.079 --> 01:58:43.079
We shall keep searching
until dark.

01:59:25.479 --> 01:59:26.479
No!

01:59:32.799 --> 01:59:35.199
Sir, your guest has arrived.

01:59:46.839 --> 01:59:50.879
Make do with this for now.
You'll be mine tonight.

02:00:35.719 --> 02:00:40.039
-I'm here, Aykiz.
-Aykiz, my daughter.

02:00:43.439 --> 02:00:46.199
-I'm always with you.
-My daughter.

02:00:50.999 --> 02:00:51.999
Aykiz?

02:00:53.599 --> 02:00:54.799
Aykiz?

02:01:19.039 --> 02:01:20.039
My daughter.

02:01:26.559 --> 02:01:29.039
Aykiz!

02:01:37.319 --> 02:01:38.319
Aykiz!

02:01:41.839 --> 02:01:42.839
Aykiz!

02:01:47.319 --> 02:01:48.639
Aykiz! No!

02:01:52.199 --> 02:01:53.199
Aykiz!

02:01:58.959 --> 02:01:59.959
Aykiz!

02:02:26.199 --> 02:02:28.399
Thankfully, Bamsi took Dundar and
Yigit to the Taurus Mountains

02:02:28.519 --> 02:02:30.199
to be trained as Alps.

02:02:30.759 --> 02:02:34.439
-If he were here...
-It would be a bloodbath, brother.

02:02:43.999 --> 02:02:47.239
I'm tempted to act
as if there's no tomorrow

02:02:47.359 --> 02:02:49.959
and rip off that big head of Kocabas's.

02:02:50.079 --> 02:02:52.519
-Hush! He'll hear you.
-I don't care if he does.

02:02:56.199 --> 02:02:59.879
You should know that the Kayis of
Suleiman Shah are losers.

02:03:01.479 --> 02:03:03.679
They are hirelings and parasites.

02:03:04.279 --> 02:03:06.439
We should talk
very carefully from now on.

02:03:27.519 --> 02:03:29.599
Your Alps are very impatient,
Gundogdu Brother.

02:03:29.919 --> 02:03:32.079
Do they not know we are searching
for a needle in a haystack?

02:03:33.919 --> 02:03:35.919
They're all faithful companions
of Ertugrul.

02:03:38.159 --> 02:03:41.599
Dogan, Bamsi, Turgut.

02:03:43.319 --> 02:03:45.759
Ertugrul considers them as his
own brothers.

02:03:47.439 --> 02:03:49.519
Ertugrul might as well be dead, brother.

02:03:51.639 --> 02:03:53.879
You have no right
to fall into such despair.

02:04:02.079 --> 02:04:05.319
If there's anyone who can help the
nomad tent survive this situation,

02:04:05.439 --> 02:04:07.159
it's you, brother.

02:04:08.079 --> 02:04:10.559
You should know that my father
and I are always here for you.

02:04:12.999 --> 02:04:14.919
Thank you, my nephew. Thank you.

02:04:16.239 --> 02:04:20.639
Like you said, it's time to team up.

02:04:22.119 --> 02:04:26.399
The reason why this happened to us
is because we were no good at this.

02:04:30.199 --> 02:04:32.439
Regarding my brother Ertugrul,

02:04:33.279 --> 02:04:39.079
you don't know him well, my nephew.
He could get through anything.

02:04:39.639 --> 02:04:42.119
He could even fool the devil.

02:04:43.639 --> 02:04:44.919
If God permits, brother.

02:04:45.879 --> 02:04:47.319
Ertugrul is a brave warrior.

02:04:48.839 --> 02:04:51.799
-I hope we'll find him safe and sound.
-If God permits.

02:04:56.359 --> 02:05:01.079
For all I care, we should spend the
winter on the same land.

02:05:02.199 --> 02:05:05.159
We should unite. We have enough water
and we can share our food.

02:05:06.159 --> 02:05:10.079
And we'll stick together against
the Moguls. Winters are harsh here.

02:05:10.759 --> 02:05:12.399
When spring comes, there will be war.

02:05:13.359 --> 02:05:16.479
We can team up with Aladdin's army
and kick the Moguls out of our land.

02:05:16.599 --> 02:05:19.079
-We'll figure out the rest later.
-With God's help.

02:05:20.759 --> 02:05:22.479
Move!

02:05:27.319 --> 02:05:28.319
Move!

02:05:29.919 --> 02:05:33.239
I caught this jackal in the bushes.
I guess he was eavesdropping.

02:05:34.199 --> 02:05:38.479
-Tell me, are you one of Noyan's dogs?
-His name is Geyikli.

02:05:39.279 --> 02:05:41.159
He's a harmless lunatic wanderer.

02:05:42.879 --> 02:05:45.959
However, no one has ever
succeeded in catching him.

02:05:47.639 --> 02:05:50.399
You have sharp ears even though
you're no good at tracing. Good job.

02:05:52.319 --> 02:05:57.199
However, you should know that he's
faster than a deer, craftier than a fox

02:05:57.879 --> 02:06:00.199
and stronger than a bear.
Don't mess with him anymore.

02:06:11.119 --> 02:06:12.319
Excuse me, brother.

02:06:19.599 --> 02:06:21.159
-I'll show you!
-Dogan.

02:06:24.839 --> 02:06:26.199
Come on and eat.

02:06:28.159 --> 02:06:29.799
As you command, Bey.

02:08:38.039 --> 02:08:39.879
I was expecting you, my dear friend.

02:08:43.399 --> 02:08:48.279
-Who the hell are you?
-Welcome to the hell of Noyan, Ertugrul.

02:08:50.919 --> 02:08:56.759
-So, you are the vinedresser, Noyan.
-Yes. I am the hellhound of this hell.

02:10:14.399 --> 02:10:16.879
Bey, smoke is rising from the caravansary.

02:10:19.799 --> 02:10:22.799
I told you!
I did, but you didn't listen.

02:10:22.959 --> 02:10:25.399
I'll make you pay for it
if something happens to my Bey

02:10:25.519 --> 02:10:27.079
because of this bastard, Kocabas.

02:10:27.199 --> 02:10:28.199
Dogan!

02:10:29.919 --> 02:10:34.519
If you keep talking smack,
you'll be back at the nomad tent.

02:10:36.559 --> 02:10:37.799
Mount your horses right away!

02:10:40.039 --> 02:10:41.079
God give me patience!

02:10:53.799 --> 02:10:56.399
Welcome to the world of the Moguls.
