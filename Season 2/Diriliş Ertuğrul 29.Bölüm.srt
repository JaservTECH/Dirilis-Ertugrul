Episode 29 will start after 12:20 min

12:20.058 --> 12:22.858
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:25.099 --> 12:28.123
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:29.205 --> 12:32.013
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:25.483 --> 13:26.983
We are near Noyan's route.

13:29.483 --> 13:30.783
Two people shall scout.

13:32.116 --> 13:33.549
They should be fast and talented.

13:35.049 --> 13:36.483
Abdurrahman, Hamza.

13:39.883 --> 13:41.083
-Yes, Bey.
-Yes, Bey.

13:41.983 --> 13:43.616
You scout before us.

13:44.783 --> 13:47.049
You never know where these infidels
will come from.

13:48.516 --> 13:50.183
We shall not be caught unprepared.

13:51.016 --> 13:52.649
-Your wish is my command, Bey.
-Your wish is my command, Bey.

13:56.549 --> 13:57.549
Come.

14:23.483 --> 14:25.383
Bring me Gundogdu and Tugtekin's head.

14:25.883 --> 14:27.949
No one will get out of here alive. No one!

16:25.149 --> 16:27.683
You should not tire yourself,
Halime Sultan.

16:28.683 --> 16:29.783
You are pregnant.

16:32.716 --> 16:34.449
It feels good to work, Aytolun Hatun.

16:35.749 --> 16:37.449
It is easier to wait for my man this way.

16:38.183 --> 16:41.149
Tugtekin and Gundogdu
will avenge your man.

16:42.183 --> 16:43.816
They are both brave warriors.

17:08.883 --> 17:12.583
Ertugrul, what kind of a warrior was he?

17:15.149 --> 17:16.483
I could not have met him.

17:19.849 --> 17:21.016
Ertugrul...

17:22.549 --> 17:27.483
He was really different
with his friendship

17:29.583 --> 17:30.749
his mirth and sincerity.

17:34.849 --> 17:36.949
Ertugrul was the hope of
our nomad group, Aytolun Hatun.

17:39.449 --> 17:43.083
Ertugrul had been our hope
on our most desperate days.

17:46.683 --> 17:48.849
Ertugrul was the one who pulled
all of us out of

17:49.083 --> 17:51.383
the betrayal that surrounded
Kayis like a wen.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.883
I heard that your sister
was a part of this betrayal

17:58.049 --> 17:59.583
and then she repented.

18:04.616 --> 18:05.649
Gokce Hatun.

18:09.816 --> 18:11.449
Ertugrul is like your brother.

18:17.583 --> 18:19.183
I am sorry for what happened.

18:22.449 --> 18:23.983
May God give you patience.

18:54.449 --> 18:55.716
I know people like you well.

18:57.849 --> 19:00.516
I know well how you carry poison
with your silver tongue.

19:03.416 --> 19:07.816
The sins you committed in the past has
gained you big life experiences, Selcan.

19:10.116 --> 19:14.916
Stay away from our women, especially
my sister Gokce and Halime.

19:15.716 --> 19:18.816
Curb your poisoned tongue
so the winter can pass quickly.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.393
Ertugrul!

21:37.827 --> 21:38.827
Go ahead!

22:03.727 --> 22:05.027
I have a bad feeling.

22:06.027 --> 22:07.993
You cannot escape the fate, Bey.

22:09.827 --> 22:11.027
It is forbidden to me

22:11.793 --> 22:14.860
to leave blood in those infidels' veins

22:16.860 --> 22:17.927
to leave breath in their lungs.

22:19.093 --> 22:21.060
Aburrahman and Hamza
has not come back yet.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.793
Bey, they are coming.

22:27.027 --> 22:28.527
Tugtekin, they are coming!

22:29.027 --> 22:30.227
May God help us.

22:30.393 --> 22:31.960
Thank you. For all of us.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.160
Wait!

24:14.293 --> 24:15.427
Hold your position.

25:16.493 --> 25:18.260
<i>This way! This way!</i>

25:19.527 --> 25:20.893
<i>Find that dog!</i>

25:21.193 --> 25:22.927
<i>Find him or I will kill all of you!</i>

25:23.393 --> 25:25.127
<i>Idiots, go ahead!</i>

25:25.327 --> 25:28.093
We must run away, braveheart.
With your last bit of power.

25:28.393 --> 25:29.527
In the name of God.

26:15.393 --> 26:16.393
It is an ambush!

26:45.260 --> 26:47.327
-Hide!
-Hide!

26:47.860 --> 26:49.260
-Hide!
-Hide!

27:26.860 --> 27:28.093
Strive.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.927
Keep on, brave heart!
Keep on for the love of God!

27:43.127 --> 27:44.427
Go ahead. Go ahead.

27:52.060 --> 27:53.060
This way!

27:56.193 --> 27:58.927
Look at the river! Run to the path there!

28:01.860 --> 28:02.860
Quickly!

28:07.893 --> 28:10.527
-Someone of us entrapped us, brother.
-What are you saying, Tugtekin?

28:10.960 --> 28:12.093
They knew we were here.

28:12.460 --> 28:15.993
Making strawmen, ambush within ambush.
It was all a trap.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.393
Who would do this?

28:25.727 --> 28:27.493
Brother, you better look for the
traitor among your closest Alps.

28:28.493 --> 28:32.127
The Alps who are not with you here now.
Half of mine are dead or hit.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.027
<i>Hamza, watch this dog carefully.</i>

28:36.927 --> 28:38.093
<i>We must make him talk.</i>

28:42.160 --> 28:43.160
<i>Master!</i>

28:44.360 --> 28:46.927
<i>Have I not told you to not to leave</i>
 <i>this Mongol alone?</i>

28:47.227 --> 28:49.493
<i>We saw a Mongol who is watching</i>
 <i>the nomad tent.</i>

28:49.927 --> 28:51.793
<i>-Did you catch him?</i>
 <i>-We did, Mother Hayme.</i>

28:51.993 --> 28:54.793
<i>Before he died, he said,</i>
 <i>Noyan will set off tomorrow.</i>

28:56.160 --> 28:57.193
Hamza.

28:59.927 --> 29:00.927
Hamza.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.327
Leave me here, run away.

29:32.027 --> 29:33.360
You will die because of me.

29:33.893 --> 29:35.893
Trust me. We almost arrived.

29:36.293 --> 29:37.993
Keep on. Go ahead.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.360
Attack!

29:52.127 --> 29:53.127
Attack!

29:53.960 --> 29:55.893
-By God!
-By God!

29:56.060 --> 29:58.293
I want their head! All of them!

30:39.127 --> 30:40.160
God is almighty!

30:40.860 --> 30:41.960
God is the truth!

30:42.460 --> 30:43.727
God is almighty!

31:13.027 --> 31:14.060
This way!

31:17.127 --> 31:21.393
Some more! A couple more steps
and we will arrive.

31:24.193 --> 31:25.193
Go ahead!

33:21.760 --> 33:24.193
The trace is going this way.
Go ahead, quickly!

33:30.060 --> 33:31.060
Wait, wait.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.160
Damn! Where is he?

33:56.160 --> 33:57.927
Where is he? Where?

35:26.227 --> 35:27.493
Move. Move!

35:38.860 --> 35:40.893
I know this man. His name is Bilyu.

35:41.827 --> 35:42.960
He has been lost for hree days, sir.

35:44.927 --> 35:46.260
Then Ertugrul is not alone.

35:48.127 --> 35:52.060
Someone spied our headquarters.
Then took him under his care.

35:54.227 --> 35:56.427
Find him! Find them!

35:57.360 --> 35:58.527
Find them! Move!

35:59.460 --> 36:00.460
Move!

37:40.893 --> 37:43.060
You had endured against these
hellhounds, brave heart.

37:44.760 --> 37:45.927
Be patient for a little longer.

38:03.027 --> 38:04.093
Father, what are you doing here?

38:06.127 --> 38:09.860
From now on I do not have a purpose
other than being a martyr.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.360
Go ahead.

38:28.127 --> 38:29.193
By God!

40:55.793 --> 40:59.227
The decision of spending the winter
together reassured everyone, Hayme.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.293
May God bless you, brother.

41:04.493 --> 41:08.993
But I am thinking about
Gundogdu and Tugtekin.

41:10.427 --> 41:11.827
They are both furious.

41:13.160 --> 41:14.727
They are both fueled with revenge.

41:16.293 --> 41:18.027
I am afraid they will do something bad.

41:19.827 --> 41:20.827
Noyan.

41:22.960 --> 41:25.493
The devil who is against them,
is not to be underestimated.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.060
Our children are the
future of two nomad tents.

41:29.827 --> 41:33.027
They know that. They will err on the
side of caution for it, Hayme.

41:35.460 --> 41:38.060
Gundogdu would not be cheated.

41:41.427 --> 41:42.427
Wild Demir, stop!

41:45.827 --> 41:46.827
Wild Demir, stop!

41:49.293 --> 41:50.527
We need him alive.

41:53.960 --> 41:57.927
We need to find out who ambushed us.
Stop. Do not.

42:03.260 --> 42:04.260
Stop.

42:24.027 --> 42:25.027
Lie down, infidel!

42:45.793 --> 42:47.293
We united two nomad groups.

42:49.893 --> 42:51.760
But this will not be easy, brother.

42:53.527 --> 42:54.960
Why do you think so, Hayme?

42:56.993 --> 43:02.193
Who do you think would be most angry at
two nomad groups spending winter together?

43:03.460 --> 43:04.460
Noyan.

43:07.860 --> 43:13.227
He is going to do everything to bother us
inside and outside.

43:14.493 --> 43:15.960
He is going to engrave us.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.260
And he will not let us breathe
from outside.

43:26.727 --> 43:27.727
Dogan.

43:28.227 --> 43:30.127
Help me.
-Alright, Wild Demir.

43:35.027 --> 43:36.027
Easy.

43:38.327 --> 43:39.327
Easy.

43:55.993 --> 43:57.393
Resist, gallant man, you will be better.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.160
Press it on your wound.

44:05.493 --> 44:07.227
Someone in here betrayed us.

44:09.960 --> 44:11.060
He tattled us to Noyan.

44:13.793 --> 44:17.327
Who would risk being ambushed
and do such a thing?

44:20.427 --> 44:22.093
Maybe the traitor is not here, right now.

44:36.893 --> 44:39.193
Hamza and Abdurrahman went to scout
but they did not come back yet.

44:44.293 --> 44:46.127
They were eager to before us.

44:48.427 --> 44:50.393
It is obvious they knew
that there was a trap.

44:53.127 --> 44:56.227
Ignoble man! Your mouth is
worse than a camel's tripe!

44:56.393 --> 44:57.860
Would a good word ever
come out of your mouth?

45:03.193 --> 45:05.527
Be grateful to your Bey

45:07.193 --> 45:09.460
or I know what I would do to you.
-What will you do to me?

45:10.193 --> 45:11.227
-Dogan!
-Kocabash!

45:22.360 --> 45:23.927
Tugtekin is a brave man.

45:25.793 --> 45:27.727
When I look at him, I see your youth.

45:28.727 --> 45:32.393
But he resembles Ertugrul's old,
petulant times.

45:35.393 --> 45:40.227
Ertugrul learned the art of war
on the lands of hardest enemy.

45:41.527 --> 45:44.760
He learned diplomacy in Aleppo
from his relations with Ayyubids

45:46.393 --> 45:52.360
and the finesse of art of war
from his fight with Templars.

45:53.860 --> 45:59.393
Above all he learned the merit of
recognizing his enemies.

46:02.493 --> 46:05.760
Tugtekin is far away from these
experiences, yet, brother.

46:11.327 --> 46:14.193
Fighting with Mongols
cooked Tugtekin, too, Hayme.

46:15.893 --> 46:16.993
Do not worry.

46:17.893 --> 46:20.327
We will overcome all of it.

46:22.893 --> 46:26.127
In the end, it will not be easy, brother.

46:28.427 --> 46:29.727
It will not be easy.

46:56.327 --> 46:58.360
Bey, I hope you are fine.

47:04.960 --> 47:06.027
Where is ignoble Noyan?

47:11.260 --> 47:12.260
Where have you been?

47:13.393 --> 47:14.927
You sent us off to scout, Bey.

47:22.427 --> 47:23.893
Allow me to question them, brother.

47:26.060 --> 47:27.127
What are you talking about?

47:28.027 --> 47:29.160
What does he say, Bey?

47:32.127 --> 47:33.960
Answer Tugtekin Bey's questions.

47:36.393 --> 47:39.027
Bey, do you know that what you are saying?

47:46.160 --> 47:47.160
My Bey.

47:48.193 --> 47:51.793
-Do not interfere, Wild Demir.
-They are our dear ones, Bey.

47:54.127 --> 47:55.293
So Kurdoglu was.

48:38.827 --> 48:39.960
Keep on, brave heart.

48:41.393 --> 48:43.260
I need to find a way to carry you.

49:12.193 --> 49:13.227
In the name of God.

49:29.227 --> 49:30.793
Two warrior tribes.

49:32.993 --> 49:35.460
Both have brave Alps.

49:37.093 --> 49:41.727
The smallest spark could trigger
a civil war.

49:45.727 --> 49:47.527
That is my biggest fear, brother.

50:59.827 --> 51:00.960
We must obey the order.

51:09.860 --> 51:15.427
Damn with this order
and who obeys this order...

51:28.760 --> 51:31.193
Which one of you tattled us to Noyan?
Which one?

51:32.493 --> 51:33.760
Or was it both of you?

51:36.527 --> 51:38.127
I do not have answer for you!

51:38.926 --> 51:41.060
Call Bey! Call him!

51:42.460 --> 51:43.493
You fool!

51:44.360 --> 51:46.160
Your Bey does not trust you,
do you not see?

51:48.827 --> 51:50.426
You left alone the Mongol
you brought to nomad tent.

51:51.093 --> 51:53.460
You caused Wild Demir to kill him
out of his pain. Why?

51:54.393 --> 51:56.060
Because you did not want him to talk.

51:57.860 --> 51:59.093
Do not try my patience!

52:03.327 --> 52:04.960
You cannot call me traitor!

52:06.727 --> 52:09.127
Why? Or will you tell your master, Noyan?

52:18.227 --> 52:19.227
Enough!

52:27.993 --> 52:31.460
We need to take measures
to prevent this conflict.

52:34.427 --> 52:40.293
Brother, we would not even need Noyan,
for us to be destroyed in such a conflict.

52:41.460 --> 52:43.360
We would do it ourselves.

53:51.827 --> 53:53.393
I want these two to be executed, brother.

54:04.493 --> 54:07.527
Bey, do not do what this tactless said.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.727
Abdurrahman is entrusted
to us by Suleyman Shah.

54:11.227 --> 54:13.160
And Hamza is your bravest Alp.

54:13.727 --> 54:16.160
He put his head in the lion's mouth
for you in many wars.

54:16.893 --> 54:20.460
If you do such a thing,
it would have big consequences.

54:25.493 --> 54:26.493
Thank you.

54:37.093 --> 54:38.160
Do not hurry.

55:17.427 --> 55:19.260
Enough, stop, enough!

55:19.960 --> 55:22.127
Look at this! What happened to the dye!

55:22.527 --> 55:24.427
I told you, woman!
You did not listen to me!

55:24.927 --> 55:26.493
Leave me alone. I do not need your help.

55:26.827 --> 55:28.760
Go away, I can do it myself.
-What is happening here?

55:30.993 --> 55:34.160
Aytolun Hatun, look at this.

55:34.793 --> 55:36.160
She messed up a vessel of dye.

55:36.393 --> 55:39.493
Are they here to help us or to scourge us?

55:40.327 --> 55:42.993
I told her to blend it slowly.
She did not listen to me.

55:44.093 --> 55:45.427
She is no different than a goat.

55:48.127 --> 55:49.460
Enough! I said enough!

55:53.993 --> 55:57.127
She will not listen to you,
you will listen to her.

55:57.993 --> 56:01.793
You will not forget who is landlord
and who is guest here.

56:02.827 --> 56:05.460
If you forget that,
I know how to remind you.

56:13.160 --> 56:14.760
You remind who of what, Aytolun Hanim?

56:21.427 --> 56:24.460
Selcan, I will remind who they are
and where they came from.

56:27.260 --> 56:29.227
Firstly, they are refugees here.

56:29.493 --> 56:31.493
We would die of starvation
than to help them.

56:35.727 --> 56:39.493
If it was not for Korkut Bey,
you would have fallen prey.

56:40.093 --> 56:46.160
No one can disrespect my women
in my sewing workshop.

56:47.127 --> 56:50.427
We do whatever Mother Hayme
taught us, Aytolun Hanim.

56:51.027 --> 56:54.527
She would want us to do our job right,
come hell or high water

56:55.227 --> 56:56.927
even if we die of starvation.

56:58.327 --> 57:00.893
If you put many woods under the boiler
so the herbs in it

57:01.060 --> 57:03.727
could encolour quickly
you cannot get the color.

57:04.227 --> 57:07.193
Even if you do, the color would not be
permanent when the rug is weaved.

57:08.227 --> 57:10.193
You cannot find customers in bazaar.

57:11.060 --> 57:13.960
So, us, Kayi women

57:14.727 --> 57:17.993
would rather not do our job
than to do it deviously.

57:18.793 --> 57:20.060
Think about it.

57:22.060 --> 57:24.760
Ask your Bey and tell us your decision.

57:25.260 --> 57:28.827
If you want, we will come
and do our work right

57:29.327 --> 57:33.360
or you will do your work
as you know, without us.

57:36.027 --> 57:37.227
We are leaving, Hatuns.

58:05.065 --> 58:08.398
I will execute them, brother.
I can't bring trouble into my nomad tent.

58:12.398 --> 58:13.532
Here we are thinking that
you were a decent man.

58:17.532 --> 58:19.598
We thought that
you were to avenge our Bey,

58:19.698 --> 58:21.332
but you turned out to be coward.

58:21.432 --> 58:23.465
-You are a fool and coward.
-Dogan!

58:24.865 --> 58:25.865
What do you think you're doing?

58:27.698 --> 58:29.565
Will we draw a swords against
each other?

58:32.032 --> 58:35.032
Does what you're doing become an Alp?
What kind of a combat is this?

58:43.732 --> 58:44.765
Kocabash!

59:30.098 --> 59:31.398
Stop it, for God's sake!

59:35.332 --> 59:36.332
Stop it!

59:53.565 --> 59:54.865
The head of the Alps is Tugtekin!

59:57.798 --> 59:58.832
You will do as he says!

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:02.865
And that is that!

01:01:11.865 --> 01:01:13.798
-Who is inside?
-Mother Hayme.

01:01:15.665 --> 01:01:17.798
Alright, you can leave.

01:01:30.532 --> 01:01:31.832
What's on your mind, brother?

01:01:32.098 --> 01:01:36.632
We must reinforce our relations as
relatives to prevent such conflicts

01:01:36.732 --> 01:01:38.365
in the future, Hayme.

01:01:39.865 --> 01:01:42.798
Even we are at war,

01:01:42.898 --> 01:01:44.932
we need to cement
the trust between the two tribes

01:01:45.032 --> 01:01:47.732
with weddings and headquarter
meetings.

01:01:50.565 --> 01:01:55.932
The best way is intermarriage among
the two tribes.

01:02:45.098 --> 01:02:47.665
-More power to you!
-Thank you.

01:02:54.832 --> 01:02:57.332
It is high time you got married, Gokche.

01:03:00.798 --> 01:03:02.865
To become a widow like Halime?

01:03:07.665 --> 01:03:09.732
That's God's will, Gokche.

01:03:10.565 --> 01:03:16.632
However, you acting like one of
Ertugrul's widows isn't helping.

01:03:20.732 --> 01:03:25.565
How soon you forget that I am barren
women who cannot even have a baby?

01:03:26.765 --> 01:03:27.998
And it's all because of you.

01:03:30.465 --> 01:03:32.732
Because of your ominous ambitions.

01:03:36.498 --> 01:03:37.565
See?

01:03:39.465 --> 01:03:40.798
I have become just like you.

01:03:42.698 --> 01:03:45.698
I am doomed to live as a barren spinster.

01:03:49.065 --> 01:03:53.732
Tell me. Who will marry me now, sister?
Tell me!

01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:55.732
Gokche.

01:04:35.765 --> 01:04:36.765
Gokche?

01:04:39.598 --> 01:04:42.465
What is the matter with you?
Are you good, sister?

01:04:46.765 --> 01:04:50.132
We must bury our pain deep inside
and keep living.

01:04:51.998 --> 01:04:54.732
The life will show us its blessings.

01:04:57.098 --> 01:05:01.565
Do not let your beautiful eyes
stare only to the ground.

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:03.998
Do not miss out on your kismet.

01:05:05.632 --> 01:05:10.732
Ertugrul was the hope for the
nomad tent and beauty girls like you

01:05:10.832 --> 01:05:13.465
will bring many Ertugruls into
our nomad tent.

01:05:13.565 --> 01:05:16.332
With your feminineness and beauty.

01:06:00.965 --> 01:06:02.098
Suleiman Shah.

01:06:04.665 --> 01:06:05.832
My Suleiman.

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:11.032
I need you so much.

01:06:15.665 --> 01:06:18.998
You left me alone
in this mortal world.

01:06:21.532 --> 01:06:24.498
How I will get through it all by myself?

01:06:40.632 --> 01:06:43.865
What is it that you know about
Gokche and not telling me, Eygis?

01:06:45.032 --> 01:06:46.432
Nothing, Hanim.

01:06:48.332 --> 01:06:50.332
This winter will be hard, Eygis.

01:06:53.422 --> 01:06:55.022
You are all alone.

01:06:57.288 --> 01:07:01.888
If you want to keep working with
Artuk Bey in peace,

01:07:03.022 --> 01:07:04.088
do not lie me.

01:07:07.788 --> 01:07:10.122
What is it that you know about
Gokche and not telling me?

01:07:11.855 --> 01:07:15.022
Tell me! Who does Gokche yearn for?

01:07:17.355 --> 01:07:18.355
Ertugrul.

01:08:06.922 --> 01:08:07.955
Stop working, Halime.

01:08:09.922 --> 01:08:12.855
You are pregnant.
At least have mercy on your baby.

01:08:15.688 --> 01:08:18.188
The baby is a keepsake
from Ertugrul Bey.

01:08:20.422 --> 01:08:21.755
Pull yourself together.

01:08:24.222 --> 01:08:28.322
I need to do something.
I will not stop until Ertugrul comes back.

01:08:28.622 --> 01:08:30.055
Or I will lose my mind, Selcan.

01:08:31.988 --> 01:08:33.055
Let me go and do my bit.

01:09:52.155 --> 01:09:58.322
Welcome to the humble adobe of Geyikli
of the Bayir Bucak Turkmens.

01:10:46.888 --> 01:10:48.855
The security of our nomad tent is the
most important thing, brother.

01:10:52.755 --> 01:10:54.022
We cannot bring them
into the nomad tent.

01:10:55.055 --> 01:10:56.288
We will pay the ultimate price.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.855
The responsibility of making decisions
was conferred to you

01:11:00.955 --> 01:11:01.955
at the headquarters.

01:11:03.222 --> 01:11:05.655
I will respect
whatever decision you make.

01:11:06.822 --> 01:11:10.388
However, executing them
would be a very harsh decision.

01:11:12.822 --> 01:11:16.055
I say let's banish them.

01:11:20.822 --> 01:11:22.188
What about Ertugrul's Alps?

01:11:25.888 --> 01:11:28.088
I see that they disrespect you.

01:11:30.622 --> 01:11:33.888
However, they're our own flesh
and blood.

01:11:36.088 --> 01:11:39.022
Moreover, Mother Hayme
loves them, too.

01:11:44.155 --> 01:11:48.022
So, until this matter is resolved,
banish them, as well.

01:11:49.255 --> 01:11:51.655
They objected the decision
of the head of Alps, brother.

01:11:51.755 --> 01:11:52.955
They rebelled against us.

01:11:55.422 --> 01:11:56.822
What are they still talking about?

01:11:58.388 --> 01:12:03.622
Gundogdu Bey does not let Abdurrahman
and Hamza to be executed.

01:12:04.288 --> 01:12:07.955
Who is Tugtekin? Do we not have
our own headquarters?

01:12:08.355 --> 01:12:09.688
Do we not have
Hayme Ana to govern us?

01:12:10.222 --> 01:12:11.888
Tugtekin is the head of the Alps.

01:12:13.088 --> 01:12:15.888
His decision cannot be questioned
even at the headquarters.

01:12:16.988 --> 01:12:21.688
We aren't here to look around, but
to fight under the orders of our Beys.

01:12:22.055 --> 01:12:27.422
-We fought and we won.
-We won, but we were betrayed.

01:12:27.688 --> 01:12:30.822
We had many martyrs.
We humiliated Tugtekin.

01:12:31.688 --> 01:12:33.022
Gundogdu Bey
has his work cut out for him.

01:12:37.922 --> 01:12:38.922
They are coming.

01:12:43.155 --> 01:12:44.155
Bey?

01:12:45.955 --> 01:12:47.288
Have you decided?

01:12:56.855 --> 01:12:58.422
Abdurrahman and Hamza

01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:04.955
will not be executed.

01:13:10.955 --> 01:13:12.022
However

01:13:17.355 --> 01:13:18.688
they will not be released, either.

01:13:25.322 --> 01:13:26.688
Both will be banished.

01:13:33.722 --> 01:13:34.922
How is that possible, Bey?

01:13:42.022 --> 01:13:45.055
Dogan? Turgut?

01:13:47.822 --> 01:13:50.188
You two will be banished with them, too.

01:13:59.188 --> 01:14:00.188
What are you saying, Bey?

01:14:03.122 --> 01:14:07.388
You will not come back to into nomad
tent until the war and winter is over.

01:14:14.422 --> 01:14:16.888
You will take care of
Abdurrahman and Hamza.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.355
This is what's been decided.

01:14:45.888 --> 01:14:48.122
Since we infamized Tugtekin,

01:14:49.688 --> 01:14:52.888
we are the troublesome
Alps of Ertugrul in his mind's eyes.

01:15:37.255 --> 01:15:39.422
Damn it!

01:15:41.255 --> 01:15:42.955
Noyan's will be furious.

01:15:43.822 --> 01:15:46.622
Ertugrul escaped and to make matters
worse, the ambush failed.

01:16:05.922 --> 01:16:07.022
What should we do?

01:16:10.088 --> 01:16:12.422
If they make Bortlu talk, Kocabash's
identity will be compromised.

01:16:12.688 --> 01:16:13.688
This is worse.

01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:24.888
So do we need to rescue him?

01:16:42.922 --> 01:16:45.855
Or Kocabash must find a way
to kill Bortlu.

01:16:47.855 --> 01:16:49.055
He must kill him.

01:16:55.722 --> 01:16:56.722
Eventually

01:16:58.855 --> 01:17:03.722
Noyan will make them pay
for their inaptitude.

01:17:55.351 --> 01:17:56.684
Do not worry about me, father.

01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:02.223
Do not worry about us, Master Demir.

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:06.390
You are my only sons alive.

01:18:06.490 --> 01:18:09.490
Take care of each other, for God's sake.

01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:11.856
If something bad happens to you...

01:18:15.123 --> 01:18:16.956
Go ahead, go now!

01:18:25.123 --> 01:18:27.456
Ertugrul Bey would never act
so tactless, Gundogdu Bey.

01:18:34.323 --> 01:18:35.456
Give me your blessings.

01:18:39.956 --> 01:18:41.890
There is no blessing
left for us to give you.

01:18:46.556 --> 01:18:49.323
Tugtekin, as for you...

01:18:52.923 --> 01:18:54.923
You are nothing, let alone being
the head of Alps...

01:18:57.923 --> 01:18:58.990
Shame on you all!

01:19:30.056 --> 01:19:32.556
It hurts me, as well, Wild Demir.

01:19:33.256 --> 01:19:35.090
However, there was no other way.

01:19:37.823 --> 01:19:40.856
I need to make Bortlu talk in any case.

01:19:41.423 --> 01:19:43.556
After breaking everyone's heart

01:19:44.556 --> 01:19:48.590
can finding out the truth
bring peace on us, Gundogdu Bey?

01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:10.423
You've saved our nomad tent from
a big trouble, Bey.

01:20:12.056 --> 01:20:13.156
You are right, Kocabash.

01:20:15.556 --> 01:20:17.390
That is the only way to teach them.

01:20:44.856 --> 01:20:48.523
Not to worry.
I will find a way to rescue you.

01:20:51.823 --> 01:20:53.156
Do not say a word.

01:20:55.223 --> 01:20:56.923
Otherwise they will skin us both alive.

01:21:17.016 --> 01:21:18.016
Halime.

01:21:39.083 --> 01:21:40.150
Halime.

01:21:47.116 --> 01:21:48.450
That is love.

01:21:50.516 --> 01:21:55.216
Is love not, God killing you inside,

01:21:56.350 --> 01:22:00.250
then rescuing you from within?

01:22:07.650 --> 01:22:08.650
Halime.

01:22:16.416 --> 01:22:17.416
Halime.

01:22:58.611 --> 01:23:00.478
Fetch some water!

01:23:10.050 --> 01:23:12.583
-What happened?
-We need to take her to the tent.

01:23:17.946 --> 01:23:18.946
Mother!

01:23:23.012 --> 01:23:24.846
-Halime.
-What happened?

01:23:42.346 --> 01:23:45.979
Eygis told me that she was bleeding.
Now she is fine.

01:23:46.412 --> 01:23:48.679
However, I am worried about the baby.

01:23:51.579 --> 01:23:53.479
The poor girl couldn't stand the pain.

01:23:54.979 --> 01:23:57.312
She needs to rest now, Hayme Hatun.

01:23:57.646 --> 01:24:00.846
Otherwise Ertugrul's child
may not survive.

01:24:12.412 --> 01:24:13.412
My daughter.

01:24:15.612 --> 01:24:17.946
How I can live without him, Mother?

01:24:25.412 --> 01:24:26.612
What about your baby?

01:24:30.612 --> 01:24:32.379
If you were to die,
how can the baby live?

01:24:38.546 --> 01:24:40.712
Isn't it time to stop torturing yourself?

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:45.479
You must live for your baby.

01:25:36.979 --> 01:25:39.512
You are awake, Bey.

01:25:47.346 --> 01:25:48.412
You know me.

01:25:49.312 --> 01:25:53.746
Tangut and his bandits resounded
the forest with your name.

01:25:57.012 --> 01:25:59.412
-Who are you?
-They call me Geyikli.

01:26:00.412 --> 01:26:02.779
I've been living in this forest
since I was born.

01:26:06.279 --> 01:26:07.279
Thank you.

01:26:09.579 --> 01:26:15.512
Get up and eat some, so that you can
go after infidel Moguls in the morning.

01:26:15.946 --> 01:26:18.779
You will recover soon. Come on, lad.

01:26:29.446 --> 01:26:32.646
You shall eat it all up.
It was not easy making this.

01:26:33.712 --> 01:26:36.879
If you eat all of it,
I will give you red meat and kumiss.

01:26:37.046 --> 01:26:39.012
Fresh kumiss; without alcohol.

01:26:45.379 --> 01:26:46.846
What does Noyan want from you?

01:26:48.946 --> 01:26:52.912
I know why he came here from Tabriz.
He came here for you.

01:26:54.546 --> 01:27:00.012
If he caught, but hasn't killed you,
it means he wants something from you.

01:27:07.446 --> 01:27:08.479
You know a lot.

01:27:10.512 --> 01:27:14.246
When one lives with bears, birds,

01:27:14.346 --> 01:27:17.446
wolves and insect,

01:27:17.546 --> 01:27:20.912
his ears and eyes sharpens.

01:27:28.246 --> 01:27:30.512
It is obvious that you haven't given
Noyan what he wanted.

01:27:35.812 --> 01:27:38.979
What did he want from you?
To become his follower?

01:27:46.812 --> 01:27:47.812
Yes.

01:27:49.479 --> 01:27:52.346
You need to be careful
in every step you take, Bey.

01:27:54.812 --> 01:27:59.512
Because from now Noyan poses
a threat to everyone you love.

01:28:12.712 --> 01:28:15.012
You are a fortunate one, dear to God.

01:28:48.012 --> 01:28:49.546
We caught that human
piece of garbage called Bortlu.

01:28:49.979 --> 01:28:53.612
And we killed a lot of Moguls.
Then what happened? Nothing.

01:28:54.712 --> 01:28:57.579
That is a victory or a fiasco?

01:28:58.479 --> 01:29:01.646
They are going to say they won victory
by killing a couple of infidels.

01:29:03.312 --> 01:29:06.346
Then they will kill the Alps of the
Kayi tribe without even blinking an eye.

01:29:08.312 --> 01:29:10.546
I don't think the Kayi tribe will ever
recover from this, brother.

01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:12.346
That's how I feel.

01:29:13.612 --> 01:29:16.246
Brother? You don't know what
you're saying.

01:29:17.812 --> 01:29:20.279
I know what I am saying, brothers.

01:29:20.379 --> 01:29:23.346
Suleiman Shah died.
Ertugrul Bey, as well.

01:29:25.512 --> 01:29:27.846
From now on, the Kayi tribe
will be vanished.

01:29:29.946 --> 01:29:32.612
You are angry and you do not know
what are you saying, Hamza.

01:29:33.612 --> 01:29:37.579
I know what I am saying.
Do you not realize, brothers?

01:29:38.946 --> 01:29:41.946
Gundogdu Bey will be occupied with
finding a way to go after his uncle

01:29:42.046 --> 01:29:44.979
and his uncle's son  to bring peace
to his tribe.

01:29:46.612 --> 01:29:47.812
You know the rest.

01:29:50.946 --> 01:29:54.512
Crusaders from the
and the Mongols from the east.

01:29:56.279 --> 01:29:58.012
There is nowhere left for us
to take shelter.

01:29:58.912 --> 01:30:01.812
Ertugrul Bey used to say that
we need to fight to the death.

01:30:03.346 --> 01:30:04.346
That's what we must do.

01:30:08.279 --> 01:30:09.579
From now on,

01:30:10.879 --> 01:30:12.346
we should be ashamed of being alive

01:30:12.445 --> 01:30:14.012
for each day that
passes away without combat.

01:30:16.945 --> 01:30:20.646
I neither want to go back to my
nomad tent nor to keep living like this.

01:30:24.479 --> 01:30:26.046
They took our beloved ones from us.

01:30:26.945 --> 01:30:28.679
From now on,

01:30:29.579 --> 01:30:33.746
we have no other options, but to fight
to death against these infidels.

01:30:35.812 --> 01:30:38.912
We are not banished,
until the winter is over.

01:30:42.379 --> 01:30:45.746
We are banished to fight until we die.

01:30:47.512 --> 01:30:48.579
Everyone should know this.

01:30:51.712 --> 01:30:55.312
May God grant us with long lives

01:30:55.946 --> 01:30:58.612
so that we can kill them all.

01:30:59.379 --> 01:31:03.512
Turgut Alp is right. We shall not live
without combating.

01:31:22.479 --> 01:31:23.979
How could you do this?

01:31:27.946 --> 01:31:29.546
How could you do this?

01:31:30.612 --> 01:31:33.712
They've paid for their betrayal,
Mother Hayme. It had to be done.

01:31:34.346 --> 01:31:38.746
Tugtekin, if you are this hard,
it is easier to break you.

01:31:39.846 --> 01:31:42.312
How can you banish

01:31:42.712 --> 01:31:46.279
Ertugrul's Alps just
because they infamized you?

01:31:47.412 --> 01:31:49.846
Is that so easy to waste my gallant
boys?

01:31:52.946 --> 01:31:57.279
They've given our enemies hell
for years.

01:31:59.312 --> 01:32:01.046
How could you forget that?

01:32:06.879 --> 01:32:07.879
Shame on you!

01:32:10.912 --> 01:32:11.912
Shame on you!

01:32:13.612 --> 01:32:14.612
Shame on you!

01:32:23.246 --> 01:32:24.246
Shame on you!

01:32:28.646 --> 01:32:29.779
You did what was necessary.

01:32:32.879 --> 01:32:33.946
I will talk to Hayme.

01:32:35.612 --> 01:32:39.546
After all, she lost her son and her
nomad tent was destroyed.

01:32:39.646 --> 01:32:40.646
She is in pain.

01:32:47.746 --> 01:32:50.612
You captured one of the best
commanders of Noyan.

01:32:52.279 --> 01:32:56.646
You walked all over them.
I am proud of you, my gallant boys.

01:32:59.379 --> 01:33:04.646
If Ertugrul and Suleiman Shah were alive

01:33:05.779 --> 01:33:07.679
they would be proud of you, as well.

01:33:10.646 --> 01:33:11.979
And that is what matters.

01:33:26.846 --> 01:33:29.312
-Welcome, Bey.
-Thank you, Hatun.

01:33:30.046 --> 01:33:31.379
You came back with victory.

01:33:34.746 --> 01:33:38.879
However, you wasted your Alps
with your own hands, they say.

01:33:41.279 --> 01:33:44.279
Hatun, it is good now that the two
nomad tents have become one.

01:33:45.912 --> 01:33:49.446
We've trusted each other.
We supported each other.

01:33:49.946 --> 01:33:51.812
And we won with God's will.

01:33:52.012 --> 01:33:54.612
There must be a price for this, right?

01:33:56.012 --> 01:33:58.779
And the first ones to pay the price
are your brother's Alps.

01:34:00.679 --> 01:34:01.979
Do you know why?

01:34:04.946 --> 01:34:07.646
Gundogdu, the ambitions which captured
us once

01:34:07.746 --> 01:34:09.812
has captured this nomad tent
as well.

01:34:10.512 --> 01:34:15.279
Be careful. It will not end
as well as we thought it would.

01:34:15.512 --> 01:34:19.412
I wonder what the prices
we shall pay after Ertugrul's Alps.

01:34:19.879 --> 01:34:21.479
My mother is waiting for me.

01:34:38.512 --> 01:34:39.512
God.

01:34:41.546 --> 01:34:43.779
You brought him back to me
safe and sound.

01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:47.312
Thank you a thousand times.

01:34:48.479 --> 01:34:50.312
Show him the right way.

01:35:06.012 --> 01:35:10.412
Tugtekin Bey, you promised me
to avenge the bloodshed.

01:35:10.546 --> 01:35:14.012
-That is true, I did.
-I've heard that you kept your word.

01:35:15.379 --> 01:35:17.246
May you be happy in two worlds.

01:35:17.812 --> 01:35:19.446
When the time comes,

01:35:19.879 --> 01:35:22.746
I will plant Noyan's head
right in the middle of this nomad tent.

01:35:23.912 --> 01:35:25.279
I will do it for you, Gokche Hatun.

01:35:43.379 --> 01:35:44.846
I will make Bortlu talk, Mother.

01:35:45.512 --> 01:35:47.679
Even If I would lose my human feelings
I will make him talk.

01:35:48.046 --> 01:35:50.812
I will find out whether Abdurrahman
and Hamza are guilty or not.

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:53.812
I told my brother.

01:35:54.479 --> 01:35:58.512
It will not be easy for the two nomad
groups to live together in winter.

01:35:59.479 --> 01:36:00.746
But that is the right thing to do,
mother.

01:36:00.946 --> 01:36:02.812
But what about the price, you will pay?

01:36:03.479 --> 01:36:06.479
We cannot let anyone waste our Alps
easily, Gundogdu.

01:36:07.531 --> 01:36:11.798
I do not know whether Abdurrahman and
Hamza are guilty or not, Mother.

01:36:13.631 --> 01:36:17.898
However, if I dug my heels in, they would
execute Hamza and Abdurrahman.

01:36:17.998 --> 01:36:19.898
They are both keepsakes of our father.
Executed I say!

01:36:22.298 --> 01:36:25.231
What should I have done?
Should I revolt against Tugtekin?

01:36:25.998 --> 01:36:29.231
It means that we would set off again
to find a place for the winter.

01:36:32.764 --> 01:36:35.564
I decided to banish them
before anyone got hurt.

01:36:37.498 --> 01:36:42.498
Do not forget this, mother. At any rate,
Tugtekin and his Alps risk their lives

01:36:42.598 --> 01:36:43.764
for my brother Ertugrul.

01:36:45.064 --> 01:36:49.731
We almost died, because
our Alps were misinformed.

01:36:53.131 --> 01:36:56.064
We, two nomad tents share our destiny.

01:36:57.864 --> 01:37:00.698
I'm not under my brother's command.

01:37:00.798 --> 01:37:03.698
And you are not to take orders
from Tugtekin. Realize that.

01:37:03.931 --> 01:37:07.298
I know that, Mother.
I do not take orders from anyone.

01:37:07.931 --> 01:37:12.131
You should know that from now on,
I will do whatever I think is best.

01:37:13.964 --> 01:37:15.064
I will take my leave.

01:37:36.631 --> 01:37:39.064
Go and eat your meals.
I will keep watch.

01:37:55.164 --> 01:37:57.131
Not to worry. I am here to rescue you.

01:37:57.998 --> 01:37:59.198
How can you do this?

01:37:59.731 --> 01:38:01.798
They should believe that
you escaped on your own.

01:38:02.631 --> 01:38:04.864
Otherwise they will find out that
someone has sent Noyan a message.

01:38:05.764 --> 01:38:08.631
Do not worry, Kocabash. Hurry up.

01:38:09.664 --> 01:38:12.198
Save me from Gundogdu
and Tugtekin's tortures.

01:38:15.498 --> 01:38:16.898
Not to worry.

01:38:25.831 --> 01:38:27.998
Escape from under
the tent when you get a chance.

01:38:28.631 --> 01:38:30.298
The back of this tent
is arranged for you to flee.

01:38:37.531 --> 01:38:39.831
-Be careful.
-Do not worry.

01:38:49.831 --> 01:38:51.764
Tugtekin Bey wanted to me to watch him.

01:38:52.598 --> 01:38:54.598
Leave, Kocabash.

01:38:57.764 --> 01:38:58.764
Do not torture this man.

01:39:00.731 --> 01:39:02.231
If you punish him,
you cannot make him talk.

01:39:44.731 --> 01:39:47.198
I am going to beat you so bad that...

01:39:50.798 --> 01:39:53.664
...you will pray to God to stop breathing.

01:40:34.748 --> 01:40:37.315
We all knew this is going to be rough.

01:40:39.148 --> 01:40:40.548
It has been only two days.

01:40:43.248 --> 01:40:46.181
Small things pile up like water drops

01:40:46.848 --> 01:40:48.315
and it will be a flood

01:40:50.115 --> 01:40:54.515
that all of us will drown in that flood.

01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:56.581
You speak the truth, Mother Hayme.

01:40:57.681 --> 01:41:01.348
Before the flood, we must find a way.

01:41:04.681 --> 01:41:06.415
Water washes away but
land stands, Mother Hayme.

01:41:09.648 --> 01:41:10.848
And we, parasites

01:41:13.348 --> 01:41:17.181
do not understand it, Aytolun Hanim.
You will find a way for sure.

01:41:17.581 --> 01:41:18.715
Selcan, my daughter.

01:41:24.281 --> 01:41:28.581
Before winter comes,
we must go and sell our goods.

01:41:29.881 --> 01:41:32.315
We have limited time but also
a lot of work to do.

01:41:34.515 --> 01:41:37.448
From now on, Selcan will work
under your command, Aytolun.

01:41:39.415 --> 01:41:44.148
I talked to women who put down their tool,
they will start tomorrow.

01:41:53.915 --> 01:41:55.648
You made a right decision, Mother Hayme.

01:41:58.848 --> 01:42:00.781
Kayi woman is proud, Aytolun.

01:42:02.215 --> 01:42:04.915
They do best of their work but

01:42:07.348 --> 01:42:09.148
know that if you humiliate them

01:42:10.215 --> 01:42:12.515
you will do all the work on your own.

01:42:17.148 --> 01:42:20.181
My brother's wife death worried all of us.

01:42:21.815 --> 01:42:23.648
Because we loved her.

01:42:24.881 --> 01:42:26.581
But you kept my brother alive.

01:42:27.448 --> 01:42:30.881
You eased two sons' pains
who were killed by Mongols.

01:42:32.248 --> 01:42:33.514
You are a skillful woman.

01:42:34.648 --> 01:42:36.815
If you want us to be one and united

01:42:38.148 --> 01:42:39.748
there will be a lot on your
shoulders, Aytolun.

01:43:11.515 --> 01:43:12.648
Where is Sadettin Kobek?

01:43:13.581 --> 01:43:14.748
I have been waiting him for days.

01:43:15.415 --> 01:43:16.615
He sent his greetings.

01:43:17.581 --> 01:43:21.548
Aleaddin Keykubat gave him a new mission.
So, he could not come.

01:43:25.915 --> 01:43:27.581
So, he could not come.

01:43:29.215 --> 01:43:30.648
He is ready to do everything.

01:43:32.248 --> 01:43:33.881
He wants to be new ruler of Anatolia.

01:43:44.381 --> 01:43:45.581
Look at me, Karabek.

01:43:46.615 --> 01:43:48.615
I will give you one last mission.

01:43:54.681 --> 01:43:56.515
Tell Sadettin Kobek

01:43:57.415 --> 01:44:00.581
he would never promise coming
but not to do that next time.

01:44:01.881 --> 01:44:04.215
Or I will make this lands his grave.

01:44:32.281 --> 01:44:34.848
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:44:44.548 --> 01:44:45.681
-Innkeeper.
-Yes, Bey.

01:44:47.315 --> 01:44:48.748
-Do you have lamb?
-I do, Bey.

01:44:49.281 --> 01:44:51.615
Bring each of us a lamb than.

01:44:52.481 --> 01:44:53.481
Yes, Bey.

01:44:53.648 --> 01:44:56.548
-Give Beys pilaf and ayran, it is on me.
-Yes, Bey.

01:44:59.181 --> 01:45:00.181
Thank you.

01:45:00.748 --> 01:45:04.448
But know that we, Alps, do not take gifts.

01:45:06.181 --> 01:45:07.215
Are you Alp?

01:45:08.881 --> 01:45:10.148
Who are you?

01:45:11.181 --> 01:45:12.281
I am a merchant.

01:45:12.515 --> 01:45:14.648
I bring goods from China
and India to Anatolia.

01:45:15.181 --> 01:45:17.415
What do you do?
-We are...

01:45:19.615 --> 01:45:21.115
...Kayi nomad tent's Alps.

01:45:24.348 --> 01:45:25.581
Suleyman Shah's nomad tent.

01:45:26.715 --> 01:45:28.148
How do you know our Bey?

01:45:29.848 --> 01:45:31.415
I knew your Bey closely.

01:45:33.115 --> 01:45:36.815
Then, come and sit with us,
share our food.

01:46:36.181 --> 01:46:39.115
You are in safe hands, brave man.
May find peace.

01:46:48.348 --> 01:46:51.315
-I must go.
-Stop, brave man, you must rest.

01:46:51.848 --> 01:46:52.848
Where?

01:46:54.181 --> 01:46:58.148
Lots of heroes like you were here, Bey.

01:46:58.914 --> 01:47:00.848
Lots of brave men were shaped here.

01:47:01.715 --> 01:47:02.781
Be patient.

01:47:03.815 --> 01:47:08.515
If you are out of this hell,
all world shall scare of you.

01:47:12.281 --> 01:47:13.681
I am out of that hell, Geyikli.

01:47:17.648 --> 01:47:18.681
What if my mother...

01:47:20.515 --> 01:47:21.581
...my brother...

01:47:23.381 --> 01:47:24.448
...my lover...

01:47:25.781 --> 01:47:26.881
...my nomad group...

01:47:28.515 --> 01:47:30.615
...my Alps ould not get out of that hell?

01:47:33.348 --> 01:47:34.715
What could I do then, Geyikli?

01:47:36.481 --> 01:47:41.115
Pull yourself together, gain strength,
do not make haste.

01:47:44.148 --> 01:47:45.681
Look how miserable we are, Geyikli.

01:47:50.148 --> 01:47:52.615
We pay for our mercy in our motherland

01:47:53.415 --> 01:47:54.681
and jackals attack us.

01:48:00.548 --> 01:48:01.648
I swear...

01:48:03.748 --> 01:48:05.915
...that my sword will be covered
with their blood...

01:48:07.515 --> 01:48:10.215
...I will not let those tyrants
in these lands!

01:48:16.415 --> 01:48:19.515
This my story, brave Alps of Kayi.

01:48:22.381 --> 01:48:23.548
Why are you here, then?

01:48:25.415 --> 01:48:29.381
We left our nomad tent

01:48:30.615 --> 01:48:32.148
after we lost Ertugrul Bey.

01:48:33.715 --> 01:48:36.381
So, you are alone like me.

01:48:39.515 --> 01:48:40.548
Alright.

01:48:43.881 --> 01:48:46.115
So, I have an offer.

01:48:47.181 --> 01:48:48.215
Offer?

01:48:48.581 --> 01:48:50.248
I travel and trade goods.

01:48:50.915 --> 01:48:53.215
I struggle with bandits and tyrants.

01:48:55.115 --> 01:48:57.815
Mongols routed the lands I travel.

01:48:58.648 --> 01:49:00.515
The long and the short of it

01:49:01.348 --> 01:49:06.115
I need brave and honest fellows
who will protect my goods.

01:49:09.415 --> 01:49:11.648
-You want us as your men.
-No.

01:49:13.481 --> 01:49:14.781
I want you to be my partner.

01:49:15.848 --> 01:49:18.881
My goods lessen in every attack
and I lose some of them.

01:49:20.115 --> 01:49:25.315
But you would be with me, I travel
without losing any of them.

01:49:26.715 --> 01:49:28.815
So, my profit increases.

01:49:29.581 --> 01:49:33.615
I share my goods with you
instead of losing them to bandits.

01:49:34.815 --> 01:49:37.115
What do you think?
-Look.

01:49:39.381 --> 01:49:43.715
We draw our arms to fall a martyr.

01:49:46.148 --> 01:49:50.881
We do not draw swords and
give our lives for lucre.

01:49:53.848 --> 01:49:58.648
We are also attacked by infidels,
you could fight to them.

01:49:59.648 --> 01:50:01.115
And I give you some profit.

01:50:03.315 --> 01:50:07.815
You will win in both worlds.

01:50:12.315 --> 01:50:13.515
You do not understand us.

01:50:14.681 --> 01:50:16.148
Do not waste your breath.

01:50:17.881 --> 01:50:19.815
If we fight for lucre

01:50:20.815 --> 01:50:24.248
our arms would be useless,
our courage breaks.

01:50:25.381 --> 01:50:27.715
We are friends and let us
keep it that way.

01:50:36.615 --> 01:50:37.681
The decision is yours.

01:50:40.215 --> 01:50:41.248
The offer is mine.

01:50:45.848 --> 01:50:46.848
Do not worry.

01:51:04.448 --> 01:51:05.515
I am waiting for my father.

01:51:06.248 --> 01:51:07.648
He said he would be here soon.

01:51:15.281 --> 01:51:16.448
Your father is sad.

01:51:21.115 --> 01:51:22.181
Mother Hayme...

01:51:23.381 --> 01:51:28.781
...she is a good woman but she is
as stubborn as his late father.

01:51:32.348 --> 01:51:35.115
If you want to command
two nomad tents Alps

01:51:36.115 --> 01:51:38.648
and show that you are a great warrior

01:51:40.148 --> 01:51:42.281
you must get along well with her.

01:51:44.915 --> 01:51:46.315
And there is Gokce.

01:51:47.215 --> 01:51:50.215
If you want to take that girl
to your bed sooner or later

01:51:51.215 --> 01:51:54.415
you will ask for her permission first.

01:51:56.181 --> 01:51:57.881
I will do my best for Gokce

01:51:58.915 --> 01:52:02.515
but other matter is more complicated.

01:52:05.748 --> 01:52:08.415
-What shall I do?
-You need to talk to her.

01:52:12.481 --> 01:52:16.515
You are a young man who uses his tongue
as good as his sword.

01:52:17.415 --> 01:52:18.881
She has just lost her son.

01:52:19.848 --> 01:52:24.581
She would see Ertugrul in you
and lower her colors.

01:52:25.648 --> 01:52:27.281
I think you must handle it quickly.

01:52:40.515 --> 01:52:43.681
We are solving our problems
one by one with Tugtekin, Bey.

01:52:46.115 --> 01:52:47.215
Right, Tugtekin?

01:52:51.381 --> 01:52:53.248
You speak the truth, mother.

01:53:24.715 --> 01:53:25.715
If you excuse me, mother.

01:53:39.548 --> 01:53:40.548
Mother.

01:53:45.415 --> 01:53:49.515
He could be right but he does
not object exiling Alps

01:53:50.381 --> 01:53:51.681
and it sticks in my throat!

01:53:55.115 --> 01:53:56.181
Mother!

01:53:59.148 --> 01:54:02.315
We shall not forget who we are
and where we came from.

01:54:04.848 --> 01:54:06.881
Kayis are not glorious as they used to be.

01:54:09.448 --> 01:54:10.581
We suffered a lot.

01:54:13.148 --> 01:54:14.681
Gundogdu brother did what is right.

01:54:17.381 --> 01:54:20.515
Ertugrul's Alps will come back
when winter is over.

01:54:21.481 --> 01:54:23.215
Abdurrahman and Hamza...

01:54:24.215 --> 01:54:26.148
...truth will be revealed sooner or later.

01:54:32.115 --> 01:54:38.415
Moreover, you and Gundogdu decided to give
commandership of Alps to Tugtekin.

01:54:42.181 --> 01:54:44.915
Whatever, I am in over my head.

01:54:53.481 --> 01:54:54.481
Gokce.

01:54:58.315 --> 01:55:01.481
Bring food to Halime, she should eat.

01:55:02.581 --> 01:55:03.715
Come on, my daughter.

01:55:07.448 --> 01:55:08.515
Alright, mother.

01:55:22.648 --> 01:55:25.748
Be careful about Aytolun
and Tugtekin, mother.

01:55:27.448 --> 01:55:29.148
They want to poison my Bey.

01:55:29.915 --> 01:55:32.548
As they want to poison my sister Gokce.

01:55:36.648 --> 01:55:37.648
Gokce?

01:55:51.481 --> 01:55:52.515
Tell Kobek...

01:55:53.915 --> 01:55:57.381
...to persuade Sultan Aleaddin
to give tribute to Ogeday.

01:56:02.215 --> 01:56:04.581
Or I will level these lands
with the ground.

01:56:06.481 --> 01:56:08.415
Sultan would not agree that.

01:56:09.648 --> 01:56:14.281
If Kobek persuades Sultan,
he would be next ruler.

01:56:16.348 --> 01:56:17.348
Understood?

01:56:21.115 --> 01:56:22.148
Peace be upon you.

01:56:24.348 --> 01:56:25.381
Can I talk?

01:56:25.781 --> 01:56:27.248
Yes, Hamza. Of course.

01:56:29.348 --> 01:56:34.315
As I said, if he wants the goods,
he must pay the price.

01:56:35.481 --> 01:56:37.115
Bring my offer to him, quickly.

01:56:38.615 --> 01:56:39.881
Do not worry.

01:56:44.681 --> 01:56:45.681
Come.

01:56:55.548 --> 01:56:58.315
What is the matter, Hamza?
What makes you up late?

01:57:00.248 --> 01:57:01.615
Does your offer still stand?

01:57:04.581 --> 01:57:06.748
So, that is what makes our Alp up.

01:57:08.848 --> 01:57:09.848
Look, Hamza.

01:57:11.381 --> 01:57:14.848
I need brave men to protect
my goods and life.

01:57:16.215 --> 01:57:17.315
Is it profitable?

01:57:18.115 --> 01:57:20.548
More profitable than 10.000 sheep.

01:57:23.815 --> 01:57:24.881
Are you in?

01:59:24.248 --> 01:59:25.248
Hamza is missing.

01:59:28.815 --> 01:59:30.148
What do you mean missing?

01:59:30.415 --> 01:59:32.115
He took his arms and horse and left.

01:59:33.915 --> 01:59:36.515
He must be around, brother.
Where will he go to?

01:59:37.148 --> 01:59:40.581
I talked to innkeeper, he said Hamza left
with merchant early in the morning.

01:59:43.815 --> 01:59:44.815
Bastard.

01:59:46.381 --> 01:59:48.315
So, he decided to be servant
of that merchant.

01:59:58.381 --> 02:00:00.148
Kayis are worthless now, Bey.

02:00:02.281 --> 02:00:03.748
Ertugrul Bey was the last hope
of nomad group.

02:00:05.748 --> 02:00:07.248
After he died, it is over.

02:00:13.215 --> 02:00:14.715
They broke your heart, Hamza.

02:00:18.181 --> 02:00:20.881
I have served to my nomad group

02:00:22.515 --> 02:00:23.781
and Gundogdu Bey ever since
I could remember.

02:00:25.681 --> 02:00:27.181
I fought countless battles.

02:00:28.348 --> 02:00:30.281
I got nothing now.

02:00:32.248 --> 02:00:35.615
I could not go back to my nomad tent,
Gundogdu Bey exiled me.

02:00:37.281 --> 02:00:38.515
Even though he knows I am innocent.

02:00:39.648 --> 02:00:43.715
He wasted me to ingratiate
himself to Tugtekin.

02:00:56.448 --> 02:00:58.881
Take this lucre and
pull yourself together.

02:01:03.915 --> 02:01:05.248
I will meet a merchant.

02:01:06.448 --> 02:01:07.881
Wait for me in inn hill.

02:01:08.848 --> 02:01:09.915
I shall come with you.

02:01:10.915 --> 02:01:12.515
Merchant is coward, Hamza.

02:01:13.315 --> 02:01:17.181
If he sees you, he thinks
I would seize his goods.

02:01:19.415 --> 02:01:20.448
Alright, Bey.

02:01:27.881 --> 02:01:29.281
<i>Permission, Aunt Hayme?</i>

02:01:31.148 --> 02:01:32.515
Come. Come in, Tugtekin.

02:01:37.748 --> 02:01:38.815
Sit down, Tugtekin.

02:01:52.381 --> 02:01:53.615
I thought about what happened yesterday.

02:01:56.448 --> 02:01:58.148
I understood that I acted
impulsively, Aunt Hayme.

02:02:01.815 --> 02:02:02.915
But my anger was major.

02:02:07.381 --> 02:02:08.581
I lost too many brave men, aunt.

02:02:11.115 --> 02:02:12.181
I do not know how

02:02:13.515 --> 02:02:14.848
but I know Hamza is a traitor.

02:02:18.448 --> 02:02:19.881
If there were not Gundogdu brother...

02:02:22.415 --> 02:02:25.781
So, what about Ertugrul's Alps?

02:02:28.248 --> 02:02:30.515
They became rascals wondering
on mountains, aunt.

02:02:32.848 --> 02:02:34.915
They are rascals after Ertugrul's death.

02:02:36.381 --> 02:02:37.648
They disobey orders.

02:02:43.615 --> 02:02:44.915
If I forgive them

02:02:46.548 --> 02:02:47.881
I could not influence my Alps.

02:02:53.915 --> 02:02:57.115
Whatever, we will talk
when winter is over.

02:03:00.781 --> 02:03:02.148
When I look at you...

02:03:05.415 --> 02:03:06.481
...I see...

02:03:08.281 --> 02:03:09.481
...Ertugrul...

02:03:11.815 --> 02:03:14.348
...in your eyes and your chin.

02:03:18.481 --> 02:03:19.581
<i>Permission, Mother Hayme?</i>

02:03:21.315 --> 02:03:22.315
Come in, daughter.

02:03:27.181 --> 02:03:31.115
You asked for Gokce but she went
to Keltepe to pick up grass.

02:03:31.881 --> 02:03:33.881
All right, daughter. Tell her
to see me when she comes.

02:03:49.348 --> 02:03:50.581
Look, what happened to us.

02:03:51.581 --> 02:03:53.148
First, our Bey fall a martyr.

02:03:54.181 --> 02:03:58.548
Then our nomad tent was routed,
now our brothers are traitors.

02:04:01.615 --> 02:04:04.881
Talk Abdurrahman brother, what happened?

02:04:06.648 --> 02:04:07.815
I do not know, Turgut.

02:04:08.681 --> 02:04:11.348
We captured a Mongol and made him talk.

02:04:12.181 --> 02:04:13.481
We reported to our Bey.

02:04:15.548 --> 02:04:16.681
You know what happened after.

02:04:22.215 --> 02:04:23.381
Noyan baited us.

02:04:26.548 --> 02:04:27.581
He set a trap.

02:04:29.115 --> 02:04:30.181
That is what happened.

02:04:33.248 --> 02:04:34.448
Mongols are treacherous!

02:04:36.181 --> 02:04:39.415
If Ertugrul Bey was here,
he would find a way.

02:04:41.215 --> 02:04:42.415
We must alert the nomad group.

02:04:53.248 --> 02:04:54.248
Peace be upon you.

02:04:56.681 --> 02:04:58.681
-And peace be upon you.
-Another country heard from.

02:05:00.881 --> 02:05:02.115
Do you know him?

02:05:03.148 --> 02:05:04.215
I wish I had not.

02:05:09.215 --> 02:05:11.148
Who are you? What do you do?

02:05:14.548 --> 02:05:16.415
It is obvious that you had a trouble.

02:05:17.881 --> 02:05:19.448
Come and let me serve you food.

02:05:19.881 --> 02:05:21.848
Thank you, Geyikli. We are fine.

02:05:24.181 --> 02:05:25.281
Go to your way.

02:05:26.448 --> 02:05:28.881
Come, come. I have a gift for you.

02:05:40.148 --> 02:05:42.415
-Where is Gokce Hatun?
-She went that way, Bey.

02:06:52.848 --> 02:06:53.881
How are you Gokce?

02:07:08.648 --> 02:07:09.781
I was passing by and saw you.

02:07:10.815 --> 02:07:12.181
I wanted to ask how you are doing.

02:07:13.881 --> 02:07:14.881
I am fine.

02:07:26.281 --> 02:07:27.415
You should always smile like this.

02:07:30.748 --> 02:07:34.115
When you are sad, I mumble.

02:07:37.915 --> 02:07:39.348
I do not know what to talk to you.

02:07:41.648 --> 02:07:42.815
That bad?

02:07:47.315 --> 02:07:48.415
You could not imagine.

02:08:02.148 --> 02:08:03.548
Noyan is coming! Noyan is coming!

02:08:05.215 --> 02:08:07.181
Gather up! Gather up!

02:08:34.215 --> 02:08:35.248
Where is Ertugrul?

02:08:38.115 --> 02:08:39.115
He escaped, sir.

02:08:42.315 --> 02:08:43.415
What do you mean escaped?

02:08:44.715 --> 02:08:46.415
What do you mean escaped?

02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:52.381
So, I would kill you first!

02:09:02.448 --> 02:09:03.548
Ertugrul will die!

02:09:04.581 --> 02:09:05.915
Ertugrul will die!

02:09:10.915 --> 02:09:14.881
He will die even if I must sacrifice
whole Mongol army!

02:09:26.415 --> 02:09:27.481
What about the Mongol trap?

02:09:30.148 --> 02:09:31.881
Trap failed.

02:09:33.648 --> 02:09:34.715
They captured Borklu.

02:09:42.881 --> 02:09:44.115
What if he talks?

02:09:45.748 --> 02:09:47.748
What if he reveals the spy in nomad group?

02:09:50.481 --> 02:09:52.215
What if they learn where we are?

02:09:53.748 --> 02:09:54.848
He will die, Noyan.

02:09:55.781 --> 02:09:57.181
Kocabash will do it.

02:09:57.848 --> 02:09:58.915
Look at me, Tankut!

02:09:59.648 --> 02:10:02.915
I gave you a mission,
you screwed up everything!

02:10:03.915 --> 02:10:07.915
If you fail me again,
I make dog food from your flesh!

02:10:35.481 --> 02:10:37.281
Has not the infidel talked yet?

02:10:37.515 --> 02:10:38.515
No, Bey.

02:10:48.481 --> 02:10:49.915
Guard, where is Borklu?

02:10:51.615 --> 02:10:54.515
Where is Borklu?
-He attacked behind and escaped, Bey.

02:12:44.281 --> 02:12:45.381
Where does this madman take us?

02:12:46.915 --> 02:12:49.181
This is not a good sign.

02:12:50.415 --> 02:12:51.715
May god help us.

02:14:07.215 --> 02:14:08.348
Gundogdu is chasing me.

02:14:09.548 --> 02:14:10.615
Finish him.

02:15:10.315 --> 02:15:11.315
Ertugrul Bey?
