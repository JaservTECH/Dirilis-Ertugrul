00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 61 will start after 13:53 min.

13:53.117 --> 13:57.869
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

14:26.712 --> 14:27.812
Mother?

14:44.079 --> 14:45.779
What have you done, son?

14:49.646 --> 14:51.646
How can you leave us?

14:53.212 --> 14:56.679
Leaving your father's marquee, his
nomad tent...

14:58.312 --> 15:00.079
How can you go?

15:02.712 --> 15:05.646
I will take the blessed road bestowed
upon the Oghuz, mother.

15:13.012 --> 15:17.212
Your father's marquee... How can it bear
this separation?

15:18.079 --> 15:20.346
You should know that I beatify my
father's soul.

15:21.779 --> 15:24.979
Neither I nor the gallants who
accompany me

15:25.079 --> 15:27.679
have any hesitations or grief.

15:29.246 --> 15:31.746
If this is what makes your heart grieve

15:32.146 --> 15:37.179
do not forget that Suleyman Shah's son
Ertugrul is on right path.

15:42.346 --> 15:44.579
When I brought Halime to
the nomad tent

15:44.979 --> 15:47.146
and I told you that I had fallen
in love with her

15:48.012 --> 15:50.179
you told me that I'd thrown the whole
marquee into fire.

15:57.179 --> 15:58.912
And then I said...

16:02.746 --> 16:04.346
..."You throw the marquee into fire.

16:06.012 --> 16:10.646
Some fire burns loaf.

16:13.079 --> 16:16.812
Some fire cooks loaf."

16:18.612 --> 16:22.112
She showed you where to jump into fire.

16:23.679 --> 16:28.579
It is neither your nor the tribe's
business to rebel on it.

16:31.079 --> 16:33.746
I said this is a trial of God.

16:34.179 --> 16:35.979
This is a trial like every love, Mother.

16:36.879 --> 16:41.846
As you say, I will either become a burnt
loaf or a well-cooked one.

16:44.612 --> 16:49.112
To be blessed by the oppressed and
continue on the right path,

16:49.212 --> 16:51.612
me and my Alps take the chance of
burning, Mother.

16:53.546 --> 16:57.046
Our wish is to cook on this right path,
if God lets me.

16:59.212 --> 17:01.012
That's why I'll set off, Mother.

17:03.912 --> 17:05.246
I'm here to ask for your blessing.

17:11.912 --> 17:15.779
How will my heart bear this?

17:20.746 --> 17:25.312
My life is yours, but how can I tell you
to go?

17:30.979 --> 17:34.912
I gave you my blessing the day
you were born.

17:36.012 --> 17:38.112
Surely it is all yours.

17:43.846 --> 17:50.779
How do I grow old in your father's
marquee, apart from you?

17:56.212 --> 18:01.179
Do not go, my son. Do not take
my heart and leave.

18:09.746 --> 18:11.246
You can come with us, Mother.

18:12.812 --> 18:16.012
That way Halime, Gunduz, and Dundar
will not be alone.

18:19.746 --> 18:23.779
How can I leave Sungur...

18:25.012 --> 18:27.646
...Gundogdu, and Sevcan alone?

18:28.846 --> 18:32.579
I could never leave your father's
marquee.

18:36.079 --> 18:39.012
I could not do this.

18:41.679 --> 18:43.212
Do not ask this of me.

18:45.712 --> 18:50.179
You should know that your heart will
always be with me, Mother.

18:52.079 --> 18:57.112
Every step I take, every war I fight,
your heart will give me strength.

19:00.646 --> 19:04.646
Whenever I am in difficulty, I will find
consolation in your heart.

19:05.912 --> 19:12.112
You should know that, my heart and my
prayers will always be with you.

19:19.046 --> 19:20.346
Give me your blessings, Mother.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.246
I give you my blessing.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.246
It is all yours, my son.

21:04.612 --> 21:05.879
Praise be, brother.

21:06.879 --> 21:07.946
Praise be.

21:09.112 --> 21:10.679
Praise be, brother.

21:13.212 --> 21:15.646
-Peace be upon you, brothers.
-And peace be upon you.

21:17.112 --> 21:19.546
We are ready to go with Ertugrul Bey,
Dogan Alp.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.179
Thank you, brothers. May God be with
us.

21:23.279 --> 21:24.579
Amen.

21:25.112 --> 21:28.646
Our wives and our sisters are biding
farewell to the women in the workshop.

21:30.079 --> 21:32.812
We will go after we get Mother Hayme's
blessings, brothers.

21:32.946 --> 21:35.046
-We will meet in front of the marquee.
-Thank you!

21:42.212 --> 21:44.312
Most of the Alps who promised to come
did not show up.

21:45.212 --> 21:48.846
What shall we do? Did we not say that
if need be we will go alone?

21:49.712 --> 21:54.346
Yes, we said that, but all of the labor
and effort, was it all in vain?

21:54.712 --> 21:57.346
No, brother, nothing is in vain.

21:57.646 --> 22:00.246
God will give the reward of our efforts.

22:00.579 --> 22:03.746
The patience is a blessing and healing.

22:04.346 --> 22:08.212
We did all we can do. Time is the time
to trust, brother.

22:13.279 --> 22:16.579
Samsa and Kaya Alp brothers came to
say goodbye to us.

22:19.912 --> 22:21.712
We did not come to say goodbye,
Bamsi Brother.

22:27.279 --> 22:29.179
We are going with you, brothers.

22:31.179 --> 22:35.179
Brothers, how can Dodurga people
come with us?

22:35.712 --> 22:38.046
What does it matter if we keep the same
path?

22:38.646 --> 22:42.012
Don't we all come from the same Oghuz
family?

22:43.546 --> 22:47.746
Our decision is final, brother. We'll go
wherever Ertugrul Bey is going.

22:49.979 --> 22:51.879
Long live brothers!

22:51.946 --> 22:55.212
Praise be, brothers. No one can stand
against us anymore.

22:55.812 --> 22:57.212
Praise be brothers.

22:58.279 --> 22:59.546
Praise be.

23:00.646 --> 23:02.746
Praise be, brothers.

23:06.812 --> 23:09.746
Are you stupid enough to be tempted by
them and perish?

23:09.846 --> 23:12.012
What good is this punishment against
the shroud?

23:13.012 --> 23:14.279
What are you saying, brother?

23:15.012 --> 23:17.846
Since Tugtekin Bey died, we have
no place in this nomad tent.

23:18.712 --> 23:20.846
Ertugrul Bey is our Bey from now on.

23:21.946 --> 23:24.179
You are talking through your hat.

23:24.312 --> 23:27.812
Many weak armies managed to defeat
larger armies in the past.

23:28.012 --> 23:31.679
All mouth and no trousers when it comes
to customs.

23:32.346 --> 23:35.879
Can anyone leaving their nomad tent be
pardoned according to our customs?

23:36.812 --> 23:39.012
-What are you saying? Know your place!
-Brother, stop!

23:39.079 --> 23:40.779
Let me, smash his face.

23:41.779 --> 23:43.912
You insist on going your way!

23:44.579 --> 23:50.179
There is no brave men would go
freely from this nomad tent.

23:51.846 --> 23:55.646
Brothers, come to your senses!

23:56.046 --> 23:58.712
What are you doing?
Do not use your weapons!

24:08.146 --> 24:10.679
Get out of here, do not cause us
any trouble.

24:11.546 --> 24:14.112
You'll soon see what trouble is.

24:35.546 --> 24:39.079
Hatuns, where are the other ladies?
Are they about to finish their tasks?

24:39.646 --> 24:42.212
That's all of us, Halime Sultan.
Most of the women gave up.

24:43.112 --> 24:47.646
Did they give up? Why have they
given up?

24:48.012 --> 24:51.979
Their husbands became rich with the
gold Gundogdu Bey gave them.

24:53.079 --> 24:55.679
Very few people are left, Halime Sultan.

25:00.846 --> 25:04.012
We'll not give up on our dreams even if
there are a thousand people or just one.

25:05.246 --> 25:09.012
You should know that those who
exchange their vows to gold

25:09.112 --> 25:11.046
will never be triumph.

25:12.879 --> 25:19.112
Now, we will walk tall from this nomad
tent and set off for our future.

25:44.079 --> 25:49.612
You will fall prey to the enemies in the
field of the heretics.

25:50.745 --> 25:56.646
I know and I see everything, but I
can't do anything.

25:58.245 --> 26:00.612
I am really upset because I'm helpless.

26:01.979 --> 26:04.146
I could not persuade Gundogdu Bey.

26:05.579 --> 26:08.679
Neither Ertugrul Bey, nor you.

26:12.646 --> 26:15.112
Don't be sad, Selcan.

26:16.346 --> 26:20.812
Our hope will manage to overcome
the heretics and any other trouble.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.879
I believe that we will succeed.

26:26.646 --> 26:29.046
What good it is to be successful?

26:29.546 --> 26:32.779
As long as we are separated from
each other's shadows

26:33.312 --> 26:35.346
what would I do with peace, Halime?

26:38.312 --> 26:40.079
Do not speak like that, Selcan.

26:40.312 --> 26:42.812
Which distance can separate us from
each other?

26:43.712 --> 26:46.946
Our paths are separated, but our hearts
will always be together.

26:55.279 --> 26:58.612
I knitted this for Gunduz.

27:00.146 --> 27:01.946
This way his feet won't be cold.

27:15.179 --> 27:16.979
God be with you, sister.

27:18.046 --> 27:20.946
My God keep you safe from any kind
of trouble.

27:31.146 --> 27:35.846
It will be good for both nomad tents when
Ertugrul leaves. Finally we'll find peace.

27:36.546 --> 27:39.579
It is true that when Ertugrul goes
we will get rid of a big trouble.

27:39.979 --> 27:41.612
The hell with him!

27:42.046 --> 27:45.346
However, I will not let any of the Alps
to go with him.

27:45.646 --> 27:49.279
It is the Kayi tribe's matter, Bey. How
are you going to get involved?

27:49.579 --> 27:51.679
Ameer Sadettin agrees with me.

27:54.346 --> 27:58.146
More importantly, the tribe who cannot
control its Alps would lose face.

27:58.579 --> 28:00.012
I will not let this happen.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.712
How will you do it, Bey?

28:10.946 --> 28:14.179
As you ordered, 10 of our Alps are ready
to go with Ertugrul Bey.

28:15.579 --> 28:17.746
Do you understand how I will
intervene now?

28:20.346 --> 28:25.746
Kaya and Samsa actually want to
join, Ertugrul Bey.

28:29.779 --> 28:32.879
They were the only ones left from
Tugtekin.

28:33.246 --> 28:34.846
We will settle their account soon
enough.

28:35.579 --> 28:37.746
Start as soon as possible.
Alps must step into action right away.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.146
Your wish is my command, Bey.

28:44.746 --> 28:47.046
We shall clip Ertugrul's wings.

29:05.346 --> 29:08.046
<i>-Permission, Bey?</i>
-Come in, Dogan Alp.

29:14.312 --> 29:15.846
The immigration community is ready.

29:16.279 --> 29:20.312
The late Tugtekin Bey's Alps Samsa
and Kaya will come with us.

29:20.946 --> 29:23.079
After that 10 Dodurga Alps will join us.

29:24.346 --> 29:28.546
But most of the Alps did not show up
to the training place

29:28.912 --> 29:31.746
because of the gold Gundogdu Bey
gave them.

29:38.279 --> 29:41.079
Then we need to be more cautious
on our way.

29:41.212 --> 29:43.746
Are you expecting trouble from
Ameer Sadettin?

29:44.612 --> 29:47.546
I'm sure he'll plan for an attack as soon
as he hears that we're on our way.

29:48.079 --> 29:49.346
You are right, Bey.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.879
We must be cautious until we get there.

29:52.112 --> 29:55.312
As we come closer to the border of
Byzantium, not only Kobek,

29:55.579 --> 29:58.879
but also our coward enemies will try
to attack us.

29:59.779 --> 30:01.979
The Crusaders, and Byzantine soldiers...

30:02.112 --> 30:07.046
Mercenaries from different tribes.
Bandits. We are weak in number.

30:07.646 --> 30:10.612
Your presence and your wisdom will give
us strength, Artuk Bey.

30:11.312 --> 30:12.746
Thank you, Bey.

30:16.812 --> 30:19.312
We cannot use the way that we used
with the Alps before.

30:21.979 --> 30:25.346
We will prefer a longer, but a safer way.

30:26.212 --> 30:28.646
We will cross the Kose Mountains
and the Tecer Mountains

30:28.846 --> 30:30.946
and then we'll cross Kizilirmak.

30:32.712 --> 30:36.212
And we will reach the border across
from Enguri.

30:39.579 --> 30:45.612
I won't be worrying about my men while
I'm fighting, thanks to you, Artuk Bey.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.246
You should know that while dealing with
these enemies

30:48.312 --> 30:54.279
I will entrust my marquee, my son
and Halime Sultan to you.

30:56.146 --> 30:58.179
I will be worthy of the task, Bey.

31:00.212 --> 31:03.746
I appointed Dogan Alp for the safety
of the power caravan.

31:04.246 --> 31:09.146
Samsa, Bamsi Alp and Kaya will be
the vanguard pacify the road.

31:09.779 --> 31:13.979
Your wish is my command, Bey.
We won't give way to the enemy.

31:14.346 --> 31:15.679
With God's help.

31:17.312 --> 31:20.946
Upon reaching our destination, we
should know how to train ourselves

31:21.046 --> 31:22.046
just like our enemies.

31:22.846 --> 31:28.012
We must establish good relations with
Muslims and non-Muslims for trade.

31:29.612 --> 31:32.912
Therefore, we should know how to keep
our doors open to those

31:33.046 --> 31:36.079
who can empower our mind with their
knowledge and our spirit with their art.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.312
We need to build a new sewing
workshop.

31:39.912 --> 31:43.612
Our seeds will not hold root if we are
short of any of these.

31:44.079 --> 31:48.046
It might break in the gentlest of winds.
Keep that in mind.

31:49.879 --> 31:54.912
When you are talking, I see
Oghuz Khan's, Bilge Khan's

31:55.612 --> 31:58.712
and even Sultan Alparslan's fire
in your eyes.

31:59.846 --> 32:02.912
May God keep you and the Kayis
become successful.

32:05.179 --> 32:06.246
Amen.

32:25.946 --> 32:30.279
Bey, I would like to come with you.

32:33.346 --> 32:36.746
I have entrusted my mother to you,
Abdurrahman.

32:37.846 --> 32:39.712
Yes, Bey, but I...

32:41.612 --> 32:43.279
Do not leave my mother alone,
Abdurrahman.

32:50.312 --> 32:55.712
I can die for, Mother Hayme if need be.
God speed.

32:58.079 --> 33:00.279
-Give me your blessings, Bey.
-I give you my blessings.

33:46.312 --> 33:48.012
<i>The time has come, Wild Demir.</i>

33:48.346 --> 33:51.146
<i>It's high time we rebel against cruelty.</i>

33:51.679 --> 33:54.079
We've came to this land with hope, Bey.

33:54.546 --> 33:57.279
We wanted to find joy and liven, but
each day we went through different hell.

33:57.846 --> 34:02.146
If I can't make them pay for what
they've done to us

34:02.579 --> 34:04.979
I can no longer live as an honorable
man.

34:05.279 --> 34:07.179
What are you thinking, Bey?

34:19.712 --> 34:23.279
I spent half my life with the Mongols
for my state.

34:26.812 --> 34:31.579
I had one consolation: To be able to
go back to our own marquee.

34:33.579 --> 34:36.046
I wanted to go back to my mother
and my brothers.

34:37.246 --> 34:41.679
I came back, but now a new kind of
separation looms our marquee.

34:43.846 --> 34:46.212
We have lived for our tribe and
our honor.

34:46.879 --> 34:50.179
We have fought, we have killed,
we have lost lives, too.

34:50.612 --> 34:53.679
The survival of our state has always
been the most important thing.

34:54.546 --> 34:59.912
But our love for our state never
disabled us.

35:02.646 --> 35:05.246
Whatever I did, I did it for the sake
of our state, Ertugrul.

35:06.312 --> 35:09.679
I did it for our tribe, not for
Ameer Sadettin.

35:10.946 --> 35:14.012
You treated me the way Yusuf's brothers
treated Yusuf, brother.

35:14.812 --> 35:19.612
You become a tool to Kobek's games.
You threw me into the well.

35:20.712 --> 35:24.012
I have no words to say.
I no longer have hope in my heart.

35:25.079 --> 35:27.046
Everyone will go their own way.

35:32.546 --> 35:34.646
If I tell you not to go

35:35.579 --> 35:39.046
I know that you will not listen to me
and go anyway.

35:40.646 --> 35:44.012
However, I cannot let you go with my
men, as the head of the Alps.

35:46.746 --> 35:49.246
Our fate together ends here, brother.

35:50.212 --> 35:53.812
Give your blessing to me and to my Alps.

35:54.879 --> 35:57.112
Do you not hear what I'm telling you,
Ertugrul?

35:57.679 --> 36:00.146
I will not let you take my Alps and leave.

36:00.212 --> 36:04.279
And I cannot let you take Dundar away
from Mother.

36:09.279 --> 36:10.946
Do not confront me!

36:41.179 --> 36:42.579
Disperse!

36:44.012 --> 36:46.046
No one will leave their tents!

36:47.179 --> 36:51.112
Akca Bey commands it. If someone
revolts, he or she will be punished.

36:56.879 --> 36:58.046
Go back to your tents!

37:04.746 --> 37:07.279
Go, go!

37:39.812 --> 37:40.946
As you have said

37:41.012 --> 37:44.112
I did not allow the community to gather
in front of marquee, Sungurtekin Bey.

37:45.046 --> 37:48.946
Ertugrul should see that he is all alone.
My Alps should not go with him, either.

37:49.846 --> 37:51.812
Not to worry, Sungurtekin Bey.

37:52.312 --> 37:54.912
No one will feel the absence of
Gundogdu Bey.

38:23.988 --> 38:26.921
-Get down from there.
-Down, get down! I said get down!

38:28.621 --> 38:30.088
What are you doing Alps?

38:30.155 --> 38:33.388
You are not permitted to leave.
Get back to your tents right now.

38:33.755 --> 38:35.121
You cannot do this.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.055
Akca Bey and Sungurtekin Bey's orders.

38:37.121 --> 38:39.088
You are forbidden to leave.

39:00.788 --> 39:03.088
Mother. Give me your blessing.

39:05.021 --> 39:06.821
My blessing is with you my son.

39:08.988 --> 39:11.088
I entrust you to each other.

39:13.621 --> 39:15.488
I would do anything for your entrustment.

39:43.055 --> 39:46.055
The ones who will go with
brother Ertugrul wish to see...

39:46.121 --> 39:48.888
...you for the last time
and get your blessings.

39:52.055 --> 39:53.388
For the last time.

39:55.888 --> 40:00.621
Seeing you
and your brother, Halime Sultan...

40:02.688 --> 40:07.521
...my Gunduz and many brave Alps,...

40:07.588 --> 40:10.155
...for the last time.

40:13.521 --> 40:15.688
How will my heart take this my son?

40:17.355 --> 40:19.755
Mother, I am begging you. Do not do this.

41:31.355 --> 41:34.088
We are not many, Bey. That scares me.

41:36.855 --> 41:39.388
Do not count the braves
on the road, Dogan.

41:40.888 --> 41:43.688
What matters is,
who we go on the road with.

41:45.888 --> 41:48.621
The essence these brave men
whom we go on the road with...

41:49.388 --> 41:53.921
...carry inside, will give us
strength, on our darkest and...

41:53.988 --> 41:57.055
...hardest day. That is what matters.

41:58.688 --> 42:02.355
Well Bey, with God's will,
we still have a long road...

42:02.855 --> 42:04.388
...until Constantinople.

42:07.755 --> 42:11.621
Artuk Bey! Artuk Bey! Artuk Bey.

42:12.955 --> 42:17.988
We were standing by just outside
the tent with the cars and...

42:18.055 --> 42:21.655
...horses, Artuk Bey.
But Dodurga Alps came...

42:21.721 --> 42:23.855
...and stopped us from doing that.

42:55.021 --> 42:57.788
Brave man, what do you
think you are doing?

43:00.088 --> 43:03.788
Do not make this harder, Artuk.
This is our Bey's order.

43:36.721 --> 43:40.355
Ertugrul Bey. This is a presumption.
Where do you...

43:40.421 --> 43:43.888
...think you are going with
my Alps, without permission?

43:45.655 --> 43:50.755
Akca Bey. You got your head Alp
with you and you speak to me...

43:50.821 --> 43:54.055
...with tongue of Kobek called Ameer.

43:54.855 --> 43:58.355
Know your place Ertugrul.
You already broke the rules...

43:58.421 --> 44:00.455
...of two nomad groups and Beys.

44:02.521 --> 44:06.588
Bey. We were Alps of Tugtekin Bey.

44:07.788 --> 44:10.688
And now our bey is Ertugrul Bey.

44:13.955 --> 44:16.488
Give us your blessings.

44:26.921 --> 44:31.388
Alps. Wait.

44:33.988 --> 44:38.521
Sungurtekin, Akca Bey.
What do you think you are doing?

44:39.888 --> 44:42.155
Do you intend to set
Alps against each other?

44:42.388 --> 44:44.921
Yes, for the sake of our
groups prestige, if necessary.

44:47.888 --> 44:51.488
Ertugrul can go wherever he wants.
I have nothing to say.

44:51.555 --> 44:55.988
However, no Alps from Kayi or
Dodurga will leave from here.

44:56.855 --> 44:58.755
That is our word.

45:00.855 --> 45:03.721
Alps are bonded with each other
by a connection stronger than...

45:03.788 --> 45:07.555
...brotherhood. However, man
who did not get his share of...

45:07.621 --> 45:11.055
...being an Alp, like you,
do not know this.

45:14.821 --> 45:17.888
Do not interfere with my Alps.

45:20.155 --> 45:22.855
You are creating duality
inside the nomad tent.

45:23.388 --> 45:26.421
You are dissuading and
misleading these brave men.

45:27.021 --> 45:33.788
It is uncertain how many Oghuz
has lost their ways since...

45:35.688 --> 45:39.021
...I have paid my homage to
my brother and Ameer Sadettin.

45:39.588 --> 45:41.821
You cannot disobey the law
of the nomad group, Ertugrul.

45:42.555 --> 45:45.888
You cannot walk over the
rules that Alps and Beys...

45:45.955 --> 45:47.488
...lay down at headquarters.

45:47.555 --> 45:50.388
Sungurtekin.
What do you think you are doing?

45:52.888 --> 45:55.755
I am on my duty of the Oghuz law, mother.

45:58.988 --> 46:04.755
Alps! Draw away from Ertugrul Bey. Now!

46:05.921 --> 46:08.055
This is your last warning.

46:09.121 --> 46:11.488
Sungurtekin Bey is right.

46:12.155 --> 46:14.921
Leaving is offensive to the Oghuz law.

46:17.521 --> 46:19.455
-I am out!
-Me too.

46:19.521 --> 46:21.755
-Me too.
-I am out as well.

46:49.888 --> 46:54.921
For all the rotten Alps
leave the group,...

46:54.988 --> 46:57.488
...now we are together.

47:02.888 --> 47:06.388
Bring it on.

47:08.655 --> 47:12.055
Sungurtekin. Akca Bey.
This is enough, stop!

47:15.555 --> 47:16.588
Sungurtekin Bey!

47:22.621 --> 47:23.921
Our men will not be alone.

47:25.955 --> 47:28.521
If you want to take lives, take ours too.

47:29.555 --> 47:31.455
Do you hear me Akca Bey?

47:33.721 --> 47:39.655
Akca Bey. We are hurt too.
Do not increase our pain.

47:40.355 --> 47:41.955
Call your Alps back.

47:47.721 --> 47:49.588
Brave Alps of the Oghuz!

47:51.455 --> 47:54.021
I would like to remember
that you are always merciful.

47:55.055 --> 48:00.855
Now, shall your weapons hide
in their scabbard and may...

48:00.921 --> 48:03.155
...your anger rest against your mercy.

48:03.688 --> 48:07.455
They may rest, so that our nomad
tent may not suffer any more.

48:08.388 --> 48:11.421
Ertugrul. Do not do this.

48:17.055 --> 48:19.855
-You have to go through me first.
-Mother.

48:20.621 --> 48:23.021
Mother Hayme, what are you doing?

48:23.088 --> 48:27.021
I do not wish them to leave as well.
However, this cannot...

48:27.088 --> 48:30.021
...happen with tyranny.
Give way to my heroes!

48:40.921 --> 48:43.021
Are you still not satisfied?

48:43.721 --> 48:47.521
Is the black soil still
hungry for our men's blood?

48:50.721 --> 48:56.121
What do you wish to accomplish?
How many more graves...

48:56.355 --> 49:01.555
...do you want? Enough. Enough!

49:07.588 --> 49:08.621
Alps!

49:12.355 --> 49:14.855
Put your weapons in their sheath.

49:29.988 --> 49:33.388
Sungurtekin Bey. Do not forget
that you are the head of the Alps.

49:34.921 --> 49:37.088
How could you defy my orders?

49:37.155 --> 49:40.488
I will not let any blood
spill here today, Akca Bey.

49:42.755 --> 49:46.788
Kayi Alps! To the drill field!

50:08.555 --> 50:12.488
Where you go, you will find
much worse trouble than...

50:12.555 --> 50:16.621
...yourselves. When that
happens, you will not find...

50:16.688 --> 50:21.455
...a nomad tent that protects you.
Shame! Such a shame!

50:22.088 --> 50:24.755
To yourselves and to your children.

50:28.155 --> 50:30.021
May you get what you deserve.

50:34.721 --> 50:36.388
You will get what you deserve.

50:48.421 --> 50:50.921
My brave men and women...

50:50.988 --> 50:55.921
...who will pursue Ertugrul Bey,
where you go, may God...

50:55.988 --> 50:58.855
...always protect you.

50:58.921 --> 51:03.921
May you not be in need of bad people.

51:04.688 --> 51:06.455
Amen!

51:06.888 --> 51:11.588
My blessings are always with you.
May God speed you.

51:16.655 --> 51:17.788
Mother.

51:18.988 --> 51:21.355
-My daughter.
-Give us your blessing.

51:24.688 --> 51:25.955
It is yours.

51:41.788 --> 51:48.721
My Gunduz.
May God let you be with your family.

51:50.821 --> 51:56.055
May he give my days to you.
May you have the best of luck.

52:10.121 --> 52:14.488
Ertugrul Bey. May the God
protect you from all kinds of...

52:14.555 --> 52:16.955
...trouble and harm.

52:17.021 --> 52:22.821
Know that you will always be
in my heart.

52:22.888 --> 52:25.088
Thank you Selcan Hatun.

52:25.155 --> 52:28.988
May you be happy with
my brother and your child.

52:29.055 --> 52:31.088
Thank you Bey.

52:39.755 --> 52:43.521
First Turgut and now you.

53:00.488 --> 53:02.521
Give me your blessing Mother.

53:05.821 --> 53:07.588
It is yours.

53:36.988 --> 53:40.821
My brave Alps! My brave sisters!

53:43.455 --> 53:46.655
It is time to show patience to...

53:47.588 --> 53:50.755
...evilness, gratitude to felicity
and consent to the destiny.

53:50.821 --> 53:54.955
You shall know that this is not
a separation but only a reunion.

53:56.988 --> 54:03.388
We will wave our noble tribe flag
everywhere, from west to east.

54:05.355 --> 54:09.821
May God help all people
of the Kayi and Oghuz.

54:09.888 --> 54:12.588
-Amen.
-Amen.

54:24.121 --> 54:27.921
Alps! Let us go on our way.

54:49.721 --> 54:51.455
Ertugrul!

55:12.988 --> 55:15.455
Give me your blessings my brother.

55:18.088 --> 55:19.721
It is yours.

55:20.021 --> 55:23.421
-God speed.
-May God protect you, brother.

59:15.355 --> 59:20.121
Ertugrul will pay the price for
demoralizing the prince and...

59:20.355 --> 59:24.788
...rising up against the state.
Now you must carry out the...

59:24.855 --> 59:26.855
...duty that our prince gave you.

59:28.555 --> 59:31.721
Out state has no more patience.

59:32.521 --> 59:35.721
You will bring the heads of
both Ertugrul and the prince.

59:36.555 --> 59:38.621
And not only him.

59:38.688 --> 59:41.855
Kill everyone who pursue him.

59:41.921 --> 59:45.455
My men are ready to obey
your orders, Ameer Almighty.

59:45.788 --> 59:49.421
Then be on your way
and bring me the good news.

59:49.855 --> 59:52.655
Do not have doubts, Emir your highness.

59:52.988 --> 59:56.555
Ertugrul will not get away
this time, Emir your highness.

00:59:59.021 --> 01:00:00.755
I will take my leave.

01:00:13.121 --> 01:00:17.921
Seeing that you have got a death
wish, seeing that you leave...

01:00:17.988 --> 01:00:24.088
...your nomad tent willingly,
you will see how wolves eat...

01:00:24.155 --> 01:00:30.421
...the stray, Ertugrul. You will see.

01:00:52.388 --> 01:00:55.021
Bogac, how did you survive?

01:00:56.055 --> 01:00:58.588
Did something happen to my brothers?

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:02.155
What are you up to
again you Kobek Sadettin?

01:03:37.388 --> 01:03:39.821
Ertugrul Bey thought us how to be an Alp.

01:03:39.888 --> 01:03:42.521
Ertugrul Bey thought us that
being an Alp is not about just...

01:03:42.588 --> 01:03:45.055
...the wrist but about the heart.

01:03:46.521 --> 01:03:50.021
We should have gone with him.
We should not have left him alone.

01:03:51.055 --> 01:03:55.621
You are right brother. But it is too late.

01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:17.421
Alps!

01:04:23.455 --> 01:04:26.855
It makes us all sad that a
brave Alp like Ertugrul left.

01:04:29.055 --> 01:04:32.388
However you should know that
our nomad group is not...

01:04:32.455 --> 01:04:36.021
...about individuals.
A Bey will come, a Bey will leave.

01:04:36.721 --> 01:04:41.355
Now what we must do is to
train strong willed Beys...

01:04:41.421 --> 01:04:45.855
...and brave Alps so we
can continue serving...

01:04:45.921 --> 01:04:49.521
...our group and state.

01:04:50.788 --> 01:04:54.488
What matters is our group.
Our state. Just like...

01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:58.955
...how you brave Alps came
out to shoulder my father...

01:04:59.021 --> 01:05:02.921
...Suleyman Shah's legacy,
it will keep going like that.

01:05:06.955 --> 01:05:11.121
Now, everyone will get their act
together from this condition...

01:05:12.588 --> 01:05:15.155
...and perform their duties.

01:05:18.155 --> 01:05:21.355
If I see or hear someone not...

01:05:21.421 --> 01:05:24.455
...performing their duties,
consequences will be severe.

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:28.688
Now, it is time to exercise.

01:07:34.488 --> 01:07:35.988
Permission!

01:07:47.388 --> 01:07:51.521
So, everything that I could not believe
about my sons were true.

01:08:05.155 --> 01:08:08.755
Did you provide the
peace and unity of the nomad...

01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:12.155
...group with these gold that
you took from Gundogdu Bey?

01:08:18.921 --> 01:08:22.588
Did you violate Ertugrul Bey's
rights at the headquarters...

01:08:22.655 --> 01:08:24.721
...with this gold?

01:08:26.855 --> 01:08:29.588
Is this the law of Kayi?

01:08:33.121 --> 01:08:37.988
Do you protect the law of our
ancestor Oghuz like this?

01:08:40.721 --> 01:08:43.821
Are you not ashamed of being such people?

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:48.655
When someone hear about this
tomorrow, how will you...

01:08:48.721 --> 01:08:50.788
...look at people's faces?

01:08:52.588 --> 01:08:55.121
Two heads are better
than one, Mother Hayme.

01:08:56.355 --> 01:08:59.588
Gundogdu Bey gave these
for the unity of our group.

01:08:59.655 --> 01:09:02.755
Ertugrul Bey took our brave me from us.

01:09:03.521 --> 01:09:05.355
-And our Suleyman Shah's orders.
-Shut up!

01:09:07.088 --> 01:09:13.755
Who do you think you are?
How dare you say Suleiman Shah's name?

01:09:16.088 --> 01:09:19.888
How do you condescend to tarnish his name?

01:09:21.521 --> 01:09:26.855
You should know, that you would not
invade the position of Bey, Mother Hayme.

01:09:27.621 --> 01:09:30.355
We are silent because
of our respect to you.

01:09:32.455 --> 01:09:35.621
If you have a problem,
talk to your son who is our Bey.

01:09:37.355 --> 01:09:43.355
And you say these without a shame?
Shame on you.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:47.155
Inattentive men who has no way.

01:09:50.688 --> 01:09:53.988
Shame on you. You should...

01:09:55.888 --> 01:10:00.054
...know that you did not just
trample on our peace and unity...

01:10:01.888 --> 01:10:06.121
...but our hope and our law
as well, when you work with...

01:10:11.155 --> 01:10:15.521
...Gundogdu Bey. These gold
should not pass your throat.

01:10:18.955 --> 01:10:23.955
May God strike you.
Curse on you, shame on you!

01:11:11.821 --> 01:11:13.588
Any news from Ertugrul?

01:11:13.655 --> 01:11:16.055
I sent a rider, Bey.
We are waiting for his return.

01:11:18.655 --> 01:11:23.355
Bogac. What are you planning again?

01:11:26.621 --> 01:11:28.521
What are you up to?

01:11:35.888 --> 01:11:38.521
Bey, Ertugrul Bey has turned
towards the narrow gate...

01:11:38.588 --> 01:11:40.155
...with his caravan.

01:11:42.855 --> 01:11:46.588
Open your eyes. We will catch
Ertugrul when he is most...

01:11:48.455 --> 01:11:50.488
...vulnerable and take his head.

01:11:54.988 --> 01:11:57.521
I do now know what you are doing but...

01:11:59.521 --> 01:12:02.155
...I will drown you in your own well.

01:12:56.721 --> 01:12:59.155
Bey. The wheel is broken.

01:13:03.755 --> 01:13:07.755
Bey. Horses are tired as well.
The children are also tired.

01:13:07.821 --> 01:13:09.721
They carry so much.

01:13:13.821 --> 01:13:18.821
Fine. We spend the night here.
Dogan, show the single Alps...

01:13:18.888 --> 01:13:23.988
...where their guarding duties will be.
Married ones will guard their families.

01:13:24.755 --> 01:13:26.388
As you wish Bey.

01:13:26.455 --> 01:13:28.955
Nobody will blink an eye, Bamsi.

01:13:50.621 --> 01:13:52.555
With the name of God.

01:14:07.488 --> 01:14:10.121
So you will
migrate the Kayi group to the...

01:14:10.355 --> 01:14:13.421
...place where Ameer Sadettin said,
in peace and unity.

01:14:14.488 --> 01:14:18.055
Yes, mother. With God's help.
Do not have doubts.

01:14:18.855 --> 01:14:24.955
And, after all this shame,
how will our nomad tent stay loyal...

01:14:25.021 --> 01:14:28.755
...to its law and religion, son?

01:14:33.755 --> 01:14:35.988
What are you saying mother?

01:14:37.455 --> 01:14:42.455
I know all your shames. You and Gundogdu.

01:14:43.555 --> 01:14:44.821
Mother.

01:14:49.021 --> 01:14:56.021
My Dundar was right. Two lions
cannot roar in the same house.

01:14:58.755 --> 01:15:02.021
So we see that this is son of Bey's fate.

01:15:07.055 --> 01:15:10.088
Do not tarnish our...

01:15:11.021 --> 01:15:16.155
...ancestries honor on your
way by listening to strangers.

01:15:19.421 --> 01:15:23.755
We will lose the trust your
father's legacy to us...

01:15:24.788 --> 01:15:29.055
...to the Alps, to the people.

01:15:30.755 --> 01:15:33.521
What would we do without
me and my brother, mother?

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:35.388
Think about it.

01:15:36.621 --> 01:15:39.788
Ameer Sadettin would kill my
brother and become trouble...

01:15:39.855 --> 01:15:43.755
...to our nomad tent.
Then we would lose all, mother.

01:15:48.688 --> 01:15:52.721
We are still on father's peace
and unity way. We always...

01:15:52.788 --> 01:15:55.988
...followed the unity way
that our father showed us.

01:15:56.888 --> 01:16:00.088
Now if we can travel in
peace to our new home...

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:02.355
...it is because of my brother's duty.

01:16:03.721 --> 01:16:07.855
You still dare and talk
to me about Ameer Sadettin.

01:16:08.521 --> 01:16:10.821
That dire man can go to hell!

01:16:12.821 --> 01:16:16.355
Growing up, you have always
said God, my son. Why?

01:16:18.021 --> 01:16:23.921
To buy Beys with gold and
tarnish our marquee's law?

01:16:27.821 --> 01:16:29.888
Did you intend to bring peace
when you overpowered an...

01:16:29.988 --> 01:16:32.621
...innocent prince? You tried
to bring peace with stranger...

01:16:34.921 --> 01:16:39.021
...statements when your brother was here.

01:16:39.121 --> 01:16:41.788
How could you give credit
to that man's words?

01:16:48.088 --> 01:16:52.421
Do not be a stranger to your law
and your nomad group.

01:16:54.721 --> 01:16:58.455
It is your father's legacy to you,
in your hands.

01:16:58.521 --> 01:17:01.855
Do not lose it to other people's hands.

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:09.455
This is what I say. Enjoy your meal.

01:17:53.955 --> 01:17:58.755
<i>Shah Suleyman. You said that</i>
 <i>if you can steal, instead...</i>

01:17:58.821 --> 01:18:03.155
<i>...of a sword it is better to steal</i>
 <i>a staff. You said instead of...</i>

01:18:03.388 --> 01:18:07.488
<i>...the lawless dark, marquees</i>
 <i>would fall, it is better.</i>

01:18:08.721 --> 01:18:12.088
<i>You said instead of only the</i>
 <i>bitter grass that horse do not...</i>

01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:14.388
<i>...eat would not grow, it is better.</i>

01:18:14.455 --> 01:18:17.755
<i>You said that if only the brackish</i>
 <i>marine that you cannot drink...</i>

01:18:17.821 --> 01:18:21.555
<i>...would not flow. You said</i>
 <i>if only the coarse son who...</i>

01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:24.988
<i>...cannot carry out his</i>
 <i>ancestor's legacy was no more...</i>

01:18:26.455 --> 01:18:29.455
<i>...it would be better. You said</i>
 <i>instead of lies that was bought...</i>

01:18:29.521 --> 01:18:32.655
<i>...with gold, it is</i>
 <i>better for marquee to fall.</i>

01:18:33.588 --> 01:18:37.755
<i>Whoever is in pain in the</i>
 <i>marquee, only the Bey of the...</i>

01:18:37.821 --> 01:18:41.788
<i>...marquee would know</i>
 <i>the true pain, you said.</i>

01:18:43.088 --> 01:18:47.721
<i>You said that times can change</i>
 <i>and brothers may be enemies...</i>

01:18:48.788 --> 01:18:52.755
<i>...to each other and only the</i>
 <i>mothers would know the true...</i>

01:18:53.888 --> 01:18:57.688
<i>...burden of the marquee, you</i>
 <i>said. Whatever you said has...</i>

01:18:57.755 --> 01:19:01.388
<i>...become an edict my Bey.</i>
 <i>My sons are strangers to each other...</i>

01:19:01.455 --> 01:19:04.888
<i>...and in this dark marquee,</i>
 <i>your throne is a coffin for us.</i>

01:19:05.921 --> 01:19:11.421
<i>Oh my Shah Suleyman. If it is</i>
 <i>not written in fate, a servant...</i>

01:19:11.488 --> 01:19:16.355
<i>...of God would not have troubles.</i>
 <i>May God protect us...</i>

01:19:16.421 --> 01:19:19.788
<i>...from the shear of being</i>
 <i>lawless and stateless.</i>

01:19:34.355 --> 01:19:39.921
My God. You are all. You are kind.

01:19:41.488 --> 01:19:43.655
Show me the right way.

01:19:45.821 --> 01:19:48.521
Show me so I can go on the right way.

01:19:50.521 --> 01:19:56.088
So on your way, I can gratify
my Shah Suleyman's soul, my God.

01:20:11.921 --> 01:20:14.455
We will catch up with the time we lost.

01:20:14.521 --> 01:20:17.055
However the halt
will discourage the people.

01:20:17.655 --> 01:20:19.921
That is why we should get on our way soon.

01:20:23.555 --> 01:20:26.521
Bey, you were going to take
Noyan and Bogac to the Sultan...

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:29.821
...and prove to him that all the
things that happen to us is a...

01:20:29.888 --> 01:20:34.655
...game of Ameer Sadettin.
But I have nothing in my hands.

01:20:35.655 --> 01:20:38.921
Death of Noyan and escape of
Bogac has put us in a difficult...

01:20:38.988 --> 01:20:42.121
...situation Artuk Bey. We cannot give up.

01:20:42.355 --> 01:20:46.155
Whatever we try and whatever we do,
Kobek will always...

01:20:46.388 --> 01:20:52.388
...follow us. That is why,
we must be even more careful.

01:20:56.155 --> 01:21:00.988
Alps, do not let your guards down.
Even in our marquee...

01:21:01.055 --> 01:21:04.755
...they did not leave us in peace.

01:21:04.821 --> 01:21:08.621
They will do whatever it takes
to create chaos in the caravan.

01:21:08.921 --> 01:21:10.521
What is your order Bey?

01:21:11.121 --> 01:21:14.521
The caravan belongs to the God
first, than it belongs to us.

01:21:15.088 --> 01:21:19.988
If we must, for the sake of
the caravan, we will not sleep.

01:21:21.088 --> 01:21:23.521
Visit the guard Alps frequently.

01:21:23.588 --> 01:21:26.021
As you wish, Bey. They will not be alone.

01:21:27.755 --> 01:21:30.155
Halime. Did you talk with the ladies?

01:21:30.855 --> 01:21:32.888
Does the caravan need anything?

01:21:32.955 --> 01:21:36.555
No, Bey. I have talked with every woman.

01:21:36.621 --> 01:21:40.488
Nobody needs anything.
We have a lot of food.

01:21:40.921 --> 01:21:44.755
Do not ignore the women and the
children. Our way is long and...

01:21:44.821 --> 01:21:47.888
...difficult.
We will not let anyone suffer.

01:21:47.955 --> 01:21:50.421
As you wish, Bey.

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.646
Bey.

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.513
Bey.

01:23:58.513 --> 01:24:01.613
Our Holy Book, Quran...

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.646
...is the way that shows our religion.

01:24:21.646 --> 01:24:22.746
Flag...

01:24:24.046 --> 01:24:28.313
...is the safest place where we raise
our descendants in its shade.

01:24:45.846 --> 01:24:49.713
Swords are a door to
holy battle and conquer.

01:25:06.446 --> 01:25:07.546
Leave and go.

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:13.713
How could I leave your marquee
and go, Bey?

01:25:14.646 --> 01:25:20.780
Every inch of land in world is
our marquee if there is Quran on it.

01:25:22.913 --> 01:25:28.513
Know that our sons will seal their fates.

01:25:30.046 --> 01:25:32.080
They will not deviate from right way.

01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:36.046
Their mistakes will illuminate
their paths.

01:25:36.846 --> 01:25:40.580
They will walk tall and be honorable.

01:25:42.746 --> 01:25:44.080
Do not feel offend.

01:25:45.446 --> 01:25:46.680
Do not offend.

01:25:48.513 --> 01:25:53.813
Be with Ertugrul where
you should be, Hayme.

01:26:34.046 --> 01:26:37.913
Give these three trusts to their owner.

01:26:40.513 --> 01:26:42.280
May God give you a clear path.

01:27:40.413 --> 01:27:42.013
In the name of God.

01:27:48.946 --> 01:27:50.080
God...

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.813
...thank you.

01:27:55.313 --> 01:27:57.546
Thank you, God.

01:28:03.746 --> 01:28:07.046
It is not possible to set out with this,
Ertugrul Bey. It is irreparable.

01:28:07.446 --> 01:28:09.713
How could not you repair it in one day?

01:28:13.046 --> 01:28:15.646
-How long does it take?
-It lasts till evening.

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:25.780
Dogan.

01:28:26.846 --> 01:28:27.980
Bamsi.

01:28:28.713 --> 01:28:29.846
Get ready as soon as possible.

01:28:31.079 --> 01:28:33.780
Let us take Yigit with us
and go to Sultan.

01:28:34.746 --> 01:28:35.946
There is no time to lose.

01:28:38.046 --> 01:28:41.413
Ertugrul Bey, let me come with you.

01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:42.780
Sister.

01:28:44.446 --> 01:28:47.946
We do not know what will happen
on the road. You stay here.

01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.580
What will happen when you go to Sultan?

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.346
What judgment he will give
about you, Yigit?

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:57.580
I do not know whether
they let you live or not

01:28:57.980 --> 01:28:59.946
and whether I see you or not.

01:29:02.946 --> 01:29:04.646
-Artuk Bey.
-Yes, Bey.

01:29:05.546 --> 01:29:08.980
Command the Alps and
caravan is entrusted to you.

01:29:09.613 --> 01:29:11.980
Yes, Bey, do not worry.

01:29:13.846 --> 01:29:16.546
-We will catch you up.
-Alright, Bey.

01:29:17.646 --> 01:29:19.980
Dogan, Bamsi, get ready
as soon as possible.

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.413
We shall set out. Halime Sultan
is coming with us, too.

01:29:32.446 --> 01:29:33.580
Yigit.

01:29:35.013 --> 01:29:36.346
Good bye, brother.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.446
I believe in our Sultan's justice
as my brother does.

01:29:39.713 --> 01:29:41.813
If god permits, he will believe
our innocence.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.046
If god permits, Dundar Bey.

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:46.646
Good bye, brother.

01:30:00.713 --> 01:30:01.780
Come on.

01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:16.580
<i>-Permission, Mother Hayme?</i>
-Come in, Abdurrahman.

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:27.946
You summoned me, Mother Hayme.

01:30:28.946 --> 01:30:31.613
Abdurrahman, prepare the horses.

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:35.313
We shall not leave Ertugrul alone.

01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:38.513
Mother Hayme?

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.080
We will set out as soon as possible.
Be quick.

01:30:45.013 --> 01:30:46.413
Yes, Mother Hayme.

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:52.580
Mother.

01:30:55.513 --> 01:30:57.046
Mother, what are you saying?

01:31:00.013 --> 01:31:01.046
My daughter.

01:31:05.013 --> 01:31:07.613
It is my turn to set out.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.646
Please, do not go, mother.

01:31:12.346 --> 01:31:15.313
Selcan, my beautiful daughter.

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:19.080
I know where I must be.

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:21.546
Please, do not.

01:31:22.313 --> 01:31:24.480
Please, do not. How could I say this
to Gundogdu Bey?

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:26.913
Please, do not leave us alone.

01:31:28.913 --> 01:31:32.013
Selcan, my beautiful daughter.

01:31:33.846 --> 01:31:36.846
I know you will take care of
my son and grandchild.

01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:46.346
You will do your duty as a wife
and as a mother.

01:31:48.513 --> 01:31:52.846
Gundogdu and Sungur
will find the right way

01:31:53.013 --> 01:31:59.046
for their nomad tent's unity
and peace sooner or later.

01:31:59.946 --> 01:32:01.546
I believe it.

01:32:03.413 --> 01:32:06.313
Ertugrul and Dundar on the west of state

01:32:06.446 --> 01:32:09.346
Gundogdu and Sungur on the east of state

01:32:10.413 --> 01:32:16.880
they will carry Suleyman Shah's legacy.

01:32:22.513 --> 01:32:24.813
Your children that are going to born...

01:32:28.346 --> 01:32:30.780
...will be biggest supporters of them.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.313
Mother.

01:32:34.313 --> 01:32:36.813
Daughter. Give me your blessing.

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:40.646
Mother.

01:33:16.813 --> 01:33:18.046
Peace be upon you, brothers.

01:33:18.646 --> 01:33:20.613
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, brother.

01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:23.280
Give me your blessing.

01:33:23.846 --> 01:33:25.880
I go to Ertugrul Bey with Mother Hayme.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:34.980
Staying here preys me on.
I want to come with you.

01:33:35.346 --> 01:33:38.046
Me, too, brother. I cannot stay here.

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:42.346
-I want to come with you, too.
-We want to come too.

01:33:44.046 --> 01:33:45.513
So, prepare then.

01:33:46.313 --> 01:33:48.913
Tell other Alps who want to come.

01:33:49.713 --> 01:33:50.846
We will set out as soon as possible.

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.546
Sungurtekin Bey!

01:34:23.013 --> 01:34:24.013
Bey!

01:34:24.646 --> 01:34:26.446
Bey!

01:34:26.913 --> 01:34:28.813
What happened, Selcan Hatun?
Why do you rush?

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:32.480
Mother Hayme will go after Ertugrul.

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.913
Where did that come from?

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:38.546
Please, stop them or mother will leave us.

01:35:11.713 --> 01:35:13.413
In the name of God.

01:36:00.546 --> 01:36:01.546
Mother.

01:36:10.513 --> 01:36:12.080
Is Selcan saying true?

01:36:13.846 --> 01:36:15.580
We traveled lots of cities.

01:36:17.046 --> 01:36:20.613
Tabriz, Damascus, Aleppo

01:36:20.946 --> 01:36:23.480
Bagdad and Urumqi.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.313
We stood strong, we never beg for mercy.

01:36:29.413 --> 01:36:32.080
In our darkest times, we stood still.

01:36:32.913 --> 01:36:34.746
You will stand still, too.

01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:39.713
Do not ever miss me.

01:36:40.913 --> 01:36:42.780
Give me your blessing, son.

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.680
When Gundogdu comes, hug him tight for me.

01:36:51.046 --> 01:36:54.513
From now on, do not leave each other.

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.580
No, mother. No.

01:36:59.946 --> 01:37:01.680
I could not let you leave.

01:37:02.913 --> 01:37:06.980
You cannot go and leave us,
our father's nomad tent behind.

01:37:09.646 --> 01:37:11.913
We hold in high esteem for you.

01:37:14.013 --> 01:37:15.480
You are really dear for us.

01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:20.413
Do not, mother.

01:37:21.713 --> 01:37:23.313
Do not do it to us.

01:37:30.513 --> 01:37:32.480
Give me your blessing, son.

01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:47.546
You will always be in my heart,
in my prays.

01:37:52.913 --> 01:37:54.713
May God keeps you safe.

01:38:52.613 --> 01:38:53.713
Alps!

01:38:57.013 --> 01:38:58.580
What are you doing?

01:39:00.746 --> 01:39:01.746
Enough!

01:39:03.913 --> 01:39:06.513
I will not let anybody
leave this nomad tent.

01:39:10.646 --> 01:39:12.280
We made up our minds, Bey.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.913
We do not draw sword to our Bey.

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:19.546
We would die for Ertugrul Bey...

01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:28.380
...or by your sword.

01:39:32.046 --> 01:39:33.446
The decision is yours.

01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:54.480
Let us go, son.

01:39:55.946 --> 01:39:59.513
You know, we could not make it here.

01:40:00.713 --> 01:40:02.546
Let us go.

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.880
-My daughter.
-Give me your blessing, mother.

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:54.480
You have it.

01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:25.346
Mother.

01:41:49.713 --> 01:41:50.913
Son.

01:41:53.846 --> 01:41:55.546
My dear son.

01:41:57.713 --> 01:41:59.913
I give my life for you.

01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:30.846
Mother.

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:34.313
Dear mother.

01:42:39.513 --> 01:42:41.046
Give me your blessing, mother.

01:42:45.646 --> 01:42:47.913
You have it, son.

01:42:53.913 --> 01:42:59.313
Now, our nomad tent and our marquee
are entrusted to you and your brother.

01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:07.746
We will never tarnish your name
or my father's, mother.

01:43:08.346 --> 01:43:09.546
I know, son.

01:43:11.313 --> 01:43:12.646
I know.

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:33.546
My mother took our flag
and left, Selcan Hatun.

01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:40.513
As I can see, she thinks honor of Kayi

01:45:41.513 --> 01:45:43.813
should be in Ertugrul's hand.

01:45:46.913 --> 01:45:50.046
Ertugrul came,
rose clouds of dust and left.

01:45:57.646 --> 01:46:00.746
We will not dread, Selcan Hatun.
We will not.

01:46:03.646 --> 01:46:08.280
We will lead Kayis as they deserve
with Gundogdu Brother.

01:46:09.446 --> 01:46:14.913
On the back of our horses as our
ancestors thought us, we will be free.

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.813
Our marquee is so silent

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.780
our hearts are hurt

01:46:26.513 --> 01:46:32.046
even our horses are serving others

01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:35.846
and you are talking about being free, Bey.

01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:10.580
They could not go far while there are
so many women and children in caravan.

01:47:11.446 --> 01:47:12.713
Where are they?

01:47:15.613 --> 01:47:17.380
We must catch Ertugrul up
as soon as possible.

01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:20.746
Mother Hayme, I know a shortcut
over there to Gediklitas.

01:47:20.913 --> 01:47:22.646
If you use that way,
we could catch them up.

01:47:22.813 --> 01:47:25.546
Alright, then. Let us lose no time
and set out.

01:47:52.613 --> 01:47:54.380
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:47:55.713 --> 01:47:58.580
<i>To glorious Seljuk Sultan Aleaddin.</i>

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:02.346
<i>May God let you be ruler</i>

01:48:02.613 --> 01:48:08.446
<i>and let you be only Sultan while</i>
 <i>other emperies are worthless.</i>

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.880
<i>Sultan, our Prophet (phub) said</i>

01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:20.913
<i>"Serving justice for one day</i>
 <i>is better than 60 years of pray."</i>

01:48:22.413 --> 01:48:26.513
<i>I tried to be fair on the mission</i>
 <i>you gave.</i>

01:48:27.846 --> 01:48:32.046
<i>I want you know that</i>
 <i>Sultan's son Yigit took your side</i>

01:48:32.346 --> 01:48:36.846
<i>by distrusting rebellious Oghuz Beys.</i>

01:48:38.713 --> 01:48:42.513
<i>He put his life in danger</i>
 <i>not to fall into trap.</i>

01:48:43.513 --> 01:48:49.046
<i>My brother, Ertugrul Bey,</i>
 <i>put his life in danger to save him.</i>

01:48:50.413 --> 01:48:53.013
<i>I want you know that</i>
 <i>they are not rebellious.</i>

01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:56.746
<i>I believe you will act fair.</i>

01:48:58.813 --> 01:49:00.813
<i>May God let you live long.</i>

01:49:01.946 --> 01:49:04.580
<i>Son of Suleyman Shah, Sungurtekin Bey.</i>

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.580
Take the fastest horses

01:49:46.513 --> 01:49:50.546
and change your horses before
your they die and continue.

01:49:54.513 --> 01:49:56.513
Bring this letter to Sultan Aleaddin
as soon as possible.

01:49:56.613 --> 01:49:57.680
Yes, Bey.

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.313
Get down the horses.

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:43.646
What happened, Yigit?

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:46.780
You beam.

01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:50.813
Today is my happiest day, Ertugrul Bey.

01:51:52.546 --> 01:51:57.080
I have stood still whatever
Sultan's judgment will be.

01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.080
And you were always with me.

01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:06.713
You did not make my sister a Sultan
in palaces but a Sultan in your heart.

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:10.946
So, I will not grieve.

01:52:12.446 --> 01:52:13.846
I want you know that.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:28.346
Our Sultan will listen to us, Yigit.

01:52:29.346 --> 01:52:33.046
When he learns the truth,
justice will be served.

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:36.780
Then, we will live in peace together,
if God permits.

01:52:37.713 --> 01:52:38.813
If God permits.

01:52:41.646 --> 01:52:43.880
Perhaps, our Sultan will exile me

01:52:44.846 --> 01:52:46.880
or let me come with you.

01:52:51.546 --> 01:52:52.780
I do not know.

01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:55.013
Whatever is the result

01:52:55.813 --> 01:52:59.513
I felt the love of family with you
that I have never felt.

01:53:02.513 --> 01:53:06.313
I will always pray for you.
I want you know that.

01:53:11.013 --> 01:53:12.413
Thank you, Yigit.

01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:41.713
In the name of God.

01:53:50.913 --> 01:53:53.780
This is end of the way, Ertugrul.

01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:56.980
Are you the new bastard of Kobek?

01:54:03.946 --> 01:54:05.080
Ertugrul.

01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:08.646
You could not escape this time.

01:54:10.413 --> 01:54:12.646
Do you think you will get away with
what you have done?

01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.513
I will send you to hell as your owner.

01:54:34.346 --> 01:54:35.446
Yigit.

01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:44.746
Alps.

01:54:46.513 --> 01:54:47.546
Attack.

01:55:15.646 --> 01:55:16.946
Them traitor.

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:54.846
Yigit!

01:56:04.446 --> 01:56:05.480
Yigit!

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:07.313
Ertugrul!

01:56:08.913 --> 01:56:10.446
Ertugrul! Gunduz!

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.746
Bamsi!

01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:29.380
Ertugrul!

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:34.646
Yigit!

01:56:36.046 --> 01:56:38.013
Yigit, my brother!

01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:25.046
-Let us go to Ertugrul Bey!
-Wait Bamsi.

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:26.680
We cannot leave Halime Sultan.

01:57:27.846 --> 01:57:30.580
-Sister.
-I am listening, my dear.

01:57:31.313 --> 01:57:34.580
I am cold. It is like
my blood is draining.

01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:44.080
I am cold.

01:57:50.446 --> 01:57:51.746
I am cold.

01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:18.813
Take your hands off my son.

01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:20.846
Your problem is with me.

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:23.380
Stay where you are.

01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:27.480
If you move, your son dies.

01:58:30.413 --> 01:58:31.680
Drop your sword.

01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:35.746
I said drop your sword!

01:58:56.913 --> 01:58:58.946
-Son!
-Mother!

01:59:00.513 --> 01:59:01.580
Son!

01:59:02.446 --> 01:59:05.513
-Mother!
-I could not leave you alone.

01:59:05.946 --> 01:59:07.313
My dear Gunduz.

01:59:12.813 --> 01:59:14.046
My dear Gunduz.

01:59:26.013 --> 01:59:27.346
Bey.

01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:31.413
Forgive me.

01:59:38.713 --> 01:59:40.880
From now on, I will obey
every order you gave.

02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:14.713
Welcome, brother.

02:00:15.846 --> 02:00:17.880
-Welcome.
-Thank you, Bey.

02:00:34.013 --> 02:00:35.446
Yigit!

02:00:42.846 --> 02:00:44.313
God.

02:00:45.946 --> 02:00:48.780
Please do not make me suffer this pain.

02:00:49.846 --> 02:00:52.546
Please, spare my brother's life.

02:00:58.646 --> 02:01:01.313
-Sister.
-Tell me.

02:01:01.546 --> 02:01:04.646
Ertugrul Bey will take Gunduz.

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:08.080
Of course, he will and you will be fine.

02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:31.413
Bey.

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:35.080
Ertugrul! Ertugrul!

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:37.713
Gunduz is here.

02:01:44.413 --> 02:01:45.513
Yigit.

02:01:56.980 --> 02:01:58.780
-Sister.
-Mother.

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:02.580
-Tell me.
-I told you.

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:04.546
I told you.

02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:08.546
Today is my happiest day.

02:02:12.846 --> 02:02:14.046
Ertugrul Bey.

02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:18.080
Give me your blessing.

02:02:19.313 --> 02:02:23.446
I bear witness,
God is the sole divinity...

02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:29.046
...and I bear witness Mohammad is
his servant and his messenger.

02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:22.746
My daughter, may God award him
with heaven.

02:03:25.646 --> 02:03:27.613
May God bless him.

02:03:30.813 --> 02:03:34.413
Yigit died honorably as a brave
Seljuk Sultan's son.

02:03:43.546 --> 02:03:44.946
Yigit!

02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:53.046
Bey, these are Seljuk soldiers.

02:03:56.946 --> 02:03:58.546
Kobek.

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:28.380
Sungurtekin Bey, welcome, sit down.

02:04:34.713 --> 02:04:36.580
Our nomad tent stared
migration preparations.

02:04:36.946 --> 02:04:38.546
We have lot of things to do.

02:04:39.613 --> 02:04:41.746
If you excuse me, I would love
to go back as soon as possible.

02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:43.846
Duty comes first.

02:04:45.346 --> 02:04:47.613
Gundogdu Bey went to Ahlat
as you ordered.

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.713
He will look for place
where we will migrate.

02:04:51.546 --> 02:04:55.046
We will set out as soon as possible.
I want you know that.

02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:58.613
Very good.

02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:04.613
Our Sultan and I are quite pleased

02:05:04.746 --> 02:05:08.913
that two honorable tribes of Oghuz
act together.

02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:15.046
And Ertugrul, I sent a letter to Sultan
because of my duty.

02:05:16.446 --> 02:05:18.980
I reported that my brother Ertugrul

02:05:20.046 --> 02:05:22.980
and Sultan's son Yigit did not
get involved in rebellion.

02:05:26.513 --> 02:05:29.813
Our Sultan will decide it.

02:05:31.913 --> 02:05:35.046
-Alright. If you excuse me.
-Of course.

02:05:35.646 --> 02:05:37.080
Sungurtekin Bey.

02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:42.713
My duty in these lands is over.

02:05:43.013 --> 02:05:46.613
I want to set out to Konya tomorrow.

02:05:47.613 --> 02:05:49.546
As I always told you

02:05:50.013 --> 02:05:55.946
you should be a margrave
for the safety of these lands.

02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:01.846
Also, this is our Sultan's desire.

02:06:05.546 --> 02:06:08.913
I obey Sultan's order,
your Ameer Almighty.

02:06:09.646 --> 02:06:13.780
I want you know that I do everything
for my state till my last breath.

02:06:16.046 --> 02:06:17.813
I have no doubt about it.

02:06:18.613 --> 02:06:24.313
May God speed Dodurgas and Kayis.

02:06:37.346 --> 02:06:40.446
Have a safe journey, Ameer Almighty.

02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:57.046
<i>El-Fatiha</i>  for his spirit.

02:08:34.046 --> 02:08:35.380
My brother.

02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:40.846
You had a hard life.

02:08:43.746 --> 02:08:48.046
You always run not to harm
your state, traditions and...

02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:53.013
...not be toyed by your enemies...

02:08:54.313 --> 02:08:55.980
...through your life.

02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:00.746
You sacrificed your short life...

02:09:02.613 --> 02:09:06.946
...your childhood, everything.

02:09:12.313 --> 02:09:16.713
May God take you to heaven,
my dear brother.

02:09:19.713 --> 02:09:21.680
Daughter.

02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:26.080
He died for you and your baby.

02:09:27.646 --> 02:09:30.046
May God bless him.

02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:33.680
Come on.

02:09:34.846 --> 02:09:36.346
Come on, daughter.

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.613
He was brave as his name Yigit.

02:09:45.713 --> 02:09:49.813
We witnessed he would sacrifice
his life for his state.

02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:01.846
Come on, Halime.

02:10:44.646 --> 02:10:47.713
World is such a place

02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:52.813
where you spend your life
and get nothing in return.

02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:58.280
Do not sink into Adam's wine mystery.

02:10:59.746 --> 02:11:05.480
Do not take your eyes off
the life rack that reaches sky.

02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:11.880
Human beings do not know
sky reaching mystery.

02:11:12.613 --> 02:11:19.313
Every tribe's secret truth
rises step by step.

02:11:21.013 --> 02:11:25.346
Every journey's destination is different.

02:11:26.313 --> 02:11:29.580
Journeys that are not aware of each other

02:11:30.046 --> 02:11:34.880
and a state that has endless boundaries.

02:11:36.046 --> 02:11:38.580
When the time is right

02:11:40.046 --> 02:11:44.380
that state could be in your hands.

02:11:57.980 --> 02:11:59.480
Almighty Ameer.

02:12:02.446 --> 02:12:05.413
I told you not to disturb this council!

02:12:05.646 --> 02:12:07.480
There is something outside
you need to see.

02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:08.580
What?

02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:22.880
Talk! What?

02:12:34.413 --> 02:12:35.680
What is happening here?

02:12:43.813 --> 02:12:46.980
Ameer Almighty, a mad man
left this and run away.

02:12:58.546 --> 02:13:00.780
How? No!

02:13:07.346 --> 02:13:08.613
Ertugrul!

02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:11.880
Ertugrul!

02:13:14.346 --> 02:13:18.046
I will find you wherever you are

02:13:18.346 --> 02:13:22.580
even if you are at the back of beyond.

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:29.280
If I am an Ameer of this state

02:13:29.813 --> 02:13:33.780
if I am glorious Sadettin Kobek

02:13:34.346 --> 02:13:40.546
I will not stop until I level you
with the ground and

02:13:41.613 --> 02:13:46.680
bury you sevenfold below the ground.

02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:09.346
Daughter, I know losing your brother
hurts your heart.

02:14:10.346 --> 02:14:13.946
God gives lives and takes them back.

02:14:17.713 --> 02:14:21.513
Like birth, death is for human beings.

02:14:23.346 --> 02:14:25.346
Yigit joined the choir invisible.

02:14:26.513 --> 02:14:31.813
He lived bravely and fell martyr
bravely as his name.

02:14:36.013 --> 02:14:39.280
No word could ease my pain, mother.

02:14:42.313 --> 02:14:45.346
First my father, now my brother...

02:14:47.746 --> 02:14:50.380
I am just one in this huge world, mother.

02:14:51.046 --> 02:14:52.780
Do not ever say that.

02:14:53.613 --> 02:14:56.013
God is the only One, my daughter.

02:14:56.746 --> 02:14:58.046
Pull yourself together.

02:14:58.813 --> 02:15:00.846
You are a Bey's wife now.

02:15:02.746 --> 02:15:06.313
From now on, we will cry

02:15:07.846 --> 02:15:11.280
and you will wipe our tears.

02:15:13.413 --> 02:15:18.380
If we will fall and you will rise us.

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:24.613
Even if we are perished,
you will stand still.

02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:29.913
You must be sharp,
so your Bey could walk tall.

02:15:32.613 --> 02:15:37.046
Do you know what turns a man to a Bey?

02:15:38.946 --> 02:15:41.913
It is neither his weapon nor his strength.

02:15:42.913 --> 02:15:44.480
What makes him a Bey

02:15:45.346 --> 02:15:50.046
is his Hatun who believes
and supports him.

02:15:51.646 --> 02:15:54.013
Do not forget this, alright daughter?

02:16:05.446 --> 02:16:09.580
Sadettin Kobek will cause trouble when
he finds out what happened to his men.

02:16:09.846 --> 02:16:13.446
Be on the alert. We will be cautious.

02:16:18.613 --> 02:16:21.480
Bey, I completed the mission you gave.

02:16:21.846 --> 02:16:22.980
Thank you, Geyikli.

02:16:34.313 --> 02:16:36.080
Bey, some people are coming.

02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:59.446
Peace be upon you.

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.646
And peace be upon you.

02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:06.780
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:10.480
Son, we are here as your fellow.

02:17:12.046 --> 02:17:15.313
If God permits, you will
restore these land

02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:20.446
with scientists and artisans who will be
on your side on your rightful course.

02:17:28.413 --> 02:17:32.513
Your caravan reminded me first Muslims
who immigrated to Abyssinia

02:17:33.346 --> 02:17:37.046
with guide of Cafer bin Ebu Talib

02:17:37.546 --> 02:17:40.913
and Muslims who immigrated
from Mecca to Madina.

02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:47.680
After hegira, Muslims founded
their state and got strong.

02:17:48.613 --> 02:17:53.780
One day our Prophet ordered
his companions to prepare for umrah.

02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:57.613
Muslims prepared and set out.

02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:04.513
Polytheists who open doors to their
enemies on pilgrimage time

02:18:04.746 --> 02:18:07.646
did not open the doors for Muslims.

02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:12.280
Muslims had set out before
taking Mecca's permission.

02:18:13.013 --> 02:18:16.480
As expected, when Muslims
were close to Mecca

02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:19.413
they understood polytheists
laid an ambush on a place

02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:21.580
which is called as Hudeybiye.

02:18:21.913 --> 02:18:24.646
So, Muslims stopped over there.

02:18:25.646 --> 02:18:28.780
They made agreements with envoys.

02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:33.646
But the agreement was
as polytheists wanted.

02:18:34.713 --> 02:18:41.513
So, our Prophet went back to Madina
without performing a umrah.

02:18:42.913 --> 02:18:48.880
Our Prophet's companions told
this displeasure to our Prophet.

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:56.313
Our Prophet calmed them down
and told them to trust God.

02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:01.980
After the agreement, he had
Sura of <i>Fetih</i>  as divine inspiration.

02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:05.513
God expressed conquer of Mecca by saying

02:19:05.580 --> 02:19:10.546
"Indeed, We have given you, Muhammad,
a clear conquest" to our Prophet.

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:17.913
So, Muslims would have not only umrah
but conquest of Mecca as well.

02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:23.646
May God give conquests to this caravan.

02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:25.513
Amen.

02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:30.680
As he conquered your hearts, other hearts
may be conquered thanks to you.

02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:31.980
Amen.

02:19:32.913 --> 02:19:38.046
If God permits you will serve that
rightful course where you will immigrate

02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:42.813
you will fight for all the world
living that rightful course.

02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:44.080
Amen.

02:19:44.846 --> 02:19:47.813
You will heal wounds
with divine inspiration.

02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:49.046
Amen.

02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:55.980
May God let you found state you dreamt of.

02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:57.513
Amen.

02:20:00.646 --> 02:20:04.446
For believers, every Sura is a glory Sura.

02:20:05.513 --> 02:20:08.046
With the strength we took
from our Holy Book

02:20:08.746 --> 02:20:14.580
it is time to stand up to tyrannies
which reach the skies.

02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:18.713
World labors resurrection.

02:20:20.580 --> 02:20:23.546
Holy Birth is coming with the help of God.

02:20:23.813 --> 02:20:25.280
If God permits.

02:20:26.013 --> 02:20:27.280
If God permits.

02:20:27.613 --> 02:20:29.080
If God permits.

02:20:29.713 --> 02:20:31.380
If God permits.

02:20:46.746 --> 02:20:48.613
In the name of God.

02:20:49.746 --> 02:20:52.980
With the 99 names of God Almighty,
the one who creates us

02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:58.846
and fills our hearts with faith,
who brings things into existence.

02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:10.013
Honorable people of Kayi...

02:21:11.513 --> 02:21:15.580
...courageous women, brave Alps.

02:21:17.413 --> 02:21:20.580
A new life starts now.

02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:23.580
New lands are waiting us.

02:21:25.846 --> 02:21:31.846
There are many castles and hearts
waiting to be conquered.

02:21:33.913 --> 02:21:35.580
On this harsh path

02:21:36.546 --> 02:21:40.446
Ertugrul Bey will take this mission.

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:43.880
From now on

02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:51.313
Bey of Suleyman Shah's nomad tent
and marquee is him.

02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:02.813
From now on, we complain, he atones.

02:22:06.446 --> 02:22:11.380
He leads, we follow.

02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:17.080
We enjoy, he suffers.

02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:20.846
His award

02:22:21.613 --> 02:22:26.080
is working hard and pleasing us.

02:22:40.946 --> 02:22:42.080
Ertugrul Bey.

02:22:43.946 --> 02:22:46.280
Good luck being the Bey of Kayi.

02:23:58.513 --> 02:24:01.613
May God let you be victorious
in both worlds, son.

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:03.513
Amen, mother.

02:24:12.613 --> 02:24:13.846
God...

02:24:15.713 --> 02:24:19.380
...give strength to Ertugrul Bey
to wave his flag.

02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:20.480
Amen.

02:24:20.546 --> 02:24:24.080
-Save him from tyrant's traps.
-Amen.

02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:28.013
God, let this a handful of people
to be victorious

02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:30.713
-who set their minds on your path.
-Amen.

02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:37.046
Give us patience of Eyyub Almighty
who prayed for you on good and bad day.

02:24:37.313 --> 02:24:38.380
Amen.

02:24:38.513 --> 02:24:40.946
-Do not deprive us of your aid.
-Amen.

02:24:41.613 --> 02:24:44.280
Confront us with right people
who are on right way.

02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:45.480
Amen.

02:24:45.613 --> 02:24:48.680
-Do not lessen your love in our hearts.
-Amen.

02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:52.780
-Give us prophet manners.
-Amen.

02:24:53.713 --> 02:24:56.780
-Open seals of our hearts.
-Amen.

02:24:57.413 --> 02:25:00.613
-Open them so we could conquer hearts.
-Amen.

02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:11.880
Good luck with your seigniory, son.

02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:19.780
-Do not deviate from right way.
-Amen.

02:25:28.713 --> 02:25:32.580
Honorable people of Kayi
who do not leave me alone.

02:25:32.980 --> 02:25:34.946
In this holy path

02:25:35.413 --> 02:25:39.746
we will show to world what could
a handful of men can do

02:25:40.346 --> 02:25:45.280
by taking strength from our ancestors.

02:25:47.413 --> 02:25:51.913
The ones who said we could not
and we would perish by non-Muslims

02:25:52.046 --> 02:25:55.613
and the ones who stopped us

02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:59.046
we will shame them with
the state we will found.

02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:03.946
Sun will be our flag
and sky will be our tent.

02:26:05.313 --> 02:26:09.413
We will tremble very ground
and pierce the blue sky.

02:26:10.413 --> 02:26:14.946
We will take our swords as lovers
and have large armies.

02:26:17.013 --> 02:26:20.746
We will be guardians of justice and mercy.

02:26:22.013 --> 02:26:24.980
I swear on my sword

02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:29.713
I will keep my shoulder to the wheel

02:26:30.446 --> 02:26:33.880
and make my descendants
and nomad tent victorious.

02:26:36.013 --> 02:26:38.880
May God help us.

02:26:39.646 --> 02:26:43.913
God is greatest.

02:26:45.813 --> 02:26:50.780
God is greatest.

02:26:56.746 --> 02:27:02.813
From now on, Artuk Bey is the Bey
when I am not around.

02:27:04.813 --> 02:27:09.046
Know that his orders are my orders
and his words are my words.

02:27:13.846 --> 02:27:14.846
Alps.

02:27:22.513 --> 02:27:23.813
From now on

02:27:24.413 --> 02:27:28.313
Turgut Alp is your chief Alp.

02:27:34.046 --> 02:27:36.280
Wait hand and foot.

02:28:15.813 --> 02:28:17.846
<i>In the name of God.</i>

02:28:21.513 --> 02:28:25.413
<i>Indeed, we have given you, O Muhammad,</i>
 <i>a clear conquest.</i>

02:28:31.046 --> 02:28:36.080
<i>That God may forgive for you what</i>
 <i>preceded of your sin and what will follow</i>

02:28:36.513 --> 02:28:41.613
<i>and complete His favor upon you</i>
 <i>and guide you to a straight path.</i>

02:28:41.846 --> 02:28:45.913
<i>And that God may aid you</i>
 <i>with a mighty victory.</i>

02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:57.480
<i>It is He who sent down tranquility</i>
 <i>into the hearts of the believers</i>

02:28:57.546 --> 02:29:01.046
<i>that they would increase in faith</i>
 <i>along with their present faith.</i>

02:29:01.446 --> 02:29:05.413
<i>And to God belong the soldiers</i>
 <i>of the heavens and the earth</i>

02:29:05.813 --> 02:29:10.679
<i>and ever is God Knowing and Wise.</i>
