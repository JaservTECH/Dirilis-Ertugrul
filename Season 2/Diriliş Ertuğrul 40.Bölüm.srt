12:35.434 --> 12:39.434
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:40.461 --> 12:44.127
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:44.705 --> 12:47.705
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:59.053 --> 13:00.053
Is this the sherbet?

13:05.120 --> 13:06.120
Now.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.720
Listen to me carefully.

13:10.387 --> 13:12.087
Those two have something
that belong to us.

13:14.053 --> 13:15.287
We will take it and leave.

13:17.487 --> 13:19.220
We do not want to hurt anyone.

13:21.487 --> 13:24.153
Especially while we have
your wife and daughter.

13:42.953 --> 13:43.953
Nice.

13:45.753 --> 13:49.320
Take this sherbet pitcher to those two.

13:50.487 --> 13:53.920
Take it to them so we take that
belongs to us and leave quietly.

13:56.153 --> 13:58.887
You do not want a blood bath, right?

14:59.453 --> 15:02.287
Help us under the name of El Safi, God.

15:09.287 --> 15:10.287
My God!

15:11.753 --> 15:14.187
Help us under the name of El Safi, God!

15:16.420 --> 15:17.420
My God!

15:19.220 --> 15:23.220
Help us my God for the salvation
of Suleyman Shah's son, Ertugrul

15:23.420 --> 15:26.253
who has rebelled against cruelty for you.
-My God!

15:40.053 --> 15:42.787
Thank God. Thank God we have saved him.

15:43.687 --> 15:44.753
Thank God.

15:45.287 --> 15:46.387
Thank God.

16:30.387 --> 16:31.420
That is it.

16:33.353 --> 16:36.020
Okay, girl. Thank you.

16:38.020 --> 16:39.253
But, hide these well.

16:40.187 --> 16:43.953
I will hide somewhere that even
evil cannot find. You do not worry.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.353
I do not, girl.

16:46.453 --> 16:48.220
You go sleep and I will keep watching.

16:52.087 --> 16:53.153
<i>Do I have permission, Bey?</i>

16:58.087 --> 16:59.087
Come in.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.020
I came here to ask if you
need something, Bey.

17:13.453 --> 17:14.487
No, thank you.

17:14.953 --> 17:16.320
This sherbet is on the house.

17:16.987 --> 17:18.420
You and your daughter drink it.

17:20.087 --> 17:21.153
Thank you very much.

17:24.120 --> 17:26.320
-Have a good evening, Bey.
-You, too.

17:42.787 --> 17:43.787
Take it.

18:05.287 --> 18:06.353
Good night.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.720
Thank you, Father Demir, you, too.

19:44.887 --> 19:45.887
Mother.

19:46.220 --> 19:47.253
Mother!

19:49.820 --> 19:50.853
Ertugrul.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.220
Where is he?
-Ertugrul is safe.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.153
You do not worry.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.120
Mother. Get up.

20:03.087 --> 20:05.253
Mother. Come on, drink it.

20:06.787 --> 20:07.787
Drink it.

20:17.853 --> 20:18.887
How are you feeling, mother?

20:21.387 --> 20:22.387
I am fine.

20:23.687 --> 20:24.753
I am better now.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.120
Thank God.

20:43.187 --> 20:44.187
Selcan.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.287
Come with me.

21:06.487 --> 21:07.687
I was rude...

21:09.420 --> 21:10.887
...and rough to you.

21:13.953 --> 21:17.920
I have disregarded your rights and
friendship in front of everyone.

21:22.087 --> 21:24.020
I have hit you with my damn hand.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.720
I apologize for every single of them.

21:29.786 --> 21:34.453
Bey, you are getting too many burdens
on your shoulders every single day.

21:35.953 --> 21:38.853
We all deserve happiness and peace.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.020
And you mostly.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.953
I know that, you will have it soon,
if God permits.

21:50.853 --> 21:51.887
If God permits.

22:01.353 --> 22:03.287
Selcan.
-Yes, Bey?

22:06.053 --> 22:07.120
I want a child.

22:09.420 --> 22:10.987
I want my bloodline to continue.

22:13.753 --> 22:14.887
That is why

22:15.687 --> 22:17.387
I need to marry with a new woman.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.753
That is okay if you agree with that.

22:32.187 --> 22:35.387
But if you do not accept a second wife

22:37.987 --> 22:39.020
I will divorce you.

22:45.420 --> 22:46.453
Think it thoroughly

22:49.187 --> 22:50.687
and then make a quick decision.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.253
Could you not sleep?

23:53.853 --> 23:56.687
They will request to execution of
my brother in the headquarters tomorrow.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.320
How can I sleep?

24:02.253 --> 24:03.487
Forget about headquarters
and the execution.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.753
Let's talk about you.

24:09.387 --> 24:10.387
Sit down.

24:21.953 --> 24:22.987
And also about my aunt.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.987
Now, I want a child, Ertugrul.

24:37.387 --> 24:38.487
And a peaceful home.

24:40.487 --> 24:42.387
But I could not find both with Selcan.

24:45.253 --> 24:47.953
I have told her. I have told clearly.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.153
I have said that I will have another wife.

24:52.720 --> 24:56.753
I said that stay with me if you agree
or I will divorce you.

24:58.687 --> 24:59.753
What did she say?

25:01.420 --> 25:02.420
Nothing.

25:04.453 --> 25:08.287
Ertugrul, they will talk about your
execution in the headquarters tomorrow.

25:08.820 --> 25:10.387
And see our topic here.

25:12.353 --> 25:14.253
Whatever is the will of god,
it will happen, brother.

25:18.087 --> 25:19.220
Correct. Correct.

25:20.453 --> 25:21.920
Do you have anyone in your heart?

25:24.753 --> 25:27.087
Who is she? Goncagul?

25:29.187 --> 25:30.387
How could you know it?

25:33.253 --> 25:34.753
I understood it while talking to aunt.

25:37.820 --> 25:38.887
My God!

25:40.187 --> 25:43.987
My wife and brother know the thing
that I cannot tell it to myself.

25:48.820 --> 25:52.120
Do not stand against your heart, brother.

25:54.020 --> 25:58.687
However, do not send aunt
to your mother's marquee.

26:00.453 --> 26:01.887
She did not deserve it.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.487
And she could not take it.

26:06.020 --> 26:10.920
Actually, I do not know how she will
take another wife but

26:12.320 --> 26:13.887
you do not divorce her anyway.

27:08.987 --> 27:09.987
Sister.

27:11.253 --> 27:12.287
Forgive me.

27:13.920 --> 27:14.920
Forgive me.

27:31.787 --> 27:32.820
Brother.

27:34.853 --> 27:35.920
Thank God you are fine.

27:41.987 --> 27:43.987
How will we endure this pain, Hayme?

27:46.853 --> 27:47.853
Today my child.

27:50.187 --> 27:51.320
Tomorrow your child.

27:54.187 --> 27:56.020
Where did we make a mistake, Hayme?

27:58.353 --> 27:59.387
My son...

28:01.387 --> 28:02.453
...is not a murderer.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.187
He would...

28:09.253 --> 28:13.153
...rather die thousand times...

28:14.420 --> 28:21.420
...than killing a brave one
from his own blood.

28:26.187 --> 28:27.353
Do you not know...

28:29.120 --> 28:32.253
...your nephew who you fought
with against...

28:33.920 --> 28:35.420
...enemy lots of times?

28:38.453 --> 28:39.687
He has...

28:41.087 --> 28:42.787
...put his life into danger...

28:44.953 --> 28:46.087
...in order to kill...

28:49.387 --> 28:55.720
...that traitor Kocabash.

29:00.820 --> 29:01.887
He has...

29:04.487 --> 29:05.987
...come to nomad group...

29:07.087 --> 29:12.387
...and walked into so many angry Alps.

29:18.353 --> 29:22.720
Have you ever think why?

29:25.353 --> 29:26.387
Why?

29:35.153 --> 29:36.753
I know that I have committed so many sins

29:37.953 --> 29:41.487
so Mighty God punished me
with this pain, Hayme.

29:53.953 --> 29:56.687
Karabek. Be careful with him, brother.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.853
He was there when Noyan got me prisoner.

30:03.853 --> 30:05.087
What are you saying, Ertugrul?

30:05.920 --> 30:09.887
While my hand was being nailed
he was watching heartily.

30:11.787 --> 30:15.087
My God! What kind of a hell this is?

30:20.053 --> 30:21.053
Bey.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.353
Korkut Bey has come to marquee
to see Mother Hayme.

30:27.820 --> 30:28.820
You go, brother.

30:29.853 --> 30:32.320
It will be a long night.
Do not leave mother alone.

31:11.753 --> 31:12.787
Almighty God.

31:14.720 --> 31:15.820
Forgive me.

31:18.320 --> 31:22.853
Forgive my son. Spare my sister
and Hayme's life, too.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.787
Do you feel guilty, uncle?

32:00.053 --> 32:01.287
Do you not, son?

32:04.387 --> 32:06.353
Which one of us is innocent
of these incidents?

32:07.720 --> 32:11.220
Ertugrul? You? Hayme?

32:12.953 --> 32:15.353
It is now too late to find
the answer, uncle.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.487
Decision that will be made
in the headquarters tomorrow

32:21.253 --> 32:24.387
will make two nomad groups
and state desperate.

32:26.353 --> 32:29.787
See the truth and be on Ertugrul's side.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.987
They will not be able
to kill Ertugrul, mother.

33:12.187 --> 33:13.387
They will not be able to kill him.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.020
I will not allow it.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.053
Mother.

33:36.053 --> 33:37.053
Mother.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.220
Mother. Do not move.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.320
Mother. Stop.

33:46.487 --> 33:47.487
Mother.

33:56.953 --> 33:57.953
Mother!

33:58.953 --> 34:00.053
Wait, mother!

34:02.453 --> 34:03.453
Mother!

34:04.320 --> 34:05.320
Midwife!

34:06.253 --> 34:07.253
Midwife!

34:11.253 --> 34:13.453
Call Artuk Bey right now! Now!

34:17.220 --> 34:18.253
Hold on, mother!

34:19.253 --> 34:20.320
Mother, hold on!

34:31.320 --> 34:32.320
Mother.

34:34.187 --> 34:35.187
Mother.

35:00.187 --> 35:02.020
You have matched each other very well.

35:05.853 --> 35:07.253
But the game is over now.

35:08.887 --> 35:11.187
I do not know what you have
in that sinister head of yours

35:11.953 --> 35:16.287
but from now on I will show everyone
how evil you are!

35:18.787 --> 35:20.420
-Sister!
-Shut your mouth, Gokce.

35:20.920 --> 35:24.387
You cannot see their spider webs
that they spined around you.

35:25.487 --> 35:26.487
Get out!

35:30.087 --> 35:32.387
Move! Come, Gokce!

35:33.220 --> 35:34.220
Hanim!

35:37.187 --> 35:39.187
Forgive me, Selcan Hatun.
-What?

35:39.887 --> 35:41.120
Mother Hayme got worse.

35:41.420 --> 35:43.420
You should know that I have
informed Artuk Bey.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.453
What is this noise, Aytolun?

35:59.920 --> 36:01.053
Is there any problem?

36:02.187 --> 36:03.253
Mother Hayme.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.287
Bey, Korkut Bey is here.
He wants to see you.

36:16.820 --> 36:17.820
Let him in.

36:40.053 --> 36:41.820
Did you kill my son, Ertugrul?

36:46.153 --> 36:47.153
Mother.

36:47.720 --> 36:49.753
Mother, I will sacrifice myself for you.
Please do not leave us.

37:02.987 --> 37:04.720
Mother! Mother!

37:13.787 --> 37:14.787
Mother.

37:31.420 --> 37:32.953
What do you want to know, uncle?

37:34.420 --> 37:38.087
Do you want to know the mystery of
Karabek who wants to take my head

37:39.253 --> 37:41.187
by command of Saadettin Kobek

37:41.820 --> 37:45.187
and who is also came from Noyan's table
and stay in your marquee?

37:48.087 --> 37:51.087
My mother has paid the price of me
giving you Kocabash's head

37:51.253 --> 37:54.053
who was trying to destroy nomad group.

37:57.387 --> 37:59.453
So you also want me to ask
for your forgiveness?

38:03.720 --> 38:04.720
Mother.

38:05.787 --> 38:07.853
I will not give my brother to hands
of those infidels.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.253
You stay with us, too, mother.

38:14.220 --> 38:15.287
For the love of God!

38:33.087 --> 38:34.120
<i>I am ready.</i>

38:36.153 --> 38:37.287
<i>I am ready, Bey.</i>

38:40.053 --> 38:44.220
<i>We all are bound up with our death, Hayme.</i>

38:47.287 --> 38:48.687
<i>However...</i>

38:49.953 --> 38:54.253
<i>...those who live in this marquee</i>
 <i>are bound up with more.</i>

38:55.353 --> 38:57.153
<i>They are bound up with world's state.</i>

38:58.253 --> 39:05.187
<i>Neither you nor someone in our blood</i>
 <i>have right to give up.</i>

39:16.120 --> 39:17.887
<i>Those battles which never stop</i>

39:20.053 --> 39:22.320
<i>will be always in our marquee.</i>

39:23.120 --> 39:26.687
<i>Neither you nor marquee's women</i>
 <i>have any right to hesitate</i>

39:27.953 --> 39:30.953
<i>and surrender for any moment.</i>

39:34.120 --> 39:35.220
<i>Now get up</i>

39:37.053 --> 39:42.320
<i>and embrace your blessed pain</i>
 <i>which vouchsafed to every Oghuz woman.</i>

39:45.087 --> 39:48.020
<i>Embrace it as if it is your child.</i>

39:48.720 --> 39:50.320
<i>Embrace your pain with compassion.</i>

39:52.920 --> 39:57.453
<i>You must know that I am with you</i>
 <i>all the time, Hayme.</i>

39:58.287 --> 39:59.453
<i>Suleyman.</i>

40:01.053 --> 40:05.287
<i>You must lead our children and</i>
 <i>nomad group until that blessed time</i>

40:07.087 --> 40:10.120
<i>even world would go upside down, Hayme.</i>

40:12.087 --> 40:13.953
<i>The darkness which will cover the world</i>

40:15.320 --> 40:18.320
<i>will be enlightened by the light</i>
 <i>that will rise from this marquee.</i>

40:36.253 --> 40:37.253
<i>Bey.</i>

40:40.820 --> 40:41.820
<i>Bey.</i>

40:54.787 --> 40:56.820
Gundogdu Bey. Bey.

40:59.253 --> 41:00.320
Gundogdu Bey.

41:01.253 --> 41:02.320
Come on, Bey.

41:07.220 --> 41:08.253
Come on, Bey.

41:09.687 --> 41:10.687
Come on.

41:12.153 --> 41:13.153
Mother.

41:14.353 --> 41:16.987
You go outside, too. Call the midwife.

41:18.187 --> 41:19.787
In the name of God.

43:03.087 --> 43:04.387
I have told you that cur Noyan

43:04.920 --> 43:07.687
will not wait until summer
to battle with nomad group.

43:08.320 --> 43:11.487
You have not believed me.
Your son has paid the price.

43:13.320 --> 43:17.720
And now do you want to clear
your conscience by blaming me?

43:20.253 --> 43:22.320
Tell me, uncle. What do you want?

44:05.153 --> 44:06.287
We are under attack!

44:07.320 --> 44:09.187
We are under attack! It is Mongols!

44:09.753 --> 44:10.820
Wear your weapons!

44:11.087 --> 44:12.887
Artuk Bey, do not leave mother!

44:46.220 --> 44:47.253
Cover the tent!

46:11.129 --> 46:12.829
Mongols have invaded the tent, Bey.

46:12.929 --> 46:14.429
Open the door. Open it!

50:34.796 --> 50:37.463
Die!

50:46.429 --> 50:49.563
Die!

51:32.963 --> 51:33.963
Mother!

52:00.529 --> 52:03.363
Hatuns, are you alright?

52:04.163 --> 52:05.396
Thank God.

52:07.929 --> 52:09.429
Are you allright?

52:24.129 --> 52:25.763
Mother Hayme!

52:31.063 --> 52:33.829
Artuk Bey, is my mother alright?

52:40.529 --> 52:42.229
Thank God.

52:43.096 --> 52:46.029
May God never test anyone like this,
Selcan Hatun.

52:46.996 --> 52:50.063
Hayme Hatun's life in one hand,
yours in the other.

53:01.863 --> 53:04.063
Thank God,
I was able to stop the bleeding.

53:08.096 --> 53:10.963
You got us into this trouble, Ertugrul.

53:12.196 --> 53:14.329
You stubbornness caused this.

53:19.063 --> 53:20.163
Uncle...

53:21.563 --> 53:24.796
..can't you see the Mongols are after
something else?

53:28.196 --> 53:30.963
Even if Tugtekin and Ertugrul is dead

53:31.296 --> 53:34.063
they will never stop their attempts

53:34.129 --> 53:37.363
against the life of
our mothers and sisters.

53:42.029 --> 53:43.363
Enough Uncle.

53:43.896 --> 53:44.963
Enough.

53:47.829 --> 53:49.396
What is your agenda?

53:50.396 --> 53:52.763
Don't you understand
what's going on?

53:52.863 --> 53:55.363
You have done everything to
put me in that cage like a rat.

53:56.296 --> 53:58.229
Look, I got out.

54:00.329 --> 54:02.963
Now I will go to that cage myself.

54:03.263 --> 54:04.763
Do you know why, Uncle?

54:05.229 --> 54:08.329
To make you and all the other Beys
to see the truth.

54:10.163 --> 54:12.463
We will settle our scores
tomorrow at the tribunal.

54:13.363 --> 54:15.929
You will see how Noyan deceived you.

54:16.929 --> 54:22.029
After the trial, I will see your
wretched head rolling on the ground!

54:23.463 --> 54:24.529
Murderer!

55:15.929 --> 55:18.229
We must bring Tugtekin
to the camp immediately.

55:18.296 --> 55:21.196
He will not be able to save me from
execution in his condition, brother.

55:21.563 --> 55:25.196
Everything will come to an end
if something happens to him.

55:28.496 --> 55:30.829
I will leave with Artuk Bey, to see him.

55:32.496 --> 55:34.029
May God help you.

55:35.296 --> 55:36.929
May God help all of us.

55:55.963 --> 55:58.563
This must come to an end
after the tribunal tomorrow.

55:59.463 --> 56:01.129
Every breath Ertugrul takes,

56:01.796 --> 56:05.096
gives birth to tears,
betrayal and more blood.

56:06.896 --> 56:12.829
This sinister and bloody raid is the
ultimate proof of this.

56:13.829 --> 56:17.396
Karabek, do you know
what you are trying to imply?

56:18.263 --> 56:21.396
What does Ertugrul have to do
with this raid?

56:22.929 --> 56:26.929
He was locked in a cage.
He may be executed tomorrow.

56:42.529 --> 56:44.129
Karabek is right.

56:45.829 --> 56:47.563
The nomad has been weakened.

56:48.196 --> 56:52.796
You have gathered the Alps of two nomad
groups outside with Gundogdu, why?

56:54.296 --> 56:56.829
In order to keep them from
fighting each other.

56:58.529 --> 57:02.263
Gumustekin Bey, you will take the Alps of
Dodurga down the valley.

57:02.563 --> 57:04.963
And I will take the Kaya Alps
down the river.

57:05.463 --> 57:08.329
Only the scouting Alps will remain
in the square.

57:08.863 --> 57:13.229
They will secure the both nomad groups
tents and the cage.

57:15.063 --> 57:17.463
Noyan took advantage of this situation.

57:19.363 --> 57:24.029
They attacked the nomad tent to die,
not to gain a victory.

57:25.763 --> 57:29.763
Who would have thought
they would be this mad?

57:29.996 --> 57:30.996
You are right.

57:32.463 --> 57:37.063
The one who's responsible for this is the
murderer of my son Tugtekin, Ertugrul.

57:38.996 --> 57:42.896
May God permit me to see
his beheading tomorrow.

57:46.063 --> 57:47.296
Uncle...

57:47.929 --> 57:54.129
...first Hamza, Abdurrahman
and then our 12 Alps have betrayed us.

57:56.096 --> 57:57.296
You are right.

57:57.996 --> 58:00.496
They were our nomad group's weakest link.

58:01.063 --> 58:03.396
They could not resist the pressure.

58:04.196 --> 58:05.929
They sided with Noyan.

58:06.463 --> 58:12.196
However, neither of them has done
as much damage as Kocabash.

58:13.829 --> 58:16.896
Or did the things he has done
single handedly.

58:17.029 --> 58:18.563
Do you still refuse to see it?

58:18.863 --> 58:21.063
Do not blame Kocabash, Gundogdu.

58:22.263 --> 58:23.963
He was the Alp of my son!

58:24.929 --> 58:26.329
He saved your life!

58:27.329 --> 58:29.063
Ertugrul massacared him!

58:29.863 --> 58:32.296
Choose your words carefully!

58:33.296 --> 58:35.763
Your troubles will never end

58:35.996 --> 58:40.063
if you keep recruiting traitors, Uncle.

58:45.029 --> 58:47.063
What are you saying Gundogdu?

58:49.096 --> 58:51.229
Who will you smear now?

58:53.429 --> 58:58.163
I am talking about the one you hosted
in your late son's bed.

59:01.329 --> 59:02.929
Karabek.

59:03.863 --> 59:05.263
Insolence!

59:07.163 --> 59:08.563
What are you saying?

59:10.963 --> 59:12.263
Insolent!

59:14.396 --> 59:16.196
Get out of my sight Gundogdu!

59:18.963 --> 59:22.329
You should have chosen your words
carefully.

59:22.996 --> 59:25.929
They say that when Ertugrul was
Noyan's captive,

59:26.929 --> 59:29.896
this man was by his side.

59:32.429 --> 59:35.796
I do not want anymore of your
insolence in my marquee.

59:36.363 --> 59:37.563
Get out Gundogdu!

59:38.763 --> 59:39.763
Get out!

59:39.896 --> 59:41.963
Or I will send you.

59:43.563 --> 59:48.063
They say that he was smiling
when that Mongol scum was

59:48.429 --> 59:51.063
driving a nail through my brother's hand.

59:51.329 --> 59:52.463
Enough!

59:56.063 --> 59:57.296
Is this true, Karabek?

01:00:06.396 --> 01:00:09.362
Do you believe that traitor
Ertugrul's words?

01:00:15.496 --> 01:00:17.963
Is it true or not?

01:00:19.863 --> 01:00:22.263
I will lead the tribunal tomorrow.

01:00:23.196 --> 01:00:28.229
If you lie, I will cut off your head
before Ertugrul.

01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:30.996
Gumustekin, enough.

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:34.096
I asked, is it true, Karabek?

01:00:38.163 --> 01:00:40.196
Yes, it is true.

01:00:42.429 --> 01:00:44.263
What are you saying Karabek?

01:00:45.463 --> 01:00:46.996
Were you by Noyan's side?

01:00:51.896 --> 01:00:52.896
Yes.

01:00:54.163 --> 01:00:56.863
But on the orders of Sadettin Kobek.

01:00:57.829 --> 01:01:02.129
I was sent to parley, to compromise.

01:01:04.529 --> 01:01:08.296
However, that bastard did not listen to
any of our words.

01:01:09.363 --> 01:01:10.529
That is all.

01:01:12.763 --> 01:01:14.263
Lying wretch!

01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:16.763
Mind your words.

01:01:17.796 --> 01:01:20.196
Or else you will be worse than
your brother.

01:01:24.963 --> 01:01:29.396
If you are still unsure,
ask Sadettin Kobek yourself.

01:01:31.163 --> 01:01:34.496
You will defend yourselves
tomorrow at the tribunal.

01:01:43.063 --> 01:01:46.529
I will not let this go, Karabek.
You can be sure of that.

01:02:06.296 --> 01:02:09.029
You also fought against Mongols,
I am told.

01:02:10.429 --> 01:02:13.029
They fought worthy of Kayi women, Bey.

01:02:14.829 --> 01:02:16.496
Everyone did their best.

01:02:17.996 --> 01:02:20.796
I used my weapon as my father taught me.

01:02:21.996 --> 01:02:24.963
My Aunt and I supported
your Hatun and sister.

01:02:26.496 --> 01:02:27.529
Are you alright?

01:02:41.363 --> 01:02:45.063
We are alright as long as you are well,
my Bey.

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:51.863
We need your insight and
wisdom at this troubling times.

01:02:53.996 --> 01:02:55.263
Thank you.

01:03:09.563 --> 01:03:11.896
What were you doing with Noyan?

01:03:12.863 --> 01:03:14.229
Tell me the truth.

01:03:19.763 --> 01:03:21.896
Do not treat me like this, Gumustekin.

01:03:23.096 --> 01:03:25.163
You are in need of us, such as everyone.

01:03:26.363 --> 01:03:27.929
You will do as we say.

01:03:29.563 --> 01:03:32.496
Ertugrul will be beheaded
with the decision of the tribunal.

01:03:34.396 --> 01:03:37.196
No one can threaten me.

01:03:38.963 --> 01:03:42.463
Now tell me, are you telling the truth?

01:03:43.229 --> 01:03:46.096
Did you go to Noyan's dump
to strike a bargain?

01:03:47.796 --> 01:03:50.196
Why have I not been noticed?

01:03:50.463 --> 01:03:51.563
Why?

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:56.763
Because it was a secret mission
for the state.

01:04:19.263 --> 01:04:21.129
If you are lying...

01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:24.996
...I will carve your liver out.

01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:32.763
What, have you decided to follow Ertugrul?

01:04:34.229 --> 01:04:36.996
He is out of your reach,
you should know that.

01:04:38.796 --> 01:04:41.063
Ertugrul must die.

01:04:42.529 --> 01:04:44.896
Or you will be finished Gumustekin.

01:04:48.129 --> 01:04:52.396
Sadettin Kobek will get what
he wants, not matter what.

01:04:53.996 --> 01:04:55.396
Never forget this.

01:05:18.929 --> 01:05:20.996
Bey, Tugtekin is alive.

01:05:24.996 --> 01:05:26.563
Where is he?

01:05:26.896 --> 01:05:28.763
-I could not hear, Bey.
-What?

01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:30.929
Keep your eyes peeled.

01:05:31.863 --> 01:05:34.196
Follow everyone, go!

01:06:33.196 --> 01:06:37.096
Good job innkeeper, good job.

01:07:59.163 --> 01:08:00.996
Thank you, my children.

01:08:11.296 --> 01:08:12.529
Hatuns,

01:08:14.129 --> 01:08:15.563
leave me alone with my mother.

01:08:38.429 --> 01:08:40.263
What does Korkut say about this?

01:08:42.996 --> 01:08:44.396
He is furious.

01:08:45.929 --> 01:08:48.496
He blames Ertugrul for the Mongol raid.

01:08:50.563 --> 01:08:52.129
My God.

01:08:55.863 --> 01:08:58.229
What will happen at the tribunal tomorrow?

01:09:02.896 --> 01:09:06.363
Son, tell me the truth.

01:09:08.296 --> 01:09:11.063
Tell, so that we know what to do.

01:09:15.429 --> 01:09:18.029
If Tugtekin does not heal and testify...

01:09:21.463 --> 01:09:24.396
...it is not possible for us to
save my brother, Mother.

01:09:35.429 --> 01:09:39.429
We cannot let Noyan to

01:09:41.263 --> 01:09:43.029
make us suffer any longer.

01:09:47.296 --> 01:09:50.396
We cannot let them kill Ertugrul.

01:09:52.163 --> 01:09:58.129
If this devil Noyan achieves this...

01:09:59.796 --> 01:10:03.263
...it will mean the end of our war...

01:10:04.796 --> 01:10:07.496
...not just our beloved, Ertugrul.

01:10:09.463 --> 01:10:14.396
I will not let them harm Ertugrul,
Mother. Do not worry.

01:10:20.429 --> 01:10:25.329
I wonder, should be bring
Tugtekin to nomad tent?

01:10:27.163 --> 01:10:29.529
Maybe they will stop and think.

01:10:30.163 --> 01:10:35.263
Maybe they will stop trying to
get revenge on Ertugrul.

01:10:36.496 --> 01:10:43.196
No Mother, Ertugrul does not approve to
move Tugtekin in his condition.

01:10:46.463 --> 01:10:49.829
The only thing that will stop the
bloodshed is,

01:10:50.296 --> 01:10:52.829
Tugtekin's recovery and testimony.

01:10:54.863 --> 01:10:56.896
Then the only thing left for us
to do is...

01:10:57.129 --> 01:11:00.163
...to pray to God for
Tugtekin's recovery...

01:11:00.996 --> 01:11:07.963
...and hoping he will testify
at the tribunal.

01:11:09.863 --> 01:11:13.396
My only consolation is
he is with Ibn'ul Arabi.

01:11:14.829 --> 01:11:16.796
I will join them.

01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:19.196
Ask for his blessing.

01:11:20.096 --> 01:11:23.796
I hope you will return with good news.

01:11:26.763 --> 01:11:28.263
God willing, mother.

01:11:30.863 --> 01:11:32.863
At the edge of death...

01:11:35.563 --> 01:11:37.296
...I saw your father.

01:11:38.463 --> 01:11:39.829
Mother.

01:11:50.529 --> 01:11:52.229
He said...

01:11:54.029 --> 01:11:56.496
...do not give up.

01:11:59.829 --> 01:12:01.329
I will not, son.

01:12:08.429 --> 01:12:10.163
He said, whatever happens...

01:12:11.763 --> 01:12:14.896
...do not leave your childrens' sight.

01:12:16.896 --> 01:12:21.496
He said the light,
which will drown the darkness will rise...

01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:28.229
...from that mountain and
engulf the world.

01:12:30.896 --> 01:12:32.763
The whole world he said.

01:12:36.163 --> 01:12:38.429
God willing, mother.

01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:43.229
Rest now.

01:12:50.263 --> 01:12:51.829
Oh, my Bey.

01:13:33.929 --> 01:13:37.329
Finally, Halime Sultan woke up.

01:13:40.329 --> 01:13:41.963
Wake that old man as well.

01:14:12.763 --> 01:14:14.529
What do you want from us?

01:14:19.963 --> 01:14:23.263
The documents of Sungurtekin
you are taking to Konya.

01:14:29.829 --> 01:14:31.496
Who are you? What are you talking about?

01:14:37.329 --> 01:14:40.563
Speak for the sake of Ertugrul's child,
Halime Sultan.

01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:56.329
Or else I will cut that bastard
out out your womb with my bare hands.

01:14:56.896 --> 01:14:58.763
Do as he says, Halime.

01:14:59.396 --> 01:15:03.229
Do what is necessary
for your child's sake.

01:15:10.529 --> 01:15:12.296
Documents are not in this chamber.

01:15:15.963 --> 01:15:17.363
They are at the barn.

01:15:24.263 --> 01:15:28.563
If this is a lie, you both will die!

01:15:30.163 --> 01:15:31.863
Get up! I said get up!

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:34.263
Move!

01:15:51.896 --> 01:15:53.529
In the name of God!

01:16:18.763 --> 01:16:20.929
Where are they? Where?

01:16:28.896 --> 01:16:30.763
I have put them in the saddlebag.

01:16:53.229 --> 01:16:54.563
Come girl, quickly.

01:16:55.496 --> 01:16:56.763
Hurry!

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:17.129
Run to the horses! Horses!

01:17:52.763 --> 01:17:54.096
Brother seems to be dying.

01:17:56.296 --> 01:17:58.229
Are you incapable of saying good words?

01:18:05.263 --> 01:18:07.829
We should carry him to the
nomad tent before he dies.

01:18:08.296 --> 01:18:11.196
He may be useful for once in his life.

01:18:11.963 --> 01:18:15.829
He would die on the way
just to see my bey die.

01:18:16.096 --> 01:18:17.296
Shitface.

01:18:18.063 --> 01:18:22.063
Brother, he carries Mother Hayme's blood.
Why do you say that?

01:18:22.163 --> 01:18:26.429
This devil has no blood.
Pure evil flows through in his veins.

01:18:27.763 --> 01:18:28.929
Blasphemy.

01:18:33.463 --> 01:18:36.263
It is the best thing to do.

01:18:37.563 --> 01:18:40.763
Our only chance is to take him
to the nomad tent.

01:18:41.029 --> 01:18:43.496
If our Bey went to the nomad tent
taking such a risk,

01:18:43.563 --> 01:18:45.829
he must know something.
Use your head.

01:18:46.329 --> 01:18:48.463
Brother, this is a stalemate.

01:18:48.929 --> 01:18:50.796
I am going to the nomad tent.

01:18:52.263 --> 01:18:54.296
I will not let my Bey to be beheaded.

01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:59.863
If anyone tries,
I will rip their heads off like grass.

01:19:00.129 --> 01:19:01.196
Enough is enough.

01:19:02.496 --> 01:19:04.096
Wait, Brother.

01:19:05.129 --> 01:19:07.963
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:19:08.363 --> 01:19:10.763
-We have a guest.
-Welcome.

01:19:11.229 --> 01:19:13.763
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:19:14.063 --> 01:19:15.396
And peace be upon you.

01:19:18.396 --> 01:19:20.963
What is wrong Bamsi? Going to battle?

01:19:21.396 --> 01:19:24.896
I wanted to get fresh air.

01:19:25.096 --> 01:19:26.763
I got hot.

01:19:28.129 --> 01:19:29.463
Sit down.

01:19:29.563 --> 01:19:31.496
I have matters to discuss with you.

01:19:37.396 --> 01:19:41.463
Ibn'ul Arabi, welcome.

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:47.096
Me and my mother are relieved
now that you are here.

01:19:47.863 --> 01:19:51.096
We still remember your sacrifices
for our nomad group.

01:19:51.496 --> 01:19:53.429
We are utterly grateful.

01:19:53.763 --> 01:19:54.929
Thank you.

01:19:55.763 --> 01:19:57.296
How is my Selcan girl?

01:20:12.196 --> 01:20:13.763
How is he?

01:20:15.996 --> 01:20:18.496
We have done all in our knowledge, Bey.

01:20:21.796 --> 01:20:25.096
He is the one who brings
morning out of darkness.

01:20:25.796 --> 01:20:27.929
He is the one who filled the night
with peace.

01:20:29.129 --> 01:20:34.063
He is the one who created the sun
and the moon, moving around each other.

01:20:36.763 --> 01:20:40.863
Science and prayer join together
like the branches of a river

01:20:41.029 --> 01:20:45.796
lead to God's glory and will.

01:20:47.563 --> 01:20:49.796
The rest is in his hands.

01:21:11.829 --> 01:21:13.929
The tribunal will gather
in a short time.

01:21:15.029 --> 01:21:18.496
It is obvious that the judgement of the
tribunal will be his execution.

01:21:19.563 --> 01:21:21.063
Wait.

01:21:21.829 --> 01:21:23.963
You are not the only ones in agony.

01:21:25.363 --> 01:21:28.063
We have gathered here to
discuss what to do.

01:21:34.996 --> 01:21:36.929
Noyan has gone more wild.

01:21:37.329 --> 01:21:41.529
Yesterday he sent the men he bewitched
to the nomad tent to die.

01:21:44.063 --> 01:21:47.296
What are you saying Bey?
What devilry is this?

01:21:47.763 --> 01:21:49.496
Things got out of control.

01:21:50.429 --> 01:21:53.196
Alps are ready, waiting for my orders.

01:21:54.863 --> 01:21:58.863
And the people think that
Ertugrul is being framed.

01:21:59.963 --> 01:22:01.963
We will each do our parts.

01:22:02.296 --> 01:22:07.963
You will bring Tugtekin to the nomad
tent as soon as he opens his eyes.

01:22:13.196 --> 01:22:14.363
Bey.

01:22:16.829 --> 01:22:19.163
Do not leave us here, Bey

01:22:21.496 --> 01:22:25.263
Do not take away the honor
of fighting for our Bey.

01:22:31.763 --> 01:22:35.929
Gundogdu, let these brave warriors
come with you.

01:22:36.263 --> 01:22:39.496
If the God will allow us to
venture through our enemis,

01:22:40.163 --> 01:22:43.896
he will protect us
even with a spider's net.

01:22:44.096 --> 01:22:45.329
Do not worry.

01:22:57.429 --> 01:22:58.863
Okay.

01:22:59.029 --> 01:23:00.429
Thank you, Bey.

01:23:04.996 --> 01:23:07.429
Then wait for us before you
go into the nomad tent.

01:23:07.763 --> 01:23:09.829
We will find a way to get
you into the chamber.

01:23:10.996 --> 01:23:12.963
Thank you.

01:24:53.687 --> 01:24:54.854
What is happening here?

01:25:04.587 --> 01:25:06.054
They are mourning.

01:25:06.254 --> 01:25:08.521
Mourning? What for?

01:25:10.754 --> 01:25:13.954
He sent his men to Mother Hayme's
marquee yesterday for invasion.

01:25:16.154 --> 01:25:17.987
Purely to show his power.

01:25:19.654 --> 01:25:22.254
Purely to tease with
Ertugrul before he dies.

01:25:23.121 --> 01:25:28.087
The men he bewitched have ran into the
arms of death without blinking an eye.

01:25:32.987 --> 01:25:34.721
Where were you?

01:25:34.887 --> 01:25:37.054
Noyan sent me on a mission.

01:27:12.587 --> 01:27:15.621
I was saying farewell
to my brave warriors.

01:27:15.787 --> 01:27:18.087
You did not even let me.

01:27:20.687 --> 01:27:22.787
Tugtekin is alive, Noyan.

01:27:35.221 --> 01:27:36.687
Where is he?

01:27:37.154 --> 01:27:39.321
Ertugrul knows where he is.

01:27:55.754 --> 01:27:59.554
Why are not you by my side?

01:27:59.921 --> 01:28:01.621
Why?

01:28:04.754 --> 01:28:08.721
If Tugtekin goes to the nomad tents
everything will come to an end.

01:28:19.654 --> 01:28:22.087
Cover all the roads
which lead to the nomad tents.

01:28:22.521 --> 01:28:26.321
Tugtekin or not
whoever is going to the nomad tents

01:28:27.054 --> 01:28:31.187
will perish. And I mean everyone.

01:28:35.821 --> 01:28:40.154
I will not let my victory day
turn into my mourning day.

01:28:44.887 --> 01:28:46.654
Come with me.

01:28:59.521 --> 01:29:03.621
Apparently, Hayme Mother's marquee
held against his men.

01:29:48.154 --> 01:29:51.121
Thank God. You came back son.

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.154
Thank God.

01:30:08.854 --> 01:30:14.221
If Ertugrul Bey dies, Noyan's bastards
who killed our brothers last night

01:30:14.521 --> 01:30:16.521
would be victorious.

01:30:16.987 --> 01:30:18.787
Do not forget it.

01:30:19.287 --> 01:30:22.621
-Brothers, we will not allow it.
-We will not!

01:30:23.887 --> 01:30:26.054
-Will we?
-We will not!

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.321
For our Ertugrul Bey.

01:30:28.754 --> 01:30:32.654
For justice, if it is needed
we will be face to face with death!

01:30:33.154 --> 01:30:37.087
We will run the risks
such as those Mogul heathens.

01:30:38.287 --> 01:30:44.154
However they cannot bewitch us
and send us to die.

01:30:46.054 --> 01:30:51.321
We would only die for God
justice and customs.

01:30:56.121 --> 01:31:00.087
We would die for God and justice!

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:04.187
-We would die for God and justice!
-We would die for God and justice!

01:31:06.021 --> 01:31:07.687
We vow!

01:31:09.087 --> 01:31:10.621
-We vow!
-We vow!

01:31:10.854 --> 01:31:11.954
We vow!

01:31:12.054 --> 01:31:14.054
-We vow!
-We vow!

01:31:45.987 --> 01:31:47.221
Yes, Turali?

01:31:47.621 --> 01:31:50.787
They are everywhere Bey,
people cannot breathe.

01:31:56.221 --> 01:31:57.921
May God help us.

01:32:00.587 --> 01:32:03.621
Turali, do not wander around.

01:32:03.754 --> 01:32:06.887
Go to the recovery tent
and do not leave until the evening.

01:32:07.587 --> 01:32:08.854
Go now.

01:33:15.554 --> 01:33:18.087
Mother Hayme, your injury is great.

01:33:18.921 --> 01:33:20.787
Do not come to the tribunal like this.

01:33:21.187 --> 01:33:22.621
We are here.

01:33:23.221 --> 01:33:25.554
We will not leave Ertugrul Bey alone.

01:33:29.921 --> 01:33:35.121
I will not leave alone
any of my warriors in my nomad group

01:33:35.987 --> 01:33:38.021
let alone my son.

01:33:40.221 --> 01:33:41.987
It does not befit me.

01:33:46.021 --> 01:33:49.121
I have gathered you here...

01:33:49.654 --> 01:33:53.954
...to get your approval on a matter.

01:34:01.321 --> 01:34:06.187
Is there any of you
who believe Ertugrul Bey...

01:34:07.187 --> 01:34:10.621
...had participated in such a treachery?

01:34:21.554 --> 01:34:24.321
I am asking for the last time, is there?

01:34:26.821 --> 01:34:31.887
Kayi Tribe exists because of
Ertugrul Bey, Gundogdu Bey

01:34:32.154 --> 01:34:35.121
and your efforts Mother Hayme.

01:34:37.954 --> 01:34:40.654
Suleyman Shah have a
special place in our hearts.

01:34:41.687 --> 01:34:44.887
However you have honoured him adequately.

01:34:46.154 --> 01:34:48.887
May God bless you and your children.

01:34:49.254 --> 01:34:51.187
We would also pray for you.

01:34:54.521 --> 01:34:56.054
Thank you.

01:34:58.321 --> 01:35:01.254
If everyone agrees,

01:35:01.654 --> 01:35:05.187
I want your full obedience
regarding the decisions

01:35:05.821 --> 01:35:10.687
we would make about the accusations.

01:35:12.154 --> 01:35:14.921
We are devoted to you
until we die, Mother Hayme.

01:35:15.521 --> 01:35:17.054
-So do I.
-So do I.

01:35:17.187 --> 01:35:20.321
Mother Hayme, do what is needed
in the name of justice.

01:35:23.587 --> 01:35:25.787
We stand beside you until the end.

01:35:34.287 --> 01:35:35.687
Everything is set, Bey.

01:35:36.154 --> 01:35:38.621
We will not let them take
Ertugrul Bey from us.

01:35:38.821 --> 01:35:41.221
-Beys?
-They approved.

01:35:43.221 --> 01:35:45.854
Ertugrul's Alps are awaiting for you.

01:35:46.021 --> 01:35:48.521
You will lead them to
the nomad tent secretly.

01:35:48.587 --> 01:35:50.654
They are awaiting at the
skirts of Kusgozu Hill.

01:35:50.754 --> 01:35:52.221
Yes, my Bey.

01:36:12.787 --> 01:36:13.987
Gundogdu Bey.

01:36:23.321 --> 01:36:28.221
There is an ominous gloom
in the air Gundogdu Bey, it awes me.

01:36:29.987 --> 01:36:32.154
All people craves one thing.

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:33.821
Justice.

01:36:34.887 --> 01:36:38.521
Merely justice will arise
from Korkut Bey's marquee today.

01:36:39.687 --> 01:36:41.321
Have faith in me.

01:36:41.954 --> 01:36:45.587
I will not surrender to neither
Korkut Bey's grief of his child

01:36:45.721 --> 01:36:48.021
nor to the vengeful yelling of the folk.

01:36:49.821 --> 01:36:52.887
Last night why did you come to my side?

01:36:55.787 --> 01:36:58.854
I pray to God to let

01:36:59.087 --> 01:37:01.887
Ertugrul's innocence would come to light.

01:37:02.854 --> 01:37:04.254
However...

01:37:05.321 --> 01:37:09.787
...I have my concerns about
what would happen to me...

01:37:11.287 --> 01:37:13.721
...if I have to give him
the death penalty.

01:37:15.121 --> 01:37:19.687
As I said my Bey.
All people crave one thing, justice.

01:37:24.221 --> 01:37:26.987
Do not attempt to rebel, Gundogdu.

01:37:28.121 --> 01:37:32.521
Everything will go downhill if you do.

01:37:34.854 --> 01:37:39.821
If the tribunal you gathered
will act unjustly...

01:37:40.954 --> 01:37:43.721
...Oghuz tribes will fall apart.

01:37:44.721 --> 01:37:49.887
Seljuqs, who rely on Anatolia
will fall apart likewise.

01:37:52.654 --> 01:37:55.187
Gundogdu Bey, we will bring
Ertugrul Bey to the tribunal.

01:37:55.821 --> 01:37:57.054
I am coming.

01:39:25.187 --> 01:39:26.621
There are tracks.

01:39:27.587 --> 01:39:29.187
They must be taking Tugtekin
to the nomad tent.

01:39:29.587 --> 01:39:31.054
We should send a word to Noyan.

01:40:00.221 --> 01:40:01.821
They have found them.

01:40:02.587 --> 01:40:04.887
Then, Tugtekin must be on his way
to the nomad tent.

01:40:06.721 --> 01:40:08.121
We need to stop them.

01:40:09.154 --> 01:40:10.321
To the horses!

01:40:19.621 --> 01:40:20.621
Halime!

01:40:43.254 --> 01:40:45.887
This horse cannot move
any step forward.

01:40:48.121 --> 01:40:50.654
There is Ruzgar, Demir Usta.
He can carry us both.

01:40:51.554 --> 01:40:56.054
Halime daughter, you go on.
I would slow you down.

01:40:56.987 --> 01:41:01.687
Look, it is raining. Do not look back
and ride your horse, go on.

01:41:03.121 --> 01:41:07.021
Accomplish Ertugrul Bey's mission.
Go, my child.

01:41:07.287 --> 01:41:11.621
Do no ask of me to leave you
like this and go, Wild Demir.

01:41:12.154 --> 01:41:14.087
I am begging you. Come with me.

01:41:14.754 --> 01:41:19.921
I can stall them for a little more.
Think about your baby

01:41:20.254 --> 01:41:22.887
if you do not think about yourself.
You must go my child.

01:41:24.187 --> 01:41:27.187
-How can I leave you alone, Wild Demir?
-I told you to go, Halime!

01:41:28.021 --> 01:41:30.321
Go! Your mission is more important!

01:41:30.754 --> 01:41:32.087
Go on!

01:42:02.687 --> 01:42:04.087
Stop!

01:42:04.321 --> 01:42:05.787
Alright.

01:42:06.154 --> 01:42:07.521
I will give you what you are after.

01:42:07.621 --> 01:42:08.921
Halime!

01:42:10.254 --> 01:42:11.721
No!

01:42:15.754 --> 01:42:17.187
Here.

01:42:31.521 --> 01:42:32.821
Kill the old man.

01:42:32.987 --> 01:42:34.887
No! No!

01:42:38.021 --> 01:42:40.254
As for Halime Sultan...

01:42:41.921 --> 01:42:44.187
She will be the ornament of Noyan's bed.

01:43:27.821 --> 01:43:29.087
Open the door.

01:43:40.954 --> 01:43:42.554
Do you have good news, brother?

01:43:43.521 --> 01:43:44.954
His condition is bad.

01:43:46.921 --> 01:43:48.854
Let's hope for the best, brother.

01:43:49.321 --> 01:43:51.054
We did the best we could.

01:43:51.587 --> 01:43:53.721
Let's see what our destiny
has in store for us.

01:44:07.954 --> 01:44:09.154
Don't.

01:44:10.221 --> 01:44:12.121
His hands will not be tied.

01:45:12.987 --> 01:45:15.687
You! This is impossible!

01:45:16.287 --> 01:45:18.187
This is impossible!

01:45:26.154 --> 01:45:27.554
The documents!

01:45:42.021 --> 01:45:44.021
Do not worry. There is another copy.

01:45:44.121 --> 01:45:45.921
Well done, my daughter.

01:46:01.187 --> 01:46:05.154
You came just in time, brave man.
Tell us please.

01:46:06.921 --> 01:46:08.654
Who are you with?

01:47:36.954 --> 01:47:38.621
Dumrul.

01:47:49.121 --> 01:47:51.687
-Welcome, brother.
-Thank you, brother.

01:47:52.521 --> 01:47:54.287
How is the situation in nomad tent?

01:47:55.754 --> 01:47:56.921
It is on fire.

01:47:56.987 --> 01:48:00.121
We will put out the fire with
our spit brother, with God's help.

01:48:00.654 --> 01:48:03.987
We will raze their tribunal to the ground.

01:48:04.787 --> 01:48:06.187
Who do they think they are?

01:48:07.721 --> 01:48:09.054
Wretched vultures.

01:48:09.221 --> 01:48:11.254
-I will...
-Brother!

01:48:12.321 --> 01:48:13.821
Enough.

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:15.721
Why would I stop?

01:48:15.921 --> 01:48:18.187
What good would it do?

01:48:24.321 --> 01:48:26.587
Keep him under control.

01:48:27.687 --> 01:48:30.021
There is a tribunal in that nomad tent.

01:48:30.154 --> 01:48:32.554
It is thinner than hair,
sharper than sword.

01:48:33.287 --> 01:48:37.087
Do not ever act without thinking.

01:48:37.854 --> 01:48:39.854
Gundogdu Bey has ordered.

01:48:40.987 --> 01:48:42.787
His order is our command.

01:48:43.154 --> 01:48:44.721
Thank you.

01:48:45.821 --> 01:48:47.754
Let us go and save our Bey.

01:49:39.754 --> 01:49:42.821
They found our track and they are coming.

01:51:06.054 --> 01:51:07.887
The tracks are wiped away.

01:51:08.587 --> 01:51:10.654
They know we are tracking them.

01:51:12.221 --> 01:51:13.854
They are here.

01:51:16.787 --> 01:51:17.954
Follow me.

01:52:08.654 --> 01:52:10.121
Tribunal is ready, brother.

01:52:10.887 --> 01:52:12.821
Beys are coming one by one.

01:52:13.954 --> 01:52:15.521
What do they talk about?

01:52:15.754 --> 01:52:18.754
They do not see anything but blood.

01:52:20.954 --> 01:52:23.621
We wanted Ertugrul to die.

01:52:23.787 --> 01:52:25.921
Now, we have his head.

01:52:28.321 --> 01:52:29.921
Look what happened.

01:52:30.121 --> 01:52:32.054
Our hands shake the most.

01:52:36.621 --> 01:52:38.254
There is more Aytolun.

01:52:39.554 --> 01:52:42.154
Ertugrul saw Karabek with Noyan.

01:52:43.221 --> 01:52:45.154
What are you saying, brother?

01:52:47.854 --> 01:52:50.587
He said it is the secret
of the state and kept quiet.

01:52:51.921 --> 01:52:55.621
I am afraid of losing our way
in ominous forests, Aytulun.

01:52:58.654 --> 01:53:01.021
There is something wrong about this.

01:53:01.987 --> 01:53:03.521
What about Ertugrul?

01:53:05.687 --> 01:53:07.321
Gundogdu is determined.

01:53:07.654 --> 01:53:10.087
He will not give up his brother's head.

01:53:13.221 --> 01:53:17.621
This means the Alps of two nomad
tents will fight, Aytolun.

01:53:20.987 --> 01:53:22.954
I do not have any doubt.

01:53:24.554 --> 01:53:26.154
We took necessary measures.

01:53:32.254 --> 01:53:33.821
What will you do?

01:54:02.187 --> 01:54:03.187
Gokce.

01:54:03.254 --> 01:54:04.787
Yes, Hayme Mother.

01:54:04.854 --> 01:54:07.121
I have to talk to Sercan.

01:54:26.687 --> 01:54:27.887
Dumrul...

01:54:29.254 --> 01:54:31.254
...is bringing Ertugrul's Alps...

01:54:32.287 --> 01:54:35.654
...to nomad tent by carriage.

01:54:37.121 --> 01:54:38.754
Thank God, Mother.

01:54:44.587 --> 01:54:47.054
Gundogdu and I will be at the tribunal.

01:54:48.554 --> 01:54:51.654
If something goes wrong...

01:54:53.121 --> 01:54:55.721
...if something happens to us...

01:54:55.887 --> 01:54:58.887
What are you talking about, Mother?
What can go wrong?

01:55:03.621 --> 01:55:06.321
If a wild horse...

01:55:06.554 --> 01:55:09.154
...loses a child...

01:55:10.687 --> 01:55:12.787
...it will only stop when it's dead.

01:55:15.621 --> 01:55:20.321
Only cliffs with no end will stop him.

01:55:23.954 --> 01:55:28.054
You will fulfill marquee's decision.

01:55:30.587 --> 01:55:32.720
Be at Dumrul's side.

01:55:33.654 --> 01:55:38.954
Do not let those wretches hurt Ertugrul.

01:55:43.521 --> 01:55:45.654
The mission is yours my daughter.

01:55:47.121 --> 01:55:49.854
With great pleasure, mother.
Your wish is my command.

01:56:11.687 --> 01:56:13.121
I am fine.

01:56:46.054 --> 01:56:48.787
Ertugrul will get the end he deserves.

01:56:50.221 --> 01:56:54.921
But, if you try to take
his head immediately...

01:56:56.321 --> 01:57:00.054
...no one can be sure
how the things will end.

01:57:00.921 --> 01:57:04.321
Fix this without anyone knowing.

01:57:05.254 --> 01:57:06.521
Fix it so...

01:57:06.621 --> 01:57:08.854
What are you saying woman?

01:57:09.887 --> 01:57:13.721
Don't you know that Ertugrul is the
reason of what happened last night?

01:57:14.687 --> 01:57:18.587
With his tenacity and ambition he is
putting us through hell that murderer!

01:57:19.987 --> 01:57:21.887
He killed my child as well.

01:57:22.054 --> 01:57:24.621
How can you come and
say these things to me?

01:57:25.287 --> 01:57:27.221
-I am only--
-Enough!

01:57:28.954 --> 01:57:32.887
He will get what he deserves,
from my hands.

01:57:35.021 --> 01:57:38.287
His head belongs to me
according to talion law.

01:57:38.721 --> 01:57:43.687
If I hesitate for a moment,
the civil war will break.

01:57:44.921 --> 01:57:47.587
Do not ever forget
what I said, Aytolun.

01:57:47.821 --> 01:57:48.821
Do you understand?

01:57:51.321 --> 01:57:52.954
I understand, Bey.

01:57:53.954 --> 01:57:55.621
May I, my Bey?

01:57:57.521 --> 01:57:59.521
Come in, my Karabek, come.

01:58:13.254 --> 01:58:14.954
What happened?

01:58:21.187 --> 01:58:22.854
Gundogdu...

01:58:23.887 --> 01:58:25.854
...is looking for trouble.

01:58:27.087 --> 01:58:30.721
I say that you should arrest
him after the tribunal, Bey.

01:58:32.554 --> 01:58:37.121
That wretch's head should
be in your hand until he dies.

01:58:56.721 --> 01:58:57.787
Wait.

01:59:37.721 --> 01:59:41.621
Sheikh, if they get inside,
they will kill us all.

01:59:42.687 --> 01:59:44.054
Don't rush.

01:59:47.087 --> 01:59:50.287
God, who protected his holiness prophet

01:59:50.587 --> 01:59:53.987
from heretics with a spider web
will protect us as well.

01:59:54.254 --> 01:59:55.521
Thank you.

02:00:11.254 --> 02:00:13.121
There seems to be a way out.

02:00:14.054 --> 02:00:15.321
You go look.

02:00:45.887 --> 02:00:48.687
-Ertugrul Gazi!
-Traitor!

02:00:48.821 --> 02:00:50.621
Traitor!

02:00:50.787 --> 02:00:53.687
-Kill him!
-Traitor!

02:00:56.021 --> 02:00:59.021
-Kill the traitor!
-Murderer!

02:01:25.687 --> 02:01:27.954
-Kill him!
-Kill the traitor!

02:01:49.221 --> 02:01:51.687
-Traitor!
-Murderer!

02:01:52.187 --> 02:01:54.587
-Kill, Ertugrul!
-Show him!

02:02:23.521 --> 02:02:24.654
Stop!

02:02:30.754 --> 02:02:32.187
Where do you come from?

02:02:32.787 --> 02:02:34.987
You also asked that
when I was leaving brother.

02:02:35.054 --> 02:02:37.121
I am doing something for Hayme Mother.

02:02:55.921 --> 02:02:57.254
Dumrul!

02:02:59.754 --> 02:03:01.187
Where have you been?

02:03:01.687 --> 02:03:04.987
Do you not know I want to get rid of
this ominous nomad tent at once.

02:03:05.087 --> 02:03:07.821
I do not want to see
Aytulun's face ever again.

02:03:08.054 --> 02:03:09.887
You are still standing there.

02:03:11.054 --> 02:03:12.087
Selcan Hatun?

02:03:12.221 --> 02:03:13.687
What?

02:03:14.587 --> 02:03:15.854
Nothing.

02:03:16.921 --> 02:03:18.721
You may pass.

02:03:19.821 --> 02:03:21.321
Be quick!

02:04:15.949 --> 02:04:21.916
What comes from God, returns to God.

02:04:39.049 --> 02:04:44.316
What comes from God, returns to God.

02:04:44.549 --> 02:04:47.183
Protect us with thy name, God.

02:04:47.483 --> 02:04:50.283
Return to God.

02:05:15.483 --> 02:05:17.283
Long live, Ertugrul Bey!

02:05:25.183 --> 02:05:26.416
Murderer!

02:05:36.583 --> 02:05:38.416
-Let me go!
-Stop it!

02:06:03.449 --> 02:06:06.983
Long live, Ertugrul Bey!

02:06:11.949 --> 02:06:13.183
What is happening to you?

02:06:13.983 --> 02:06:16.549
The cave looks eerie, Noyan. Do not enter.

02:06:39.883 --> 02:06:43.449
Geyikli drew them away from us,
my Sheikh. May God help him.

02:06:43.816 --> 02:06:44.849
Thank you.

02:06:56.016 --> 02:06:57.216
Who are you?

02:07:02.416 --> 02:07:03.483
Where am I?

02:07:07.149 --> 02:07:08.849
Where are you taking me?

02:07:09.116 --> 02:07:13.583
If God permits, we are on a journey to
unseal hearts, son.

02:07:16.116 --> 02:07:17.583
Are we going to make it in time,
my Sheikh?

02:07:18.916 --> 02:07:21.549
-May Hizir help us.
-I hope.

02:08:16.816 --> 02:08:18.783
Murderer!

02:08:19.083 --> 02:08:21.583
-Shame on you!
-Murderer!

02:08:26.916 --> 02:08:30.116
-Murderer!
-Damn you!

02:08:34.083 --> 02:08:35.583
You are nothing but a murderer!

02:08:36.249 --> 02:08:37.883
Justice will be served!

02:08:42.583 --> 02:08:44.083
Your judgement is near!

02:09:00.183 --> 02:09:02.549
Murderer!

02:09:09.216 --> 02:09:10.883
You will suffer!

02:09:12.516 --> 02:09:13.916
Murderer!

02:10:08.483 --> 02:10:10.483
-Murderer!
-Shame on you!

02:10:11.449 --> 02:10:14.516
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

02:10:26.349 --> 02:10:28.149
Murderer!

02:10:28.583 --> 02:10:30.249
Justice will be served!

02:10:34.916 --> 02:10:36.783
You will suffer, Ertugrul!

02:10:52.349 --> 02:10:54.083
May God help us.

02:11:30.149 --> 02:11:32.483
It seems Korkut Bey did not left
anything to chance.

02:11:33.516 --> 02:11:36.149
Looks like they want my brother's head.

02:11:47.083 --> 02:11:48.083
What do you think?

02:11:48.516 --> 02:11:52.016
They say that Ertugrul is responsible for
what happened last night.

02:11:53.816 --> 02:11:56.316
They are furious because Ertugrul's
situation weakened the two nomad groups.

02:12:14.516 --> 02:12:16.249
Do I have your permission, Korkut Bey?

02:12:16.583 --> 02:12:18.216
Permission belongs to justice.

02:12:22.483 --> 02:12:23.983
Let there be justice.

02:12:26.049 --> 02:12:27.349
Let God's justice be served.

02:12:29.383 --> 02:12:30.416
Proceed.

02:12:34.249 --> 02:12:35.783
Brave sons of Oghuz.

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:40.916
Mighty Beys of Kayi and Dodurga.

02:12:43.116 --> 02:12:46.149
We are beginning the trial of
Suleyman Shah's son Ertugrul.

02:12:46.583 --> 02:12:51.149
For our tradition compels us to be just
till the end of time.

02:12:59.216 --> 02:13:03.349
He is guilty of murdering
Seljuk Atabey Ertokush...

02:13:04.983 --> 02:13:09.216
...Dodurga Tribe's Alp leader
Tugtekin Bey...

02:13:11.083 --> 02:13:16.549
...and massacring Kocabash,
the Dodurga Alp.
