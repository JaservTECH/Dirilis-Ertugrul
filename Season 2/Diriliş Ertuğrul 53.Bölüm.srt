00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 53 will start after 12:30 min.

12:30.141 --> 12:34.141
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:43.234 --> 12:46.301
You are going to pay for
what you did to my parents.

12:46.815 --> 12:48.815
What are you saying, Tugtekin Bey?

12:49.982 --> 12:54.082
Don't you see that I risked my life
to find your father's killer?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.882
Go to hell, scumbag!

12:59.515 --> 13:01.015
Put that away!

13:01.782 --> 13:03.615
Know your place, Tugtekin!

13:05.048 --> 13:07.515
Remember that I am the margrave.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.682
Let Halime go, Aytolun.

13:36.782 --> 13:40.682
We learnt that Selcan was meeting
Banu Cicek in secret, Hayme Hatun.

13:48.482 --> 13:50.615
I said let her go!

13:52.015 --> 13:56.548
Let Halime Sultan go
and then we can talk!

14:01.048 --> 14:04.015
Tell Abdurrahman
to go to the marquee

14:04.715 --> 14:07.482
and come back here with
the Dodurga Alps at once.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.182
Why do you want that?

14:11.848 --> 14:13.748
You don't trust me either?

14:15.682 --> 14:21.848
Or do you think it was us
who killed Korkut Bey?

14:27.915 --> 14:31.682
I can't trust any
of these scumbags.

14:31.982 --> 14:34.682
Tell Abdurrahman to go at once.

14:45.382 --> 14:49.748
Abdurrahman, be quick as an arrow.

14:51.848 --> 14:53.448
Go at once.

14:54.048 --> 14:55.848
As you please, Mother Hayme!

15:38.448 --> 15:45.048
Ertugrul, I know this is all your doing.

15:46.748 --> 15:51.715
I don't know who else you may poison
with that venomous tongue of yours,

15:52.182 --> 15:56.415
but I will chop it off. I told you.

15:58.448 --> 16:03.715
I swear I won't die
before I chop your tongue off.

16:06.748 --> 16:07.915
Tugtekin.

16:09.782 --> 16:15.448
What did this traitor tell you
to poison your noble soul?

16:26.415 --> 16:31.382
If my brides were in on this,
why are you here with your swords?

16:32.715 --> 16:35.982
You want to punish them
on behalf of Korkut Bey?

16:37.082 --> 16:41.582
Just like how Gumustekin wanted
to take justice into his own hands.

16:42.882 --> 16:47.715
Quietly, sneakily, treacherously.

16:49.015 --> 16:52.615
-Tell me!
-How do you know this, woman?

16:56.682 --> 16:59.448
Are you curious?
Let me explain.

17:03.015 --> 17:04.748
I know that...

17:08.848 --> 17:11.148
...you killed Duru Hatun and Korkut Bey.

17:17.015 --> 17:19.948
I know that upon
Sadettin Kobek's orders,

17:20.482 --> 17:25.148
you stole the seal given
to Sungur Tekin by Sultan Aleaddin

17:25.448 --> 17:31.815
and took it to Kobek.
And that he gave it to Tankut.

17:32.382 --> 17:34.782
Stand back!
Or I'll kill them both.

17:39.982 --> 17:44.848
Are you afraid that they'll
find out how despicable you are?

17:45.648 --> 17:47.548
You don't know what you are saying.

17:47.615 --> 17:52.048
Stand back. Or else your
grandchild and bride will die.

17:55.915 --> 18:02.482
Gumustekin thinks that he set a trap,
but he'll be trapped by my sons instead.

18:04.748 --> 18:07.782
Ertugrul and Tugtekin
went after him.

18:08.748 --> 18:10.382
You're lying.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.715
They are not powerful enough
to defeat my father.

18:16.382 --> 18:20.382
We have been fighting
scum like you for years.

18:21.882 --> 18:24.615
You don't understand
how powerful we are.

18:27.548 --> 18:31.648
Gokce!
Do you believe their lies?

18:31.715 --> 18:33.015
Tell me!

18:36.815 --> 18:39.415
How ominous people you are!

18:41.382 --> 18:42.982
Both of you, go to hell!

18:44.515 --> 18:46.748
You're not powerful enough for us.

18:47.148 --> 18:49.948
Everyone in your marquee
will die today!

19:13.860 --> 19:15.127
Tugtekin Bey!

19:16.493 --> 19:17.760
Tugtekin Bey.

19:18.060 --> 19:20.860
His blood is halal to you
as your mother's milk.

19:21.060 --> 19:24.360
But do not get overwhelmed
with your anger.

19:29.827 --> 19:32.427
Show your justice to Turkmen
nomad groups, Tugtekin Bey.

19:32.893 --> 19:35.627
And show your justice
to vile Sadettin Kobek.

19:35.927 --> 19:39.627
Thus, you will not end up being wrong
when you are right.

19:46.527 --> 19:48.427
His death will not be that easy.

19:50.493 --> 19:54.393
You will be judged before two Beys
in my state tent

19:55.060 --> 19:58.927
and you will be executed shamefully
before the people, Gumustekin.

20:00.460 --> 20:05.127
Everybody will see how corrupt
you and your sister are.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.460
What are you saying, Tugtekin Bey?

20:13.960 --> 20:16.560
Don't you know me?

20:25.493 --> 20:29.693
I know you are the killer of my mother
and my father, Gumustekin.

20:30.727 --> 20:32.693
You will get what you deserve.

20:55.393 --> 20:56.627
Aytolun!

20:57.627 --> 20:58.793
Do not!

20:59.060 --> 21:00.827
Let my brides go!

21:01.660 --> 21:02.927
Take me.

21:05.393 --> 21:07.960
No one can harm you
as long as I am with you.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.360
If you want to be saved, take me.

21:13.060 --> 21:14.827
And then do whatever you want.

21:15.127 --> 21:17.760
-Mother!
-Daughter!

21:30.460 --> 21:36.827
From now on, your share is death.

21:39.593 --> 21:40.893
It is over.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.627
After you die,
no one will learn the truth.

21:48.660 --> 21:50.427
No! No!

22:00.627 --> 22:01.827
Aunt!

22:17.027 --> 22:18.560
Aunt!

22:30.060 --> 22:31.593
-Aunt!
-Selcan!

22:31.660 --> 22:32.660
Aunt!

22:36.727 --> 22:39.560
Halime daughter! Daughter!

22:48.060 --> 22:49.893
-Daughter!
-Are you okay, Mother Hayme?

22:49.993 --> 22:52.560
-Go follow them, go!
-As you please, mother.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.660
Daughter Halime.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.560
Halime.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.327
Halime!

23:07.460 --> 23:09.627
-Daughter!
-Halime.

23:23.760 --> 23:28.327
You are a snake, you nested in my tent.

23:30.493 --> 23:33.560
How did you kill
those innocent people without pity?

23:35.093 --> 23:38.960
This is a trap of Ertugrul.

23:41.727 --> 23:46.527
See the truth Tugtekin.
Or it will be too late.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.593
Both my mother and my father...

23:52.327 --> 23:53.960
How did you kill those people?

23:54.627 --> 23:58.127
This is heartless!

23:58.960 --> 24:01.027
Talk, you damned, talk!

24:02.660 --> 24:04.793
They are the killers of your father.

24:04.893 --> 24:07.660
They killed your father Tugtekin.

24:08.327 --> 24:09.960
Do not believe them.

24:11.427 --> 24:16.527
The anger of Ameer Sadettin
may destroy our nomad group.

24:17.860 --> 24:19.693
Come to yourself.

24:20.493 --> 24:22.693
You will pay the price for everything.

24:29.327 --> 24:33.393
Take me to Ameer Sadettin.

24:34.860 --> 24:37.693
Then you will see the truth!

25:36.960 --> 25:38.727
-Halime!
-Daughter!

25:38.827 --> 25:41.427
Halime I am begging you, open your eyes.

25:42.327 --> 25:43.593
-Mother, Halime!
-Daughter.

25:44.027 --> 25:46.893
Gokce, go to the nomad group
and call for help.

25:46.993 --> 25:49.793
We need to take Halime
to the nomad tent. Hurry up!

25:49.893 --> 25:51.393
I will.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.327
Daughter.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.493
God save her.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.793
God, help us.

25:59.427 --> 26:00.660
Daughter!

26:00.893 --> 26:02.893
I am not afraid of you.

26:03.327 --> 26:09.360
I am afraid that our nomad group
may come to grief.

26:21.027 --> 26:22.493
Tugtekin Bey!

26:23.393 --> 26:26.827
No one becomes lofty when
he treats grimly to a tyrant.

26:28.527 --> 26:29.693
Stop!

26:33.327 --> 26:38.993
He deserves to die in shame in front of
his nomad group. Let it be like that.

26:48.393 --> 26:51.493
It is over, Tugtekin Bey. It is over.

26:52.493 --> 26:54.827
All of them will get their deserts.

26:54.993 --> 26:56.693
Come on.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.693
Come to yourself. Come.

28:33.093 --> 28:34.493
Goncagul!

28:41.560 --> 28:43.660
Either you will come with me

28:43.793 --> 28:46.460
and consent to the penalty that court
will give you and your father

28:46.660 --> 28:48.627
or you will die in here.

28:48.993 --> 28:50.327
I will die.

28:50.593 --> 28:54.593
I may die, but you will die with me.

29:22.393 --> 29:25.093
-Gokce Hatun! Are you okay?
-I am okay.

29:25.327 --> 29:27.593
Hurry up. Halime Sultan is dying.

29:27.793 --> 29:30.460
Come on, inform the nomad group
to call for help.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.727
-We found the killers of Korkut Bey!
-Where are they, Gokce Hatun?

29:32.960 --> 29:35.527
They are near the stream bed.
Come on, help them immediately.

29:35.627 --> 29:37.393
Be quick. Tell them to take a gurney.

29:39.827 --> 29:40.993
Give me the horse.

29:50.493 --> 29:52.127
I will kill you!

29:54.827 --> 29:57.093
Stop right here, corrupt woman.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.827
It is not that easy.

29:58.927 --> 30:01.960
I will not be easy on you as aunt Duru.

30:02.727 --> 30:05.860
Show me if it is easy to kill a person.

30:06.327 --> 30:08.027
Come on!

30:08.627 --> 30:11.660
Show me if it is as easy to kill someone

30:11.760 --> 30:14.860
as you say you love Gundogdu
by looking his eyes.

30:31.327 --> 30:33.127
I loved him.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.360
I loved him so much.

30:35.493 --> 30:38.893
If it was not for your cursed tenacity,

30:39.793 --> 30:42.527
I would have given birth to the babies
that you could not.

30:42.593 --> 30:44.327
I do not believe in your love.

30:44.460 --> 30:47.793
Now decide, you will die here
in my hands

30:48.027 --> 30:51.760
or in the hands of
Gundogdu. It is your choice.

30:59.627 --> 31:01.927
Halime, daughter.

31:06.660 --> 31:11.793
God, please do not make my son suffer.

31:16.793 --> 31:18.127
Oh God!

31:20.827 --> 31:21.993
Daughter.

31:23.827 --> 31:25.793
Horses will be here in a minute, mother.

31:26.627 --> 31:27.827
Okay, daughter.

31:27.993 --> 31:31.327
Halime, Halime.
I am begging you, open your eyes.

31:34.527 --> 31:36.493
God help us!

32:10.593 --> 32:13.593
You should know one more thing
before you die, Goncagul.

32:13.793 --> 32:17.527
I am bearing Gundogdu's child.

32:39.327 --> 32:40.560
Selcan Hatun!

32:46.460 --> 32:47.560
Selcan Hatun!

32:48.727 --> 32:50.327
-Selcan Hatun!
-Where is she?

32:50.393 --> 32:51.660
-She escaped.
-Hurry up, go!

32:51.727 --> 32:53.627
-If you are fine, I will follow her.
-Go!

33:05.527 --> 33:07.327
Thank God!

33:08.460 --> 33:11.427
I found the black knot where I lie down.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.827
Thank God!

34:28.960 --> 34:32.627
Aytolun and Goncagul intented
to kill Halime Sultan.

34:32.727 --> 34:35.060
I saw them while they were getting out
of the nomad tent.

34:35.127 --> 34:38.527
They put on their weapons, so that is
why they were leaving that fast.

34:38.593 --> 34:39.993
Look at those betrayers!

34:42.627 --> 34:44.760
They are in cahoots with Gumustekin.

34:44.993 --> 34:47.493
Alps went to take Halime Sultan.

34:47.727 --> 34:51.093
Yes, it seems that they are
creating trouble.

34:57.493 --> 34:59.727
-Mother.
-Selcan.

35:00.360 --> 35:01.560
Mother.

35:01.627 --> 35:05.493
-How is she? Is she fine?
-She is still unconscious.

35:05.993 --> 35:07.360
Where is Goncagul?

35:07.460 --> 35:10.127
She escaped, mother.
Abdurrahman went after her.

35:10.627 --> 35:15.427
But she conduced to find
the remedy for Gundogdu.

35:15.493 --> 35:17.660
Those blacks knots are
the remedy for my Bey.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.327
I found the mushrooms and
she will come to grief.

35:21.660 --> 35:24.093
Go daughter, rush it. Come on.

35:24.793 --> 35:26.093
Alright, mother.

35:38.093 --> 35:40.893
Goncagul escaped, Mother Hayme.
I could not pick up the trail.

35:45.627 --> 35:48.093
Perform a funeral salaat for Aytolun.

35:48.827 --> 35:51.027
Take her! I do not want her to bemire
my land anymore.

35:51.093 --> 35:52.627
As you please, Mother Hayme.

35:53.360 --> 35:58.127
When you turn back to nomad group,
charge 20-25 Alp to follow Goncagul.

35:58.627 --> 36:00.093
As you please, Mother Hayme.

36:07.027 --> 36:08.493
Come on, be quick.

36:09.093 --> 36:10.493
Slow down.

36:12.727 --> 36:13.893
Slow down.

36:26.127 --> 36:27.327
Daughter.

36:32.027 --> 36:33.960
There is no time to lose, Tugtekin Bey.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.760
We have to go back to the nomad tent
and make a court.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.460
The beys of two nomad groups
need to see the truth.

36:39.860 --> 36:41.360
They need to know.

36:46.360 --> 36:49.460
The Turkmen nomad groups that accepted
the mangraveness of Gumustekin

36:49.693 --> 36:52.327
must stick by the decision of court.

36:52.727 --> 36:55.027
On the contrary, we will take on
not only Ameer Sadettin

36:55.327 --> 36:57.360
but also Turkmen nomad groups.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.760
-Turgut.
-Yes, Bey.

37:02.127 --> 37:03.827
Wake this undignified up. We are going.

37:04.393 --> 37:05.560
As you please.

37:14.427 --> 37:15.760
Wake up, jackal.

37:25.460 --> 37:26.927
It is time to payoff.

37:28.693 --> 37:31.860
I will see your corrupt head rolling
in the middle of the nomad group.

37:33.327 --> 37:35.527
You will all get your deserts.

37:36.493 --> 37:39.727
Your eyes say different things!

37:40.093 --> 37:42.460
The light has gone out of your eyes
because of fear.

37:44.860 --> 37:49.860
Stray into us. Let us see your height.

38:06.893 --> 38:09.927
Ertugrul, if he will not speak,

38:10.493 --> 38:12.960
we can not prove his connection
with Ameer Sadettin.

38:13.593 --> 38:18.493
We do not need a proof, we need to
bring Ameer Sadettin to his knees.

38:18.893 --> 38:20.693
And this day will come eventually.

38:21.327 --> 38:22.527
Alright.

38:24.593 --> 38:25.660
We are ready, Bey.

38:26.060 --> 38:27.060
Let us go.

38:57.627 --> 38:58.660
Take it, Bey.

39:05.360 --> 39:09.827
Gundogdu, I am begging you, please eat it.

39:10.727 --> 39:11.960
Open your mouth.

39:18.860 --> 39:21.560
Come, have one more spoon.

39:23.627 --> 39:25.093
<i>Can I come in, Bey?</i>

39:29.060 --> 39:31.493
Artuk bey, they took Halime Sultan.

39:35.327 --> 39:36.493
Isak.

39:38.427 --> 39:40.727
Stay here with Selcan Hatun.

39:40.860 --> 39:43.627
Make Gundogdu bey have this medicine.

39:43.993 --> 39:45.560
Do not worry, Bey.

39:47.693 --> 39:50.060
For the sake of El Shafii.

39:50.393 --> 39:53.393
The remedy for Bey is those
mushrooms, Selcan Hatun.

39:53.893 --> 39:55.927
He will be better, if God permits.

39:56.527 --> 39:59.093
If God permits, Artuk Bey.

40:10.993 --> 40:13.693
Almighty God will heal him.

40:14.327 --> 40:17.893
Everything is from God, Selcan Hatun.

40:18.993 --> 40:22.127
If God permits, dervish Ishak.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.593
Come on, Bey.

40:44.627 --> 40:47.493
Hold on Halime, I am begging you, hold on.

40:48.593 --> 40:50.660
You and your baby will be better.

40:50.727 --> 40:52.927
-Mother.
-Daughter.

40:53.127 --> 40:55.827
Daugther, this too shall pass.

40:56.493 --> 40:59.960
Hold on Halime, please hold on. We came.

41:03.760 --> 41:07.393
Slow down, do not shake her. Slow down.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.060
How is Gundogdu, Artuk Bey?

41:12.327 --> 41:15.460
Selcan Hatun came just in time
with the remedy, Mother Hayme.

41:15.527 --> 41:17.327
He will be better, if God permits.

41:17.860 --> 41:19.060
Oh God.

41:32.027 --> 41:33.693
They are taking the killer.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.393
Killer! Killer!

41:38.960 --> 41:40.860
You will get your deserts.

41:46.093 --> 41:48.793
Give the killer of our Bey to us.
Give him to us.

43:06.760 --> 43:07.960
Ertugrul.

43:08.327 --> 43:10.893
Do not worry Hayme Hatun,
we will take care of her.

43:59.593 --> 44:03.927
From now on, you will curse
every breath you take.

44:05.460 --> 44:10.060
Even if you kill me, you can not escape
from the anger of Ameer Sadettin.

45:29.827 --> 45:31.560
I am your mangrave.

45:32.393 --> 45:37.727
You can not escape from the anger
of Ameer Sadettin!

45:42.593 --> 45:45.693
Yesterday, you are met as a mangrave
in this nomad group.

45:46.893 --> 45:49.693
But now you are met as a miserable dog.

45:50.727 --> 45:55.727
Your owner will get his share from
this merry day eventually, do not worry.

46:07.627 --> 46:09.727
Aytolun is dead, Gumustekin.

46:16.593 --> 46:18.427
And Goncagul escaped.

46:19.060 --> 46:24.627
But when they find her, she will get
the punishment that she deserves.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.593
And you will get your deserts.

46:39.960 --> 46:43.360
Mother Hayme, if you permit,

46:44.093 --> 46:47.927
I want the Beys of two nomad groups
to judge this dog.

46:48.093 --> 46:52.460
We will do whatever it takes
to administer the law, Tugtekin Bey.

46:57.660 --> 47:00.327
Kayi tribe, Dodurga tribe!

47:01.360 --> 47:02.993
Today is the justice day.

47:03.560 --> 47:06.127
We beared this killers for a long time

47:06.460 --> 47:08.627
like a tumor that is stuck
on to our fleshes.

47:08.727 --> 47:12.760
We washed ourselves with the blood
they spill for the purpose of remedy.

47:12.993 --> 47:15.793
We accepted this killers to our state
tent, to our headquarters.

47:16.127 --> 47:21.027
We considered them brothers,
sisters, mothers.

47:22.360 --> 47:25.493
But it is time to cut off this tumor.

47:25.960 --> 47:27.727
I know this wound will not recover.

47:27.927 --> 47:32.027
We will carry this wound
inside us until we die.

47:32.427 --> 47:34.660
This is a lesson for us
and we will carry it

47:34.793 --> 47:37.527
so that we will not come across with
a shame like this again.

47:39.327 --> 47:43.827
May God not give a pain,
a shame to us again.

47:44.493 --> 47:45.893
Amen Bey, amen.

47:51.893 --> 47:56.827
All of you believed
in the lies of Ertugrul.

47:59.493 --> 48:04.360
You rised against the state
and killed my sister.

48:06.993 --> 48:12.760
The calamity of two nomad groups
will be a lesson to the whole world.

48:14.393 --> 48:20.093
Everybody will see that the blood of the
rebels is halal.

48:26.027 --> 48:31.493
You will not be freed
even if you apologize.

48:39.827 --> 48:45.027
Turgut, take Gumustekin to latticed tent
until the judgement starts.

48:45.427 --> 48:46.727
As you please, Mother Hayme.

48:46.960 --> 48:49.393
Get up!

48:49.460 --> 48:51.860
You will all get your deserts.

48:51.960 --> 48:53.760
-Walk!
-Do not talk, corrupt man.

49:02.693 --> 49:03.993
Is everyone all right, mother?

49:07.727 --> 49:12.360
They tried to kill Selcan and Halime.

49:13.427 --> 49:14.827
Selcan is fine.

49:15.793 --> 49:19.627
But Halime took a knock.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.660
Artuk Bey is with her.

49:41.093 --> 49:42.360
Artuk Bey!

49:42.460 --> 49:47.327
Do not worry Bey, Halime Sultan and
your child are healthy. Praise be!

49:48.727 --> 49:49.960
Thank you.

49:50.860 --> 49:53.327
-Can I go in?
-Of course.

49:53.493 --> 49:55.860
Halime Sultan is looking forward to you.

50:04.660 --> 50:05.827
Ertugrul!

50:08.593 --> 50:09.827
Halime Sultan!

50:11.593 --> 50:14.793
Ertugrul, our child is all right.

50:17.393 --> 50:19.693
Thank God, you are all right as well.

50:20.360 --> 50:22.427
I was frightened Ertugrul.

50:22.727 --> 50:25.060
I was frightened that
I could not protect it.

50:25.793 --> 50:28.360
God gives and takes the life,
Halime Sultan.

50:29.593 --> 50:31.793
You saved the honor of our nomad group.

50:32.760 --> 50:36.593
My child and I will pride with you
throughout our lives.

51:51.660 --> 51:54.493
Take your hands off me!

51:54.560 --> 51:56.093
I am your mangrave.

51:56.860 --> 51:58.893
You can not do this to me.

52:19.927 --> 52:23.893
They said God may give hellish torture
when you are alive.

52:24.327 --> 52:26.327
I saw it with my eyes now.

52:26.993 --> 52:28.927
Thank to God who showed this.

52:29.360 --> 52:30.827
Amen.

52:53.093 --> 52:54.493
Come on, let us go.

53:11.660 --> 53:13.460
Ertugrul!

53:18.593 --> 53:20.960
Ertugrul!

54:36.660 --> 54:39.860
We found the killers of you and my father.

54:40.860 --> 54:42.527
We inflicted punishment on them.

54:43.493 --> 54:45.693
Instigations are over at last.

54:47.727 --> 54:49.027
Rest in peace.

54:51.760 --> 54:55.560
Thank God, I got rid of the delusion
I got in.

54:56.727 --> 55:00.527
I will be a Bey that is proper to you
and my nomad group.

55:01.060 --> 55:06.893
The betrayers, tyrants, cruels will be
far from our nomad group.

55:34.627 --> 55:35.793
Bey.

55:41.727 --> 55:44.327
You proved that you are proper
to Dodurga tribe.

55:46.427 --> 55:47.793
From now on, feel easy.

55:48.393 --> 55:50.527
Your mother and father rest in peace.

55:54.793 --> 55:55.993
Bey.

56:07.627 --> 56:10.060
Please, do not entomb me alive.

56:15.093 --> 56:16.993
How can I trust you Gokce?

56:19.493 --> 56:20.860
I believed in you.

56:21.427 --> 56:22.693
I loved you.

56:24.327 --> 56:25.960
I made you my wife.

56:27.960 --> 56:30.827
Don't you see that you entomb me
while I am alive?

57:14.727 --> 57:16.560
How is my brother, Selcan Hatun?

57:16.627 --> 57:18.893
If God permits, he will not collapse.

57:19.793 --> 57:20.893
If God permits.

57:24.327 --> 57:28.393
Sungur, Ertugrul, is it over?

57:28.893 --> 57:32.093
It is over, brother. We brought
Gumustekin to the nomad group.

57:32.993 --> 57:34.927
And the other two snakes?

57:34.993 --> 57:38.727
Aytolun is dead, but Goncagul
escaped, brother.

57:40.927 --> 57:43.760
That corrupt will get what she deserves.

57:43.960 --> 57:45.127
If God permits.

57:47.060 --> 57:49.827
As I have brothers like you,

57:50.727 --> 57:52.993
as I have a wife like Selcan,

57:53.560 --> 57:55.993
Kayi tribe will overcome anything.

57:59.993 --> 58:04.360
I did not respect your words, forgive me.

58:11.927 --> 58:13.360
Brother.

58:15.793 --> 58:18.793
Artuk Bey said he needs to rest.

58:19.560 --> 58:22.093
Gundogdu will be all right, do not worry.

58:22.793 --> 58:24.993
Give that corrupt what he deserves.

58:25.060 --> 58:26.560
Thank you, sister in law.

58:57.633 --> 58:58.799
May God bless you.

58:59.733 --> 59:01.699
You saved Dodurga tribe from this trouble.

59:03.466 --> 59:04.699
Peace came to my nomad group.

59:06.399 --> 59:07.599
What did we do Cicek Hatun?

59:08.666 --> 59:09.733
If you were not here

59:10.099 --> 59:13.399
lots of blood would spilled and maybe
truth will not be revealed.

59:19.433 --> 59:22.733
If you have a trouble,
you know where I am.

59:26.699 --> 59:27.733
Excuse me.

59:30.533 --> 59:31.533
Banu Cicek Hatun!

59:37.533 --> 59:40.766
Where will I find you
when our nomad groups

59:43.466 --> 59:44.599
migrate to different places?

59:47.933 --> 59:50.933
Know that you are always in my heart.

59:54.499 --> 59:55.566
Dogan Alp.

01:00:19.066 --> 01:00:23.466
Helpless Turkmen nomad groups
who suffer from Mongol trouble

01:00:24.366 --> 01:00:27.033
will be crushed in the hands
of Gumustekin and Kobek.

01:00:28.599 --> 01:00:32.366
When Turkmen seigniory learn
about the court and it's result

01:00:32.866 --> 01:00:36.566
they will understand the trouble they are
saved and they will justify us.

01:00:39.566 --> 01:00:43.366
After the court, Sadettin Kobek us
a hard time like a wild creature.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:48.633
In that time, the support of Turkmen
seigniory will be important for us.

01:00:50.033 --> 01:00:54.399
The justice of our court will cut
the indefility as a knife.

01:00:56.099 --> 01:01:03.099
Artuk Bey, lead the headquarter court
if Tugtekin Bey considers it appropriate.

01:01:03.699 --> 01:01:06.899
Mother Hayme says right.
My anger hinders my justice.

01:01:07.899 --> 01:01:12.066
If you consider it appropriate,
I have to do what my duty requires.

01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:17.133
I do not want to behead him.

01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:21.599
If Ertugrul Bey did not wake me up
from that woolgathering

01:01:22.366 --> 01:01:24.133
my halters would be in the hands
of that cur.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:28.066
They would fool around my nomad group.

01:01:30.066 --> 01:01:31.099
Beheading...

01:01:32.466 --> 01:01:34.733
...Gumustekin is Ertugrul Bey's duty.

01:01:41.466 --> 01:01:44.999
Tugtekin Bey, beheading Gumustekin
is halal for you.

01:01:45.633 --> 01:01:47.666
Ertugrul Bey, I insist.

01:01:49.633 --> 01:01:51.399
When he perish

01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:56.733
I want to look into him in the eye
and give hellfire to his heart.

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:02.933
Fine Tugtekin Bey, fine.

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:30.866
Ameer Almighty.

01:02:31.933 --> 01:02:34.999
Ertugrul enslaved our mangrave
and took him to nomad tend.

01:02:37.099 --> 01:02:38.366
What the hell are you saying?

01:02:39.399 --> 01:02:43.566
Tugtekin Bey and Sungurtekin coalesced
and arrested me and my soldiers.

01:02:44.933 --> 01:02:46.866
-Tugtekin Bey?
-Yes, Ameer Almighty.

01:02:47.899 --> 01:02:49.133
Three of them coalesced.

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:54.599
They said Gumustekin Bey and
you are both betrayers.

01:02:55.433 --> 01:02:58.399
So they raised against the state at last.

01:03:01.133 --> 01:03:03.599
Recruit your soldiers,
we are going to Kayi tribe.

01:03:03.899 --> 01:03:04.966
As you please, sir.

01:03:54.933 --> 01:03:58.733
The Beys of two nomad group brought me
to the head of court

01:03:58.933 --> 01:04:01.499
because I do not have kindredship
with Korkut Bey.

01:04:02.066 --> 01:04:05.566
All we want is the justice Gumustekin Bey.
Understand this.

01:04:10.399 --> 01:04:14.366
None of you can judge me.

01:04:19.999 --> 01:04:22.899
I know that in this tent court

01:04:23.799 --> 01:04:28.766
not justice but instigations
of Ertugrul will win.

01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:34.933
I will exclude this court and
the decision of that court.

01:04:36.633 --> 01:04:38.699
Know that.

01:04:39.066 --> 01:04:40.633
The court is about to start.

01:04:41.433 --> 01:04:43.833
If you have something to tell,
you can tell it when you are on trail.

01:04:44.566 --> 01:04:45.566
Sit down.

01:04:46.433 --> 01:04:48.766
I will not kneel in the face of no one.

01:05:05.999 --> 01:05:10.632
The one who created and filled
our hearts with belief.

01:05:10.933 --> 01:05:16.132
With the 99 names of God.
In the name of God.

01:06:31.966 --> 01:06:38.066
Goncagul learned that Selcan went to pick
up black knot alone from Dervish Ishak.

01:06:38.799 --> 01:06:40.999
It is obvious that she informed Aytolun.

01:06:42.533 --> 01:06:43.933
Is this true, Dervish Ishak?

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:45.733
It is true, Artuk Bey.

01:06:50.399 --> 01:06:51.866
What happened then Hayme Hatun?

01:06:53.566 --> 01:06:56.866
Aytolun and Goncagul followed my brides.

01:06:58.099 --> 01:07:01.399
I took Abdurrahman Alp with me
and followed them.

01:07:02.099 --> 01:07:06.066
I found them while attempting
to kill my brides.

01:07:08.499 --> 01:07:09.499
Lie.

01:07:10.933 --> 01:07:12.099
It is all lie.

01:07:13.799 --> 01:07:15.699
My sister and daugter are innocent.

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:17.999
They are innocent.

01:07:21.033 --> 01:07:23.066
I had to get Aytolun killed.

01:07:24.966 --> 01:07:26.366
And you Selcan Hatun?

01:07:26.899 --> 01:07:29.766
You told that you followed Goncagul
while she was escaping.

01:07:30.366 --> 01:07:32.399
What happened then?
-I found her.

01:07:32.866 --> 01:07:35.999
She wanted to kill me with her dagger
and I protected myself.

01:07:36.499 --> 01:07:40.633
But then she escaped. That is all I say.

01:07:43.066 --> 01:07:48.999
Sungurtekin Bey, what happened
when Gumustekin Bey catched

01:07:49.366 --> 01:07:51.633
Ertugrul Bey and Banu Cicek? I want
to listen it from you one more time.

01:07:52.099 --> 01:07:56.399
As Ertugrul and Tugtekin Bey said,
he disclaimed everything.

01:07:56.966 --> 01:07:58.899
But just because we want the justice

01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:01.999
we took him to the nomad group,
presence of Beys.

01:08:03.133 --> 01:08:04.833
The decision is belongs to our court.

01:08:06.133 --> 01:08:07.899
Do you have something to say,
Gumustekin Bey?

01:08:09.533 --> 01:08:11.366
When this damn game is finished

01:08:12.566 --> 01:08:14.366
I hope you will all get your deserts.

01:08:15.733 --> 01:08:19.333
You will answer for this.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:25.066
Do you have something to say,
Ertugrul Bey?

01:08:28.133 --> 01:08:29.999
<i>I wish I would kill him before.</i>

01:08:34.066 --> 01:08:36.866
Somebody else is at the back
of that case, Artuk Bey.

01:08:38.733 --> 01:08:40.533
Gumustekin Bey's crime is firm.

01:08:41.099 --> 01:08:46.333
I want you to give him one more chance
to confess the murders

01:08:46.533 --> 01:08:49.733
which is encouraged by Sadettin Kobek.

01:08:51.133 --> 01:08:54.866
We would do a beneficent thing

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:58.066
by revealing the betrayer before he die.

01:09:02.833 --> 01:09:05.799
Is it true, Gumustekin? Will you confess?

01:09:43.333 --> 01:09:48.066
I will not submit to your lies Ertugrul,
I will not.

01:09:49.666 --> 01:09:56.366
Not only you but also all the the Beys
who participated your lies

01:09:57.533 --> 01:09:58.999
get their deserts.

01:10:00.699 --> 01:10:06.966
Ameer Sadettin call to account from
the fools who believes your lies.

01:10:07.799 --> 01:10:09.799
Gumustekin Bey, know your limit!

01:10:14.633 --> 01:10:18.033
I do not afraid any of you.

01:10:19.733 --> 01:10:23.899
You will pay the price. You will.

01:10:57.666 --> 01:10:58.999
Son of Konur Alp, Gumustekin.

01:10:59.733 --> 01:11:03.633
According to the witnesses,
you are guilty.

01:11:04.599 --> 01:11:10.533
It is proved that you, Aytolun Hatun and
Goncagul Hatun commited these murders.

01:11:11.999 --> 01:11:13.866
You will get your deserts.

01:11:19.933 --> 01:11:23.666
Tugtekin Bey, have you got anything to say
about the execution?

01:11:24.533 --> 01:11:25.799
Reprisal is your right.

01:11:27.966 --> 01:11:30.099
I want the execution to be
made by Ertugrul Bey.

01:11:31.566 --> 01:11:33.466
He saved the pride of two nomad groups.

01:11:35.633 --> 01:11:37.433
I want to see his eyes while dying.

01:11:41.666 --> 01:11:45.033
Alps, take the guilty in front of the
state tent for the execution.

01:12:07.899 --> 01:12:09.133
Kill him!

01:12:11.533 --> 01:12:12.699
Kill him!

01:12:18.999 --> 01:12:21.333
My people, I am slandered!

01:12:22.533 --> 01:12:24.433
Do not believe in the lies of Ertugrul!

01:12:25.466 --> 01:12:28.133
Kill him! Kill him!

01:12:31.699 --> 01:12:33.433
Do not believe in his lies!

01:12:34.899 --> 01:12:36.033
Do not believe in!

01:12:36.433 --> 01:12:38.066
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

01:12:46.633 --> 01:12:47.833
Kill him!

01:12:49.466 --> 01:12:51.599
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

01:12:52.499 --> 01:12:53.666
We want justice!

01:12:57.699 --> 01:12:58.866
We want justice!

01:13:00.633 --> 01:13:03.633
Brothers, do not do it!

01:13:06.399 --> 01:13:08.799
Do not be a tool of his slanders.

01:13:09.666 --> 01:13:10.799
I am innocent.

01:13:12.433 --> 01:13:16.733
Aytolun Hatun and my daughter
are innocent.

01:13:19.699 --> 01:13:21.666
They seduced the innocents.

01:13:22.933 --> 01:13:24.466
They killed my sister.

01:13:27.066 --> 01:13:31.633
Ameer Sadettin will pay off all from you.

01:13:35.099 --> 01:13:36.733
I am your mangrave!

01:13:38.099 --> 01:13:39.399
Do not do this!

01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:42.466
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

01:13:48.066 --> 01:13:49.366
Kill him!

01:13:52.899 --> 01:13:54.432
Kill him!

01:14:06.933 --> 01:14:11.099
It will be brought to book from everyone
that killed the mangrave.

01:14:12.899 --> 01:14:15.833
You all will be punished by state!

01:14:19.433 --> 01:14:21.599
All of you. All of you.

01:14:28.633 --> 01:14:31.666
Think about the answer you will give
in the presence of God, Gumustekin Bey.

01:14:34.333 --> 01:14:35.399
Tell Shahada.

01:16:02.033 --> 01:16:03.699
Ameer Sadettin Kobek!

01:16:13.066 --> 01:16:17.499
I am ordering you for the sake of
Sultan Aleaddin Keykubat!

01:16:18.999 --> 01:16:20.133
Stop the execution.

01:16:28.699 --> 01:16:29.733
Ertugrul...

01:16:32.599 --> 01:16:34.133
...put that sword.

01:16:40.933 --> 01:16:42.399
I came here to find

01:16:42.733 --> 01:16:48.466
out and release the unfounded claims
about mangrave.

01:16:55.533 --> 01:16:56.733
Beys of two nomad groups

01:16:57.899 --> 01:17:02.933
judged not the mangrave but the murderer
of Korkut Bey and Duru Hatun.

01:17:04.733 --> 01:17:05.833
He will be executed.

01:17:08.533 --> 01:17:12.833
Ertugrul, do not go beyond the limits!

01:17:15.033 --> 01:17:16.066
Soldier!

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:21.666
Ameer Sadettin Kobek, I heard myself

01:17:21.966 --> 01:17:26.866
that Aytolun and Goncagul killed
Korkut Bey and his wife Duru Hatun.

01:17:27.733 --> 01:17:29.066
I am witness for this situation.

01:17:31.066 --> 01:17:32.933
What is the blame of Gumustekin?

01:17:33.633 --> 01:17:35.366
He used his sister and daughter.

01:17:36.866 --> 01:17:38.999
He commited the murders
in order to be a mangrave.

01:17:40.666 --> 01:17:44.599
He used both Kayi tribe and Dodurga
tribe to attain his aim.

01:17:47.133 --> 01:17:48.699
Have you got any proof Ertugrul Bey?

01:17:49.099 --> 01:17:52.933
I am witness as well, Ameer Sadettin.

01:17:55.966 --> 01:17:59.066
Lie! It is all lie, Ameer Sadettin.

01:18:00.633 --> 01:18:04.699
He poisoned both Hayme Hatun
and Tugtekin Bey with his lies.

01:18:05.933 --> 01:18:06.999
It is all lie.

01:18:14.733 --> 01:18:17.733
Hayme Hatun, Tugtekin Bey.

01:18:21.399 --> 01:18:26.099
Now I will take Ertugrul and Gumustekin
to Kervansaray.

01:18:28.066 --> 01:18:29.433
And I will question them.

01:18:32.866 --> 01:18:37.766
Revealing the truth will be my duty.

01:18:42.933 --> 01:18:46.866
Otherwise, the Beys of two nomad groups

01:18:47.933 --> 01:18:51.799
will be considered as a rebel
against the state!

01:19:01.066 --> 01:19:06.699
I will not hesitate to do
what has to be done.

01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:16.833
This is my last warning.

01:19:23.599 --> 01:19:27.633
You dig your own grave, Ertugrul.
You dig your own grave.

01:19:29.333 --> 01:19:33.666
We do not afraid of dying for the
sake of Yusuf. Graditute to God!

01:19:36.799 --> 01:19:38.933
I am telling you for the
last time, Ertugrul.

01:19:43.033 --> 01:19:44.433
Give me my mangrave.

01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:57.833
Soldier!

01:20:49.599 --> 01:20:51.799
Now you can take your mangrave,
if you want!

01:21:02.466 --> 01:21:05.033
Do not think that you will not
pay the price, Ertugrul.

01:21:07.499 --> 01:21:08.599
From now on

01:21:09.733 --> 01:21:15.733
you will deserve what the enemy
of state deserves.

01:21:28.533 --> 01:21:30.066
Shame on you too.

01:21:34.099 --> 01:21:35.566
Shame on all of you!

01:21:40.466 --> 01:21:41.933
Now, afraid of me.

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:46.733
Afraid of the anger of the state!

01:21:50.733 --> 01:21:53.833
Hereupon you will forget the peace
when you enter your tents

01:21:54.699 --> 01:21:57.599
you will forget sleeping
when you go to bed!

01:22:01.099 --> 01:22:03.833
The ones who forgot the loyalty
to the state

01:22:05.699 --> 01:22:08.866
and be loyal to Ertugrul

01:22:11.999 --> 01:22:13.566
will pay the price.

01:23:05.933 --> 01:23:06.933
Kayi tribe!

01:23:09.433 --> 01:23:10.499
Dodurga tribe!

01:23:11.933 --> 01:23:14.133
You are the glorious children of Oguz!

01:23:15.566 --> 01:23:19.466
I see the fear in your eyes
which I have never seen before!

01:23:23.899 --> 01:23:28.466
The fear that I have never seen
in a disaster or in a war!

01:23:31.599 --> 01:23:35.499
I know that, this fear comes from

01:23:36.999 --> 01:23:39.733
your millenarian state love
and obey to the Ameer.

01:23:43.633 --> 01:23:48.433
But do not afraid of Ameer
who is the piece of garbage!

01:23:50.366 --> 01:23:51.866
Do not dread!

01:23:55.766 --> 01:24:00.066
Because, you are always
stand by your state!

01:24:02.399 --> 01:24:04.533
And you will always stand by your state.

01:24:06.999 --> 01:24:10.399
It is our duty to stand in front of them

01:24:12.399 --> 01:24:16.799
with justice instead of have a fright from
the devils that are lurking in the state!

01:24:19.333 --> 01:24:25.033
Now go, mourn for the people that the
sinister murderers took from you.

01:24:27.499 --> 01:24:28.766
May God rest them in peace.

01:24:29.099 --> 01:24:30.433
-Amen!
-Amen!

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:34.766
We were fair, we acted
with respect to God!

01:24:36.999 --> 01:24:39.033
We avoided to revolt to God!

01:24:41.699 --> 01:24:46.966
Undoubtly, God is the one
who sees what we do.

01:24:48.666 --> 01:24:50.099
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:24:50.666 --> 01:24:52.366
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:24:52.633 --> 01:24:54.099
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:24:54.499 --> 01:24:55.899
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:57.699
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:24:57.933 --> 01:24:59.399
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:24:59.766 --> 01:25:01.133
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:01.533 --> 01:25:02.866
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:03.066 --> 01:25:04.599
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:06.366
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:08.033
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:08.599 --> 01:25:10.033
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:10.399 --> 01:25:11.799
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:12.133 --> 01:25:13.733
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:13.966 --> 01:25:15.666
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:15.866 --> 01:25:17.433
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:17.633 --> 01:25:18.999
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:19.399 --> 01:25:20.866
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:21.066 --> 01:25:22.599
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:22.866 --> 01:25:24.399
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:24.633 --> 01:25:26.133
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:26.533 --> 01:25:27.933
God bless you Ertugrul Bey!

01:25:52.833 --> 01:25:53.899
Is he still got fever?

01:25:54.499 --> 01:25:55.633
Not reduced, Bey.

01:26:11.999 --> 01:26:13.733
Can you give us a second, Selcan Hatun?

01:26:14.533 --> 01:26:15.566
Do not worry.

01:26:16.333 --> 01:26:17.966
Artuk Bey will do what has
to be done, Selcan Hatun.

01:26:34.499 --> 01:26:36.766
I will go deeper and take off
the purulence.

01:26:37.899 --> 01:26:41.699
It is going to hurt too much Gundogdu Bey,
you had better hold him tightly.

01:26:55.799 --> 01:26:58.466
You ruined Ameer Sadettin's
reputation, Bey.

01:26:59.099 --> 01:27:00.399
He will make a trouble.

01:27:00.833 --> 01:27:03.099
Sadettin Kobek will not chase
after two nomad groups.

01:27:03.799 --> 01:27:05.999
It is obvious that he will take
precautions not to ruin his reputation.

01:27:07.799 --> 01:27:09.099
He will cover this case.

01:27:10.366 --> 01:27:13.099
He will see me as an enemy
not our nomad groups.

01:27:14.633 --> 01:27:16.499
This is what you want, Bey.

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:23.733
He will ride for a fall as he set a trap
like Gumustekin.

01:27:29.733 --> 01:27:32.999
Bey, but I want you to know,
that Gundogdu Bey

01:27:33.399 --> 01:27:34.866
is not chief commander anymore.

01:27:37.033 --> 01:27:39.999
-What are you saying, Artuk Bey?
-His situation is not good, Bey.

01:27:41.066 --> 01:27:42.666
We have to do what has to be done

01:27:42.833 --> 01:27:44.799
in order to maintain the security
of our nomad groups.

01:27:45.566 --> 01:27:48.466
I would tell to Hayme Hatun
when the time comes

01:27:49.033 --> 01:27:50.699
but I want you to know it first.

01:27:52.833 --> 01:27:53.966
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

01:28:03.633 --> 01:28:06.833
Bey, you should know that
you are not alone.

01:28:07.933 --> 01:28:10.066
Thank you, Artuk Bey. Thank you.

01:28:14.133 --> 01:28:15.133
Let's begin, Bey.

01:28:42.999 --> 01:28:45.533
-Gundogdu!
-Sister, sister!

01:28:45.899 --> 01:28:50.466
Be calm, be patient.
This too shall pass, be patient.

01:29:03.399 --> 01:29:04.466
Come, sister.

01:30:20.099 --> 01:30:23.599
Gumustekin Bey, I promise you that

01:30:24.799 --> 01:30:26.899
I will take the revenge from the ones
who did this to you.

01:30:31.366 --> 01:30:32.666
Do not be worry yourself.

01:30:33.633 --> 01:30:37.466
I will not bring to light
this nomad group

01:30:39.066 --> 01:30:41.933
Ertugrul and and his beloved ones
until I get your revenge.

01:31:18.799 --> 01:31:20.799
Come here, Tugtekin Bey. What is wrong?

01:31:24.099 --> 01:31:26.566
Alps that went after Goncagul came back.

01:31:27.532 --> 01:31:28.733
They could not find her.

01:31:31.032 --> 01:31:34.066
There is no place to run,
of course they will find her.

01:31:34.899 --> 01:31:36.399
Alps will keep on searching.

01:31:37.966 --> 01:31:42.699
I will not be relieved while that woman
keeps breathing, Mother Hayme.

01:32:59.133 --> 01:33:00.133
What are you doing, Turgut?

01:33:08.133 --> 01:33:09.133
Welcome, Bey.

01:33:12.766 --> 01:33:16.366
Turali, will take his first step
being an Alp.

01:33:17.866 --> 01:33:18.999
He will be circumcised.

01:33:19.833 --> 01:33:22.833
An Alp should has his sword.

01:33:30.499 --> 01:33:34.066
If father Demir was here, he would
make the first sword of Turali.

01:33:35.633 --> 01:33:37.866
Now, it is my duty, Bey.

01:33:58.366 --> 01:33:59.399
<i>Wonderful!</i>

01:34:00.466 --> 01:34:01.966
<i>Azrael does not have mercy to his enemy.</i>

01:34:02.333 --> 01:34:04.366
<i>If God permits, in the hands of</i>
 <i>a brave man like you</i>

01:34:04.566 --> 01:34:07.666
<i>it may be the sound and rage of injustice.</i>

01:34:15.499 --> 01:34:18.733
He was upbringing the iron,
he was giving soul to the flame.

01:34:19.966 --> 01:34:22.099
The swords he made was
murdering non-Muslims.

01:34:25.399 --> 01:34:26.533
Oh big, Wild Demir!

01:34:31.333 --> 01:34:32.366
Very well then, Turgut.

01:34:33.466 --> 01:34:34.933
Let's see what Wild Demir tought to us.

01:34:35.566 --> 01:34:37.799
Thank you, Bey. Let's start then.

01:34:44.566 --> 01:34:45.566
Let's start.

01:34:55.733 --> 01:34:56.766
In the name of God!

01:34:57.966 --> 01:34:59.499
-God!
-Only one God!

01:35:00.066 --> 01:35:01.699
-God!
-Only one God!

01:35:02.133 --> 01:35:04.366
-God!
-Only one God!

01:35:04.666 --> 01:35:06.099
-God!
-Only one God!

01:35:06.633 --> 01:35:08.533
-God!
-Only one God!

01:35:08.966 --> 01:35:10.666
-God!
-Only one God!

01:35:10.933 --> 01:35:12.733
-God!
-Only one God!

01:35:13.066 --> 01:35:14.866
-God!
-Only one God!

01:35:15.766 --> 01:35:17.666
-God!
-Only one God!

01:36:33.433 --> 01:36:36.033
Big steel mountain where the sun
cannot wander.

01:36:37.699 --> 01:36:39.799
Moon cannot wander beneath.

01:36:41.333 --> 01:36:43.333
Axe cannot cut the great tree.

01:36:44.399 --> 01:36:46.366
Ayaz Khan with moon and sun.

01:36:47.666 --> 01:36:49.633
My moorland which is adorned with clothes.

01:36:50.533 --> 01:36:52.599
Leafed, blessed beech tree.

01:36:53.933 --> 01:36:56.366
Akyayik who is the owner of quick.

01:36:58.099 --> 01:37:00.433
Oh, Sky God!

01:37:01.866 --> 01:37:03.666
My waters kill thousand servants.

01:37:04.566 --> 01:37:06.066
Cloud eyed Bugra Khan.

01:37:07.533 --> 01:37:08.899
Ice footed Bey man.

01:37:11.433 --> 01:37:15.099
Cloud. Moon. Bugra.

01:37:23.799 --> 01:37:30.333
My these lands be our homeland which
we fought, wandered and spilled blood.

01:37:30.633 --> 01:37:31.866
Our homeland!

01:37:32.066 --> 01:37:36.333
My brave men who follow Genghis Khan!

01:37:36.999 --> 01:37:39.066
We came to these lands for revenge!

01:37:39.533 --> 01:37:41.933
For revenge!
-For revenge!

01:37:42.666 --> 01:37:43.766
For blood!

01:37:44.033 --> 01:37:47.766
For revenge! Happy revenge!

01:38:28.433 --> 01:38:29.999
Ameer Sadettin Kobek Almighty!

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:00.933
Welcome, poets.

01:39:03.733 --> 01:39:04.799
Come on, sit down.

01:39:13.066 --> 01:39:14.699
Goodness comes with you

01:39:15.366 --> 01:39:19.733
it is dispersed like desert winds
in the absence of you, Ameer Sadettin.

01:39:21.766 --> 01:39:23.433
You are an ocean

01:39:23.799 --> 01:39:29.366
with your politeness us poets became
a drop of water in the ocean.

01:39:31.333 --> 01:39:33.533
Why are you so angry, Ameer Almighty?

01:39:34.066 --> 01:39:38.866
Do your people renege and play a trick
for raising hell about you?

01:39:40.033 --> 01:39:44.033
We know that, they will get their share
from the sword of your justice.

01:39:44.533 --> 01:39:47.433
Your greatness is because of this.
-Justice?

01:39:49.766 --> 01:39:50.766
Justice!

01:39:55.833 --> 01:39:59.033
Justice is the thing that comes
with revenge.

01:40:00.699 --> 01:40:03.066
Justice is the shadow of revenge.

01:40:03.999 --> 01:40:05.899
Greatness is not about being dignitary

01:40:06.599 --> 01:40:08.633
it is not even living very close
with death.

01:40:08.933 --> 01:40:10.466
It is knowing how to win.

01:40:12.866 --> 01:40:15.899
If you qualify your revenge,
you can be great.

01:40:17.466 --> 01:40:18.499
Revenge!

01:40:19.766 --> 01:40:20.966
Revenge!

01:40:22.699 --> 01:40:24.533
Oh, revenge!

01:40:26.566 --> 01:40:27.833
Life!

01:40:31.999 --> 01:40:36.799
Revenge is as warm as the
breath of sweetest lover

01:40:38.133 --> 01:40:42.733
as innocent when your child
put his head to your shoulder.

01:40:43.433 --> 01:40:45.999
I have never heard such verses.

01:40:47.433 --> 01:40:49.533
Who is this great poet, Ameer Almighty?

01:40:51.866 --> 01:40:53.399
-It is me.
-Thank you.

01:40:53.599 --> 01:40:54.699
Thank you.

01:40:57.599 --> 01:40:59.633
Come on eat your meal.
Do not make it cold.

01:41:23.476 --> 01:41:26.343
Thank God, your fever is reduced Bey.

01:41:27.343 --> 01:41:29.143
You will be fine, if God permits.

01:41:29.976 --> 01:41:31.443
If God permits, Hatun.

01:41:34.643 --> 01:41:38.276
Gumustekin, what happened to him?

01:41:39.243 --> 01:41:43.310
Ertugrul Bey scattered his head
in the middle of nomad group.

01:41:44.376 --> 01:41:45.643
God bless!

01:41:48.043 --> 01:41:49.443
Gundogdu...

01:41:51.076 --> 01:41:53.210
...I want to tell you something.

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:57.010
I am pregnant!

01:41:58.210 --> 01:42:00.110
I will give a child.

01:42:09.243 --> 01:42:11.276
After all these pain...

01:42:12.243 --> 01:42:15.576
...I know this child who is vouchsafed
from God will grow up...

01:42:16.043 --> 01:42:18.710
...and be a brave man who behooves you.

01:42:19.376 --> 01:42:20.976
No, do not think like that.

01:42:21.243 --> 01:42:24.543
It will be a child
who behooves a mother like you.

01:42:52.576 --> 01:42:56.243
Brother, what are you thinking about?

01:42:58.610 --> 01:43:01.143
You do not have the remedy of my trouble,
brother!

01:43:01.610 --> 01:43:03.510
My trouble is about love...

01:43:04.076 --> 01:43:06.010
...not about beating a bear.

01:43:06.576 --> 01:43:11.343
Brother, do not brush me off brother,
I have knowledge.

01:43:11.943 --> 01:43:14.143
What are you saying brother?
What knowledge?

01:43:15.243 --> 01:43:19.343
Tell it brother, tell it.
Tell it to me brother.

01:43:23.476 --> 01:43:27.476
I will ask to Banu Cicek to be my wife.

01:43:28.443 --> 01:43:31.210
But I do not know how to say that.

01:43:32.143 --> 01:43:36.410
Brother, I thought you will found a state
and collapse a state.

01:43:37.443 --> 01:43:40.410
Look brother, you will say...

01:43:41.676 --> 01:43:48.176
..."This heart if mine, it burst into
flames, your expectancy glare down on me."

01:43:51.343 --> 01:43:53.176
I could not understand, what will I say?

01:43:53.610 --> 01:43:55.110
Which part did not you understand,
brother?

01:43:55.243 --> 01:43:57.143
I will say one last time...

01:43:59.443 --> 01:44:04.943
..."My heart burst into flames,
your expectancy glare down on me".

01:44:06.643 --> 01:44:08.110
It is good.

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:11.676
"This heart of mine,
it burst into flames...

01:44:12.243 --> 01:44:15.076
...your expectancy glare down on me".
It sounds good.

01:44:17.143 --> 01:44:18.543
What will I say more?

01:44:18.943 --> 01:44:20.543
And you will continue like this...

01:44:20.643 --> 01:44:26.410
..."Your glances pierced my heart
like an arrow...

01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:33.276
...your beauty is a well hole
and I am falling into it as Joseph.

01:44:35.076 --> 01:44:38.510
I am like a dry leaf in a lonely desert".

01:44:40.276 --> 01:44:42.643
How do you know these brother?

01:44:44.076 --> 01:44:46.576
It is knowledge brother, knowledge!

01:44:48.343 --> 01:44:50.310
You cannot query a man with knowledge!

01:44:50.643 --> 01:44:53.176
And like Geyikli brother said...

01:44:53.243 --> 01:44:54.576
..."Do not look at the one who tell...

01:44:55.176 --> 01:44:57.243
...look at the one who make you tell,
brother."

01:44:59.010 --> 01:45:01.076
You will look at the one
who make you tell.

01:45:04.676 --> 01:45:09.676
My heart burst into flames,
your expectancy...

01:45:26.343 --> 01:45:30.243
You will apply this cure to the wound
Banu Cicek Hatun.

01:45:31.176 --> 01:45:33.576
May God bless you, Artuk Bey.

01:45:42.476 --> 01:45:48.910
I have patients, do the things I said,
May God cure you.

01:46:03.610 --> 01:46:05.243
How is your wound, Cicek Hatun?

01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:06.976
Thank you Dogan Alp.

01:46:07.043 --> 01:46:11.643
It is fine, with the cure Artuk Bey gave,
it will get better if God permits.

01:46:12.343 --> 01:46:13.610
If God permits.

01:46:14.543 --> 01:46:16.710
If God permits, Cicek Hatun,
if God permits.

01:46:20.076 --> 01:46:21.110
Cicek Hatun...

01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:24.476
...your heart burnt me.

01:46:25.376 --> 01:46:27.243
What kind of eyes you have...

01:46:27.610 --> 01:46:29.510
They pierced my heart like an arrow.

01:46:30.943 --> 01:46:33.976
You are a well hole and I fell into it.

01:46:34.476 --> 01:46:37.710
You are a desert and I got lost in it.

01:46:38.476 --> 01:46:40.543
What are you saying Dogan Alp?

01:46:41.343 --> 01:46:43.176
I do not even know what I say.

01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:45.476
Really Bamsi!

01:46:47.010 --> 01:46:50.210
Well, with the help of God!

01:46:50.710 --> 01:46:53.143
I do not know words like these
Cicek Hatun.

01:46:55.643 --> 01:46:59.276
Banu Cicek, I want you to be my wife.

01:47:00.110 --> 01:47:02.110
I want you to accept me as your man.

01:47:10.076 --> 01:47:12.076
If you say so...

01:47:13.076 --> 01:47:18.676
...then I will be life to your life
and cure to your heart.

01:47:20.376 --> 01:47:23.443
From now on, your tent is my palace.

01:47:23.976 --> 01:47:25.676
Your life will be my heaven.

01:47:26.976 --> 01:47:31.210
Your trouble will be my food,
your joy will be my spring...

01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:34.476
...my life will be your life.

01:47:44.243 --> 01:47:45.643
Dogan Alp?

01:47:49.543 --> 01:47:51.176
Dogan Alp?

01:47:55.076 --> 01:47:56.510
Thank God!

01:48:00.010 --> 01:48:03.976
I... I could not understand.

01:48:06.143 --> 01:48:10.410
I asked you to be my wife
and you said yes, right?

01:48:10.576 --> 01:48:11.976
I said yes!

01:48:14.643 --> 01:48:18.010
I asked you to be my wife
and you said yes.

01:48:18.210 --> 01:48:20.576
-You said yes. So you will be my wife!
-Yes Dogan Alp.

01:48:23.176 --> 01:48:26.510
Then I should go and tell Bey
what happened.

01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:31.610
Ertugrul Bey may come and ask permission
for you from Tugtekin Bey.

01:48:32.210 --> 01:48:33.976
Alright.

01:48:43.643 --> 01:48:45.043
Did you say yes?

01:48:45.143 --> 01:48:46.443
I said yes!

01:48:48.043 --> 01:48:49.243
She said yes!

01:48:50.943 --> 01:48:53.076
<i>God!</i>

01:48:54.276 --> 01:48:56.510
<i>God!</i>

01:49:14.043 --> 01:49:15.543
Halime Sultan...

01:49:17.176 --> 01:49:18.410
...why did you get up?

01:49:18.643 --> 01:49:20.610
-I am fine.
-Artuk Bey said you should rest.

01:49:20.943 --> 01:49:24.243
I am fine Ertugrul Bey,
you do not need to worry.

01:49:25.676 --> 01:49:30.643
Our child keeps saying it is hungry and
it's kicks are severe.

01:49:32.410 --> 01:49:35.943
And I want to be with you
in a good day like this.

01:49:37.076 --> 01:49:38.610
Permission, Bey?

01:49:39.710 --> 01:49:41.043
Come in, Abdurrahman.

01:49:49.243 --> 01:49:51.410
Ertugrul Bey, Dogan Alp wants to see you.

01:49:51.943 --> 01:49:54.976
It is obvious that something happened.
He cannot fidget.

01:49:59.143 --> 01:50:00.276
Let him in.

01:50:16.076 --> 01:50:19.410
Bey, if you permit I have a wish.

01:50:20.243 --> 01:50:22.243
Tell it Dogan Alp, what happened to you?

01:50:23.943 --> 01:50:26.010
My remedy is you Bey.

01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:28.510
As you know, Banu Cicek and I!

01:50:29.476 --> 01:50:32.343
When should we ask for Banu Cicek Hatun
from Tugtekin Bey?

01:50:35.043 --> 01:50:37.110
Whenever you and Mother Hayme want.

01:50:37.276 --> 01:50:38.610
We are ready, Bey.

01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:40.643
Good.

01:50:41.243 --> 01:50:43.343
We will ask for her from Tugtekin Bey
tomorrow night...

01:50:43.643 --> 01:50:45.976
...and we will enter the spring
with the union of two lovers.

01:50:49.210 --> 01:50:50.976
God may bless you Bey!

01:51:29.410 --> 01:51:30.643
Lam Aleph.

01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:43.910
Thank God, our nomad group
is cleaned from betrayers.

01:51:44.643 --> 01:51:47.310
From now on, everything will be fine.

01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:49.643
Right Turali?

01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:52.076
You are right Turgut Alp.

01:51:52.276 --> 01:51:55.243
Artuk Bey will circumcise me
in the earliest time...

01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:58.076
-...and he will give me my first sword.
-If God permits.

01:51:58.176 --> 01:52:03.476
Look at my Turali Alp! He is a lion!
Praise be! Praise be!

01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:09.376
Brothers, peace is something beautiful!

01:52:09.643 --> 01:52:14.410
From now on, I will continue
to my education more.

01:52:18.643 --> 01:52:24.976
Alright Bamsi, tell us, don't you have
advices to us?

01:52:26.910 --> 01:52:29.310
We want to take advantage of
your knowledge.

01:52:30.043 --> 01:52:31.176
Brother...

01:52:31.543 --> 01:52:35.143
... the thing what behooves a wise person
is not advising by...

01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:39.276
...telling but by experience.

01:52:43.210 --> 01:52:44.476
Thank you.

01:52:47.676 --> 01:52:52.410
Bamsi Alp articulated us
poor dervishes' feelings.

01:52:53.943 --> 01:52:57.910
Brother, intimidating the truth is hard...

01:52:58.910 --> 01:53:03.176
...the one who seeks the truth is
sallow...

01:53:04.276 --> 01:53:09.243
...for the wise person,
enjoyment is less and suffering is more.

01:53:11.976 --> 01:53:16.043
Oh God, so that is the reason why you are
as thin as a rake.

01:53:17.276 --> 01:53:18.676
So that is why.

01:53:21.043 --> 01:53:22.576
Do you think like that?

01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:27.276
This education life made me feel hungry.

01:53:27.976 --> 01:53:31.610
I need to eat. Is there any lamb?

01:53:39.110 --> 01:53:43.943
There is brother, do not worry.
I will cut a big lamb for you.

01:53:44.010 --> 01:53:46.176
Cut it brother, cut.

01:53:46.343 --> 01:53:49.010
Cut a lamb, cut a ram.

01:53:51.543 --> 01:53:54.543
Why do you want to learn knowledge,
Bamsi Alp?

01:53:56.376 --> 01:53:57.443
Brother...

01:53:58.643 --> 01:54:00.910
...God address comments to us.

01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:03.576
He gave us Koran.

01:54:04.343 --> 01:54:08.610
Now, if I do not read it,
I would be ungrateful.

01:54:09.210 --> 01:54:10.443
Alright!

01:54:12.576 --> 01:54:14.343
Thank you, brother!

01:54:15.010 --> 01:54:16.976
God!

01:54:17.476 --> 01:54:18.476
What happened Dogan?

01:54:18.543 --> 01:54:20.710
Banu Cicek accepted
to be my wife, brothers.

01:54:21.443 --> 01:54:25.043
Tomorrow, mother Hayme and Ertugrul Bey
will ask for her from Tugtekin Bey.

01:54:26.076 --> 01:54:32.343
Oh! My lad! My ram! Praise be!

01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:33.910
Good luck with it!

01:54:36.943 --> 01:54:38.676
Come here brother!

01:54:44.343 --> 01:54:46.343
Come here!

01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:50.276
<i>In the name of God.</i>

01:54:54.443 --> 01:54:55.910
Peace be upon you.

01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:58.443
And peace be upon you brother,
come in brother!

01:54:58.676 --> 01:55:01.210
No brother, no. Come in.

01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:05.243
They said one cannot heal
without eating my mother's meal.

01:55:05.376 --> 01:55:07.576
Brother Sungur knows this well.
So we came here.

01:55:07.943 --> 01:55:10.676
-Welcome!
-Come in, son. Welcome.

01:55:14.410 --> 01:55:15.610
Welcome daughter.

01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:18.043
-Thank you, mother.
-Come here, sister in law.

01:55:18.176 --> 01:55:20.210
-Thank you.
-Take a seat, Sungur.

01:55:23.576 --> 01:55:25.210
Here we go.

01:55:28.110 --> 01:55:30.443
-Take it brother.
-Thank you brother.

01:55:31.476 --> 01:55:32.610
Mother.

01:55:32.976 --> 01:55:34.476
Thank you son.

01:55:37.110 --> 01:55:39.443
Come on! In the name of God.

01:55:52.343 --> 01:55:54.176
Permission, Mother Hayme?

01:55:54.710 --> 01:55:56.410
Come in, Abdurrahman.

01:55:59.976 --> 01:56:03.710
Mother Hayme, a messenger brought
news about Dundar Bey and Yigit Alp.

01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:07.110
If God permits, they will be here
in few days.

01:56:15.143 --> 01:56:16.910
Thank God!

01:56:22.343 --> 01:56:25.276
God, thank God.

01:56:26.210 --> 01:56:28.543
I will be able to sit down to same meal
with my children!

01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:33.210
In migration time, knowing that
my children will be with me...

01:56:33.676 --> 01:56:35.510
...then now,
I will not afraid of anything.

01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:40.910
The indefinite that dried our blood in
our veins is over!

01:56:41.343 --> 01:56:44.276
If God permits, spring may bring us
peace and justice.

01:56:44.476 --> 01:56:46.310
-If God permits!
-If God permits!

01:56:47.310 --> 01:56:49.310
Come on, eat.

01:57:17.343 --> 01:57:18.443
Bey...

01:57:21.310 --> 01:57:24.043
...I do not want any secrets
between us no more.

01:57:26.643 --> 01:57:30.310
All the secrets make bleed our
etched wounds.

01:57:39.243 --> 01:57:41.143
Do you have another secret Gokce?

01:57:46.210 --> 01:57:48.410
There was a man of Kurdoglu.

01:57:51.243 --> 01:57:54.010
He spread terror to the nomad group
like Gumustekin.

01:57:56.210 --> 01:57:58.343
Ertugrul Bey was seriously wounded.

01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:03.276
That man came to kill him when he was
dying.

01:58:09.243 --> 01:58:11.343
I was there...

01:58:15.443 --> 01:58:18.476
...and I tried to protect Ertugrul Bey...

01:58:29.043 --> 01:58:31.376
But he wounded me seriously
with his dagger.

01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:38.543
I am afraid that that wound...

01:58:43.076 --> 01:58:45.976
...may have took my womanhood from me,
Bey.

01:58:50.110 --> 01:58:52.443
I am afraid of not giving you a child.

01:59:30.576 --> 01:59:33.643
Almighty Ameer, Merchant Abdullah
came from Tabriz.

01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:35.510
He has important news.

01:59:35.943 --> 01:59:37.276
Merchant Abdullah?

01:59:44.643 --> 01:59:46.243
Take him inside.

01:59:46.476 --> 01:59:48.043
But search him properly.

01:59:48.676 --> 01:59:51.210
Do not let him take anything as a weapon.
Come on.

01:59:51.443 --> 01:59:53.176
As you please, Ameer Almighty.

02:00:38.443 --> 02:00:40.676
You do not need that much precaution,
Sadettin.

02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:47.510
I threw the things you did to me
in the past to the water of Amu Darya.

02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:53.643
I heard that Ogeday drum you out of
his army.

02:00:56.010 --> 02:00:59.276
And besides, he put a prize on your head.

02:01:01.443 --> 02:01:04.976
And I heard that
Ertugrul cut the dog's head...

02:01:05.576 --> 02:01:08.043
...that you trust and ruined
your reputation.

02:01:11.476 --> 02:01:13.176
What do you want?

02:01:13.576 --> 02:01:15.176
I want Ertugrul.

02:01:16.043 --> 02:01:17.976
Just as you do.

02:02:09.276 --> 02:02:11.710
Do not you afraid that I may kill you?

02:02:15.243 --> 02:02:21.143
Sadettin! I have all the letters
that you wrote me.

02:02:22.376 --> 02:02:25.943
What would happen if your
Sultan sees them?

02:02:30.276 --> 02:02:33.676
-What do you want?
-I told you, I want Ertugrul.

02:02:34.543 --> 02:02:36.276
So you will do it alone?

02:02:36.576 --> 02:02:38.210
I am not alone Sadettin.

02:02:39.110 --> 02:02:42.910
I heard, you are wondering
with some looters....

02:02:42.976 --> 02:02:44.910
...that Ogeday drum them out of the army.

02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:52.043
They are the most pitiless killers
of Mongol army and there are you...

02:02:53.043 --> 02:02:55.110
...I trust you the most.

02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:03.376
Tell me, what is in your mind?

02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:06.610
Let me tell.

02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:14.110
My men want pillage, prize
they are seeking for gold...

02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:18.610
...and you do not want to disquiet
in these lands.

02:03:21.076 --> 02:03:25.210
Neither you do not want my men
to attack...

02:03:26.110 --> 02:03:29.276
...the nomad groups for prize nor
a rebellion of...

02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:32.543
...Kayi and Dodurga tribes because of the
soldier that you sent for Ertugrul.

02:03:34.343 --> 02:03:36.376
Both of us want Erturgul.

02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:39.910
I will take his head to you.

02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:41.543
How?

02:03:43.410 --> 02:03:46.376
I want to finish my unfinished business
with Ertugrul...

02:03:47.710 --> 02:03:49.476
...Ameer Almighty.

02:03:50.910 --> 02:03:53.010
Of course with your help.

02:04:29.043 --> 02:04:35.076
Tell your soldiers to fight not for gold
but for the blood of Ertugrul.

02:04:36.076 --> 02:04:38.176
I will always make them satisfied...

02:04:39.176 --> 02:04:41.576
...as long as you bring
the head of Ertugrul to me.

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:48.276
My duty is to disconnect the road between
two nomad groups...

02:04:48.343 --> 02:04:49.676
...which is connected because of you.

02:04:50.610 --> 02:04:53.543
I will flop down on them like a nightmare.

02:04:54.076 --> 02:04:57.076
Every other day that they live will be
torture for them.

02:05:02.376 --> 02:05:03.410
Ameer Almighty!

02:05:03.643 --> 02:05:05.976
-What happened?
-There is a woman that wants to see you.

02:05:09.310 --> 02:05:11.643
-Who is she?
-She says that her name is Goncagul...

02:05:11.710 --> 02:05:13.143
...Ameer Almighty.

02:05:13.643 --> 02:05:16.043
Good, she can wait.

02:05:19.376 --> 02:05:21.710
You should have something to talk.

02:05:23.543 --> 02:05:29.676
If you are right, I will a give you
more valuable present than gold, Noyan.

02:05:33.076 --> 02:05:34.310
Wait there.

02:05:47.076 --> 02:05:48.676
Take her in.

02:05:59.276 --> 02:06:01.043
Are you alright, daughter?

02:06:13.243 --> 02:06:17.543
I want to take the revenge of my aunt
and my father, Ameer Almighty.

02:06:19.210 --> 02:06:21.676
I do not have anybody but you.

02:06:23.643 --> 02:06:27.376
I am subservient to you until I die.

02:06:29.376 --> 02:06:30.576
Daughter!

02:06:31.943 --> 02:06:33.643
Come here child.

02:07:18.076 --> 02:07:21.943
Sadettin Kobek will pester us more.

02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:25.143
So I think that we should proceed
our union...

02:07:25.243 --> 02:07:27.476
...with Dodurga tribe until the
next spring.

02:07:27.976 --> 02:07:29.943
This will make us more powerful.

02:07:30.243 --> 02:07:31.910
We can enlarge our flocks.

02:07:32.010 --> 02:07:36.010
Selcan Hatun and Halime Hatun can show
their abilities. We can sell our rugs.

02:07:37.243 --> 02:07:40.443
There are brave men at the age of Alp,
we can train them.

02:07:40.610 --> 02:07:42.643
And in the spring, we can migrate.

02:07:42.910 --> 02:07:46.510
I think we should council it
in headquarters.

02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:05.143
Mother.

02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:11.143
Do you think about a place
when the migration time comes?

02:08:14.110 --> 02:08:15.176
No son.

02:08:15.543 --> 02:08:22.010
But I want to council this matter
with my Beys in the earliest time.

02:08:24.110 --> 02:08:25.410
Thank you!

02:08:26.376 --> 02:08:29.710
Brother Ertugrul, do you have a place
in your mind?

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:41.910
I want to go to the lands where
the roots of Kayi tribe will take...

02:08:41.976 --> 02:08:43.176
...with the ones who sit at that table.

02:08:43.310 --> 02:08:47.443
To the lands where our sons and
daughters can pray after we die...

02:08:47.576 --> 02:08:49.976
...and the place that they can dig
a grave.

02:08:50.076 --> 02:08:52.943
If god permits, we can decide together.

02:08:53.276 --> 02:08:54.376
If God permits.

02:08:55.076 --> 02:08:58.043
Well said brother, if God permits.

02:09:03.976 --> 02:09:05.210
Mother Hayme,...

02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:08.510
...if you permit, I want to say something
to you.

02:09:08.643 --> 02:09:10.210
Tell it, daughter.

02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:15.176
I don't know when or where our nomad group
will migrate.

02:09:15.243 --> 02:09:18.610
But I want to hold on tight to that lands.

02:09:18.943 --> 02:09:25.576
Thus Halime and I can raise
our babies in our own homeland.

02:09:26.643 --> 02:09:28.076
Oh my God!

02:09:32.710 --> 02:09:34.276
I am pregnant mother!

02:09:40.410 --> 02:09:43.910
If God permits,
I will give birth to a child this time.

02:09:45.243 --> 02:09:46.310
My son!

02:09:58.310 --> 02:10:00.376
Thank God!

02:10:01.343 --> 02:10:06.343
You destined me to be together
with all my children before I die.

02:10:19.010 --> 02:10:20.543
Children...

02:10:21.043 --> 02:10:23.710
...your burden is heavy,
our job is difficult and our strength...

02:10:24.110 --> 02:10:26.443
...is linked to a slender bristle.

02:10:26.710 --> 02:10:29.076
May Almighty God help us!

02:10:29.376 --> 02:10:30.443
-Amen!
-Amen!

02:10:30.643 --> 02:10:33.010
May our seignory be constant.

02:10:33.643 --> 02:10:36.210
May our seignory be beneficial
in the way of God.

02:10:36.543 --> 02:10:39.343
-Amen.
-May the light of Kayi tribe shine.

02:10:40.510 --> 02:10:45.343
Thus it can brighten the ones
that are in darkness.

02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:52.910
Prevent our strength, our power,
our mind our words away from home.

02:10:54.043 --> 02:10:57.943
May prevent us from the malignancy of
encroaching.

02:10:58.176 --> 02:11:01.276
And may God not separate us
from our religion and morals.

02:11:01.343 --> 02:11:02.376
Amen.

02:11:02.910 --> 02:11:06.010
May God not forget us from where
we came and where we go.

02:11:06.143 --> 02:11:07.410
-Amen.
-Amen.

02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:11.510
May God not sheer us from our
Ancestor Oghuz.

02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:14.343
-Amen.
-Amen.

02:11:16.043 --> 02:11:19.476
May God not separate us!

02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:22.943
Make us one, make us together...

02:11:23.243 --> 02:11:26.310
...make us big, make us alive!

02:11:27.276 --> 02:11:32.276
God, connect us each other with love and
respect.

02:11:32.476 --> 02:11:33.543
Amen.
