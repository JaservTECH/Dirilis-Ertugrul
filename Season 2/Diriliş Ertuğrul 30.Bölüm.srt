Episode 30 will start after 12:03 min

12:03.890 --> 12:07.890
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:09.027 --> 12:12.693
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:13.377 --> 12:16.544
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:18.917 --> 12:20.484
I brought your Alps, brave man.

12:26.117 --> 12:27.784
With the name of God.

12:28.817 --> 12:30.950
God, save us from evil jinn.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.550
I told you Geyikli is wicked.

12:35.284 --> 12:38.150
Did not you recognize your Bey?

12:41.350 --> 12:42.350
Ertugrul Bey?

12:47.817 --> 12:48.917
Is this really you?

12:49.550 --> 12:50.817
Poke him.

12:53.150 --> 12:54.150
Not me!

12:58.250 --> 13:00.950
Bey, this is you.
-Yes, this is me.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.784
Our Bey is alive!

13:07.017 --> 13:08.884
Bey is alive! He is alive!

13:09.317 --> 13:10.384
Bey is alive!

13:14.950 --> 13:16.317
Turgut! Dogan!

13:17.150 --> 13:19.784
-Bey, thank God, you are alive!
-Thank God!

13:25.084 --> 13:27.150
Bey! Bey! Bey!

13:28.984 --> 13:30.384
Easy! Easy!

13:31.217 --> 13:32.784
You will make my Bey regret he is alive.

13:36.484 --> 13:37.817
-Bey!
-My lions!

13:38.184 --> 13:39.184
Bey!

13:43.184 --> 13:45.184
Bey, thank God, you are alive!

13:50.550 --> 13:51.550
Bey!

14:07.917 --> 14:10.850
I will make you pay for
what you did to me, Gundogdu.

14:12.450 --> 14:14.350
If we kill him, Noyan may forgive us.

14:16.084 --> 14:17.817
-Us?
-Yes.

14:19.784 --> 14:21.017
You are the one who failed, Borklu.

14:22.317 --> 14:24.584
Noyan will kill all the men
because of your awkwardness.

14:51.317 --> 14:56.017
The long and the short of it, Tugtekin
is commander of two nomad tents' Alps.

14:59.884 --> 15:04.950
Hamza could not stand to
Tugtekin's slanders and left.

15:16.384 --> 15:22.117
I am talking about an army which is
vandalizing from Russia to Persian towns.

15:25.950 --> 15:30.050
A wild herd that will make us
hanker for Crusader Army.

15:35.884 --> 15:37.284
My brother and my mother
gave the right decision.

15:40.450 --> 15:41.584
There was no other way.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.350
We must be united.

15:49.417 --> 15:52.917
About other problem, it is a mistake
that you are exiled.

15:55.317 --> 15:58.850
Tugtekin is young, he made a mistake.

16:01.850 --> 16:02.850
We will do what is necessary.

16:10.884 --> 16:13.584
So, you talked about everyone.

16:17.350 --> 16:18.517
How is Aykiz sister?

16:26.050 --> 16:27.050
Aykiz...

16:32.317 --> 16:33.317
Aykiz...

16:34.917 --> 16:35.984
...fell martyr.

16:40.217 --> 16:41.384
They burned her alive...

16:45.184 --> 16:46.384
...while she was fighting.

18:59.870 --> 19:00.970
Seven Iron?

19:01.937 --> 19:04.037
He dug Aykiz's grave by his own hands.

19:05.837 --> 19:07.703
He only had Aykiz in this world.

19:08.537 --> 19:10.003
And she has gone to another world.

19:10.337 --> 19:13.937
His look, his talk and everything
he does have changed.

20:32.237 --> 20:33.637
You prolonged my life, brother.

20:34.803 --> 20:36.270
May God bless you.

20:37.837 --> 20:38.837
Thank you, Bey.

21:23.903 --> 21:26.370
From now on, Halime will stay
in my marquee.

21:26.837 --> 21:28.803
Also, Gokce will sleep in my marquee.

21:30.803 --> 21:31.970
As you wish, mother.

21:35.303 --> 21:37.270
Are you worried for her baby, mother?

21:39.603 --> 21:42.037
Do not worry,
I have eyes only for her, too.

21:42.770 --> 21:45.737
Gokce and Halime, they are both my sister.

21:46.803 --> 21:48.470
Her child is my child.

21:49.903 --> 21:53.403
I will not let anything bad happen
to her and her baby.

21:57.037 --> 21:59.537
It is a miracle that her baby
is still alive.

22:08.603 --> 22:09.737
Come on, my daughter.

22:11.670 --> 22:13.237
You shall go to your work.

23:04.337 --> 23:07.937
They slaughtered even women and children.

23:10.003 --> 23:15.303
They thought our women
would have been afraid and surrender.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.970
Our women fought like Alps.

23:23.670 --> 23:24.770
Bey.

23:25.937 --> 23:28.337
Know that, if we do not make those
inglorious bastards pay for it

23:30.970 --> 23:32.637
I will be ashamed of being a man.

23:36.770 --> 23:38.003
Turgut Alp

23:39.637 --> 23:41.670
we cannot drink or eat anything

23:42.770 --> 23:45.237
until we make them
pay for bloodshed they did.

23:52.237 --> 23:53.637
What happened to Kayi

23:54.837 --> 23:56.870
will happen to all Turkmen tribes.

23:59.037 --> 24:01.237
If we do not stop these tyrants

24:02.770 --> 24:04.237
we will lose Anatolia.

24:05.837 --> 24:09.703
How will we fight back to Mongols
who brought all world to their knees?

24:10.703 --> 24:16.670
All the world groans bitterly
by the tyranny of Mongols and Crusaders.

24:18.303 --> 24:20.370
If we are afraid of those tyrants

24:21.470 --> 24:23.037
if we do not stop them

24:24.303 --> 24:25.937
what shall oppressed people do?

24:27.670 --> 24:31.470
If we do not stop tyranny,
we will not be Alps, Bey.

24:45.970 --> 24:48.570
We could only be Turk,
if we do not knuckle under tyranny.

24:50.503 --> 24:52.470
We could only be Turk
if we fight infidels.

24:54.670 --> 24:57.003
We could be Turk if we are
a hope to the oppressed.

24:58.837 --> 25:00.370
What are you thinking of, Bey?

25:02.003 --> 25:05.837
We will fight until we perish,
until we die.

25:32.803 --> 25:33.803
Gundogdu Bey!

25:35.437 --> 25:37.570
Calm down Selcan, I am fine.

25:39.570 --> 25:42.037
How could you say that, Bey?
You are wounded.

25:43.270 --> 25:47.470
Mongols attacked him near the plain.
Now he is fine, Selcan Hatun.

25:48.637 --> 25:51.870
If Kocabash had not been there,
you would be mourning for me now, Hatun.

25:52.937 --> 25:54.970
From now on, he is my brother.

25:55.737 --> 25:56.737
Know that.

26:36.403 --> 26:39.237
Do you know why you are not
speared to these logs, Tankut?

26:42.703 --> 26:45.503
It is not the things a man has
that makes him weak

26:46.937 --> 26:49.803
but the things he wishes for.

26:51.337 --> 26:57.037
You must learn to not give up
and sleep as Ertugrul does.

26:58.370 --> 27:00.503
It was not possible to pass
all guards and escape.

27:00.770 --> 27:01.970
But he escaped.

27:25.537 --> 27:27.970
If you sleep or doze off

27:30.470 --> 27:34.370
the fork will pierce
both your chin and chest.

27:36.670 --> 27:40.503
If you survive you will regain my trust.

27:41.803 --> 27:44.670
It will not be easy to catch him again.

27:47.803 --> 27:50.537
-We will attract his attention.
-How?

27:53.270 --> 27:55.570
I have a very powerful tool to do this.

29:02.970 --> 29:04.470
I am grateful to you, brother.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.037
You took my nomad tent under your wing.

29:07.503 --> 29:09.503
You re-erected my husband's marquee.

29:10.270 --> 29:11.537
May God bless you.

29:13.537 --> 29:16.303
If God permits, both nomad tents
will grow together.

29:16.670 --> 29:17.870
If God permits.

29:18.803 --> 29:20.437
If God permits, that would happen.

29:21.403 --> 29:26.537
But Mongols coming near our nomad tent

29:27.670 --> 29:29.437
trying to kill my nephew

29:31.303 --> 29:32.503
is not acceptable.

29:40.937 --> 29:42.270
Is it, Tugtekin?

29:46.937 --> 29:48.303
Uncle...

29:50.237 --> 29:54.370
...if jackals attack the nest
the wolves, of course, lay an ambush.

29:55.603 --> 29:56.770
Do not worry.

29:57.470 --> 30:01.703
From now on, neither Dodurga
nor Kayi Alps will sleep.

30:04.903 --> 30:08.803
I gave orders to Alps, father.
I punished the faulty ones.

30:09.870 --> 30:12.570
From now on, we will keep a sharp lookout
in the nomad tent. Do not worry.

30:15.337 --> 30:17.237
Mistakes are made once, son.

30:18.637 --> 30:20.337
Repetition is foolish.

30:26.837 --> 30:29.370
We have no right to be foolish, uncle.

30:30.237 --> 30:33.937
I mean, going after head scarfed
was my fault.

30:37.037 --> 30:40.603
A momentary inattention
can cost our lives.

30:43.970 --> 30:47.503
Dodurga and Kayi Alps and
your nomad tents will be of

30:47.670 --> 30:49.937
one heart under Tugtekin's command.

30:56.970 --> 31:00.737
After late Ertugrul's unskillful Alps left

31:01.403 --> 31:04.037
there is no one left in nomad tent
who has bad intentions.

31:11.237 --> 31:12.737
They did not leave, Aytolun.

31:14.937 --> 31:17.670
They will come back to their nomad tent
when they are done being a guest.

31:21.537 --> 31:23.270
Moreover, they are my sons.

31:24.537 --> 31:26.370
I raised all of them.

31:26.970 --> 31:30.937
I have no pity on them
for my nomad tent's unity

31:31.803 --> 31:34.703
but it does not mean I give up on them.

31:37.237 --> 31:39.803
All the Alps are our sons, Mother Hayme.

31:40.537 --> 31:43.237
But yours is not being a guest.

31:46.603 --> 31:49.303
Oghuz tribes are welcomed
in each other's tribe.

31:54.337 --> 31:56.803
Some of us treat our Alps
like they are step-children.

32:05.803 --> 32:11.370
You and Gokce are step-children
of Mother Hayme, Selcan Hatun.

32:12.903 --> 32:16.970
But she treats you like her own children.

32:19.270 --> 32:23.303
Moreover, she married you
with her own son.

32:23.670 --> 32:25.537
She loves you more than her daughter.

32:26.270 --> 32:30.670
Know that, Kayi Alps are our own son, too.

32:31.870 --> 32:33.303
Give me bread.

32:40.570 --> 32:42.637
We need to learn Noyan's intention.

32:43.803 --> 32:47.303
If we do not know what he is planning

32:47.870 --> 32:49.870
he will cause us trouble sooner or later.

32:50.037 --> 32:53.570
According to news coming from Konya,
Sultan Alaeddin was gathering an army.

32:54.837 --> 32:58.870
Sultan Alaeddin's army cannot be here
before winter ends.

33:00.037 --> 33:01.703
So we need to be cautious.

33:02.370 --> 33:04.237
We need to prepare winter storage.

33:04.770 --> 33:08.303
Mongol fear captured every soul
even before they fought with them.

33:09.003 --> 33:11.903
That is why we need to keep
our eyes peeled.

33:13.270 --> 33:14.670
We should not hasten.

33:16.303 --> 33:18.003
What happens if we crack down on Noyan?

33:19.370 --> 33:20.837
If we crack down on Noyan

33:21.537 --> 33:24.237
we will be miserable
even in the very first battle.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.037
Our mothers, daughters

33:28.903 --> 33:32.003
and sisters will be miserable
in infidels' hands.

33:33.337 --> 33:35.303
They will also destroy the nomad tents.

33:39.270 --> 33:41.570
That is why, we will act smart.

33:42.570 --> 33:44.903
We will wait for Sultan Alaeddin's armies.

34:02.503 --> 34:07.403
When the enemy comes and takes his child

34:08.270 --> 34:10.037
whom a man cannot take his eyes off

34:11.703 --> 34:15.903
the spirit and the body he carries
will be a burden.

34:17.937 --> 34:21.803
If God permits,
May god meet you in paradise.

34:22.803 --> 34:23.903
Amen.

34:24.803 --> 34:27.403
It condoles me that Aykiz is a martyr.

34:28.470 --> 34:29.703
I always tell

34:30.237 --> 34:34.870
I wish I had a thousand sons
and all of them would be martyr.

34:36.803 --> 34:39.370
When are we going to
defeat Mongols, Wild Demir?

34:39.970 --> 34:44.337
It is allowed to Oghuz to
get out of this in one piece?

34:45.570 --> 34:50.270
We have an enemy worse
than Mongols, Artuk Bey.

34:50.937 --> 34:54.237
-Who is that enemy, Wild Demir?
-The instigation among us.

34:56.270 --> 34:59.737
Instigation and its fire.

35:00.737 --> 35:02.370
It burns me out, Artuk Bey.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.837
I also see that fire, Wild Demir.

35:09.303 --> 35:10.470
I also see it.

35:11.370 --> 35:12.837
But I cannot talk about it.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.370
If we do not put out the fire

35:17.603 --> 35:19.270
it will burn us all one day.

35:20.870 --> 35:22.803
Artuk Bey, Halime Sultan!

35:33.870 --> 35:34.937
We are here.

35:35.270 --> 35:38.837
Noyan's army is at beginning of precipice
where Pasinler plain ends.

35:39.870 --> 35:43.970
His other soldiers from Georgia to Kars,
from Kars to Ahlat

35:45.503 --> 35:49.837
as two large springs are waiting for the
war to be made with Sultan Alaeddin.

35:51.437 --> 35:54.437
Why are they waiting, Bey?
If they are so strong

35:55.003 --> 35:56.737
why would not they finish us already?

35:57.770 --> 36:02.437
Ogeday attacked China with the
largest army the world ever seen.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.403
They are fighting in China
with all their powers.

36:06.970 --> 36:08.537
They do not want to open another front.

36:08.837 --> 36:12.337
So after Ogeday ruins China
he will come for us.

36:14.470 --> 36:17.503
Break out! A big storm will break out!

36:17.903 --> 36:21.337
Rivers will babble blood,
the mountains will bleed

36:22.237 --> 36:24.603
there will be blood on roads, blood.

36:30.703 --> 36:34.537
Even if they move mountains
and make dungeons in it

36:35.603 --> 36:37.803
they shall not stop the light
of God, Geyikli.

36:39.470 --> 36:40.637
Be at ease.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.970
What are you thinking, Bey?

36:47.903 --> 36:49.703
We would be hard on their trail in winter.

36:51.270 --> 36:53.603
Noyan's wretched face
must not see the springs.

36:55.303 --> 36:57.570
We would finish them off
before their soldiers help.

36:58.270 --> 37:00.603
Bey, what about your brother, Sungurtekin?

37:02.403 --> 37:03.970
What if what Noyan said is true?

37:05.470 --> 37:07.003
What if he is at service of Ogeday?

37:09.237 --> 37:10.903
These is a secret among us for now.

37:12.337 --> 37:13.770
When we go back to nomad tent

37:14.970 --> 37:19.237
I do not want my brother and my mother
to be sorry because of this news.

37:21.570 --> 37:22.703
Is it understood?

37:23.403 --> 37:24.637
It is understood.

37:28.937 --> 37:30.537
What if what they said is true?

37:32.703 --> 37:34.037
If what they said is true

37:35.903 --> 37:39.737
if my brother knuckled under Ogeday

37:42.270 --> 37:43.670
I will break his neck

37:45.270 --> 37:47.037
otherwise my father shall not
find peace in his grave.

38:04.570 --> 38:05.603
Ertugrul.

38:10.003 --> 38:11.237
Ertugrul.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.003
Bring water from the cold well.

38:28.803 --> 38:30.670
We must bring down her fever.

38:57.503 --> 38:58.870
What is the situation, Artuk?

38:59.603 --> 39:01.403
I did my best, Hayme Hatun.

39:04.037 --> 39:05.803
We will lose either the baby...

39:07.637 --> 39:08.837
...or both.

39:36.503 --> 39:37.937
All I wanted was peace.

39:47.937 --> 39:49.037
God.

39:50.470 --> 39:53.303
God, get us out of this trouble.

39:55.270 --> 39:56.970
God, give us peace.

40:03.370 --> 40:07.037
First, Sungurtekin was gone.

40:10.337 --> 40:13.837
Then my husband, my man...

40:15.837 --> 40:18.003
...my Suleyman was gone to the next world.

40:21.537 --> 40:25.470
I bid farewell to my heart, Ertugrul.

40:36.837 --> 40:38.270
From now on...

40:41.003 --> 40:44.270
...my only hope is not to lose
my grandchild.

40:47.803 --> 40:49.403
If I lose him...

41:13.903 --> 41:16.570
Bey, you made your way out
of the that hell.

41:16.937 --> 41:18.370
Death will not come to you, Bey.

41:20.337 --> 41:24.703
Well, as I said, a man dies
when his time is right.

41:27.870 --> 41:29.537
So, the time was not right for me.

41:38.870 --> 41:41.970
Deer milk will heal your wounds.

41:46.937 --> 41:49.537
Thank you, Geyikli. You saved my life.

41:50.737 --> 41:51.970
I owe you a life.

41:52.637 --> 41:57.037
He is the one who does it,
who sees, who makes us see

41:58.470 --> 42:01.403
who makes things be,
who makes things die.

42:03.937 --> 42:05.670
We are human beings, brave man.

42:09.970 --> 42:12.837
Very nice, I will come back soon.

42:18.303 --> 42:19.470
Good bye, Alps.

43:05.270 --> 43:07.570
I heard that Kayi women are dexterous.

43:09.537 --> 43:12.403
Now I can see it on your beautiful hands.

43:17.437 --> 43:22.037
But seeing you worried
makes me sad, Gokce.

43:23.903 --> 43:28.037
After all this pain, even living
becomes a burden, Aytolun Hatun.

43:31.837 --> 43:33.303
You are my relative.

43:34.470 --> 43:37.303
I cannot let you wear yourself
down to a shadow.

43:39.537 --> 43:41.370
You are young and beautiful.

43:41.703 --> 43:44.270
No man can take their eyes off you.

43:45.370 --> 43:49.270
Because you are Suleyman Shah's daughter
no one draws near to you.

43:51.270 --> 43:52.703
Do not wear yourself down to a shadow.

43:55.803 --> 43:59.537
Tugtekin and Gundogdu
will go to Erzurum soon.

44:00.770 --> 44:01.937
Go with them.

44:02.370 --> 44:05.003
Go shopping, see new people.

44:06.003 --> 44:07.703
Buy delightful clothes for yourself.

44:12.537 --> 44:13.603
All right?

44:18.937 --> 44:24.803
Word is that, even Byzantine women
wear our chintz and textile fabric.

44:26.437 --> 44:31.603
Camel trains come to Konya
and Erzurum for trade.

44:33.537 --> 44:35.770
We are no less than Byzantine women.

44:37.403 --> 44:38.503
All right?

45:00.903 --> 45:03.037
Tugtekin Bey wants to see
the mitts, Aytolun Hatun.

45:05.270 --> 45:07.270
All right, leave. Gokce will bring them.

45:12.303 --> 45:17.470
Come on, show these mitts to Tugtekin.

45:19.037 --> 45:20.037
All right.

45:33.437 --> 45:36.437
I told you, that woman is dangerous
and stay away from her.

45:37.003 --> 45:38.603
Why do you not listen to me?

45:39.870 --> 45:42.837
I have never seen a woman
who is more dangerous than you, sister.

45:43.870 --> 45:48.337
But if she is as you said,
I got used to it because of you.

45:48.903 --> 45:52.503
Do not worry, I will be on the safe side.
Mind your own business.

47:46.903 --> 47:50.303
Bey, you wanted to see the mitts I made.

47:58.970 --> 47:59.970
Thank you.

48:01.037 --> 48:02.237
As I wanted.

48:05.503 --> 48:10.703
But I do not understand how did
your delicate finger make these?

48:19.903 --> 48:22.703
You need to make 500 pairs of this mitts
with women before winter ends.

48:23.770 --> 48:25.237
I will do my best, Bey.

48:33.303 --> 48:37.403
Nemrut, from now on
you are my private Alp.

48:38.770 --> 48:41.570
I want to know the wind that blows,
the bird that flies and everything.

48:42.470 --> 48:43.570
Yes, Bey.

48:46.237 --> 48:47.237
Gundogdu Bey.

48:53.270 --> 48:54.970
Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

48:56.403 --> 48:58.470
Bey, if you give permission,
I want to talk.

48:58.637 --> 49:00.270
Of course, you have permission.

49:00.770 --> 49:03.737
Tugtekin wants to talk to Alps.

49:05.637 --> 49:07.970
Bad things reached my ears.
-What happened?

49:09.670 --> 49:14.503
Kayi Alps do not want to obey Tugtekin.

49:15.037 --> 49:16.570
They could not accept it.

49:17.503 --> 49:19.370
What is that they could not accept?

49:20.670 --> 49:23.003
What he did to Ertugrul's Alps.

49:24.337 --> 49:27.470
And they could not accept
what he did to your Alp, Hamza.

49:29.370 --> 49:31.837
They are offended because
they go by the board.

49:33.903 --> 49:35.037
Wild Demir

49:36.470 --> 49:40.770
do we have any mission other than
to protect unity of Kayi

49:41.403 --> 49:42.936
and our nomad people?

49:45.436 --> 49:46.537
No, we do not.

49:47.637 --> 49:50.237
Otherwise, we cannot live on these lands.

49:53.003 --> 49:54.570
Everybody must be aware of this.

49:56.737 --> 50:00.670
Moreover, you wanted to come to these
lands before its time, not me.

50:02.503 --> 50:08.337
Now, tell my words to those watering holes
who told you these.

50:18.603 --> 50:19.703
Take my side.

50:21.303 --> 50:23.437
Let Alps see you on Tugtekin's side.

50:26.337 --> 50:27.637
They will calm down a little.

50:29.370 --> 50:31.437
You know, they respect you.

50:33.503 --> 50:34.670
No, Bey.

50:36.470 --> 50:38.337
I have a more important business.

50:39.770 --> 50:40.870
All right.

50:46.403 --> 50:47.937
What happened, brother?
Is it something important?

50:49.303 --> 50:50.703
No, Tugtekin. It is not.

51:15.737 --> 51:17.303
<i>-God is right!</i>
 <i>-God gives life!</i>

51:17.570 --> 51:18.970
<i>-God is right!</i>
 <i>-God gives life!</i>

51:19.603 --> 51:21.003
<i>-God is right!</i>
 <i>-God gives life!</i>

51:24.537 --> 51:25.870
<i>The time is right, Wild Demir.</i>

51:26.270 --> 51:28.903
<i>I am by your side</i>
 <i>until my last breath, Bey.</i>

51:30.903 --> 51:31.903
<i>God is right!</i>

51:34.870 --> 51:36.037
Oh Bey.

51:37.503 --> 51:38.870
Oh Suleyman Shah.

51:43.803 --> 51:46.270
The union of two nomad tents
should not have been like this.

51:48.003 --> 51:50.303
Our sons are fighting with each other.

51:53.270 --> 51:55.770
How will it be? How?

53:09.270 --> 53:11.837
Brave Alps of Kayi are
at your disposal, Tugtekin Bey.

53:12.870 --> 53:13.970
Thank you.

53:33.703 --> 53:35.703
Brave Alps of Kayi and Dodurga.

53:36.670 --> 53:39.403
We have same blood and traditions.

53:40.637 --> 53:44.570
Now we have same nomad tent and enemy.

53:46.970 --> 53:48.970
Our Beys made a decision in headquarters.

53:50.037 --> 53:52.970
The mission of commanding two nomad tents
were given to me.

53:53.970 --> 53:57.337
Now, it is time to obey and be one.

53:59.503 --> 54:01.237
All Alps must know that

54:02.270 --> 54:06.270
smallest disobedience will be punished

54:07.603 --> 54:09.570
and no mercy will be shown.

55:05.237 --> 55:06.770
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:07.470 --> 55:09.303
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:09.770 --> 55:11.503
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:12.003 --> 55:13.703
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:15.037 --> 55:16.837
My undying brother!

55:17.303 --> 55:18.703
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:19.003 --> 55:21.003
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:23.503 --> 55:24.770
Ertugrul!

55:26.303 --> 55:27.837
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:28.537 --> 55:30.403
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:31.037 --> 55:32.737
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:39.470 --> 55:40.537
My son!

55:41.037 --> 55:42.537
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:42.770 --> 55:44.603
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:44.937 --> 55:46.803
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:55.037 --> 55:56.603
He is not dead, he is alive!

55:57.337 --> 55:58.770
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

55:59.503 --> 56:01.337
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

56:01.737 --> 56:03.503
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

56:10.470 --> 56:12.303
I heard that my Alps
were punished severely

56:12.537 --> 56:14.837
because of various reasons
while I was not here.

56:23.470 --> 56:26.270
I want headquarters to convene and
make a final decision about punishments.

56:40.303 --> 56:41.670
Until the headquarters convene

56:42.837 --> 56:45.637
my Alps will be under my command
in nomad tent.

57:00.003 --> 57:02.737
If there is anyone who protests,
come to the forefront.

57:16.503 --> 57:17.937
Until the headquarters convene

57:19.670 --> 57:21.270
if anyone hurts my Alps

57:22.603 --> 57:23.970
he will face me.

57:27.937 --> 57:29.403
Everyone must know this.

57:35.737 --> 57:36.870
Mother?

57:38.737 --> 57:40.003
Do you have any word?

57:44.503 --> 57:45.570
No, my son.

57:47.503 --> 57:48.737
Uncle?

57:49.970 --> 57:51.503
Do you have any word?

57:57.670 --> 57:58.837
No.

58:06.837 --> 58:09.237
If you say they are under your command

58:10.637 --> 58:12.270
there is nothing I shall say.

58:15.670 --> 58:16.837
You go and rest.

58:39.803 --> 58:40.903
My brother.

59:03.237 --> 59:04.637
My dying day has not come yet, mother.

59:07.370 --> 59:09.303
May God give my life to you.

59:13.837 --> 59:15.003
My son.

59:20.603 --> 59:22.870
Thank God a thousand times.

59:36.303 --> 59:37.403
Welcome, brave son.

59:38.403 --> 59:39.570
Thank you, uncle.

59:48.937 --> 59:50.403
Where is Halime Sultan, mother?

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.437
Where is she, mother?

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:04.370
In her marquee, son.

01:00:26.537 --> 01:00:27.870
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:00:28.303 --> 01:00:29.937
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:00:30.337 --> 01:00:31.903
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:00:45.003 --> 01:00:46.370
Thank God!

01:00:47.837 --> 01:00:48.970
Thank God!

01:00:49.403 --> 01:00:51.637
Thank God! Thank God!

01:00:51.903 --> 01:00:53.503
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:55.637
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:01:15.461 --> 01:01:16.950
Thank God.

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:19.339
Thank God, Bey is alive.

01:01:20.006 --> 01:01:21.673
Thank God.

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:10.373
Halime.

01:02:14.673 --> 01:02:15.773
My darling.

01:02:18.806 --> 01:02:19.839
My beautiful doe.

01:02:22.806 --> 01:02:24.406
<i>We have a long way together.</i>

01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:27.606
<i>Even though the end of the way is obvious,</i>
 <i>it is still ours.</i>

01:02:28.606 --> 01:02:31.839
<i>I do not know our fate</i>
 <i>and the lifetime that God gave us.</i>

01:02:32.806 --> 01:02:36.306
<i>However, as long as I am alive</i>

01:02:36.539 --> 01:02:40.539
<i>I will not let neither you nor my child</i>
 <i>worry about anything, Halime Sultan.</i>

01:02:45.973 --> 01:02:47.073
Come on, wake up.

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.306
<i>I am pregnant, Ertugrul.</i>

01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:53.439
<i>May God always keep you among us.</i>

01:02:53.873 --> 01:02:55.373
I will be a father! A father!

01:02:59.039 --> 01:03:00.806
I am here to free you from your pain.

01:03:02.973 --> 01:03:04.073
Come on, wake up.

01:03:09.973 --> 01:03:11.306
May I come in, Ertugrul Bey?

01:03:13.939 --> 01:03:14.939
Come in, Artuk Bey.

01:03:26.506 --> 01:03:30.573
Now that you are here,
she will get better.

01:03:41.939 --> 01:03:44.606
Thank God, you look very healthy.

01:03:46.506 --> 01:03:50.606
When I see you, I feel like
I am seeing late Suleyman Shah.

01:03:56.606 --> 01:03:57.806
What is Halime Sultan's situation?

01:03:59.373 --> 01:04:00.573
She is in a bad condition.

01:04:00.839 --> 01:04:03.373
She has survived till now,
she did not give up.

01:04:04.439 --> 01:04:06.806
We will lose either the baby or both.

01:04:41.373 --> 01:04:42.373
Son...

01:04:47.039 --> 01:04:48.673
I need to see Wild Demir, mother.

01:04:49.873 --> 01:04:50.873
Go, son.

01:05:01.339 --> 01:05:02.373
Ertugrul.

01:05:04.073 --> 01:05:06.873
My uncle will sacrifice an animal
in his marquee.

01:05:07.439 --> 01:05:10.073
Every animal we sacrifice before
we get Noyan's head is dirty, brother.

01:05:33.606 --> 01:05:34.639
Tugtekin.

01:05:36.339 --> 01:05:37.873
Son, calm down.

01:05:39.873 --> 01:05:43.506
Do you think he gets what he wants just
because he wanted Headquarters to convene?

01:05:44.506 --> 01:05:48.406
He rides the high horse. He thinks
he can get everything he wants.

01:05:49.306 --> 01:05:52.739
We fed them while they were hungry!
We dressed them!

01:05:55.906 --> 01:05:58.606
He wanted Headquarters to convene
in spite of all we have done.

01:06:01.073 --> 01:06:03.839
He asked why we exiled
his Alps at the nomad tent.

01:06:10.506 --> 01:06:12.073
Son, calm down.

01:06:13.873 --> 01:06:15.639
He is still your cousin.

01:06:17.906 --> 01:06:19.773
First, you should be happy he is alive.

01:06:21.406 --> 01:06:22.973
I threw my hat into the ring.

01:06:25.739 --> 01:06:27.039
I will make him pay for this.

01:06:28.306 --> 01:06:31.006
God, give me patience!

01:06:32.673 --> 01:06:33.806
Are you going to shed blood?

01:06:41.839 --> 01:06:43.673
If he does not obey me, I will.

01:06:50.939 --> 01:06:51.939
Bey...

01:06:54.706 --> 01:06:55.773
...with your permission...

01:07:07.673 --> 01:07:09.006
Tugtekin speaks the truth.

01:07:12.573 --> 01:07:14.673
We should nip it in the bud.

01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:20.273
However, there is a certain way
to nip it in the bud, Tugtekin.

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:24.973
In any case, if you sow the wind

01:07:26.039 --> 01:07:28.339
you will reap the whirlwind.
Do not forget that.

01:07:30.673 --> 01:07:31.739
So, what shall I do?

01:07:33.806 --> 01:07:38.406
Two nomad tents are united now,
there is no turning back from this.

01:07:38.839 --> 01:07:40.606
We will invite him
to the Headquarters meeting.

01:07:44.706 --> 01:07:50.573
But it will be Kayi Beys
who do not choose him. Not us.

01:08:02.706 --> 01:08:04.039
And how is this going to happen?

01:08:04.806 --> 01:08:06.973
We will find Ertugrul's weak point, Bey.

01:08:37.306 --> 01:08:38.373
Wild Demir.

01:08:43.939 --> 01:08:47.373
God, please let it be his voice
that I just heard.

01:08:49.339 --> 01:08:50.639
Take my life.

01:09:16.273 --> 01:09:17.473
Thank God.

01:09:36.373 --> 01:09:37.373
Bey.

01:10:06.706 --> 01:10:09.939
Animals being sacrificed,
the meal given to our people...

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.806
Are they doing this to give Ertugrul
what he deserves

01:10:13.573 --> 01:10:15.573
or to convince him?

01:10:18.773 --> 01:10:20.873
The verdict about Ertugrul
has been given.

01:10:23.473 --> 01:10:26.373
From now on,
Tugtekin will command the Alps.

01:10:28.539 --> 01:10:30.439
I know how much you love your brother.

01:10:31.039 --> 01:10:33.039
If you are torn between
your love and nomad tent

01:10:33.639 --> 01:10:35.339
I know you will choose your nomad tent.

01:10:37.373 --> 01:10:39.773
Do not waste Ertugrul
just like that, Gundogdu.

01:10:40.939 --> 01:10:43.873
Because my mother and you
were on the right track yesterday

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:45.906
but Ertugrul is back.

01:10:46.673 --> 01:10:48.973
If you and Mother Hayme
will not take a step backward

01:10:49.306 --> 01:10:50.806
you will go astray.

01:10:52.339 --> 01:10:54.473
My mother and I know
what we are doing, woman.

01:10:55.073 --> 01:10:57.373
You just mind your own business.

01:11:06.006 --> 01:11:09.273
Have you ever seen
that Ertugrul has given up?

01:11:13.473 --> 01:11:15.606
Especially if the mission was given
to him by his father.

01:11:16.073 --> 01:11:19.506
Your verdict will have
no importance for him.

01:11:20.773 --> 01:11:22.639
I said we should not have
gone to Aleppo, but they did!

01:11:23.673 --> 01:11:25.706
I said we should not have
come to Anatolia, but they did!

01:11:26.506 --> 01:11:29.939
They should know better
and not do anything.

01:11:31.506 --> 01:11:33.573
Otherwise, Gundogdu Bey
will make them understand!

01:11:39.273 --> 01:11:40.773
God, please help.

01:12:03.439 --> 01:12:07.906
<i>God, please spare my wife and my child.</i>

01:12:09.839 --> 01:12:12.539
<i>Do not let my descendants go astray.</i>

01:12:13.906 --> 01:12:15.406
<i>Give us strength.</i>

01:12:16.706 --> 01:12:20.839
<i>Help us, so that we can get out of</i>
 <i>this blind hole we are in.</i>

01:12:31.573 --> 01:12:34.773
You will watch every step
Ertugrul and his Alps take.

01:12:35.873 --> 01:12:37.273
What about the other Kayi Alps?

01:12:40.073 --> 01:12:43.606
Try to get them on your side.
Cause a rift between them if necessary.

01:12:44.606 --> 01:12:45.739
Do you understand?

01:12:46.006 --> 01:12:47.673
Do not worry about it, Bey.

01:12:48.839 --> 01:12:50.739
They will be in blind holes.

01:13:36.273 --> 01:13:37.339
Son...

01:13:38.606 --> 01:13:40.706
Your uncle hosts this dinner for you.

01:13:48.939 --> 01:13:50.273
I cannot leave Halime, mother.

01:13:51.506 --> 01:13:54.973
I want her to see me first
when she opens her eyes.

01:13:57.973 --> 01:13:59.573
Are you upset with me...

01:14:01.539 --> 01:14:05.739
...for taking your father's mission
back from you and giving it to Tugtekin?

01:14:07.073 --> 01:14:09.073
Do you resent me?

01:14:12.539 --> 01:14:13.773
You thought I was dead.

01:14:15.439 --> 01:14:18.339
Under those circumstances,
your decision was right.

01:14:21.706 --> 01:14:25.773
However, I am here now, hale and hearty.

01:14:27.673 --> 01:14:32.673
So, your verdict is invalid to me.

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:41.073
I know, you do not want to go
against my uncle

01:14:42.039 --> 01:14:43.639
after all the good things he has done.

01:14:45.506 --> 01:14:47.706
I do not want to reverse your verdict

01:14:47.873 --> 01:14:49.706
and put all the burden on your shoulders.

01:14:52.373 --> 01:14:54.306
How is it going to be, son?

01:14:55.739 --> 01:14:58.506
Let two nomad tent Beys
give the verdict in Headquarters.

01:15:01.806 --> 01:15:03.773
I will tell everything
I know in Headquarters.

01:15:05.539 --> 01:15:08.606
I will tell, so everyone will know
what happened

01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:12.406
and how we are going to fight
with the enemy.

01:15:15.539 --> 01:15:19.473
Then, Beys may vote for their own fate.

01:16:06.439 --> 01:16:07.606
Dinner is ready, mother.

01:16:08.506 --> 01:16:11.973
They are waiting for you.
Do you need anything?

01:16:12.039 --> 01:16:13.073
No, my daughter.

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.273
Now that Ertugrul is back

01:16:19.006 --> 01:16:21.406
from now on
they will stay on the right side

01:16:21.939 --> 01:16:25.706
and you will stay with me on the left side
until you get married.

01:16:27.773 --> 01:16:29.073
Who would marry me, Mother?

01:16:30.939 --> 01:16:33.006
Why not? What do you lack?

01:16:34.706 --> 01:16:36.006
You know what happened.

01:16:37.773 --> 01:16:39.006
What happened?

01:16:40.506 --> 01:16:41.839
When I was stabbed...

01:16:45.406 --> 01:16:48.973
No one can know
whether you will have a baby or not.

01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:51.573
It is the will of God.

01:16:52.439 --> 01:16:54.839
Who would risk it and marry me, Mother?

01:16:58.539 --> 01:17:03.339
My beautiful daughter, every man
who loves you will take that risk.

01:17:04.339 --> 01:17:05.406
Alright?

01:17:27.906 --> 01:17:30.339
<i>You chose a warrior wife like yourself.</i>

01:17:30.573 --> 01:17:32.339
If you will be our enemy

01:17:32.539 --> 01:17:35.939
she will be the victim of this war
sooner or later.

01:17:36.439 --> 01:17:38.773
Your wife and all the people you love.

01:17:46.073 --> 01:17:47.606
<i>So you will resist.</i>

01:17:47.773 --> 01:17:50.439
<i>This torture will not end</i>
 <i>until you obey me.</i>

01:18:04.806 --> 01:18:05.873
Ertugrul.

01:18:10.306 --> 01:18:11.439
I am back, Halime Sultan.

01:18:14.039 --> 01:18:15.273
I am back.

01:18:17.673 --> 01:18:18.906
You never left, anyway.

01:18:20.806 --> 01:18:22.306
You have always been here.

01:18:22.939 --> 01:18:24.773
How can I go
leaving you and my baby alone?

01:19:08.006 --> 01:19:10.906
Your nephew you hosted dinner for
did not honor your dinner.

01:19:18.739 --> 01:19:21.406
Where did this
Headquarters idea come from?

01:19:21.773 --> 01:19:24.406
It is impudent to object Beys' verdict.

01:19:25.273 --> 01:19:26.973
Ertugrul wanted Headquarters to convene

01:19:28.373 --> 01:19:29.806
and Beys agreed.

01:19:30.706 --> 01:19:35.073
You will ask this question to the
Beys of the Headquarters, not to me.

01:19:36.273 --> 01:19:38.739
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:19:38.939 --> 01:19:40.073
And peace be upon you.

01:19:57.939 --> 01:19:59.306
My dear God

01:20:00.006 --> 01:20:01.939
heaven only knows why

01:20:02.639 --> 01:20:06.673
but you granted us such a beautiful day.
God, thank you.

01:20:12.373 --> 01:20:13.773
Welcome home, son.

01:20:14.673 --> 01:20:17.973
You made us happy by coming back.

01:20:18.739 --> 01:20:22.473
Thank you, uncle.
You welcomed us, shared your food.

01:20:23.806 --> 01:20:25.973
The Kayi Tent will not forget this.

01:20:27.706 --> 01:20:29.839
This is the bravery of Dodurga.

01:20:31.473 --> 01:20:35.906
We welcome, share our food
and be a comrade.

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:45.773
Very good for you, Tugtekin.

01:20:46.873 --> 01:20:48.506
Not anyone in your position

01:20:50.973 --> 01:20:53.306
will share his food as you do.

01:21:05.806 --> 01:21:09.406
Sisters, bring the lamb.
Let us start now.

01:21:11.873 --> 01:21:14.573
We must take care of
Ertugrul Bey and Halime Hatun.

01:21:25.006 --> 01:21:26.806
Tugtekin, Tugtekin.

01:21:28.306 --> 01:21:29.506
You are a good man

01:21:30.473 --> 01:21:34.773
but you have a long way
to compete with Ertugrul.

01:21:38.873 --> 01:21:43.673
Well, bard, play something
so we pull ourselves together.

01:21:44.473 --> 01:21:45.606
Of course, Bey.

01:22:01.606 --> 01:22:04.739
<i>We will campaign to Georgia</i>

01:22:05.273 --> 01:22:08.339
<i>Anybody can come to our province</i>

01:22:08.706 --> 01:22:11.739
<i>But come only if you are brave</i>

01:22:11.973 --> 01:22:15.573
<i>Only if you pass the bloody creek</i>

01:22:15.973 --> 01:22:19.073
<i>We will campaign to Mongol</i>

01:22:19.573 --> 01:22:22.706
<i>Anybody can come to our province</i>

01:22:23.006 --> 01:22:26.306
<i>But come only if you are brave</i>

01:22:26.506 --> 01:22:30.073
<i>Only if you pass the bloody creek</i>

01:22:30.439 --> 01:22:33.539
<i>But come only if you are brave</i>

01:22:33.773 --> 01:22:37.339
<i>Only if you pass the bloody creek</i>

01:22:52.073 --> 01:22:55.073
<i>Listen to the words of the brave men</i>

01:22:55.606 --> 01:22:58.673
<i>Let us get down to the arena</i>

01:22:59.073 --> 01:23:02.006
<i>Come only if you can wear</i>

01:23:02.406 --> 01:23:05.906
<i>The shirt of death</i>

01:23:06.539 --> 01:23:09.406
<i>Come only if you can wear</i>

01:23:09.639 --> 01:23:12.906
<i>The shirt of death</i>

01:23:13.673 --> 01:23:16.839
<i>Listen to the words of the brave men</i>

01:23:17.073 --> 01:23:20.339
<i>I pander to my beauty's whims</i>

01:23:20.739 --> 01:23:23.706
<i>The real daughter of Georgia</i>

01:23:23.973 --> 01:23:27.539
<i>Come if you can take her away</i>

01:23:27.873 --> 01:23:30.839
<i>The real daughter of Georgia</i>

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:34.873
<i>Come if you can take her away</i>

01:23:42.573 --> 01:23:45.306
<i>Blood flowing through the sword</i>

01:23:45.573 --> 01:23:51.339
<i>Come if you can face it</i>

01:24:10.573 --> 01:24:11.806
If it were not for Geyikli

01:24:13.306 --> 01:24:14.839
I could not have escaped
from those tyrants.

01:24:16.339 --> 01:24:18.839
-What is Geyikli like?
-He is a Bayirbucak Turkmen.

01:24:20.339 --> 01:24:23.606
He lives in mountains, plains and forests.

01:24:27.973 --> 01:24:29.773
Let me unroll it. Give it to me.

01:24:34.739 --> 01:24:38.839
I could come back here
thanks to you, gazelle-eyes.

01:24:41.039 --> 01:24:42.539
To see you once more

01:24:44.039 --> 01:24:45.673
to hear your voice once more.

01:24:48.739 --> 01:24:51.373
My soul did not leave my body

01:24:52.739 --> 01:24:54.906
because I believed that
you were alive, Ertugrul.

01:25:02.273 --> 01:25:03.306
Ertugrul!

01:25:07.073 --> 01:25:08.339
Ertugrul!

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:14.373
-Do not tell anyone.
-What did they do to you, my brave man?

01:25:16.673 --> 01:25:18.539
How can you grab a sword with this hand?

01:25:23.706 --> 01:25:26.573
You grab the sword with your heart,
not with your hand.

01:26:16.673 --> 01:26:18.806
Ertugrul must accept
the situation, mother.

01:26:20.406 --> 01:26:21.806
And only you can make him do that.

01:26:23.639 --> 01:26:25.539
Otherwise, we cannot
keep the two nomad tents together.

01:26:25.873 --> 01:26:27.006
How so, son?

01:26:28.273 --> 01:26:30.339
I saw the rage in Ertugrul's eyes, mother.

01:26:32.073 --> 01:26:37.506
I knew, yet the storm in his heart
is bigger than the Flood.

01:26:38.906 --> 01:26:41.073
He will not rest until he kills Noyan.

01:26:42.339 --> 01:26:45.606
He will go after Noyan like he did
for Petruchio and Titus.

01:26:47.306 --> 01:26:50.706
We brought their castle down on them,
but that was luck.

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:52.739
However, it is not the same now.

01:26:53.973 --> 01:26:58.639
After all this pain
we cannot face a new pain, Mother.

01:27:10.039 --> 01:27:11.073
Alright, son.

01:27:13.906 --> 01:27:16.073
Let us enjoy his return now.

01:28:08.473 --> 01:28:13.039
Where are you going
with this wounded hand, Ertugrul?

01:28:18.573 --> 01:28:20.273
Artuk Bey will heal my hand.

01:28:20.973 --> 01:28:22.306
He is waiting for me.

01:28:22.906 --> 01:28:24.373
I will be back in the evening.

01:28:36.639 --> 01:28:39.606
I know you want to get your mission back
and seek your revenge.

01:28:42.639 --> 01:28:44.439
Everytime you go to a mission

01:28:45.906 --> 01:28:50.373
I bid farewell to you to be a martyr.

01:28:52.639 --> 01:28:54.906
But this time
everything is different, Ertugrul.

01:28:55.706 --> 01:28:57.273
What has changed, Halime Sultan?

01:29:01.473 --> 01:29:02.539
I saw your hand.

01:29:08.606 --> 01:29:10.439
You cannot even eat soup with this hand

01:29:11.673 --> 01:29:13.939
let alone fight, Ertugrul.

01:29:15.473 --> 01:29:16.639
I know...

01:29:19.339 --> 01:29:22.539
...your motherly love
makes you say these words.

01:29:23.773 --> 01:29:27.039
I am neither angry at you
nor will I tell anything bad to you.

01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:33.373
You do not want to raise
our baby without his father.

01:29:33.773 --> 01:29:34.973
However...

01:29:36.706 --> 01:29:40.639
...I am not only your husband
and the father of our baby.

01:29:43.439 --> 01:29:44.939
I am the commander of Kayi Alps.

01:29:46.706 --> 01:29:51.439
I am entrusted with Kayi babies' lives
and their mothers' honor.

01:29:53.573 --> 01:29:55.439
I failed that trust once.

01:29:57.506 --> 01:30:00.873
Remember the lives we have lost.

01:30:02.806 --> 01:30:04.773
We came to my uncle's tribe
like parasites.

01:30:05.739 --> 01:30:09.773
Let the winter pass
and you get better, then...

01:30:09.939 --> 01:30:11.706
There is no then, Halime Sultan.

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:15.039
We do not have a winter to wait.
We do not have even a day.

01:30:16.806 --> 01:30:20.639
If I do not go out today,
there will be a lot of bloodshed.

01:30:22.773 --> 01:30:23.839
Noyan will die.

01:30:25.306 --> 01:30:26.406
He has to.

01:31:07.339 --> 01:31:09.506
Kocabash won Gundogdu's favor.

01:31:11.306 --> 01:31:13.273
Kocabash acted wisely.

01:31:14.573 --> 01:31:16.539
Scarf headed had already deserved to die.

01:31:20.573 --> 01:31:21.639
There is more.

01:31:25.073 --> 01:31:26.073
What is it?

01:31:26.406 --> 01:31:28.439
Gumushtekin and his daughter Goncagul.

01:31:29.873 --> 01:31:33.673
They are returning from Konya
after meeting with Sultan Alaeddin.

01:31:35.006 --> 01:31:36.706
They will be in the nomad tent soon.

01:31:37.973 --> 01:31:41.873
Tugtekin and Gundogdu
will go to Harput to get them.

01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:44.473
So?

01:31:46.073 --> 01:31:48.339
So, they will fall into our trap.

01:31:49.873 --> 01:31:51.773
Ertugrul? What about him?

01:31:53.539 --> 01:31:55.773
If the Headquarters decide
against Ertugrul

01:31:56.539 --> 01:31:58.773
we will not need to do anything.

01:32:00.006 --> 01:32:02.473
They will fall out with each other
like all Turks.

01:32:33.406 --> 01:32:34.573
You?

01:32:36.939 --> 01:32:38.873
Welcome to my humble house, Hamza Alp.

01:33:09.273 --> 01:33:10.373
Look at them!

01:33:24.439 --> 01:33:25.873
Why are they grinning?

01:33:36.873 --> 01:33:38.339
-Let me find out.
-Abdurrahman!

01:33:42.339 --> 01:33:43.339
Mind your own business.

01:33:47.373 --> 01:33:51.639
Ertugrul Bey does not want any problems
before the Headquarters convene.

01:34:02.739 --> 01:34:07.039
What are you going to do with Ertugrul Bey
after the Headquarters, Dogan?

01:34:09.906 --> 01:34:11.406
What are you going to do? Tell me.

01:34:17.373 --> 01:34:19.473
You will herd animals together,
Dogan, right?

01:34:21.773 --> 01:34:22.773
Dogan!

01:34:30.639 --> 01:34:31.639
Alps!

01:34:32.939 --> 01:34:34.539
Mind your own business, Alps!

01:35:10.773 --> 01:35:11.873
I will...

01:35:16.573 --> 01:35:18.673
-Give me that boy!
-Take him if you can!

01:35:24.006 --> 01:35:28.573
Since when Tugtekin's Alps
show their bravery to boys?

01:35:30.806 --> 01:35:33.806
We are trying to teach manners
to Ertugrul's Alps, Master Demir.

01:35:35.906 --> 01:35:39.606
You...
I will smash that big head of yours!

01:35:41.406 --> 01:35:42.473
Stop!

01:35:49.439 --> 01:35:52.073
The dogs bark, yet the caravan goes on.

01:35:54.606 --> 01:35:57.406
There will be no problems
before the Headquarters convene.

01:35:57.506 --> 01:35:59.673
Mind your own business.

01:36:07.706 --> 01:36:08.739
Let's go.

01:36:29.006 --> 01:36:30.073
Who is this boy?

01:36:30.506 --> 01:36:32.639
Son of Ilgordu Alp
who was martyred in ambush.

01:36:34.039 --> 01:36:35.273
Turali.

01:36:36.739 --> 01:36:39.639
After everyone in his family died,
he stopped talking.

01:36:44.306 --> 01:36:45.373
Turali.

01:36:46.506 --> 01:36:49.606
From now on, he is my bravest Alp.

01:36:56.606 --> 01:36:57.673
Where is Ertugrul Bey?

01:36:58.639 --> 01:36:59.973
He went to see Artuk Bey.

01:37:01.373 --> 01:37:02.606
He will show his hand.

01:37:04.273 --> 01:37:07.339
Until the Headquarters is over,
please behave yourselves.

01:37:08.373 --> 01:37:09.673
Otherwise, we will be in trouble.

01:37:44.973 --> 01:37:46.406
How is my hand, Artuk Bey?

01:37:50.306 --> 01:37:51.839
I cannot lie to you, Ertugrul.

01:37:52.473 --> 01:37:56.439
It is almost impossible
to use a sword with this hand.

01:38:12.306 --> 01:38:14.273
Yet Geyikli did a good job.

01:38:15.906 --> 01:38:19.273
God forbid, I may have had
to cut your hand.

01:38:26.906 --> 01:38:28.273
Thank God, I have two hands.

01:38:31.573 --> 01:38:32.739
I can fight with my right hand.

01:38:35.906 --> 01:38:36.973
In the worst case

01:38:38.639 --> 01:38:41.439
I will cut that bastard's heart out
with my teeth.

01:38:52.439 --> 01:38:54.773
Halime Sultan must apply this cream
to your hand every night.

01:38:55.606 --> 01:38:59.473
Then she will bandage it
with a clean cheesecloth.

01:39:00.373 --> 01:39:01.373
Thank you.

01:39:06.439 --> 01:39:08.906
What do you think about me
getting my mission back?

01:39:13.706 --> 01:39:15.539
My heart is with you.

01:39:17.373 --> 01:39:22.373
But I might have to obey Bey.

01:39:24.473 --> 01:39:26.373
I do not know what verdict
I will give in Headquarters.

01:39:27.339 --> 01:39:30.406
It depends on you, and your words.

01:39:32.606 --> 01:39:34.539
Other Beys are confused as well.

01:39:46.939 --> 01:39:48.539
Korkut Bey wants to see you, Ertugrul Bey.

01:40:14.606 --> 01:40:16.939
Thank God, you are back, Ertugrul Bey.

01:40:18.439 --> 01:40:19.573
Thank you, Aytolun Hatun.

01:40:20.473 --> 01:40:24.673
I wish you happiness with your baby.
May you bring him up in peace.

01:40:27.006 --> 01:40:30.373
Halime Sultan suffered a lot
while you were gone.

01:40:31.706 --> 01:40:33.339
Have som rest this winter.

01:40:33.839 --> 01:40:37.039
Tugtekin will handle
your mission properly.

01:40:38.406 --> 01:40:41.006
Also, you can help Halime Sultan
during her pregnancy.

01:40:43.039 --> 01:40:45.839
When Mongols arrive,
your baby will be born.

01:40:46.406 --> 01:40:47.573
Be with them.

01:40:51.306 --> 01:40:54.973
Anyway, may God help us all.

01:40:57.406 --> 01:40:58.639
Thank you, sister-in-law.

01:40:59.406 --> 01:41:00.906
May God give you a baby, too.

01:41:54.024 --> 01:41:57.757
Tell me Eymish Baci,
is Ertugrul Bey alright?

01:42:02.024 --> 01:42:03.090
Speak!

01:42:05.424 --> 01:42:07.357
What is wrong with our brave heart?

01:42:19.757 --> 01:42:22.357
It was unpleasant for you to bring this
matter to the headquarters, nephew.

01:42:24.324 --> 01:42:26.790
You disregarded me and your mother.

01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:29.990
I handled this matter without
disregarding you and my mother.

01:42:30.724 --> 01:42:32.757
<i>I know that headquarters will give</i>
 <i>the right judgement.</i>

01:42:33.324 --> 01:42:35.257
Headquarters' judgment will put neither me

01:42:35.357 --> 01:42:37.057
nor you in an inconvenient position.

01:42:38.157 --> 01:42:40.957
You show your cunning
as well as your strenght.

01:42:41.957 --> 01:42:44.624
If your late father was alive,
he would be proud of you.

01:42:45.657 --> 01:42:46.657
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:42:49.057 --> 01:42:50.357
Excuse me.

01:43:05.224 --> 01:43:08.624
Mother Aytolun was right.
He will cause trouble, father.

01:43:08.957 --> 01:43:10.790
He will give us a headache.

01:43:13.090 --> 01:43:15.157
He wants the mission, his father gave him.

01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:17.724
But there is nothing to worry about.

01:43:18.224 --> 01:43:20.257
He will obey the headquarters' judgment.

01:43:21.690 --> 01:43:23.790
What if their judgment is against us?

01:43:24.757 --> 01:43:28.624
What if Kayi Beys kick up a fuss?
Even our Beys.

01:43:30.624 --> 01:43:33.924
So, do not stop, son. Do your best.

01:44:10.157 --> 01:44:11.390
What do you want from me, Noyan?

01:44:12.624 --> 01:44:13.790
Why don't you kill me?

01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:19.990
I need brave and strong warriors like you.

01:44:21.624 --> 01:44:24.424
You want me to betray
my nomad tent, don't you?

01:44:25.090 --> 01:44:30.357
No. I offer you an opportunity
to become a great commander of the Kayis.

01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:38.957
How will this happen?

01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:44.090
If Kayis serve to Ogeday, not Aleaddin

01:44:44.890 --> 01:44:46.957
I will not have to kill your kind.

01:44:48.757 --> 01:44:53.324
I promise you fame, glory
and gold in Ogeday's army.

01:44:54.724 --> 01:44:58.424
Most beautiful women, fastest of horses

01:44:59.257 --> 01:45:01.390
and the sharpest swords can be yours.

01:45:02.357 --> 01:45:05.324
I offer you a chance to become a commander
in the largest army you've seen

01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:07.657
which will conquer the world.

01:45:27.190 --> 01:45:29.824
None of them wants to see
the danger Noyan possess.

01:45:31.290 --> 01:45:33.224
What do Mother Hayme
and Gundogdu Bey think?

01:45:35.290 --> 01:45:36.990
I will convince my mother and brother.

01:45:37.924 --> 01:45:40.924
But we must take all the votes
in the headquarters.

01:45:42.224 --> 01:45:43.657
What are we going to do, Bey?

01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:48.757
Talk the Beys of every headquarters.

01:45:51.057 --> 01:45:54.224
Tell everyone why I want to be
the commander of Alps.

01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:59.090
Tell them I am not after position.

01:46:00.057 --> 01:46:04.190
If we attack before Noyan attacks us,
victory can be ours.

01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:11.690
Otherwise, Noyan will pillage our lands,
and kill everyone.

01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:17.090
Talk with everyone.

01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:20.224
-Yes, Bey.
-As you wish, Bey.

01:46:22.190 --> 01:46:24.224
Abdurrahman, your mission is...

01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:30.290
...to be my spy in Noyan's army.

01:46:32.157 --> 01:46:34.090
We will ask Geyikli's help for this.

01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:39.124
But we need to handle the business
in the headquarters.

01:46:41.124 --> 01:46:42.990
Or all our plans will be in vain.

01:46:48.057 --> 01:46:49.957
We must give hell to Noyan.

01:48:05.857 --> 01:48:07.090
What if I do not accept?

01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:19.224
Your horse is ready for you
with your weapons.

01:48:20.090 --> 01:48:22.257
You are free to leave anytime you want.

01:48:23.157 --> 01:48:25.624
You are useless to me when you are dead.

01:48:26.757 --> 01:48:29.624
On the contrary, I would be sorry
if you would die.

01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:38.924
You are smart enough to understand
the importance of my offer.

01:48:39.190 --> 01:48:41.390
We both know you have nowhere else to go.

01:48:42.624 --> 01:48:46.124
Moreover, your need for vengeance
consumes you.

01:48:47.224 --> 01:48:51.724
You hate your Bey, whom you wasted
your life for.

01:48:52.357 --> 01:48:56.657
I offer you opportunity of getting
revenge from Gundogdu.

01:49:01.857 --> 01:49:05.690
Decision is yours.
You can be my guest tonight if you like.

01:49:07.857 --> 01:49:11.724
Think. We will talk in the morning,
in the cold light of the day.

01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:20.990
Canfeda, come here!

01:49:31.824 --> 01:49:32.824
Yes, Bey.

01:49:50.057 --> 01:49:51.890
Hamza Alp is my guest.

01:49:53.224 --> 01:49:55.357
You will serve him until he leaves.

01:50:27.924 --> 01:50:29.090
Turali!

01:50:31.357 --> 01:50:34.057
Turali! Wait, son!

01:50:37.124 --> 01:50:38.190
Turali!

01:50:43.224 --> 01:50:44.324
He is a brave boy.

01:50:50.724 --> 01:50:51.924
Just like you.

01:50:53.824 --> 01:50:56.990
When Ertugrul Bey brought you to me,
you were like him.

01:50:57.424 --> 01:51:00.124
As wild and brave as he is.

01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:02.657
And a handful I must say.

01:51:06.657 --> 01:51:09.090
Tugtekin and Gundogdu are talking to Beys.

01:51:10.057 --> 01:51:12.157
Is it strange that
they are not talking to you?

01:51:12.857 --> 01:51:14.290
We know what are they saying.

01:51:15.890 --> 01:51:17.890
They know I will not change my side.

01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:24.990
Now, two of them together
will cause trouble for our Bey.

01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:33.157
In the name of God.

01:52:45.824 --> 01:52:47.224
Gokce is a skillful girl.

01:52:48.690 --> 01:52:49.990
They suit you well.

01:52:51.357 --> 01:52:53.624
I did not imagine that
she would be this good.

01:52:57.090 --> 01:52:59.790
Tugtekin, you have feelings for Gokce.

01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:02.090
I can talk to your father if you like.

01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:04.024
Not now, mother.

01:53:05.624 --> 01:53:07.890
We will talk after I handle Ertugrul.

01:53:09.190 --> 01:53:10.324
Alright.

01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:12.757
What did you do?

01:53:13.224 --> 01:53:15.257
Did you talk to Beys?
What is their reaction?

01:53:18.157 --> 01:53:19.357
Kayis are reluctant.

01:53:20.890 --> 01:53:24.624
Alps want Ertugrul Bey.
Mother Hayme does not know what to do.

01:53:25.857 --> 01:53:28.657
-Wild Demir is as usual.
-What about our Beys?

01:53:30.024 --> 01:53:31.424
I have my doubts about Artuk Bey.

01:53:33.024 --> 01:53:34.624
He does not breathe a word about it.

01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:37.157
What about Horseless and Ayhan?

01:53:37.890 --> 01:53:41.224
They think that it could cost us dearly
to waste Ertugrul Bey.

01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:46.324
Ertugrul does not want to give up
being the commander of Alps.

01:53:48.124 --> 01:53:50.124
Beys do not want to waste him.

01:53:53.890 --> 01:53:56.890
So, there is only one thing to do.

01:53:57.924 --> 01:53:58.957
What?

01:53:59.624 --> 01:54:02.290
If we rob him of his position as an Alp...

01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:06.024
...we solve our problem.

01:54:20.657 --> 01:54:22.890
He will not stop until
he kills Noyan, mother.

01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:27.224
But...

01:54:28.990 --> 01:54:30.390
...there is something worse.

01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:35.190
What?

01:54:37.124 --> 01:54:38.357
His hand, mother.

01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:42.924
It is impossible for him to grab a sword
with his hand.

01:54:44.824 --> 01:54:46.190
What happened to his hand?

01:54:48.257 --> 01:54:51.757
Bastard Noyan drove nails to his hand.

01:54:59.357 --> 01:55:00.957
Good God!

01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:06.857
Good God!

01:55:08.024 --> 01:55:09.390
Good God!

01:55:10.690 --> 01:55:12.757
What can a man do without his sword?

01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:18.890
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:55:21.690 --> 01:55:22.790
Where did he go?

01:55:23.924 --> 01:55:25.090
I do not know, mother.

01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:29.990
He went to Artuk Bey to show his hand,
then he will see someone else.

01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:32.657
He did not tell me where he was going.

01:55:34.290 --> 01:55:37.824
Mother. I beg you, talk to him.

01:55:40.957 --> 01:55:42.657
It does not make a difference, daughter.

01:55:45.024 --> 01:55:47.090
Beys on the headquarters
will make their judgment.

01:55:50.857 --> 01:55:52.657
But what about your judgment?

01:56:16.324 --> 01:56:17.790
What are you doing, Gokce?

01:56:20.657 --> 01:56:23.024
I was about to call Mother Hayme.

01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:26.857
-Are they inside?
-Yes.

01:56:29.357 --> 01:56:30.624
Bey.

01:56:34.424 --> 01:56:36.257
You gave me life with your return.

01:56:37.090 --> 01:56:38.757
May God give you strength.

01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:41.724
Amen, Gokce.

01:56:42.290 --> 01:56:43.757
Amen.

01:56:56.290 --> 01:56:57.624
Mother.

01:57:02.690 --> 01:57:03.824
Halime Sultan.

01:57:29.724 --> 01:57:32.357
-Peace be with you.
-And peace be with you.

01:58:38.890 --> 01:58:40.824
In the name of God.

01:58:43.690 --> 01:58:45.690
With the 99 names of God Almighty,

01:58:47.224 --> 01:58:52.857
creator of all existence,
For he filles our hearts with faith.

01:58:53.857 --> 01:58:55.024
Beys.

01:58:56.724 --> 01:58:58.024
Brave men.

01:58:59.657 --> 01:59:01.624
Saints of our nomad tent.

01:59:02.357 --> 01:59:06.290
Welcome to the headquarters.

01:59:11.124 --> 01:59:15.057
We are here to talk about
the situation of exiled Alps

01:59:15.857 --> 01:59:22.757
and the position of Ertugrul Bey,
as the commander of Alps.

01:59:27.890 --> 01:59:34.257
With the permission of Korkut Bey,
I open this session.

02:00:34.124 --> 02:00:36.157
No matter what the headquarters decides,

02:00:36.224 --> 02:00:38.290
there will not be any peace
in our nomad tent, Halime.

02:00:39.357 --> 02:00:43.690
At least you and my mother
do not go against Ertugrul Bey.

02:00:45.724 --> 02:00:47.824
I told him bad things, Selcan.

02:00:50.124 --> 02:00:51.624
I hurt him deeply.

02:00:53.657 --> 02:00:56.090
My baby prevented me
from seeing the truth.

02:01:00.157 --> 02:01:01.857
But it is too late now.

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:06.690
Why are saying this, Halime?

02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:10.724
Mother Hayme...

02:01:12.190 --> 02:01:16.957
...will never let her son
challenge death in his condition.

02:01:20.824 --> 02:01:22.424
His condition, Halime?

02:01:24.224 --> 02:01:25.757
What are you talking about?

02:01:31.124 --> 02:01:32.290
Halime?

02:02:05.624 --> 02:02:06.824
May it be easy.

02:02:07.857 --> 02:02:08.990
Thank you.

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:15.424
Ertugrul Bey is prudent enough
to do everything for his nomad tent.

02:02:16.357 --> 02:02:18.090
I know and believe it by heart.

02:02:18.424 --> 02:02:21.390
But after all, he is a human being.

02:02:23.957 --> 02:02:28.657
After headquarters' judgment,
take care of your man, Halime Sultan.

02:02:30.824 --> 02:02:34.890
Do not let him be obsessed and
drag us into trouble.

02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:41.157
You are trying to waste him
in his most difficult day.

02:02:44.290 --> 02:02:47.357
What are you going to do
when you are in trouble?

02:02:50.057 --> 02:02:52.390
Pray, Ertugrul Bey will be there for you.

02:03:15.824 --> 02:03:17.790
It is a known fact that
a Mongol soldier...

02:03:19.124 --> 02:03:20.390
...can go to a village and...

02:03:21.157 --> 02:03:26.724
...behead all men, women and children...

02:03:27.690 --> 02:03:30.724
...in a village all by himself.

02:03:33.657 --> 02:03:35.290
People are scared.

02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:41.057
First, we need to conquer this fear.

02:03:43.224 --> 02:03:45.324
Waiting for war all winter long

02:03:46.290 --> 02:03:50.090
is not different than
waiting to die in your own grave.

02:03:50.924 --> 02:03:52.357
Tell us what you are thinking.

02:03:57.124 --> 02:04:01.357
We must conquer the fear of people,
who are paying tribute to bastard Noyan.

02:04:02.824 --> 02:04:04.724
We must be their hope...

02:04:06.224 --> 02:04:09.657
...so those bastards dare not
ask for anything.

02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:15.824
We must cut the flow of gold of merchants

02:04:16.424 --> 02:04:19.790
who are supplying food to the Mongol army.

02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:24.124
This way they will know,

02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:27.257
we will cut their hands
if they accept their gold.

02:04:28.757 --> 02:04:34.124
From now on, we do not have time to
be on the defensive.

02:04:35.190 --> 02:04:38.390
We will attack that bastard Noyan
and give him hell...

02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:42.657
...so that he will understand his army
cannot stay here.

02:04:45.157 --> 02:04:46.224
And then?

02:04:48.057 --> 02:04:49.424
That is why...

02:04:52.724 --> 02:04:55.790
...I want my position back, which was
given me by my father Suleyman Shah...

02:04:57.790 --> 02:05:01.824
...to attack that bastard Noyan
and give hell.

02:05:39.957 --> 02:05:42.824
How much longer this headquarters last?
It drags on.

02:05:45.824 --> 02:05:48.624
Our Bey must have opened their eyes.

02:05:52.690 --> 02:05:53.924
Among us...

02:05:55.324 --> 02:05:57.290
...Ertugrul Bey is the one who
knows Mongols best.

02:05:58.824 --> 02:06:00.690
Because he went into their den.

02:06:01.957 --> 02:06:04.290
Sooner or later the headquarters
will understand this.

02:06:05.424 --> 02:06:09.757
Then Ertugrul Bey will be
the commander of Alps again.

02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:11.757
Do not worry.

02:06:14.990 --> 02:06:18.890
Ertugrul Bey's words are true
without a doubt.

02:06:20.090 --> 02:06:23.157
But I do not know how would we do it?

02:06:24.057 --> 02:06:28.057
Preventing merchants who feed
Noyan's army,

02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:31.324
supporting nearby villages

02:06:31.857 --> 02:06:36.690
and tracking spies is not an easy task.

02:06:37.057 --> 02:06:38.957
But it is not impossible.

02:06:39.157 --> 02:06:43.257
Ertugrul Bey's word impressed me,
he speaks the truth.

02:06:48.757 --> 02:06:53.424
What if Bastard Noyan attacks us
again in a weak moment

02:06:54.157 --> 02:06:59.224
and slaughter our women, children, Alps

02:06:59.290 --> 02:07:01.224
and animals?

02:07:03.024 --> 02:07:04.324
What are we going to do then?

02:07:06.957 --> 02:07:10.890
We are at war, brother.
We must take necessary precautions.

02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:14.924
What precautions are you
talking about, Ertugrul Bey?

02:07:16.290 --> 02:07:19.257
An Alps life is his sword hand.

02:07:22.424 --> 02:07:24.624
You already lost your hand to Noyan.

02:07:26.057 --> 02:07:27.257
So your life belongs to him.

02:07:35.324 --> 02:07:39.890
How could an Alp who cannot even grab a
sword, take command of all the Alps?

02:07:46.090 --> 02:07:47.824
What are you talking about, Tugtekin?

02:07:48.690 --> 02:07:50.224
Do you hear yourself?

02:07:51.090 --> 02:07:53.157
Ask it Artuk Bey, not me, my Bey.

02:07:57.724 --> 02:08:00.257
Artuk, is he right?

02:08:04.757 --> 02:08:06.024
He is right, Bey.

02:08:07.090 --> 02:08:09.924
They damaged his hand
when they drove nails in it.

02:08:13.124 --> 02:08:15.690
I do not know if it will heal or not.

02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:20.357
But it is certain that it will not heal

02:08:21.424 --> 02:08:23.090
before the the war in spring.

02:08:59.090 --> 02:09:00.157
Look.

02:09:09.190 --> 02:09:12.890
-Will he fit in this, Selcan?
-Of course, he will.

02:09:29.224 --> 02:09:30.890
When will headquarters end?

02:09:34.924 --> 02:09:38.657
They cannot take away his right,
unless they play a trick on him.

02:09:42.190 --> 02:09:44.757
I do not know which is better, Selcan.

02:09:59.024 --> 02:10:00.890
We listened everyone.

02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:06.957
Now, we must hear Beys' judgment,
Hayme Sister.

02:10:13.290 --> 02:10:15.257
The time is up, Bey.

02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:26.324
So, to prevent a conflict
among our Alps...

02:10:28.290 --> 02:10:30.857
...until our nomad tents split up again...

02:10:32.357 --> 02:10:36.090
...I put to vote that Tugtekin be the
commander of Alps...

02:10:40.324 --> 02:10:44.657
...and take away Ertugrul
Bey's position of Alp...

02:10:45.757 --> 02:10:48.424
...until he heals.

02:10:52.190 --> 02:10:53.424
Ayes?
