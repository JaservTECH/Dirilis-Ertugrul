00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 41 will start after 12:31 min.

12:31.323 --> 12:35.323
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:36.587 --> 12:40.263
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:40.578 --> 12:43.578
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

12:55.565 --> 13:00.198
Tell us, Ertugrul,
the son of Suleyman Shah.

13:02.265 --> 13:05.598
What was the crimes of your state to
make you kill Ertokush?

13:06.165 --> 13:09.365
What was the crimes of Dodurga Tribe to
make you kill two brave warriors?

13:10.332 --> 13:13.198
We will consult the Fiqh book
regarding your case.

13:14.365 --> 13:15.465
Now you may speak.

13:27.532 --> 13:29.565
First you must know that...

13:30.765 --> 13:32.832
...I have come before you by my own will.

13:35.298 --> 13:37.465
Otherwise none of you
would be able to capture me.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.598
I wanted to be here.

13:48.465 --> 13:53.465
So that the elders of my tribe would know
who the real villains are.

13:58.365 --> 14:01.732
Stop playing with words
and answer the question.

14:03.265 --> 14:05.365
Your false justice

14:06.165 --> 14:09.198
is created to be the end of Oghuz Tribe.

14:10.198 --> 14:14.165
If you say another word,
our justice will fall on you right now.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.498
Elders of my Tribe.

14:29.732 --> 14:32.865
Ever since the first day I held a sword,

14:33.432 --> 14:35.665
I have not spilled any innocent blood.

14:37.798 --> 14:41.298
I have stood against the wicked.

14:42.532 --> 14:47.898
Because I know very well that when a
single tyrant stops breathing...

14:49.732 --> 14:51.665
...thousands of oppressed would rejoiced.

14:55.532 --> 14:57.298
Considering this fact

14:57.498 --> 15:02.865
how could I end the lives of
Atabey Ertokush and Tugtekin?

15:03.832 --> 15:04.832
Eh?

15:06.798 --> 15:07.932
How?

15:16.298 --> 15:19.532
I beheaded the traitor Kocabash.

15:21.498 --> 15:22.865
Fortunately.

15:27.465 --> 15:30.532
Is it your duty to behead a traitor?

15:31.865 --> 15:36.298
If you blindly host a traitor
under your nose, then yes, uncle.

15:40.265 --> 15:41.898
-What are we going to do?
-How can this be?

15:45.665 --> 15:48.932
-This is treachery.
-Impossible.

15:50.398 --> 15:52.265
He cannot do such a thing.

15:52.332 --> 15:56.198
Silence! This a trial, not a wedding!

16:04.665 --> 16:07.765
Do you have evidence of
Kocabash's treachery?

16:28.165 --> 16:29.632
We are with you, Ertugrul Bey!

16:32.365 --> 16:35.198
Long live Ertugrul!

16:38.632 --> 16:41.598
-Kill the murderer!
-We will not let you take our Bey!

16:51.865 --> 16:54.298
Kill Ertugrul!

17:16.765 --> 17:19.698
Death to Ertugrul!

17:41.132 --> 17:43.198
Beginning from the lands of our fathers,

17:44.532 --> 17:46.565
I have made our enemies
bow down to me.

17:48.398 --> 17:50.798
-And defeated countless traitors.
-He is right.

17:51.298 --> 17:56.865
My life has taught me the
nature of traitors.

17:59.532 --> 18:01.798
Now, I say to you

18:02.565 --> 18:08.198
Kocabash is personally responsible
from the death fo Atabey Ertokush.

18:10.265 --> 18:13.731
Kocabash tracked and
fed him to the Mongols.

18:14.465 --> 18:16.432
Just as he did with Tugtekin.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.432
How did Kocabash manage
to get back to the nomad tent,

18:23.332 --> 18:25.865
when countless Alps were
being slaughtered?

18:28.898 --> 18:34.465
How did Noyan the Merciless, released him?

18:37.398 --> 18:41.932
Noyan wanted to make me look guilty
by letting him live.

18:46.465 --> 18:52.665
He wanted the Beys of the two tribes
to turn against each other.

18:54.532 --> 18:58.432
He wanted to invade Anatolia

19:00.165 --> 19:02.498
while Kayis and Dodurgas
were at each other's throats.

19:09.932 --> 19:12.498
If only, our only traitor was Kocabash.

19:15.798 --> 19:18.565
Karabek, who is sitting beside me

19:18.932 --> 19:22.732
is the lapdog of that bastard Noyan!

19:27.698 --> 19:29.898
-This is treachery.
-Foul play!

19:30.198 --> 19:33.132
Insolence! Know your place!

19:33.665 --> 19:35.665
-This is impossible!
-What treachery is this?

19:42.632 --> 19:44.565
The dog who don't know how to bark

19:46.165 --> 19:48.598
will surely bring enemies
to the nomad group, gentlemen.

19:52.898 --> 19:58.798
This dog, allied with Noyan and
lay an ambush to the Oghuz tribe.

20:03.865 --> 20:06.198
When Noyan was nailing my hand

20:08.332 --> 20:10.332
he was watching with great pleasure.

20:11.165 --> 20:12.865
-This is treachery.
-Unacceptable!

20:18.132 --> 20:19.465
Is this true, Karabek?

20:28.532 --> 20:32.832
This scoundrel is trying to
get away with murder.

20:35.665 --> 20:40.232
This man has who has sold his
sword and tongue to the Devil...

20:42.265 --> 20:45.165
...is a murderer! And a traitor!

20:51.632 --> 20:57.232
He is trying to frame me
and provoke you against the State.

20:59.665 --> 21:01.265
His words are empty.

21:02.198 --> 21:03.665
I have a witness.

21:05.232 --> 21:06.798
Do I have your permission, Gumustekin?

21:11.865 --> 21:14.798
We will learn the truth today, Karabek.

21:16.365 --> 21:17.432
Let him come.

21:35.732 --> 21:39.198
Do you swear to tell the truth,
brave one?

21:39.532 --> 21:41.698
I swear to tell the truth.

21:44.265 --> 21:45.298
Sit.

21:54.765 --> 22:00.265
Ibrahim Yuglu,
is the steward of the late Ertokush Bey.

22:01.632 --> 22:05.665
He has been on the battlefield
constanly as a brave warrior.

22:06.632 --> 22:09.265
His father is an elite guard
of our Sultan.

22:10.765 --> 22:16.432
Now he will tell us
what has happended on the spot

22:16.765 --> 22:18.865
where Ertokush Bey
and his warriors were massacred

22:24.832 --> 22:27.732
-Traitors!
-It is I, Ertugrul Bey from Kayis.

22:27.865 --> 22:29.465
You are all murderers.

22:29.732 --> 22:32.298
Traitor! Traitors!

22:33.832 --> 22:35.765
You are all traitors!

22:37.632 --> 22:41.598
While my brothers were
being slaughtered one by one

22:42.132 --> 22:43.765
this man, Ertugrul showed.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.765
He was furious and I was alone.

22:47.498 --> 22:49.832
It was impossible for me to
take on so many men by myself.

22:50.632 --> 22:52.465
I had to flee with my horse.

22:53.332 --> 22:57.465
I swear on my life that,
this is all I have seen.

23:16.465 --> 23:18.398
You are right, my man. I also saw you.

23:20.465 --> 23:21.565
I was there.

23:22.298 --> 23:25.765
But everything was over
when I got there.

23:27.298 --> 23:31.132
I went there because
Atabey Ertokush wanted me to be there.

23:34.432 --> 23:36.132
You confessed.

23:36.865 --> 23:42.532
You can no longer play with words to
save your skin, Ertugrul.

23:48.265 --> 23:49.698
You were exiled, right?

23:51.532 --> 23:55.232
There is no way you could have seen
Ertokush Bey.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.132
Stop lying.

24:13.498 --> 24:14.598
Go to your place.

24:46.198 --> 24:48.365
I have never seen you like this, aunt.

24:49.898 --> 24:52.765
You are on the edge, ready to explode.

24:55.432 --> 25:00.465
I conquered this old mans bed,
for his marquee.

25:01.765 --> 25:05.298
It was still not enough,
so I took his bride away.

25:07.232 --> 25:10.332
I have been tolerating him for ages.

25:13.532 --> 25:14.598
And for what?

25:16.332 --> 25:20.432
For Oghuz's unity and strenght.

25:21.665 --> 25:24.365
I have tolerated him
for the sake of tribes

25:24.498 --> 25:27.698
living in Caspian and the Euphrates.

25:28.398 --> 25:30.732
I stood with my brother.

25:32.732 --> 25:36.532
For Gumustekin I would risk death.

25:38.232 --> 25:42.132
Just as you would, Goncagul.

25:44.398 --> 25:45.832
Tell me now.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.898
Is it really strange,
that I am on the edge?

25:52.332 --> 25:54.632
Is it really strange,
that my soul is on fire?

26:02.532 --> 26:07.132
Maybe Gundogdu was the man I have been
searching this whole time, aunt.

26:10.765 --> 26:16.198
Unlike you,
I would have laid with him happily.

26:18.732 --> 26:24.532
Not for my father. Not for you.
Only because I loved him.

26:28.932 --> 26:35.398
Unfortunately,
only a miracle can save us now, aunt.

27:03.732 --> 27:05.798
Our sufferings are great.

27:08.665 --> 27:11.365
But Gokce, my dear girl has a
deeper sorrow.

27:15.565 --> 27:19.465
They took her man away
before their wedding.

27:33.198 --> 27:35.765
We want justice for the dead Alps!

27:35.898 --> 27:37.898
-We want justice!
-Justice will be ours!

27:38.432 --> 27:40.698
-We want justice!
-They are framing our Bey!

27:44.365 --> 27:45.565
Everything is obvious.

27:48.465 --> 27:50.398
What more do you want to talk about?

27:51.898 --> 27:53.465
End this already!

27:55.565 --> 27:58.532
Swift justice is the best justice.

28:30.198 --> 28:34.532
The tribunal has come to a conclusion.

28:38.565 --> 28:40.832
Ertugrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

28:44.132 --> 28:47.298
For the crimes of laying an ambush
to the Ertokush Bey

28:47.632 --> 28:50.865
and the massacre of his men...

28:56.165 --> 29:00.932
...also laying an ambush to
the Tugtekin Bey of Dodurga Tribe

29:01.365 --> 29:04.265
...and massacring him...

29:10.598 --> 29:11.732
...and finally...

29:12.565 --> 29:15.232
...beheading the Alp...

29:17.165 --> 29:22.265
...as known as Kocabash...

29:23.465 --> 29:26.232
...who has survived the ambush...

29:41.665 --> 29:43.165
...you have been found guilty.

29:44.898 --> 29:47.365
-Ertugrul Bey is innocent!
-He is innocent!

29:47.765 --> 29:50.165
-What is the meaning of this!
-He is innocent!

29:50.932 --> 29:53.532
He is innocent!

29:54.332 --> 29:56.498
-Ertugrul Bey is innocent!
-Justice will be served!

29:56.732 --> 29:58.698
Don't do it, Ertugrul Bey is innocent!

30:00.598 --> 30:02.498
Silence! Enough!

30:13.232 --> 30:15.232
We have given our decision.

30:17.298 --> 30:21.898
Considering the two nomad groups'
deep sensibility

30:22.232 --> 30:26.598
the execution of punishment
will take place immediately.

30:26.798 --> 30:30.865
Sentence will be carried out
in front of the marquee.

30:31.165 --> 30:33.665
Execution will take place
in front of the people.

30:39.498 --> 30:44.398
As the custom dictates,
Korkut Bey will carry out the sentence

30:48.732 --> 30:51.798
and rightfully decapitate Ertugrul

30:54.865 --> 30:58.165
with his sword.

30:58.232 --> 31:00.498
No!

31:00.765 --> 31:02.832
Don't do this! Ertugrul Bey is innocent.

31:04.732 --> 31:08.598
Ertugrul Bey is telling the truth!

31:13.865 --> 31:15.432
You cannot do this.

31:17.365 --> 31:18.632
My son is innocent.

31:21.298 --> 31:22.598
My son is innocent!

31:30.932 --> 31:34.132
Is there something you wish to say
son of Suleyman Shah, Ertugrul?

31:37.932 --> 31:41.198
The truth belongs to God, Gumustekin.

31:48.765 --> 31:50.298
And about this devil here...

31:54.232 --> 31:56.565
Even if thousands of Husseins would perish

31:57.498 --> 32:00.398
the ones who follow Ali's path
would never yield.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.898
Take away the prisoner for execution.

32:22.165 --> 32:24.665
Don't do this! He is innocent.

32:26.832 --> 32:28.265
Our Bey is innocent.

32:36.265 --> 32:39.865
Long live Ertugrul!

33:14.832 --> 33:17.932
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

33:29.865 --> 33:31.232
Gumustekin Bey.

33:32.832 --> 33:35.165
Before the execution
I desire to say one last thing.

33:37.465 --> 33:38.632
Here you go, Gundogdu Bey.

33:39.398 --> 33:43.598
Have you informed Sultan Aleaddin
about this trial?

33:49.832 --> 33:53.432
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

34:03.932 --> 34:06.265
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

34:38.632 --> 34:41.132
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

34:53.732 --> 34:57.565
They are going to kill
Where are you Gundogdu?

35:00.765 --> 35:03.265
-Our Bey is not a murderer!
-No!

35:03.365 --> 35:06.598
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

35:12.498 --> 35:13.798
Sultan Aleaddin...

35:17.565 --> 35:19.898
...loves and respects Ertugrul deeply.

35:20.632 --> 35:25.632
If he hears about this,
we all will pay the price.

35:26.698 --> 35:28.532
We do not have time for this.

35:30.698 --> 35:32.898
Do you want to start a civil war,
Gundogdu Bey?

35:33.732 --> 35:35.498
As long as Ertugrul lives

35:35.598 --> 35:37.331
blood of the tribes will spill.

35:37.898 --> 35:41.232
Wild Demir and Halime Sultan
left for Konya

35:41.398 --> 35:45.365
to inform the Sultan Aleaddin
about the matter.

35:50.798 --> 35:54.432
You finally remembered that
your daughter in law is royalty.

35:55.765 --> 35:57.365
Are you use this as leverage?

35:57.698 --> 36:03.165
As long as you cannot provide justice,
I will do as I wish, Korkut Bey!

36:03.898 --> 36:05.198
It is over!

36:19.165 --> 36:21.832
Ertugrul is a murderer!
He will be killed. That is all.

36:23.665 --> 36:26.865
You are blinded by hate and vengeance!

36:27.432 --> 36:30.132
You all will pay the price! We all will!

36:34.832 --> 36:36.198
Hayme Hatun.

36:37.832 --> 36:39.265
Gundogdu Bey.

36:40.598 --> 36:43.265
I am also deeply saddened by the events.

36:43.932 --> 36:45.565
Kocabash's death is obvious.

36:46.532 --> 36:51.465
After hearing the witness,
my hands are tied.

36:53.598 --> 36:55.498
I will not wait any longer.

37:01.465 --> 37:05.265
When Ertugrul was born,
you were the first to hold him.

37:06.698 --> 37:08.798
When his father returned
from the war, injured

37:09.198 --> 37:10.732
you took him to his father.

37:12.198 --> 37:16.765
Ertugrul is innocent
as the day he was born.

37:17.932 --> 37:19.298
Don't do this.

37:26.832 --> 37:29.598
Long live Ertugrul!

37:48.298 --> 37:50.665
Long live Ertugrul!

37:54.898 --> 37:57.465
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

38:06.832 --> 38:09.198
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

38:27.698 --> 38:29.665
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

38:35.165 --> 38:38.165
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

38:44.498 --> 38:48.132
He murdered my son!
His death is my right!

38:48.932 --> 38:50.432
And I will claim that right!

38:51.698 --> 38:52.732
Korkut!

38:54.298 --> 38:55.398
Mother.

39:00.165 --> 39:02.832
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

39:36.265 --> 39:38.432
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

39:41.298 --> 39:43.265
You are making a mistake, uncle.

39:44.832 --> 39:46.332
Save your breath.

39:46.898 --> 39:51.165
If you still have some faith
recite the Shadada.

39:53.532 --> 39:55.798
I bear witness, there is no deity
worthy to be worshipped but God,

39:56.332 --> 39:59.498
and I bear witness Mohammad is
his servant and his messenger.

40:07.398 --> 40:10.398
I am well, son.
Go and do what is necessary.

40:12.132 --> 40:13.232
Just go.

40:13.298 --> 40:15.565
Do not worry Mother. Wait here.

40:15.932 --> 40:18.332
-I will speak their language.
-Alright.

41:36.132 --> 41:37.565
Halime.

41:56.398 --> 41:58.832
Both Mother Hayme and
Gundogdu are not around.

41:59.332 --> 42:01.532
It is obvious, they are
keeping them inside.

42:18.565 --> 42:20.632
<i>Help us God.</i>

42:23.332 --> 42:26.698
Dogan. Bamsi. Turgut.

42:27.765 --> 42:29.532
It is time for battle.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.332
Defend Ertugrul, my warriors.

42:49.698 --> 42:50.932
Run!

43:01.732 --> 43:03.698
Dumrul!

43:03.798 --> 43:06.165
In the name of God!

43:13.265 --> 43:14.565
Go, Alps!

43:41.865 --> 43:43.365
For God!

43:57.698 --> 44:01.265
-Mother.
-Go, save your brother. Run!

44:01.898 --> 44:03.332
Go on, son.

45:14.665 --> 45:16.798
Nobody move!

48:35.351 --> 48:37.485
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

48:38.285 --> 48:39.418
And peace be upon you.

48:41.451 --> 48:42.785
And peace be upon you.

48:44.318 --> 48:45.351
Our Bey is alive!

48:45.718 --> 48:47.718
This brave warrior has healed.

48:48.751 --> 48:50.818
I have come to deliver him to his father.

48:58.385 --> 49:00.685
Tugtekin! My son!

49:02.118 --> 49:03.185
My son.

49:04.818 --> 49:06.718
-My son.
-Father.

49:18.851 --> 49:20.251
Lower your swords.

49:34.285 --> 49:35.451
Father.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.951
Who have done this to you, son?

49:51.785 --> 49:53.151
Who did this?

50:01.285 --> 50:03.018
The sole responsible...

50:05.251 --> 50:06.885
...for all of this is...

50:09.885 --> 50:10.885
Tell me.

50:25.085 --> 50:26.151
What?

50:27.885 --> 50:29.185
Ertugrul.

51:36.185 --> 51:39.218
The sole responsible for this sorrow...

51:41.051 --> 51:42.251
...is Ertugrul, father.

51:51.351 --> 51:52.985
He has ruined...

51:55.718 --> 51:57.751
...the nomad groups with
his vanity and stubbornness.

52:05.018 --> 52:06.718
He gave Mongols...

52:09.251 --> 52:11.151
...the chance to attack us...

52:14.318 --> 52:20.351
...and defeat us from within.

52:26.385 --> 52:28.051
Let everyone know that...

52:32.985 --> 52:34.985
...the one who did this to me...

52:38.385 --> 52:40.751
...the one who massacred our Alps...

52:44.151 --> 52:46.751
...and Seljuk warriors...

52:50.918 --> 52:53.351
...and the one who murdered
Ertokush Bey...

53:00.151 --> 53:01.251
...is not Ertugrul.

53:05.751 --> 53:07.918
Justice is served!

53:10.185 --> 53:11.251
Our Bey is innocent!

53:16.485 --> 53:18.118
Long live, Ertugrul Bey!

53:23.751 --> 53:25.318
Thank God.

53:46.118 --> 53:49.451
Ertugrul is a complete pain in the ass.

53:55.451 --> 53:57.885
But he is no traitor, father.

54:08.018 --> 54:09.118
Bey, Karabek is gone!

54:14.185 --> 54:16.285
Horses! Get to the horses!

54:37.885 --> 54:39.051
Thank you.

55:14.918 --> 55:15.918
Bey!

55:17.685 --> 55:19.118
We will take care of Karabek.

55:20.185 --> 55:22.851
Please, stay with Mother Hayme.

55:24.018 --> 55:25.485
Do not worry, Bey.

55:30.818 --> 55:33.051
I will not, as long as you are by my side.

55:36.685 --> 55:38.485
-May you conquer all.
-Thank you, Bey.

56:24.951 --> 56:28.351
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

56:28.951 --> 56:33.085
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

56:33.951 --> 56:39.951
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

57:04.751 --> 57:07.485
Brothers. Sisters.

57:09.218 --> 57:11.018
Brave Alps of my nomad group.

57:12.885 --> 57:17.785
Thank God, we are freed from
that bastard Noyan's treachery.

57:19.685 --> 57:20.918
Thank God.

57:22.185 --> 57:25.085
However, this malevolent...

57:26.118 --> 57:29.318
...and treacherous war has just begun.

57:30.818 --> 57:34.918
We have been betrayed
by our sons, brothers...

57:35.485 --> 57:38.351
...as we have been for 1000 years.

57:40.851 --> 57:45.885
The war will not be over
until wipe all of them out.

57:47.251 --> 57:49.951
But, neither Noyan

57:51.051 --> 57:55.451
nor the traitors within us
will be unpunished.

57:58.185 --> 58:01.385
They will pay the price.

58:01.951 --> 58:05.218
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

58:07.018 --> 58:11.385
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

58:27.118 --> 58:30.985
We are the glorious descendants of Oghuz.

58:33.318 --> 58:36.851
Justice and liberty is in our blood!

58:37.385 --> 58:39.885
We will live and die this way!

58:46.885 --> 58:51.018
Justice, until the end!
Liberty, until the end!

58:51.385 --> 58:57.051
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

59:02.685 --> 59:08.151
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

59:18.485 --> 59:24.118
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

59:54.751 --> 59:57.251
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:05.918
Go on! Move you bloody animal.

01:00:07.351 --> 01:00:08.418
Move!

01:01:18.751 --> 01:01:21.085
Come here boy. Where will you go?

01:01:25.118 --> 01:01:27.051
We will have a little chat.

01:01:27.285 --> 01:01:29.918
Then I will beat you to a pulp.

01:01:32.051 --> 01:01:33.818
Leave some for us, brother Bamsi.

01:01:33.951 --> 01:01:36.718
We will have equal shares of this
Mongol bastard. Do not worry.

01:01:45.485 --> 01:01:46.685
In the name of God!

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:36.285
Brother!

01:02:36.685 --> 01:02:38.985
Brother!

01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:34.251
What happened?

01:03:35.951 --> 01:03:37.118
Ertugrul...

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:42.485
...was saved from execution.

01:03:43.018 --> 01:03:44.685
What do you mean he was saved?

01:03:45.418 --> 01:03:49.085
What do you mean he was saved?

01:03:51.051 --> 01:03:53.785
Tugtekin returned to the nomad tent.

01:03:54.685 --> 01:03:57.085
He told them everything, Noyan.
Everything.

01:04:44.785 --> 01:04:46.318
Ertugrul!

01:05:05.718 --> 01:05:06.851
Gather the men! We are leaving!

01:05:07.918 --> 01:05:08.985
Take him.

01:05:57.985 --> 01:05:59.118
Brother.

01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:03.285
Are you alright, brother? Tell me.

01:06:04.785 --> 01:06:08.451
A mosquito bite in the dead of winter.
What are the odds?

01:06:10.285 --> 01:06:12.985
I wish there were more of them
for us to crush, brother.

01:06:13.218 --> 01:06:15.818
I doubt we can finish them all like that.
Let's go after Karabek.

01:06:15.885 --> 01:06:16.885
Come on.

01:06:38.785 --> 01:06:39.851
My son.

01:06:41.085 --> 01:06:42.085
Father.

01:06:43.351 --> 01:06:45.318
What have I done to be
condemned to hell...

01:06:46.885 --> 01:06:50.418
...while I was still drawing breath, God?

01:06:54.485 --> 01:06:59.485
After all the children I have lost,
God made me suffer for you too.

01:07:01.318 --> 01:07:05.185
I am back, father. Look, I am fine.
Do not worry.

01:07:08.685 --> 01:07:10.285
If something had happened to you too...

01:07:12.718 --> 01:07:14.685
...how would I endure your torment?

01:07:17.485 --> 01:07:22.318
Death has claimed all of my children,
like a thirsty desert.

01:07:24.418 --> 01:07:25.885
And now you.

01:07:29.185 --> 01:07:31.985
Ertugrul was right about
everything he said, my son.

01:07:34.085 --> 01:07:38.051
I despised his courage and intelligence.

01:07:40.918 --> 01:07:42.351
May God forgive me.

01:07:48.685 --> 01:07:49.918
Did my Alps...

01:07:51.251 --> 01:07:53.851
...Bogac and Samsa come back?

01:07:56.685 --> 01:08:00.118
We could not find any evidence
whether they were alive or not.

01:08:03.285 --> 01:08:05.351
They are my blood brothers.

01:08:10.151 --> 01:08:11.485
If Noyan...

01:08:14.085 --> 01:08:15.818
...killed them...

01:08:18.685 --> 01:08:20.451
...I will kill him with my own hands.

01:08:21.451 --> 01:08:26.685
Get well, brave one.
Then you can slay that bastard.

01:08:59.251 --> 01:09:02.285
Horseshoe tracks.
They took the carriage and left.

01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:06.485
There is blood.

01:09:08.685 --> 01:09:10.218
What should we tell our Bey?

01:09:59.785 --> 01:10:01.418
I am glad it is over, son.

01:10:01.718 --> 01:10:02.918
Thank you, mother.

01:10:10.718 --> 01:10:12.251
It is over, brother.

01:10:12.351 --> 01:10:13.485
Thank you, brother.

01:10:14.151 --> 01:10:15.818
I am glad it is over, Ertugrul Bey.

01:10:16.018 --> 01:10:18.951
Selcan Hatun, brother.

01:10:20.385 --> 01:10:22.751
I am safe thanks to you.

01:10:25.318 --> 01:10:27.051
May I come in, Sister Halime?

01:10:27.385 --> 01:10:28.918
You may, Korkut Bey.

01:10:32.951 --> 01:10:34.385
You honor our marquee.

01:10:49.185 --> 01:10:51.385
Will you be able to forgive me, Ertugrul?

01:10:53.318 --> 01:10:55.018
The war is at our doorstep, uncle.

01:10:56.351 --> 01:10:58.851
Thousands of Turkmens are
being murdered every day.

01:10:59.485 --> 01:11:02.351
Ogedai's army is getting closer to
Anatolia step by step.

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:06.285
We do not have the right
to be angry with each other

01:11:06.485 --> 01:11:08.418
in this situation.

01:11:09.851 --> 01:11:11.485
Know this, as long as you are just,

01:11:11.818 --> 01:11:14.418
I will have your back
until my last breath.

01:11:16.685 --> 01:11:19.385
Thank you, nephew.

01:11:26.785 --> 01:11:30.818
What about you, Sister Hayme?
Will you be able to forgive me?

01:11:32.785 --> 01:11:34.685
Everything is over, brother.

01:11:37.018 --> 01:11:41.051
It was not us, but our enemy
who has put us in this state.

01:11:41.785 --> 01:11:45.318
From now on we will not give
our enemy this chance.

01:12:21.218 --> 01:12:22.318
Brother!

01:12:23.985 --> 01:12:26.218
What is happening? What is wrong with you?

01:12:26.851 --> 01:12:31.451
Ertugrul came in our way again when
we were getting close to our goal.

01:12:35.718 --> 01:12:38.485
Did you think becoming a Bey
would be easy?

01:12:38.918 --> 01:12:41.818
There will be countless traps and
ambushes waiting for you.

01:12:42.051 --> 01:12:45.918
You will lose first so that victory
will be more sweet.

01:12:48.918 --> 01:12:52.751
If Sultan Aleaddin hears
his accomplishments

01:12:53.385 --> 01:12:55.818
my margrave will only be a dream.

01:12:58.318 --> 01:13:00.285
I have to show my teeth.

01:13:00.785 --> 01:13:05.251
Brother, it is time to act wisely.

01:13:06.451 --> 01:13:09.785
Ertugrul became a hero
in Korkut and tribe's eyes.

01:13:11.051 --> 01:13:13.385
You have to be a greater hero
than he is...

01:13:14.785 --> 01:13:17.985
...or act against him.

01:13:31.885 --> 01:13:33.885
Easy, Bey.

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.351
You take these.

01:13:48.285 --> 01:13:50.918
Do not worry, Bey.
God will help you heal.

01:13:51.818 --> 01:13:54.085
-May God bless you.
-Thank you.

01:14:05.385 --> 01:14:06.718
Bey.

01:14:08.018 --> 01:14:09.118
Do not move.

01:14:10.851 --> 01:14:12.351
Your wounds are still fresh.

01:14:24.885 --> 01:14:26.685
I am responsible for all of this.

01:14:29.451 --> 01:14:31.418
I should not have told you
Ertugrul's location.

01:14:38.218 --> 01:14:39.951
Do not blame yourself.

01:14:43.785 --> 01:14:45.351
We both know that...

01:14:48.118 --> 01:14:52.285
...Ertugrul is the only one responsible
for the things that happened to me...

01:14:53.185 --> 01:14:55.218
...and this tribe.

01:15:00.718 --> 01:15:01.885
You may seek revenge...

01:15:03.185 --> 01:15:06.418
When you are healed and back on your duty.

01:15:10.851 --> 01:15:13.085
I will not leave your side
until you recover.

01:15:15.885 --> 01:15:19.251
We will all be fine when you get better.

01:15:20.685 --> 01:15:21.785
Thank you.

01:15:36.285 --> 01:15:37.418
Permission to enter, Bey?

01:15:39.418 --> 01:15:40.451
Come in, Alps.

01:15:46.318 --> 01:15:47.451
Bey.

01:15:50.185 --> 01:15:53.385
Mongols caught us and
they took Karabek from our grasp.

01:16:00.218 --> 01:16:01.418
Tell me what happened.

01:16:02.885 --> 01:16:04.951
There were traces of blood
where they took him, Bey.

01:16:07.351 --> 01:16:10.018
Noyan. He is the only one
who is capable of doing this.

01:16:12.051 --> 01:16:14.918
I think he came close to the nomad tent
to watch my execution.

01:16:17.685 --> 01:16:19.285
Then he took his dog and left.

01:16:22.251 --> 01:16:25.985
-What are we going to do, Bey?
-It is time to attack, Alps.

01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:31.118
Did you hear that, brother Dogan?
We will trample them!

01:16:34.718 --> 01:16:35.918
As you command, Bey!

01:17:00.818 --> 01:17:03.851
<i>To those who raise and demolish states.</i>

01:17:05.318 --> 01:17:08.418
<i>Greetings from Vazifeli Artuk.</i>

01:17:12.251 --> 01:17:15.085
<i>Ertugrul Bey has overcome</i>
 <i>all of the traps laid out for him.</i>

01:17:16.685 --> 01:17:18.318
<i>He defeated all of his enemies.</i>

01:17:20.451 --> 01:17:25.185
<i>With your permission, I would like to</i>
 <i>bring him to Ahlat to see you.</i>

01:17:57.851 --> 01:17:59.118
What happened, Bamsi?

01:18:00.085 --> 01:18:01.451
You look overjoyed.

01:18:03.185 --> 01:18:04.351
That is true, Bey.

01:18:04.451 --> 01:18:07.051
I would be like this all the time
if I could kill heretics every day.

01:18:11.985 --> 01:18:13.485
May God make your joy everlasting,
brother.

01:18:13.718 --> 01:18:14.818
Thank you, Bey.

01:18:22.418 --> 01:18:24.118
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:18:24.218 --> 01:18:25.218
And peace be upon you.

01:18:29.318 --> 01:18:30.318
Welcome.

01:18:32.318 --> 01:18:35.218
-You honor our marquee.
-Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

01:18:37.851 --> 01:18:40.018
How are you brave warriors?

01:18:40.851 --> 01:18:42.951
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:18:44.851 --> 01:18:47.385
What advise will you give us tonight, sir?

01:18:53.185 --> 01:18:58.051
The conquers that have been heralded
will come true one by one.

01:19:00.885 --> 01:19:02.718
God's promise is near.

01:19:03.451 --> 01:19:06.751
The world will get to know this conquest.

01:19:08.351 --> 01:19:11.418
The joyous conquest we have been
waiting for is near.

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:20.785
God's loved one, our master

01:19:21.685 --> 01:19:26.718
was exiled from Mecca where
he was born and loved very much.

01:19:27.985 --> 01:19:34.985
In a midnight, Habibullah
ran away from Mecca in tears.

01:19:36.851 --> 01:19:41.418
In the eight year of his hejira,
he returned to Mecca as a

01:19:41.718 --> 01:19:46.318
commander of the conquest
that God promised him.

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:51.951
Our master left Mecca with only
one person beside him

01:19:52.118 --> 01:19:56.685
but he returned there with thousands.

01:19:57.385 --> 01:20:02.818
Not proudly as a conquerer
but with all his modesty.

01:20:04.718 --> 01:20:08.385
He put his head against
his camel like he was groveling.

01:20:08.485 --> 01:20:10.385
He was praying to God.

01:20:11.451 --> 01:20:16.018
God's messenger did not attribute
this conquest to himself.

01:20:17.218 --> 01:20:22.851
He walked in Mecca's streets modestly,
being thankful to God.

01:20:23.951 --> 01:20:28.418
He ordered: "He who enters
Ebu Sufyan's home would be safe.

01:20:29.085 --> 01:20:32.418
He who leaves their weapon and
enters his house, is safe.

01:20:34.018 --> 01:20:36.185
He who takes refuge in Kaaba is safe."

01:20:37.151 --> 01:20:42.185
Mecca was conquered once again
with people's morals and benediction.

01:20:45.285 --> 01:20:49.951
Mecca was taken without bloodshed
and a bairam of forgiveness was declared.

01:20:51.951 --> 01:20:58.385
Our master declared that he forgave
the savage who killed his uncle,

01:20:59.151 --> 01:21:03.418
Ebu Sufyan's wife and all of his enemies.

01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:11.085
He showed everyone the moral of
being victorious by his doings.

01:21:12.918 --> 01:21:17.051
All conquerers must take guidance
from his actions.

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:32.051
Why he did not kill his enemies?

01:21:35.318 --> 01:21:40.218
Son, he was sent to keep us alive,
not kill us.

01:21:42.051 --> 01:21:46.918
He is the servant
and the messenger of God,

01:21:47.485 --> 01:21:49.218
who is compassionate and merciful, my boy.

01:21:49.385 --> 01:21:50.485
I agree.

01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:20.485
May I come in, my Bey?

01:22:21.251 --> 01:22:22.318
Come in, Gokce.

01:22:25.818 --> 01:22:27.018
Good night.

01:22:33.318 --> 01:22:35.285
I came to ask if you need something.

01:22:41.785 --> 01:22:43.885
I want nothing now that you are here.

01:22:48.085 --> 01:22:50.018
Despite everything I've been through...

01:22:51.318 --> 01:22:53.418
...all my troubles fade away
when I see you.

01:22:54.818 --> 01:22:55.951
That is enough for me.

01:22:59.285 --> 01:23:02.085
Will you be able to say these
when Ertugrul is in nomad tent?

01:23:06.318 --> 01:23:08.718
There is no peace where
Ertugrul is, Gokce.

01:23:11.351 --> 01:23:14.985
Ertugrul is in good spirits because
he humiliated me in front of my Alps.

01:23:15.818 --> 01:23:16.918
May I come in?

01:23:19.118 --> 01:23:21.851
-Samsa?
-It is us, my Bey. May we come in?

01:23:23.718 --> 01:23:25.885
-Yes, come in.
-Slowly.

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:44.151
You are alive.

01:23:44.818 --> 01:23:45.818
Bey.

01:23:48.485 --> 01:23:49.818
If I may.

01:23:53.318 --> 01:23:55.951
-How did you survive?
-We were both gravely injured, Bey.

01:23:56.285 --> 01:23:59.685
I passed out. When I opened my eyes,
I found myself in a village.

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:01.118
And there I saw Samsa.

01:24:02.318 --> 01:24:04.851
He found me, and took me to the village.

01:24:06.718 --> 01:24:08.751
We stayed in that village
until we were healed.

01:24:08.918 --> 01:24:10.918
Then we found two horses and
came back to nomad tent.

01:24:11.718 --> 01:24:14.485
We heard what happened to that
bastard Kocabash, Bey.

01:24:15.285 --> 01:24:16.751
He got what he deserved.

01:25:24.751 --> 01:25:26.385
Give me good news, Tangut.

01:26:00.118 --> 01:26:03.418
You finally proved
you are my most trusted man.

01:26:06.385 --> 01:26:09.151
You brought back what
Sungurtekin took from us.

01:26:10.685 --> 01:26:12.185
However, Sungurtekin...

01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:22.718
...is going to Konya, Noyan.

01:26:23.685 --> 01:26:25.885
He is with Halime Sultan and that smith.

01:27:20.676 --> 01:27:22.142
We gave Noyan's game away.

01:27:24.542 --> 01:27:28.109
He will get more aggressive now.
We will not reprieve him anymore.

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:31.809
We will not stop until he plagues.

01:27:32.809 --> 01:27:34.609
-We are with you with God's help, Bey.
-Thank you, Bey.

01:27:35.076 --> 01:27:37.842
We can go right now. We can spend the day
by killing non-Muslims.

01:27:43.609 --> 01:27:44.609
Alps!

01:27:45.876 --> 01:27:48.476
For Ertugrul Bey! Be ready!

01:28:01.609 --> 01:28:05.109
Bey, when will we take our seignior back?

01:28:07.409 --> 01:28:09.276
Who can take our seignior, Dogan?

01:28:11.242 --> 01:28:14.109
We born as Alp and will die as Alp also
with God's help.

01:28:15.242 --> 01:28:16.409
Is there any other side of it?

01:28:18.876 --> 01:28:22.176
When we will take our seignior
from that Tugtekin, Bey.

01:28:23.076 --> 01:28:25.309
When will we take our seignior from,
Tugtekin Bey?

01:28:26.742 --> 01:28:28.509
That is taken by legislature is also
given by legislature, Bamsi.

01:28:30.109 --> 01:28:31.509
Beyond that it does not suit us.

01:28:33.576 --> 01:28:35.242
Everything has a time, of course.

01:28:36.642 --> 01:28:37.709
Thank you, Bey.

01:28:44.809 --> 01:28:46.242
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:28:46.842 --> 01:28:48.342
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:50.176
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:28:50.475 --> 01:28:51.876
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:28:52.409 --> 01:28:53.642
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:28:54.176 --> 01:28:55.509
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:57.409
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:28:57.742 --> 01:28:59.176
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:28:59.642 --> 01:29:01.176
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:01.576 --> 01:29:02.876
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:03.409 --> 01:29:04.776
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:05.242 --> 01:29:06.642
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:07.076 --> 01:29:08.442
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:08.809 --> 01:29:10.309
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:11.376 --> 01:29:12.676
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:13.276 --> 01:29:14.609
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:15.442 --> 01:29:16.809
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:20.842 --> 01:29:22.509
Long live you too, valiant men!

01:29:23.642 --> 01:29:25.376
You never left me alone!

01:29:26.476 --> 01:29:31.776
You believed me without hesitation
when all the traitors inside

01:29:33.176 --> 01:29:34.709
and outside defamed me!

01:29:36.409 --> 01:29:37.642
You long live!

01:29:39.242 --> 01:29:43.076
Do not leave the laws of Oghuz
or our religion!

01:29:44.776 --> 01:29:45.776
Long live.

01:29:46.209 --> 01:29:47.342
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:47.576 --> 01:29:49.076
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:49.409 --> 01:29:50.776
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:51.276 --> 01:29:52.576
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:53.176 --> 01:29:54.476
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:54.876 --> 01:29:56.342
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:56.742 --> 01:29:58.242
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:29:58.509 --> 01:29:59.876
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:30:00.376 --> 01:30:01.742
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:03.542
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:30:04.076 --> 01:30:05.409
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:30:05.776 --> 01:30:07.242
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:30:07.576 --> 01:30:09.076
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:30:09.442 --> 01:30:10.776
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:30:11.276 --> 01:30:12.576
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:30:16.876 --> 01:30:18.642
Do you understand me, fool man?

01:30:20.876 --> 01:30:22.742
Sungurtekin and Halime Sultan

01:30:23.576 --> 01:30:26.109
will never confront Alaeddin.

01:30:27.376 --> 01:30:29.242
You will go to the palace

01:30:30.442 --> 01:30:33.709
and prepare your game.

01:30:36.676 --> 01:30:38.642
You will be on your way to Konya
early in the morning.

01:30:40.276 --> 01:30:42.709
Tangut will come with you
so that nothing happens to you.

01:30:44.442 --> 01:30:46.209
If you do not do what I said

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:51.476
I will come to Konya and kill you
with my own hands. Know it.

01:30:59.409 --> 01:31:00.409
Get out of my sight now!

01:31:13.209 --> 01:31:16.776
Noyan, should I take Abdurrahman
and Hamza with me?

01:31:17.276 --> 01:31:18.442
They will stay here.

01:32:25.142 --> 01:32:26.276
Peace be upon you.

01:32:27.742 --> 01:32:29.742
-And peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:32:31.376 --> 01:32:33.076
-May God be with you.
-Thank you.

01:32:34.142 --> 01:32:35.642
It is time to get going for me, son.

01:32:36.776 --> 01:32:39.509
I do not know how I could handle with
all these if you would not be with me.

01:32:40.142 --> 01:32:44.442
When a man decided to be Moses,
God sends him a help.

01:32:46.309 --> 01:32:49.709
Servants are only a reason.
You need to know who send them.

01:32:51.142 --> 01:32:52.209
Thank you.

01:32:53.609 --> 01:32:56.476
I go but I entrust my dervish to you.

01:32:59.509 --> 01:33:02.476
It would be good if you gave him a task
in the mosque of nomad tent.

01:33:02.642 --> 01:33:05.409
He educates the children.
-Do not worry.

01:33:05.875 --> 01:33:07.076
Thank you.

01:33:15.342 --> 01:33:18.242
Dervish, children are seeds.

01:33:19.142 --> 01:33:23.176
If you feed them well and grow them well,
you get good harvest.

01:33:23.576 --> 01:33:24.642
Do not forget that.

01:33:24.809 --> 01:33:28.542
You gave this blessed task to me,
may God bless you.

01:33:29.509 --> 01:33:30.809
I will protect my consignation.

01:33:41.142 --> 01:33:42.142
If you excuse me.

01:33:43.242 --> 01:33:44.442
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

01:34:31.842 --> 01:34:34.709
You destroyed the blessed army
of Ogeday in this land.

01:34:38.609 --> 01:34:40.542
You killed your own soldiers.

01:34:43.476 --> 01:34:47.676
Loss suits you now, not the victory.

01:34:52.276 --> 01:34:57.442
Until you lose your commandership task
I will fight with you, Noyan.

01:35:41.776 --> 01:35:45.142
Are you happy to be with Noyan
by selling out your marquee, Abdurrahman?

01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:53.209
I did not sell out anyone.

01:35:56.576 --> 01:36:00.509
I am here only to rise
in Ogeday's blessed army.

01:36:03.409 --> 01:36:04.809
He sends us to death every day.

01:36:08.076 --> 01:36:10.076
We live with death like it's our shadow.

01:36:13.676 --> 01:36:15.542
It is good if we fail and die.

01:36:17.176 --> 01:36:21.309
But if we return here,
we will regret why we are not dead.

01:36:25.376 --> 01:36:27.376
You have so much suffering, Tangut.

01:36:32.242 --> 01:36:34.276
He will send Karabek to Konya tomorrow.

01:36:36.409 --> 01:36:40.676
He wants to kill Halime Sultan
before she fronts Alaeddin in the palace.

01:36:44.676 --> 01:36:46.242
If things go wrong

01:36:47.376 --> 01:36:49.442
he will kill me without showing mercy.

01:36:53.442 --> 01:36:57.309
So put it this way, I am tired.

01:37:00.542 --> 01:37:01.642
I am very tired.

01:37:14.509 --> 01:37:15.509
Anyway.

01:37:22.542 --> 01:37:24.676
Let us see how long you will resist
to this torture.

01:37:26.309 --> 01:37:28.576
There is no other way than to die, Tangut.

01:37:30.176 --> 01:37:31.842
And we are not afraid of it
with God's help.

01:37:41.376 --> 01:37:43.376
You will give me Ertugrul, Abdurrahman.

01:37:43.709 --> 01:37:45.609
I will take him one way or the other.

01:38:13.709 --> 01:38:17.542
You are right but what if Tugtekin
do not accept this decision?

01:38:20.509 --> 01:38:24.176
One way or another, this will be
the best for all of us, brother.

01:38:25.842 --> 01:38:29.409
At least, we were stabbed in the back
to learn how to go in our own way.

01:38:33.742 --> 01:38:34.776
You are right.

01:38:39.276 --> 01:38:40.609
My brother is right, mother.

01:38:41.876 --> 01:38:44.842
This should be end in this headquarter.

01:38:48.842 --> 01:38:49.876
All right, son.

01:38:51.376 --> 01:38:54.242
But how can you fight with Noyan alone?

01:38:59.176 --> 01:39:03.309
There is Dogan. Turgut Bamsi.

01:39:04.609 --> 01:39:06.876
There is Geyikli. Abdurrahman.

01:39:34.276 --> 01:39:35.409
Meeting is starting.

01:39:37.309 --> 01:39:41.309
I am sure that Ertugrul
will cause us trouble.

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:43.542
You are like captivated.

01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:45.476
One of your words is Ertugrul.

01:39:46.342 --> 01:39:48.442
If we do not take precaution
next will be us, brother.

01:39:51.142 --> 01:39:52.142
Not so fast.

01:39:55.409 --> 01:39:56.876
I have not played my game yet.

01:40:00.476 --> 01:40:02.709
I trained people like Ertugrul
in the palace in Konya.

01:40:06.876 --> 01:40:09.376
Let him live the happiness of his victory.

01:40:10.309 --> 01:40:12.842
Ertugrul is much smarter
than you think, brother.

01:40:17.342 --> 01:40:19.409
I will send Tugtekin to fight with him.

01:40:20.142 --> 01:40:21.576
They will play like a child.

01:40:22.176 --> 01:40:23.809
Then we will see his intelligence.

01:40:24.342 --> 01:40:26.176
What if he learns what we did?

01:40:26.842 --> 01:40:29.176
What if he reveals us like Kocabash?

01:40:36.576 --> 01:40:38.276
He will not live so long.

01:40:46.742 --> 01:40:48.609
Why did you want to see me here, Noyan?

01:40:53.276 --> 01:40:54.676
Let us say that, it is safer.

01:40:57.676 --> 01:41:01.242
Kayis and Dodurgians
had almost a civil war.

01:41:02.576 --> 01:41:03.609
I know that, Noyan.

01:41:05.309 --> 01:41:10.342
We have to ask the accounts for these
before winter ends and war begins.

01:41:11.876 --> 01:41:14.076
We can handle this together, Noyan.

01:41:16.176 --> 01:41:17.309
I know.

01:41:17.642 --> 01:41:20.609
They will stand in front of the Mongolian
army as Tengri mountain.

01:41:21.842 --> 01:41:23.876
They cannot defeat Ogeday's army.

01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:26.809
But they will cause so much suffering.

01:41:28.509 --> 01:41:32.242
They will harm us until our army
comes to Konya.

01:41:33.609 --> 01:41:35.242
What do you want from me, Noyan?

01:41:39.076 --> 01:41:41.242
Did you bring the gold that
Gundogdu asked for?

01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:43.809
I brought.

01:41:44.675 --> 01:41:45.809
Good.

01:41:46.409 --> 01:41:49.809
When you go to take the herd and goods
you will not take the gold with you.

01:41:50.276 --> 01:41:53.142
-Noyan, our deal is to give the golds...
-Do what I say.

01:41:54.076 --> 01:41:57.076
You will say that golds are on the way
and come from Erzurum.

01:41:58.142 --> 01:41:59.776
There is something I want you to do

01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:03.309
while you are waiting for the golds
in the nomad tent.

01:42:44.076 --> 01:42:46.109
-Goncagul Hatun.
-Gundogdu Bey.

01:42:46.876 --> 01:42:48.709
-More power to you.
-Thank you.

01:42:50.676 --> 01:42:52.476
What a lucky man your father is.

01:42:53.609 --> 01:42:56.376
You get fresh herbs
for his foot every day.

01:42:57.642 --> 01:43:01.509
Actually, I am lucky to have
a father, Gundogdu Bey.

01:43:03.542 --> 01:43:07.076
The man who will marry you will be
at least as lucky as your father.

01:43:10.076 --> 01:43:14.442
If I see a valiant man as you say
and if he can see the beauty inside

01:43:15.442 --> 01:43:19.276
then it is my duty to marry him
and give him children, Gundogdu Bey.

01:43:22.509 --> 01:43:26.176
Then it is time to say to you
what is in my heart.

01:43:29.609 --> 01:43:30.876
Let your heart speak.

01:43:34.876 --> 01:43:36.142
Goncagul Hatun.

01:43:37.676 --> 01:43:41.476
I want to spend a lifetime with you

01:43:42.742 --> 01:43:44.376
and hopefully with my children.

01:43:46.509 --> 01:43:48.442
How beautiful your heart
speaks, Gundogdu Bey.

01:44:39.142 --> 01:44:40.142
My Bey!

01:44:42.509 --> 01:44:43.842
Your scars are not healed yet.

01:44:50.376 --> 01:44:51.742
Where are you going in this condition?

01:44:55.809 --> 01:44:57.509
Ertugrul will not stay not doing
anything in the headquarter.

01:45:01.142 --> 01:45:04.742
If you go there so bad,
you will make Ertugrul's job easier.

01:45:06.076 --> 01:45:09.076
Headquarter took the head of seignior
from Ertugrul because he was one-armed.

01:45:10.242 --> 01:45:11.809
You are also in the same situation now.

01:45:14.109 --> 01:45:17.476
If you join to headquarter,
Ertugrul will use this.

01:45:20.876 --> 01:45:22.809
I will join to headquarter
whatever happens, Gokce.

01:45:27.176 --> 01:45:29.576
If Ertugrul thinks that he can convince
the whole headquarter

01:45:30.176 --> 01:45:31.809
including my father, he is wrong.

01:45:36.242 --> 01:45:37.476
He will see that I am not alone.

01:46:18.542 --> 01:46:20.109
I hope nothing is wrong
Abdurrahman brother?

01:46:20.442 --> 01:46:22.876
There is no time to lose Geyikli brother.

01:46:23.542 --> 01:46:25.709
You should immediately go to the
nomad tent, to Ertugrul.

01:46:26.609 --> 01:46:30.242
Halime Sultan and Sungurtekin,
their lives are in danger.

01:46:30.442 --> 01:46:31.442
What?

01:47:02.676 --> 01:47:04.742
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:47:05.809 --> 01:47:07.809
-And peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:47:08.242 --> 01:47:10.076
-And peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:47:36.476 --> 01:47:37.809
With the name of God.

01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:44.842
In the 99 names of God most gracious,
most merciful.

01:47:47.342 --> 01:47:51.176
Beys, we had hard times.

01:47:52.509 --> 01:47:54.809
We were too close to our enemy.

01:47:56.609 --> 01:48:00.742
We have overtaken the traps
thanks to Ertugrul Bey.

01:48:04.442 --> 01:48:09.309
Now, we came together at the request of
Mother Hayme now.

01:48:11.442 --> 01:48:14.442
I also wanted to see Ertugrul Bey
in headquarter.

01:48:15.476 --> 01:48:16.709
He came, thankfully.

01:48:17.342 --> 01:48:18.476
Thank you, Korkut Bey.

01:48:19.709 --> 01:48:20.842
Here you go, Mother Hayme.

01:48:23.709 --> 01:48:27.176
Precious Beys of Dodurga and Kayi.

01:48:29.809 --> 01:48:32.876
After the invasion disaster we had

01:48:34.476 --> 01:48:39.076
we gave Alps of two nomad group
to a single Alp.

01:48:41.342 --> 01:48:42.742
I want you to know that

01:48:43.209 --> 01:48:47.876
we still support our decision today.

01:48:51.876 --> 01:48:54.809
If you still support that
what do you want then?

01:48:57.209 --> 01:49:00.809
We have witnessed that
what Ertugrul Bey said

01:49:01.676 --> 01:49:06.476
since he has been relieved
of duty is true.

01:49:07.709 --> 01:49:09.509
Is there anybody who can disaffirm?

01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:12.542
-That is true.
-It's right.

01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:14.842
What Ertugrul Bey said was true.

01:49:18.276 --> 01:49:20.176
Now you are saying that you regret.

01:49:22.309 --> 01:49:23.309
No.

01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:26.442
We are saying that
if Ertugrul Bey was here

01:49:27.209 --> 01:49:29.076
none of these would have happened.

01:49:37.509 --> 01:49:38.742
Enemy is wild.

01:49:40.142 --> 01:49:42.242
Gravity of situation is obvious.

01:49:45.809 --> 01:49:47.409
We are not looking for a scapegoat.

01:49:48.642 --> 01:49:51.476
We want to take precautions
so that we will be harmed again.

01:49:52.276 --> 01:49:54.609
You want to take head of Alps from me,
do not you?

01:50:01.242 --> 01:50:04.176
We demand that the head of Alps duty
should be given to us again.

01:50:10.776 --> 01:50:15.309
You want to gather strength
by using the opportunity you have.

01:50:22.642 --> 01:50:24.576
Do you know what strength
and power mean, Tugtekin?

01:50:28.442 --> 01:50:32.376
It means to follow the directions
by preventing your anger and nerve.

01:50:39.476 --> 01:50:40.476
Now...

01:50:43.409 --> 01:50:47.109
...the task of Tugtekin Bey was
to keep all Alps together and alive.

01:50:48.409 --> 01:50:52.142
But you showed weakness on your duty.

01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:59.309
Noyan used this and brought us
almost to shed blood of brother.

01:51:02.842 --> 01:51:04.642
Finally, you showed your
intention, Ertugrul.

01:51:08.276 --> 01:51:10.142
Now you want to use this opportunity.

01:51:12.876 --> 01:51:15.176
Will you take the control of Alps
with your one-hand?

01:51:16.342 --> 01:51:17.342
Is that what you want?

01:51:18.576 --> 01:51:19.576
No.

01:51:24.409 --> 01:51:25.476
I have no such a desire.

01:51:29.809 --> 01:51:31.176
We want that

01:51:32.342 --> 01:51:33.776
Gundogdu Bey will be head of Alps.

01:51:42.509 --> 01:51:44.242
-He is right.
-Yes.

01:51:47.742 --> 01:51:52.476
I also want that Gundogdu Bey
will be head of Alps.

01:51:56.842 --> 01:51:58.142
If you excuse me

01:51:59.242 --> 01:52:02.276
I would like to know
what you and your Beys think.

01:52:04.109 --> 01:52:07.176
You want that Hayme Hatun but

01:52:08.742 --> 01:52:11.442
we need to say stop for this matter.

01:52:13.809 --> 01:52:15.276
What will we tell the Alps?

01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:18.109
What will we say to people?

01:52:20.476 --> 01:52:22.409
If the situation changes
in the headquarter

01:52:23.442 --> 01:52:26.509
would not they say whay they do?

01:52:42.309 --> 01:52:43.342
If you excuse me, Bey.

01:52:44.309 --> 01:52:45.876
I also would like to say a few words.

01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:51.276
Here you go, Artuk Bey.

01:52:54.176 --> 01:52:56.142
Nomad tent is not peaceful
for a long time.

01:52:58.242 --> 01:53:01.809
People suffer pain because lack of
unity in the headquarter.

01:53:03.709 --> 01:53:09.642
If we fight inside and the enemy outside
we cannot prosper.

01:53:14.376 --> 01:53:19.209
Bey, if we united with the Kayis
and headed the same way

01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:22.576
then they should also have to judge.

01:53:34.676 --> 01:53:35.676
Thank you.

01:53:37.642 --> 01:53:40.609
Then let Bey of the headquarter decide it.

01:53:44.142 --> 01:53:45.142
Now...

01:53:47.142 --> 01:53:53.676
...those who want that Gundogdu Bey
will be head of Alps raise your hands.

01:54:38.609 --> 01:54:39.809
It was a salutary decision.

01:54:48.876 --> 01:54:50.242
Thank you, Gumustekin Bey.

01:54:53.676 --> 01:54:55.609
If you excuse me, Bey?

01:54:56.209 --> 01:54:57.276
There you go, son.

01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:07.776
God bless the Beys of two nomad groups
who awarded me with this task.

01:55:08.509 --> 01:55:09.842
-Thank you.
-Amen.

01:55:10.542 --> 01:55:11.709
Feel comfortable.

01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:17.476
Know that I will know the Alps of
both the nomad groups as my brothers.

01:55:20.276 --> 01:55:25.509
I will prepare them for the war
just like the sons of the same father.

01:55:28.309 --> 01:55:31.242
May God not embrace us for our decision.

01:55:31.642 --> 01:55:33.376
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:55:37.342 --> 01:55:39.809
-May God not embrace you.
-If God permits, mother.

01:55:42.876 --> 01:55:44.209
May God not embrace you.

01:56:04.176 --> 01:56:05.476
How could you do that, Gumustekin Bey?

01:56:10.376 --> 01:56:13.676
How could you pass over me
in front of the Beys?

01:56:16.542 --> 01:56:17.576
That is not true.

01:56:19.276 --> 01:56:21.709
It was not me, it was your father.

01:56:23.442 --> 01:56:27.076
Your father and the other Beys
had already made their decisions.

01:56:28.442 --> 01:56:30.142
They were prepared to sacrifice you.

01:56:31.676 --> 01:56:34.442
They were about to take the head of
Alps duty from you.

01:56:36.242 --> 01:56:38.342
I wish I could do something, son.

01:56:39.576 --> 01:56:40.576
I wish.

01:56:45.442 --> 01:56:48.776
First, you pull yourself together
and enjoy your wedding.

01:56:49.709 --> 01:56:52.276
Enjoy bridal chamber of our lovely bride.

01:56:53.642 --> 01:56:58.509
Your real task and exam will start then.

01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:03.742
What do you mean?

01:57:06.076 --> 01:57:07.576
Oh, Tugtekin, oh!

01:57:09.576 --> 01:57:10.876
You are a smart man.

01:57:13.276 --> 01:57:15.876
Your father can no longer carry the load
of being head. Do not you see that?

01:57:16.876 --> 01:57:18.176
He is sick.

01:57:19.176 --> 01:57:20.509
He does not have so much time.

01:57:22.209 --> 01:57:24.109
Now it is your time.

01:57:25.642 --> 01:57:28.342
Know that, when it is the time

01:57:29.342 --> 01:57:30.809
I will be with your side

01:57:32.242 --> 01:57:33.676
whatever happens.

01:58:21.876 --> 01:58:22.876
Mother.

01:58:29.876 --> 01:58:32.642
I would like to have your permission
for asking for a girl's...

01:58:37.709 --> 01:58:39.176
...hand in marriage tomorrow.

01:58:52.876 --> 01:58:55.709
If Selcan agrees, I will not divorce her.

01:58:59.142 --> 01:59:01.842
If she does not, she knows better.

01:59:14.542 --> 01:59:20.109
If you will be happy and have children
and grow your family

01:59:21.176 --> 01:59:22.409
I agree, Bey.

01:59:36.476 --> 01:59:37.476
Who is this girl?

01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:45.776
Goncagul Hatun.

01:59:57.376 --> 01:59:58.709
Does Gumustekin know that?

02:00:02.076 --> 02:00:04.642
I will be happy if you send someone
and let them now that

02:00:05.676 --> 02:00:07.709
we will come for asking the girl's
hand in marriage, mother.

02:00:17.342 --> 02:00:18.776
If that is what you want

02:00:21.576 --> 02:00:22.776
and if Selcan

02:00:25.476 --> 02:00:26.742
agrees

02:00:29.476 --> 02:00:33.242
then you have my permission.
Good luck with that.

02:00:34.609 --> 02:00:35.742
Thank you.

02:00:36.609 --> 02:00:38.442
Good appetite. If you excuse me.

02:01:00.242 --> 02:01:01.276
If you excuse me.

02:01:17.742 --> 02:01:20.376
Everybody's destiny
is written differently.

02:01:23.542 --> 02:01:25.242
May God give patience to both of them.

02:01:30.542 --> 02:01:31.542
If you excuse me.

02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:38.842
If God permits, mother.

02:01:40.576 --> 02:01:42.876
Do you think that Goncagul Hatun
may be wife of my brother, mother?

02:01:46.642 --> 02:01:47.876
I wanted to have Selcan.

02:01:49.842 --> 02:01:51.309
Gundogdu was not peaceful.

02:01:53.576 --> 02:01:57.376
Now he can choose for himself.

02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:01.142
Thank you, mother.

02:02:03.209 --> 02:02:04.609
When will Halime come back, son?

02:02:05.776 --> 02:02:08.442
He went to give information about
Atabey Ertokus to Sultan Alaeddin.

02:02:09.876 --> 02:02:11.809
He will report about us and return.

02:03:38.442 --> 02:03:39.442
God.

02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:44.476
Surely you are the best of those
who sets us a trap.

02:03:46.276 --> 02:03:48.209
God, destroy the traps set up for us.

02:03:50.609 --> 02:03:53.509
Do not leave me alone
do not leave me to my enemies.

02:03:55.076 --> 02:03:58.076
Empower me so I can sacrifice my life

02:03:58.309 --> 02:04:01.509
for the ummah that is scattered
as the pieces of a rosary.

02:04:03.076 --> 02:04:06.209
Do not pull your hand off
so we do not fall prey to our enemies.

02:04:08.409 --> 02:04:11.076
Help us so we can fulfill your wish.

02:04:12.509 --> 02:04:15.576
We can carry your name with us
to where sun comes up and sinks.

02:04:16.742 --> 02:04:22.509
Help us so the azan will be recited
all around the heaven.

02:04:24.509 --> 02:04:28.142
God, do not let me separate
from the right way.

02:04:47.409 --> 02:04:48.576
<i>May I come in, Bey?</i>

02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:51.776
Come, Geyikli, come.

02:04:59.509 --> 02:05:00.542
Ertugrul Bey.

02:05:04.209 --> 02:05:07.342
Abdurrahman Alp brought news
from Noyan, Bey.

02:05:14.376 --> 02:05:15.442
What does he say?

02:05:16.809 --> 02:05:18.176
Halime Sultan...

02:05:21.509 --> 02:05:22.676
...is in danger, Bey.

02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:30.276
He sent Karabek after them
to kill them in the palace.

02:05:58.842 --> 02:06:00.309
What will I do, mother?

02:06:03.542 --> 02:06:07.176
How can I be willing that
he will sleep with that woman?

02:06:12.676 --> 02:06:16.442
If you love your husband,
you will fight, daughter.

02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:22.142
But know that

02:06:23.876 --> 02:06:26.609
you are still in his heart.

02:06:32.742 --> 02:06:36.242
He know what you have done for him.

02:06:38.142 --> 02:06:41.076
He knows that you love him.
He knows your respect to him.

02:06:44.476 --> 02:06:46.109
That is why he does not divorce you.

02:06:48.509 --> 02:06:50.476
That is why he does not indulge.

02:07:15.442 --> 02:07:16.876
I wish that he would kill me.

02:07:19.576 --> 02:07:22.676
I wish that he could save me
dying like that every day.

02:07:49.709 --> 02:07:50.809
It is time to leave for us, brother.

02:07:52.309 --> 02:07:53.709
If I cannot stop Karabey

02:07:54.609 --> 02:07:57.576
Halime Sultan and Wild Demir's lives
are in danger.

02:07:58.309 --> 02:08:01.109
Ertugrul, it does not work
like that, brother.

02:08:01.709 --> 02:08:03.176
Let me go with you.

02:08:05.542 --> 02:08:08.142
The nomad group and mother
are entrusted you, brother.

02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:11.776
It is so now.

02:08:12.809 --> 02:08:14.676
If I have a trouble, you will
be the one who knows that.

02:08:15.376 --> 02:08:17.876
No, brother. I hope that you will
not have any trouble.

02:08:18.609 --> 02:08:21.642
But if you will, I will always
support you. Just you know that.

02:08:22.842 --> 02:08:23.876
Thank you.

02:08:25.676 --> 02:08:28.309
I will come to see how much difficulties

02:08:28.509 --> 02:08:30.676
you will have in front of your
father-in-law, if I can catch.

02:08:33.476 --> 02:08:34.709
You, rascal you.

02:08:38.242 --> 02:08:39.242
Good.
