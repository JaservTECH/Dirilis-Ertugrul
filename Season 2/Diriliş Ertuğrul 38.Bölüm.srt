00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 38 will start after 12:19 min.

12:19.717 --> 12:23.717
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:24.986 --> 12:28.663
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:29.034 --> 12:32.034
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:35.514 --> 12:38.447
You killed her. You killed her.

12:39.314 --> 12:44.947
You walk among others shamelessly
while you have blood on your hands.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.947
You are looking into their
eyes impertinently. You rubbish!

12:48.714 --> 12:51.014
You shut your filthy mouth, woman!

12:51.247 --> 12:53.280
Do you know what you are saying?

12:56.014 --> 12:59.347
That is enough. Stop shushing me!

13:00.580 --> 13:05.580
I am saying that this rubbish killed
that old woman on that hillside.

13:08.014 --> 13:12.814
This is disgrace! Could you not
hold your sick woman, Gundogdu?

13:13.247 --> 13:15.014
What kind of a man are you?

13:23.814 --> 13:28.214
I am sick of this
shameless woman's slanders!

13:29.747 --> 13:33.447
If she says one more word...

13:34.214 --> 13:37.580
...I swear to God I will
bring this to the headquarters.

13:41.980 --> 13:45.247
You are talking about
headquarters unashamedly!

13:45.880 --> 13:49.880
A creature like you do not have
any place in the headquarters.

13:49.980 --> 13:51.847
-Quiet!
-Selcan!

13:55.380 --> 13:57.414
Why are you so presumptuous?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.780
Why are you so shameless?

14:07.414 --> 14:11.247
How can you talk such baseless
to Hatun of Dodurga's Bey...

14:11.347 --> 14:14.447
...in front of everyone?

14:16.680 --> 14:18.347
She killed her, mother.

14:18.747 --> 14:22.247
This cheap creature
killed that woman.

14:22.314 --> 14:23.747
Do you not get it?

14:27.747 --> 14:29.814
What does this mean, Aytolun?

14:30.880 --> 14:33.280
I wish I knew, Hayme.

14:57.599 --> 14:59.099
What are you doing here?

14:59.499 --> 15:02.465
I am here to take revenge from
the man who killed Ertokus...

15:02.532 --> 15:04.299
...and betrayed his state.

15:05.265 --> 15:07.965
It is true that we
have a traitor among us.

15:08.399 --> 15:10.665
But it's not me.

15:11.665 --> 15:14.465
It has been your Alp
Kocash since the beginning.

15:27.132 --> 15:29.565
He has been the dog of Noyan
since the very beginning.

15:30.299 --> 15:31.699
Leave these lies aside.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.965
You and your men are traitors.

15:37.465 --> 15:43.332
And you shamelessly blame my Alp Kocash
who has saved your big brother's life.

15:47.332 --> 15:51.032
You are so naive that
I just pity for you.

15:51.132 --> 15:52.432
Enough!

16:04.232 --> 16:05.532
Selcan.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.999
Why do you think that she
killed that poor woman?

16:12.165 --> 16:15.299
Because I know it, mother.
She is the murderer.

16:15.399 --> 16:17.465
She killed that woman.

16:20.165 --> 16:22.399
I saw the woman coming
to the carpet house.

16:22.665 --> 16:26.665
She grew pale when she
saw her. She pulled her.

16:26.899 --> 16:30.565
Pushed and shoved her. Then
expelled her from the nomad group.

16:34.032 --> 16:36.999
After that they have found her body.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.432
You cheap creature!

16:46.632 --> 16:51.965
Okay but why do you think that I
killed that woman, Selcan Hatun?

16:56.299 --> 17:00.665
If you cannot prove your allegation
it means that you are the snake...

17:00.899 --> 17:05.065
...decrier, slanderous
of these two nomad groups.

17:10.999 --> 17:14.532
I have expelled that woman from
the nomad group. That is true.

17:16.332 --> 17:23.299
But since then I have neither left the
nomad group nor the carpet house today.

17:24.065 --> 17:30.465
My man along with Dodurga and Kayi
women who works here are my witnesses.

17:42.499 --> 17:43.999
Now.

17:45.132 --> 17:51.099
You either prove your allegation
or I meet you in the headquarters.

17:51.365 --> 17:56.132
This requires being at the headquarters. I
will be calling you to account over there.

18:01.132 --> 18:03.332
Prove your allegation now.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.532
I said prove it!

18:12.532 --> 18:14.265
Tell me, Selcan.

18:15.965 --> 18:17.965
What made you think so?

18:19.432 --> 18:22.432
Tell me what did you
count on yourself?

18:25.565 --> 18:27.365
Because I know it, mother.

18:27.432 --> 18:29.532
I know that she killed that woman.

18:29.599 --> 18:31.632
Believe me that she
killed her. I know it.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.532
So she knows it.

18:42.299 --> 18:48.299
We know what you did to the
nomad group with Kurdoglu.

18:57.232 --> 19:01.532
We know that you had Aykiz whipped by
slandering her about she made you...

19:01.599 --> 19:03.199
...had a miscarriage.

19:25.932 --> 19:31.165
Now stand by your allegation
if you can, Selcan.

19:32.999 --> 19:36.299
All scandals have been unfolded.

19:47.132 --> 19:48.632
Gundogdu.

19:49.532 --> 19:51.965
Take your wife away.

19:54.699 --> 19:57.199
-Mother.
-Come with me.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.199
-Mother.
-Come with me!

20:15.899 --> 20:22.699
Selcan Hatun is really messed up in
the head. May God give your patience.

20:25.932 --> 20:29.432
How do you know that
poor woman, Aytolun?

20:31.432 --> 20:33.099
I know her from the nomad group.

20:34.932 --> 20:38.165
She used to live on the
side of the nomad group once.

20:38.232 --> 20:44.165
Whenever she had trouble, she'd
come to gain favor from me.

20:44.365 --> 20:48.899
She crossed the line this time so
I expelled her from the nomad group.

20:50.099 --> 20:52.332
That is all.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.232
Forgive my daughter, Aytolun.

21:11.899 --> 21:18.032
I would not be more embarrassed  if you
did not bring it to the headquarters.

21:32.132 --> 21:35.032
Go back to your work,
sisters. Come on.

21:43.632 --> 21:46.499
Don't get upset, Gokce.

21:47.065 --> 21:52.932
You are the bride of our marquee
and joy of our family, girl.

21:52.999 --> 21:54.365
Know this as it is.

22:31.899 --> 22:33.465
So you want a festivity?

22:35.899 --> 22:37.932
Let this festivity begin then.

22:39.599 --> 22:42.332
If God permits you have learned
how to fight, uncle's son.

22:42.965 --> 22:46.199
We learned a lot thanks to
your traitors, aunt's son.

22:52.032 --> 22:53.299
That is really good.

22:53.965 --> 22:58.099
I wish you had noticed that
the traitor cunt is next to you.

22:59.332 --> 23:00.999
He brought you here.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.565
Stop talking and surrender.

23:06.165 --> 23:09.265
Gokce Hatun is the one who told
me that you will be here, Ertugrul.

23:16.332 --> 23:20.432
Forget about these lies, be a
brave man, be a man, Ertugrul.

23:22.199 --> 23:26.265
Let's say you want to lure me in,
why do you pull your woman Halime...

23:26.399 --> 23:28.132
...into this, Ertugrul?

23:46.032 --> 23:48.465
You look good in the
woman suit, Dogan.

23:54.532 --> 23:56.065
You must understand it already.

23:57.065 --> 24:02.099
This traitor scumbag has lured both of
us into a trap. They should be here soon.

24:12.332 --> 24:14.465
Why are we still
waiting, Baycu Noyan?

24:15.065 --> 24:17.532
It's nice to watch
the dogfight, Tangut.

24:25.265 --> 24:26.632
Listen to me, Hatun.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.432
I have warned you time after
time but that did not work.

24:29.499 --> 24:31.999
I have thrown you away from
my bed but that did not work.

24:32.099 --> 24:35.699
I did things that was not suitable
for a man and hit you with my hand...

24:35.932 --> 24:37.999
...but that did not work, as well.

24:39.165 --> 24:43.932
From now on, I do not want to
see your face, hear your voice...

24:43.999 --> 24:45.565
...even pass through your shadow.

24:45.965 --> 24:49.132
Get off of my back.
Get out of my life.

24:51.665 --> 24:54.665
I was afraid of the dark
at the end of this path.

24:55.399 --> 24:57.599
But I am not afraid of it anymore.

24:58.099 --> 25:00.999
I know that there is light
at the end of the path.

25:01.132 --> 25:04.399
Woman! You are still talking.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.665
God damn you.

25:07.599 --> 25:12.265
I will prove what kind
of a woman Aytolun is.

25:15.065 --> 25:17.165
After that you will be ashamed.

25:18.332 --> 25:22.932
But I will not be on your side.

25:44.232 --> 25:45.599
That is enough.

26:48.299 --> 26:50.432
Do not be upset, Halime Sultan.

26:51.599 --> 26:53.365
Do not.

26:57.232 --> 27:00.099
I am worried about
Ertugrul Bey, Wild Demir.

27:04.899 --> 27:07.999
If God permits they will find out that
Kocash is a traitor so we would not...

27:08.299 --> 27:10.265
...have to go to Konya.

27:11.932 --> 27:14.365
If God permits, girl.

27:15.132 --> 27:21.132
However one lives one's fate.

27:43.899 --> 27:45.532
You have a lot to learn, uncle's son.

28:03.899 --> 28:06.632
You have forgotten to use weapons
because of your disability.

28:25.332 --> 28:26.565
Open your eyes.

28:26.699 --> 28:28.899
Open your eyes and look around.

28:36.565 --> 28:40.232
Where are they? Where are Mongols?

28:54.599 --> 28:56.399
Attack!

31:03.099 --> 31:05.299
Come on, Noyan. Come here.

31:08.899 --> 31:11.099
Tugtekin is not so bad, Tangut.

31:11.165 --> 31:14.099
We have made Turks kneel
down in lots of battles.

31:15.465 --> 31:19.332
Turks are the best battle
soldiers on the earth.

31:20.899 --> 31:27.699
But Turks without a leader would
equal to a flock without a shepherd.

31:28.699 --> 31:35.565
They would become lions on the battlefield
if they find a leader who they believe in.

31:38.532 --> 31:41.499
If we do not stop Ertugrul he
will reinvigorate this flock.

31:42.365 --> 31:44.299
Then why don't we attack?

31:44.965 --> 31:50.699
If you want to be a good hunter,
Tangut you should make the bait bigger.

31:57.065 --> 31:59.499
I will throw such a bait
to Kayis and Dodurgas...

32:00.499 --> 32:03.232
...they will fall apart
without using swords.

32:46.299 --> 32:49.199
Open your eyes! Look around!

32:49.632 --> 32:51.532
I would have killed
you if I wanted to.

32:51.999 --> 32:54.199
Tell your soldiers
to drop their weapons.

33:20.532 --> 33:21.899
Alps.

33:24.365 --> 33:25.599
We are leaving.

33:26.965 --> 33:29.165
Or brothers blood will be shed.

34:26.065 --> 34:27.399
We will follow them.

34:34.999 --> 34:36.965
Party is starting, Tangut.

35:05.365 --> 35:06.899
Why are we running away, Bey?

35:06.965 --> 35:09.665
We will not shed our
brothers blood, Turgut.

35:10.165 --> 35:11.665
Kocash has pulled a trick on us.

36:27.565 --> 36:29.499
Ertugrul!

36:33.465 --> 36:35.299
Ertugrul!

36:44.365 --> 36:46.965
Ertugrul!

37:11.199 --> 37:13.632
Your voice is echoing
everywhere, Tugtekin.

37:16.632 --> 37:18.932
Do not shout out so loud.

37:21.032 --> 37:22.899
Your throat would get hurt.

37:23.965 --> 37:25.532
Noyan.

37:35.032 --> 37:36.232
Selcan.

37:36.499 --> 37:39.399
Selcan. Selcan knows
everything, brother.

37:40.965 --> 37:42.332
That you killed Duru, too?

37:42.399 --> 37:46.499
I do not know but she
will not let it go.

37:48.565 --> 37:53.265
There is Ertugrul outside of
the nomad group and Selcan is in.

37:54.699 --> 37:56.899
We have challenging rivals.

37:57.565 --> 37:59.399
Do not forget Halime and Wild Demir.

37:59.465 --> 38:02.632
If God permits Tugtekin
will take Ertugrul's life.

38:05.699 --> 38:09.065
I have no more endurance
left for him, brother.

38:09.165 --> 38:11.699
He constantly blames
himself for his wife's death.

38:11.999 --> 38:14.199
He always has a guilty conscience.

38:14.365 --> 38:19.265
Crying every damn
day! And also groaning.

38:19.999 --> 38:24.232
Day and night, he is putting me
through hell in his bed, marquee...

38:24.299 --> 38:27.932
...everywhere, brother.
I am out of patience.

38:29.899 --> 38:31.632
Be patient, Aytolun.

38:33.099 --> 38:35.699
We should have my daughter
and Gundogdu get married first.

38:36.065 --> 38:39.899
We should be in charge
first. Be patient.

38:40.465 --> 38:45.699
Power syrup that I give him everyday
rules his heart and his breath.

38:46.199 --> 38:51.132
One day I will add one more
drop of it and it will be over.

38:57.999 --> 39:00.299
You  were impatient when
you were young as well.

39:01.432 --> 39:05.932
We will take his marquee
first, then the nomad group.

39:08.265 --> 39:10.165
Step by step.

39:11.899 --> 39:15.099
Soon after that nobody will be able
to stand in front of us, brother.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.399
You traitor scumbag!

40:06.065 --> 40:08.099
It is correct that we
have a traitor among us.

40:08.499 --> 40:09.932
But it's not me.

40:09.999 --> 40:12.665
It has been your Alp
Kocash since the beginning.

40:15.532 --> 40:18.365
This traitor scumbag has
lured both of us into a trap.

40:18.432 --> 40:19.532
They should be here soon.

40:20.165 --> 40:24.399
After the damage is done it has
a big price, right, Tugtekin?

40:24.965 --> 40:27.299
I have buried too many like you.

40:36.165 --> 40:37.932
Ulubilge.

42:28.837 --> 42:30.370
So what did we do now, brother?

42:31.503 --> 42:34.003
-Be silent, brother.
-I could not understand anything.

42:34.270 --> 42:36.970
We have been waiting for infidel Mongols
but these scrubs came out.

42:39.703 --> 42:41.603
Bamsi, can you still not understand?

42:42.037 --> 42:44.037
What do you carry in your head
instead of a brain?

42:46.303 --> 42:48.737
I am sorry Bey, forgive me.

42:49.670 --> 42:50.970
It is just an empty head.

42:51.503 --> 42:53.670
Sometimes, your words are
as empty as your head.

45:52.670 --> 45:53.837
Come, Tugtekin.

47:21.903 --> 47:23.037
Tugtekin.

47:24.303 --> 47:25.503
Fiery Boy.

47:37.370 --> 47:42.270
Now, go and tell the world
of Noyan's valor.

48:58.270 --> 49:03.737
We have suffered many pains, fought
many battles from the fatherland to here

49:04.570 --> 49:07.603
but we have never been down on our uppers
this much, daughter Halime.

49:12.470 --> 49:14.637
If God permits, we will
overcome this, Wild Demir.

49:16.437 --> 49:17.437
If God permits.

49:17.503 --> 49:20.337
If Ertugrul Bey succeeds,
we will get rid of this pit.

49:31.803 --> 49:33.337
Thank God, Bey.

49:53.337 --> 49:56.570
What is it, Bey?
You are down in the mouth.

49:57.470 --> 49:58.737
We could not triumph.

49:59.903 --> 50:00.970
Why, Bey?

50:02.637 --> 50:04.403
We were waiting for Mongols

50:05.470 --> 50:06.937
Tugtekin stood against us.

50:07.737 --> 50:09.403
But there was no sign of Mongols.

50:09.737 --> 50:11.537
Bey, how did they know?

50:13.537 --> 50:14.537
Gokce.

50:19.503 --> 50:21.403
Satan is playing such a trick on us

50:22.037 --> 50:24.503
that we forget in which land
we fool around.

50:29.770 --> 50:32.937
-Bey, we shall set off then.
-Not now.

50:34.570 --> 50:36.403
Mongols must be looking for us everywhere.

50:39.437 --> 50:42.270
We are going to go to the cave, get ready.

50:42.703 --> 50:44.903
Bey, the horses need to rest.

50:50.437 --> 50:52.870
They must be exhausted
of fighting with us, too.

51:12.403 --> 51:13.470
Turgut?

51:49.870 --> 51:52.003
-Bamsi.
-Yes, Master.

51:53.870 --> 51:56.037
What is the problem, son?
If someone sees you

51:56.370 --> 51:58.603
they would think you never
cut a heathen's head.

51:59.037 --> 52:01.270
That is true. I could not.

52:02.303 --> 52:04.770
Is that why you are downcast?

52:07.570 --> 52:08.737
No, Master.

52:10.237 --> 52:11.437
Then why?

52:15.237 --> 52:19.903
I upset Ertugrul Bey with this
billet-like empty head of mine

52:20.703 --> 52:24.537
and this tuneless tongue of mine.
That is why I am mad.

52:30.903 --> 52:34.737
Lions! Lions!

52:34.970 --> 52:37.603
As long as you stand straight
behind our Bey like this

52:37.737 --> 52:40.970
no one can bend us down,
no one can make us kneel.

52:41.037 --> 52:42.537
With god's help.

52:45.637 --> 52:46.870
God is greatest.

52:49.003 --> 52:52.403
-God is greatest.
-God is greatest.

52:52.603 --> 52:55.237
-God is greatest.
-God is greatest.

52:56.670 --> 52:57.937
God is greatest.

52:58.003 --> 53:00.270
Each one would die for you, Bey.

53:05.670 --> 53:08.470
I am glad I have them.

53:10.537 --> 53:13.370
Yet I cannot give them the heathen's head.

53:17.670 --> 53:19.937
The enemy is stronger than we thought.

53:21.770 --> 53:23.037
I want to fight...

53:25.303 --> 53:28.937
...but my hand is not ready.
I barely hold the sword.

53:56.570 --> 53:58.303
Those days will come, too, Ertugrul.

54:00.537 --> 54:02.903
Those days that you will shed
enemy's blood is near.

54:09.237 --> 54:11.237
If I could not stop these tyrants

54:12.603 --> 54:15.970
there will be nothing left
of my bravery or gallantness.

54:24.737 --> 54:25.837
We are ready to go, Bey.

55:22.670 --> 55:24.803
Devil can take him for all I care.

55:26.003 --> 55:27.970
He thought being a Bey's son
was such prowess.

55:30.270 --> 55:32.503
May your carrion fall prey.

55:58.337 --> 55:59.370
Kocabash.

56:02.303 --> 56:03.470
You will go to the nomad tent.

56:05.237 --> 56:06.803
And say that Tugtekin died.

56:08.837 --> 56:11.903
You will say, Ertugrul killed Tugtekin.

56:18.637 --> 56:21.237
Let Kayi and Dodurga tribes
get up against each other.

56:22.437 --> 56:24.270
Let them take each other's lives.

56:25.403 --> 56:28.670
And I will come and take
the lives of the rest.

56:31.737 --> 56:32.737
Take the road.

56:37.837 --> 56:39.270
Kocabash!

56:46.270 --> 56:48.737
You do not seem like you got out
of a battle at all.

57:47.470 --> 57:48.670
Go on, goodbye!

57:57.470 --> 57:58.503
Yes.

57:59.670 --> 58:01.370
It is good like this.

58:17.903 --> 58:20.470
Ulubilge, I feel a glow
of happiness today.

58:23.337 --> 58:24.703
The sky is great.

58:26.237 --> 58:29.370
The trees and birds are great, as well.

58:31.337 --> 58:34.903
Ertugrul slipped through our fingers.
We could not kill them both.

58:37.403 --> 58:39.637
Sometimes you are bulk headed, Tangut.

58:41.570 --> 58:45.303
If you killed two people, then
you would have killed two people.

58:46.570 --> 58:48.703
But now, Ertugrul is a living dead.

58:49.803 --> 58:51.637
And the nomad tent is a fire ground.

58:52.737 --> 58:56.237
They will get up against each other.
Each other.

59:21.503 --> 59:25.770
Ertugrul was not the one who killed
Seljuk soldiers and abducted Ertokus.

59:32.470 --> 59:33.770
What are you talking about, brother?

59:35.803 --> 59:37.637
Unfortunately, that is the truth, Aytolun.

59:39.670 --> 59:42.603
I have not a shadow of a doubt
that Ertugrul is guiltless.

59:45.903 --> 59:50.470
But I am not sure whether
the truth or the lie...

59:52.037 --> 59:53.837
...would serve our purpose.

00:59:57.003 --> 01:00:00.870
I do not know how the matter
of Ertugrul will be solved

01:00:01.437 --> 01:00:05.003
but Gundogdu and Goncagul must marry.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:09.003
Then Gundogdu would always take your side.

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:12.337
We only need Hayme to allow this marriage.

01:00:13.737 --> 01:00:17.603
We must seize Kayi, regardless
of the consequence.

01:00:18.437 --> 01:00:24.570
First, I need to win Gundogdu's heart
then Hayme Hatun's heart for it.

01:00:45.837 --> 01:00:49.503
Konya taught me the battles are won
in the hareem of the palace

01:00:50.237 --> 01:00:52.970
not in the battlefield.

01:00:56.337 --> 01:00:59.837
It seems that the nomad's marquee
and the Sultan's palace...

01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:04.437
...are the real battlefield.

01:01:19.003 --> 01:01:20.703
I pray every night, for you to die

01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:22.737
so we could get rid of you, sister,
do you know?

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:31.270
Gokce, we both took the seeds of sin
inside us, from our father.

01:01:33.703 --> 01:01:36.503
His greed, arrogance...

01:01:38.003 --> 01:01:39.470
...grudge...

01:01:41.303 --> 01:01:44.270
...and everlasting hatred.

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:53.470
My beautiful sister.

01:01:54.537 --> 01:02:00.303
Thank God, I cleaned my soul
with the breath of his Ibn Arabi.

01:02:02.003 --> 01:02:05.670
Now I am paying the price
for my sins, Gokce.

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:08.970
And you, sister...

01:02:10.303 --> 01:02:12.837
...do not think that I do not know
what you are doing.

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:17.937
Your intention is not to marry
and build a happy family.

01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:20.737
You have one care.

01:02:21.403 --> 01:02:28.003
That is to vent your unrequited love
on Ertugrul and Halime.

01:02:29.437 --> 01:02:33.537
Gokce, my beautiful sister.
Do not do that.

01:02:33.637 --> 01:02:38.470
Remember your sister. You will burn
like a kindling in this sea of sin.

01:02:38.803 --> 01:02:42.437
I am telling you for the last time.
Pull yourself together.

01:02:42.837 --> 01:02:45.570
-Pull yourself together and...
-Enough!

01:02:57.803 --> 01:03:01.237
Your heart has been defiled enough
to waste Tugtekin's love

01:03:01.337 --> 01:03:02.870
for your sneaky vengeance.

01:03:03.037 --> 01:03:07.337
You are cruel as my father
who wanted to kill Suleyman Shah.

01:03:09.637 --> 01:03:14.537
Maybe every slap will remind you
who you are...

01:03:16.337 --> 01:03:20.403
...who you are not and
who you can never be.

01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:25.937
Maybe you will remember you grew up
with marquee's blessings.

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.537
And you need to be grateful.

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:31.970
Maybe you will remember
you reached the age of marriage

01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:35.803
with the love of Suleyman Shah
and Mother Hayme

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:42.803
maybe you will repent and
get rid of this fiend inside you.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:44.270
Get up!

01:03:58.703 --> 01:03:59.870
Gokce.

01:04:03.837 --> 01:04:05.003
Get out, daughter.

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:26.603
Selcan, what is this, daughter?

01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:30.837
You are in a rage again.

01:04:32.937 --> 01:04:36.570
I cannot stand, mother. I cannot stand.

01:04:37.237 --> 01:04:39.837
No one sees what I see.

01:04:40.303 --> 01:04:45.237
The devil called Aytolun
wants to ruin our marquee.

01:04:45.737 --> 01:04:48.370
She wants to use Gundogdu and Gokce.

01:04:48.603 --> 01:04:51.403
Selcan, that is enough. Enough.

01:04:52.937 --> 01:04:54.803
You have troubles with Aytolun.

01:04:56.037 --> 01:04:58.303
Gundogdu hates you.

01:04:59.537 --> 01:05:01.037
You slapped Gokce.

01:05:02.837 --> 01:05:04.870
Do you not come to heel, daughter?

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:08.637
That is enough.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:11.237
Stop being apprehensive.

01:05:13.237 --> 01:05:15.637
I want a tiny bit of peace.

01:05:16.637 --> 01:05:18.970
Whatever a man sowed, he shall reap.

01:05:19.937 --> 01:05:24.837
Selcan, know that I ran out of patience.

01:05:43.937 --> 01:05:47.470
Aytolun, it is all over.

01:05:48.837 --> 01:05:50.937
From now on, Aytolun

01:05:51.837 --> 01:05:54.637
I will show what you are.

01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:57.037
From now on

01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:00.403
I have the right to be as sneaky as you

01:06:00.903 --> 01:06:05.270
as vile as you as you.

01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:18.403
Mother, I have no patience anymore.

01:06:18.803 --> 01:06:21.470
She came to herself after she repented.

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:23.737
I was thrilled.

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:29.970
She slapped Gokce.
She completely lost herself.

01:06:31.537 --> 01:06:35.570
It is not going to work, mother.
I will either be a killer or divorce her.

01:06:42.403 --> 01:06:44.303
If you are tired that much...

01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:49.903
...find another girl who can
give you a child, son.

01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:56.270
But do not divorce Selcan.

01:06:56.503 --> 01:06:59.637
A son of a Bey does not divorce
and turn his wife adrift.

01:07:00.003 --> 01:07:01.703
It is not in accordance with our mores.

01:07:03.303 --> 01:07:06.437
What if she does not consent me
having a second wife?

01:07:06.737 --> 01:07:08.937
What if she brings bigger troubles to us?

01:07:10.537 --> 01:07:12.270
We will think about it at that time.

01:07:15.003 --> 01:07:18.603
If she does not behave herself, she can't
stay in my marquee and nomad tent.

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:55.403
Bey, apparently you wanted to see me.

01:08:57.537 --> 01:09:00.437
I know you take a ride to collect grass
for your father every day.

01:09:01.503 --> 01:09:02.837
But, I...

01:09:04.003 --> 01:09:05.037
We shall sit down.

01:09:07.337 --> 01:09:09.003
I witnessed what happened today.

01:09:19.603 --> 01:09:21.903
I cannot look at my uncle's
and aunt's face.

01:09:28.337 --> 01:09:30.403
Bey, Selcan is a troublesome a woman.

01:09:31.837 --> 01:09:33.937
And it is obvious that you are merciful.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:37.503
You have a heart so pure
to cast aside your wife

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:40.270
you have shared your bed with
for many years.

01:09:42.737 --> 01:09:44.837
Your children had died one by one.

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:47.937
May God give you and her patience.

01:09:52.503 --> 01:09:55.503
Apparently, all these pains
made her like this, Bey.

01:09:57.003 --> 01:09:59.370
Not one, not two, five children

01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:01.537
had joined the choir invisible
before they were born.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:10.837
But you, Gundogdu Bey

01:10:11.903 --> 01:10:13.837
you are the hope of Kayi.

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:17.503
I know that you have many burdens.

01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:22.603
Being this sorrowful and alone
does not befit you, Bey.

01:10:28.803 --> 01:10:31.737
Your words are as beautiful as your eyes.

01:10:38.637 --> 01:10:40.903
Anyway, excuse me.
I shall go to headquarters.

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:43.603
Will you talk about Ertugrul?

01:10:44.837 --> 01:10:45.903
I will.

01:10:47.303 --> 01:10:49.770
Do you still believe that
Ertugrul is innocent?

01:10:50.503 --> 01:10:51.770
Forever.

01:10:53.503 --> 01:10:58.737
I want to you know, I believe your
brother is innocent, too, Gundogdu Bey.

01:11:01.337 --> 01:11:03.270
Thank you.

01:11:31.737 --> 01:11:36.003
I know Ertugrul Bey is innocent,
as much as you do, Hayme Hatun.

01:11:36.537 --> 01:11:38.337
But that is not the point.

01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:41.670
We must prove that Ertugrul is guiltless.

01:11:46.003 --> 01:11:50.470
I know that you love my son
at least as much as Suleyman Shah.

01:11:53.037 --> 01:11:56.970
I saw you were not pleased at all

01:11:57.403 --> 01:11:59.603
when we took the head of Alps duty
from Ertugrul.

01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:05.837
You only said okay with you hand shaking
just so there would not be duality.

01:12:06.037 --> 01:12:07.270
Thank you.

01:12:08.403 --> 01:12:11.837
But I want you to take my son's side
in this headquarters.

01:12:13.337 --> 01:12:18.037
When we take a stand against
the rumors for him

01:12:19.037 --> 01:12:21.270
we wish to see you with us.

01:12:22.837 --> 01:12:26.470
Even if two nomad tents would burn,
I could not take the frame's side.

01:12:26.637 --> 01:12:30.337
It would not befit me, our mores
and our religion.

01:12:31.237 --> 01:12:33.437
You can rest assured, Hayme Hatun.

01:12:34.337 --> 01:12:36.570
But the pitcher is full.

01:12:37.703 --> 01:12:39.970
If one more drop falls...

01:12:42.237 --> 01:12:43.703
...may God help us.

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:56.903
Kocabash slipped through the net again.

01:12:58.837 --> 01:13:01.670
-Bey, what if he is not the betrayer?
-What if someone else is?

01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:04.770
No, he is betrayer.

01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:10.503
Even though his tongue says he is not,
his eyes represent Satan.

01:13:12.237 --> 01:13:14.270
I am sure, he is the betrayer.

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:17.303
What will we do, Bey?

01:13:19.570 --> 01:13:21.937
We shall to go to nomad tent and
make life unbearable for them.

01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:23.637
There is no other way.

01:13:28.503 --> 01:13:29.803
The dishes are ready.

01:13:30.337 --> 01:13:33.337
I was going to eat my brain from hunger.

01:13:33.803 --> 01:13:35.737
Brother, have you a brain to eat?

01:13:38.537 --> 01:13:40.237
-Brother Dogan.
-Yes, brother?

01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:45.603
Alright, I do not have brain.
You do, but you have not a mind.

01:13:47.737 --> 01:13:51.703
-Are the brain and mind different?
-Yes, brother, they are.

01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:53.937
You have not had your share of it.

01:13:58.037 --> 01:14:01.637
Brother, we sent you off to train Alps

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:04.703
you became a leech, wonderful.

01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:07.803
That is tutelage, brother.

01:14:09.503 --> 01:14:11.337
The tutelage is something different.

01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:14.603
Brother, the tutelage is
something different.

01:14:18.403 --> 01:14:21.503
Ertugrul can never be in such a betrayal.

01:14:22.337 --> 01:14:25.003
I want two nomad groups' Beys
to be one heart.

01:14:25.537 --> 01:14:29.403
No one shall think my nephew is a traitor.

01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:32.037
That is why I will join the headquarters.

01:14:43.737 --> 01:14:46.003
Ertugrul is more dangerous
than we thought.

01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:49.303
He has many fellow, including
Sultan in the palace.

01:14:50.003 --> 01:14:51.803
Like he has his uncle in marquee.

01:14:52.537 --> 01:14:55.870
He is calamity alive,
he is more calamity, dead.

01:14:57.237 --> 01:14:58.770
It will be hard.

01:15:35.403 --> 01:15:36.537
What happened, son?

01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:39.537
I have no one left, Artuk Bey.

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:45.270
First, my mother and my father.
Then my brothers.

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:51.003
And now, Ertugrul Bey, Wild Demir,
Dogan and Brother Turgut.

01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:56.437
Son, they will come back honorably.
Do not worry.

01:15:57.037 --> 01:16:00.370
What if they do not come back?
What if I become an orphan again?

01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:02.437
Do not worry about it, son.

01:16:03.337 --> 01:16:05.370
God turns the evil to benevolence.

01:16:05.837 --> 01:16:11.670
You will see Ertugrul Bey will come
to be relative for orphans.

01:16:12.603 --> 01:16:17.037
Not just you, all oppressed migrants.

01:16:31.037 --> 01:16:32.603
<i>Mother, is there permission to come in?</i>

01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:34.570
Come in, son.

01:16:37.503 --> 01:16:38.670
What is the matter, son?

01:16:43.437 --> 01:16:47.470
Mother, you do not lie to me, I know.

01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:50.237
Yet you do not tell the truth.

01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:53.670
What are you talking about, son?

01:16:53.803 --> 01:16:56.637
Halime and Wild Demir are not here.

01:16:57.970 --> 01:17:01.503
You know where they are
but you do not tell me.

01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:04.037
That offends me, mother.

01:17:05.637 --> 01:17:07.403
They went to Sultan Aleaddin.

01:17:09.337 --> 01:17:12.803
They left to take Sultan
the confidential papers of his state.

01:17:14.537 --> 01:17:18.303
And they will tell the trap
which was set up for Ertugrul.

01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:21.970
Mother, where did this paper come from?

01:17:24.503 --> 01:17:29.470
I do not know where it came from
but I know who it came from.

01:17:31.503 --> 01:17:32.503
From whom?

01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:39.637
From the one I never believed he died...

01:17:42.237 --> 01:17:45.570
...one I always said
would come back to us...

01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:50.637
...from Sungurtekin.

01:17:56.437 --> 01:17:57.603
Sungurtekin?

01:17:59.337 --> 01:18:01.937
-My brother, Sungurtekin?
-Yes.

01:18:03.703 --> 01:18:05.270
Mother, he is still alive?

01:18:06.603 --> 01:18:10.770
He is alive and he will come back
here one day.

01:18:12.937 --> 01:18:14.437
If God permits.

01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:25.270
The drums are beating
for the headquarters.

01:18:26.037 --> 01:18:28.670
We will talk later at length.
We need to go.

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.003
Wait a minute, mother.

01:18:32.903 --> 01:18:34.037
Ertugrul.

01:18:34.903 --> 01:18:36.970
Where does he get these news from, mother?

01:18:38.303 --> 01:18:40.870
Erzurum is cold and deserted.

01:18:42.803 --> 01:18:45.770
Which crane ends an urgent message
to him on these mountains?

01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:49.770
Mother, what is my brother doing?

01:18:58.537 --> 01:19:01.837
-Ertugrul Bey cannot be in a betrayal.
-How he could do this?

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:04.603
He cannot betray.

01:20:03.703 --> 01:20:05.970
In God's name, the compassionate
and the merciful.

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:10.270
With 99 names of God Almighty.

01:20:12.603 --> 01:20:15.803
Beys, dark clouds are upon us.

01:20:16.437 --> 01:20:18.303
I wanted to talk the matter

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:23.737
with my headquarters' Beys
and find a solution.

01:20:26.603 --> 01:20:28.603
Go ahead, have your say.

01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:34.270
Our biggest matter is Ertugrul who
does not know custom and settle down.

01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:36.370
He is still not found.

01:20:36.637 --> 01:20:39.470
-Is that right, Beys?
-It is true.

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:44.737
I am scared that we will fall victim
to Sultan Aleaddin's wrath

01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:47.337
who would save us from Mongols.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:52.737
It seems that Ertugrul went to earth, Bey.

01:20:53.503 --> 01:20:57.803
It is obvious that he is running away
from the mores and the justice of Sultan.

01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:04.237
My brother fights by advancing on,
not by running away.

01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:08.837
Gundogdu, he fights with whom?

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:13.937
First, he rioted against
Tugtekin Bey, then Seljuk's.

01:21:14.737 --> 01:21:16.270
Is this his fight?

01:21:16.903 --> 01:21:19.037
Right.

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:26.670
Are you talking about Ertugrul Bey
who took his life in his hands...

01:21:28.537 --> 01:21:34.703
...and fought with Templars,
Mongols all this time?

01:21:37.837 --> 01:21:40.470
These words are told with
courage of ignorance.

01:21:41.837 --> 01:21:44.903
That is true. We acted foolishly
and did all we could

01:21:45.237 --> 01:21:49.003
to unite two nomad groups.
We shared our daily bread.

01:21:51.637 --> 01:21:56.937
Also, we shared our mattress.
We slept on land, cold and muddy.

01:21:57.837 --> 01:22:02.570
So our brother, Kayis would not get hurt.
We shared everything

01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:06.803
so their wounds would scab
and they can start over again.

01:22:08.003 --> 01:22:11.903
-What did we get? Nothing.
-That is true.

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:15.870
Ertugrul is a traitor.
Do you not see that?

01:22:16.037 --> 01:22:19.737
-What are you talking about?
-That is a lie.

01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:29.570
We returned from war with Mongols...

01:22:31.003 --> 01:22:33.237
...when Ertugrul was born.

01:22:34.737 --> 01:22:36.803
Suleyman Shah was seriously wounded.

01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:40.437
I commended him to Artuk.

01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:42.603
He was unconscious.

01:22:44.237 --> 01:22:47.570
I did not tell Hayme
so she would not be scattered.

01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:52.437
I said he is healthy and
he is on the way, he is coming.

01:22:53.670 --> 01:22:56.003
While Hayme was bringing
Ertugrul into the world

01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:59.037
Suleyman Shah was facing death.

01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:06.270
I took Ertugrul on my lap
after his mother.

01:23:07.037 --> 01:23:09.570
I took him to Artuk Bey's tent of healing.

01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:12.670
I laid him on his wounded father's bed.

01:23:13.603 --> 01:23:15.003
I did so...

01:23:17.803 --> 01:23:22.603
...he would know his father's scent
in case he died.

01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:35.270
Ertugrul touched his father's face
with his tiny hands.

01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:40.003
Suleyman Shah got refreshed.

01:23:43.537 --> 01:23:49.503
He prayed and rendered thanks
to God Almighty, and said to his son

01:23:50.670 --> 01:23:57.403
"May your tiny hands that enlivened your
father, be the cure for Oghuz's wound.

01:24:00.603 --> 01:24:03.770
May your sharp eyes that looks like
Prophet Ali's sword, Zulfiqar

01:24:05.303 --> 01:24:07.337
lead the way for Oghuz.

01:24:08.603 --> 01:24:13.403
Even if all world comes down on you,
do not give up your path, son."

01:24:18.503 --> 01:24:21.803
Ertugrul is a son, faithful
to his father's wish.

01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:24.770
I have known it for ages.

01:24:26.037 --> 01:24:28.470
Ertugrul is not a traitor!

01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:36.370
And now, today, too, I know

01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:39.037
even if all the world comes down on him

01:24:39.903 --> 01:24:41.937
Ertugrul will do what is necessary.

01:24:52.937 --> 01:24:54.003
He is right.

01:25:01.703 --> 01:25:03.370
Thank you, Korkut Bey.

01:25:04.837 --> 01:25:08.270
I wish to God Almighty,
that you are right.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:10.403
And Ertugrul is innocent.

01:25:11.037 --> 01:25:14.670
The soldier who got wounded in the battle
was wrong in his words.

01:25:14.737 --> 01:25:15.770
If God permits.

01:25:30.195 --> 01:25:32.295
Bey, Kocabash wants to attend
the headquarters.

01:25:32.429 --> 01:25:35.029
He is wounded and he says
he has something to say to Beys.

01:25:35.195 --> 01:25:37.995
-He asks for permission.
-Let him come in.

01:25:59.829 --> 01:26:00.862
Kocabash?

01:26:03.662 --> 01:26:05.662
Look at you, what happened?

01:26:08.995 --> 01:26:13.062
Ertugrul Bey has attacked us
with his Alps, Bey.

01:26:14.029 --> 01:26:16.829
-It is impossible!
-It is unbelievable!

01:26:17.062 --> 01:26:21.662
Bastard's seed! Do you know
what you are saying?

01:26:22.329 --> 01:26:26.195
I say what I saw. They did this to me.

01:26:28.362 --> 01:26:30.729
Do you want an evidence?
That is the evidence.

01:26:30.962 --> 01:26:34.062
-That is the evidence.
-Betrayers!

01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:39.295
Well, what about Tugtekin? Where is he?

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.662
Bey, last time I saw him,
he fought like lions.

01:26:44.929 --> 01:26:46.695
Then I saw that he was gravely wounded.

01:26:47.362 --> 01:26:50.729
I lost my consciousness.

01:26:52.062 --> 01:26:54.829
There were many dead bodies
when I opened my eyes.

01:26:55.895 --> 01:26:58.329
But I could not find Tugtekin Bey
although I looked for him.

01:26:59.195 --> 01:27:02.162
Lie! You are lying, are you not?

01:27:02.362 --> 01:27:05.162
-Bey!
-Korkut Bey!

01:27:05.995 --> 01:27:08.295
-Brother!
-Bey!

01:27:08.962 --> 01:27:10.429
Bey! Are you alright?

01:27:14.095 --> 01:27:18.029
Damned be the day you came
to my nomad tent.

01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:23.362
Get out of here right now!

01:27:24.195 --> 01:27:27.329
-Shame on you!
-You all are betrayers!

01:27:27.795 --> 01:27:30.295
-You are betrayers!
-Get out of here!

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:34.195
-Betrayers!
-You all are betrayers!

01:27:54.329 --> 01:27:56.995
Gather a search unit right now!

01:27:57.962 --> 01:28:01.695
And they shall not return before
they find Tugtekin, alive or dead.

01:28:22.305 --> 01:28:24.039
Traitors.

01:28:24.405 --> 01:28:25.972
Where did they come from?

01:28:32.339 --> 01:28:33.939
Why did they come?

01:28:34.605 --> 01:28:36.472
He is right.

01:28:45.831 --> 01:28:49.997
Now the pitcher is full. May God help us.

01:28:50.864 --> 01:28:52.397
How could they do this?

01:28:53.397 --> 01:28:54.931
They betrayed us.

01:30:32.531 --> 01:30:33.764
Blood.

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:37.197
I am surrounded by blood.

01:30:45.164 --> 01:30:47.731
Would it clean all this blood
covered in my hands

01:30:48.797 --> 01:30:51.231
if I was washed in the river of Selenge?

01:30:54.797 --> 01:30:56.997
Or the lustful water of Ulungur River?

01:30:58.931 --> 01:31:00.197
Or Yenisey River?

01:31:03.431 --> 01:31:05.264
If they come together
and pour to my hand...

01:31:07.164 --> 01:31:09.364
...could they clean this much blood,
Ulubilge?

01:31:21.264 --> 01:31:23.531
I claimed many brave men's lives today.

01:31:28.831 --> 01:31:32.131
How it hurts me. How it burns me.

01:31:38.397 --> 01:31:39.731
Tell me, Ulubilge.

01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:44.264
How many more lives of brave Alps
will I take?

01:31:45.864 --> 01:31:47.164
When will this pain end?

01:31:49.064 --> 01:31:52.497
We gave them the universe.

01:31:56.531 --> 01:31:57.731
That is true.

01:31:59.497 --> 01:32:01.231
We gave them the universe.

01:32:02.231 --> 01:32:04.864
We wanted them to become one
with their brothers, Mongols

01:32:05.431 --> 01:32:08.131
and reach the blessings of universe.

01:32:09.164 --> 01:32:14.797
Certainly, brave men will come out
from them like Hamza and Abdurrahman.

01:32:16.231 --> 01:32:20.031
They will be fellows for our way
and be wind for our swords.

01:32:23.397 --> 01:32:25.964
We are going to conquer the universe
with Oghuz brothers.

01:32:29.031 --> 01:32:33.764
But until that day,
they will follow their fool

01:32:34.897 --> 01:32:38.431
insolent Bey and fight each other.

01:32:43.064 --> 01:32:46.864
-Hamza, is that right?
-You are right, Baycu Noyan.

01:32:47.397 --> 01:32:49.531
Neither our Alps nor people
will find peace

01:32:49.797 --> 01:32:55.064
before those who sit on both
nomad groups' marquees go to hell.

01:32:55.997 --> 01:32:57.164
What about you?

01:32:59.397 --> 01:33:04.131
What do you think, Abdurrahman?
You are staying silent.

01:33:05.064 --> 01:33:11.231
Ertugrul is the killer of
Tugtekin Bey and Alps...

01:33:14.331 --> 01:33:18.531
...not just Ertokus and
Seljuk troops anymore.

01:33:28.397 --> 01:33:29.864
Tell us, Abdurrahman.

01:33:31.064 --> 01:33:34.997
What Kayi Alps are doing now?
Whom do they obey?

01:33:36.264 --> 01:33:39.297
Mother Hayme or Korkut Bey?

01:33:54.297 --> 01:33:56.131
Just as you wanted, Bancu Noyan.

01:33:58.397 --> 01:34:00.264
Ertugrul's head will be cut.

01:34:03.964 --> 01:34:07.031
From now on, Kayi and Dodurga tribes

01:34:07.764 --> 01:34:12.231
will either drown in each other's blood
or they will submit to you.

01:34:13.297 --> 01:34:14.964
There is no other way.

01:34:16.331 --> 01:34:20.764
They will fight on your side,
while you conquer the universe.

01:34:51.964 --> 01:34:56.031
Now, Tugtekin is painting in
glowing colors in the tent

01:34:56.164 --> 01:34:57.797
how he chased us.

01:34:59.197 --> 01:35:02.964
He should be thankful to Bey. Otherwise
we would bury them in the ground.

01:35:07.331 --> 01:35:09.231
If our hands had their blood

01:35:09.497 --> 01:35:12.197
we would not be able to return
to the nomad tent.

01:35:19.031 --> 01:35:20.397
Bey, what will we do now?

01:35:22.097 --> 01:35:26.431
Kocabash's treason will end.
This will end, one way or another.

01:35:37.197 --> 01:35:38.264
Enjoy your supper.

01:35:40.894 --> 01:35:44.594
-Bey, please, join us.
-I am short on time, Beys.

01:35:44.794 --> 01:35:47.127
-I have news for you.
-I hope nothing is wrong, Artuk Bey.

01:35:48.794 --> 01:35:49.994
Tugtekin Bey died.

01:36:08.427 --> 01:36:10.094
How did that happen?

01:36:10.394 --> 01:36:13.794
Kocabash told that you
and your Alps killed him.

01:36:50.161 --> 01:36:51.561
Tugtekin.

01:36:53.461 --> 01:36:54.461
Tugtekin.

01:37:05.394 --> 01:37:08.361
Tugtekin. My son.

01:38:03.694 --> 01:38:04.827
Duru.

01:38:33.127 --> 01:38:35.427
Bey. Korkut Bey.

01:38:36.594 --> 01:38:39.761
Please, pull yourself together. Bey.

01:38:41.861 --> 01:38:45.561
Bey. It is me, Aytolun.
Look, I am with you.

01:39:04.394 --> 01:39:06.727
Aytolun, we are paying
the price of our sins.

01:39:11.161 --> 01:39:14.861
First my wife, then my son
paid the price...

01:39:16.761 --> 01:39:18.627
...of our illicit relationship.

01:39:22.661 --> 01:39:24.094
Now, it is my turn.

01:39:26.494 --> 01:39:29.527
I know. It is my turn.

01:39:30.394 --> 01:39:34.927
I believe Tugtekin did not die, Bey.
You will see, he will come back.

01:39:36.594 --> 01:39:41.761
Do not do that. Dodurgas
want to see their Bey well.

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:43.961
Do not do that.

01:39:46.594 --> 01:39:48.761
Kayi tribe will get out from
this nomad tent, tomorrow.

01:39:49.461 --> 01:39:51.894
Kayi tribe is going to get out from
this nomad tent, tomorrow.

01:39:53.661 --> 01:39:55.827
Now, I do not want them here.

01:39:58.061 --> 01:40:00.394
After this, it is impossible.

01:40:02.027 --> 01:40:03.460
It shall not be.

01:40:09.527 --> 01:40:11.161
After this it is impossible.

01:40:21.627 --> 01:40:24.027
I am here because I believe
you would not do it.

01:40:24.794 --> 01:40:27.794
But no one else believes it, except me.

01:40:32.127 --> 01:40:34.794
If you do not take action
within a short time

01:40:35.161 --> 01:40:37.394
the nomad tent will turn into bloodbath.

01:40:42.561 --> 01:40:44.894
-Did they find his body?
-No.

01:40:49.627 --> 01:40:52.361
Mongols wanted to kill him
and calumniate me.

01:40:55.694 --> 01:40:57.894
Satan will try to wangle.

01:40:58.494 --> 01:41:01.694
Now every step you take
holds great importance.

01:41:05.661 --> 01:41:07.827
-I shall go.
-Thank you, Artuk Bey.

01:41:08.561 --> 01:41:10.727
-I will never forget your kindness.
-Thank you.

01:41:12.027 --> 01:41:13.527
Do not get up.

01:41:21.061 --> 01:41:22.527
Maybe he is alive.

01:41:25.461 --> 01:41:26.761
We are going to look for him.

01:41:28.161 --> 01:41:29.494
Get ready for it.

01:41:29.561 --> 01:41:32.027
-All right, Bey.
-All right.

01:41:45.361 --> 01:41:50.427
All our Alps are going to keep watch
with swords, all night long.

01:41:55.361 --> 01:41:57.361
Mother, everything could happen
after this.

01:42:01.794 --> 01:42:03.161
We cannot stay here.

01:42:05.827 --> 01:42:10.094
If Alps of two nomad group
try to kill each other

01:42:10.627 --> 01:42:12.394
it would be catastrophy.

01:42:16.761 --> 01:42:18.694
We need to leave here
within a short time.

01:42:19.561 --> 01:42:21.994
Otherwise, we could not answer
for it in afterlife.

01:42:28.561 --> 01:42:30.827
I found out where Ertugrul is.

01:42:32.161 --> 01:42:33.594
Go and bring him alive.

01:42:35.894 --> 01:42:41.161
I will go and put pressure on
this ignoble Kocabash.

01:43:18.827 --> 01:43:21.927
Mother? Where are you going at this hour?

01:43:22.461 --> 01:43:25.561
-I am going to talk to Korkut Bey.
-Mother, what are you saying?

01:43:26.161 --> 01:43:28.961
Alps are angry, one of them
might do something bad.

01:43:29.061 --> 01:43:32.827
-You cannot go there alone.
-All Alps are my son.

01:43:33.794 --> 01:43:36.961
They lost their Bey,
I know the pain they feel.

01:43:39.394 --> 01:43:40.927
But do not worry about me.

01:44:18.427 --> 01:44:22.827
Where have you been, Artuk Bey?
Alps are looking for you everywhere.

01:44:25.961 --> 01:44:28.061
I am sorry, Aytolun Hatun.

01:44:28.394 --> 01:44:30.761
There was a fevered patient
and I went to treat him.

01:44:31.727 --> 01:44:33.561
I wish you have informed us.

01:44:36.427 --> 01:44:39.527
Anyway, begin to treat right away.

01:44:50.461 --> 01:44:51.461
Bey?

01:44:55.894 --> 01:44:58.661
Aytolun, stop Korkut before
he does something crazy.

01:44:59.027 --> 01:45:00.927
I do not care if he dies or not.

01:45:01.727 --> 01:45:03.961
In fact, his death might serve
my purpose more.

01:45:05.094 --> 01:45:09.161
A civil war would make me an unskilled man
in Aleaddin's eyes

01:45:09.427 --> 01:45:11.794
-and everything will be over.
-I gave him medicine.

01:45:11.994 --> 01:45:13.661
He will sleep all night long.

01:45:14.527 --> 01:45:17.594
But these medicines would
harm him, brother.

01:45:17.761 --> 01:45:21.961
If the need arises, put him to sleep
for keeps, just put him to sleep.

01:45:23.027 --> 01:45:27.061
You know, I would do it. Be sure of it.

01:45:31.494 --> 01:45:32.661
What does he say?

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:36.561
He will send off Kayi tribe
from his marquee.

01:45:37.427 --> 01:45:41.527
Miserable! He will ruin the only
right thing he did in life.

01:45:48.461 --> 01:45:49.927
Bey, Mother Hayme is here.

01:45:55.961 --> 01:45:57.094
Invite her in.

01:46:03.827 --> 01:46:05.994
Do not break ties with her.

01:46:06.594 --> 01:46:08.961
-Talk to her carefully.
-Do not worry.

01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:22.427
I want to see my brother.

01:46:26.394 --> 01:46:30.027
He is not himself. He has a fever
and talks in his sleep.

01:46:34.427 --> 01:46:36.561
We need to be thankful for it,
Hayme Hatun.

01:46:36.994 --> 01:46:39.961
If he regains consciousness,
it would be catastrophe for all of us.

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:44.361
He lost his son, I am scared he will do
something crazy out of his pain.

01:46:45.661 --> 01:46:49.527
You need to know that I hardly keep down
Korkut Bey, Alps and the people

01:46:49.594 --> 01:46:51.961
in the absence of Tugtekin.

01:46:52.027 --> 01:46:53.627
Thank you, Gumustekin.

01:46:54.694 --> 01:46:55.927
You are doing the right thing.

01:46:56.861 --> 01:47:00.127
The truth will show up itself
early or late.

01:47:01.827 --> 01:47:05.361
Then we must be able to
look at each other's faces.

01:47:08.627 --> 01:47:10.561
What does Artuk say about
my brother's condition?

01:47:10.727 --> 01:47:13.461
He is concerned that Korkut Bey
will not make it to the morning.

01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:20.527
If Ertugrul causes his death, too
and not just his son...

01:47:22.994 --> 01:47:26.161
...we would all drown in the blood
that would be shed, Hayme.

01:48:42.861 --> 01:48:44.127
Do not.

01:48:48.361 --> 01:48:49.927
Tell them to go out.

01:48:54.794 --> 01:48:55.894
Tell them!

01:48:56.827 --> 01:48:57.927
Go out.

01:49:25.161 --> 01:49:27.394
You saved my life.

01:49:27.927 --> 01:49:32.027
But you believe your brother's words
instead of mine.

01:49:50.461 --> 01:49:51.827
Ertugrul did this.

01:49:53.394 --> 01:49:57.761
Turgut, Dogan, Bamsi and a looney man
called Wild Demir were with him.

01:49:59.527 --> 01:50:02.061
They entrapped and hunted us one by one.

01:50:05.827 --> 01:50:07.761
How did you run away from them?

01:50:11.027 --> 01:50:12.427
It was difficult.

01:50:15.027 --> 01:50:16.727
Well, how did Ertugrul...

01:50:17.661 --> 01:50:21.161
...fight with Tugtekin
with a wounded hand?

01:50:23.127 --> 01:50:25.394
Bey, first they shot arrows.

01:50:27.561 --> 01:50:29.494
Then he fought with Ertugrul.

01:50:31.061 --> 01:50:34.094
He took advantage from his wounded
hands and managed to run away.

01:50:37.061 --> 01:50:38.727
I hope he is alive.

01:50:39.727 --> 01:50:42.361
He would come and you can hear
everything from him.

01:50:43.594 --> 01:50:44.861
I hope so.

01:50:51.094 --> 01:50:55.494
We need to find Tugtekin, alive or dead.

01:50:57.361 --> 01:51:00.127
I will take the road with Alps
who traces by far the best.

01:51:02.794 --> 01:51:03.927
I shall come with you.

01:51:04.761 --> 01:51:05.794
I shall come with you, Bey.

01:51:08.627 --> 01:51:11.694
You stay here, you have no strength left.

01:51:13.027 --> 01:51:14.827
Where did this happen?

01:51:16.594 --> 01:51:18.827
Bey, what if they do something to you?

01:51:22.894 --> 01:51:26.394
I would not even allow
their bodies to be buried

01:51:27.361 --> 01:51:29.894
I would make them a prey for wolves.

01:51:31.761 --> 01:51:33.827
Tell me, where were you?

01:51:36.361 --> 01:51:37.994
In Kurtbogaz.

01:51:58.761 --> 01:52:00.161
Gazelle eyed.

01:52:01.661 --> 01:52:03.594
We are in the way of no return.

01:52:04.594 --> 01:52:06.594
Be ready as if you can go to Konya
any moment.

01:52:12.494 --> 01:52:13.894
Do not worry about me.

01:52:15.594 --> 01:52:19.627
Now that I am on the road with you,
I would take if it is death or life.

01:52:30.361 --> 01:52:31.861
If I do not return...

01:52:33.527 --> 01:52:35.961
...if our baby is a boy,
raise him like an Alp.

01:52:38.561 --> 01:52:40.427
He will undulate the flag I left.

01:52:41.561 --> 01:52:43.561
Do not worry yourself, Bey.

01:53:06.594 --> 01:53:07.694
Bey.

01:53:18.394 --> 01:53:21.594
Take care of my wife and child, master.

01:53:27.161 --> 01:53:28.794
Do not worry, Bey.

01:53:30.861 --> 01:53:33.927
I would die than to give them.

01:53:36.927 --> 01:53:38.861
May your path be bright, Bey.

01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:58.461
Alps! Listen my words carefully.

01:53:59.494 --> 01:54:03.794
None of us will sit here and
wait for Tugtekin Bey.

01:54:04.594 --> 01:54:07.894
The truth will show itself.
There is no other way.

01:54:09.494 --> 01:54:12.861
We will either eat each other
like hungry dogs

01:54:13.894 --> 01:54:17.927
or slit our enemies' throat like wolves.

01:54:20.461 --> 01:54:23.527
There is no other way. Now

01:54:24.527 --> 01:54:27.761
if it comes to light that
my brother did it

01:54:28.394 --> 01:54:34.161
I will not wait for the justice
of Seljuk or your rightful rage.

01:54:35.827 --> 01:54:38.661
I will kill him with my own hands.

01:54:41.461 --> 01:54:48.394
That is why we need to find Tugtekin,
right away.

01:54:49.594 --> 01:54:52.561
Let us pray to God to find him alive.

01:54:53.161 --> 01:54:55.961
And peace to come to our nomad tent.

01:55:07.427 --> 01:55:10.361
-What is it, Bey?
-I am going to come with you.

01:55:11.161 --> 01:55:12.994
I will not leave you alone at this hour.

01:55:14.161 --> 01:55:15.494
Thank you, Bey.

01:55:17.427 --> 01:55:20.094
Alps! In God's name.

01:55:54.994 --> 01:55:55.994
Bey.

01:55:57.661 --> 01:55:59.761
It is dawn but we had not
found a trace yet.

01:56:01.694 --> 01:56:03.694
It seems like he went to earth.

01:56:44.627 --> 01:56:46.894
You know, it saddens me
to tell you this

01:56:47.427 --> 01:56:50.561
but you brother has become an
incorrigible highwayman, Gundogdu.

01:56:52.461 --> 01:56:55.061
If you restrained him at the time
all these would not happen.

01:56:55.127 --> 01:56:56.494
God give me pasions.

01:56:56.694 --> 01:57:01.961
Bey, above all, we shall find Tugtekin.
Then we will talk about my brother.

01:57:03.161 --> 01:57:04.494
I will look this way.

01:57:17.494 --> 01:57:18.560
Go ahead.

01:57:19.861 --> 01:57:20.894
Go ahead.

01:57:28.627 --> 01:57:29.661
Scatter around.

01:59:20.927 --> 01:59:23.727
-Brother?
-Ertugrul, where have you been?

01:59:24.461 --> 01:59:25.994
How could you kill Tugtekin?

01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:28.961
I did not, brother.

01:59:30.361 --> 01:59:32.994
Speak slowly. They are looking
for him everywhere.

01:59:34.161 --> 01:59:36.427
I set a trap for Mongols through Kocabash.

01:59:37.127 --> 01:59:39.994
But Tugtekin has learned it
from Gokce and came.

01:59:40.894 --> 01:59:42.094
He wanted to fight.

01:59:42.894 --> 01:59:45.694
When I did not want to fight,
he chased me.

01:59:47.427 --> 01:59:48.761
Mongols killed him.

01:59:49.027 --> 01:59:51.427
Ertugrul, what trouble you brought on us?

01:59:52.061 --> 01:59:55.694
I believe you but how will you
convince others?

02:00:01.594 --> 02:00:04.661
Brother, Kocabash is a traitor.
The trap was set up by him.

02:00:04.961 --> 02:00:08.594
As long as you have this set of mind,
many trouble will come to us.

02:00:11.694 --> 02:00:13.527
Return to the nomad tent.

02:00:13.794 --> 02:00:15.994
-Let them adjudge you.
-Not now.

02:00:16.761 --> 02:00:18.894
I will bring you to nomad tent
with my own hands.

02:00:31.394 --> 02:00:32.527
Gundogdu!

02:00:36.461 --> 02:00:37.894
Ertugrul, surrender.

02:01:00.094 --> 02:01:01.361
You, go on.

02:01:08.127 --> 02:01:09.361
Gundogdu!

02:01:12.727 --> 02:01:13.794
Gundogdu?

02:01:28.761 --> 02:01:30.161
There is no trace, Bey.

02:01:32.027 --> 02:01:34.927
Do not tire yourself.
We shall return to nomad tent.

02:07:18.801 --> 02:07:21.101
Wild Demir, we shall take the road
as soon as possible.

02:07:21.435 --> 02:07:25.201
Our horses are brave, we will fly
like birds. Do not worry, daughter.

02:07:30.935 --> 02:07:33.535
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, welcome.

02:07:34.201 --> 02:07:35.501
Welcome, Sheikh.

02:07:53.968 --> 02:07:57.768
You are always ready to fight. God bless.

02:07:57.835 --> 02:07:59.135
Thank you, Sheikh.

02:07:59.335 --> 02:08:03.435
But the enemy does not get off our back.
So we cannot leave our swords.

02:08:05.801 --> 02:08:07.768
Sheikh, please, sit down.

02:08:12.268 --> 02:08:13.401
In God's name.

02:08:17.368 --> 02:08:19.801
We sent off Ertugrul to fight with enemy.

02:08:20.868 --> 02:08:23.035
But it has been a long time
and he did not come back yet.

02:08:29.001 --> 02:08:30.801
Enemies are like Satan.

02:08:33.901 --> 02:08:34.935
How?

02:08:37.801 --> 02:08:40.268
Who helps the most
to make a man single hearted

02:08:40.768 --> 02:08:45.001
to make a man one of
God's faithful servants?

02:08:50.901 --> 02:08:52.435
It is the Satan.

02:08:56.068 --> 02:09:00.901
The greatest helper to make a man
single-hearted is Satan.

02:09:01.268 --> 02:09:06.001
Because if a man does not fight
with the devil and his desires

02:09:06.801 --> 02:09:10.868
he cannot be single-hearted.
He cannot reach the true faith.

02:09:12.801 --> 02:09:16.268
Satan, who believes himself
to be the wisest entity

02:09:16.535 --> 02:09:19.735
trains his sight on a man and attacks.

02:09:20.868 --> 02:09:23.501
He thinks he will mislead a man.

02:09:24.435 --> 02:09:29.801
But actually, he is working day and night
so that man can be single-hearted.

02:09:31.001 --> 02:09:34.468
Even if the Satan tries to mislead a man

02:09:35.768 --> 02:09:38.101
a single-hearted man
would not buckle under him.

02:09:38.535 --> 02:09:40.268
He would not yield to temptation.

02:09:40.868 --> 02:09:43.301
And while he does not yield,
his faith gets stronger

02:09:43.801 --> 02:09:48.101
his purity becomes more fertile.
The enemy is like Satan.

02:09:49.168 --> 02:09:52.968
He keeps working to make a hero
of the man he thinks of killing

02:09:53.068 --> 02:09:55.235
but does not realize that.

02:09:57.501 --> 02:10:02.235
Daughter Halime, May God
ordain strong faith for us.

02:10:03.535 --> 02:10:08.101
May he give us the will to fight
with enemy and Satan.

02:10:09.135 --> 02:10:11.835
May he give us mind.
May he give us heart.

02:10:12.101 --> 02:10:14.235
-Amen.
-Amen.

02:10:15.068 --> 02:10:18.435
Well said, my Sheikh.
May God strengthen your heart.

02:10:19.301 --> 02:10:21.368
-Amen.
-Amen.

02:10:22.968 --> 02:10:26.168
Dervish, look after the vestry.

02:10:26.501 --> 02:10:28.235
As you wish, Sheikh.

02:03:24.665 --> 02:03:27.731
Brother, soon, you will sit there.

02:03:30.331 --> 02:03:33.831
Aytolun, I do not care about
sitting on this stinky sheepskin...

02:03:33.965 --> 02:03:36.531
...in this felt tent and ruling.

02:03:44.598 --> 02:03:46.298
What do you say, brother?

02:03:47.065 --> 02:03:50.665
All our effort, all the blood we shed...

02:03:51.698 --> 02:03:53.265
What were they for?

02:03:57.631 --> 02:04:01.365
I saw in Konya that a new world
is being formed...

02:04:01.765 --> 02:04:05.798
...and nomads who follow their herds,
have no place in that new world.

02:04:06.931 --> 02:04:09.765
We shall not shield Seljuk,
Seljuk should shield us.

02:04:10.998 --> 02:04:15.998
It is time to find a home for ourselves
and take root on these fertile lands.

02:04:17.431 --> 02:04:19.731
If we cannot do it by any means...

02:04:20.065 --> 02:04:21.898
...this stinky sheepskin
would be our cerement...

02:04:22.065 --> 02:04:23.965
...the grass would be our grave...

02:04:24.265 --> 02:04:26.998
...and the winter quarters
would be our hell.

02:04:29.898 --> 02:04:33.065
Our destiny is in seigniories
in the infidel towns...

02:04:33.331 --> 02:04:35.365
...not in the tent of the nomad.

02:04:36.931 --> 02:04:42.965
We will either keep up with this world
or become the whores of Mongols.

02:04:44.631 --> 02:04:46.065
That is the matter.

02:04:51.665 --> 02:04:55.698
Ertugrul says that he did not do it and
he does not say anything else, mother.

02:04:58.465 --> 02:04:59.765
Kocabash!

02:05:04.265 --> 02:05:06.565
So him saving your life...

02:05:08.298 --> 02:05:10.631
...was a game to get closer to you.

02:05:12.598 --> 02:05:13.965
And he managed that, mother.

02:05:15.598 --> 02:05:17.731
I allowed Noyan's dog
to come into my tent.

02:05:20.698 --> 02:05:23.031
Who knows what else he has done
behind my back.

02:05:24.298 --> 02:05:25.765
While we are waiting for the war...

02:05:27.365 --> 02:05:31.598
...Noyan had already won it
and we were not even aware.

02:05:36.965 --> 02:05:39.765
So you finally came to
Ertugrul Bey's words.

02:05:41.065 --> 02:05:44.598
You wanted to lock him in the tribe
like an old woman...

02:05:44.698 --> 02:05:48.331
...using his wounded hand as an excuse,
from the beginning.

02:05:48.898 --> 02:05:52.698
The more he told you about the storm,
the more you tried to crush him.

02:05:52.865 --> 02:05:55.731
And when you could not do it,
you chased him out of the tribe.

02:05:56.265 --> 02:05:58.898
But the storm is
in the middle of the tribe.

02:05:59.565 --> 02:06:02.365
Tell me, what will you do now?

02:06:02.598 --> 02:06:04.731
-What will you do now?
-Selcan!

02:06:06.831 --> 02:06:07.998
Selcan is right.

02:06:13.031 --> 02:06:14.998
Ertugrul was proven right again.

02:06:18.865 --> 02:06:21.665
Mother, I do not know how we can solve it.

02:06:23.965 --> 02:06:25.965
Kocabash. Traitor!

02:06:27.931 --> 02:06:31.065
He is a traitor but how can we prove it?

02:06:32.365 --> 02:06:33.431
How?

02:06:38.998 --> 02:06:39.998
Mother.

02:06:42.365 --> 02:06:45.431
I placed the Alps in the front
and back of the marquee.

02:06:48.865 --> 02:06:50.331
What are you saying, son?

02:06:52.631 --> 02:06:55.365
Mother, Dodurga Alps are angry.

02:06:56.398 --> 02:06:58.298
This fire will burn both tribes.

02:07:04.598 --> 02:07:05.798
What was I supposed to do?

02:10:52.045 --> 02:10:55.514
We want the killer of our brain.
We want justice.

02:10:56.307 --> 02:10:59.708
 We want the killer of our Bey.
We want justice.

02:11:02.868 --> 02:11:06.269
 We want the killer of our Bey.
We want justice.

02:11:11.841 --> 02:11:15.242
 We want the killer of our Bey.
We want justice.

02:11:40.778 --> 02:11:42.145
If something happens to me...

02:11:43.712 --> 02:11:45.245
...take care of the tribe.

02:11:48.412 --> 02:11:53.845
Bey, if something happens to you,
we would be eager to come to your side.

02:12:01.878 --> 02:12:05.478
Then, come to my side after
I arrange the order there and all.

02:12:20.378 --> 02:12:21.512
Bey.

02:12:22.345 --> 02:12:24.412
Gundogdu Bey calls for you.

02:12:41.712 --> 02:12:46.112
If I cannot solve it, I will inform you.
Wait around the tribe.

02:12:48.012 --> 02:12:51.245
Are you ready to sacrifice yourself
for the future of the tribe?

02:12:51.378 --> 02:12:54.078
I set my heart to die
for the tribe and people.

02:12:54.845 --> 02:12:57.245
I am going to wait, today and tomorrow.

02:12:57.312 --> 02:13:00.912
But I want Kocabash to be punished
as he deserves.

02:13:01.145 --> 02:13:03.278
Do not worry about it,
he will be punished.

02:13:10.878 --> 02:13:12.145
Give me your blessing.

02:13:12.845 --> 02:13:13.878
We do.

02:13:15.212 --> 02:13:16.278
We do, Bey.

02:13:25.378 --> 02:13:28.512
Bey, allow us to come with you.

02:13:31.978 --> 02:13:35.112
One Ismail who will put his head under
the knife is enough, Brother Turgut.

02:13:39.912 --> 02:13:41.078
Do as I said.

02:14:03.178 --> 02:14:04.878
Brothers, do not forget.

02:14:05.478 --> 02:14:08.112
God is the biggest of the game breakers.

02:14:09.912 --> 02:14:11.112
Take care of yourselves.

02:14:20.478 --> 02:14:23.278
<i>Allahuakhbar.</i>

02:14:23.912 --> 02:14:29.912
<i>Allahuakhbar.</i>
