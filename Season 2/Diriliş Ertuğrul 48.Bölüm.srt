00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 48 will start after 12:13 min.

12:13.711 --> 12:17.711
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:18.878 --> 12:22.545
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:22.995 --> 12:25.995
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:47.617 --> 13:51.284
You experienced thrashing
not the victory, Noyan.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.317
I want to remind you that.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.117
If I experienced thrashing

13:58.084 --> 14:00.017
my head would already be taken, Kobek.

14:12.050 --> 14:13.617
<i>-God!</i>
 <i>-Help!</i>

14:17.484 --> 14:19.417
<i>Welcome to hell of Noyan, Ertugrul.</i>

14:20.617 --> 14:23.750
<i>-Who are you?</i>
 <i>-Demon of this hell.</i>

14:40.484 --> 14:42.184
<i>Welcome to world of Mongolians.</i>

14:52.784 --> 14:54.717
You would regret that you let me go.

14:56.150 --> 14:57.517
I will cause great death you all.

15:03.384 --> 15:05.684
Defeat that incites anger.

15:07.617 --> 15:09.317
Do not play with my fate.

15:54.117 --> 15:55.117
Bey.

15:56.117 --> 15:58.350
I should know that you
would not let Noyan go.

16:00.150 --> 16:02.617
And I should know that
you will wiggle, Wild Demir.

16:05.550 --> 16:06.717
The tracks are to Kervansaray.

16:08.317 --> 16:09.417
They took Noyan there.

16:10.517 --> 16:13.084
Do not worry. I will kill that dishonest.

16:14.284 --> 16:15.417
Now you go to the nomad tent.

16:15.984 --> 16:18.684
You go back and make so many zulfiqars
for so many valiants.

16:19.117 --> 16:20.784
Do not leave nomad tent alone.
-My Bey.

16:21.750 --> 16:23.484
If you excuse me, I would like to come.

16:26.017 --> 16:27.584
This is a way with no return, Wild Demir.

16:28.584 --> 16:29.584
My Bey.

16:31.484 --> 16:35.184
Is there any other way
to go to my daughter?

16:48.250 --> 16:49.317
Come along, brother.

17:27.084 --> 17:28.350
I hope nothing is wrong, Turgut brother?

17:30.317 --> 17:32.350
You wriggle like you ambushed.

17:36.450 --> 17:38.784
We undertook the load of fate
since birth, Bey.

17:40.650 --> 17:42.217
Does it leave us alone a second?

17:45.217 --> 17:47.117
Tell me your grievance and
I can undertake your load.

17:57.784 --> 17:58.984
This way also is ended, Bey.

18:01.650 --> 18:03.084
Where will we go now?

18:04.484 --> 18:06.384
What did it fall to our share
from this journey?

18:07.750 --> 18:09.584
It is like that this way
tired you, Turgut Brother.

18:11.617 --> 18:13.150
Let us take a little rest in the marquee.

18:14.350 --> 18:15.450
This is not the way, Bey.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.284
To not know what is in your mind
makes me tired.

18:21.084 --> 18:22.350
I sacrifice my life for you, Bey.

18:23.650 --> 18:25.417
We are in the way with you until death.

18:26.484 --> 18:32.184
But who told us that we should
take this road?

18:36.517 --> 18:39.184
Why is so important that
who told me that, Turgut brother?

18:42.350 --> 18:44.350
Since when what I told became
to be queried?

18:45.317 --> 18:48.084
Not at all, Bey. Not at all.

18:49.517 --> 18:54.250
I am just upset that I do not have the
same place in your heart and mind.

18:57.584 --> 19:00.017
You do not tell me any of
your secrets anymore, Bey.

19:07.984 --> 19:11.084
There is a time for everything,
Turgut brother. Just be patient.

19:13.650 --> 19:14.650
Just be patient.

19:20.317 --> 19:24.284
We should eat a little bit
and then I will go to Ahlat.

19:26.984 --> 19:28.117
Wait for me here.

19:30.450 --> 19:32.084
We wait for you for a lifetime, Bey.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.450
-Good luck.
-Thank you, Bey.

19:59.150 --> 20:02.184
The meal is prepared delicious, Bey.

20:25.650 --> 20:28.217
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, Bey.

20:31.617 --> 20:33.150
You are healed now, Abdurrahman.

20:34.017 --> 20:36.550
Thanks to you, Bey. May God bless you.

20:37.084 --> 20:39.684
You did not leave me alone for a second.
You healed me.

20:40.350 --> 20:42.450
Thank you. Godspeed.

20:44.317 --> 20:45.550
Praise be, Abdurrahman.

20:46.550 --> 20:48.050
Alps missed you very much.

20:48.584 --> 20:51.017
They want to see you in the education area
as soon as possible.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.784
With God's help, I will do that too, Bey.

20:55.084 --> 20:56.117
If God permits.

20:56.684 --> 20:57.684
Take it.

21:02.784 --> 21:03.784
Godspeed.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.084
Why are you distressed, Bey?

21:14.150 --> 21:17.150
I should not send Sungur alone
after Noyan.

21:19.117 --> 21:24.250
Bey, do you think that it would be
better, if you would send 500 Alps?

21:25.450 --> 21:27.250
You will be millstone round
Sungurtekin's neck.

21:28.450 --> 21:31.617
He did not go for a war. He went
to settle an account for a cruel.

21:33.017 --> 21:34.584
My brother did not want me beside him.

21:37.284 --> 21:39.717
Bey, you are the main Alp of
two nomad groups.

21:41.150 --> 21:43.517
It is unknown that what kind of way
is this and where it is going

21:43.717 --> 21:44.750
and where it ends.

21:45.784 --> 21:49.217
It is also possible that he will go
after Noyan to China.

21:51.517 --> 21:52.617
You are right, Artuk Bey.

21:53.784 --> 21:57.417
You are right but my mother is very bad.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.250
She is living the pain of separation

22:02.217 --> 22:04.217
without enjoying coming together
with her child.

22:06.484 --> 22:11.517
Bey, you had to release Noyan by
following the commands of the state.

22:12.784 --> 22:15.184
And Sungurtekin did what it
is necessary for his family.

22:16.417 --> 22:18.984
The rest is will of God.

22:19.550 --> 22:21.417
Do not devastate yourself.

22:25.450 --> 22:26.984
Thank you, Bey. Thank you.

22:52.284 --> 22:53.284
Sungurtekin.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.417
Where are you, son?

23:11.317 --> 23:13.550
Mother, I brought you water.

23:15.684 --> 23:16.750
Thank you, daughter.

23:33.217 --> 23:34.417
Do you have another request, mother?

23:41.217 --> 23:42.417
Ertugrul is in a place

23:44.250 --> 23:45.750
and Sungur is in another.

23:49.184 --> 23:51.050
Now, my two arms are broken.

23:52.550 --> 23:57.050
My two eyes, two ears and two livers.

23:58.550 --> 24:01.550
For God's sake, do not devastate
yourself like this anymore.

24:06.717 --> 24:10.217
A new trouble every day.
A new separation every day.

24:11.284 --> 24:14.650
God! A new pain comes

24:15.150 --> 24:19.584
before my breathe reaches to another.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.284
Everything is going to be
all right, mother.

24:23.450 --> 24:25.617
We have peace in our marquee
and we were not expecting that.

24:27.150 --> 24:29.217
Ertugrul and Sungurtekin Bey
will also come.

24:30.650 --> 24:33.350
Our nomad group will be in peace, mother.
Do not think about these anymore.

24:34.017 --> 24:35.117
Do not worry.

24:36.517 --> 24:37.517
Peace!

24:39.683 --> 24:41.217
How can peace come, daughter?

24:45.717 --> 24:47.517
Sometimes, I lose my hope.

24:50.317 --> 24:55.517
We share the same tribe with those
centipedes entering our tent

24:56.117 --> 24:57.450
and stealing the seal.

25:02.084 --> 25:06.017
Noyan went but the betrayal is not over.

25:08.050 --> 25:11.250
Mother, there are still people entering
our tribe and that you did not query.

25:13.417 --> 25:16.250
You said that you will not stop
following however it ends.

25:20.117 --> 25:21.250
Who do you mean, daughter?

25:23.117 --> 25:25.750
You said that you will query your brides
as your daughters, mother.

25:37.617 --> 25:39.050
Call Goncagul for me.

25:42.350 --> 25:43.617
I would like to listen her.

25:45.250 --> 25:46.350
Your wish is my command, mother.

26:27.384 --> 26:30.650
Do you seek for the sun of world Seljuk?

26:32.484 --> 26:36.417
With this rudeness and this wildness.

26:37.617 --> 26:38.650
What about you?

26:39.584 --> 26:42.084
When will you give up on being
a wife of palace?

26:48.550 --> 26:50.184
You want to dominate all over the world

26:51.717 --> 26:54.584
but you do not know
how to behave properly.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.217
What about you?

26:59.750 --> 27:01.684
What happened that you knew
how to behave properly?

27:03.417 --> 27:09.550
Your lands, blessed cities and
holy shrines are under control of us.

27:12.150 --> 27:15.484
Your corpses will be dispersed
like sands in desert.

27:16.450 --> 27:23.250
Only the endless curse of humankind
will remain.

27:23.717 --> 27:26.384
Stop it. Do not give me that!

27:27.384 --> 27:28.517
Tell me what you want.

27:38.217 --> 27:41.384
Noyan, if you pollute my table
with your saliva again

27:43.550 --> 27:46.750
unfortunately the taste of my good meal

27:48.250 --> 27:50.584
will be destroyed with your dirty blood.

29:25.084 --> 29:27.517
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

29:34.084 --> 29:36.050
Welcome, Ertugrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

29:37.417 --> 29:38.450
Thank you.

29:39.117 --> 29:41.350
I hope your journey was smooth.

29:42.617 --> 29:43.650
Thanks to God.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.484
I found everything that I want.

29:49.384 --> 29:50.717
We will not listen these, son.

29:53.484 --> 29:54.550
Who will listen then?

29:57.550 --> 29:58.550
Excuse us.

31:08.017 --> 31:10.650
Welcome, Ertugrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

31:13.350 --> 31:15.350
Tell me about your blessed journey.

31:16.050 --> 31:19.217
Tell me so I can hear what I want to hear

31:19.717 --> 31:23.650
for years from a valiant like you.

31:32.784 --> 31:34.050
Ah, Noyan, ah!

31:37.384 --> 31:39.450
What did Ertugrul do to you?

31:54.184 --> 31:55.184
Do not forget!

31:56.017 --> 31:57.617
Your life is still in my hand.

32:00.517 --> 32:02.084
Your Sultan will learn everything.

32:12.417 --> 32:14.217
Now, we will eat our meal properly.

32:22.150 --> 32:23.717
I will go and explain
the situation to Ogeday.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.417
Do not forget to tell him
that I saved you from death.

32:30.084 --> 32:32.450
I will convince him to come
with a big army.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.617
-What if he will not be convinced?
-Then I establish my own army and come.

32:36.417 --> 32:40.250
Do not underestimate Seljukian.
What if you met with a bigger army?

32:42.550 --> 32:45.117
Sultan Aleaddin is getting stronger
every day.

32:47.050 --> 32:48.084
What do you want?

32:56.117 --> 32:58.617
I will be the new sultan in Anatolia.

33:00.484 --> 33:01.717
And you will help me.

33:03.550 --> 33:07.717
I will ask for an army from you and Ogeday
when it is time.

33:30.750 --> 33:33.417
Above all. You become a sultan.

33:34.584 --> 33:36.984
If you become a sultan woe is us!

33:38.250 --> 33:39.617
The world becomes reversed!

33:44.584 --> 33:46.650
Do not lose your seriousness, Noyan.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.117
Do not get upset, Sadettin,
do not get upset.

33:51.284 --> 33:53.217
The army of Ogeday will be with you.

33:59.184 --> 34:00.684
I will go and take a rest.

34:02.017 --> 34:05.284
You do what is necessary
and then let me know that.

34:51.203 --> 34:53.770
There is a big crysis
on the Byzantine borderline.

34:54.570 --> 34:59.037
Non-Muslim people want to get
rid of the rulers that persecute them.

35:00.037 --> 35:04.303
They expect a mighty ruler that will bring
order to their fertile lands.

35:06.070 --> 35:07.103
Villagers are in a miserable condition.

35:08.870 --> 35:12.870
People lost their belief
to people who share their beliefs.

35:14.537 --> 35:18.703
Bandits who escape from justice
are being seen everywhere.

35:19.537 --> 35:25.637
And migrant Turks settled in there
struggle to survive.

35:28.070 --> 35:30.170
They cannot help people
that are being persecuted

35:31.237 --> 35:34.770
by Byzantine because they are not
able to solve their own matters.

35:36.737 --> 35:43.137
Briefly, you say
whoever rules these land with justice

35:43.903 --> 35:44.970
will gain power.

35:47.637 --> 35:51.337
Days of depression
strengthen a brave man's weapon.

35:52.737 --> 35:55.537
Opportunities are crystal clear.

35:56.003 --> 35:58.203
But nobody takes a look at them.

35:59.737 --> 36:02.170
The ones look at them, becomes prosperous.

36:04.803 --> 36:08.803
But it will be tedious to move
my nomad tent there.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.303
If I move my nomad tent there

36:14.670 --> 36:17.870
I will become the biggest enemy
of migrant Turks

36:18.870 --> 36:20.870
the local people and Byzantine.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.137
It is right.

36:24.770 --> 36:27.103
Wherever livelihood is limited
and people to be fed are plenty

36:27.637 --> 36:28.903
the battle is tough.

36:30.237 --> 36:34.037
Son, it is not only about Kayi.

36:35.603 --> 36:37.837
The people of Anatolia
and the Islamic world

36:38.137 --> 36:42.337
fight each other
instead of seeing the real enemy.

36:44.237 --> 36:47.270
Byzantine is on one side,
and Mongolia is on another.

36:48.537 --> 36:50.070
And we fight each other.

36:52.137 --> 36:53.203
What about traitors?

36:55.103 --> 36:59.537
These inglourious people
can only slow our struggle down.

37:04.803 --> 37:05.903
So, who are you, then?

37:07.537 --> 37:09.137
We are nobody, son.

37:11.170 --> 37:12.537
Only nobody.

37:13.103 --> 37:15.637
And we will be nobody forever.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.103
What about me?

37:21.770 --> 37:24.870
Is being comrade of nobody
not enough for you?

37:29.170 --> 37:30.170
Thank you, sir.

37:31.903 --> 37:32.903
Come on, son.

37:33.203 --> 37:36.237
Maybe moving your nomad tent
there will take years.

37:36.870 --> 37:38.803
But do not give up.

37:40.203 --> 37:44.303
When you have Byzantine as your only enemy
there will be plenty of friends for you.

37:45.837 --> 37:47.903
Do not worry about traitors.

37:48.837 --> 37:53.203
They will have the real torture in hell.

37:56.803 --> 38:00.070
So, it is for us to be determined,
not giving up.

38:04.003 --> 38:07.270
If God permits, I will do everything
in order to move my nomad tent

38:07.970 --> 38:09.203
to the Byzantine borderline.

38:10.237 --> 38:11.537
If God permits, son.

38:16.003 --> 38:17.870
He still sees himself
as the commander, right?

38:18.703 --> 38:20.137
After all, he is still the commander.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.103
To hell with him!

38:26.737 --> 38:27.870
Listen to me carefully.

38:28.537 --> 38:30.270
I will not only deliver you Noyan.

38:32.537 --> 38:34.170
Your rewards are not only these.

38:48.037 --> 38:50.537
I will also give you
the seal of Oghuz Khan.

38:52.903 --> 38:58.237
Take it to Ogeday personally,
and obtain whatever position you desire.

39:05.203 --> 39:07.203
I will never forget this favor.

39:11.670 --> 39:13.770
But there is a cost for every favor.

39:16.603 --> 39:17.770
The cost of this one is to tell Ogeday

39:18.703 --> 39:21.670
that the new sultan will be Sadettin Kobek

39:22.937 --> 39:24.103
and to support me.

39:37.137 --> 39:38.137
You?

39:40.737 --> 39:41.737
Sultan?

39:47.737 --> 39:48.737
Okay.

39:52.970 --> 39:55.270
Okay, Sadettin Kobek. Okay.

40:01.070 --> 40:02.803
I gained big power with your help.

40:04.037 --> 40:05.837
I will never forget this favor of yours.

40:08.603 --> 40:13.170
I will struggle severely for you
to be the sultan in these lands.

40:26.203 --> 40:27.270
Then, take Noyan

40:28.903 --> 40:30.570
and give me my imprisoned commanders back.

41:22.603 --> 41:25.603
Now Ertugrul, the son of Suleyman Shah.

41:25.903 --> 41:29.937
It is time to renew your oath you made
on the way of this holly battle.

41:49.670 --> 41:51.137
This is your sword.

41:56.070 --> 42:01.303
Hone your sword after weighing it on the
scale of justice with breath of wisdom.

42:03.270 --> 42:08.137
May your sword give hope to the oppressed,
and spread fear to the persecutors.

42:22.670 --> 42:24.670
This is your flag.

42:29.870 --> 42:33.970
I hope 72 nations will find peace
under the shadow of your flag.

42:35.070 --> 42:37.903
And it flaps in the sky until doomsday.

42:51.103 --> 42:52.903
Bismillah.

42:58.270 --> 42:59.703
Bismillah.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.537
This is the Holy Quran.

43:04.003 --> 43:09.570
It explains the truth, lightens the dark
and secures the justice.

43:11.637 --> 43:13.670
May it always be your guide.

43:19.803 --> 43:22.103
Now, have your say.

43:37.970 --> 43:43.003
I swear to God
who fills our hearts with belief

43:44.237 --> 43:47.537
to sword and the Holy Book

43:48.737 --> 43:53.670
that the Sun will be my flag and the sky
will be my tent as I fight to death.

43:55.337 --> 43:59.170
I will secure the justice
and spread fear to the persecutors.

44:01.203 --> 44:03.137
If I deviate
from the cause of this holy battle

44:04.137 --> 44:07.537
or beg for mercy from the enemy

44:08.703 --> 44:11.703
may my sword be covered with my own blood.

44:16.137 --> 44:18.603
May God be with you

44:19.237 --> 44:22.537
on the way of this holy battle
Ertugrul, the son of Suleyman Shah.

44:24.003 --> 44:28.003
May battle be yours,
and the victory be God's.

45:01.570 --> 45:03.103
They must be the ones
who came to take Noyan.

45:11.870 --> 45:13.137
And these three brave men

45:14.603 --> 45:18.670
must be the Seljuk commanders
Ameer Sadettin Kobek told us about.

45:24.203 --> 45:27.737
But, why do they wait here?

45:28.970 --> 45:31.103
Since both sides act cautiously...

45:32.570 --> 45:34.903
Obviously there are wheels within wheels.

45:36.837 --> 45:37.937
What shall we do, Bey?

45:45.670 --> 45:49.070
Boru, prepare the prisoners.
We are going to bring Noyan back.

45:53.703 --> 45:56.270
-Opportunity will come to us, Wild Demir.
-If God permits, Bey.

45:57.037 --> 45:58.070
If God permits.

46:52.970 --> 46:54.603
<i>How could you let him go?</i>

46:55.003 --> 46:58.770
<i>How can he chase</i>
 <i>the Mongolian army and kill Noyan?</i>

46:59.737 --> 47:01.537
<i>He did everything to go.</i>

47:03.237 --> 47:04.703
God, what did I do?

47:09.537 --> 47:10.703
May I come in, Bey?

47:11.703 --> 47:13.803
Yes, Goncagul Hatun. Come in.

47:23.670 --> 47:26.237
I know that Noyan's leaving
made you upset.

47:27.237 --> 47:29.103
I wanted to come and ask
how you are doing.

47:31.903 --> 47:35.070
I thought you would be happy.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.270
Thank you. Your presence is enough for me.

47:43.270 --> 47:44.270
What is that?

47:47.103 --> 47:50.303
This arrow is the one my father threw

47:50.970 --> 47:52.770
into the sky to start the preparations
for the bridal chamber tent.

47:54.570 --> 47:57.803
That night,at the location
which this arrow fell

47:59.037 --> 48:01.303
–I got to my mother's womb.
-Really?

48:03.903 --> 48:07.603
I brought it to you
so that it brings us luck.

48:08.903 --> 48:09.903
Hopefully.

48:11.537 --> 48:12.970
So, we should find a place for it.

48:36.637 --> 48:37.670
What is the matter, Selcan?

48:40.037 --> 48:41.603
I was going to say that
the meal is ready, Bey.

48:43.670 --> 48:45.703
I am not hungry. Thank you.

48:49.203 --> 48:50.203
Selcan.

48:53.337 --> 48:54.337
Come here.

49:04.637 --> 49:07.237
Sit down. I have matters to talk
with both of you.

49:35.803 --> 49:38.770
Do not consider that peace will come
to our nomad group

49:38.937 --> 49:41.303
just because the two states
made peace.

49:43.670 --> 49:45.037
Problems get more and more.

49:46.603 --> 49:49.703
From now on, I do not want any trouble

49:50.603 --> 49:53.870
neither in Mother Hayme's marquee
nor in my tent tor my women's tents.

49:55.103 --> 49:56.303
Do not create more troubles.

49:59.803 --> 50:00.803
Do we have a deal?

50:02.136 --> 50:03.170
Yes, Bey.

50:05.337 --> 50:06.636
Do not worry, Bey.

50:08.537 --> 50:14.637
I hope Selcan Hatun becomes a sister
to me as she is to Gokce Hatun.

50:15.270 --> 50:16.303
She will, she will.

50:17.037 --> 50:18.170
You will, right, Selcan?

50:23.637 --> 50:25.070
I will do my best, Bey.

50:27.670 --> 50:29.270
As long as we have hearts of gold.

50:40.937 --> 50:41.937
With your permission, Bey.

50:44.637 --> 50:45.637
The permission is yours.

52:27.103 --> 52:30.037
If you do not leave the Seljukian lands
in three days

52:31.070 --> 52:34.070
you will be deemed as peace breakers
and be murdered.

52:39.137 --> 52:41.970
When I come back I will destroy
the Seljukian lands completely.

53:20.270 --> 53:25.337
I want you to behave as an old sister
with your pure heart. You know that.

53:27.703 --> 53:29.670
Do not doubt that, Goncagul Hatun.

53:30.603 --> 53:32.170
It is not a trouble to behave
as an old sister.

53:32.837 --> 53:35.103
As long as I find a heart
inside your chest.

53:38.037 --> 53:39.037
Goncagul Hatun.

53:40.603 --> 53:41.803
My mother wants to see you.

53:45.670 --> 53:46.737
I hope nothing is wrong.

53:47.037 --> 53:48.970
I do not know, Goncagul Hatun.
You will find out when you go.

53:50.903 --> 53:53.103
Maybe she wants to finish
her unfinished business.

53:55.337 --> 53:59.337
The consignation stolen from the marquee.
Maybe she wants to listen you.

53:59.970 --> 54:00.970
Who knows?

54:13.737 --> 54:14.737
Did I say right?

54:18.703 --> 54:19.870
We will see what she will tell.

54:21.103 --> 54:22.103
We will see.

54:24.737 --> 54:25.770
Where are you going, Selcan?

54:27.803 --> 54:32.170
We will see if Banu Cicek
will continue to be stubborn.

54:52.303 --> 54:54.203
They said you called me, Mother Hayme.
Here I am.

55:00.103 --> 55:03.703
When Sungurtekin was here at the dinner

55:05.837 --> 55:07.603
why did you step in
where my son stays?

55:09.803 --> 55:11.770
Why do you ask me this, Mother Hayme?

55:12.803 --> 55:15.637
I asked you a question.
I am waiting for your answer.

55:16.837 --> 55:19.537
The person who knows it best
is Gokce Hatun. Ask her if you want.

55:19.703 --> 55:22.237
I am asking you, not her.
Why did you step inside?

55:26.770 --> 55:28.170
I understand you very well, Mother Hayme.

55:29.803 --> 55:32.870
The hand of a betrayer is
on the honorable marquee of Kayi.

55:33.570 --> 55:36.003
It is your duty to find this hand
and cut it.

55:44.970 --> 55:49.537
It is not your place to remind my duties.

55:51.870 --> 55:54.737
I asked you a question and
you give me your answer.

55:57.203 --> 56:01.603
You are very angry because you had
such a weakness in your marquee.

56:02.770 --> 56:06.637
But you know that I entered into there
because Gokce Hatun wanted it.

56:07.303 --> 56:08.603
It was not my own will.

56:12.537 --> 56:14.570
Gokce went out to take fabrics.

56:16.303 --> 56:18.037
You were alone inside. What did you do?

56:21.703 --> 56:22.737
When I was alone

56:23.803 --> 56:26.537
I dreamed of the biggest dream
of a young girl, mother.

56:28.237 --> 56:31.903
I looked at the fabrics that Gokce Hatun
showed and dreamed about the dress

56:32.103 --> 56:34.570
that I will wear before
I marry my man.

56:36.537 --> 56:40.070
The dress that I will wear in the night
that I will give myself to your son.

56:43.137 --> 56:48.103
I think the person who kidnapped Selcan
Hatun from this nomad tent

56:49.737 --> 56:51.537
can take what he wants from your marquee.

56:59.303 --> 57:00.303
Sooner or later

57:01.337 --> 57:04.137
The person who stole that seal
from my marquee will be revealed.

57:06.970 --> 57:08.870
Just as they found Selcan
and brought her back.

57:13.803 --> 57:17.337
Then I will hang that betrayer
in the middle of the nomad tent.

57:19.670 --> 57:22.070
And believe me, no one
will be able to save him.

57:31.670 --> 57:33.037
The spring is coming, Banu Cicek.

57:34.537 --> 57:36.570
This winter was fruitful. Praise be.

57:37.837 --> 57:40.570
Flowers will bloom in mountains.

57:41.937 --> 57:43.570
Do not worry, Hanim.

57:45.137 --> 57:46.570
Have a nice day, Hatuns.

57:50.270 --> 57:51.337
I hope nothing is wrong.

57:53.037 --> 57:54.037
I am going for a visit.

57:55.837 --> 57:56.837
To whom are you going?

57:57.970 --> 58:02.103
An old woman was killed a while ago.
Do you remember, Aytolun?

58:02.970 --> 58:04.270
I am going to her grave.

58:09.170 --> 58:12.570
Who knows who killed that poor woman.

58:13.537 --> 58:16.103
Praise be! How loyal you are.

58:18.537 --> 58:23.170
May someone be loyal in the nomad group
in which murderers run wild.

58:23.603 --> 58:24.603
Right, Aytolun?

58:25.937 --> 58:26.970
May it be easy.

58:32.570 --> 58:34.337
What is she talking about, Hanim?

58:37.803 --> 58:41.170
She is just mad.
She is trying to push it to the limit.

58:43.070 --> 58:44.570
Never mind. Never mind.

59:33.770 --> 59:38.303
Peace came here and now our war begins.

59:50.870 --> 59:52.803
Where did these golds come from, brother?

59:53.937 --> 59:56.037
Those are the sharpest swords

59:56.237 --> 59:59.703
that I will use to abolish the obstacles
in front of my margrave one by one.

01:00:05.837 --> 01:00:07.837
They are from Ameer Sadettin Kobek.

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:17.637
You do not need to use these golds as long
as there are stupid people as Sungur.

01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:21.203
What about him?

01:00:21.903 --> 01:00:25.203
Wild Demir and Sungurtekin disappeared.

01:00:26.003 --> 01:00:28.703
Everybody in Hayme's marquee
is too sorry to say a word.

01:00:29.703 --> 01:00:31.837
It is obvious that peace bothered them.

01:00:33.537 --> 01:00:36.637
It is not good that both
of them disappeared.

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:41.337
It is obvious that they went after Noyan.

01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:53.303
What is it? I hope nothing
is wrong, daughter.

01:00:55.137 --> 01:00:56.137
Mother Hayme...

01:00:58.203 --> 01:00:59.970
...called me to her marquee
and queried me.

01:01:05.803 --> 01:01:06.837
Do not worry.

01:01:08.203 --> 01:01:09.737
I gave the necessary answer.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.137
She is still chasing
the case of the lost seal.

01:01:18.237 --> 01:01:23.203
If she queries even Goncagul then it is
obvious that Selcan is in this.

01:01:24.737 --> 01:01:26.103
Do not forget Halime, aunt.

01:01:32.637 --> 01:01:36.970
She overstepped the limits so much
that she even queried her own bride.

01:01:37.603 --> 01:01:39.270
Our job will not be easy at all, brother.

01:01:43.937 --> 01:01:45.103
Obviously,

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:49.137
we will not be comfortable
in this nomad tent

01:01:49.537 --> 01:01:51.137
unless we bring the Kayis' marquee
down on them.

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:55.270
Daughter.

01:01:55.937 --> 01:02:00.270
You know that Gundogdu is more valuable
than these golds for my margrave.

01:02:02.837 --> 01:02:05.637
I hope he will not get under
my feet like others.

01:02:10.537 --> 01:02:11.537
What if he does?

01:02:16.937 --> 01:02:21.570
If he does, he will get in the grave
with his mother and brothers.

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:38.770
Bey.

01:02:40.137 --> 01:02:41.670
The bastard is coming.

01:03:11.003 --> 01:03:13.070
-Bey.
-Our target is Noyan.

01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:15.670
Our duty is to watch for an opportunity.

01:03:17.703 --> 01:03:20.303
If it is necessary, we will trace him
to hell, Wild Demir.

01:03:33.103 --> 01:03:35.570
My brave children did not miss
their father, Tangut.

01:03:38.137 --> 01:03:39.570
All of them are very sad, Noyan.

01:03:41.537 --> 01:03:46.137
Seeing you like a beaten dog
is very hard for them.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:18.903
My sons are blood-thirsty
for their father.

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:26.970
What else can a father who brought death
but not the victory to his sons expect?

01:04:47.737 --> 01:04:49.970
Ogeday will make you pay for this, Tangut.

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:53.870
Feel sorry for yourself, Noyan.

01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:57.203
The day you will die

01:04:58.303 --> 01:05:00.203
will be the feast of all servants.

01:05:56.603 --> 01:05:58.570
These weasels will fight
each other, Bey.

01:06:02.237 --> 01:06:04.637
Today, only Tangut's blood
will be spilled here.

01:06:06.103 --> 01:06:09.703
Incautious people who believe his words!
Put your swords down.

01:06:10.803 --> 01:06:12.037
Run like hell.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:14.737
None of you will be harmed.

01:06:15.903 --> 01:06:16.970
You have my word.

01:06:23.337 --> 01:06:25.703
We should go, Noyan. Our horses are ready.

01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:28.070
Kill them all!

01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:37.803
Do not let them escape!

01:06:59.937 --> 01:07:00.937
Coward!

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:04.203
It is time. Follow me.

01:07:28.137 --> 01:07:30.137
I will come back to make
your bloodline extinct, Sungurtekin!

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:32.770
Tell Ertugrul to wait for me!

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:34.870
I will strike as thunderbolt
on your nomad tent!

01:07:48.203 --> 01:07:49.203
Noyan!

01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:53.970
For God!

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:09.970
For God!

01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:28.170
Wild Demir!

01:11:27.103 --> 01:11:28.137
Wild Demir!

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.170
Wild Demir!

01:11:38.137 --> 01:11:39.137
Bey.

01:11:40.937 --> 01:11:46.670
Take my daughter's revenge.

01:11:48.903 --> 01:11:51.803
Tell Ertugrul Bey, too.

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:58.137
I shahada that the God is the only One

01:12:00.237 --> 01:12:07.003
and Prophet Mohammad is his servant
and his messenger.

01:12:31.303 --> 01:12:32.303
Wild Demir!

01:13:33.103 --> 01:13:35.103
What is the matter, Bey? Why did we stop?

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:40.037
You continue. You continue.

01:13:44.203 --> 01:13:45.203
Thank you, Bey.

01:13:59.903 --> 01:14:00.937
Peace be upon you, Bey.

01:14:46.303 --> 01:14:47.603
I hope nothing is wrong, mother?

01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:50.270
Why do you have a face like a wet weekend?

01:14:52.703 --> 01:14:53.970
We should go inside, son.

01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:18.321
Be seated.

01:15:32.324 --> 01:15:33.324
What is wrong, mother?

01:15:36.857 --> 01:15:40.191
Trader Efrasiyap turns out to be
Noyan's man.

01:15:42.724 --> 01:15:43.791
What are you saying, brother?

01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:46.657
He kidnapped
Selcan from the nomad tent.

01:15:46.757 --> 01:15:50.757
Do not worry. Selcan is fine.
I managed to bring her back.

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:57.024
Hamza Alp was martyred.

01:16:03.357 --> 01:16:05.957
I also managed to bring Noyan to
the nomad tent.

01:16:09.824 --> 01:16:13.691
Thank God, we see these days.
What about Noyan?

01:16:21.591 --> 01:16:25.824
He was just about to be executed,
Emir Saadettin Kobek came.

01:16:27.591 --> 01:16:32.991
There was a peaceful agreement with
our government and the Mongols.

01:16:33.324 --> 01:16:35.257
What does it have to do with
Noyan bastard?

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:39.091
We handed Noyan over
to Mongols in exchange of

01:16:40.991 --> 01:16:43.691
three prisoners of Seljukian commander.

01:16:43.957 --> 01:16:45.024
What are you saying, mother?

01:16:48.857 --> 01:16:50.224
How could you let something like
this happen, brother?

01:16:50.624 --> 01:16:53.757
We did not want to damage our
government's peace agreement.

01:16:55.157 --> 01:16:57.091
Just think about what
this bastard murderer who

01:16:57.191 --> 01:16:59.057
even kidnapped Selcan Hatun

01:16:59.191 --> 01:17:02.724
to achieve his goals would do to the
women of our tent if he gets the chance.

01:17:03.057 --> 01:17:05.157
How could you leave him knowing that

01:17:05.257 --> 01:17:07.257
he would take revenge on us
and our loved ones?

01:17:10.391 --> 01:17:13.724
What did Sungur Tekin tell about this?
How did he let you free him?

01:17:15.824 --> 01:17:18.291
He persuaded us and
the men of two nomad groups

01:17:18.391 --> 01:17:22.224
to follow the peace agreement.

01:17:24.624 --> 01:17:25.957
Tell me, brother,

01:17:28.091 --> 01:17:29.191
what would you do
if it were you?

01:17:30.591 --> 01:17:33.657
Did we not come to these mountains
to die for our government?

01:17:33.791 --> 01:17:36.757
Now, are we supposed to break our
royal decree?

01:17:37.391 --> 01:17:40.057
Blood flows, peace finds its way, brother.

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:45.191
The peace that comes from that sick
bastard does not avail

01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:48.291
to neither our tent nor our state.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:51.824
You could not take precautions.

01:17:52.157 --> 01:17:54.324
Mother, I'm telling you as well.

01:17:55.057 --> 01:17:58.257
We paid for the mistakes you
made before with our many lives.

01:17:59.391 --> 01:18:01.924
We will see what is going to be
the price of this mistake of yours.

01:18:05.124 --> 01:18:06.124
Where is Sungur Tekin?

01:18:11.957 --> 01:18:13.324
He went to chase after Noyan.

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:16.657
Wild Demir must be with him.

01:18:27.991 --> 01:18:31.324
-What happened to you Wild Demir bey?
-Wild Demir Bey.

01:18:32.391 --> 01:18:34.391
What happened to you Wild Demir Bey?

01:18:34.657 --> 01:18:35.924
Oh, my Wild Demir Bey.

01:19:51.824 --> 01:19:52.824
Who did this?

01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:55.591
Tangut.

01:20:02.224 --> 01:20:05.591
I killed Tangut. However, Noyan
managed to escape.

01:20:14.924 --> 01:20:16.124
Yes!

01:21:12.591 --> 01:21:13.591
Father!

01:21:31.824 --> 01:21:32.957
Father!

01:21:41.957 --> 01:21:42.957
Father!

01:21:47.124 --> 01:21:48.124
Father!

01:21:54.191 --> 01:21:55.191
Wild Demir?

01:21:57.291 --> 01:21:58.291
Wild Demir?

01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:00.791
Wild Demir?

01:22:36.157 --> 01:22:37.157
Father!

01:22:56.357 --> 01:22:57.624
There are wheels within wheels,
Ulubilge.

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:02.024
Otherwise, Tangut, who is shaken
like a cow in front of me,

01:23:04.057 --> 01:23:05.391
could not dare to counter me.

01:23:07.757 --> 01:23:10.157
If Saadettin Kopek
had not thrown a bone to him,

01:23:10.257 --> 01:23:12.791
he would not have dared to do this.

01:23:57.024 --> 01:24:00.324
Send his body to Saadettin Kobek.
He should see his own death.

01:24:03.991 --> 01:24:06.191
We should set off to go to Ogeday
right away, Ulubilge.

01:24:07.391 --> 01:24:10.724
You are badly hurt, Noyan.
You should rest.

01:24:11.057 --> 01:24:12.391
We do not have time to waste.

01:24:13.291 --> 01:24:16.191
I should prepare a bigger and stronger
army for war.

01:24:27.257 --> 01:24:32.691
Our state made peace. Saadettin Kobek,
who is the most precious Emir

01:24:32.791 --> 01:24:36.357
of our Sultan came to our nomad tent,
only to solve this matter.

01:24:36.824 --> 01:24:40.257
They do not care about any of these.

01:24:42.191 --> 01:24:46.924
They are so disorderly as to chase
Noyan just to kill him.

01:24:47.857 --> 01:24:49.624
They have killed Tangut.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.024
Noyan has succeeded to escape.

01:25:00.391 --> 01:25:03.691
As long as Sungur Tekin
and Ertugrul lives,

01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:07.591
they will continue to get
in our ways and be trouble for us.

01:25:09.057 --> 01:25:12.257
The hammer smith who died.
Is his funeral tomorrow?

01:25:13.757 --> 01:25:14.757
Yes.

01:25:24.824 --> 01:25:27.191
I will attend his funeral before
going to Konya tomorrow.

01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:30.591
You will do the necessary.

01:25:31.057 --> 01:25:33.924
Now that they are
very close to the deceased,

01:25:34.924 --> 01:25:37.191
I want to share the
pain of my brave brothers.

01:25:39.591 --> 01:25:41.857
Did I mishear you, Emir Saadettin?

01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:46.924
I say they have to die, yet you are
here talking about sharing their pains?

01:25:49.724 --> 01:25:52.357
Which one is more powerful,
Gumustekin?

01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:55.824
This or your weapon?

01:25:58.924 --> 01:26:02.357
What your weapon cuts
will eventually be soil.

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:07.591
But, what this cuts will be eternal.

01:26:11.357 --> 01:26:14.857
If you want to be the margrave of
Seljukian, you should know this better.

01:26:16.657 --> 01:26:21.724
Whoever tries to take care of his
business only with his weapon

01:26:22.591 --> 01:26:24.591
his life lasts only as long as
his weapon cuts.

01:26:27.157 --> 01:26:28.224
The real dexterity

01:26:34.724 --> 01:26:39.291
is to know being permanent
like this Seljukian engraving.

01:26:42.924 --> 01:26:48.324
It is to bring his people light
with bloodless victories.

01:26:52.024 --> 01:26:54.091
As for Sungur Tekin and Ertugrul.

01:26:54.824 --> 01:26:57.824
I prefer them fighting for me

01:26:58.057 --> 01:27:01.057
to their stinky dead bodies.

01:27:02.057 --> 01:27:03.924
How will this happen?

01:27:04.857 --> 01:27:07.691
You will know when the time comes.

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:09.291
Now, you go.

01:27:32.791 --> 01:27:34.924
-Emir Highness.
-Yes?

01:27:35.324 --> 01:27:38.057
A stray horse brought
a wicker basket to the yard.

01:27:38.157 --> 01:27:39.291
I thought you may want to see.

01:28:18.957 --> 01:28:20.057
You bastard Noyan!

01:28:32.091 --> 01:28:35.324
Noyan. You fortunate rascal.

01:28:39.324 --> 01:28:41.991
So, you got the seal of Oghuz Khan,
Sungur Tekin.

01:28:52.157 --> 01:28:56.257
Good. The seal of the state
is in good hands.

01:28:57.257 --> 01:28:59.291
Take his body to the woods.

01:29:01.124 --> 01:29:04.691
His death shall be the feast of ravens.

01:29:42.791 --> 01:29:45.391
<i>What makes the land</i>
 <i>a homeland is a grave.</i>

01:30:16.091 --> 01:30:18.257
You gave your life to make
this land home.

01:30:21.991 --> 01:30:27.957
Your wife, two sons and your daughter
became martyrs in the battlefield.

01:30:33.791 --> 01:30:37.857
Now, you have been martyred and
reunited with them.

01:30:52.357 --> 01:30:53.891
You should know that

01:30:55.224 --> 01:31:00.791
I will not stop until my last breath
to make here the homeland.

01:31:21.224 --> 01:31:25.724
I swear in front of your dead body that
I will establish the home

01:31:25.824 --> 01:31:28.091
you longed for in Byzantine lands.

01:31:33.791 --> 01:31:38.624
You should know that I am with you until
death in this blessed case, Bey.

01:31:41.024 --> 01:31:44.924
I have waited for a brave man like you
for this blessed case all my life.

01:31:47.124 --> 01:31:49.291
May God help us!

01:32:16.757 --> 01:32:22.091
<i>It shall be the voice of injustice in</i>
 <i>your brave hands. It shall be the wrath.</i>

01:32:25.657 --> 01:32:26.757
Wonderful.

01:32:30.391 --> 01:32:32.257
Thank God, for giving you to us.

01:32:49.724 --> 01:32:51.224
Ertugrul is right again.

01:32:54.124 --> 01:32:59.591
Wild Demir firstly paid
the price of conceding Noyan.

01:33:01.991 --> 01:33:06.324
-I hope it will be the last one, mother.
-If God permits, daughter.

01:33:07.257 --> 01:33:08.391
If God permits.

01:33:38.857 --> 01:33:40.824
Peace be upon you, my brothers.

01:33:56.724 --> 01:33:58.124
My condolences to us, brothers.

01:34:01.357 --> 01:34:02.857
My condolences to us, Bey.

01:34:05.591 --> 01:34:07.157
Whoever we love

01:34:09.091 --> 01:34:12.924
is departing this life one by one,
Bey.

01:34:13.691 --> 01:34:16.357
Then, it is our duty to die
for the rest, Turgut.

01:34:29.191 --> 01:34:31.891
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:34:43.057 --> 01:34:47.057
Ertugrul Bey, Wild Demir is gone.
He was going to make my first weapon.

01:34:47.157 --> 01:34:48.391
He was going to make me an Alp.

01:35:02.824 --> 01:35:03.957
Do not worry,

01:35:05.191 --> 01:35:07.591
brave men like you will never be alone
in these mountains.

01:35:11.757 --> 01:35:16.157
After this, Turali is entrusted first to
you, then to me, Bey.

01:35:17.391 --> 01:35:18.724
Of course, Artuk Bey,

01:35:21.857 --> 01:35:22.857
of course.

01:35:46.357 --> 01:35:49.291
Allahuakhbar!

01:36:23.691 --> 01:36:25.657
<i>Brave sons of Oghuz!</i>

01:36:26.057 --> 01:36:30.391
<i>I'm Wild Demir from Kayi tribe.</i>

01:36:31.524 --> 01:36:33.124
<i>For so long,</i>

01:36:33.224 --> 01:36:37.157
<i>I flared up the flames,</i>
 <i>I melted the iron.</i>

01:36:39.091 --> 01:36:40.891
<i>I made weapons from steel.</i>

01:36:42.957 --> 01:36:47.557
I became ancestor to son,
son to ancestor.

01:36:54.324 --> 01:36:55.324
Allahuakhbar.

01:37:01.524 --> 01:37:06.091
<i>Mortal life. Life ends with death.</i>

01:37:08.357 --> 01:37:12.991
<i>Now, I'm joining the caravan</i>
 <i>of the departing.</i>

01:37:14.591 --> 01:37:18.691
<i>However, I am leaving without worry.</i>

01:37:21.157 --> 01:37:26.557
<i>Ertugrul Bey, relieve yourself.</i>

01:37:29.291 --> 01:37:31.557
<i>When the time comes,</i>
 <i>the roses bloom,</i>

01:37:33.024 --> 01:37:37.891
<i>the sun rises, and winter meets spring.</i>

01:37:41.591 --> 01:37:45.157
God who gave you
the urge to conquest

01:37:46.057 --> 01:37:48.291
<i>will make you a conqueror.</i>

01:37:50.324 --> 01:37:56.491
<i>With thousands of mounted raiders,</i>
 <i>you will run from continent to continent.</i>

01:37:58.891 --> 01:38:05.124
<i>The sparkles that splash off of your</i>
 <i>horseshoes will make the cruel fear.</i>

01:38:08.291 --> 01:38:11.257
<i>Your conquests</i>
 <i>will meddle with the winds.</i>

01:38:13.957 --> 01:38:18.691
<i>The flag of our ancestors' inheritance</i>
 <i>will cover the horizon.</i>

01:38:21.291 --> 01:38:24.491
<i>I know that there will</i>
 <i>be a poor Wild Demir.</i>

01:38:25.957 --> 01:38:30.324
<i>He will tell</i>
 <i>your sagas to children.</i>

01:38:35.424 --> 01:38:38.191
<i>Spreading from mouth</i>
 <i>to mouth your sagas</i>

01:38:40.191 --> 01:38:45.924
<i>will give strength to the</i>
 <i>poor and fear to the cruel.</i>

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:55.891
Under the flag, nobody will hurt anybody.

01:38:58.691 --> 01:39:02.691
This road is tough, this road is full
of suffering.

01:39:04.157 --> 01:39:05.891
Your burden is heavy.

01:39:07.391 --> 01:39:09.557
May God help you and
be with you, Ertugrul Bey.

01:42:35.357 --> 01:42:36.357
Emir Saadettin.

01:42:41.324 --> 01:42:43.324
Ertugrul brother and I
want to talk to you.

01:42:46.224 --> 01:42:48.524
First of all, my condolences.

01:42:48.624 --> 01:42:52.191
I heard you are close
friends with the hammersmith.

01:42:52.291 --> 01:42:57.457
I wanted to attend the funeral
of this honorable brave man.

01:42:57.557 --> 01:42:58.657
My condolences.

01:43:02.991 --> 01:43:08.057
So, you are Ertugrul Bey. The source of
pride for our Sultan.

01:43:11.124 --> 01:43:13.657
What happened is bothering us,
Emir Saadettin.

01:43:15.557 --> 01:43:16.991
Tell me, tell me.

01:43:17.457 --> 01:43:19.424
If there were not traitors in the palace,

01:43:19.524 --> 01:43:21.491
Sungur Tekin would
not have been exposed

01:43:22.124 --> 01:43:23.991
and he would have kept
to his duty for his state.

01:43:26.324 --> 01:43:30.357
If you had not galloped
for the bastard Noyan,

01:43:30.457 --> 01:43:35.191
he would have been executed
and wasted away.

01:43:36.024 --> 01:43:40.991
Be at ease. We have cleaned all the
traitors at the palace one by one.

01:43:42.691 --> 01:43:44.524
Obviously,
you have not cleaned enough.

01:43:47.257 --> 01:43:50.491
The traitors in the palace can reach
through my nomad tent, Emir Saadettin.

01:43:53.157 --> 01:43:54.424
Which cleaning are you talking about?

01:43:56.257 --> 01:44:02.491
You should know that I will find and
cut the hand that holds the strings.

01:44:04.224 --> 01:44:07.024
Wherever it comes from in the palace.

01:44:10.024 --> 01:44:14.324
If you had obeyed
the commands of the state,

01:44:15.457 --> 01:44:19.324
this poor hammersmith
would be alive today, Ertugrul Bey.

01:44:21.557 --> 01:44:25.024
How can you say that in
the face of all the things

01:44:25.124 --> 01:44:28.124
we have done for our
government for years?

01:44:28.324 --> 01:44:31.457
Obeying the state does not mean to
obey when you wish,

01:44:31.557 --> 01:44:33.257
rebel when you do not.

01:44:35.491 --> 01:44:39.124
You should obey even if you are hurt.

01:44:39.224 --> 01:44:43.657
So that the government
will rely on you.

01:44:46.124 --> 01:44:47.924
Now, listen to me carefully.

01:44:48.224 --> 01:44:51.657
I was holding Tangut's strings
from the beginning.

01:44:54.457 --> 01:44:59.324
It was going fine until Ertugrul got
involved in the Karabek issue

01:44:59.424 --> 01:45:02.957
and blew everything.

01:45:03.057 --> 01:45:09.157
Then, Sungur Tekin came. I pulled
his leash tight and he cut my horse.

01:45:09.491 --> 01:45:10.957
What are you saying, Emir Saadettin?

01:45:11.257 --> 01:45:15.591
If you had not shown up with that old
hammersmith showing heroism

01:45:16.024 --> 01:45:22.357
Tangut was going to kill Noyan and
take your responsibility of years.

01:45:23.891 --> 01:45:27.991
I would make Tangut commander
instead of Noyan.

01:45:28.957 --> 01:45:30.691
I would make him drown in gold.

01:45:32.191 --> 01:45:36.524
However, you and the old hammersmith
messed it up.

01:45:40.891 --> 01:45:44.524
This state was not established
while herding goats like you do, Beys.

01:45:49.224 --> 01:45:53.324
Of course, there was always support
from brave men like you.

01:45:54.924 --> 01:45:58.691
However, government is way above
your apprehension.

01:46:00.991 --> 01:46:04.324
No wonder that we have been
standing tall and strong

01:46:04.424 --> 01:46:07.324
for hundreds of years in these lands and

01:46:07.457 --> 01:46:10.124
thousands of years in the world.

01:46:11.124 --> 01:46:13.891
I told
everything to Sultan Alaaddin.

01:46:15.891 --> 01:46:19.591
He is to write a letter and confirm
my words to you soon.

01:46:21.357 --> 01:46:25.091
I wish two brave men like you

01:46:26.124 --> 01:46:30.691
will learn to obey
the state and its commands.

01:46:32.091 --> 01:46:35.991
I have my eyes and
ears on you after this.

01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:39.557
I hope

01:46:40.424 --> 01:46:43.691
you will not disappoint me again.

01:46:50.224 --> 01:46:55.057
We will take the revenge of Wild Demir.
Noyan will die eventually.

01:46:57.157 --> 01:46:59.024
I will do whatever is necessary
for him to die.

01:47:02.091 --> 01:47:04.091
Be sure that it will be
vouchsafed to you.

01:47:08.657 --> 01:47:10.057
Because it is your right.

01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:12.091
May God protect you.

01:47:29.991 --> 01:47:33.057
-What do you say, brother?
-I do not know, Ertugrul

01:47:34.124 --> 01:47:37.357
who will we trust, if we do not
trust the man that comes after Sultan.

01:47:39.224 --> 01:47:44.691
-What do you think?
-I will wait for the Sultan's letter.

01:47:47.224 --> 01:47:48.224
I am not feeling at ease.

01:47:55.457 --> 01:47:57.657
The seal must be in safe hands
from now on, Ertugrul.

01:48:00.257 --> 01:48:02.324
I want you to give the seal to
the white beardeds.

01:48:07.191 --> 01:48:08.591
From now on, my duty is over.

01:48:08.691 --> 01:48:12.957
I will go
wherever my nomad group goes.

01:48:28.157 --> 01:48:29.891
Peace be upon you.

01:48:40.749 --> 01:48:42.449
In the name of God,

01:48:42.549 --> 01:48:47.982
the compassionate,
the merciful, the forgiving God.

01:48:48.849 --> 01:48:49.849
My Maker!

01:48:51.349 --> 01:48:54.549
We showed ingratitude, we abominated.

01:48:55.582 --> 01:48:57.849
We lost the dignity of being Muslim.

01:48:59.916 --> 01:49:04.516
We could not be grateful enough for your
blessings. Forgive us!

01:49:06.882 --> 01:49:08.316
My Creator!

01:49:09.916 --> 01:49:14.482
You made a cave as a castle,
spider web as an armour,

01:49:15.316 --> 01:49:19.816
a piegon as spear for
Muslims against the cruel.

01:49:21.282 --> 01:49:25.649
God! Get us from the
borehole that we're in today.

01:49:25.749 --> 01:49:30.849
Give us help and mercy so that
we can reach our dignity again,

01:49:30.949 --> 01:49:36.582
we can be worthy of being Muslim,
being free as human.

01:49:37.682 --> 01:49:41.882
You help our brave men so
that we do not bow to the enemies.

01:49:42.982 --> 01:49:47.549
Give us help so that we
will not give our freedom to cruel.

01:49:48.816 --> 01:49:50.816
We shall be victorious always.

01:49:52.682 --> 01:49:56.316
Amen!

01:50:15.882 --> 01:50:18.649
We're mourning for the brave son of
Oghuz,

01:50:18.749 --> 01:50:24.282
the hammersmith Tarkan, Wild Demir.

01:50:25.016 --> 01:50:27.649
There is not a day without mourning
in this nomad tent.

01:50:27.749 --> 01:50:31.682
I know that both tents
have suffered a lot.

01:50:32.516 --> 01:50:35.216
Many of our brave sons got
martyrized.

01:50:36.816 --> 01:50:41.349
I wish Wild Demir will be
the last Hayme Hatun.

01:50:42.549 --> 01:50:45.749
And peace come to our nomad tents.

01:50:46.816 --> 01:50:52.749
There is peace between the two states.
However, Noyan will not know peace.

01:50:53.649 --> 01:50:58.516
He will not stop. He will be back
eventually to be our death.

01:50:59.382 --> 01:51:00.716
You should have thought of it

01:51:00.816 --> 01:51:03.716
before you handed Noyan over
to Emir Saadettin, Sungur Tekin.

01:51:03.816 --> 01:51:09.982
What happened has happened.
From now on, we must think of future.

01:51:10.349 --> 01:51:11.882
If we had been afraid of death,

01:51:11.982 --> 01:51:14.582
we would not have fought
for our government

01:51:14.682 --> 01:51:18.682
in the mountains of Erzurum
against the Mongols.

01:51:19.782 --> 01:51:22.349
Now, peace is hope for us.

01:51:23.482 --> 01:51:27.616
We all must continue our lives.

01:51:27.982 --> 01:51:31.649
I say, if you approve, I would like to

01:51:33.482 --> 01:51:35.916
solemnize the marriage of my son and
Gokce.

01:51:41.782 --> 01:51:43.949
You are right, Korkut Bey.

01:51:45.949 --> 01:51:50.349
His martyrization set
our hearts on fire.

01:51:51.316 --> 01:51:52.549
Our pain is great.

01:51:53.616 --> 01:51:59.782
But, as you said, life goes on.

01:52:01.749 --> 01:52:04.716
We shall solemnize
the marriage of our children soon.

01:52:12.549 --> 01:52:14.849
-May it be easy, Hatuns.
-Thank you.

01:52:16.816 --> 01:52:17.849
May it be easy.

01:52:23.982 --> 01:52:25.982
You are heavily pregnant Halime Sultan,
what are you doing?

01:52:26.982 --> 01:52:28.916
I washed three pieces, Ertugrul Bey.

01:52:30.649 --> 01:52:32.916
Do not see me as Sultan's daughter.
I am the girl of nomad tent.

01:52:37.816 --> 01:52:40.516
He is struggling to become
a more brave

01:52:41.549 --> 01:52:45.849
and stronger man in your belly.

01:52:49.216 --> 01:52:51.316
There is a great uproar inside of me,
Ertugrul.

01:52:51.849 --> 01:52:54.282
He is fluttering to conquer
the world.

01:53:00.249 --> 01:53:01.249
What if it is a girl?

01:53:04.582 --> 01:53:06.316
If it is a girl,

01:53:06.416 --> 01:53:09.582
then, she struggles
to be as beautiful,

01:53:10.282 --> 01:53:15.249
brave, and smart as her mother.

01:53:21.282 --> 01:53:24.482
I can imagine him riding horse in
these mountains with you, Ertugrul.

01:53:26.582 --> 01:53:29.749
From Erzurum to Afat,
Diyarbekir to Aliagi.

01:53:31.249 --> 01:53:34.649
-Maybe from Enguru to Sogut.
-Enguru?

01:53:39.882 --> 01:53:44.416
We will hit the road as soon as it is
spring and trees blossom, Halime Sultan.

01:53:45.416 --> 01:53:46.649
Where to, Ertugrul?

01:53:48.382 --> 01:53:52.782
Our son will ride in Byzantian borders.

01:53:56.449 --> 01:53:58.849
Did you talk to Mother Hayme and
Gundogdu Bey?

01:54:02.449 --> 01:54:03.449
Not yet.

01:54:04.482 --> 01:54:07.316
Ertugrul, we just got out of trouble.

01:54:08.482 --> 01:54:12.482
It means going into a new trouble
just as we have found peace.

01:54:12.849 --> 01:54:14.282
What would they say to this?

01:54:16.549 --> 01:54:17.949
We will see when it's time.

01:54:19.982 --> 01:54:25.249
However, all I know is that we will hit
the road as soon as our baby is born.

01:54:29.349 --> 01:54:31.249
Wherever you go we go Ertugrul.

01:54:32.216 --> 01:54:33.982
You should know that
we are three from now on.

01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:00.980
I shut Korkut's wife Duru's tongue...

01:55:01.946 --> 01:55:06.346
...which is as big as my boot
as poisonous as a snake...

01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:09.580
...with this poison.

01:55:11.946 --> 01:55:13.513
Now in the same marquee...

01:55:14.313 --> 01:55:17.813
...I will decay the heart of that old man
who is her husband...

01:55:19.446 --> 01:55:21.280
...with the same poison.

01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.980
I asked so much from you, Aytolun.

01:55:28.446 --> 01:55:31.746
But the worst was that I asked
you to be Korkut's wife.

01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:38.646
That old man's smell on me
will vanish sooner or later.

01:55:39.746 --> 01:55:44.213
But your margravity...

01:55:45.246 --> 01:55:47.513
...will always be a loadstar to Oghuz.

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:56.213
As Tugtekin and Gokce are playing
with each other in the nuptial...

01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:00.513
...the old man who is his father,
will draw his last breath.

01:56:02.813 --> 01:56:03.980
The wedding night...

01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:09.880
...will be the night for Korkut to die
and you to reborn, brother.

01:56:11.946 --> 01:56:14.480
How I can make up for your help, Aytolun?

01:56:17.646 --> 01:56:18.746
If you will excuse me, brother.

01:56:20.213 --> 01:56:21.780
I have things to do in the marquee.

01:57:40.846 --> 01:57:44.413
<i>If you help me find what that</i>
 <i>whore Aytolun hid in the tent...</i>

01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:46.646
<i>Enough! I will never betray</i>
 <i>my Hanim and Bey!</i>

01:57:46.813 --> 01:57:49.180
<i>What is that you know</i>
 <i>but do not tell, Banu Cicek?</i>

01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:54.380
<i>Solving this issue comes</i>
 <i>before everything.</i>

01:57:54.613 --> 01:57:56.246
<i>It is your duty to your Bey, Korkut?</i>

01:58:04.313 --> 01:58:05.380
<i>Banu Cicek!</i>

01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:13.813
<i>Banu Cicek!</i>

01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:24.913
Banu Cicek?

01:58:27.713 --> 01:58:28.846
Where have you been?

01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:34.713
I am looking for you.

01:58:36.613 --> 01:58:39.480
-What are you doing here?
-I am tidying around, Hanim.

01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:41.980
Is now the right time for tidying around?

01:58:43.246 --> 01:58:44.880
First finish the things, I told you to do.

01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:46.813
Your wish is my command, Hanim.

01:58:51.846 --> 01:58:55.480
Banu Cicek, your head is in the clouds.

01:58:56.246 --> 01:58:59.280
Since Kayis came,
we cannot get rid of troubles.

01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:01.580
Look sharp.

01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:08.246
And never forget your duty
in this marquee.

01:59:32.213 --> 01:59:33.280
Dogan Alp?

01:59:40.413 --> 01:59:41.680
My condolences, I wanted to say.

01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:46.413
Wild Demir was more than a father to you.
I know.

01:59:49.313 --> 01:59:50.346
Thank you.

01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:56.780
Look, Banu Cicek. The things
that happened last time...

01:59:56.980 --> 02:00:00.813
All the things that happened last time
are bygones.

02:00:02.546 --> 02:00:03.846
Let us forget about them.

02:00:05.513 --> 02:00:07.180
Anyway, I was so rough to you.

02:00:08.513 --> 02:00:12.413
I went too far, I held my dagger to the
throat of a brave man like you.

02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:15.946
Thank you.

02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:18.346
Thank you.

02:00:53.513 --> 02:00:54.546
Banu Cicek.

02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:01.213
Tell me now. Why do you doubt Aytolun?

02:01:02.446 --> 02:01:05.613
I can not tell you but you must know...

02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:10.713
...that whore Aytolun spinned the web
on Uncle Korkut's marquee...

02:01:10.913 --> 02:01:12.880
...like a poisonous spider.

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:15.713
Now, she is spinning on
Mother Hayme's marquee.

02:01:19.613 --> 02:01:23.213
Because of you,
I entered Korkut Bey's tent.

02:01:24.246 --> 02:01:26.880
I searched everywhere like a thief.

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:29.346
I was about to be caught.

02:01:30.413 --> 02:01:33.713
Now, you will tell me,
but you will tell me the truth.

02:01:34.946 --> 02:01:38.780
Or I swear to God, I will cut
your throat Selcan Hatun.

02:01:39.846 --> 02:01:42.380
Now tell me. Why do you doubt her?

02:01:43.813 --> 02:01:44.913
Banu Cicek.

02:01:47.246 --> 02:01:48.346
You know that...

02:01:49.713 --> 02:01:54.380
...Aytolun was Uncle Korkut's lover...

02:01:55.646 --> 02:01:57.480
...before Aunt Duru died.

02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:00.413
I learned that from the old woman.

02:02:00.846 --> 02:02:04.180
I would learn more but she killed her.

02:02:05.313 --> 02:02:07.780
But I know, I know Banu Cicek.

02:02:07.946 --> 02:02:09.546
What do you know? What more do you know?

02:02:10.546 --> 02:02:17.180
Aytolun killed my aunt Duru
to be the Hanim of marquee.

02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:47.913
<i>-God is immortal!</i>
 <i>-God is the one!</i>

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:50.346
<i>-God is immortal!</i>
 <i>-God is the one!</i>

02:02:50.813 --> 02:02:52.413
<i>-God is immortal!</i>
 <i>-God is the one!</i>

02:02:53.213 --> 02:02:54.846
<i>-God is immortal!</i>
 <i>-God is the one!</i>

02:02:55.246 --> 02:02:56.713
<i>-God is immortal!</i>
 <i>-God is the one!</i>

02:02:56.946 --> 02:02:58.613
<i>-God is immortal!</i>
 <i>-God is the one!</i>

02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:00.313
<i>-God is immortal!</i>
 <i>-God is the one!</i>

02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:01.646
<i>God is immortal!</i>

02:03:23.613 --> 02:03:24.613
I told him not to come.

02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:28.246
I told him many brave men would expect
many zulfiqars from him.

02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:30.980
Even if two worlds come together...

02:03:32.546 --> 02:03:36.613
...I would never let Wild Demir,
Noyan go freely from this nomad tent.

02:03:38.446 --> 02:03:39.880
We will avenge the blood
they shed, Ertugrul...

02:03:40.213 --> 02:03:41.713
...for both our many brave men
and Wild Demir.

02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:49.980
Without finding the traitor
in the nomad tent...

02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:55.780
...we can never avenge our many brave men
or Noyan's death, brother.

02:03:57.813 --> 02:04:01.213
How was the seal captured by Tangut?
Why did he revolt against Noyan?

02:04:01.813 --> 02:04:04.580
All of the answers are here, Ertugrul.
In this nomad tent.

02:04:07.946 --> 02:04:10.713
Ameer Sadettin already gave
its answer, brother.

02:04:13.713 --> 02:04:14.946
What are you trying to say, brother?

02:04:15.646 --> 02:04:19.846
Whoever tried to use Tangut,
may use anyone in our nomad tent.

02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:26.280
It is high time to talk with Gumustekin.

02:05:03.513 --> 02:05:04.546
Banu Cicek.

02:05:06.346 --> 02:05:07.946
The necklace is very important to me.

02:05:10.213 --> 02:05:14.313
Aytolun killed that poor woman
to silence her.

02:05:16.946 --> 02:05:20.846
Goncagul threatens me...

02:05:21.913 --> 02:05:25.346
...to tell everyone I killed that
old woman using my necklace.

02:05:28.313 --> 02:05:29.980
What else should I tell you
to make you believe me?

02:05:32.813 --> 02:05:36.813
Duru Hatun was a mother
both to me and my sister.

02:05:38.346 --> 02:05:41.513
She brought us up.
She was a second mother to us.

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:44.813
Will you help me?

02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:48.946
To avenge Aunt Duru as well?

02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:52.413
Will you help me?

02:06:05.313 --> 02:06:09.213
The necklace is in Korkut Bey's marquee.

02:06:22.846 --> 02:06:24.213
How are you, Goncagul Hatun?

02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:25.780
I am fine, Bey. You?

02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:27.813
Thank you.

02:06:28.913 --> 02:06:30.213
How is Gokce Hatun?

02:06:30.813 --> 02:06:32.680
She does not know what to do
due to her excitement.

02:06:33.413 --> 02:06:36.713
-It is not easy to be a Bey's wife.
-You are right.

02:06:37.580 --> 02:06:41.213
It is not easy to have a marriage
with a hero like Tugtekin.

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:46.746
You are right, Bey. I feel the same
excitement in my heart.

02:06:58.713 --> 02:07:01.280
Know that we will be married
as soon as possible.

02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:06.813
If God permits. Until the day comes,
my heart will carry this excitement Bey.

02:07:07.713 --> 02:07:08.746
If God permits.

02:07:11.213 --> 02:07:12.313
Alright, I will take my leave then.

02:07:36.813 --> 02:07:38.713
She suddenly got in, Bey.
I could not stop her.

02:07:44.713 --> 02:07:46.213
What do you want Selcan Hatun?

02:07:47.813 --> 02:07:49.946
Whatever you will say, say later,
can you not?

02:07:50.813 --> 02:07:54.580
I know what you were doing with Aytolun,
behind Aunt Duru's back...

02:07:54.813 --> 02:07:56.713
...before she died, Uncle Korkut!

02:08:02.213 --> 02:08:03.213
What are you saying?

02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:06.513
Do not try to act brave with me!

02:08:07.946 --> 02:08:09.580
Just listen to what I know!

02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:14.180
You lost your mind.

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:17.213
Maybe, who knows?

02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:24.480
But first, listen what I will tell you
then decide if I lost my mind or not!

02:08:27.246 --> 02:08:28.313
Be seated.

02:08:29.513 --> 02:08:31.746
What I will say may tire your old heart.

02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:35.313
Be seated.

02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:49.813
Do not worry!

02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:54.946
What I will tell you will stay between us.
No one will know.

02:08:55.913 --> 02:09:00.346
However, only you will know what to do
after you listen to me.

02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:08.880
Do you remember the poor old woman
murdered near the nomad tent?

02:09:10.846 --> 02:09:13.546
Aytolun killed that woman, Uncle Korkut.

02:09:14.546 --> 02:09:15.746
Do you know why?

02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:23.680
The woman took the most precious
necklace of my mother from me...

02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:26.913
...to tell me what she knows
about Aytolun.

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:34.680
And then she told me that before
Aunt Duru died, Aytolun was your lover.

02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:39.746
She would tell more but she asked
for more gold.

02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:42.613
To give her what she wanted,
I went back to the tent.

02:09:42.946 --> 02:09:44.646
When I went back, she was already dead.

02:09:45.446 --> 02:09:47.546
Aytolun killed that woman.

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:50.580
Do you know why, Uncle Korkut?

02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:53.513
Do you know, what she would tell me?

02:09:54.980 --> 02:09:56.346
I know, now.

02:09:57.946 --> 02:10:03.680
Aytolun killed Aunt Duru
to be the Hatun of marquee!

02:10:07.313 --> 02:10:08.380
Get out of here!

02:10:09.346 --> 02:10:10.580
I told you to get out of here!

02:10:11.213 --> 02:10:14.246
My necklace is in your marquee.
Aytolun is hiding it.

02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:16.813
To blame me, if I talk.

02:10:18.446 --> 02:10:20.446
God damn you, you sinister woman!

02:10:22.313 --> 02:10:24.813
You are nonplused of jealousy that
Goncagul will be your husband's wife...

02:10:25.380 --> 02:10:27.413
...so you can not hear yourself!

02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:30.580
My necklace is right here
in this big chest.

02:10:31.813 --> 02:10:35.546
If I hear one more word out of you,
I will kill you!

02:10:38.446 --> 02:10:42.980
If you do not settle this matter,
from now on...

02:10:43.413 --> 02:10:47.646
...you are the second killer
of Aunt Duru to me.

02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:49.313
You should know that!

02:12:23.446 --> 02:12:24.546
You are fast.

02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:26.446
But I am faster than you.

02:12:38.546 --> 02:12:39.946
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:12:40.313 --> 02:12:41.746
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:43.946
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:12:44.446 --> 02:12:45.913
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:47.846
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:12:48.346 --> 02:12:49.880
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:12:50.513 --> 02:12:51.946
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:12:52.513 --> 02:12:53.946
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:12:54.546 --> 02:12:55.946
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:12:56.380 --> 02:12:57.913
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:12:58.513 --> 02:12:59.946
Long live, Gumustekin Bey!

02:13:03.946 --> 02:13:08.780
Apparently, Gundogdu Bey
needs to train you more.

02:13:21.813 --> 02:13:23.246
Is it not so, Ertugrul Bey?

02:13:26.246 --> 02:13:27.513
You are right, Gumustekin Bey.

02:13:29.246 --> 02:13:33.780
I have wanted to train with an adept Alp
like you for so long.

02:13:35.846 --> 02:13:37.180
With your permission.

02:13:37.846 --> 02:13:39.480
Permission granted, Ertugrul Bey.

02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:12.180
Something is going on, indeed.

02:14:12.846 --> 02:14:17.413
If Ertugrul Bey says it is training,
clearly he wants to tame the man.

02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:21.580
Brother, it is high time to tame
this inauspicious man.

02:14:22.180 --> 02:14:23.646
Let us see, what is wrong with our Bey.

02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:12.746
Finally, I have found the right Alp
to train with.

02:15:13.713 --> 02:15:16.513
If God permits, finding the traitor
who terrorized our marquee...

02:15:16.746 --> 02:15:18.580
...will be your destiny as well,
Gumustekin Bey.

02:15:38.913 --> 02:15:40.446
What are you trying to say, Ertugrul Bey?

02:15:40.646 --> 02:15:42.946
I mean the seal stolen from my mother's
marquee, Gumustekin Bey.

02:15:43.913 --> 02:15:45.180
It is such a treason...

02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:48.313
...that one end will stretch to Mongol
and the other streches until Konya.

02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:54.680
It is clear that you have things
to spit out but not able to say.

02:16:19.746 --> 02:16:21.380
I mean Emir Saadettin Kopek.
