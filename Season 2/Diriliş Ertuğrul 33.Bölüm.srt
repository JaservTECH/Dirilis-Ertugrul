00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 33 will start after 11:58 min.

11:58.728 --> 12:02.728
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:03.897 --> 12:07.564
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:08.069 --> 12:11.236
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

12:21.337 --> 12:23.204
You did a lot of things for us.

12:31.771 --> 12:32.837
I spare your life.

12:35.737 --> 12:37.671
But do not get in my way again, Ertugrul.

12:39.737 --> 12:41.471
Or I will be your angel of death.

12:42.271 --> 12:43.371
Treacherous dogs!

12:45.104 --> 12:47.004
Kill me! Kill me!

12:48.104 --> 12:49.837
I would not kill a one-handed man.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.271
Tie him up!

13:11.737 --> 13:14.171
If I do not put your heads on my spear
and walk around with them

13:14.871 --> 13:17.037
I shall not be known
as the son of Suleyman Shah.

13:18.671 --> 13:20.671
If God permits, you will not fall prey
to the wolves, Ertugrul.

13:21.437 --> 13:22.804
These mountains are not safe.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.337
Greetings to your brother Gundogdu.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.304
I will take his life soon.

13:30.971 --> 13:34.004
You time is running out, Noyan's dog.

13:36.937 --> 13:39.004
We are leaving, Alps! Come on!

13:55.404 --> 13:59.171
God, give me my sword hand back.

14:00.771 --> 14:02.304
God, do not humiliate me
in front of my enemies.

14:45.704 --> 14:46.771
Where are the tracks?

15:02.204 --> 15:05.304
Tugtekin, we will find them. Do not worry.

15:07.037 --> 15:08.971
This is happening because of Ertugrul!

15:12.004 --> 15:13.837
We should have executed
Abdurrahman and Hamza!

15:14.071 --> 15:15.171
We should have done it!

15:16.437 --> 15:20.204
We will do what is necessary
for our nomad tent.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.271
Calm down a little.

15:28.404 --> 15:29.804
Come on, we are heading back
to nomad tent.

16:17.137 --> 16:18.304
You are my Johnny-on-the-spot, Geyikli.

16:19.071 --> 16:21.071
You are everywhere.

16:27.904 --> 16:31.471
We must see who sends a Johnny
to those in need.

16:32.671 --> 16:34.771
Thank you. May you live long.

16:38.404 --> 16:40.471
Cranes brought news from bastard Noyan.

16:41.437 --> 16:45.371
He is back from Ogeday's place.
He wants to cause trouble to nomad tent.

16:46.471 --> 16:48.137
We will cause trouble to him first.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.804
I need to free Abdurrahman. Good bye.

17:08.471 --> 17:12.304
We wanted to be united
but they stabbed us in the back.

17:12.837 --> 17:13.904
We shared our food

17:14.171 --> 17:17.371
and tents but peace has left
our nomad tent.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.471
Peace must be restored
in the nomad tent, Korkut Bey.

17:21.437 --> 17:24.171
Or you will lose Dodurga because of Kayi.

17:29.904 --> 17:34.804
Beys, you all knew there could be problems
when you accepted unity.

17:35.704 --> 17:38.237
Despite all possible problems,
we decided to unite.

17:38.971 --> 17:40.337
We cannot turn back.

17:44.737 --> 17:45.937
You have nothing to worry about.

17:47.004 --> 17:50.037
You filled your pockets
thanks to Kayi's casualties.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.404
Impertinent! I will cut your tongue off!

17:54.471 --> 17:55.804
Know your place!

17:58.704 --> 17:59.971
This is my headquarters!

18:13.371 --> 18:15.237
Kayis must pay for their treachery.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.237
Or there will be a blood bath.

18:18.671 --> 18:20.271
We want pound of flesh!

18:38.871 --> 18:41.804
Beys in Korkut Bey's marquee
will want pound of flesh from us.

18:45.737 --> 18:48.137
We paid the price before,
so we will pay this too.

18:53.004 --> 18:54.437
We will pay the price

18:55.804 --> 18:58.437
but how will we clear this traitor mark?

19:02.671 --> 19:04.304
We fought many enemies

19:05.837 --> 19:07.904
but none of them hurt me
as much as Hamza did.

19:09.471 --> 19:13.771
What if he was the traitor since
the beginning and led us to slaughter?

19:15.904 --> 19:18.437
Hamza became like this
because of his anger to Gundogdu.

19:21.304 --> 19:22.437
What will we do, Mother?

19:26.771 --> 19:29.771
What does Kayi tribe think
about remigration?

19:33.071 --> 19:36.404
Migration for Kayi is like running
towards Azrael.

19:39.137 --> 19:43.837
We have neither strength
nor goods to migrate.

19:50.937 --> 19:52.971
God, please help us.

20:18.171 --> 20:19.171
Tugtekin!

20:20.971 --> 20:22.471
Every treachery has a price.

20:23.371 --> 20:25.237
The price will be paid sooner or later.

20:26.104 --> 20:27.171
Price?

20:27.837 --> 20:29.171
You call this price?

20:30.237 --> 20:33.437
We already paid a price by sharing
our food and nomad tent with you.

21:00.437 --> 21:01.737
What is the situation, Tugtekin?

21:03.871 --> 21:04.871
The situation is...

21:05.371 --> 21:07.137
Kayi Alps now belong to Noyan.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.304
Every Kayi in nomad tent
can take Noyan's side someday.

21:15.337 --> 21:17.171
How can we live with all these traitors?

21:19.171 --> 21:21.704
Dodurga Beys yielded to their anger.

21:22.071 --> 21:23.904
They throw the baby out
with the bathwater.

21:24.904 --> 21:28.737
I say that Kayis must resign
from their duties in headquarters...

21:31.971 --> 21:33.771
...or their Alps must hand over
their swords

21:34.771 --> 21:36.237
and Abdurrahman must be executed.

21:41.237 --> 21:43.404
That means Kayis will be our equerries.

21:44.071 --> 21:45.737
They cannot be even our equerries.

21:46.437 --> 21:48.337
If they herd our animals,
that would be enough.

21:51.204 --> 21:52.271
What do you think, Bey?

22:05.971 --> 22:06.971
Bey?

22:09.204 --> 22:10.371
-Oh God!
-Father!

22:11.071 --> 22:12.237
-Bey!
-Father!

22:12.937 --> 22:14.071
Help!

22:15.804 --> 22:16.904
Let him breathe!

22:17.737 --> 22:18.737
Are you alright, Bey?

22:19.804 --> 22:21.837
-Take off his caftan!
-Bring water!

22:22.737 --> 22:23.837
-Bey!
-Bring water!

22:25.037 --> 22:26.037
Bey!

22:55.876 --> 22:59.309
In conclusion,
Tugtekin lost his trust to us.

23:01.509 --> 23:02.542
How could he not?

23:03.642 --> 23:05.742
From now on, how could
we look at his face?

23:06.209 --> 23:07.209
Stop there.

23:07.842 --> 23:11.409
Having a treacher in a nomad tent does
not make whole nomad people treacher.

23:12.309 --> 23:14.542
Who knows how many treachers
are there in their nomad tent?

23:16.842 --> 23:18.409
I wish there was only a treacher.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.676
We have disturbed peace
since the day we came.

23:26.176 --> 23:27.842
I am surprised by

23:29.242 --> 23:34.409
how could we did not see what they did?

23:35.242 --> 23:37.476
I said we should not have migrated,
you did not listen.

23:38.442 --> 23:41.309
If we herd our animals in wild lands
wolves and jackals

23:41.842 --> 23:43.876
will lay an ambush for sure.

23:49.542 --> 23:51.109
They would want pound of flesh.

23:52.209 --> 23:53.709
They will make us pay for it.

23:56.509 --> 23:58.276
We will pay whatever it is, Crazy Iron.

24:33.376 --> 24:37.142
You are exhausted, Bey.
Your heart needs calmness.

24:38.776 --> 24:43.876
Instead of living in peace at his age,
he is struggling with troubles.

24:45.176 --> 24:47.176
Kayis cause him real troubles.

24:59.876 --> 25:01.109
<i>Permission, Bey?</i>

25:01.709 --> 25:02.776
Come in!

25:06.809 --> 25:08.142
Ertugrul is here, Bey.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.876
So he is here to die.
Get Alps ready quickly.

25:16.142 --> 25:17.209
Do not you hear me?

25:20.476 --> 25:21.509
Yes, Bey.

25:22.576 --> 25:25.509
Do not cause trouble in nomad tent, Bey.
Do not break the traditions.

25:25.776 --> 25:27.176
There is no tradition left, Artuk.

25:31.642 --> 25:32.642
Tugtekin.

25:34.576 --> 25:37.109
What you are going to do
will make enemy stronger.

25:38.476 --> 25:41.709
First, cut them in pieces,
then you will eat them.

25:46.476 --> 25:47.476
Son.

25:51.109 --> 25:52.109
Son.

25:56.842 --> 25:57.842
Father.

26:00.576 --> 26:01.609
My dear father.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.309
Does Bey drink this syrup?

26:21.242 --> 26:23.276
This will cause his death at this age.

26:31.342 --> 26:33.642
Leave me alone with sons of Suleyman Shah.

26:58.476 --> 26:59.476
Come closer.

27:08.276 --> 27:09.709
Look me in the eye both of you.

27:16.242 --> 27:17.876
I did not raise you for this.

27:23.176 --> 27:26.509
If your father my Suleyman Shah were alive

27:26.742 --> 27:28.842
what would he have
said to your impertinence?

27:30.076 --> 27:31.242
What would he have said?

27:35.709 --> 27:37.342
We faced many troubles.

27:39.176 --> 27:40.676
We defeated many evils.

27:41.609 --> 27:45.609
We need unity and peace!
What did you do?

27:47.242 --> 27:49.176
How could you face the community?

27:57.409 --> 27:58.642
From now on

27:59.809 --> 28:02.542
if you lay a hand on each other

28:03.809 --> 28:07.209
you will have neither my love
nor my blessing!

28:12.276 --> 28:13.442
Did you hear my words?

28:21.776 --> 28:23.342
Hug and ask for blessing.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.342
Give me your blessing, brother.

28:33.542 --> 28:34.709
You have it.

28:35.209 --> 28:37.409
Give me your blessing, too, brother.
-You have it.

28:53.342 --> 28:54.342
Sit down.

29:03.309 --> 29:04.776
Tell me about Hamza problem.

31:19.776 --> 31:24.409
Strength is a desire erupting
from a man's veins.

31:26.276 --> 31:30.709
But gold is a cheap
odalisque of that desire.

31:32.476 --> 31:36.176
I know none of you wants this gold.

31:38.209 --> 31:42.676
You are here to fight in the
strongest army of the world

31:43.776 --> 31:48.376
and be a soldier of largest army
in the world.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.609
To battle!

31:52.709 --> 31:54.142
To take off heads!

31:56.142 --> 32:00.809
But if you have desire for gold

32:01.742 --> 32:05.276
come and get as much as you want.

32:08.609 --> 32:11.676
I give all the gold I have if he wants.

32:17.376 --> 32:21.676
You are not cheap men
who set off for gold.

32:24.876 --> 32:29.242
You are the best warriors
this world ever seen.

32:31.476 --> 32:32.642
You are Kayi Alps.

32:35.776 --> 32:41.242
Now you are to serve Mongols

32:42.676 --> 32:47.342
who are your brothers for thousands
of years and world's sultan Ogeday.

32:49.309 --> 32:51.576
This is a holy meeting.

32:53.509 --> 32:59.442
The meeting of world's best warriors
and biggest emperor of the world.

33:03.309 --> 33:04.509
Welcome among us.

33:11.276 --> 33:14.509
From now on, you are not my soldier

33:16.609 --> 33:18.109
but my blood brother.

36:01.609 --> 36:02.642
No permission.

36:03.242 --> 36:06.109
I did not ask for permission. Move aside.
We will enter.

36:06.509 --> 36:07.509
Turgut!

36:09.442 --> 36:10.776
Obey Tugtekin Bey's words.

36:13.276 --> 36:14.709
Obey so we will not have a problem.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.409
We obey the Beys' words.

36:22.476 --> 36:23.609
We brought food.

36:24.309 --> 36:25.542
Let him eat something.

36:37.476 --> 36:38.476
Go in.

36:39.509 --> 36:41.709
But do it quick.

36:51.242 --> 36:52.276
Brothers!

36:53.309 --> 36:54.876
We brought you food, brother.

37:09.509 --> 37:10.609
What is the situation?

37:11.309 --> 37:12.776
They said Hamza is a treacher.

37:16.176 --> 37:17.209
It is right.

37:18.642 --> 37:20.109
He turned out a Mongol spy.

37:22.409 --> 37:24.076
Maybe, he was the treacher
since the beginning.

37:24.442 --> 37:25.876
He led the nomad people to slaughter.

37:31.142 --> 37:33.276
They want to project their rage onto me.

37:42.409 --> 37:45.609
As long as Ertugrul Bey is here
as long as we are here

37:46.242 --> 37:48.209
they could not harm a hair on your head.

37:49.842 --> 37:51.175
Do not worry.

38:00.576 --> 38:03.376
Brother, you must
take care of your health.

38:04.175 --> 38:07.409
If something happens to you,
people will be perished.

38:09.676 --> 38:12.776
Hayme, people are already perished.

38:14.442 --> 38:15.476
All Beys ask

38:16.109 --> 38:18.476
is this the reward of helping Kayi

38:19.342 --> 38:21.809
what if other Kayis are treachers?

38:22.776 --> 38:24.142
What else they say?

38:26.176 --> 38:29.576
They say, we have no peace
and order has been broken.

38:32.709 --> 38:34.542
So, what are saying to all these?

38:36.442 --> 38:39.609
My dear sister, I need to calm Beys down.

38:40.542 --> 38:42.376
To do this you must pay a price.

38:43.476 --> 38:45.109
Abdicate from headquarters

38:45.809 --> 38:48.309
or let your Alps lay down their arms.

38:51.809 --> 38:52.876
Brother!

38:54.176 --> 38:59.342
Your Beys want to see us as shepherd
and Kayi as herd.

39:01.209 --> 39:03.842
They want Kayi to serve them. Is it?

39:06.109 --> 39:09.509
My Beys behaved themselves till now.

39:10.742 --> 39:14.476
Your son Ertugrul and your nomad people
are the faulty ones.

39:16.109 --> 39:17.709
Or this unity will break down.

39:25.309 --> 39:26.409
You have gone...

39:28.776 --> 39:30.209
...you are speechless.

39:32.409 --> 39:34.209
No one knows what are you thinking.

39:42.476 --> 39:44.209
If my tongue knows what my heart thinks

39:45.476 --> 39:49.276
I cut my tongue
so no one will be in trouble.

39:50.509 --> 39:53.076
We always have a rough ride, Ertugrul.

39:54.142 --> 39:57.442
Tell me, I want to know
what is in your heart.

40:01.876 --> 40:03.142
Just know this.

40:04.342 --> 40:06.242
Mad horses are running wild in my heart.

40:07.609 --> 40:08.742
Passing the seas.

40:10.209 --> 40:11.476
Trebling the very ground.

40:13.142 --> 40:15.276
They run without having had fill.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.242
Away, far away.

40:27.776 --> 40:34.309
These mad horses tell our nomad tent's
name will be known to world someday.

40:36.409 --> 40:38.076
World will be on his knees before us.

40:39.342 --> 40:40.876
Justice will flourish everywhere.

40:42.676 --> 40:44.142
They say world will be ours.

40:46.709 --> 40:48.542
We do not have a nomad tent yet, Ertugrul.

40:50.542 --> 40:52.376
How could all world will be ours?

41:00.076 --> 41:03.876
That is why, I do not tell
what is in my heart to anyone.

41:05.809 --> 41:11.276
Look, even you do not believe
what mad horses told me.

42:05.409 --> 42:10.676
How will we defeat all this evil
and trouble, Tugtekin?

42:12.476 --> 42:14.209
Sow the wind and reap the
whirlwind, Gokce.

42:15.309 --> 42:17.409
We Turks are here to make
these lands our homeland.

42:18.742 --> 42:23.476
So, we will pay a price
till these lands will be ours.

42:25.176 --> 42:26.309
What is on your mind?

42:28.609 --> 42:30.842
We need to gather nomad people
and take treachers out.

42:33.609 --> 42:34.776
How will it be, Tugtekin?

42:36.509 --> 42:37.576
It will be good.

42:40.276 --> 42:41.842
Do not worry about these.
Let us have a race.

42:43.709 --> 42:44.709
Come on.

43:33.809 --> 43:36.176
While your Alps being treachers

43:37.542 --> 43:39.342
you are enjoying yourself here.

43:40.776 --> 43:43.642
So, you are riding in wilderness
instead of being a Bey

43:44.709 --> 43:46.276
and go after treachers.

43:58.076 --> 43:59.076
Tugtekin.

44:00.576 --> 44:01.576
Let us go.

44:09.276 --> 44:10.276
Tugtekin.

44:11.776 --> 44:13.109
Let us go, Gokce.

44:15.142 --> 44:16.142
Let us go.

44:29.309 --> 44:31.209
I scared too much that you hurt him.

44:32.609 --> 44:36.476
Son of Suleyman Shah, Ertugrul,
does not deal with colt.

45:11.142 --> 45:12.142
Kocabash?

45:13.309 --> 45:16.142
You are a real cook. It is delicious.

45:17.142 --> 45:19.409
We know that big head of yours is cunning

45:21.376 --> 45:22.842
but your hands are skillful, too.

45:24.376 --> 45:25.876
Am I cunning, Bohach brother?

45:27.709 --> 45:30.709
Look at his eyes, they are astute.

45:36.176 --> 45:38.309
Look at them, they never stop.

45:54.076 --> 45:55.176
Turgut and Dogan...

45:57.542 --> 45:59.409
...they came to see the Abdurrahman.

46:01.576 --> 46:02.576
Did they see him?

46:05.076 --> 46:06.176
Samsa let them see.

46:19.876 --> 46:21.176
Samsa!

46:23.409 --> 46:25.409
Brainless, stupid Samsa!

46:58.176 --> 47:01.142
If you do not obey my orders once more,
I make dog food from your flesh.

47:02.676 --> 47:04.642
I told you, do not let them see!

47:25.642 --> 47:29.676
You will breathe down Ertugrul and
his Alps neck on smallest mistakes.

47:30.576 --> 47:31.609
Understood?

47:45.242 --> 47:47.309
Here, this will clean you up.

47:55.576 --> 47:56.576
Stupid!

48:01.742 --> 48:05.209
Korkut Bey wanted us to dismiss
from headquarters

48:06.809 --> 48:08.742
or lay down Alps' arms.

48:11.442 --> 48:12.676
Look at our condition!

48:14.342 --> 48:16.142
I wish the ground would open up
and swallow me.

48:19.476 --> 48:20.676
What is on your mind, Bey?

48:23.276 --> 48:24.609
We will spoil the game with another game.

48:26.109 --> 48:27.576
We will draw Tugtekin upon us.

48:28.609 --> 48:30.742
He is already on our neck
waiting for a mistake.

48:32.076 --> 48:33.709
So we will force him to make a mistake.

48:36.776 --> 48:38.076
What will we do, Bey?

48:40.342 --> 48:42.742
We will show everyone that
Tugtekin is an Alp

48:43.409 --> 48:45.076
who is not bounded to traditions.

49:26.276 --> 49:29.076
You are treachers
and you challenge us now!

49:36.776 --> 49:38.709
You cannot wave a flag here!

50:30.276 --> 50:31.742
My brother is waiting for an answer.

50:32.809 --> 50:34.076
What will we say?

50:36.242 --> 50:38.109
I want to talk to my uncle one last time.

50:44.242 --> 50:45.509
What is happening outside?

50:48.609 --> 50:49.709
<i>Permission?</i>

50:50.076 --> 50:51.109
Come in.

50:53.442 --> 50:55.509
Mother Hayme, Tugtekin Bey...

50:58.276 --> 50:59.542
It is our flag!

51:33.442 --> 51:35.876
Are you only strong enough
for Kayi Bey's legacy, Tugtekin?

51:47.509 --> 51:49.409
Do not forget, this is not a simple cloth.

51:52.209 --> 51:55.709
Raging on an ancestor legacy
does not suit an Alp like you.

51:59.109 --> 52:01.076
So you can still talk without shame.

52:03.209 --> 52:07.242
Did you forget, your Alps betrayed to
their nomad tent and be Noyan's dog!

52:08.476 --> 52:15.276
Instead of being a brother and a father
you are betraying your Alps

52:15.842 --> 52:17.642
who will die by your order.

52:25.609 --> 52:30.709
Will you keep these nomad people united
by making others pay for your faults?

52:48.809 --> 52:50.242
-Ertugrul!
-Tugtekin!

52:51.276 --> 52:52.342
Enough!

52:54.276 --> 52:56.342
Enough! Lay down your sword!

53:01.476 --> 53:03.709
What are you trying to do? Lay it down!

53:07.776 --> 53:09.342
What do we live for?

53:12.809 --> 53:15.842
What do we fight for and be a martyr?

53:24.176 --> 53:26.576
In this world which we could not control

53:27.609 --> 53:30.809
why do we go to endless battles?

53:37.342 --> 53:40.876
To trample on our ancestors' legacies...

53:44.076 --> 53:48.776
...or keep that legacy over our heads!

54:18.242 --> 54:19.676
Do not let our legacy
become forlorn, brother.

55:30.242 --> 55:31.242
Tugtekin.

55:33.109 --> 55:34.542
You behaved shamefully.

56:26.176 --> 56:30.309
We trusted Tugtekin and gave him
commandership of Alps, but...

56:30.776 --> 56:32.576
Tugtekin has crossed the line this time.

56:35.242 --> 56:38.409
Ertugrul behaved Tugtekin as he deserved.

56:41.209 --> 56:46.276
So he saved your,
my and your father honor.

56:47.476 --> 56:50.509
You speak the truth, Mother.
Tugtekin has crossed the line.

56:51.576 --> 56:56.076
But it is our Alps who stabbed Tugtekin
in the back Ertugrul's Alps.

56:59.076 --> 57:00.542
Things would not have come this far.

57:02.209 --> 57:04.876
If we do not keep unity in nomad tent

57:06.176 --> 57:09.242
we will finish ourselves before Mongols.

57:10.809 --> 57:12.376
Just like Cain and Abel.

57:24.276 --> 57:26.509
How long will you let him crush me...

57:28.842 --> 57:30.076
...father?

57:30.742 --> 57:34.842
We need to handle this situation quietly.

57:36.442 --> 57:38.409
He who gets up in anger,
sits down with a loss.

57:39.076 --> 57:40.276
I could not believe you.

57:41.409 --> 57:42.842
You are still favoring him.

57:44.476 --> 57:46.642
He humiliated me in front of everyone.

57:47.609 --> 57:49.376
You are still favoring him, father.

57:52.476 --> 57:54.076
My aunt and him.

57:55.276 --> 57:58.376
He is not just someone.
Do not you understand?

57:59.642 --> 58:01.176
You always favored Ertugrul!

58:02.409 --> 58:05.076
You always thought he is better than me!
You still do!

58:05.242 --> 58:09.509
His Alps betrayed and followed Noyan!
You are still defending him!

58:10.176 --> 58:11.209
Still!

58:12.342 --> 58:14.209
Do you know why all these
have happened, father?

58:15.176 --> 58:17.442
Do you know why all these
have happened, father?

58:18.309 --> 58:19.542
Because of you!

58:20.076 --> 58:23.342
Because of you! You always favored him!

58:25.176 --> 58:26.376
Now, answer me!

58:27.276 --> 58:29.342
Do you favor Ertugrul
because you love him

58:31.176 --> 58:32.742
or because you are afraid of him?

58:34.642 --> 58:37.476
Tell me, father. Are you afraid of him?

58:38.242 --> 58:41.142
Tell me, are you afraid of him?

58:56.776 --> 58:59.176
Ertugrul would have never
humiliated himself

58:59.476 --> 59:03.242
by hauling down the flag of a nomad tribe
and stepping on it!

59:05.709 --> 59:11.442
But you are too weak
and stupid to see this!

59:13.776 --> 59:14.776
Get out!

59:16.209 --> 59:17.209
Out!

59:20.609 --> 59:21.609
Now!

59:50.709 --> 59:51.709
Bey.

59:52.809 --> 59:55.542
Tugtekin's dignity is Dodurga's dignity.

59:56.376 --> 59:58.276
So, it your dignity.

00:59:59.576 --> 01:00:01.709
You must restore Tugtekin's dignity.

01:00:02.876 --> 01:00:05.742
You must bring rebellious Kayi Alps
into the line.

01:00:08.242 --> 01:00:12.842
Every move I made comes right back at me
in these rough times, Aytolun.

01:00:14.542 --> 01:00:16.509
Do not see it?
-I see it, Bey.

01:00:17.476 --> 01:00:21.209
But, we must teach Ertugrul a lesson.

01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:26.776
Or he will fetter you
instead of obeying you.

01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:31.542
How will do that, Aytolun? How?

01:00:32.642 --> 01:00:35.142
On one side my dear sister Hayme.

01:00:35.542 --> 01:00:38.242
On the other side cherry of
Oghuz's cheek, Ertugrul.

01:00:39.576 --> 01:00:40.676
Is it easy?

01:00:41.509 --> 01:00:43.342
Execute Abdurrahman.

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:47.409
You enjoy the best of both worlds.

01:00:47.842 --> 01:00:49.676
So, Dodurga people will be happy

01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:53.576
and Kayi people will pay a price.

01:01:16.242 --> 01:01:17.242
What is happening?

01:01:18.076 --> 01:01:19.642
-What are you doing?
-Move aside!

01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:23.176
-What do you want from Abdurrahman?
-Move aside!

01:01:23.342 --> 01:01:25.642
-Move aside! Move aside!
-Take your hands off me!

01:01:26.342 --> 01:01:28.842
Tell me who send you and
what you want from Abdurrahman?

01:01:31.442 --> 01:01:32.776
Move aside, Korkut Bey's orders!

01:01:51.242 --> 01:01:52.409
What do you want?

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:54.209
Your time is up, Abdurrahman.

01:02:03.176 --> 01:02:04.609
Why are you grinning, treacher?

01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:09.509
Neither your Bey nor you can tell me
my time is up.

01:02:10.409 --> 01:02:11.809
But God can.

01:02:13.742 --> 01:02:19.776
Will you talk like this while a horse
is dragging your carcass?

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:27.642
Move! Move!

01:02:47.746 --> 01:02:50.380
Bey, it is as you wished.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.113
It wraps around your hand and wrist.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.280
I hope it will heal you.

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.380
My thanks to you.

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.980
Now I do not have a lame hand,
but a hand made of steel.

01:03:12.046 --> 01:03:13.046
In the name of God.

01:03:39.246 --> 01:03:40.313
Wonderful, Bey.

01:03:42.546 --> 01:03:43.546
Wonderful.

01:03:57.113 --> 01:03:59.413
Bey, you told me to tell you
if anything is wrong.

01:03:59.713 --> 01:04:00.746
What happened?

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.313
They have come to take Abdurrahman, Bey.
Their intentions are bad.

01:04:22.513 --> 01:04:23.780
-Let him go!
-Let him go!

01:04:31.013 --> 01:04:32.646
-Let him go!
-You cannot take him!

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:36.313
We will not give up Abdurrahman!

01:04:37.446 --> 01:04:38.680
-Let him go!
-Is it bad, brothers?

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:42.080
It is my Bey who will decide
whether away it is good or bad.

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:46.146
Don't do it, brother.
God will punish you.

01:04:47.146 --> 01:04:48.480
He will smite you.

01:04:49.346 --> 01:04:51.013
All good and all bad, come from God.

01:04:53.346 --> 01:04:54.380
Move over!

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.780
Stop!

01:05:29.046 --> 01:05:30.080
Lay down your swords.

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.180
You insolent men!

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.180
If you draw your sword
against your brother today

01:05:46.113 --> 01:05:48.146
you will be kneeling
to the heathens tomorrow.

01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:54.980
It is the Bey's order.

01:05:55.646 --> 01:05:57.113
We will take him, Ertugrul Bey.

01:05:57.513 --> 01:06:00.313
-Where will you take him?
-He will be executed in the training area.

01:06:02.246 --> 01:06:04.013
-You cannot take him!
-We won’t let you.

01:06:04.413 --> 01:06:05.446
Let him go!

01:06:09.313 --> 01:06:10.546
Abdurrahman is innocent!

01:06:13.446 --> 01:06:14.713
Abdurrahman is innocent!

01:06:15.646 --> 01:06:16.713
Abdurrahman is innocent!

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.313
Abdurrahman is innocent!

01:06:19.546 --> 01:06:21.313
Enough! Enough.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.046
We will abide by...

01:06:32.013 --> 01:06:33.146
...the tribunal's judgment.

01:06:45.046 --> 01:06:46.046
Bey.

01:06:46.746 --> 01:06:48.313
We will respect the tribunal's judgment.

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:58.413
Take him!

01:07:33.346 --> 01:07:36.680
He has been scheming with his Alps
day and night since he returned.

01:07:37.446 --> 01:07:40.613
He meets with someone secretly outside the
nomad tent. I’m sure of it.

01:07:41.713 --> 01:07:42.713
Who?

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.280
I will find out soon, Bey.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:04.413
Is he in?

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.146
Yes, Aytolun Hatun.

01:08:07.746 --> 01:08:10.546
-How is he?
-He would kill them all if we let him.

01:08:20.346 --> 01:08:21.346
Mother?

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:30.113
Your father gave the order
to execute Abdurrahman.

01:08:31.746 --> 01:08:33.080
So, he recognized his mistake.

01:08:35.313 --> 01:08:39.346
After he humiliated me,
he came to his senses.

01:08:43.013 --> 01:08:44.480
Perhaps, someone helped him
come to his senses.

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:49.580
You and your father have overcome every
obstacle to establish a great dominion.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.980
The news we are expecting from
Sultan Aleaddin will come shortly.

01:08:55.013 --> 01:08:57.413
We will build up strength in our lands.

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.746
Your only duty is to be patient, Tugtekin.

01:09:03.746 --> 01:09:05.980
How will I do that
while Ertugrul is here?

01:09:07.013 --> 01:09:11.280
Ertugrul's dignity will soon be damaged,
just like his hand, Tugtekin.

01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:16.580
As your father always says,
we will handle matters quietly.

01:09:18.713 --> 01:09:25.113
Now go and make Ertugrul's Alps
pay the price of betrayal.

01:09:26.113 --> 01:09:29.646
Show them that a man with a lame hand
cannot alter your destiny.

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.313
Brother, how could you do this?

01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:43.513
How could you give an execution order
without my knowledge?

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:48.680
I was just carrying out the decision taken
by the tribunal in two nomad tents

01:09:50.646 --> 01:09:52.213
It’s the right time for the execution.

01:09:53.613 --> 01:09:55.746
Or things will get out of control.

01:09:57.313 --> 01:10:00.513
You cannot take my Alp's life
just for intimidating people.

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:05.113
I will decide when he will be executed.

01:10:05.513 --> 01:10:08.780
That was before your Alps betrayed us,
do not forget that.

01:10:09.613 --> 01:10:12.380
If my son or I suffer another blow,

01:10:13.446 --> 01:10:14.746
this partnership of ours will end.

01:10:15.413 --> 01:10:17.480
And everyone will have to fend
for themselves.

01:10:23.413 --> 01:10:25.146
This is what it finally comes to.

01:10:26.246 --> 01:10:29.446
To hell with him and his partnership!

01:10:37.713 --> 01:10:39.780
Your father entrusted Abdurrahman to us.

01:10:42.146 --> 01:10:46.513
How can I protect his legacy,
If I cannot even protect Abdurrahman?

01:10:53.246 --> 01:10:54.246
Who knows...

01:10:56.313 --> 01:10:58.613
...perhaps I am not worthy of his legacy.

01:11:03.313 --> 01:11:05.613
Not at all, mother. That’s not true.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.513
It is your presence
that holds us together.

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.613
We are torn asunder as never before.

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:17.746
How long?

01:11:19.313 --> 01:11:20.513
How long will this last?

01:11:26.046 --> 01:11:29.680
You know Abdurrahman is innocent, right?

01:11:34.346 --> 01:11:37.013
We also thought Hamza would
never betray us, mother.

01:11:38.413 --> 01:11:42.180
I don’t know who to trust
or what to believe anymore.

01:11:51.513 --> 01:11:52.980
Go and bring me Ertugrul.

01:11:56.046 --> 01:11:57.080
Yes, mother.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.280
Uncle!

01:12:45.246 --> 01:12:47.180
Are you here to call me
to account, Ertugrul?

01:12:48.713 --> 01:12:51.480
I keep wondering what happened,
to the brave uncle I once knew?

01:12:53.546 --> 01:12:56.380
Ertugrul, be careful with your words.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.980
Do you want to execute my Alp
because you cannot execute me?

01:13:02.513 --> 01:13:06.513
Will you cover up Tugtekin's stupidity
with the blood of my Alp?

01:13:06.746 --> 01:13:07.980
Ertugrul!

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.213
The brave uncle I know and love
has enough honor to avoid this.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.780
Be careful whose advice you are taking.

01:13:16.413 --> 01:13:20.413
Understand that the rage in you
is leading us to the edge of a cliff!

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:23.413
Look what you have done to
two nomad groups!

01:13:24.713 --> 01:13:26.113
Where is your conscience?

01:13:27.013 --> 01:13:28.180
Stop this execution, uncle.

01:13:29.213 --> 01:13:30.313
Abdurrahman is innocent.

01:13:31.346 --> 01:13:35.013
Do not kill a brave Alp
because of your anger towards me.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.180
Or you will be worthless to my Alps.

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.546
The tribunal's judgment will be obeyed.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.146
Abdurrahman will be executed.

01:13:45.446 --> 01:13:47.580
You did not give me any other
option, Ertugrul.

01:13:49.113 --> 01:13:50.980
Maybe, from now on,
you will know your place.

01:13:51.713 --> 01:13:55.480
When did you become so cruel
and thoughtless?

01:13:56.746 --> 01:13:58.346
Or do you have a secret agenda?

01:13:59.446 --> 01:14:03.146
If you have, I will bring that
secret agenda to light one day, uncle.

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:07.280
Stop this execution
while there is still time!

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.013
Ertugrul, get out!

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:14.246
Do not make me do things
we will both regret!

01:14:16.213 --> 01:14:17.680
Get out! Right away!

01:14:42.646 --> 01:14:44.980
-Traitor!
-Kill him!

01:14:48.213 --> 01:14:50.046
-Traitor!
-Kill that man!

01:14:50.546 --> 01:14:51.746
Kill him!

01:15:00.313 --> 01:15:02.646
Kill him!

01:15:20.046 --> 01:15:22.980
Turgut, tell me Ertugrul Bey
will not let them do this.

01:15:23.513 --> 01:15:24.646
Kill him!

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.546
Kill him!

01:15:54.246 --> 01:15:56.513
We cannot let them execute
Abdurrahman.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.246
They want their payment, mother.

01:16:00.646 --> 01:16:01.713
Then let us pay the price.

01:16:07.613 --> 01:16:08.680
What are you going to do?

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.446
Traitor!

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.780
Don't do that!

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.180
They can’t do that.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.080
To hell with this brotherhood.

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:34.780
Uncle!

01:17:55.346 --> 01:17:57.380
If you will delay the execution

01:17:58.313 --> 01:18:00.246
our Alps are ready to lay down
their weapons.

01:18:04.113 --> 01:18:05.380
But we have only one wish.

01:18:09.646 --> 01:18:12.113
Let Mother Hayme give
the order to execute Abdurrahman.

01:18:33.346 --> 01:18:34.446
If that is what you wish.

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:35.980
Father.

01:18:36.713 --> 01:18:38.713
Don't do this. Give the execution order.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.413
I am delaying the execution!

01:19:04.146 --> 01:19:05.446
Thank God!

01:19:09.546 --> 01:19:11.113
The execution has been postponed!

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:15.113
May God bless you.

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:18.046
Untie the prisoner and take him
to his cage.

01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:56.546
Long live Korkut Bey!

01:19:57.013 --> 01:19:58.213
Long live Korkut Bey!

01:19:58.380 --> 01:19:59.613
Long live Korkut Bey!

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.780
Long live Korkut Bey!

01:20:08.313 --> 01:20:09.446
Long live Korkut Bey!

01:20:10.780 --> 01:20:12.013
May God bless you.

01:20:13.646 --> 01:20:14.780
Long live Korkut Bey!

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.746
Long live Korkut Bey!

01:20:24.113 --> 01:20:25.213
Long live Korkut Bey!

01:21:19.113 --> 01:21:21.246
Well done! Well done!

01:21:44.313 --> 01:21:46.646
-Have you brought news from Kayis?
-Yes.

01:21:52.213 --> 01:21:53.246
Speak.

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.613
Everything went as planned.

01:22:06.513 --> 01:22:09.013
So, they are in disarray, Tangut.

01:22:09.546 --> 01:22:11.480
Abdurrahman will be executed
sooner or later.

01:22:12.513 --> 01:22:14.246
And Kayi Alps will bear a grudge.

01:22:15.713 --> 01:22:16.746
Ertugrul, too.

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:21.046
He will be mad with rage.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:25.513
Then every bond that ties
the two nomad groups together will break.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.313
I told you, Tankut.

01:22:29.146 --> 01:22:30.980
You stir up the Turks
and then let them be.

01:22:32.746 --> 01:22:33.980
Let them be

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:37.380
so that they will consume each other.

01:23:27.513 --> 01:23:28.546
Sisters?

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.013
Do your work, instead of gossiping!

01:23:50.346 --> 01:23:51.546
You girls go to the loom.

01:23:57.646 --> 01:23:59.613
What do you think about
what happened, Gokce?

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.246
The price of treachery will be paid
sooner or later, Aytolun Hatun.

01:24:07.246 --> 01:24:08.746
Or the price will be even greater.

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:15.146
So, explain this to Tugtekin
with your silver tongue.

01:24:17.546 --> 01:24:21.213
He is still furious with
your brother, Ertugrul.

01:24:24.146 --> 01:24:28.680
Go, I’m sure he will feel better
if you are with him.

01:25:21.113 --> 01:25:22.413
You were right to be angry.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:26.180
You were betrayed.

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:30.046
Bu you ended up being wrong
when you were right.

01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:38.080
They insulted you.

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.413
You insulted Kayis, too.

01:25:46.046 --> 01:25:47.046
I know, I made a mistake.

01:25:49.346 --> 01:25:53.746
But Ertugrul insulted me
like no one else has ever done.

01:25:55.313 --> 01:25:56.346
Not just you...

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.180
...he does it to everyone.

01:26:03.113 --> 01:26:04.613
He breaks people's heart without thinking.

01:26:06.646 --> 01:26:09.580
He doesn’t  care about

01:26:11.546 --> 01:26:13.313
people's love and dignity.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.680
Why are you so furious with your brother?

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:26.480
Because...

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.246
Because we do not deserve this.

01:27:07.546 --> 01:27:08.613
Let's stop this bickering.

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.146
That’s all I want.

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:15.080
Don’t worry.

01:27:16.313 --> 01:27:17.313
It will end.

01:28:24.313 --> 01:28:25.513
Well done, my daughter-in-law.

01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:34.480
You made it at last.

01:28:37.313 --> 01:28:39.213
You are free to do as you please
in the nomad tent.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.313
Selcan Hatun!

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:48.980
If it was not for your husband,
you all would be in pieces by now.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.713
Thank God, you have a Bey like Gundogdu.

01:28:56.613 --> 01:28:59.513
It’s a miracle that a brave
and honorable man like him

01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:04.046
puts up with a woman like you,
even for one day!

01:29:51.613 --> 01:29:54.146
The world's best warriors are among them.

01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:03.046
I want all of them in my army, Hamza.

01:30:05.546 --> 01:30:07.613
They all will fight for you
when the time comes.

01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:39.780
Don’t worry.

01:30:42.013 --> 01:30:43.213
Hamza is with us now.

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:46.246
Your secret is safe.

01:30:49.013 --> 01:30:50.046
Right, Hamza?

01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:57.213
I have good news for you.

01:30:58.246 --> 01:31:01.713
Ertugrul will leave the nomad group
in order to preserve unity.

01:31:05.613 --> 01:31:07.513
Ertugrul will never leave his nomad group.

01:31:18.246 --> 01:31:22.046
What happens to a wounded wolf
when he leaves his pack?

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:35.246
If you make a sound,
I will cut your throat.

01:32:36.213 --> 01:32:37.246
Rise.

01:32:38.213 --> 01:32:39.213
Rise!

01:32:49.546 --> 01:32:51.080
Did you think you could get away?

01:33:08.246 --> 01:33:09.246
Step up on the log.

01:33:10.746 --> 01:33:11.780
Step up on the log!

01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.680
If you sleep, move, or try to escape,

01:34:01.513 --> 01:34:04.146
you will die by hanging.
Do you understand?

01:34:10.346 --> 01:34:11.513
No one will come in.

01:35:19.346 --> 01:35:20.346
What happened, Bey?

01:35:21.113 --> 01:35:23.413
You will go to Geyikli's cave with Dogan
tomorrow morning.

01:35:24.613 --> 01:35:26.113
You will wait there for my news.

01:35:28.446 --> 01:35:29.513
All right, Bey.

01:35:32.080 --> 01:35:33.213
What about Abdurrahman?

01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:38.213
You are leaving the nomad tent, too.

01:35:39.413 --> 01:35:40.446
To leave him like this...

01:35:41.046 --> 01:35:42.046
Don’t worry.

01:35:43.413 --> 01:35:45.146
I will send him to Geyikli's cave.

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.513
What's on your mind, Bey?

01:35:53.213 --> 01:35:54.380
Why aren't you telling us?

01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:57.646
Don't you trust us?

01:35:58.446 --> 01:36:00.313
You have not told us anything
for a long time.

01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:02.513
If you know all my secrets
you can hurt me.

01:36:04.013 --> 01:36:07.380
I know that the enemy could never
break your tongue or your heart.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.480
But the ones who oppose us are
not our enemies.

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.780
They mean more to us than our own lives.

01:36:17.046 --> 01:36:20.380
From now on, the less you know,
the better.

01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.280
Understood?

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:26.546
Understood, Bey.

01:36:27.113 --> 01:36:28.246
As you wish, Bey.

01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:31.280
Now go and get ready.

01:36:32.346 --> 01:36:34.180
I want you to set out
early in the morning.

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:40.246
Do you want anything from me, Bey?

01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:45.713
-I do, Wild Demir.
-Yes, Bey.

01:37:14.146 --> 01:37:17.013
You are the bride every mother in law
would want.

01:37:19.546 --> 01:37:21.980
If God permits, we will see those days.

01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:41.580
Gokce is about finish the armor
you requested.

01:37:42.613 --> 01:37:44.980
But she needs more materials.

01:37:45.413 --> 01:37:48.413
You will buy them when you
go to Erzurum together.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.313
Right, Gokce?

01:37:54.013 --> 01:37:55.046
I had better be off to bed.

01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:57.646
You might have things to talk about.

01:38:00.113 --> 01:38:01.180
Good night.

01:38:10.246 --> 01:38:11.246
Wait a minute.

01:38:13.713 --> 01:38:15.013
Let's talk for a little while.

01:38:28.046 --> 01:38:29.380
You came to me and talked with me.

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:32.113
Thank you.

01:38:32.646 --> 01:38:33.713
What happened, Bey?

01:38:35.346 --> 01:38:36.446
You calmed me down.

01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:40.080
You prevented my anger from hurting me.

01:38:42.246 --> 01:38:44.780
From now on, I have someone
who understand my words and my heart.

01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.480
Thank God.

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.146
Peace be upon God.

01:39:14.513 --> 01:39:15.546
Who was that?

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:19.980
-Gokce.
-In the dead of night?

01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:22.046
What does she want?

01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:35.180
Young people cannot stand not
seeing each other.

01:39:38.713 --> 01:39:40.280
I mean Tugtekin and Gokce.

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:43.780
They are well matched.

01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:46.680
Tugtekin talked to me.

01:39:48.013 --> 01:39:50.546
He respects and loves me
as his late mother.

01:39:51.646 --> 01:39:52.780
He is in love with the girl.

01:39:55.246 --> 01:39:58.180
-What about Gokce?
-They will go to Erzurum together.

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:03.180
When they return,
we’ll find out what she thinks.

01:40:06.313 --> 01:40:08.180
So, what does Hayme think about this?

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:14.413
If the daughter of Suleyman Shah and
the son of Korkut Bey were to marry

01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.046
that would mean two marriages, not one.

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:22.413
So Dodurgas and Kayis
would be solemnly married.

01:41:12.413 --> 01:41:14.046
Where will all of this end?

01:41:17.713 --> 01:41:19.146
We are suffering

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:23.046
because of our unborn babies.

01:41:30.646 --> 01:41:32.046
If you run away

01:41:33.513 --> 01:41:35.080
if you turn your back on me

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:38.346
where will this end up, Gundogdu?

01:41:44.013 --> 01:41:45.980
I still feel the pain,
like burning cinder,

01:41:46.046 --> 01:41:48.180
of my babies who died
before birth, like Selcan.

01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:52.446
And there are the ones
you could not breastfeed.

01:41:55.313 --> 01:41:58.180
I couldn’t bear to bury one more baby.

01:42:00.713 --> 01:42:02.213
May god forgive my sins.

01:42:04.046 --> 01:42:06.280
I could not bear such a pain.

01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:15.713
So you say we will never hear
a baby’s voice in this tent, right?

01:42:21.446 --> 01:42:24.480
Do you want to bury me alive in this tent?
Is this what you want?

01:43:30.259 --> 01:43:31.259
Turali.

01:43:33.025 --> 01:43:34.825
Are you ready, son?
-I am, Bey.

01:43:35.325 --> 01:43:36.359
Come on.

01:43:39.359 --> 01:43:40.359
God, help us.

01:44:03.859 --> 01:44:04.859
What happened, Wild Demir?

01:44:06.925 --> 01:44:08.592
I brought food to Abdurrahman.

01:44:16.825 --> 01:44:18.492
Tugtekin Bey gave order.

01:44:18.959 --> 01:44:20.359
He will not see anyone.

01:44:20.959 --> 01:44:22.692
No one will go in.

01:44:23.592 --> 01:44:24.859
If someone goes out

01:44:26.259 --> 01:44:27.425
he will be killed.

01:44:29.559 --> 01:44:30.792
Why I shall not see him?

01:44:32.725 --> 01:44:35.725
Because he wishes so. Is it enough?

01:44:37.892 --> 01:44:39.625
That is all right.

01:44:41.825 --> 01:44:42.825
Go back!

01:44:44.259 --> 01:44:45.259
Guards!

01:44:47.025 --> 01:44:48.025
Come on!

01:44:49.459 --> 01:44:50.525
Leave now!

01:45:03.392 --> 01:45:04.392
Do not worry.

01:45:05.259 --> 01:45:07.859
I give your kind regards to dead one.

01:45:09.025 --> 01:45:10.025
Leave now!

01:45:10.759 --> 01:45:12.059
Do not cause trouble in the dead of night.

01:45:35.425 --> 01:45:37.359
All right. Okay.

01:46:23.992 --> 01:46:26.959
You saw your Beys betrayed you
for who you gave your life.

01:46:30.825 --> 01:46:32.792
Even Mother Hayme pays no mind to you.

01:46:37.525 --> 01:46:38.625
Ertugrul Bey...

01:46:41.559 --> 01:46:43.325
...does not come and ask how are you.

01:47:10.359 --> 01:47:12.559
You are still being a dog for your Beys.

01:47:17.992 --> 01:47:19.425
You will die here.

01:47:21.625 --> 01:47:24.625
If you confess the truth

01:47:27.025 --> 01:47:29.925
if you confess your coconspirators

01:47:31.425 --> 01:47:32.692
I can stop your execution.

01:47:34.759 --> 01:47:36.759
You will be exiled and have a good life.

01:47:38.392 --> 01:47:41.759
Who do you want to burn along
with me, Kocabash?

01:47:44.492 --> 01:47:45.625
I know your intention.

01:47:47.492 --> 01:47:48.492
Get out!

01:49:08.492 --> 01:49:10.692
Son, what are you doing here?

01:49:11.392 --> 01:49:13.359
I brought Ertugrul Bey's greetings.

01:49:21.392 --> 01:49:22.392
Be careful.

01:49:22.659 --> 01:49:24.592
Keep a sharp lookout around the tent.

01:52:17.692 --> 01:52:19.025
Control Dogan and Turgut.

01:52:26.525 --> 01:52:28.392
We could not bear any more trouble.

01:52:38.825 --> 01:52:39.892
And Abdurrahman...

01:52:42.392 --> 01:52:44.959
Please, do not do anything for him.

01:53:08.492 --> 01:53:10.325
-Fire!
-Run, fire!

01:53:10.559 --> 01:53:12.625
-Fire!
-Fire!

01:53:13.259 --> 01:53:15.625
-Tent is on fire!
-Come here! Fire!

01:53:16.325 --> 01:53:17.825
Go and report to Tugtekin Bey!

01:53:20.625 --> 01:53:21.959
Help, bring water!

01:53:23.392 --> 01:53:24.659
Fire, bring water!

01:53:26.259 --> 01:53:27.492
Hurry up!

01:53:29.525 --> 01:53:31.059
Fire! Bring water!

01:53:48.025 --> 01:53:49.259
<i>Always smile like this.</i>

01:53:49.825 --> 01:53:52.392
<i>When you are sad, I mumble.</i>

01:53:53.925 --> 01:53:55.025
<i>I do not know what to talk.</i>

01:53:55.692 --> 01:53:58.292
<i>-That bad?</i>
 <i>-You could not imagine.</i>

01:54:07.359 --> 01:54:08.359
<i>Bey?</i>

01:54:09.425 --> 01:54:10.425
Come in.

01:54:14.625 --> 01:54:16.425
-Bey, the tent is on fire.
-Which tent?

01:54:16.692 --> 01:54:17.792
Caged tent, Bey.

01:54:18.892 --> 01:54:19.892
Damn it!

01:54:29.259 --> 01:54:34.425
From now on, there is nothing we can do
about you and your Alps.

01:54:50.825 --> 01:54:53.859
I will do my best to keep
Abdurrahman alive, Ertugrul.

01:54:56.025 --> 01:54:57.825
I know, mother. I know.

01:54:58.892 --> 01:55:02.925
But Abdurrahman's life
is not entrusted to us.

01:55:05.025 --> 01:55:06.292
You already knew it.

01:55:36.725 --> 01:55:38.692
Fire! Bring water!

01:55:44.692 --> 01:55:45.859
Bring water!

01:55:53.559 --> 01:55:55.925
-Abdurrahman was not inside, Bey.
-What do you mean he was not inside?

01:56:08.625 --> 01:56:09.659
God damn it!

01:56:12.025 --> 01:56:14.292
God damn it! God damn it!

01:56:31.692 --> 01:56:32.825
Bring water!

01:56:37.892 --> 01:56:38.925
Water!

01:56:39.525 --> 01:56:40.792
Run! Run!

01:56:47.325 --> 01:56:48.325
Run! Water!

01:56:55.325 --> 01:56:56.992
When I get my grandchild to my lap

01:56:58.625 --> 01:57:00.292
I will sit on top of the world.

01:57:08.492 --> 01:57:10.559
I hope, but he could not be raised
by his parent.

01:57:21.892 --> 01:57:23.292
May god forbid.

01:57:36.459 --> 01:57:38.525
You vile! You let him escape, right?

01:57:41.259 --> 01:57:43.759
You are impertinent, Tugtekin!
Who escaped? What are you talking about?

01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:49.059
Caged tent burned!
Abdurrahman is not in it!

01:57:50.892 --> 01:57:52.025
Is that right, Ertugrul?

01:57:58.992 --> 01:58:02.425
I have no information about fire
and Abdurrahman, mother.

01:58:03.358 --> 01:58:05.625
Tugtekin and his Alps could not protect
what is entrusted to them.

01:58:08.259 --> 01:58:09.292
Lay down your sword.

01:58:17.692 --> 01:58:18.759
Lay down your sword!

01:58:45.992 --> 01:58:48.292
You are young! Really young!

01:58:53.525 --> 01:58:54.625
You crossed the line!

01:58:58.525 --> 01:58:59.559
Ertugrul, let him go.

01:59:00.559 --> 01:59:01.592
Ertugrul!

01:59:01.892 --> 01:59:02.992
Ertugrul, let him go!

01:59:03.359 --> 01:59:05.059
If you did something to him,
I will take your life!

01:59:19.359 --> 01:59:20.392
Let him go, you will kill him!

01:59:33.292 --> 01:59:34.292
Tugtekin!

01:59:38.659 --> 01:59:40.659
If you enter my marquee
like this once more

01:59:41.025 --> 01:59:42.359
I will kill you!

01:59:47.525 --> 01:59:48.592
And you, Ertugrul.

01:59:50.559 --> 01:59:52.492
I am not sure whether you did this or not.

01:59:53.692 --> 01:59:56.659
So, stay away from nomad tent for a while.

02:00:01.059 --> 02:00:02.425
Set out when sun rises.

02:00:08.592 --> 02:00:09.592
Mother!

02:00:11.525 --> 02:00:12.525
Tugtekin.

02:00:14.725 --> 02:00:16.292
Take your jackals and get out!

02:00:16.925 --> 02:00:17.925
Out!

02:01:30.259 --> 02:01:31.292
Do not worry.

02:01:31.825 --> 02:01:35.025
I will be with you and our baby
wherever I am.

02:01:37.259 --> 02:01:38.759
I know you want me to be patient.

02:01:41.292 --> 02:01:43.392
You want me to grin and bear it.

02:01:45.392 --> 02:01:46.592
I will do it, Ertugrul.

02:01:48.292 --> 02:01:52.025
From now on, your heart will be
my and my baby's bed.

02:02:50.025 --> 02:02:52.592
They are Ertugrul's Alps.
Turgut and Dogan.

02:02:54.259 --> 02:02:55.459
I met them in Kervansaray.

02:02:57.259 --> 02:03:00.892
<i>We draw our sword to be a martyr.</i>

02:03:10.525 --> 02:03:11.625
But where is Ertugrul?

02:03:13.525 --> 02:03:14.625
Shall I follow them, Noyan?

02:03:15.925 --> 02:03:17.325
I need you here.

02:03:19.925 --> 02:03:23.059
Tankut, send five men to follow them.

02:03:23.692 --> 02:03:24.859
Yes, Baycu Noyan.

02:04:31.592 --> 02:04:32.659
There is someone here!

02:04:57.892 --> 02:05:00.259
Who are you, insane man?
What are you doing here?

02:05:01.425 --> 02:05:02.792
Have you seen two Alps around?

02:06:55.925 --> 02:06:57.859
You are insane but skillful.

02:07:00.325 --> 02:07:05.625
I am not skillful but this stick
which run these infidels down.

02:07:41.759 --> 02:07:44.825
Accept it, Ertugrul and his Alps did it!

02:07:44.992 --> 02:07:46.025
Enough!

02:07:47.459 --> 02:07:48.459
Enough!

02:07:50.325 --> 02:07:51.692
Stop blaming my son.

02:07:54.659 --> 02:07:56.692
Your four Alps were guards at the tent.

02:07:57.759 --> 02:08:00.292
What were they doing
while the tent was burning?

02:08:01.292 --> 02:08:02.859
Abdurrahman did not fly from tent.

02:08:06.692 --> 02:08:08.025
My mother speaks truth, Tugtekin.

02:08:09.725 --> 02:08:12.392
Your Alps could not guard the tent.

02:08:13.292 --> 02:08:14.392
You could not protect him.

02:08:47.992 --> 02:08:49.892
At least, you fall into the
hands of me, Ertugrul.

02:09:01.025 --> 02:09:04.292
-What are you doing here, Gokce?
-I could not let you go.

02:09:05.725 --> 02:09:08.492
While there are enemies everywhere
what are you doing?

02:09:09.292 --> 02:09:10.859
So why are you going, Ertugrul?

02:09:11.925 --> 02:09:15.525
If there are Mongols everywhere,
where are you going with a wounded hand?

02:09:17.892 --> 02:09:19.359
Who is that beautiful girl?

02:09:20.625 --> 02:09:21.959
She is like Ertugrul's sister.

02:09:24.392 --> 02:09:25.792
Suleyman Shah killed their father

02:09:27.292 --> 02:09:28.959
and raised her sister and Gokce
as his own daughter.

02:09:31.025 --> 02:09:32.359
So, her name is Gokce.

02:09:36.659 --> 02:09:37.825
Go and prepare the horses.

02:09:56.292 --> 02:09:57.292
Gokce.

02:10:05.559 --> 02:10:06.559
Go!

02:10:07.892 --> 02:10:08.892
Go!
