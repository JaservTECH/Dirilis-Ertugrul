00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 39 will start after 11:52 min.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.713
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

11:57.876 --> 12:01.553
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:02.154 --> 12:05.153
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:10.675 --> 12:12.475
<i>Do we have permission, Gumustekin Bey?</i>

12:15.142 --> 12:16.409
Kaya, come in.

12:26.642 --> 12:28.842
Is there any news about Tugtekin Bey?

12:29.742 --> 12:30.909
There is not, Bey.

12:31.675 --> 12:35.175
We scoured the earth for him
and looked everywhere...

12:35.709 --> 12:38.875
...but could not find a trace
or his dead body.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.442
I wanted to inform our Bey.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.709
I shall inform our Bey.
You may leave, Kaya Alp.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.575
What will you tell me?

12:52.209 --> 12:55.375
Tell me, Kaya Alp.
Is there any news about my son?

12:57.642 --> 12:59.509
Bey, we did not find Tugtekin Bey.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.475
You could not find him
dead or alive, right?

13:16.375 --> 13:17.575
Tell me, Kaya Alp.

13:18.642 --> 13:19.842
Say it.

13:23.542 --> 13:26.742
Is it befitting for my Alps to make
black earth his eternal bed...

13:26.842 --> 13:30.175
...before he could marry his sweetheart?

13:36.842 --> 13:42.909
Why did you return while
the earth takes in his young body...

13:43.642 --> 13:45.809
...like rain water?

13:50.809 --> 13:55.809
Does it suit you to abandon
my son's dead body...

13:56.509 --> 14:00.575
...to the beaks of ravens
and to the teeth of hyenas?

14:00.742 --> 14:01.842
Bey.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.575
-Bey.
-Bey.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.275
Move here.

14:10.275 --> 14:12.642
Find him!

14:13.375 --> 14:15.175
It is alright, Kaya Alp, you may leave.

14:19.175 --> 14:21.175
Brother, where is he?

14:22.209 --> 14:24.575
I do not want to see
the Kayi tribe anymore.

14:48.475 --> 14:49.842
They must leave here.

14:51.109 --> 14:52.409
They must.

15:03.409 --> 15:05.175
After I recover from this damnation...

15:06.809 --> 15:08.809
...if I see them here...

15:11.209 --> 15:13.775
...I will kill them, all of them.

15:16.409 --> 15:19.509
I want all of them to get out of here.

15:29.775 --> 15:31.542
It is all my fault.

15:33.775 --> 15:36.409
If I did not tell Tugtekin
where Ertugrul was...

15:37.475 --> 15:38.675
...now...

15:40.209 --> 15:44.409
It is not your fault, Gokce.
You did the right thing.

15:45.409 --> 15:47.175
The judgment is on God's hands.

16:03.609 --> 16:09.309
-We want the killer of our Bey!
-We want justice!

16:10.909 --> 16:12.809
We want justice!

16:14.175 --> 16:15.509
We want justice!

16:18.242 --> 16:19.242
Mother!

16:20.742 --> 16:24.275
Dodurga Alps are coming here.

16:25.675 --> 16:27.675
They are all angry and
they have their swords.

16:31.409 --> 16:32.775
Mother.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.575
Korkut Bey is dying.

16:36.909 --> 16:38.642
He cannot endure this pain.

16:39.875 --> 16:44.209
Ertugrul did not only kill Tugtekin,
he killed Korkut Bey, too.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.442
We want justice!

16:52.475 --> 16:54.775
We want justice!

16:55.642 --> 16:57.209
Take your swords.

16:57.842 --> 17:00.109
If a need arises, defend yourself.
Quickly.

17:12.642 --> 17:14.675
We want justice!

17:18.875 --> 17:22.575
We want the killer of our Bey!
We want justice!

17:24.109 --> 17:28.442
-What is this uproar, brother?
-Some people must be restless.

17:30.142 --> 17:32.175
We want the killer of our Bey!

17:33.209 --> 17:35.175
Father. Aunt.

17:36.142 --> 17:39.342
Dodurga Alps are heading for
Mother Hayme's marquee.

17:39.409 --> 17:40.609
What?

17:40.709 --> 17:42.709
Is it those dogs' duty
to secure the justice?

17:42.775 --> 17:44.475
Father, what we will do?

17:45.609 --> 17:50.242
Gundogdu anticipated this and he
positioned Kayi Alps around the marquee.

17:51.675 --> 17:54.609
Blood will be shed, father.
Everything will be ruined.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.342
What shall we do, brother?
You cannot allow it.

18:01.775 --> 18:03.742
We want justice!

18:04.675 --> 18:06.542
Stop!

18:06.842 --> 18:08.642
My brothers, stop!

18:09.542 --> 18:11.842
My Alps! My brothers!

18:12.409 --> 18:15.375
Do not break our brotherhood
by violating our mores.

18:15.842 --> 18:18.342
It is time to rise up!

18:19.442 --> 18:20.875
Unless the betrayers die...

18:21.209 --> 18:23.275
...there is no peace for us in this tribe!

18:24.242 --> 18:27.842
Keep out of our way, Artuk!
Fine words butter no parsnips!

18:28.809 --> 18:32.642
It is time to punish! Move, Alps!

18:43.375 --> 18:45.575
We want justice!

18:46.709 --> 18:48.909
The dog which is soon to die.

18:50.742 --> 18:52.909
We want the killer of our Bey!

18:57.342 --> 19:00.842
We want justice!

19:27.175 --> 19:29.909
We want the killer of our Bey!

19:37.309 --> 19:39.509
We want the killer of our Bey!

19:41.909 --> 19:43.275
You shall answer for it!

19:43.509 --> 19:47.775
Mother Hayme, come here!
You shall answer for it, too.

19:50.409 --> 19:53.542
Mother. Please, have you gone mad?

19:54.742 --> 19:58.475
Mother. You shall not deal with
a few trifling Alps.

19:58.909 --> 20:00.609
I shall go there and talk to them.

20:01.242 --> 20:04.242
I have informed Alps,
they are all ready to combat.

20:07.509 --> 20:10.142
We want justice!

20:10.409 --> 20:12.742
Mother Hayme, come here.

20:14.342 --> 20:15.909
We want the killer of our Bey!

20:17.375 --> 20:18.542
Son.

20:19.775 --> 20:22.775
My children. Do you not hear that?

20:23.275 --> 20:25.342
They want my head.

20:26.875 --> 20:30.342
They hold me responsible for
their Bey's death...

20:30.509 --> 20:32.442
...as much as Ertugrul.

20:34.242 --> 20:37.209
No more blood shall be shed. Move aside.

20:37.442 --> 20:39.675
Mother. You cannot do such thing.

20:39.875 --> 20:42.375
We cannot know what this crowd would do.

20:45.142 --> 20:48.142
-We want justice!
-We want the killer of our Bey!

20:50.242 --> 20:51.775
We want justice!

20:51.909 --> 20:54.409
We want the killer of our Bey!

20:56.675 --> 20:59.609
If blood will be shed, it shall be mine.

21:01.442 --> 21:03.842
Not of any of my Alps. Move aside.

21:04.509 --> 21:06.309
-Mother.
-Gundogdu!

21:10.675 --> 21:13.575
-We want justice!
-We want the killer of our Bey!

21:24.375 --> 21:25.675
My God!

21:29.242 --> 21:30.475
My God!

21:32.175 --> 21:33.809
My God, what have I done?

21:40.209 --> 21:44.142
Will you make me pay for a betrayal...

21:46.375 --> 21:48.709
...or are you after a betrayal?

21:53.709 --> 21:55.509
Do you want justice?

21:56.675 --> 22:01.209
Or do you want brother's blood
to soothe your pain?

22:04.709 --> 22:07.275
How much blood will satisfy you?

22:09.342 --> 22:10.675
Tell me.

22:15.842 --> 22:19.142
It is obvious that you are
looking for Ertugrul...

22:20.175 --> 22:22.175
...you think he is the killer.

22:25.575 --> 22:31.442
If the blood of your Bey's mother
will satisfy you...

22:31.609 --> 22:37.409
...and if none of our Alp's
blood will be shed, I am here!

22:49.642 --> 22:51.575
My blood is halal for you.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.175
Mother!

23:12.209 --> 23:15.209
We came here to ask for justice.

23:16.609 --> 23:19.642
We are after the reprisal which
mores promised, Mother Hayme.

23:21.409 --> 23:24.375
Since one-armed Ertugrul came,
all kinds of calamity happened to us.

23:24.442 --> 23:26.542
How many of our man are
killed because of him?

23:26.609 --> 23:28.875
Kayi marquee has been
the home of betrayal.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.875
That is true!

23:31.609 --> 23:32.742
We want justice!

23:33.642 --> 23:35.475
We want justice!

23:35.809 --> 23:37.275
Treacherous dog!

23:37.709 --> 23:40.875
We want the killer of our Bey!

23:45.342 --> 23:47.509
We want justice!

23:50.242 --> 23:54.409
We want the killer of our Bey!

23:57.375 --> 23:59.309
That is enough! Enough!

24:01.509 --> 24:03.542
Enough! Stop!

24:05.842 --> 24:07.375
Pull yourselves together!

24:14.742 --> 24:17.175
Will you add more pain into our pain?

24:20.875 --> 24:23.575
Just because your Bey died
without a shroud...

24:23.742 --> 24:26.542
...will you make gallant men
accompany him with a shroud?

24:33.509 --> 24:38.575
How many will you kill from your brother
tribe to soothe your rage?

24:40.209 --> 24:42.742
One? Ten or 100?

24:46.475 --> 24:48.375
Will your hatred end then?

24:52.309 --> 24:56.275
What is this iniquitousness?
What kind of a mores is this?

25:07.209 --> 25:09.375
Tugtekin is my son.

25:11.175 --> 25:14.775
He is the son of my Bey
who struggles in pain in his marquee.

25:15.809 --> 25:17.509
I know well...

25:19.142 --> 25:26.142
...that we and Tugtekin's brave Alps
will not turn his blood adrift.

25:35.842 --> 25:40.809
But how can you justify
revolting against your Beys...

25:40.875 --> 25:43.609
...without knowing anything or questioning?

25:49.809 --> 25:52.909
Know your place or you will not
be any different...

25:53.275 --> 25:56.442
...than the killer of Tugtekin
in our eyes.

27:11.609 --> 27:13.542
Where is Ertugrul Bey?

27:33.542 --> 27:34.875
I said, where is he?

27:42.409 --> 27:46.275
He has gone to the tribe, Halime Sultan.
We could not stop him.

27:53.309 --> 27:55.409
How did you leave him alone?

28:35.375 --> 28:40.209
Halime, my girl, Ertugrul Bey
will do what is necessary.

28:42.675 --> 28:46.575
Wild Demir, they are going to
execute him. Do you not know?

28:49.175 --> 28:51.109
They would not let him live there.

28:54.542 --> 28:56.209
That is a war, too, daughter.

28:57.575 --> 29:02.542
Sometimes a man rides against
the army coming onto his horse...

29:02.775 --> 29:05.575
...even if he is alone,
even if he is wounded.

29:07.875 --> 29:11.342
Ertugrul Bey will do his duty.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.109
We will, too.

29:14.375 --> 29:17.675
He shall go to the tribe
and defend justice.

29:18.342 --> 29:20.675
And we shall go to Konya.

29:21.309 --> 29:24.609
We are going to bring about
the bequest of Ertokus.

29:30.642 --> 29:32.675
You wanted to go to this war.

29:35.709 --> 29:37.209
There is no turning back now.

29:38.542 --> 29:41.742
If God permits, either victory
or martyrdom.

29:43.609 --> 29:44.675
Come on now.

29:47.109 --> 29:50.375
Pull yourself together.
We have a long road to Konya.

30:17.175 --> 30:20.309
All shall put their sword down
and head for their tent.

30:24.109 --> 30:25.375
I said put them down!

30:33.875 --> 30:36.709
This is a headquarters' matter.

30:37.809 --> 30:39.309
Go back!

30:41.875 --> 30:43.475
These are empty words.

30:44.675 --> 30:46.609
We want to take revenge of our Bey.

30:47.509 --> 30:49.642
The doings of these traitors is enough.

31:23.509 --> 31:25.642
Traitor!

31:25.809 --> 31:27.142
Ertugrul.

31:32.842 --> 31:35.642
-Traitor!
-The killer came.

31:36.542 --> 31:39.642
-Traitor!
-The killer!

31:45.109 --> 31:47.509
-Traitor!
-The killer!

31:54.209 --> 31:56.375
Traitor!

31:57.309 --> 32:00.575
Killer!

32:33.609 --> 32:35.242
Killer!

33:10.409 --> 33:12.475
Hell for all traitors!

33:17.742 --> 33:20.175
Hell for all traitors!

33:20.309 --> 33:22.542
Hell for all traitors!

33:23.109 --> 33:25.542
Hell for all traitors!

33:25.775 --> 33:30.509
Hell for all traitors!

33:31.475 --> 33:34.842
Hell for all traitors!

33:35.209 --> 33:36.509
Ertugrul!

33:41.742 --> 33:43.342
You are a tyrant!

33:45.509 --> 33:47.375
First, you killed my son...

33:48.375 --> 33:49.775
...now my Alp.

33:50.642 --> 33:52.275
Damn you!

34:33.342 --> 34:34.475
Mother!

34:43.142 --> 34:44.542
Mother.

34:47.575 --> 34:48.775
Mother.

34:53.609 --> 34:55.575
-Take your positions!
-Mother!

34:56.542 --> 34:57.909
-Mother.
-Mother.

34:58.542 --> 35:01.509
-Take your positions!
-Mother!

35:05.875 --> 35:07.775
Everyone, tread lightly!

35:20.775 --> 35:22.275
Put your swords down!

35:24.775 --> 35:26.775
Unsheathe your swords!

35:27.642 --> 35:31.475
Korkut!
If something happens to my mother...

35:31.742 --> 35:34.375
...you must know that I will pay you back.

35:54.342 --> 35:55.675
Slowly, Bey.

35:59.342 --> 36:00.342
Mother!

36:00.742 --> 36:02.742
In God's name.

36:04.775 --> 36:05.842
Mother!

36:18.675 --> 36:19.809
Mother.

36:23.675 --> 36:25.542
You came to your tribe.

36:30.142 --> 36:33.575
I saw you before I die.

36:34.742 --> 36:36.409
Thank God.

36:39.675 --> 36:42.775
I am here, mother. Do not worry about it.

36:46.542 --> 36:48.575
I will not leave you alone after this.

36:51.575 --> 36:53.309
Forgive me.

36:56.209 --> 36:57.809
Forgive me.

37:04.575 --> 37:05.809
Mother.

37:10.342 --> 37:12.442
Mother.

37:13.409 --> 37:14.775
Mother.

37:16.808 --> 37:19.308
-Mother.
-Mother, do not leave us alone.

37:22.475 --> 37:25.342
Beys, allow me. Selcan Hatun, help me.

37:25.842 --> 37:29.675
Bey, please. Ertugrul Bey, please, move.

37:30.808 --> 37:34.609
My God, help us, please.
My God, pity on us.

37:36.509 --> 37:39.509
My God, bless her to us.
My God pity on us.

37:39.609 --> 37:41.209
Daughter Gokce, bring hot water.

37:43.709 --> 37:45.175
Slowly.

37:49.109 --> 37:50.375
Open it.

38:01.709 --> 38:06.142
God, what have I done? What have I done?

38:09.142 --> 38:11.142
I killed my sister.

38:11.642 --> 38:14.642
Settle down, Bey.
While there is life, there is hope.

38:15.109 --> 38:16.542
Do not lose hope immediately.

38:17.509 --> 38:20.375
What happened? Could they not find my son?

38:22.309 --> 38:26.142
Send more Alps.
They will leave no stone unturned.

38:26.242 --> 38:29.409
Do not worry about it, Korkut Bey.
We are looking for Tugtekin everywhere.

38:29.709 --> 38:32.675
I sent off 50 Alps to northern side.

38:33.675 --> 38:36.542
We had finalized all preparations
to look for him at night.

38:37.242 --> 38:40.742
It is all Ertugrul's fault.
He could not find peace.

38:41.175 --> 38:43.842
I did not cherish my son
as much as I cherished him.

38:44.642 --> 38:47.509
He killed our best Alp
in front of our eyes.

38:48.175 --> 38:49.575
I shall kill him.

38:51.675 --> 38:52.675
Bey.

39:01.742 --> 39:03.575
You need to keep calm, Bey.

39:04.709 --> 39:06.842
First, we need to find out
if Hayme is alive.

39:07.309 --> 39:09.409
Otherwise everything will fall.

39:09.842 --> 39:11.909
The arrow has left the bow.

39:12.309 --> 39:16.342
Either we take Ertugrul in or
blood will be shed in streams.

39:19.375 --> 39:22.275
Bey?

39:28.442 --> 39:29.875
Bey.

39:56.109 --> 40:01.142
Halime Sultan, do not worry about him.
Ertugrul Bey surely knows something.

40:02.242 --> 40:03.675
Patience.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.409
Do not worry.

40:08.909 --> 40:12.442
We are going to go to take
Ertugrul Bey's custodial with the Alps.

40:15.475 --> 40:16.642
What custodial?

40:17.609 --> 40:20.709
Brother, we had many troubles
because of this custodial.

40:20.809 --> 40:22.909
Someone shall tell me what is in this.

40:24.142 --> 40:26.709
Do not worry, you will see
the custodial, too.

40:38.742 --> 40:40.642
We shall take the road.

40:51.242 --> 40:52.642
What will we do, my sheikh?

40:53.309 --> 40:55.609
You will go to Konya right away.

40:56.342 --> 40:57.575
Be quick.

41:54.309 --> 41:56.642
Did you feel the smell of
Ertugrul's carrion?

41:57.442 --> 41:59.775
I have brought you
Sadettin Kobek's greeting.

42:01.242 --> 42:02.542
Does he want gold again?

42:03.509 --> 42:06.242
Whenever he sends a greeting,
I pay ten thousand gold coins.

42:06.309 --> 42:07.842
What kind of a greed is this?

42:08.809 --> 42:10.275
Do not forget, Noyan.

42:10.442 --> 42:13.342
If it were not for us,
you could have not even come to Erzurum.

42:17.242 --> 42:20.542
-What does he want again?
-Nothing.

42:22.342 --> 42:24.475
Ertugrul returned to tribe.

42:25.109 --> 42:27.509
We found out that he killed Kocabash.

42:27.875 --> 42:31.309
-We are going to make him answer for it.
-That is good.

42:40.242 --> 42:42.842
We delivered you the wolf puppy in a cage.

42:44.442 --> 42:46.742
If you cannot succeed this time...

42:47.509 --> 42:52.809
...I will make you and your Sadettin Kobek
pay for it. You shall know it.

42:54.209 --> 42:59.842
Kobek never forgets the kindness
and misdeed done to him.

43:00.309 --> 43:01.642
We will see.

43:03.175 --> 43:04.509
We will see.

43:23.442 --> 43:25.442
Kocabash.

43:27.175 --> 43:29.109
My faithful dog.

43:30.642 --> 43:33.509
So Ertugrul cut off your head.

43:36.275 --> 43:38.242
My miserable dog.

43:42.709 --> 43:45.442
Ulubilge, play.

43:46.909 --> 43:51.342
Play so that our souls shall be washed
with the soul of mountains.

43:51.775 --> 43:56.142
Play until the moon sees our light
and the sky shines.

44:39.709 --> 44:41.309
Alps of Ertugrul.

44:42.909 --> 44:45.709
When I see you always on duty like this...

44:45.909 --> 44:49.775
...I remember Tariq Ibn Ziyad
who burned the ships.

44:50.909 --> 44:53.842
-Do you know his story?
-We do.

44:56.275 --> 44:57.909
If I say we do, it would be a lie.

44:58.209 --> 44:59.842
If I say that we do not,
it would be a shame.

45:00.475 --> 45:04.609
We heard of his name.
And that is all we know, my sheikh.

45:06.442 --> 45:10.709
Tariq Ibn Ziyad. He was a lion-hearted,
valiant man of Islam.

45:11.775 --> 45:14.709
He was the conqueror of Andalusia,
I was born there.

45:15.842 --> 45:21.175
There were many brave men who conquered
the states and hometowns in history.

45:21.709 --> 45:25.909
But his place is different.

45:27.875 --> 45:32.809
The blue waters of Mediterranean did not
realize that a new epic will be written...

45:32.909 --> 45:38.175
...when he took the road
to bring justice to Andalusia.

45:39.175 --> 45:42.342
When he arrived the coast
of Andalusia with his troops...

45:42.575 --> 45:44.809
...he confronted his troops.

45:46.142 --> 45:50.575
He shouted out to them. Andalusia
would start a new golden age...

45:50.709 --> 45:53.142
...under the favor of his speech.

45:53.909 --> 45:59.609
What did this great warrior
say to bring this new age?

46:01.875 --> 46:06.375
Soldiers who saw a lot of enemies
in front of them...

46:07.242 --> 46:09.809
...wanted to turn back.

46:10.675 --> 46:14.275
Then the great commander
burned down the ships.

46:16.509 --> 46:20.675
The waters of Mediterranean
warmed with the fire of his ships.

46:22.309 --> 46:26.342
They had no means to return
to their hometown.

46:27.675 --> 46:31.275
So either Andalusia would be conquered
or all of them would become martyrs.

46:31.675 --> 46:35.209
And the great commander
said to his troops...

46:36.409 --> 46:41.309
..."the sea like an enemy is behind
and the enemy like the sea is before you.

46:41.542 --> 46:43.309
Where can you run away?

46:44.242 --> 46:47.709
You have no choice but to be
loyal and patient.

46:48.375 --> 46:51.709
Either your swords will bring the enemy,
as vast as the sea, to their knees...

46:52.342 --> 46:55.342
...or the sea will fill with your blood."

46:58.142 --> 47:00.842
How brave he is.

47:03.375 --> 47:04.575
Thank you.

47:07.142 --> 47:10.175
If you burn the ships
for the sake of your cause...

47:10.909 --> 47:14.775
...you will conquer Andalusia
and create the golden age.

47:16.275 --> 47:18.475
If God permits, we will see those days.

47:19.109 --> 47:23.342
These lands will live the spring
like Andalusia.

47:24.642 --> 47:30.775
If you can manage to burn the ships,
these lands will live many golden ages.

47:31.109 --> 47:32.642
If God permits.

47:53.976 --> 47:59.210
My God, restore her health
for the sake of your name, Healer.

47:59.298 --> 48:01.464
In God's name.

49:09.531 --> 49:12.531
Ertugrul, what have you done?
What have you done?

49:12.898 --> 49:18.264
While we are trying to save you from
the blame of Tugtekin's murder...

49:18.831 --> 49:22.398
...how could you kill Kocabash
for all the world to see?

49:26.131 --> 49:28.131
I did what was necessary, brother.

49:29.898 --> 49:33.131
Shut up for God's sake, Ertugrul.

49:33.564 --> 49:36.498
My mother is fighting for her life
because of you.

49:39.498 --> 49:44.498
No, brother. I will not take your side
anymore. Go your own way.

49:46.298 --> 49:49.531
How could you kill Kocabash
for all the world to see?

49:50.698 --> 49:52.431
Brother, he was a betrayer.

49:53.631 --> 49:56.698
If I did not kill him, peace could not be
sustained in the tribe.

49:57.764 --> 50:00.098
Do we have peace in the tribe now?

50:00.231 --> 50:01.364
Do we?

50:01.431 --> 50:02.831
Look at my mother.

50:03.831 --> 50:05.631
There will be a bloodbath.

50:10.364 --> 50:12.598
We have not found
Tugtekin’s body yet.

50:17.598 --> 50:19.131
Tugtekin is alive, brother.

50:24.398 --> 50:25.398
Is he alive?

50:28.664 --> 50:29.798
Where is he?

50:30.898 --> 50:32.364
He is in safe hands.

51:11.098 --> 51:12.264
God!

51:13.164 --> 51:14.531
Was he not dead, brothers?

51:18.331 --> 51:19.498
Thank you, God.

51:21.898 --> 51:24.864
I never thought I would be so happy
to see this tactless person alive.

51:29.231 --> 51:30.698
Neither did I, brother.

51:33.264 --> 51:34.798
Dervish, how is he?

51:35.231 --> 51:38.298
My sheikh, we should carry him
somewhere safer.

51:45.398 --> 51:48.398
Efendi, how did you find him?

52:05.131 --> 52:06.231
Tugtekin.

52:14.598 --> 52:15.831
Tugtekin.

52:16.798 --> 52:18.131
Tugtekin.

52:22.698 --> 52:25.231
Thank God, your heart says
that you are still alive.

52:29.264 --> 52:30.531
Hang on, brother.

52:33.798 --> 52:38.264
When Khidr is your companion, son,
fortune is always on your side.

52:59.364 --> 53:02.231
For the sake of your name, Healer.

53:05.431 --> 53:10.498
For the sake of the miracles
you bestowed upon Prophet Jesus.

53:14.731 --> 53:16.664
Bestow them upon this gallant man.

53:19.764 --> 53:21.431
Revive him.

53:38.164 --> 53:39.164
Tugtekin.

53:41.131 --> 53:42.698
<i>Alhamdulillah.</i>

53:47.531 --> 53:49.231
We should hide him somewhere.

54:00.898 --> 54:03.664
Alps, we should carry him right away.

54:04.864 --> 54:08.864
Ertugrul Bey's salvation depends on
this young man's survival.

54:09.298 --> 54:10.298
Hurry.

54:20.098 --> 54:24.598
Then we must help Tugtekin heal and
bring him to the tribe immediately.

54:25.598 --> 54:27.398
If God permits, he will get better.

54:34.164 --> 54:35.631
What will we do if he does not?

54:36.498 --> 54:38.664
We should wait until our mother recovers.

54:41.898 --> 54:43.164
Brother.

54:44.698 --> 54:48.398
Our uncle does not want
the two tribes to stay together anymore.

54:49.464 --> 54:51.364
Always be on guard.

55:15.364 --> 55:18.231
I showed mercy to Ertugrul.

55:20.698 --> 55:22.498
I believed in him.

55:24.264 --> 55:25.331
I trusted him.

55:27.898 --> 55:30.164
I valued him more than my son.

55:32.164 --> 55:33.498
But what did he do?

55:35.698 --> 55:37.198
He killed my son.

55:39.631 --> 55:45.131
He killed Kocabash,
who I trained with my own hands.

55:47.098 --> 55:49.331
This is not your fault, Bey.

55:50.731 --> 55:52.098
It makes no difference.

55:54.364 --> 55:55.698
It is over now.

55:57.564 --> 55:59.131
Everything is over.

56:00.731 --> 56:03.764
Korkut Bey, if you give in...

56:03.898 --> 56:06.364
...a fight between the two tribes
will be inevitable.

56:06.631 --> 56:09.864
We shall stand upright and
solve this matter with our minds.

56:12.498 --> 56:17.531
I do not want any more bloodshed
until Ertugrul is punished...

56:18.864 --> 56:22.598
...and the Kayis leave my tribe.

56:26.864 --> 56:28.898
There is only one person’s
blood to be shed.

56:29.731 --> 56:33.598
And that is Ertugrul's blood,
after the council meeting.

56:35.098 --> 56:36.098
Go...

56:36.698 --> 56:38.631
...and stop the fight
between the two tribes.

56:39.398 --> 56:41.098
Talk to Gundogdu.

56:43.531 --> 56:45.898
They will leave my tribe...

56:47.498 --> 56:49.598
...after the council meeting, tomorrow.

56:52.664 --> 56:55.364
Sow the wind and reap the whirlwind.

56:55.731 --> 56:57.498
You shall be calm first.

56:58.464 --> 57:02.398
After all, nothing will be concluded
before you give the final word.

57:05.898 --> 57:07.598
What did I do to my sister...

57:10.331 --> 57:11.764
...with my own hands?

57:16.331 --> 57:18.098
If she dies...

57:18.798 --> 57:20.898
...how will I live with this sin?

57:23.598 --> 57:27.698
Do not worry, Bey.
I will take care of Hayme myself.

57:31.198 --> 57:32.698
You need to rest.

58:06.764 --> 58:10.631
You try to calm Kayis down
and I will soothe our Alps' rage.

58:11.298 --> 58:13.498
If we cannot compose both tribes...

58:13.731 --> 58:15.898
...your margrave position
will only be a dream, brother.

58:19.698 --> 58:23.164
If we cannot solve this matter, Aytolun...

58:23.631 --> 58:26.864
...we should not become Beys,
nor hold our swords.

58:37.231 --> 58:39.098
Give us Ertugrul.

58:44.731 --> 58:46.564
We want justice!

58:49.831 --> 58:52.631
Give us Ertugrul!

58:55.598 --> 58:57.598
Give us the killer.

59:00.264 --> 59:03.164
We want justice!

59:14.698 --> 59:18.798
They swarm like flies that wade in dirt.

59:22.264 --> 59:24.564
Go and wade in the dirt
in your marquee.

59:24.664 --> 59:29.331
Sister! Neither Aytolun Hatun
nor Korkut Bey...

59:29.764 --> 59:32.831
...or Tugtekin are involved
in any of these things.

59:35.164 --> 59:36.398
It was an accident.

59:36.564 --> 59:38.264
If you do not believe that...

59:38.398 --> 59:40.264
...how can we make
the two tribes believe it?

59:41.264 --> 59:44.531
Do you want rivers of blood to flow
from the two tribes' Alps?

59:45.764 --> 59:47.631
Do not fan the flame.

59:49.131 --> 59:50.898
Sister, you changed sides quickly.

59:51.131 --> 59:53.664
While the woman who raised you
is on the brink of death...

59:53.764 --> 59:57.731
...you stand before me and defend
that whore and her husband.

00:59:58.698 --> 01:00:02.331
You do not know what you are saying.
Your hatred makes you blind.

01:00:03.131 --> 01:00:04.264
Gokce!

01:00:05.464 --> 01:00:09.798
If you did not inform Tugtekin
of where Ertugrul was...

01:00:10.098 --> 01:00:11.831
...none of this would have happened.

01:00:13.164 --> 01:00:14.398
Now, shut up!

01:00:17.431 --> 01:00:18.598
Is that true?

01:00:22.098 --> 01:00:27.498
Did you eavesdrop and
tip that sweetheart of yours?

01:00:29.864 --> 01:00:31.698
I just wanted justice to be served.

01:00:32.631 --> 01:00:35.831
I wanted Ertugrul Bey to come
out of the council meeting honourably...

01:00:36.098 --> 01:00:37.431
...and prove his innocence.

01:00:37.864 --> 01:00:41.631
My only aim was to stop the two tribes
from falling out with each other.

01:00:45.231 --> 01:00:47.798
Gokce, the two tribes are
falling out with each other now!

01:00:49.498 --> 01:00:50.731
You ruined it all.

01:00:56.131 --> 01:00:57.564
Do you think so, Ertugrul Bey?

01:00:59.298 --> 01:01:01.698
Your wife has caused us
a lot of trouble.

01:01:02.798 --> 01:01:04.598
Many of our Alps were martyred.

01:01:05.698 --> 01:01:08.364
We have had many troubles
because of your wife.

01:01:09.331 --> 01:01:10.864
What are you talking about?

01:01:15.898 --> 01:01:20.831
You are as foolish as Tugtekin.
You found each other well!

01:01:22.564 --> 01:01:27.598
Is there any justice left in all this
filth to be given to Ertugrul Bey?

01:01:36.398 --> 01:01:38.164
Artuk Bey, how is my mother?

01:01:39.331 --> 01:01:41.231
Let us pray for her to live.

01:01:43.431 --> 01:01:45.731
But be ready for everything.

01:01:58.698 --> 01:02:00.464
Know your place, Gokce!

01:02:00.598 --> 01:02:03.398
I will kill you even
though you are my sister!

01:02:10.598 --> 01:02:12.664
We want the killer.

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:16.331
We want justice.

01:02:18.364 --> 01:02:21.798
Give us Ertugrul.

01:02:25.664 --> 01:02:28.431
We want justice.

01:02:31.264 --> 01:02:32.798
We want justice.

01:02:41.598 --> 01:02:43.498
Give us Ertugrul.

01:02:51.498 --> 01:02:53.197
Inform them that I am here.

01:02:53.598 --> 01:02:55.298
I wish to see Mother Hayme.

01:02:57.498 --> 01:03:00.331
We want justice. Give him to us.

01:03:05.631 --> 01:03:08.831
Aytolun Hatun is here.
She wishes to see Mother Hayme.

01:03:09.831 --> 01:03:11.398
I will talk to her.

01:03:18.464 --> 01:03:20.831
We want justice.

01:03:33.531 --> 01:03:35.431
We want justice.

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:57.164
Do you finally have what you wanted?

01:03:59.364 --> 01:04:04.131
We shall not bring more trouble when there
is already so many, Selcan Hatun.

01:04:04.898 --> 01:04:07.731
I worry about Mother Hayme.
I wish to see her.

01:04:09.431 --> 01:04:13.131
If I do not want you to,
you cannot see my mother.

01:04:13.698 --> 01:04:15.298
What is your problem?

01:04:16.298 --> 01:04:18.264
Who do you think you are?

01:04:19.764 --> 01:04:21.164
I am...

01:04:23.631 --> 01:04:25.664
I am the daughter of Suleyman Shah.

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:31.098
What about you, Aytolun? Which
barrel bottom did they scrape you from?

01:04:32.598 --> 01:04:34.664
Watch your mouth, Selcan!

01:04:34.764 --> 01:04:37.698
Do not say anything
you might regret later.

01:04:38.231 --> 01:04:40.364
All your games are finished,
are they not?

01:04:42.264 --> 01:04:44.664
Many things you did not expect
have happened.

01:04:44.731 --> 01:04:46.564
And you stand aghast.

01:04:46.698 --> 01:04:49.864
Now, you are thinking
of how to solve it, right?

01:04:50.431 --> 01:04:53.898
But that does not cut any slack with me.

01:04:54.431 --> 01:04:56.498
You do not know what you are saying.

01:04:57.898 --> 01:05:01.564
But allow me to say that
you are a well-versed woman.

01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:04.698
You trained her well.

01:05:05.631 --> 01:05:09.531
Since she cut herself free from her leash
and tipped Ertugrul to you!

01:05:10.798 --> 01:05:12.364
Sister, what are you saying?

01:05:13.331 --> 01:05:14.864
Shut up!

01:05:17.131 --> 01:05:21.331
Aytolun, I know more than you think.

01:05:22.098 --> 01:05:25.364
I know that you ordered
the murder of that old woman.

01:05:25.864 --> 01:05:28.498
That you got into my uncle's bed
like a serpent...

01:05:28.664 --> 01:05:31.331
...even before my aunt, Duru, died.

01:05:31.398 --> 01:05:33.231
-That is enough!
-It is not!

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:38.698
There is more, yet I am waiting
for the right time.

01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:44.698
One of us, you or me...

01:05:45.164 --> 01:05:48.331
...will leave this tribe
before the winter ends.

01:05:48.864 --> 01:05:51.231
Then you should be careful, Hatun.

01:05:53.198 --> 01:05:56.131
Your soul may leave your body
while you are leaving, too.

01:06:23.598 --> 01:06:25.631
Why did you come back to the tribe, Bey?

01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:31.698
Why did you put your life in danger?

01:06:32.398 --> 01:06:35.431
If my life were more important
than our cause...

01:06:35.798 --> 01:06:38.264
...none of this would have happened,
Artuk Bey.

01:06:38.731 --> 01:06:41.398
We would have either
fallen prey to wolves or ravens...

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:43.564
...or become an appetizer
on a tyrant's table.

01:06:44.298 --> 01:06:46.731
Bey, we know that you are innocent.

01:06:47.664 --> 01:06:50.864
But how will all these angry people know?

01:06:51.731 --> 01:06:56.331
There was one person who could testify
to your innocence but...

01:06:56.464 --> 01:06:59.664
I came here so the two tribes
would not fall out with each other.

01:07:00.464 --> 01:07:01.864
And about Tugtekin...

01:07:03.464 --> 01:07:04.898
...my Alps are with him.

01:07:08.531 --> 01:07:11.298
He is fighting for his life
in Geyikli's cave.

01:07:12.498 --> 01:07:15.831
Ibn Arabi is taking care of him,
as well as Geyikli.

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:19.598
But Tugtekin needs you.

01:07:21.764 --> 01:07:23.898
To tell the truth,
you came just in time, Bey.

01:07:26.164 --> 01:07:28.864
We shall bring Tugtekin to the tribe
as soon as possible.

01:07:29.164 --> 01:07:32.431
In order to make the Dodurga tribe
believe in your innocence,

01:07:33.364 --> 01:07:35.464
Tugtekin shall not come to the tribe...

01:07:35.631 --> 01:07:38.431
...before he recovers and tells about
Kocabash's betrayal.

01:07:38.531 --> 01:07:42.498
I do not know how far the arms
of betrayal reach in the tribe.

01:07:44.564 --> 01:07:48.464
That is why, Artuk Bey,
if my mother is alright...

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:50.898
...you should go to Tugtekin right away.

01:07:52.131 --> 01:07:57.098
I did what I could do, Bey.
The rest is the will of God.

01:07:59.598 --> 01:08:01.231
The whole incident is here.

01:08:01.331 --> 01:08:04.831
But you need to extend the time until
the council meeting, as much as you can.

01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:07.531
So I can do all I can.

01:08:08.364 --> 01:08:10.331
May God help you, Bey.

01:08:10.798 --> 01:08:13.231
We will live by our fate.

01:08:13.764 --> 01:08:15.864
Neither more nor less.

01:08:17.098 --> 01:08:21.464
But the fire of instigation
in the tribe must die out.

01:08:23.531 --> 01:08:24.831
Thank you, Bey.

01:09:40.764 --> 01:09:41.898
Talk.

01:09:43.198 --> 01:09:46.898
Halime Sultan and Wild Demir,
mentors of Ertugrul...

01:09:47.298 --> 01:09:49.131
...set off to Konya.

01:09:53.364 --> 01:09:54.831
How did you learn this?

01:10:07.731 --> 01:10:09.664
Tangut, what are you hiding from me?

01:10:09.798 --> 01:10:11.798
One of our warriors who spies on
the tribe said that...

01:10:11.864 --> 01:10:13.864
...he saw them leaving together.

01:10:14.098 --> 01:10:16.198
How do you know that
they are going to Konya?

01:10:16.264 --> 01:10:18.864
From the intelligence information
of Ertokus we were after.

01:10:22.664 --> 01:10:26.164
-The ones Sungurtekin sent?
-Yes.

01:10:27.698 --> 01:10:30.598
Ertugrul has them. I can feel it.

01:10:31.564 --> 01:10:35.631
He will send him and
his wife to Sultan Aleaddin.

01:10:38.164 --> 01:10:39.698
Go after them, right away.

01:10:41.331 --> 01:10:43.231
The ones Sungurtekin sent.

01:10:44.664 --> 01:10:46.831
If my predictions are true...

01:10:48.231 --> 01:10:51.198
...all the information about
the Mongol army should be there.

01:10:54.298 --> 01:10:56.564
Aleaddin should not read those papers.

01:10:58.764 --> 01:11:00.631
First obtain the paper...

01:11:01.764 --> 01:11:03.598
...then kill them both.

01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:09.798
Wait!

01:11:12.231 --> 01:11:17.164
Tell Shaman to prepare my most
valuable, most brave warriors...

01:11:17.264 --> 01:11:19.764
...who are eager to die tonight.

01:11:21.231 --> 01:11:23.331
I will keep my promise to Ertugrul.

01:11:25.298 --> 01:11:26.564
Before his life...

01:11:27.698 --> 01:11:30.564
...I will take everything in his heart,
everything he values...

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:34.898
...what he treasures most...

01:11:36.198 --> 01:11:38.631
...his tribe, his honour...

01:11:40.698 --> 01:11:42.264
...from his hands.

01:11:51.164 --> 01:11:52.431
You heard Noyan.

01:11:52.564 --> 01:11:55.598
Make all the preparations;
prepare all the men.

01:13:31.531 --> 01:13:32.698
Artuk Bey.

01:13:34.364 --> 01:13:36.231
They said you were leaving.

01:13:37.564 --> 01:13:40.464
Where are you going when
the tribe is in such a condition?

01:13:42.731 --> 01:13:46.364
I take care of the Beys of
both tribes, Aytolun Hatun.

01:13:46.898 --> 01:13:48.498
My duty is hard.

01:13:49.698 --> 01:13:53.864
I must look for God's cure in herbs
for their treatment.

01:14:01.531 --> 01:14:02.898
That restorative...

01:14:03.831 --> 01:14:05.798
Does our Bey still take it?

01:14:08.798 --> 01:14:10.631
He does not.

01:14:12.664 --> 01:14:17.464
We risked being without a child
so our Bey could live, Artuk Bey.

01:14:20.198 --> 01:14:22.831
Thank you, Aytolun Hatun.

01:14:24.564 --> 01:14:26.764
Living in a marquee comes with a price.

01:14:27.231 --> 01:14:30.731
When the time comes,
that price shall be paid.

01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:35.864
That is what we are paying, Artuk Bey.

01:14:37.264 --> 01:14:38.831
Even though our bed is cold...

01:14:38.898 --> 01:14:43.498
...our hearts can pay this price
so that our tribe's unity and amity...

01:14:44.498 --> 01:14:47.398
...can always be strong.

01:14:50.231 --> 01:14:56.831
Thank God we have astute Hatuns
and Beys like you in our tribe!

01:14:59.498 --> 01:15:00.698
Thank you.

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:05.298
May God keep your path bright.

01:15:45.264 --> 01:15:46.598
The water is ready, my sheikh.

01:15:57.864 --> 01:16:00.364
Geyikli of Bayirbucak Turkmens.

01:16:01.264 --> 01:16:03.764
Your shelter changed the fate of people.

01:16:04.631 --> 01:16:07.498
You are brave like all
Bayirbucak Turkmens.

01:16:07.731 --> 01:16:10.831
You are courageous.
May God bless you in both worlds.

01:16:11.498 --> 01:16:13.464
May He render your fight everlasting.

01:16:14.231 --> 01:16:16.764
Amen.

01:16:18.664 --> 01:16:21.331
-May God bless you, my sheikh.
-Thank you.

01:16:22.364 --> 01:16:23.731
In God's name.

01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:45.198
In God's name.

01:17:22.864 --> 01:17:23.864
Mother.

01:17:25.464 --> 01:17:26.531
Mother.

01:17:29.198 --> 01:17:30.298
Mother.

01:17:32.664 --> 01:17:33.731
Mother.

01:17:43.798 --> 01:17:45.264
My children.

01:17:47.298 --> 01:17:48.498
My dears.

01:18:08.398 --> 01:18:09.631
Always...

01:18:11.598 --> 01:18:13.431
...be together.

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:24.231
Take care of Ertugrul...

01:18:26.364 --> 01:18:28.564
...and the tribe.

01:18:41.364 --> 01:18:44.864
The seigniory is yours, son.

01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:02.731
Mother.

01:19:16.464 --> 01:19:18.164
That knife had to pierce me.

01:19:19.398 --> 01:19:20.698
It had to go into my flesh.

01:19:22.231 --> 01:19:24.331
No, brother. Rest assured.

01:19:25.498 --> 01:19:27.531
None of us are guilty in this matter.

01:19:33.664 --> 01:19:35.198
As my mother said...

01:19:35.864 --> 01:19:39.464
...you shall be Bey, brother.
There is no time to lose.

01:19:40.564 --> 01:19:43.297
Demand a council meeting
and take the seigniory.

01:19:43.731 --> 01:19:45.731
I will stand behind you until I die.

01:19:45.898 --> 01:19:49.164
With God's help.
I have no doubt of it, brother.

01:19:50.864 --> 01:19:52.864
My mother knows what I think.

01:19:54.564 --> 01:19:57.364
You are right. My mother is right, too.

01:19:57.564 --> 01:20:01.098
It is time to request a council meeting
and take the seigniory.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:03.731
But...

01:20:06.531 --> 01:20:07.698
But?

01:20:09.864 --> 01:20:11.797
But I fear you, brother.

01:20:13.498 --> 01:20:15.797
I said I will stand by you
until I die, brother.

01:20:16.131 --> 01:20:19.797
-Why do you fear me?
-Agreed. I have no doubt of that.

01:20:20.297 --> 01:20:22.398
I know that you do not want to be Bey.

01:20:23.664 --> 01:20:29.198
But when I make a wrong decision
by your standards, what will you do?

01:20:33.231 --> 01:20:38.331
I remember the day you brought
Halime and his father to the tribe.

01:20:40.164 --> 01:20:44.831
I remember how you acted against my dad
to not give them over to Karatoygar.

01:20:45.764 --> 01:20:47.498
The matter of the Templars, too.

01:20:48.664 --> 01:20:53.364
You acted against me, my mother,
the council and the tribe...

01:20:53.564 --> 01:20:55.664
...not just my father.

01:20:58.231 --> 01:21:01.598
You are a headstrong,
tactless person, Ertugrul.

01:21:03.531 --> 01:21:07.431
But a tactless person who turns out
to be right, most of the time.

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:13.664
God knows that you drove us
to the cliff's edge many times.

01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:19.731
You did but you also saved us
with your own hands. As you do now.

01:21:21.898 --> 01:21:27.798
I am trying to say that if we
face each other one day...

01:21:31.398 --> 01:21:35.298
...I am not the late Suleyman Shah,
I cannot put you in your place.

01:21:36.098 --> 01:21:38.564
And you are not a child.
I cannot beat you.

01:21:40.598 --> 01:21:41.864
Tell me, brother.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:46.598
If I make a wrong decision one day...

01:21:47.698 --> 01:21:49.831
...will you stand by me uprightly?

01:22:03.098 --> 01:22:05.231
Good luck with your seigniory, brother.

01:22:05.464 --> 01:22:07.398
Your brother would die for you.

01:22:59.398 --> 01:23:01.698
There is no news from Hayme's marquee.

01:23:02.131 --> 01:23:05.131
People are grumbling outside, waiting.
What will we do?

01:23:09.164 --> 01:23:11.564
If there is no news,
it means that she is alive.

01:23:13.231 --> 01:23:15.431
While she is alive,
we should get a move on.

01:23:16.864 --> 01:23:18.164
How?

01:23:18.398 --> 01:23:20.698
First, we will take Ertugrul,
who is the killer.

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.898
If Hayme Hatun dies...

01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:28.164
...it means that Korkut Bey
is a killer, too.

01:23:29.231 --> 01:23:30.864
We will talk about this later.

01:23:32.198 --> 01:23:33.864
If we take Ertugrul...

01:23:34.898 --> 01:23:38.131
...we can calm down
Sadettin Kobek's rage.

01:23:40.431 --> 01:23:43.164
You need to persuade Gundogdu.

01:23:45.431 --> 01:23:47.564
My favorite thing is bargaining, Aytolun.

01:23:53.198 --> 01:23:55.164
You will help me.

01:24:23.531 --> 01:24:24.864
If he dies...

01:24:26.731 --> 01:24:28.498
...we need to find another way.

01:24:28.698 --> 01:24:30.631
Then our Bey will be ruined.

01:24:38.398 --> 01:24:39.864
-Artuk Bey.
-Peace be upon you.

01:24:40.098 --> 01:24:42.231
-And peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:24:42.298 --> 01:24:44.398
-How is he?
-He needs a healer.

01:24:51.698 --> 01:24:52.898
In God's name.

01:25:25.631 --> 01:25:27.298
He lost a lot of blood.

01:25:31.831 --> 01:25:33.464
It is a miracle that he is still alive.

01:25:35.098 --> 01:25:37.131
Do not give in, Bey, fight.

01:25:37.798 --> 01:25:39.698
Fight so the tribe can stay united.

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:04.764
-Everyone has a different expertise.
-Right, my sheikh.

01:26:16.531 --> 01:26:18.531
Beys, things are complicated
in the marquee.

01:26:20.764 --> 01:26:22.564
Ertugrul killed Kocabash.

01:26:23.831 --> 01:26:25.364
<i>Allahuakhbar.</i>

01:26:25.631 --> 01:26:27.331
Finally, the traitor died.

01:26:30.898 --> 01:26:34.798
But Korkut Bey stabbed Hayme Hatun.

01:26:36.531 --> 01:26:37.864
What are you saying, Bey?

01:26:39.364 --> 01:26:40.398
What?

01:26:42.898 --> 01:26:44.698
How is Mother Hayme, Artuk Bey?

01:26:47.164 --> 01:26:48.431
She needs prayers.

01:26:54.631 --> 01:26:56.831
If we cannot save Tugtekin...

01:26:58.398 --> 01:27:01.098
...the sky will fall on our tribe.

01:27:02.898 --> 01:27:05.331
Then our Bey will crane
his neck to the rope.

01:27:06.464 --> 01:27:09.431
The Kayi and the Dodurga tribes
will be destroyed.

01:27:14.164 --> 01:27:16.564
What saves a man from
death is his fate.

01:27:17.831 --> 01:27:19.764
Do not be sorry, brave ones.

01:27:24.331 --> 01:27:26.431
Now, leave me alone with Tugtekin.

01:27:35.498 --> 01:27:38.664
Efendi, if you stay, you can help me.

01:27:41.864 --> 01:27:43.364
All right.

01:28:35.198 --> 01:28:38.498
-If Tugtekin dies...
-Ertugrul Bey will die.

01:28:42.098 --> 01:28:43.231
Bamsi is right.

01:28:43.698 --> 01:28:46.298
I can never imagine that
Ertugrul Bey's fate...

01:28:46.464 --> 01:28:49.798
...would depend on
this ambitious dog's fate.

01:28:50.898 --> 01:28:53.431
I will not leave my Bey's fate
in anyone's hands, brother.

01:28:53.531 --> 01:28:55.531
We will not. Sit down, Bamsi.

01:28:55.831 --> 01:28:57.564
What will we do if we do not?

01:29:00.131 --> 01:29:03.364
If the decision is his execution...

01:29:03.698 --> 01:29:04.831
which it will be...

01:29:06.764 --> 01:29:09.831
we will kidnap Ertugrul Bey
and go to the mountains.

01:29:10.831 --> 01:29:13.098
While we fight the Mongols on one hand...

01:29:14.631 --> 01:29:17.764
...we will not hesitate
to fight with the Seljuk...

01:29:17.831 --> 01:29:20.631
...whom we would have died for,
on the other.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.067
<i>Do we have permission, Gundogdu Bey?</i>

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.834
Come in, Dumrul.

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:57.034
Gumustekin Bey is here,
in front of the marquee.

01:29:57.834 --> 01:29:59.200
He wants to talk to you.

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.800
Traitor!

01:30:35.234 --> 01:30:36.967
Come out, Ertugrul!

01:30:38.667 --> 01:30:39.900
We want justice!

01:30:40.534 --> 01:30:41.767
Murderer!

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.067
Traitor!

01:30:46.167 --> 01:30:49.867
We want Ertugrul!

01:31:18.034 --> 01:31:19.300
Gundogdu Bey.

01:31:24.067 --> 01:31:26.134
I know how brave you are.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.634
More than that I know
what a cautious Bey you are.

01:31:33.534 --> 01:31:35.100
Please be prudent.

01:31:35.767 --> 01:31:39.800
Be prudent so that
the two brothers can control the tribe.

01:31:41.334 --> 01:31:42.567
Now...

01:31:43.967 --> 01:31:46.267
...give me Ertugrul for headquarters.

01:31:55.634 --> 01:31:57.167
Gumustekin Bey.

01:31:58.567 --> 01:32:02.234
You are a Bey who is one of us...

01:32:02.734 --> 01:32:07.200
...and you know palace customs
and politics.

01:32:08.234 --> 01:32:10.534
We put our trust in you.

01:32:12.034 --> 01:32:15.800
However, I will not give my brother
to you anyway.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:25.100
Neither my Alps nor people would believe
that justice will be served...

01:32:25.267 --> 01:32:29.234
...as long as Ertugrul Bey stays
in her mother's marquee.

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:35.700
You are a clever man, Gundogdu Bey.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.267
You must understand me.

01:32:38.834 --> 01:32:43.167
You must know that I want to solve
this without any harm as you do.

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:49.100
However, as long as Ertugrul
does not surrender...

01:32:49.567 --> 01:32:51.934
...it is not possible for me
to hold my Alps.

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.634
Do not let another fire begin.

01:33:02.967 --> 01:33:07.634
My brother Ertugrul has returned
to tribe by himself...

01:33:08.167 --> 01:33:10.667
...so headquarters would make
a decision about him.

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:16.134
Let him stay in his mother's
marquee until then.

01:33:17.967 --> 01:33:21.267
A man who wants to run away would not
come back to the tribe.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.700
As long as Ertugrul stays in that
marquee, I cannot handle my Alps.

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.600
They are so furious.

01:33:38.967 --> 01:33:43.167
How will you handle so many Alps
when I give him to you...

01:33:43.767 --> 01:33:46.234
...while you cannot handle them...

01:33:47.167 --> 01:33:50.167
...even if Ertugrul was in
her mother's marquee, Bey?

01:33:52.734 --> 01:33:55.967
No, Bey. Do not request this from me.

01:33:57.267 --> 01:34:00.700
Can you not see?
They all have blood in their eyes.

01:34:10.967 --> 01:34:13.634
I will talk about it with my Beys.

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:18.800
You also know that it is not a thing
between the two tribes.

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.834
We are talking about the Seljuk Empire.

01:34:22.967 --> 01:34:27.234
If Sultan Aleaddin heard about this...

01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:32.000
...he would have ridden here
to see Ertugrul quickly.

01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:39.567
Everybody knows how you have a strong
liking for him because of his reputation.

01:34:40.267 --> 01:34:43.167
It is the reason of what happens to us.

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:52.900
Things that Sultan Aleaddin did not know
are not capital city's matters.

01:34:55.034 --> 01:34:59.067
That is why you talk with your Beys.

01:35:00.134 --> 01:35:04.000
Of course, we could find a common ground
that would satisfy everyone.

01:35:05.067 --> 01:35:09.067
As long as we do not involve
dirty intents.

01:35:14.767 --> 01:35:19.867
Nobody can take my brother Ertugrul
from marquee...

01:35:20.867 --> 01:35:23.067
...that was given by Suleyman Shah...

01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:27.000
...before headquarters
make a decision about him.

01:35:39.134 --> 01:35:41.134
I have nothing else to say, Bey.

01:36:05.234 --> 01:36:06.667
My Alps!

01:36:07.834 --> 01:36:09.834
Great warriors of Dodurga!

01:36:11.167 --> 01:36:16.200
Our Bey, Korkut Bey does not want to
add more pain to his pain.

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:19.934
He wants everyone to trust justice...

01:36:20.767 --> 01:36:25.167
...and obey the verdict
that mores will decide.

01:36:27.534 --> 01:36:32.700
He says that there will be no blood,
no matter what.

01:36:43.134 --> 01:36:47.667
Hold your sword in its sheath
and your rage inside of you.

01:36:49.234 --> 01:36:53.000
If one acts otherwise, one must know...

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:58.667
...that I would put his head
in front of the Kayi marquee...

01:36:59.234 --> 01:37:02.967
...and his body in front of Korkut Bey's
marquee, to make an example.

01:38:15.234 --> 01:38:17.100
What does Gumustekin say, brother?

01:38:17.567 --> 01:38:18.667
He wants you.

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:22.800
I say, I should surrender.

01:38:23.634 --> 01:38:26.167
If I surrender, Dodurgas would calm down.

01:38:26.967 --> 01:38:29.834
You are right. I am just taking measures.

01:38:30.834 --> 01:38:34.767
Most of our Alps have either became
martyrs or betrayed us.

01:38:35.534 --> 01:38:38.267
We should keep a handful of Alps
that are left, on alert.

01:39:38.767 --> 01:39:40.000
Welcome, Karabek.

01:39:40.567 --> 01:39:42.767
-Greetings, Gumustekin.
-What is it?

01:39:43.067 --> 01:39:46.267
Sadettin Kobek wanted to make sure
that Ertugrul's head is being cut off.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.334
He sent me because of that.

01:39:50.934 --> 01:39:52.067
Let's go inside.

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.767
Our pain is great.

01:40:50.567 --> 01:40:53.167
You and your brother is fighting...

01:40:53.534 --> 01:40:56.167
...while you put your head in the lion's
mouth to solve this matter.

01:40:56.967 --> 01:40:58.267
You must know that, Bey...

01:40:58.534 --> 01:41:00.900
...outside of the tribe
is boiling just like inside.

01:41:02.067 --> 01:41:03.634
The traitor is dead, Yenge.

01:41:04.967 --> 01:41:09.667
Traitors die, however betrayal
stays alive inside of us.

01:41:10.834 --> 01:41:15.267
While my almighty God deems Oghuzs
worthy of bravery and beauty...

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.600
...he keeps betrayal alive inside of us
so we see and know its worth.

01:41:24.567 --> 01:41:26.967
It is not my uncle who made
my mother like this.

01:41:28.867 --> 01:41:31.900
Even it was my uncle's hand
which threw you that cursed knife...

01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:34.534
...hand who had him thrown...

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.267
...stays in her marquee and
making the way of betrayal.

01:41:38.734 --> 01:41:40.534
Who are you talking about, Yenge?

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.734
Aytolun.

01:41:44.134 --> 01:41:47.534
She imbues Tugtekin against you
and Gokce against me.

01:41:50.167 --> 01:41:55.334
The love Tugtekin has for my sister
and weakness Gokce has for you.

01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.934
She wants to use it against you.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:05.700
Do you think I do not know, Bey?
I do know it.

01:42:08.067 --> 01:42:13.267
Not only me but also Halime Sultan
and Gundogdu Bey know it as well.

01:42:14.834 --> 01:42:16.100
Also my mother.

01:42:17.834 --> 01:42:19.867
She knows but she still can't accept it.

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:21.567
I also know it, Yenge...

01:42:22.867 --> 01:42:24.600
...but I do not know why she is doing it.

01:42:26.567 --> 01:42:28.934
It is your job to find that out, Bey.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:33.134
You should be careful about
her brother Gumustekin...

01:42:33.767 --> 01:42:36.567
...and Gumustekin's daughter Goncagul.

01:42:40.567 --> 01:42:45.234
If anything happens to me, you must know
that Aytolun is to blame.

01:42:47.234 --> 01:42:50.600
Is it connected with the things
between you and my brother, Yenge?

01:42:53.167 --> 01:42:55.534
He does not want me anymore.

01:42:58.100 --> 01:42:59.167
Who knows?

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.167
Maybe he wants another woman.

01:43:04.534 --> 01:43:06.600
Maybe he wants babies.

01:43:08.967 --> 01:43:10.667
I cannot be mad at him, Bey.

01:43:11.967 --> 01:43:15.034
I am a useless woman
who is as dry as a desert.

01:43:16.834 --> 01:43:18.034
Yenge.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.767
Thankfully our tribe will become
cheerful with your baby's cries soon.

01:43:25.967 --> 01:43:27.300
You do not worry.

01:43:28.534 --> 01:43:31.300
Wild Demir would protect
your escrow to the death.

01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:34.667
If God permits, they shall go and
come back in a short time.

01:43:35.934 --> 01:43:37.134
If God permits.

01:43:55.334 --> 01:43:56.567
Come on, my girl.

01:43:57.034 --> 01:43:58.234
Come on.

01:44:06.567 --> 01:44:11.600
Listen, my girl. He survived the traps
that were set against our religion...

01:44:12.667 --> 01:44:17.567
...and the ones like in the palace of
El Aziz and the castle of the Templars.

01:44:21.034 --> 01:44:23.934
He will survive this one, too.
May you be at ease.

01:44:31.667 --> 01:44:34.934
All this time I have learned from
Ertugrul Bey that I should not fear...

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
...the enemy that eye sees, Wild Demir.

01:44:38.633 --> 01:44:41.767
I fear the poisoned air
that covers our tribe...

01:44:41.934 --> 01:44:45.700
...which we eat, drink and stay in peace.

01:44:53.234 --> 01:44:56.767
I seek refuge in God from enormity of
the djinns and people who are mistrustful.

01:44:57.567 --> 01:44:59.734
My God, may you protect us from djinns...

01:44:59.867 --> 01:45:03.734
...and enormity of those who whisper
evil things to people's ears.

01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:12.867
Let's go. Duty awaits us.

01:45:15.767 --> 01:45:17.234
Sure, my girl. Let's go.

01:45:30.634 --> 01:45:33.534
In brief, what I want to say is...

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:38.867
...we will wait until headquarters
debauchery is finished.

01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:43.867
That would be fine, if the miracle
we are waiting for happens until then.

01:45:44.734 --> 01:45:47.534
What if not? What if there would be
so much blood, Bey?

01:45:50.267 --> 01:45:55.567
We do not defend the head of our Alps,
who is my brother Ertugrul...

01:45:57.167 --> 01:45:58.667
...but we defend the justice.

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.934
If we give up advocating for justice...

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.767
...we would not have anything left
to fight for.

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.067
-Alright.
-Alright.

01:46:28.867 --> 01:46:29.867
Bey.

01:46:38.967 --> 01:46:41.767
I have something to say if you allow me.

01:46:42.867 --> 01:46:44.234
What is it, Goncagul Hatun?

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.267
-May it be easy.
-Thank you.

01:46:56.334 --> 01:46:58.800
-You go. I will come soon.
-Okay.

01:47:00.567 --> 01:47:05.167
You know since the beginning I had
no doubts that Ertugrul is innocent.

01:47:05.267 --> 01:47:07.067
I have told you.

01:47:09.534 --> 01:47:12.534
However there is one other thing
that I want you to know, Bey.

01:47:12.667 --> 01:47:13.734
What is it?

01:47:14.934 --> 01:47:18.634
My father thinks the same
but not because of his duty.

01:47:21.967 --> 01:47:24.900
You and your brother's job...

01:47:25.134 --> 01:47:29.067
...is to find a middle way to prevent the
two tribes shedding blood.

01:47:30.934 --> 01:47:32.600
This will not be so easy.

01:47:33.934 --> 01:47:35.767
This will be harder now.

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.100
What do you mean?

01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:44.834
Sadettin Kobek has sent
his ambassador Karabek...

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.234
...to monitor Ertugrul situation
more closely.

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:52.134
He is a dangerous man like a snake, Bey.

01:47:52.767 --> 01:47:55.300
You must know that verdict
has already been reached.

01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:00.300
My father should not be stuck
between you and Kobek, Bey.

01:48:03.267 --> 01:48:06.034
Do not put my father and yourself
in a tight spot, okay?

01:48:07.034 --> 01:48:09.534
They would probably want to take
revenge...

01:48:09.634 --> 01:48:11.934
...for Ertokus and his soldiers
who were all dead.

01:48:12.934 --> 01:48:15.600
They will surely ask for
Ertugrul Bey's head, Bey.

01:48:18.967 --> 01:48:23.567
Make my father's work easy
so justice would be served properly.

01:48:25.734 --> 01:48:26.734
Thank you.

01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:29.334
Dumrul.

01:48:51.867 --> 01:48:53.134
What is the rush?

01:48:53.934 --> 01:48:57.867
We all want Ertugrul to die.
However not tomorrow.

01:48:58.734 --> 01:49:00.967
-Even tomorrow is too late.
-Why?

01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:04.834
Tell me something that I can understand.

01:49:06.034 --> 01:49:08.200
Do you not see
how his Alps are royal to him?

01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:12.100
He is so powerful that he can make
his Alps attack Dodurga Alps...

01:49:12.234 --> 01:49:15.300
...with one command. Even attack Konya.

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:18.167
That is exactly why.

01:49:19.967 --> 01:49:24.200
One who has influence on these mountains
more than Sadettin Kobek...

01:49:24.867 --> 01:49:26.667
...one's tongue is chopped off.

01:49:27.867 --> 01:49:29.167
It is effective for everyone.

01:49:30.334 --> 01:49:32.100
Even for you.

01:49:45.634 --> 01:49:47.867
Gundogdu Bey is here and wants to see you.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.700
It seems that coming here
was a wise decision on my part.

01:49:54.834 --> 01:49:55.967
Tell him to come in.

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:26.134
Ertugrul will enter the cage tent.

01:50:27.867 --> 01:50:32.767
Gumustekin Bey. You will take
Dodurga Alps down the valley.

01:50:33.634 --> 01:50:36.300
And I will take Kayi Alps
down the stream.

01:50:37.767 --> 01:50:40.967
There will only be guarding
Alps in the square.

01:50:43.067 --> 01:50:46.734
They will be responsible for
the security of the two marquees...

01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.867
...the tribe and the cage tent.

01:50:52.167 --> 01:50:55.167
I thought you were more reasonable
than your brother, Gundogdu.

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:59.034
How dare you come here
and tell us what to do?

01:51:01.134 --> 01:51:04.867
We are trying to take Ertugrul
to Sadettin Kobek's headquarters.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.067
If you have doubts about our goodwill...

01:51:09.267 --> 01:51:13.934
...and want to show us our place,
you need to come here with more men.

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:18.300
Who will be the guard for cage tent?

01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:21.900
Alps from both tribes
will be on guard.

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:24.800
Kayi Alps will be around the tent...

01:51:24.967 --> 01:51:27.200
...and Dodurga Alps will be around them.

01:51:29.267 --> 01:51:34.134
Nobody will enter inside without
the permission from me and Ertugrul.

01:51:36.134 --> 01:51:39.267
You must know that if anyone
enters or tries to enter...

01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.634
...I would show no mercy.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.100
Alright.

01:51:52.634 --> 01:51:56.734
Headquarters will gather here,
Korkut Bey's marquee tomorrow morning.

01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:01.967
Commander Karabek will also attend
on behalf of Sadettin Kobek...

01:52:02.100 --> 01:52:04.200
...and the soldiers who have been killed.

01:52:05.867 --> 01:52:08.167
Our state is most welcome.

01:52:09.534 --> 01:52:11.300
We also rely on its justice.

01:52:11.934 --> 01:52:16.134
However whether we will rely on
Sadettin Kobek or not...

01:52:17.100 --> 01:52:19.667
...will become apparent after
tomorrow's headquarters.

01:52:20.934 --> 01:52:24.767
May God not let anyone
choose the wrong path of justice.

01:52:25.734 --> 01:52:27.634
Amen. I hope so.

01:52:55.167 --> 01:52:56.734
This will end tomorrow.

01:53:36.767 --> 01:53:40.034
Alps from both tribes will be on guard
in front of the cage tent.

01:53:40.934 --> 01:53:43.634
Nobody will enter without
your and my permission.

01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.800
If one enters,
he shall be killed right on the spot.

01:53:47.234 --> 01:53:48.334
Thank you.

01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:53.567
You take care of my mother
and our tribe, brother.

01:53:57.734 --> 01:53:59.200
I promised mother...

01:54:00.067 --> 01:54:02.967
...that I had to take our brother
Sungurtekin to her.

01:54:03.534 --> 01:54:04.800
How will it be?

01:54:06.567 --> 01:54:08.167
They will let you know...

01:54:09.534 --> 01:54:10.967
...if anything happens to me.

01:54:12.667 --> 01:54:14.100
Take him to his tribe.

01:54:16.534 --> 01:54:20.934
He has been serving our state
in the nest of evil for long years.

01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:59.334
Ertugrul Bey. Where are you going?

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.867
-It is time, Yenge.
-Bey, they would not let you alive.

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:09.067
While my brother is with me...

01:55:09.234 --> 01:55:12.567
...I fear no one but God, Yenge.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.967
-Give me your blessing, Yenge.
-You have my blessing.

01:55:30.767 --> 01:55:33.100
Traitor!

01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:35.834
Justice will be served!

01:55:37.067 --> 01:55:39.700
Kill Ertugrul!

01:55:40.134 --> 01:55:42.000
Kill Ertugrul!

01:55:43.867 --> 01:55:45.334
Murderer!

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:49.634
Traitor!

01:55:50.167 --> 01:55:51.867
Justice will be served!

01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:56.567
Kill him!

01:55:59.734 --> 01:56:02.300
Protect him or this would be
the end of everything.

01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:09.334
Kill him!

01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:12.800
Traitor! Pay for it!

01:56:14.334 --> 01:56:16.634
You will be punished!

01:56:16.867 --> 01:56:18.567
Listen to me!

01:56:25.634 --> 01:56:30.267
Ertugrul Bey has come to the tribe
with his own free will...

01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:33.767
...in order to prove his innocence!

01:56:35.234 --> 01:56:41.100
Now, with his own free will again,
he will go to the cage tent!

01:56:46.634 --> 01:56:51.534
Whoever crosses the line
will taste my sword!

01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:03.834
<i>Bismillah.</i>

01:57:16.934 --> 01:57:17.967
Alps!

01:58:20.267 --> 01:58:22.667
Halime Sultan and Wild Demir
passed from here.

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:27.167
There is an inn on this road.
They will stay there for the night.

01:58:27.867 --> 01:58:28.934
Come on, let's go.

01:58:36.967 --> 01:58:40.900
May you live long, Ertugrul Bey!

01:58:52.834 --> 01:58:55.267
May you live long, Ertugrul Bey!

01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:16.800
We will not let them touch you!

01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:29.000
Murderer.

01:59:30.034 --> 01:59:31.900
We have risked our lives for you.

01:59:32.134 --> 01:59:34.834
We have fought like lions
behind you in every war.

01:59:35.734 --> 01:59:38.600
And what have you done?
You have killed my brother.

01:59:39.534 --> 01:59:41.067
We do not want an Alp like you.

01:59:42.134 --> 01:59:44.000
-Murderer.
-Onur Alp.

01:59:44.967 --> 01:59:46.534
Control your anger.

01:59:47.234 --> 01:59:50.900
-Headquarters will punish him, not you.
-Dog does not eat dog.

01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:53.800
We know that there
will not be a decree against him...

01:59:53.867 --> 01:59:56.000
...in Beys headquarters.
-Do not talk nonsense.

01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:59.534
I would cut your tongue. Alps. Take him.

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:11.534
May you live long, Ertugrul Bey!

02:00:12.534 --> 02:00:16.067
May you live long, Ertugrul Bey!

02:00:28.567 --> 02:00:32.967
If anything happens to my mother, I would
make the sky fall on them, brother.

02:00:33.567 --> 02:00:35.234
If God permits, nothing will happen.

02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:37.967
If God permits,
Tugtekin will come back to the tribe.

02:00:38.034 --> 02:00:39.034
If God permits.

02:00:39.134 --> 02:00:41.100
There is God so there is no problem,
Ertugrul Bey.

02:01:48.733 --> 02:01:50.867
My God who saved me from such troubles...

02:01:51.967 --> 02:01:53.300
...have mercy...

02:01:54.733 --> 02:01:56.334
...so my mother will stay alive.

02:01:57.733 --> 02:02:00.567
So my uncle's son Tugtekin will return
to his tribe alive.

02:02:05.934 --> 02:02:08.733
Bey. Karabek is here.

02:02:11.267 --> 02:02:12.600
He wants to see you.

02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:14.734
Let him come in.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.700
-We have met again, Ertugrul.
-You!

02:02:33.934 --> 02:02:37.300
I want you to see the truth
and join us, Ertugrul.

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:52.834
Sadettin Kobek sends his regards.

02:02:54.234 --> 02:02:56.800
He also appreciates your great services.

02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:59.667
-However...
-However what?

02:03:02.334 --> 02:03:03.767
Now he wants me...

02:03:05.967 --> 02:03:08.634
...to take your head to palace.

02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:14.234
He said to take revenge of
brave Ertokus and our soldiers.

02:03:15.734 --> 02:03:19.634
If traitors were able to walk
from Sadettin Kobek's table...

02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:25.967
...to Noyan's table then to my uncle's
marquee freely and grinningly...

02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:31.234
...so it means that our swords
will not be rusted in their sheath.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.234
Traitor?

02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:39.000
You have said a suitable word
for a goatherd like you.

02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:44.300
Traitor?

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.834
Everything is done for the best
interests of our state, Ertugrul.

02:03:59.767 --> 02:04:03.900
And will you be able to hold a sword
with that cripple hand of yours?

02:04:05.334 --> 02:04:09.867
Or do you think that your body will still
carry your head after headquarters?

02:04:12.734 --> 02:04:15.000
So your death is here, too.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:25.100
We will see whose death is
here in headquarters, Ertugrul.

02:04:27.267 --> 02:04:28.667
Make it easy.

02:04:46.767 --> 02:04:50.134
We all want to believe that
Ertugrul Bey is innocent, Gokce.

02:04:51.234 --> 02:04:54.667
Korkut Bey also wants to believe
this even he is in a lot of pain.

02:04:55.134 --> 02:04:56.767
He is praying for this.

02:04:56.834 --> 02:04:59.334
He does not have a clear conscience
about it, Gokce.

02:04:59.567 --> 02:05:01.900
You must know that these are good things.

02:05:03.667 --> 02:05:08.600
If God allows, all of these will be
left behind. Listen to my words.

02:05:09.934 --> 02:05:13.100
But do not punish yourself anymore.

02:05:14.967 --> 02:05:17.934
My mother, my brothers...

02:05:19.267 --> 02:05:21.534
...and my sister turns their back on me.

02:05:25.334 --> 02:05:32.000
They do not want me because I sent
Tugtekin Bey after Ertugrul Bey.

02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:41.834
I do not have anyone else except you.

02:05:49.834 --> 02:05:52.100
A new world order is being built,
Gumustekin.

02:06:02.734 --> 02:06:05.700
You would want to go to war
against infidels...

02:06:07.034 --> 02:06:09.934
...and be a part of the expansion
of our state as margrave.

02:06:20.034 --> 02:06:23.900
Byzantium border is
really convenient for a holy war.

02:06:25.334 --> 02:06:28.834
You want this and we have
big respect for it.

02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:33.200
Our mores and religion
also want this, Karabek.

02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:41.134
However we would have such times...

02:06:42.267 --> 02:06:46.567
...that you would even have to go to bed
with the devil to get what you want.

02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:50.000
Who is the devil?

02:10:27.634 --> 02:10:31.734
For Kayra Khan who is wandering
in the super kingdom!

02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:35.000
-Fear!
-Kayra Khan!

02:10:38.134 --> 02:10:44.000
For Erlik Khan and his sons and
daughters in the subkingdom.

02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:47.300
-Khan!
-Erlik Khan!

02:10:48.634 --> 02:10:51.834
For the love of Muunchih and Musmal!

02:10:52.334 --> 02:10:55.034
Akkam and Karakam.

02:10:56.167 --> 02:10:58.734
Totem. Oge.

02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:00.134
Death!

02:11:00.334 --> 02:11:05.134
Muunchih, Musmal.
Muunchih, Musmal.

02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:07.834
For the blessed
generation of Chengiz Khan...

02:11:09.134 --> 02:11:12.300
...my brave warriors who deal
with death with pleasure.

02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:15.900
May you be a nightmare to Kayis.

02:11:16.767 --> 02:11:19.067
May you descend over them like death.

02:11:20.667 --> 02:11:23.000
For the love of Muunchih and Musmal

02:11:24.567 --> 02:11:26.534
For the love of Tengri Ulgen

02:11:28.667 --> 02:11:30.200
For the love of Tengri Ulgen

02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:34.900
For the love of Muunchih and Musmal
For the love of Tengri Ulgen

02:11:35.167 --> 02:11:37.100
For the love of Muunchih and Musmal

02:11:37.267 --> 02:11:39.067
For the love of Tengri Ulgen

02:11:39.267 --> 02:11:43.567
For the love of Muunchih and Musmal
For the love of Tengri Ulgen

02:11:43.834 --> 02:11:47.667
For the love of Muunchih and Musmal
For the love of Tengri Ulgen

02:11:47.767 --> 02:11:51.534
For the love of Muunchih and Musmal
For the love of Tengri Ulgen

02:12:51.874 --> 02:12:53.708
<i>Be prepared like we may go to Konya</i>
 <i>in any minute.</i>

02:12:54.341 --> 02:12:55.641
<i>You do not think about me.</i>

02:12:57.341 --> 02:13:01.341
<i>I accept death or life since</i>
 <i>I am on same path with you.</i>

02:13:15.941 --> 02:13:19.674
<i>I have seen such brave ones</i>
 <i>but have not seen a person like you</i>

02:13:19.908 --> 02:13:22.108
<i>who is carrying two lives and still</i>
 <i>fighting with evil, Halime Sultan.</i>

02:13:24.108 --> 02:13:25.274
<i>May God clear your path.</i>

02:14:19.808 --> 02:14:21.708
Do not talk if you want to stay alive.

02:14:23.608 --> 02:14:24.641
Come with me.

02:14:38.241 --> 02:14:40.774
We have everything that Sungurtekin
spent his life

02:14:41.007 --> 02:14:43.641
in order to take these
from Mongols, Wild Demir.

02:14:46.241 --> 02:14:48.974
Sultan Aleaddin will see both inside
and outside of the enemy with these.

02:14:50.274 --> 02:14:51.908
I cannot live with this embarrassment

02:14:52.341 --> 02:14:54.408
if anything happens to state
of my ancestor's Seljuk

02:14:54.808 --> 02:14:56.941
and to the things that Ertugrul's brother
had captured from Mongols

02:14:58.308 --> 02:14:59.641
after such torment.

02:15:04.174 --> 02:15:05.908
Do you have anything in your mind,
Halime Sultan?

02:15:07.408 --> 02:15:08.408
I do.

02:15:12.841 --> 02:15:13.941
I need a paper.

02:15:15.208 --> 02:15:17.608
And some ink. Right away.

02:16:28.108 --> 02:16:32.108
Sadettin Kobek is certain about offender
and the verdict of the execution.

02:16:33.874 --> 02:16:36.708
This will be over right after headquarters
tomorrow morning.

02:16:37.141 --> 02:16:39.408
We will not waste any time. Right away.

02:16:40.341 --> 02:16:43.041
We must stop Alps of two nomad groups
fighting each other.

02:16:43.208 --> 02:16:44.374
He has killed my son!

02:16:45.808 --> 02:16:49.641
We may have bloods of others like
my son on our roof!

02:16:50.308 --> 02:16:51.308
Let us have!

02:16:53.108 --> 02:16:56.008
If it is for justice, we all sacrifice
our blood for justice!

02:17:10.674 --> 02:17:11.974
Where did you learn medicine?

02:17:13.041 --> 02:17:14.041
In Samarkand.

02:17:16.108 --> 02:17:17.808
You came from madrasa then?

02:17:20.808 --> 02:17:23.274
I have learned both medicine
and rhetoric in the madrasas

02:17:24.041 --> 02:17:26.908
that Great Khan Tugrul Bey opened.

02:17:28.741 --> 02:17:30.141
How did you become nomad?

02:17:32.774 --> 02:17:36.908
I have become nomad and hit the road
so I can help poor.

02:17:39.108 --> 02:17:40.641
There are a lot of physicians in the city.

02:17:42.408 --> 02:17:44.074
Nomad people need help.

02:17:45.341 --> 02:17:48.741
I have hit the road from
region to region with them.

02:17:49.108 --> 02:17:50.141
Lucky you.

02:17:51.841 --> 02:17:53.308
Who is your master on medicine?

02:17:53.908 --> 02:17:55.941
Ibn Sina is my master on medicine.

02:17:56.374 --> 02:17:59.674
And Imam Maturidi on Rhetoric.

02:18:01.908 --> 02:18:03.741
That Great Imam from Turkistan.

02:18:04.908 --> 02:18:07.174
He has brought great things
to our knowledge.

02:18:08.141 --> 02:18:10.041
Those who benefit from it do not see it.

02:18:11.608 --> 02:18:13.841
And as long as Islam World
do not recognize him

02:18:14.074 --> 02:18:15.408
they cannot get rid of troubles.

02:18:15.808 --> 02:18:16.841
Alright.

02:18:17.074 --> 02:18:18.974
If God permits one day
we have a conversation

02:18:19.374 --> 02:18:21.908
and talk about Imam Maturidi.

02:18:22.141 --> 02:18:23.841
If God permits. Sure. Sure.

02:18:39.274 --> 02:18:40.274
His soul is leaving.

02:18:40.841 --> 02:18:41.841
My God!
