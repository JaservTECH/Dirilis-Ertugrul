Episode 46 will start after 12:28 min.

12:28.157 --> 12:32.157
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:33.377 --> 12:37.044
THE STORY AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED IN THIS
TV SERIES WERE INSPIRED BY TURKISH HISTORY

12:37.647 --> 12:40.647
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:03.817 --> 13:04.984
You were a little bird...

13:06.617 --> 13:08.751
and now you think that you entrapped me?

13:10.551 --> 13:11.617
Is it so, smart boy?

13:13.284 --> 13:14.284
Tugtekin!

14:34.251 --> 14:35.784
Your wife is as brave as you.

14:37.584 --> 14:39.284
She gave me a hard time in my headquarter.

14:40.817 --> 14:41.917
Be proud of her.

14:43.351 --> 14:46.517
And be proud of yourself.
But you both will die.

14:49.817 --> 14:52.251
Your honour is trodden, Noyan.

14:53.484 --> 14:54.517
I will teach you that...

14:54.717 --> 14:56.817
you can not do anything by kidnapping
a woman from the nomad tent.

14:58.617 --> 15:01.017
You are alone like an old dog
who got a kick, Noyan.

15:06.584 --> 15:09.651
You came to take your revenge, you
furious boy? Is that so?

15:11.984 --> 15:13.384
It is just like that day.

15:14.017 --> 15:16.317
Like that day you did sic your mutts
on me.

15:19.784 --> 15:21.284
My loyal cur, Hamza.

15:23.350 --> 15:26.284
You decided to bite the hand
that gives you bones?

15:28.350 --> 15:31.284
Come here, with pleasure. Come.

15:32.717 --> 15:34.484
You come first so that your commanders'
turn comes quickly.

15:41.251 --> 15:44.351
Ofcourse If they have the courage to fight
with me without their horses?

15:59.684 --> 16:00.684
Hamza!

16:26.584 --> 16:27.784
My loyal cur.

16:55.951 --> 16:57.017
Stay out of this!

18:48.984 --> 18:50.284
Be patient, Tugtekin.

18:52.751 --> 18:54.717
Death of this cur will not be that easy.

19:01.051 --> 19:02.484
I will give him another chance.

20:53.851 --> 20:55.751
So the seal was an imitation,
you smart boy?

20:58.384 --> 20:59.484
I appreciate you.

21:00.584 --> 21:01.751
You tricked me twice.

21:04.251 --> 21:05.284
But know that...

21:06.417 --> 21:07.917
...if you do not kill me now...

21:09.284 --> 21:12.884
...may the souls be my witness
I will torture to dead those...

21:13.517 --> 21:16.884
... who are in your inner circle, in your
nomad group and in your bed.

21:30.817 --> 21:33.317
-Long live, Gundogdu Bey!
-Long live, Gundogdu Bey!

21:33.584 --> 21:34.717
Long live, Gundogdu Bey!

21:34.951 --> 21:37.351
<i>-Allahu akbar!</i>
 <i>-Allahu akbar!</i>

21:37.651 --> 21:40.284
<i>-Allahu akbar!</i>
 <i>-Allahu akbar!</i>

21:49.317 --> 21:51.651
-Fetter this cur!
-Why do not you kill him now?

21:53.551 --> 21:56.017
I want everybody to see how this cur
will die!

22:11.317 --> 22:12.317
Hamza!

22:16.417 --> 22:19.251
Forgive me.

22:20.551 --> 22:21.551
Forgive me.

22:22.817 --> 22:23.851
Do not tire yourself.

22:24.017 --> 22:26.617
Gundogdu Bey will rush you
to the nomad tent. Do not worry.

22:39.851 --> 22:44.817
My mother gave me the name of that
great man who served our Prophet.

22:49.017 --> 22:51.051
But I could not even be worthy of it, Bey.

22:58.284 --> 22:59.951
I regret that too much. Too much.

23:03.884 --> 23:05.351
May God bless you.

23:07.417 --> 23:09.284
You gave me the opportunity to be a
martyr.

23:13.251 --> 23:15.517
-Give your blessings.
-You have our blessings.

23:15.851 --> 23:17.951
-You have our blessings.
-You have our blessings, brother.

23:21.384 --> 23:24.017
<i>Eshedu en la ilahe illallah</i>

23:25.951 --> 23:29.417
<i>ve eshedu enne Muhammeden abduhu</i>
 <i>ve resuluhu.</i>

24:18.984 --> 24:23.517
It was so stupid of you to trust
both Abdurrahman and Hamza.

24:26.717 --> 24:29.651
Now Ogeday will have a commander
that he deserves.

24:57.517 --> 24:58.617
I know...

25:00.417 --> 25:06.684
...that you are all ready to sacrifice
your lives for your ancestors,...

25:09.384 --> 25:10.784
...your tribe and religion.

25:13.951 --> 25:15.051
You are not scared.

25:16.284 --> 25:21.551
Because you are the
brave sons of Oghuz.

25:28.851 --> 25:32.351
But everyday...

25:33.651 --> 25:36.784
...there happens to be a new betrayal
in our nomad group.

25:41.651 --> 25:42.851
Traitors...

25:44.851 --> 25:47.784
materialised like a poisonous
grass in our nomad tent.

25:50.317 --> 25:52.417
Now they also entered our marquee.

25:55.551 --> 25:56.717
I say that...

25:57.917 --> 26:02.284
...if one of you knows anything...

26:06.517 --> 26:07.584
...say it now.

26:10.417 --> 26:11.584
Say it now...

26:13.317 --> 26:18.484
...so that we can clean this poison
from our nomad tent and our marquee.

26:21.451 --> 26:26.817
Mother Hayme, we grew up beside our
Suleyman Shah and in your hands.

26:27.784 --> 26:29.551
We know only you and serve you.

26:30.384 --> 26:31.851
We do not know anything other than that.

26:35.984 --> 26:38.884
Sheik Ibni Arabi wanted me to stay...

26:39.051 --> 26:41.517
...in your nomad tent to serve
Ertugrul Bey and you.

26:42.584 --> 26:46.617
I immediately come and tell you whatever I
see, hear...

26:46.784 --> 26:48.384
...and everything that you need to know.

26:48.917 --> 26:50.817
But we do not know further than you.

26:54.784 --> 26:56.784
I accept your marquee as
my marquee, Mother Hayme.

26:57.351 --> 26:59.717
If I hear something,
it is my duty to tell you.

27:03.584 --> 27:06.751
Do not tell anybody what I said.

27:08.584 --> 27:09.851
Now you can go.

27:10.784 --> 27:11.851
Thank you.

27:27.784 --> 27:29.651
It is for nothing that
we have suspected them, mother.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.484
Then who will we be suspicious of, Bey?

27:35.917 --> 27:37.817
Who could have betrayed us?

27:40.617 --> 27:42.784
From the person who knows
our smallest secret.

27:45.951 --> 27:49.551
I will interrogate everybody one by one
until I find that traitor.

27:52.584 --> 27:55.517
Until we find the traitor among us
neither we...

27:56.984 --> 27:58.751
...nor the nomad tent may have peace.

28:03.484 --> 28:05.784
No one else knows the secret of
the seal, except Konya.

28:07.717 --> 28:09.484
The news came to the nomad group
from Konya.

28:11.684 --> 28:13.017
Looking at the details it seems that...

28:13.817 --> 28:15.817
a person who has relations
with the palace must have done it.

28:18.651 --> 28:21.984
Then, there are also traitors
in the palace.

28:26.684 --> 28:28.451
We are in a big game.

29:15.517 --> 29:17.584
This place looks like no other place
we have ever seen before, Bey.

29:21.417 --> 29:25.717
And we are not like any other men
who has ever been here, brother.

29:33.717 --> 29:34.917
We are exactly on the border line.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.351
Those hills belong to
The Byzantium Empire.

29:42.451 --> 29:43.617
We will cross the border line.

29:46.651 --> 29:48.484
-Be ready.
-Yes, Bey.

29:48.651 --> 29:50.251
-Yes, Bey.
-Yes, Bey.

29:52.384 --> 29:55.584
My great God, you let me see these days

29:56.751 --> 29:58.451
thus I will never die in regret.

30:00.851 --> 30:02.984
-God help us.
-Amen, my Bey.

30:03.351 --> 30:04.651
-Amen, my Bey.
-Amen.

30:13.851 --> 30:16.684
Human means honour.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.651
It means that we are the
most honorable creatures.

30:22.484 --> 30:25.351
The most precious work of art of God.

30:25.951 --> 30:29.351
No man is superior to the other.

30:29.917 --> 30:32.651
We all are the children of Prophet Adam.

30:33.984 --> 30:37.317
No one can change this truth.

30:38.051 --> 30:40.684
Then what for this injustice?

30:42.017 --> 30:46.951
Why are you drudging to those
who act claim to be superior to you?

30:48.484 --> 30:51.951
You let them to steal your labor
and effort.

30:53.884 --> 30:54.951
What else can we do?

30:59.317 --> 31:00.917
Thou; Children of Prophet Adam!

31:02.417 --> 31:03.551
My brothers and sisters!

31:04.751 --> 31:08.884
What is it that makes them nobles
and you slaves

31:09.984 --> 31:12.484
on these blessed lands of God?

31:16.617 --> 31:17.817
They have been blessed.

31:18.784 --> 31:20.684
And we are bare-legged poors.

31:22.551 --> 31:23.951
God created us like this.

31:24.617 --> 31:27.751
They are masters and we are
worthless villagers.

31:32.317 --> 31:33.484
Children of Prophet Adam!

31:34.817 --> 31:39.617
I invite you to a truth that a humanbeing
is not a superior to the other.

31:42.384 --> 31:44.851
To a religion which people live
humanly.

31:45.617 --> 31:48.317
To the path of a pure faith that
no Arab is superior to a Persian...

31:48.651 --> 31:52.984
...or no Persian is superior to an Arab.

32:09.051 --> 32:10.384
What is going on here?

32:12.950 --> 32:15.950
We are working since the morning,
we are eating and taking a break.

32:21.017 --> 32:22.351
There are Turks around here.

32:23.851 --> 32:25.584
If you see one, let us know.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.317
You? Do you want to say something?

32:36.317 --> 32:37.384
The church...

32:37.584 --> 32:42.751
When will the church let us be filled
up like our noble commanders?

32:43.551 --> 32:44.984
How long will this torture continue?

32:55.484 --> 32:57.451
You are nobody!

32:58.717 --> 32:59.951
You are a worthless villager!

33:01.717 --> 33:03.417
Leave aside being filled up...

33:03.817 --> 33:07.851
...but if you want to even breathe
with your family...

33:08.817 --> 33:11.351
...do not say these words again.

33:12.417 --> 33:13.517
Is it clear?

33:19.384 --> 33:20.584
Now everybody go back to work!

33:41.584 --> 33:45.417
Tell me about this good faith

33:45.917 --> 33:48.584
that no one is superior to the other, Bey.

33:50.317 --> 33:52.484
I will tell, brother. I will.

34:43.351 --> 34:46.417
You prepare some food,
I will go hunting and be back.

34:47.351 --> 34:48.851
-Whatever your order, Bey.
-Whatever you say, Bey.

34:53.017 --> 34:54.317
Come on, Dogan.

34:54.484 --> 34:57.751
Our ancestors had said that the food made
by a man in love would be delicious.

34:58.584 --> 35:01.951
I will groom horses
and you show your skills.

35:02.651 --> 35:03.917
You, the bear of mountains.

35:04.251 --> 35:06.584
You come closer when there is meal.
You run away when there is work to do.

35:08.817 --> 35:09.884
Come on, brothers.

35:10.851 --> 35:12.917
I will go and light a fire.
-Go along.

35:45.551 --> 35:47.617
Mother Hayme does not know
what she is doing anymore.

35:47.917 --> 35:49.317
I hope nothing is wrong, Gokce?

35:52.917 --> 35:54.584
It is not good, Aytolun Hatun.

35:55.384 --> 35:56.617
It is not good at all.

35:58.051 --> 36:00.417
What I witnessed is just evil.

36:01.951 --> 36:03.851
She queried the Alps...

36:04.684 --> 36:06.917
...that she raised herself and
even the dervish of Ibn Arabi.

36:08.817 --> 36:10.784
She is suspicious of everybody...

36:11.617 --> 36:14.417
...because of the consignation
lost in the marquee.

36:14.651 --> 36:16.784
What she is going through
is hard on Hayme.

36:17.351 --> 36:19.517
She lost her mind now.

36:20.817 --> 36:22.951
She make the people around her
to pay for...

36:23.284 --> 36:25.284
...the shame of not being able to protect
her own marquee.

36:27.451 --> 36:29.351
This is the thing that is bothering me
the most.

36:29.851 --> 36:31.584
She plays with people's prides.

36:32.584 --> 36:34.351
She thinks that they are thieves.

36:37.584 --> 36:39.417
Then you are lucky, Gokce Hatun.

36:40.384 --> 36:42.584
She has not thought of you as a thief
and query you.

36:44.551 --> 36:45.717
I thought so too.

36:47.417 --> 36:48.551
But I was wrong.

36:49.884 --> 36:52.651
She said that she will question everyone
who comes and goes to the marquee.

36:55.884 --> 36:56.884
All of us.

36:59.817 --> 37:02.851
We just needed for her to think
that there are thieves in our marquee.

37:17.717 --> 37:19.884
There is still no news from Gundogdu
and Selcan.

37:21.051 --> 37:22.384
Where are they?

37:23.817 --> 37:27.751
Everyday our suffering and anger
increases more and more.

37:30.017 --> 37:31.884
Who has a hand in this, son?

37:34.584 --> 37:37.451
Hatemongers of Seljukian palace
have a hand in this, mother.

37:38.817 --> 37:40.417
The enemies of Sultan Alaeddin.

37:41.917 --> 37:46.817
So why did Noyan kidnap Selcan
to have the seal, son?

37:48.817 --> 37:50.784
Obviously, there are also some other
benefits in this.

37:52.317 --> 37:56.584
Those benefits are right here in your
marquee, mother.

38:00.417 --> 38:03.351
Who would have a benefit in my marquee?

38:04.617 --> 38:06.451
What a horrible trouble is this!

38:07.684 --> 38:09.584
It is obvious that someone in our
marquee...

38:10.984 --> 38:12.951
...is under the command of our Sultan's
enemies.

38:13.984 --> 38:15.417
What are you saying, son?

38:16.284 --> 38:19.251
The only person who has a relation
with the palace is Gumustekin.

38:20.017 --> 38:21.884
My son will marry with his daughter.

38:30.417 --> 38:33.317
I do not say anything bad
about Gumustekin Bey, mother.

38:36.484 --> 38:39.551
We saw how Gumustekin and Aytolun

38:39.751 --> 38:43.351
fought when mutts of Noyan
attacked to the nomad tent.

38:44.917 --> 38:47.584
Aytolun saved my life and Selcan's.

38:53.317 --> 38:58.251
Whwn It is very difficult wvwn to think
about it, I can not imagine fighting...

39:00.351 --> 39:03.251
...-with them, son.
-Mother, I will go nowhere...

39:03.784 --> 39:06.651
without finding and cutting that hand
which reaches to your marquee.

39:37.831 --> 39:40.531
El fatiha for the soul of the decedent.

40:21.464 --> 40:23.997
You gave hard times to Noyan in his den.
He said it.

40:26.431 --> 40:27.531
I am sure, he tells the truth.

40:29.997 --> 40:33.331
I am the daughter of Suleyman Shah
and the wife of Gundogdu Bey.

40:34.464 --> 40:35.964
It was too little what I did
to this ignoble, Bey.

40:36.797 --> 40:41.964
I should take his eyes out with my nails
and take his kidney out with my hands.

40:45.697 --> 40:48.697
Then I should not put you and
our Alps into this trouble.

40:50.831 --> 40:52.664
Everybody talks about it, Selcan Hatun.

40:54.231 --> 40:56.597
They say that what Beys and Alps
could not do

40:56.764 --> 41:00.564
Selcan Hatun will do with her teeth.
She will take Noyan's kidney out.

41:10.664 --> 41:11.831
Gundogdu.

41:13.431 --> 41:18.664
You made the imitation of what this
Noyan dog wanted and saved me.

41:19.631 --> 41:21.597
What else can I ask for in this world?

41:22.731 --> 41:24.864
God bless you for thousand times.

41:26.231 --> 41:27.431
God bless you too.

41:30.231 --> 41:31.464
Selcan.

41:32.831 --> 41:36.297
I would come and sleep in your bed
in your marquee that night.

41:38.731 --> 41:40.231
But it was not in my destiny.

41:41.264 --> 41:43.531
If it would none of them
would happen to us.

41:47.764 --> 41:51.864
If you would come to my marquee that
night, you would not catch Noyan Bey.

41:54.497 --> 41:58.597
They say, every cloud has a silver lining.
This is the good thing.

42:02.231 --> 42:06.431
I say that thankfully I had this trouble.
Do not worry about it.

42:38.897 --> 42:42.464
Are you looking for your trouble
with your demon eyes, Noyan?

42:45.697 --> 42:47.797
Do you want to make me angry
and kill you here?

42:53.231 --> 42:55.797
You hit it off because I degraded you
like a bug

42:57.331 --> 42:58.864
and throw you to a well furious boy.

43:01.964 --> 43:05.997
You are mad because Gundogdu
did not kill me here quickly.

43:10.731 --> 43:11.864
You will die.

43:14.864 --> 43:17.231
Your carcase will rot away
in the middle of the nomad tent.

43:20.231 --> 43:23.031
I will listen how small worms nibble
the pieces of meat

43:23.364 --> 43:24.997
sticking to the raven's nibs.

43:27.331 --> 43:30.697
Hungry dogs will eat each other
to break up your bones.

43:32.931 --> 43:37.597
And when your bones are broken
I will listen the sound of bones, Noyan.

43:44.997 --> 43:47.731
Oh, furious boy, oh! Stop there.

43:48.997 --> 43:50.831
Where there is life, there is hope.

43:52.897 --> 43:54.564
This is such a war

43:57.564 --> 44:01.231
that a shepherd that herds ox
like you may not understand.

44:04.631 --> 44:08.397
It is not like to play with your
furious woman, Gokce like you.

44:23.731 --> 44:25.797
Clever boy will take me to the nomad tent.

44:27.297 --> 44:29.797
He will gain a reputation. What about you?

44:32.864 --> 44:38.264
You will lose your honor, pride,
nomad tent and everything.

44:41.797 --> 44:44.364
Very soon, they will take your
father's marquee from you.

44:47.664 --> 44:51.231
You will only be putty in your
furious woman's hands.

45:09.931 --> 45:10.997
Tugtekin!

45:12.297 --> 45:13.397
It is enough.

45:21.731 --> 45:24.997
Alps! Take him from here and
tie him up to my horseback.

45:25.964 --> 45:27.331
We will be on the way soon.

45:52.497 --> 45:53.564
I hope nothing is wrong?

45:58.031 --> 45:59.031
Praise be!

46:01.397 --> 46:02.964
Your foot is healed very well.

46:04.831 --> 46:07.231
The medicine that Artuk Bey
gave me served its purpose.

46:10.364 --> 46:13.764
Tell me which wild storm brought you here?

46:14.431 --> 46:16.764
Hayme. She lost her mind.

46:18.231 --> 46:21.897
She questioned everybody who comes and
goes to the marquee because of the seal.

46:22.764 --> 46:25.897
Moreover, Korkut grants her sister right.

46:28.797 --> 46:31.464
I said that this seal will
afflict with us, father.

46:34.764 --> 46:39.264
If somebody knows that we had this seal

46:44.564 --> 46:46.297
we lose our reputation.

46:47.397 --> 46:50.431
Moreover, we will be accused by theft.

46:52.831 --> 46:55.564
Your margrave remains as a dream
in the past, brother.

46:59.564 --> 47:02.931
Now it is time to depart from this
life for Korkut, Aytolun.

47:03.764 --> 47:06.031
But he should not die
without marrying off his son.

47:08.797 --> 47:12.464
-I will make him quite weak.
-If he dies before the wedding

47:12.864 --> 47:14.697
the work of margrave takes
longer than expected.

47:15.597 --> 47:17.831
He will die when his son is
in the bridal chamber

47:19.431 --> 47:21.497
so we can do the necessary for seigniory.

47:25.964 --> 47:27.397
What will happen to the seal, father?

47:32.297 --> 47:34.397
This seal will afflict with all of us.

47:37.964 --> 47:38.964
Give it, father.

47:41.864 --> 47:43.597
Give it and we can see our way now.

47:48.531 --> 47:52.431
I will not give this seal to
Sadettin Kobek without taking what I want.

47:54.931 --> 47:56.397
We are at the end now.

47:57.764 --> 48:00.397
We have nothing to lose
other than our lives.

48:02.397 --> 48:03.697
We will pay the price of it.

48:21.231 --> 48:23.797
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, Turali.

48:24.631 --> 48:26.664
Will Gundogdu Bey come back
to the nomad tent?

48:28.531 --> 48:33.731
Will an Alp come back without bringing
to account for his brothers

48:33.897 --> 48:36.597
and a man for her wife to the nomad tent?

48:37.497 --> 48:38.797
He does not, Artuk Bey.

48:39.397 --> 48:40.831
Good for you, valiant man.

48:42.897 --> 48:44.464
Stop here, I will show you something.

49:06.664 --> 49:09.497
Circumcision is the first condition
of being an Alp and a valiant man.

49:12.331 --> 49:14.564
This dagger is left me from my ancestor.

49:15.631 --> 49:17.264
From now on, it will be yours.

49:17.764 --> 49:19.531
-Mine?
-Yes, yours.

49:20.497 --> 49:22.697
But first you need to show
your valiantness.

49:23.864 --> 49:24.864
How?

49:25.764 --> 49:27.597
First the Beys need to come back
to the nomad tent.

49:28.464 --> 49:30.731
You will wear this first.

49:32.497 --> 49:34.397
Then this dagger will be yours.

49:38.864 --> 49:40.797
Do not tell me that you are scared.

49:41.297 --> 49:43.364
I cannot go to war
with this dagger, Artuk Bey.

49:46.264 --> 49:47.431
What do you want then?

49:47.764 --> 49:49.731
I want a sword as a gift
for the circumcision.

49:51.764 --> 49:53.364
Praise be, my valiant man!

49:54.831 --> 49:58.597
First you become an Alp, then I will
give you my own sword. Okay?

50:03.031 --> 50:04.931
We are overwhelmed by circumstances

50:05.297 --> 50:08.631
because of the traitors in our
nomad group for a very long time.

50:10.631 --> 50:12.264
We sight for peace.

50:12.797 --> 50:15.264
Before Kayis came to our nomad hroup

50:15.831 --> 50:19.031
it was a nomad tent of distinction
between the Turkmen tribes.

50:19.931 --> 50:23.797
Kayis came like an evil and caved in.

50:24.364 --> 50:25.464
Aytolun!

50:26.697 --> 50:30.531
Kayis are one of the most
valiant tribes of Oghuz.

50:31.531 --> 50:34.631
The valiantness of Ertugrul is told
by Turkmens from mouth to mouth.

50:35.831 --> 50:37.397
Hayme is my sister.

50:37.997 --> 50:41.564
Kayis and Dodurgas do not have
anything separated.

50:47.031 --> 50:50.764
You know everything better, Bey.

50:52.897 --> 50:55.564
But do not forget what I said.

51:49.697 --> 51:51.331
Are you better now, Bey?

51:52.497 --> 51:53.664
I am fine.

52:14.397 --> 52:15.564
Brother...

52:17.231 --> 52:19.264
...since we came here
we could not see any non-Muslims.

52:19.864 --> 52:21.464
Did we come to the wrong place?

52:23.664 --> 52:27.464
It is the right place, brother.
They are everywhere.

52:29.231 --> 52:30.964
You will benefit soon. Do not worry.

52:38.497 --> 52:39.564
God is sole.

52:40.231 --> 52:42.631
He is not born or gave birth.

52:43.864 --> 52:47.697
So does God has no child?

52:47.897 --> 52:48.897
No.

52:49.364 --> 52:52.597
If he had a child
would he be different from us?

52:57.864 --> 52:58.931
What about Jesus?

52:59.564 --> 53:01.231
He is the Prophet of God.

53:01.597 --> 53:04.997
And unfortunately, my brother,
when he has taken from the prophecy

53:05.331 --> 53:08.464
and you make him son of God
you commit a big sin.

53:11.531 --> 53:12.831
I have so many sins...

53:16.031 --> 53:18.797
Do not forget. God is one who shows mercy.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.497
But I do not show mercy.

53:22.931 --> 53:26.631
Now may your great God come
and save you from me.

53:53.897 --> 53:56.731
God! God forbid!

53:57.397 --> 54:00.231
<i>God! God forbid!</i>

54:00.897 --> 54:02.264
For God's sake!

54:02.864 --> 54:04.297
We get the chance, brothers.

54:04.464 --> 54:07.664
It is the sound of non-Muslims.
We are coming, my Bey!

54:08.897 --> 54:11.664
-Who are you?
-Ertugrul, the son of Suleyman Shah.

54:12.697 --> 54:13.764
Who are you?

54:14.397 --> 54:15.464
Attack him!

54:25.631 --> 54:27.731
-God forbid!
-God forbid!

56:53.897 --> 56:54.964
God sent you.

56:56.264 --> 56:58.597
Who are you, valiant men?
-We are Kayis.

57:00.031 --> 57:01.397
And who are you?

57:01.797 --> 57:03.497
I am Abdullah Bin Mahmud.

57:09.664 --> 57:11.364
Mahmud that Kirmani Master told me?

57:51.297 --> 57:52.297
My Bey?

57:53.831 --> 57:54.964
<i>My Bey?</i>

58:08.531 --> 58:09.664
<i>My Bey?</i>

58:10.731 --> 58:11.897
<i>Hang on, my Bey.</i>

58:14.464 --> 58:16.297
Alps? Alps?

58:22.397 --> 58:23.431
Help me.

58:28.631 --> 58:29.664
Move his head.

58:31.831 --> 58:33.331
Okay, my Bey. Hang on.

58:36.464 --> 58:37.631
Go inform Artuk Bey now.

58:38.364 --> 58:39.497
Immediately, run!

58:40.531 --> 58:41.697
My Bey. Hang on, Bey.

58:50.897 --> 58:51.897
I came, my Bey.

58:55.697 --> 58:57.331
My Bey, Bey.

59:00.364 --> 59:04.497
Do you see that what our nomad group
is tested with, Goncagul?

59:07.264 --> 59:10.564
As it is not enough what these traitors
did to our nomad group

59:11.897 --> 59:14.664
they have an eye on our marquee now.

59:18.897 --> 59:22.631
These betrayals pushed me
from one suspicion to another.

59:26.264 --> 59:30.631
You will be the wife of Gundogdu
and daughter of mine.

59:32.397 --> 59:37.631
You have to fulfill your duty
until these dirt is cleaned.

59:38.497 --> 59:39.897
You are right, Mother Hayme.

59:40.931 --> 59:43.631
But I am the daughter of this marquee.

59:44.897 --> 59:48.297
The misdeed made to this marquee
means that it happened to me.

59:50.264 --> 59:52.964
But there is nothing that I saw or heard.

59:53.697 --> 59:55.797
If there was, I would let you know of it.

00:59:56.597 --> 01:00:01.697
You exert yourself, maybe there is
something that you do not remember?

01:00:07.397 --> 01:00:08.731
I thought many times, Mother Hayme.

01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:11.631
There is nothing that I saw or heard.

01:00:30.731 --> 01:00:31.997
I hope nothing is wrong, Hayme Hatun?

01:00:32.897 --> 01:00:35.831
Do you look for your enemies
between your children now?

01:00:39.297 --> 01:00:40.931
Why are you so anxious, Gumustekin Bey?

01:00:41.997 --> 01:00:45.464
Why does a person who have been
in the Seljukian Palace like you

01:00:46.431 --> 01:00:49.897
rush that we do the necessary?

01:00:52.664 --> 01:00:54.464
What is it that makes
you angry, Gumustekin Bey?

01:00:55.397 --> 01:00:58.864
Everybody should perform
what is takes to clean this stain.

01:01:09.231 --> 01:01:11.564
Mother Hayme! Korkut Bey got worse.

01:01:12.731 --> 01:01:13.864
What are you saying?

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:38.031
Do not let me die until I see my son
get married, Artuk Bey.

01:01:43.497 --> 01:01:45.864
It is time to go to Konya with you.

01:01:48.297 --> 01:01:51.864
I want to consult with the scholars
who have more knowledge than me

01:01:52.897 --> 01:01:55.497
about the evil circulating in your veins.

01:01:55.997 --> 01:01:59.831
Where did it come from
to go to Konya, Artuk Bey?

01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:02.731
Do not create works for me.

01:02:03.364 --> 01:02:07.564
Bey, it is necessary to know what this
illness that makes you sick is.

01:02:08.564 --> 01:02:10.231
I know many doctors in Konya.

01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:13.231
Everyone is better than the other one.

01:02:13.664 --> 01:02:17.297
First the wedding will be done.
And then I will do whatever you want.

01:02:18.364 --> 01:02:21.264
I will commit myself to you.

01:02:22.397 --> 01:02:23.464
Thank you, Bey.

01:02:26.697 --> 01:02:27.931
Do you still drink

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:32.631
that syrup for power, Bey?

01:02:36.864 --> 01:02:40.931
You told Aytolun Hatun
that I should not use it anymore.

01:02:42.964 --> 01:02:44.331
And I do not use it.

01:02:45.531 --> 01:02:46.597
Thank you, Bey.

01:02:51.697 --> 01:02:53.964
Bey should use this medicine
until he gets better.

01:02:56.031 --> 01:02:59.031
It will help to eliminate the poison
in his blood.

01:03:00.831 --> 01:03:02.631
-Thank you.
-If you excuse me, Bey.

01:03:04.264 --> 01:03:05.264
God.

01:03:26.697 --> 01:03:28.397
How is my brother, Artuk Bey?

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:32.331
Korkut Bey is not seem good, Hayme Hatun.

01:03:33.864 --> 01:03:36.997
Like there is a poison that he cannot
get away with it in his body.

01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:43.597
That poison affected both the color of
his tongue and his eyes.

01:03:44.564 --> 01:03:46.331
I see that for the first time.

01:03:50.864 --> 01:03:52.364
Alright but what kind of poison is this?

01:03:52.631 --> 01:03:56.631
I do not know if his body does that or
it is because of the food and beverage.

01:03:57.631 --> 01:04:01.264
Only way to know that is
to take him and go to Konya.

01:04:02.431 --> 01:04:04.331
But he does not let it.

01:04:12.031 --> 01:04:13.231
Brother.

01:04:17.231 --> 01:04:18.231
How are you?

01:04:20.364 --> 01:04:23.397
I want to be grateful for living.

01:04:24.531 --> 01:04:28.564
But I do not have power even for that.

01:04:30.464 --> 01:04:31.931
Betrayal is everywhere

01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:36.297
and dirty trick is everywhere.

01:04:38.797 --> 01:04:40.864
Why do not you listen to Artuk Bey?

01:04:41.997 --> 01:04:46.731
Association of two nomad tents is
important than anything.

01:04:49.231 --> 01:04:50.464
I broke my son's heart

01:04:51.664 --> 01:04:56.531
and took the head seigniory
away from him because of that.

01:04:59.031 --> 01:05:02.331
Do I not know your good intention
and your good heart?

01:05:03.864 --> 01:05:08.964
Hayme, maybe it is my last wish

01:05:11.297 --> 01:05:12.831
from you as your brother.

01:05:17.264 --> 01:05:20.764
Do not break someone's heart
with your suspects.

01:05:22.764 --> 01:05:24.564
Do not destroy anything.

01:05:29.297 --> 01:05:32.997
If we do not come together
against the Mongolians...

01:05:36.797 --> 01:05:37.931
Brother?

01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:39.964
Brother?

01:05:42.464 --> 01:05:43.764
Let him rest a little bit.

01:05:54.231 --> 01:05:56.531
I heard that you are looking for those
who stole the consignation.

01:05:58.664 --> 01:06:00.764
I hope you will find them sooner or later.

01:06:01.697 --> 01:06:03.797
Be sure that it will not take
so long, Aytolun.

01:06:31.264 --> 01:06:32.497
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:06:35.297 --> 01:06:36.597
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.364
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:06:50.264 --> 01:06:51.764
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:53.664
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:07:11.397 --> 01:07:13.031
Give him us and we will kill this traitor!

01:07:13.831 --> 01:07:14.997
Kill him!

01:07:18.431 --> 01:07:20.964
You will die, Noyan! Kill him!

01:07:21.697 --> 01:07:22.764
Kill him!

01:07:24.797 --> 01:07:26.864
-You will die, Noyan!
-Noyan, the killer!

01:07:30.564 --> 01:07:32.364
Kill this dog!

01:07:43.497 --> 01:07:44.697
Noyan, the killer!

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:49.697
Kill our sons' killer!

01:07:58.831 --> 01:08:00.431
Noyan, the killer!

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:03.531
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:03.964 --> 01:10:05.531
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:05.864 --> 01:10:07.464
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:07.831 --> 01:10:09.564
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:09.897 --> 01:10:11.464
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:11.831 --> 01:10:13.464
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:13.731 --> 01:10:15.331
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:15.731 --> 01:10:17.264
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:19.031
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:19.631 --> 01:10:20.997
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:21.431 --> 01:10:22.997
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:23.597 --> 01:10:25.331
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:25.631 --> 01:10:27.264
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:27.631 --> 01:10:29.231
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:29.564 --> 01:10:31.264
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:32.264 --> 01:10:33.564
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:33.864 --> 01:10:35.431
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:35.897 --> 01:10:37.364
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:37.797 --> 01:10:39.297
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:39.731 --> 01:10:41.264
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:41.664 --> 01:10:43.231
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:43.564 --> 01:10:44.864
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:45.331 --> 01:10:46.864
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:10:49.997 --> 01:10:51.031
My Beys!

01:10:52.564 --> 01:10:53.697
My brothers!

01:10:54.831 --> 01:10:57.831
Valiant women of our nomad group!

01:10:58.831 --> 01:11:00.264
Warrior Alps!

01:11:01.531 --> 01:11:02.964
To be with God

01:11:03.831 --> 01:11:10.597
to defend God is Oghuz' blessed duty

01:11:11.597 --> 01:11:15.597
until this world is destroyed!

01:11:18.231 --> 01:11:23.331
We did and will not let the Mongolians

01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:29.597
that want to pass through
our land nomad tent

01:11:30.430 --> 01:11:33.897
and religion for long time
with God's help!

01:11:34.631 --> 01:11:35.997
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:11:36.464 --> 01:11:37.897
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:11:38.397 --> 01:11:39.864
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:11:40.364 --> 01:11:41.831
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:11:47.631 --> 01:11:51.664
Today is our victory day!

01:11:53.397 --> 01:12:00.264
It is the victory day that we broke
their hands that encroach to our flag!

01:12:01.697 --> 01:12:04.531
It is the day that cur Noyan

01:12:05.264 --> 01:12:10.331
who gave no chance to the poors
for a long time

01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:12.764
in this land kneels down!

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:17.897
Do not think that this victory is mine!

01:12:19.497 --> 01:12:22.531
This victory is ours!

01:12:22.997 --> 01:12:24.431
God is greatest!

01:12:24.764 --> 01:12:25.997
God is greatest!

01:12:26.564 --> 01:12:27.697
God is greatest!

01:12:27.964 --> 01:12:29.331
God is greatest!

01:12:29.597 --> 01:12:30.797
God is greatest!

01:12:31.231 --> 01:12:32.397
God is greatest!

01:12:32.697 --> 01:12:33.897
God is greatest!

01:12:34.331 --> 01:12:35.531
God is greatest!

01:12:36.564 --> 01:12:37.731
God is greatest!

01:12:38.031 --> 01:12:39.431
God is greatest!

01:12:39.864 --> 01:12:41.264
God is greatest!

01:12:44.897 --> 01:12:45.997
This victory

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:50.731
is the messenger of first light
that we expected!

01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:55.464
The hope of God is very soon!

01:12:57.464 --> 01:13:00.464
Our duty is to defend this hope!

01:13:02.031 --> 01:13:05.931
This fight is the fight of God and evil!

01:13:07.864 --> 01:13:13.364
Now I shout in front of you here!

01:13:15.631 --> 01:13:17.864
The victory is God's!

01:13:18.497 --> 01:13:19.597
God is greatest!

01:13:19.997 --> 01:13:21.331
God is greatest!

01:13:21.664 --> 01:13:22.831
God is greatest!

01:13:23.364 --> 01:13:24.497
God is greatest!

01:13:24.764 --> 01:13:25.964
God is greatest!

01:13:26.297 --> 01:13:27.497
God is greatest!

01:13:29.397 --> 01:13:32.964
We live and become martyr

01:13:34.397 --> 01:13:36.697
for this victory!

01:13:37.764 --> 01:13:38.897
God is greatest!

01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:40.531
God is greatest!

01:13:40.797 --> 01:13:41.931
God is greatest!

01:13:42.397 --> 01:13:43.531
God is greatest!

01:13:43.831 --> 01:13:44.997
God is greatest!

01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:46.697
God is greatest!

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:48.331
God is greatest!

01:13:48.597 --> 01:13:50.797
You will not have graves in this land!

01:13:51.731 --> 01:13:54.631
You will be destroyed in front
of the empire of the world!

01:13:55.897 --> 01:13:58.231
We will sleep with your women!

01:14:00.031 --> 01:14:02.597
We will water the land
with your horses' blood!

01:14:08.364 --> 01:14:10.397
My brothers! Stop!

01:14:11.797 --> 01:14:13.564
My Beys! Stop!

01:14:15.331 --> 01:14:18.597
We will hopefully give the answer
to this non-Muslim tomorrow.

01:14:21.697 --> 01:14:23.364
Take him to the trussed marquee.

01:14:25.397 --> 01:14:26.831
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:14:27.564 --> 01:14:28.864
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:14:31.964 --> 01:14:34.464
Killer of our sons'! Kill him!

01:14:37.997 --> 01:14:39.531
Killer of our sons'!

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:46.431
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:14:46.764 --> 01:14:48.231
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:14:48.564 --> 01:14:50.031
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:15:20.397 --> 01:15:21.631
Where is Noyan?

01:15:26.764 --> 01:15:28.564
He should already came back.

01:15:34.564 --> 01:15:35.864
Do not rush, Ulubilge.

01:15:39.464 --> 01:15:40.964
Noyan will come back with the victory.

01:15:47.664 --> 01:15:49.597
Why you are not with Noyan?

01:15:50.364 --> 01:15:51.531
I was.

01:15:52.497 --> 01:15:53.864
But he sent me back.

01:15:55.464 --> 01:15:56.931
You go back to the den, he said.

01:15:58.297 --> 01:16:01.531
He chose Hamza as a commander and
he took the control over the soldiers.

01:16:12.697 --> 01:16:13.697
Chain him.

01:16:50.931 --> 01:16:52.497
You talk very well, smart boy.

01:16:53.931 --> 01:16:55.697
Your nomad group is proud of you.

01:16:57.897 --> 01:16:59.631
But do not be so much proud.

01:17:01.331 --> 01:17:05.631
You hold the aces but
last word is not spoken.

01:17:08.764 --> 01:17:10.831
You love to talk nonsense, Noyan.

01:17:12.964 --> 01:17:16.664
I do not know how you can talk so much
while you are struggle like a bird

01:17:16.897 --> 01:17:18.331
in this marquee.

01:17:19.764 --> 01:17:21.831
It would be better
if you kill me immediately.

01:17:22.964 --> 01:17:24.531
You take your chance.

01:17:26.464 --> 01:17:29.531
Otherwise, I will not leave anybody
alive from your family.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:32.964
I will destroy your nomad tent.

01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:36.364
You keep continue to dream, Noyan.

01:17:37.264 --> 01:17:40.297
I will send another Mongolian cur
to the hell tomorrow.

01:18:20.198 --> 01:18:21.398
Tangut!

01:18:22.265 --> 01:18:24.465
Noyan was captured by Gundogdu.

01:18:25.331 --> 01:18:27.198
-What did you say?
-How?

01:18:27.398 --> 01:18:29.431
Hamza betrayed Noyan.

01:18:40.898 --> 01:18:43.031
Now is not the time
to beat your chest, Ulubilge.

01:18:47.398 --> 01:18:50.898
It is time to lead our army before
they fall apart with this news.

01:18:52.865 --> 01:18:55.265
We should not leave the soldiers
without a leader.

01:18:56.931 --> 01:18:59.798
Who can be the leader
to replace Noyan?

01:19:02.465 --> 01:19:05.265
Will you be their leader?

01:19:08.798 --> 01:19:13.265
I will do whatever is needed, Ulubilge.

01:19:15.765 --> 01:19:17.331
It's up to us now.

01:19:19.765 --> 01:19:22.998
You also need to do
what is required of you.

01:19:24.465 --> 01:19:26.131
You need to back me up.

01:19:28.998 --> 01:19:30.131
Servants!

01:19:30.931 --> 01:19:32.131
Gather round!

01:19:41.431 --> 01:19:43.498
Valiant Mongolian servants!

01:19:45.165 --> 01:19:47.298
Noyan was captured by the Turks.

01:19:48.031 --> 01:19:49.298
However...

01:19:51.365 --> 01:19:53.331
...do not let this discourage you.

01:19:54.998 --> 01:19:58.898
You have Genghis Khan's
warrior blood in your veins.

01:20:01.031 --> 01:20:02.931
Do it some justice.

01:20:05.831 --> 01:20:08.531
From now on, I am your leader.

01:20:14.498 --> 01:20:16.931
Noyan's capture by the Turks

01:20:17.098 --> 01:20:19.431
should not affect
our promise to Ogeday.

01:20:20.531 --> 01:20:23.865
We don't need Noyan
to shed some Turkish blood.

01:20:29.431 --> 01:20:31.031
Rescue Noyan...

01:20:32.165 --> 01:20:34.431
...so that we can trust
your leadership.

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:40.265
These servants are
here to serve Ogeday...

01:20:41.898 --> 01:20:43.131
...not Noyan.

01:20:55.765 --> 01:20:58.765
{\an8}TEKFUR PALACE

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:09.798
Great Creator!

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:13.165
Give me the power that you gave to
your son, Jesus.

01:21:13.398 --> 01:21:15.265
Feed me with your son's soul.

01:21:15.565 --> 01:21:16.898
Amen.

01:21:30.931 --> 01:21:33.298
Kostas wants to see you,
Commander Valentin.

01:21:33.465 --> 01:21:35.931
-It is very important.
-Send him in.

01:21:55.831 --> 01:21:58.065
What is the important news
you have for me?

01:21:58.531 --> 01:22:00.565
Your soldiers are dead, Sir Valentin.

01:22:05.465 --> 01:22:07.131
What are you saying, you fool?

01:22:07.298 --> 01:22:09.765
Who could dare to try
and kill my soldiers?

01:22:12.865 --> 01:22:14.498
A Muslim dervish, Sir.

01:22:15.565 --> 01:22:17.131
He was poisoning the people and

01:22:17.298 --> 01:22:19.098
your soldiers came to bring him into line.

01:22:19.765 --> 01:22:22.798
Several Turkish warriors came
out of God knows where

01:22:22.965 --> 01:22:25.265
and they killed all your soldiers.

01:22:27.898 --> 01:22:29.131
Turks?

01:22:35.298 --> 01:22:37.465
Now listen to me carefully.

01:22:46.931 --> 01:22:48.365
Father, father.

01:22:48.965 --> 01:22:50.298
Come here, my boy.

01:22:52.031 --> 01:22:53.531
Come here. Sit down.

01:22:55.231 --> 01:22:57.498
Look, I brought you
the brave Alps from Kayi.

01:22:58.798 --> 01:23:01.031
Welcome. It's great
to have you here.

01:23:02.398 --> 01:23:03.398
Thank you.

01:23:06.031 --> 01:23:07.431
What is your name, valiant man?

01:23:07.898 --> 01:23:10.931
Ali, Bey. My father calls me
Edebali. Yours?

01:23:12.431 --> 01:23:15.531
-Ertugrul.
-You are nimble like your name.

01:23:20.265 --> 01:23:21.998
What is the meaning of my name?

01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:25.298
It is written in the Divan-i Lugatit Turk.

01:23:26.065 --> 01:23:28.798
'Tugrul' is a wild bird,
and when combined with 'er,'

01:23:28.965 --> 01:23:31.065
it means a valiant warrior bird.

01:23:31.431 --> 01:23:34.831
When combined with you,
it means valiant man.

01:23:38.298 --> 01:23:40.231
Praise be on to you!

01:23:42.365 --> 01:23:44.131
Brother Ali.

01:23:44.298 --> 01:23:45.565
What's the meaning of my name?

01:23:45.898 --> 01:23:47.131
My name is Bamsi.

01:23:47.465 --> 01:23:50.098
I cannot answer every
question, Bamsi Alp.

01:23:50.265 --> 01:23:53.465
If you stay for the night then
you will have your answer.

01:23:59.831 --> 01:24:02.131
Of course they will be our guests, son.

01:24:02.298 --> 01:24:05.431
How can we let these
valiant men leave us so soon?

01:24:06.765 --> 01:24:08.031
Thank you.

01:24:14.365 --> 01:24:16.298
Since his mother died,

01:24:16.831 --> 01:24:18.998
it is just the two of us in this world.

01:24:20.565 --> 01:24:23.198
I want to send him to Damascus

01:24:23.365 --> 01:24:25.898
and have him study
in a madrasah but...

01:24:27.498 --> 01:24:29.765
If God permits it will be
like you wish, Mahmud.

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:30.965
If God permits!

01:24:35.498 --> 01:24:38.198
So, what brings you here?

01:24:39.331 --> 01:24:42.265
We are looking for a new land
to herd our animals.

01:24:43.098 --> 01:24:45.564
Then you found the right place.

01:24:46.365 --> 01:24:50.565
This land will both fatten your animals
and make you comfortable.

01:24:52.331 --> 01:24:56.865
I never came across more
prosperous land in my life.

01:24:57.398 --> 01:24:59.065
When did you come here?

01:24:59.765 --> 01:25:00.865
Why did you come?

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:07.398
Well, we came here to repair
broken hearts.

01:25:09.531 --> 01:25:14.898
To spread the flame that Hodja
Ahmed Yesevi started in Khorasan.

01:25:15.565 --> 01:25:18.931
Hodja Ahmed Yesevi
is someone to die for.

01:25:20.498 --> 01:25:24.198
How do you communicate
with the poor people here?

01:25:24.765 --> 01:25:27.265
The skill is to speak
the language of hearts.

01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:32.165
But the people here are heartbroken.

01:25:32.998 --> 01:25:34.365
They are injured.

01:25:35.465 --> 01:25:37.765
You have a blessed duty, dervish.

01:25:38.531 --> 01:25:41.998
God's word will be recited
everywhere from sunrise to sunset

01:25:42.165 --> 01:25:45.098
thanks to you and people like you.

01:25:46.265 --> 01:25:47.531
If God permits!

01:25:49.231 --> 01:25:53.565
And thanks to valiant men like you,
the tyranny will come to an end.

01:25:53.898 --> 01:25:55.098
If God permits!

01:25:55.798 --> 01:25:57.031
With God's help.

01:26:08.531 --> 01:26:09.965
Get better soon, daughter.

01:26:11.931 --> 01:26:16.065
God spared your life for us.

01:26:26.498 --> 01:26:30.998
Selcan stood against these scum.

01:26:31.798 --> 01:26:34.965
and showed how noble
the women of Kayi are, brother.

01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:41.465
Daughter, I want you to know
that I am proud of you.

01:26:42.165 --> 01:26:43.898
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

01:26:47.965 --> 01:26:50.298
But of course, my daughter's
being back in the tent

01:26:50.465 --> 01:26:52.298
doesn't mean that
the trouble is over.

01:26:53.031 --> 01:26:57.165
Betrayal is still in our marquee
as it once was.

01:26:58.098 --> 01:26:59.331
My mother is right.

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:03.031
We all have to be investigating
this issue.

01:27:03.965 --> 01:27:07.998
Our group will not find peace
until we know who stole

01:27:08.165 --> 01:27:10.931
the consignation of Sungurtekin.

01:27:12.265 --> 01:27:15.065
If we knew exactly what
the stolen item is...

01:27:15.231 --> 01:27:18.031
and why it is so valuable...

01:27:18.798 --> 01:27:21.565
maybe we could also help,
Sungurtekin Bey.

01:27:22.998 --> 01:27:25.798
Our privacy has been
compromised, Gumustekin Bey.

01:27:26.565 --> 01:27:30.865
Think about what the
person who did this is capable of.

01:27:35.298 --> 01:27:38.831
Whoever stole this consignation...

01:27:40.265 --> 01:27:43.865
...who knows which demon's
puppet he has become?

01:27:47.798 --> 01:27:50.965
And even worse, he is
too stupid to know

01:27:51.131 --> 01:27:53.831
which demon's puppet
he will become.

01:27:59.998 --> 01:28:02.098
Now I understand what it means

01:28:02.265 --> 01:28:04.431
to win many battles in the field
but to lose them in the marquee.

01:28:05.565 --> 01:28:10.998
Then you understand that both
marquees have to keep quiet,

01:28:11.165 --> 01:28:13.198
don't you, Tugtekin?

01:28:19.898 --> 01:28:23.765
You made me enjoy victory
in this age, my sons.

01:28:26.298 --> 01:28:28.198
May God bless you.

01:28:29.498 --> 01:28:31.398
May God bless you too, uncle.

01:28:42.065 --> 01:28:43.798
How's the Byzantine Empire doing?

01:28:43.965 --> 01:28:46.031
How do the commanders treat people?

01:28:46.531 --> 01:28:49.365
They do nothing other
than oppressing them, Bey.

01:28:50.531 --> 01:28:53.798
They take everything the poor
have and call it tax.

01:28:54.531 --> 01:28:57.198
They bully those
who cannot pay.

01:28:58.431 --> 01:29:01.131
Byzantine landlords
oppress the people also.

01:29:01.565 --> 01:29:05.998
People cannot find peace
due to taxes and sectarian fights.

01:29:07.198 --> 01:29:10.898
There is a massive gap between
villagers and the nobles.

01:29:18.798 --> 01:29:21.131
-Welcome, Kostas.
-Mahmud Efendi...

01:29:23.065 --> 01:29:25.131
...we would like to listen
to you together with the villagers.

01:29:25.998 --> 01:29:27.131
They are welcome.

01:29:27.365 --> 01:29:30.398
You would be my guests of honor.
You are always welcome here.

01:29:31.965 --> 01:29:33.831
It is dangerous to come here.

01:29:34.031 --> 01:29:36.998
If you come tomorrow, other friends
want to listen to you.

01:29:37.465 --> 01:29:39.365
All right. I will come.

01:30:25.165 --> 01:30:26.331
Are you all right, father?

01:30:26.998 --> 01:30:31.565
How can I feel bad after
seeing you two together, son?

01:30:38.431 --> 01:30:41.331
Come here.
Sit next to me.

01:30:47.031 --> 01:30:50.265
Sooner or later
the time of separation will come.

01:30:51.898 --> 01:30:55.998
I know that you will be
the new leader, son.

01:30:58.331 --> 01:31:00.165
The Beys want that, too.

01:31:02.031 --> 01:31:04.465
First and foremost, Gumustekin.

01:31:07.365 --> 01:31:09.398
Father, it is not the
time to talk about this.

01:31:10.931 --> 01:31:12.365
It is the best time, son.

01:31:14.065 --> 01:31:15.531
Now is the time.

01:31:18.298 --> 01:31:23.065
Do not forget these words
when you become a Bey.

01:31:25.065 --> 01:31:28.798
You should stand by
Gundogdu and Ertugrul.

01:31:31.331 --> 01:31:33.398
This would not belittle you, son.

01:31:34.331 --> 01:31:36.198
It would prove
how great you are.

01:31:40.865 --> 01:31:47.165
This corruption did not end when
Ertugrul killed Kocabash.

01:31:49.198 --> 01:31:50.865
It will not end either.

01:31:53.998 --> 01:32:00.498
Never forget that betrayal around us
is getting bigger everyday.

01:32:16.965 --> 01:32:20.031
Unite with your brothers
in Kayi marquee.

01:32:20.365 --> 01:32:21.898
Stay alert.

01:32:24.365 --> 01:32:30.031
Never let the betrayal destroy us.

01:33:05.065 --> 01:33:08.031
Smart boy took his brother and came.

01:33:14.931 --> 01:33:19.031
I never strayed from
the path of my ancestor, Oghuz.

01:33:20.898 --> 01:33:23.364
I made you the best man of Ogeday.

01:33:24.165 --> 01:33:26.298
I offered you the world.

01:33:28.131 --> 01:33:29.465
And what did you do?

01:33:30.431 --> 01:33:34.465
You betrayed me and Ogeday.

01:33:36.765 --> 01:33:40.431
How did you know that
I was in the caravansary?

01:33:42.865 --> 01:33:44.098
Tell me.

01:33:45.398 --> 01:33:49.065
You are not the only traitor
turncoat, Sungurtekin.

01:33:56.298 --> 01:33:58.465
Go easy on him, brother.

01:34:05.131 --> 01:34:07.798
He's not worthy of getting
your hands any dirtier.

01:34:14.365 --> 01:34:16.898
If you got these news, Noyan...

01:34:17.798 --> 01:34:21.798
it is obvious that this person is
from Sultan Alaaddin's palace.

01:34:22.765 --> 01:34:24.965
Maybe someone very close to him.

01:34:28.365 --> 01:34:31.431
I didn't call you smart
for nothing, Gundogdu.

01:34:32.298 --> 01:34:34.465
But if you were a bit smarter,

01:34:35.231 --> 01:34:38.265
the two us could tear
that palace down on his head.

01:34:41.498 --> 01:34:43.531
Instead of doing something like that

01:34:43.865 --> 01:34:46.565
I'd prefer to be killed by
my son with a blunt knife.

01:34:48.131 --> 01:34:50.331
Your offspring will curse you

01:34:50.498 --> 01:34:52.431
for being spared that blunt knife.

01:34:57.198 --> 01:35:01.265
Sooner or later, we will find
out who told you

01:35:01.431 --> 01:35:04.931
about the seal and
where I was, Noyan.

01:35:06.831 --> 01:35:12.298
And my only wish is to stick
his tongue to that traitor's throat

01:35:13.431 --> 01:35:18.298
and watch him choke to death.

01:35:23.331 --> 01:35:25.198
Come on, brother, come on.

01:35:27.865 --> 01:35:30.065
I will kill everybody including

01:35:30.331 --> 01:35:35.831
children and women in your marquee

01:35:36.498 --> 01:35:38.465
or even those I see nearby.

01:35:40.898 --> 01:35:44.365
I will disgrace you like
no Kayi was disgraced before.

01:35:49.531 --> 01:35:51.831
There is no such thing, Noyan.

01:35:52.198 --> 01:35:53.565
There is no such thing.

01:35:55.165 --> 01:35:58.565
You won't be just drowning
in your own blood.

01:35:59.965 --> 01:36:04.031
You will beg me to chop your
head off with my sword

01:36:04.198 --> 01:36:10.031
while those people that you hurt
are watching you.

01:36:12.331 --> 01:36:16.831
Your blood will be a disgrace
to the Mongolians.

01:36:19.098 --> 01:36:22.765
Hell will be your shelter, Noyan. Hell!

01:36:26.765 --> 01:36:29.998
Come along, brother, let's go.

01:36:33.465 --> 01:36:34.798
Alps!

01:36:37.065 --> 01:36:39.831
I will teach you a lesson
tomorrow, smart boy.

01:36:43.365 --> 01:36:46.898
You will curse the day that you
did not kill me with that blunt knife.

01:36:47.498 --> 01:36:49.431
Did you hear me, smart boy?

01:36:50.331 --> 01:36:51.898
Did you hear me?

01:36:52.365 --> 01:36:54.131
Did you hear me?

01:37:22.431 --> 01:37:26.431
It has been a while since we ate
together in our marquee, Halime.

01:37:27.965 --> 01:37:30.365
I haven't felt this peaceful
for a long time.

01:37:31.865 --> 01:37:35.065
The troubles over our marquee
are slowly fading away, Selcan.

01:37:36.531 --> 01:37:38.131
Bad days are almost over.

01:37:39.531 --> 01:37:42.031
You were worried
for no reason, sister.

01:37:43.131 --> 01:37:47.531
Look, Gundogdu Bey risked his life
to save you from that Mongolian.

01:37:48.965 --> 01:37:50.231
You are right.

01:37:51.031 --> 01:37:54.331
Gundogdu risked his life
and came to save me.

01:37:54.998 --> 01:37:57.965
From now on it is my duty
to make him happy.

01:38:07.065 --> 01:38:08.931
Wow!

01:38:09.098 --> 01:38:10.831
Look at that table!

01:38:11.831 --> 01:38:15.065
We cooked your favorites
together with Halime Sultan.

01:38:16.998 --> 01:38:18.331
God bless your hands.

01:38:26.998 --> 01:38:29.231
Did Noyan say anything?

01:38:32.331 --> 01:38:33.465
No, mother.

01:38:36.431 --> 01:38:38.398
We will kill him tomorrow
if God permits, mother.

01:38:38.565 --> 01:38:40.265
Let his words stick in his throat.

01:38:49.965 --> 01:38:50.965
Please have a seat.

01:38:58.498 --> 01:39:00.498
Bismillah...

01:39:41.531 --> 01:39:45.131
How long will you sit there
like you are angry with the world?

01:39:50.998 --> 01:39:53.931
Their love was frozen like Lake Aral.

01:39:54.498 --> 01:39:57.431
But now it gurgles like Amu Darya.

01:39:59.465 --> 01:40:01.865
I felt so stupid, auntie.

01:40:02.065 --> 01:40:05.931
When I saw them looking
and smiling at each other...

01:40:06.931 --> 01:40:08.831
I was about to lose my mind.

01:40:08.998 --> 01:40:10.531
I was about to lose my mind, auntie.

01:40:10.865 --> 01:40:12.931
Patience. Patience.

01:40:14.531 --> 01:40:16.565
When you are at the bridal chamber

01:40:16.898 --> 01:40:19.265
he won't think of anything
other than you.

01:40:20.931 --> 01:40:25.098
If he was happy in that
frigid woman's bed

01:40:26.198 --> 01:40:28.198
he wouldn't have fallen for you.

01:40:29.465 --> 01:40:31.231
Pull yourself together.

01:40:31.565 --> 01:40:36.865
When you devote your youth and beauty
he will be the dust on your foot.

01:40:38.465 --> 01:40:40.198
Now you go to the marquee.

01:40:40.365 --> 01:40:43.798
Go and show them who you are.

01:40:47.865 --> 01:40:49.231
I was not invited, auntie.

01:40:49.865 --> 01:40:51.165
I was not invited.

01:40:51.431 --> 01:40:54.198
You are a woman of that marquee now.

01:40:55.965 --> 01:41:00.998
You don't need an invitation,
all you need is a little courage.

01:41:01.298 --> 01:41:02.565
That is all.

01:41:05.165 --> 01:41:07.198
The tree was too big.

01:41:07.365 --> 01:41:09.065
I climbed it but couldn't jump down.

01:41:09.231 --> 01:41:10.765
I began to cry.

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:13.198
Help me get down.

01:41:13.465 --> 01:41:15.365
But she cried so much.

01:41:15.531 --> 01:41:18.498
Migratory birds changed courses
because of her screams.

01:41:18.998 --> 01:41:21.298
Then I saw my brother coming.

01:41:21.465 --> 01:41:24.465
I asked him to help me
get down for God's sake.

01:41:24.798 --> 01:41:26.865
He said 'No, I won't.'

01:41:27.098 --> 01:41:28.798
If I helped you get down,
what will you do tomorrow?

01:41:28.965 --> 01:41:30.798
You need to come down
the same way you climbed.

01:41:30.965 --> 01:41:32.798
-Did he not take you down?
-No.

01:41:34.565 --> 01:41:36.565
My brother is so stubborn.

01:41:39.198 --> 01:41:42.265
But you learned how to get down
from the tree you climbed.

01:41:42.431 --> 01:41:44.331
Yes, Mother Hayme is right.

01:41:44.498 --> 01:41:46.531
I learned how to get down
from the tree I climbed

01:41:46.865 --> 01:41:48.265
thanks to my brother.

01:41:48.931 --> 01:41:51.398
I had two broken fingers
but never mind.

01:42:08.865 --> 01:42:10.065
Enjoy.

01:42:13.031 --> 01:42:15.298
I came to share the happiness
of your table.

01:42:17.065 --> 01:42:18.931
Go ahead, daughter. Sit down.

01:42:24.431 --> 01:42:26.965
Mother Hayme, it was a difficult day.

01:42:27.131 --> 01:42:29.231
If you excuse me, I would like to rest.

01:42:31.265 --> 01:42:32.965
Alright, daughter. Go and rest.

01:42:33.565 --> 01:42:34.765
Gundogdu...

01:42:36.831 --> 01:42:38.965
...take Selcan to her marquee.

01:42:41.965 --> 01:42:43.265
Your wish is my command, mother.

01:42:49.365 --> 01:42:50.831
Good night.

01:42:52.365 --> 01:42:53.998
-Good night.
-Good night.

01:43:02.831 --> 01:43:04.098
Goncagul Hatun,

01:43:04.465 --> 01:43:07.131
there is some bulgur
at the bottom of the cauldron.

01:43:07.298 --> 01:43:08.765
Do you want some?

01:43:31.898 --> 01:43:34.465
Now, have a good night, Selcan Hatun.

01:43:35.231 --> 01:43:36.465
Gundogdu Bey.

01:43:39.865 --> 01:43:41.965
You came into this marquee,

01:43:44.231 --> 01:43:47.365
your breath and smell
filled everywhere.

01:43:48.898 --> 01:43:50.765
It is like the spring breeze.

01:43:51.431 --> 01:43:53.365
You breath life into me.

01:43:57.131 --> 01:44:00.298
When that evil Noyan caught me

01:44:00.565 --> 01:44:02.565
I was not scared,
not even for a moment.

01:44:04.031 --> 01:44:07.098
I knew that you would
come and rescue me.

01:44:09.931 --> 01:44:11.165
Selcan.

01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:13.898
Our marquees are separated.

01:44:15.898 --> 01:44:19.398
But you are still my wife.

01:44:23.531 --> 01:44:24.998
You know it.

01:44:26.131 --> 01:44:27.931
You gave me the world.

01:44:28.531 --> 01:44:30.798
What else can I ask from God?

01:44:32.131 --> 01:44:35.065
I know that I neglected you a little.

01:44:37.031 --> 01:44:40.198
But I will always be
with you from now on.

01:44:41.465 --> 01:44:43.031
Don't you worry.

01:44:52.131 --> 01:44:54.098
Will you stay with me tonight?

01:45:18.365 --> 01:45:20.265
I will see the prisoner.
Get out of my way.

01:46:13.265 --> 01:46:15.465
I will ask you only one thing, Noyan.

01:46:18.998 --> 01:46:24.931
What was it that you wanted
to take from Sungurtekin?

01:46:25.465 --> 01:46:27.231
And why you want it so much?

01:46:29.965 --> 01:46:32.298
You ask this question
in the name of who?

01:46:33.131 --> 01:46:38.965
In the name of yourself, Alaaddin
or in the name of Sadettin Kobek?

01:46:44.431 --> 01:46:46.165
What are you trying to say?

01:46:46.898 --> 01:46:50.465
I know you and
Sadettin Kobek very well.

01:46:52.031 --> 01:46:56.798
I know there is no limits to
what you are capable of doing.

01:46:56.965 --> 01:47:01.131
In order to be margrave
you run errands of Kobek.

01:47:01.965 --> 01:47:06.765
And you can be more cruel
than I am if necessary.

01:47:07.398 --> 01:47:10.465
I know everything.

01:47:14.998 --> 01:47:18.831
Do you hear what you are saying,
you scumbag!

01:47:19.431 --> 01:47:22.565
What happened? Are you surprised?

01:47:24.331 --> 01:47:27.031
Who do you think I am, Gumustekin?

01:47:28.331 --> 01:47:33.465
You despise me because I am a slave
here and will be executed tomorrow?

01:47:36.198 --> 01:47:39.131
Besides, you are not even strong
enough to kill me!

01:47:40.165 --> 01:47:42.331
You will face the fact
when the time comes!

01:47:47.531 --> 01:47:49.198
What fact?

01:47:50.065 --> 01:47:53.431
The fact that you lost the battle
before it even started!

01:47:55.265 --> 01:47:57.565
The fact that whoever
helps the Mongolians

01:47:57.898 --> 01:48:00.298
will grow and gain strength!

01:48:02.798 --> 01:48:05.965
I am the only one that can give you
what you want, Gumustekin.

01:48:08.798 --> 01:48:12.565
As you can see, I know everything.
This is the fact.

01:48:13.931 --> 01:48:17.498
When you understand it,
come and find me.

01:48:19.465 --> 01:48:24.431
You are a miserable, sordid

01:48:24.765 --> 01:48:26.765
and despicable murderer!

01:48:29.398 --> 01:48:34.165
Do you think that you can fool me
with empty words?

01:48:36.898 --> 01:48:38.931
You will die tomorrow!

01:48:40.831 --> 01:48:42.165
You know that too?

01:48:49.031 --> 01:48:50.865
Tomorrow is another day!

01:49:47.231 --> 01:49:48.565
Goncagul.

01:49:50.565 --> 01:49:51.931
What is wrong with you?

01:49:52.431 --> 01:49:53.898
What happened to you?

01:49:56.831 --> 01:50:01.231
His mother sent Gundogdu to bed

01:50:01.531 --> 01:50:04.565
with that whore right in front
of my eyes, auntie.

01:50:09.098 --> 01:50:10.964
What are you saying, Gonca?

01:50:11.398 --> 01:50:15.498
He took his wife and brought her
to his tent without saying a word.

01:50:16.964 --> 01:50:18.431
I went after them.

01:50:19.464 --> 01:50:22.098
In this cold, frosty weather

01:50:22.931 --> 01:50:25.498
I waited for him to leave
Selcan's marquee.

01:50:25.831 --> 01:50:27.198
But he did not leave.

01:50:29.898 --> 01:50:34.198
Obviously, tonight he will seek
comfort in the arms of this whore.

01:50:40.931 --> 01:50:44.798
Auntie, I will kill that woman!

01:50:46.398 --> 01:50:48.031
I will kill Selcan!

01:50:49.865 --> 01:50:54.065
As long as she is breathing,
this life is hell for me!

01:51:13.931 --> 01:51:15.831
While you were sleeping at night

01:51:15.998 --> 01:51:17.298
I was watching you.

01:51:20.331 --> 01:51:21.498
I dozed off for a while...

01:51:23.831 --> 01:51:25.298
...you were also in my dream.

01:51:27.531 --> 01:51:29.231
I hope that's a good sign.

01:51:29.465 --> 01:51:32.365
You were holding
a child firmly by the hand.

01:51:33.198 --> 01:51:37.031
Blonde hair, deep blue eyes like yours.

01:51:38.498 --> 01:51:40.931
You brought him
in front of me and said

01:51:41.431 --> 01:51:45.865
"Take good care of him,
he is our son."

01:51:47.231 --> 01:51:48.865
I hope that's a good sign.

01:51:52.365 --> 01:51:53.965
Excuse me.

01:52:04.298 --> 01:52:08.498
Dear God, please let me have a child.

01:52:09.865 --> 01:52:14.198
Take my life but not my child this time.

01:52:16.031 --> 01:52:20.465
Even if I die, let me do so
after giving birth.

01:52:42.265 --> 01:52:43.431
Gundogdu Bey!

01:52:49.165 --> 01:52:50.798
Yes, Goncagul Hatun.

01:52:52.098 --> 01:52:55.331
I want you to forgive me, Bey.

01:52:56.531 --> 01:52:58.031
What for?

01:52:59.065 --> 01:53:01.531
I came to your table
without being invited.

01:53:03.365 --> 01:53:05.331
Various things bothered me.

01:53:06.831 --> 01:53:11.398
The only reason is that
I was jealous of you, Bey.

01:53:14.165 --> 01:53:16.498
I was jealous of you and Selcan Hatun.

01:53:17.998 --> 01:53:20.031
What are you saying, Goncagul Hatun?

01:53:21.531 --> 01:53:24.865
I accepted to be your second
wife, I know.

01:53:26.565 --> 01:53:29.298
Nevertheless, Selcan Hatun...

01:53:31.231 --> 01:53:36.998
Goncagul Hatun!
Selcan has a place in my heart.

01:53:38.231 --> 01:53:40.231
I cannot tear her apart easily.

01:53:41.798 --> 01:53:44.465
But I also want you to enliven me.

01:53:47.831 --> 01:53:53.365
To enliven you and give you children
is my duty now, Gundogdu Bey.

01:53:56.565 --> 01:53:58.098
Thank you.

01:54:23.298 --> 01:54:25.265
You wanted to see me, Halime Sultan.

01:54:27.265 --> 01:54:28.898
You know why I called you.

01:54:29.298 --> 01:54:30.465
I know.

01:54:31.931 --> 01:54:34.431
I know but I said
what I had to say.

01:54:35.331 --> 01:54:37.765
Do not ask me to betray Bey!

01:54:38.565 --> 01:54:41.198
We only want you to learn the truth!

01:54:42.031 --> 01:54:44.365
Is Selcan Hatun's necklace
in the marquee or not?

01:54:45.398 --> 01:54:47.565
That is the only thing we want to learn.

01:54:48.365 --> 01:54:51.165
I came here out of my respect
for Ertugrul Bey.

01:54:52.331 --> 01:54:55.831
But this is enough!
Do not try my patience!

01:54:58.498 --> 01:55:00.065
What if Selcan is right?

01:55:03.465 --> 01:55:06.998
While Duru Hatun was alive,
Bey did not cheat on her.

01:55:09.098 --> 01:55:12.298
While she was alive, he did not take
Aytolun Hatun to his bed.

01:55:15.398 --> 01:55:17.198
We did not tell you this.

01:55:18.565 --> 01:55:20.865
Where does it come from, Banu Cicek?

01:55:25.165 --> 01:55:26.431
Stay away from me.

01:55:42.265 --> 01:55:43.965
Noyan knows everything.

01:55:44.865 --> 01:55:47.398
He knows about our alliance
with Sadettin Kobek.

01:55:47.565 --> 01:55:49.565
He knows that I want to be
a margrave. Everything!

01:55:49.898 --> 01:55:51.765
But how is that possible, brother?

01:55:54.831 --> 01:55:57.765
Mongolians have settled
in the palace, auntie.

01:55:59.131 --> 01:56:02.298
Who knows how many more
like Kocabash lives in the palace?

01:56:02.498 --> 01:56:05.098
Mongolians have already laid
a siege to Anatolia!

01:56:05.898 --> 01:56:08.898
Give this seal to Sadettin Kobek, father.

01:56:10.298 --> 01:56:12.565
We are walking to the
edge of the cliff step by step.

01:56:13.398 --> 01:56:16.165
We don't even know
what will happen after this.

01:56:38.831 --> 01:56:41.865
Hide this seal where
nobody can find it, Aytolun.

01:56:43.498 --> 01:56:46.165
After we punish that damned Noyan,

01:56:47.431 --> 01:56:49.865
it will be time to talk to Sadettin Kobek.

01:57:10.798 --> 01:57:12.965
Where will you hide the seal, auntie?

01:57:19.265 --> 01:57:20.798
At the marquee!

01:57:23.998 --> 01:57:26.431
Where I hid
Selcan's necklace.

01:57:31.446 --> 01:57:34.646
How did Banu Cicek know everything we
talked about Ertugrul, Selcan?

01:57:37.312 --> 01:57:39.446
Obviously, she knows something.

01:57:41.079 --> 01:57:42.512
She knows but remains silent.

01:57:47.012 --> 01:57:49.146
Maybe she knows even more than we do,
Halime.

01:57:51.646 --> 01:57:54.212
But I know my necklace is in the marquee.

01:57:55.412 --> 01:57:56.879
Aytolun is hiding it.

01:57:58.012 --> 01:57:59.579
She knows perfectly that no one could
ever get in there...

01:58:00.046 --> 01:58:01.312
...while there are guards
watching the cradle.

01:58:03.579 --> 01:58:07.579
I wish I could find my necklace. Then they
will see what I am capable of doing!

01:58:10.846 --> 01:58:13.112
I do not know what you will do
when you find your necklace, Selcan.

01:58:14.979 --> 01:58:16.346
But I know what I will do.

01:58:20.979 --> 01:58:23.112
I will enter the marquee
while Noyan is being executed.

01:58:26.446 --> 01:58:28.312
We will see whether your necklace
is there or not.

01:58:37.479 --> 01:58:40.546
If you allow us, we want to come with you
and see the circumstances of people.

01:58:41.979 --> 01:58:44.146
Ofcourse, Bey, you will honor us.

01:58:44.979 --> 01:58:45.979
Thank you.

01:58:47.979 --> 01:58:51.912
Tell me Edebali,
did you read all these books?

01:58:52.412 --> 01:58:53.446
I did, Bey.

01:58:56.579 --> 01:58:58.646
Good for you. Well done.

01:58:59.979 --> 01:59:00.979
Well done.

01:59:22.479 --> 01:59:23.479
Sir Valentin?

01:59:25.446 --> 01:59:27.179
-I have good news.
-Are they coming?

01:59:27.479 --> 01:59:29.179
Everything turned out to be as you wished.

01:59:29.612 --> 01:59:32.512
That fool believed it.
Those Turks will come with him.

01:59:32.912 --> 01:59:36.846
Well done. Now go and do not play into
their hands.

01:59:37.512 --> 01:59:39.279
If you make a mistake,
you will pay for it with your life.

02:00:36.012 --> 02:00:37.846
<i>-What did you tell her?</i>
 <i>-I did not say anything!</i>

02:00:42.279 --> 02:00:43.312
<i>What is this?</i>

02:00:43.579 --> 02:00:44.946
<i>I did not say anything!</i>

02:01:21.579 --> 02:01:22.579
We should go.

02:01:24.146 --> 02:01:25.379
You do not look good, Bey.

02:01:26.579 --> 02:01:28.846
Do not worry, I can walk.

02:01:29.946 --> 02:01:32.346
I want to see that mutt called Noyan dead.

02:02:12.179 --> 02:02:14.312
-Tangut, there is a letter for you.
-Give me that.

02:02:16.179 --> 02:02:17.179
Walk away.

02:02:42.979 --> 02:02:44.846
Your life is in my hands, Noyan.

02:02:46.879 --> 02:02:49.179
But I will not bat an eyelash.

02:02:51.279 --> 02:02:55.146
You will pay for all the cruelty
you did to me.

02:03:05.479 --> 02:03:07.579
You will also melt away like this letter.

02:03:25.946 --> 02:03:27.012
Tangut!

02:03:27.979 --> 02:03:29.312
Tangut!

02:03:30.512 --> 02:03:31.646
Tangut!

02:03:35.346 --> 02:03:36.479
You traitor!

02:03:36.946 --> 02:03:38.646
So, you want to kill Noyan!

02:03:40.112 --> 02:03:46.879
I swear, Noyan will scratch your eye out,
rip off your heart and eat it!

02:04:08.579 --> 02:04:09.846
What is happening, Tugtekin?

02:04:10.979 --> 02:04:13.079
I was told that you would do the execution
in front of The Kayi marquee.

02:04:13.912 --> 02:04:14.979
It is true.

02:04:16.212 --> 02:04:18.579
We attacked the den of that mutt
called Noyan all together.

02:04:19.112 --> 02:04:20.546
May God bless you.

02:04:21.412 --> 02:04:23.079
But you as are also aware that

02:04:23.646 --> 02:04:25.879
Noyan attacked our migration caravan.

02:04:26.512 --> 02:04:31.379
He tortured both my mother and her
children. It's her right...

02:04:32.546 --> 02:04:37.146
...to spill his blood. I will see that his
head is hung high up in the gallows.

02:04:38.946 --> 02:04:42.112
But cousin, this pride is
neither yours nor mine.

02:04:42.612 --> 02:04:45.446
This honor belongs to the father
of all of us, Oghuz Khan.

02:04:50.112 --> 02:04:51.212
Excuse us.

02:05:18.146 --> 02:05:19.346
The time is up Noyan.

02:05:20.979 --> 02:05:23.846
You still think that I will die,
you clever boy?

02:05:25.979 --> 02:05:29.379
You will go down on your knees and beg me
when we flood into your land.

02:05:30.879 --> 02:05:33.512
But Mongolians will attack on you in such
a wild way that you will not...

02:05:34.479 --> 02:05:37.879
be able to breath. So that you will not
even have the chance to beg.

02:05:40.246 --> 02:05:42.212
Untie him and follow me.

02:06:01.879 --> 02:06:03.412
Byzantine community is tired, Bey.

02:06:05.012 --> 02:06:06.579
They are voluptuous.

02:06:07.646 --> 02:06:11.846
Neither man nor women
are the same anymore.

02:06:13.012 --> 02:06:15.612
They are about to lose their homes and
society in the cause of pleasure.

02:06:16.512 --> 02:06:19.146
So they are on the verge of the demise.

02:06:20.979 --> 02:06:22.979
You can train a weaponless man

02:06:23.246 --> 02:06:26.879
but a woman who has lost her womanhood

02:06:27.312 --> 02:06:29.612
is like a knife stabbed
into the heart of a nation.

02:06:31.312 --> 02:06:34.012
If a nation lost it's ability
of being a family

02:06:34.612 --> 02:06:36.279
it means that it has lost everything.

02:06:36.846 --> 02:06:38.079
You are right, Bey.

02:06:38.646 --> 02:06:42.312
However, they are very wise especially
on fine arts.

02:06:43.279 --> 02:06:45.612
There are many masters working
in their cities.

02:06:46.046 --> 02:06:47.946
This is our greatest weakness.

02:06:49.146 --> 02:06:51.279
Our traders and profession experts
are very weak.

02:06:52.179 --> 02:06:55.012
Erewhile, we need to learn crafting
from non-Muslims.

02:06:55.612 --> 02:07:00.912
When cruel Mongolians destroyed our
cities, many of our masters passed away.

02:07:02.612 --> 02:07:04.246
They destroyed our memory, Bey.

02:07:05.879 --> 02:07:08.612
The cruelty and tricks of the enemy
never ends.

02:07:09.579 --> 02:07:12.946
What really matters is the things we can
or can not do.

02:07:14.112 --> 02:07:17.346
We need to teach our children some crafts.

02:07:18.046 --> 02:07:19.346
You are right, Bey.

02:07:21.879 --> 02:07:23.579
Would you like to give a break hereabout?

02:07:26.546 --> 02:07:29.379
Dogan, Bamsi, you pry around.

02:07:29.946 --> 02:07:31.512
-Yes, Bey.
-Yes, Bey.

02:07:44.112 --> 02:07:46.312
They will pay for our childrens' lives!

02:07:59.646 --> 02:08:01.279
Let God's justice be upon us!

02:08:02.046 --> 02:08:03.946
This man will have his punishment!

02:08:14.579 --> 02:08:16.179
Kill him! Murderer!

02:08:19.479 --> 02:08:21.146
Kill him! Murderer!

02:08:22.546 --> 02:08:23.846
Murderer!

02:08:38.346 --> 02:08:39.379
Kill him!

02:08:41.346 --> 02:08:42.579
Kill him! Murderer!

02:09:14.479 --> 02:09:16.112
I wish Ertugrul was here and

02:09:17.446 --> 02:09:19.246
witnessed this blessed moment.

02:09:48.279 --> 02:09:49.279
Beys!

02:09:50.612 --> 02:09:51.612
Brothers!

02:09:53.246 --> 02:09:54.246
Sisters!

02:09:56.846 --> 02:10:00.146
Thank God, the head of this traitor
Noyan...

02:10:00.546 --> 02:10:04.979
...who martyrised many of our brothers...

02:10:06.046 --> 02:10:09.379
...is at your feet!

02:10:10.446 --> 02:10:12.412
Kill him! Kill him!

02:10:13.046 --> 02:10:15.212
Kill him! Kill him!

02:10:15.646 --> 02:10:17.946
Kill him! Kill him!

02:10:18.346 --> 02:10:19.512
Kill him!

02:10:28.446 --> 02:10:30.512
Kill him! Kill him!

02:10:31.179 --> 02:10:33.546
Kill him! Kill him!

02:10:34.279 --> 02:10:36.612
Kill him! Kill him!

02:10:42.546 --> 02:10:44.879
Kill him! Kill him!

02:11:06.212 --> 02:11:10.046
Bey, if you let me, I will take some
to Dogan and Bamsi.

02:11:12.846 --> 02:11:14.346
This will not be enough
even only for Bamsi.

02:11:17.479 --> 02:11:19.246
Then he will learn to be patient.

02:11:21.579 --> 02:11:22.579
Good appetite.

02:11:29.312 --> 02:11:30.312
Now...

02:11:32.446 --> 02:11:34.046
...who commands this region?

02:11:35.212 --> 02:11:36.946
Which feudal landlords own it?

02:11:38.012 --> 02:11:39.412
And where are we exactly?

02:12:05.579 --> 02:12:07.179
We are close to Verakoma.

02:12:14.079 --> 02:12:15.179
Here is Prusa.

02:12:20.346 --> 02:12:22.312
Here is Konstantinople;

02:12:24.179 --> 02:12:26.212
Center of The Byzantine Empire.

02:12:27.112 --> 02:12:28.479
The Emperor lives there.

02:12:36.046 --> 02:12:39.379
Nikea; a holly city for Christians.

02:12:41.179 --> 02:12:45.179
Bible has taken its final version upon the
council that gathered in this city.

02:12:46.079 --> 02:12:48.612
Actually, the real Byzantium is there.

02:12:51.512 --> 02:12:52.646
What does it mean?

02:12:53.079 --> 02:12:55.146
Crusaders remained in Konstantiniye

02:12:55.579 --> 02:12:58.979
instead of going to Jerusalem
in their last journey.

02:13:00.112 --> 02:13:03.579
They invaded Konstantiniye.
They vandalized the city.

02:13:06.146 --> 02:13:09.246
They slaughtered their own
coreligionists wildly.

02:13:11.612 --> 02:13:13.112
Their own coreligionists?

02:13:14.112 --> 02:13:15.112
Yes.

02:13:17.146 --> 02:13:19.912
The ones witnessed the savagery say
that...

02:13:20.079 --> 02:13:22.312
...Konstantiniye had gone through the
greatest savagery of it's history.

02:13:26.312 --> 02:13:31.079
The Empire in Nikea was founded by The
Emperor who escaped from Byzantium.

02:13:32.612 --> 02:13:34.879
Now Vatakis rules there.

02:13:36.246 --> 02:13:39.179
They are at daggers drawn
with the emperor in Konstantiniye.

02:13:40.612 --> 02:13:43.346
In the past, the namesake of my father
Suleyman Shah, from shahzades...

02:13:44.479 --> 02:13:47.246
...of Seljukian, conquered this city.

02:13:48.946 --> 02:13:51.312
Here is our first capital in Anatolia.

02:13:52.146 --> 02:13:55.046
Meaning, it is a legacy
to us from our forefathers.

02:13:56.212 --> 02:13:58.946
If God permits, people from your family...

02:13:59.912 --> 02:14:03.412
...will make Muslims rule
these lands again.

02:14:04.912 --> 02:14:05.979
If God permits.

02:14:06.979 --> 02:14:08.046
If God permits.

02:14:08.879 --> 02:14:10.046
If God permits.

02:14:12.579 --> 02:14:15.912
I see that it is easy to conquer
these lands with weapon.

02:14:17.279 --> 02:14:21.112
But we need to make
these regions prosperous.

02:14:23.312 --> 02:14:26.446
We need to get welfare
for the local people here...

02:14:27.346 --> 02:14:29.246
and find solutions to their problems.

02:14:31.979 --> 02:14:35.146
We need to provide justice in
these lands again.

02:14:37.312 --> 02:14:40.912
We need to keep the nation alive
in order to keep our state alive.

02:14:45.912 --> 02:14:48.446
Do we have the chance entering these
cities you have mentioned?

02:14:49.312 --> 02:14:52.079
It is too early. You will be recognized.

02:14:54.379 --> 02:14:56.146
They must be seeking for you
everywhere anyway.

02:14:56.946 --> 02:14:59.079
The next time you come,
we will try entering the city.

02:15:00.179 --> 02:15:03.146
Next time, we will come to conquer
these cities, Turgut.

02:15:05.112 --> 02:15:07.246
If God permits, Bey. If God permits.

02:15:07.446 --> 02:15:08.612
If God permits.

02:15:24.412 --> 02:15:26.279
Halime, let me go.

02:15:27.646 --> 02:15:29.512
If you get caught, everything
will be ruined, Selcan.

02:15:31.012 --> 02:15:32.579
You can not look at Gundogdu Bey's face
again.

02:15:34.146 --> 02:15:35.846
You would lose and Aytolun will win.

02:15:36.546 --> 02:15:38.212
I will enter the marquee, do not insist.

02:16:23.646 --> 02:16:24.646
God bless you. Goodbye

02:16:39.479 --> 02:16:41.046
Aytolun Hatun wanted to see me.

02:17:12.079 --> 02:17:13.112
They brought Noyan!

02:17:13.479 --> 02:17:14.946
They brought Noyan!

02:17:15.346 --> 02:17:16.646
They brought Noyan!

02:17:17.246 --> 02:17:18.479
They brought Noyan!

02:17:22.612 --> 02:17:24.512
Bey, are you alright?

02:17:25.512 --> 02:17:27.079
I have no power left, Aytolun.

02:17:28.079 --> 02:17:30.579
I told you not to come. You are not
feeling good.

02:17:31.879 --> 02:17:33.046
You go.

02:17:34.512 --> 02:17:39.346
Go and represent our marquee
while that dishonest is being executed.

02:17:41.079 --> 02:17:43.879
I will rest a while, go along.

02:17:45.412 --> 02:17:47.512
Kaya! Help me, son.

02:18:02.112 --> 02:18:04.046
Dear God, please preserve my mind.

02:18:05.279 --> 02:18:06.446
Why is he coming back?

02:18:38.079 --> 02:18:40.646
In the midle of winter
these regions are too hot, Bey.

02:18:42.279 --> 02:18:45.112
Oh that unique weather of
Pasinler Plateau.

02:18:47.079 --> 02:18:50.079
-Bears do not like hot weather, Bey.
-May you freeze hopefully!

02:18:53.279 --> 02:18:55.046
Come along with me,
I have things to tell you.

02:19:04.012 --> 02:19:06.012
These regions are exactly like the lands
we are looking for.

02:19:07.412 --> 02:19:09.012
Byzantium lost it's power.

02:19:11.112 --> 02:19:13.846
If we succeed to move our nomad tent
to these lands...

02:19:15.112 --> 02:19:16.912
...we will be able to found the homeland
we have been dreaming of.

02:19:18.646 --> 02:19:21.946
We will have children
and keep our nation grow.

02:19:25.012 --> 02:19:28.146
Our sons and daughters will be happy.

02:19:31.546 --> 02:19:33.512
What if Beys in the nomad group
would not want to come here, Bey?

02:19:35.079 --> 02:19:36.379
We will try to persuade them.

02:19:39.146 --> 02:19:40.412
What if they still do not come, Bey?

02:19:44.379 --> 02:19:45.846
Then we will come, Dogan.

02:19:48.112 --> 02:19:49.879
We will come, Bey, we will.

02:19:50.379 --> 02:19:53.446
We will go everywhere with you, Bey.
We will even go to death, Bey!

02:19:56.479 --> 02:20:02.046
But, Bey, the next time we come here,
can we change the name of this region?

02:20:02.412 --> 02:20:03.879
I am not able to pronounce it, Bey.

02:20:04.346 --> 02:20:05.612
I thought he would say
something meaningful.

02:20:06.479 --> 02:20:09.446
Sure, we can change the name, Bamsi.

02:20:10.879 --> 02:20:11.979
Do you have any ideas?

02:20:13.479 --> 02:20:17.912
For example, Bey,
this region Bega, Belagun...

02:20:19.046 --> 02:20:21.012
Whatever it is. Tell what you want to
call it.

02:20:24.046 --> 02:20:26.112
Bel, bel... Bel, bel...

02:20:27.312 --> 02:20:28.412
Bilecuk.

02:20:29.546 --> 02:20:32.412
Bilecuk! Bilecuk, Bey!
Can not we use Bilecuk?

02:20:32.946 --> 02:20:34.112
Bilecuk!

02:20:37.012 --> 02:20:38.112
Sure, Bamsi.

02:20:38.946 --> 02:20:42.346
Can we say Bilecik instead of Bilecuk?

02:20:43.012 --> 02:20:45.279
Sure, Bey. Sure, Bey, why not?

02:20:46.012 --> 02:20:47.912
Bilecuk! Bilecuk!

02:20:48.579 --> 02:20:53.012
We will come and conquer you! Bilecuk!

02:20:53.579 --> 02:20:55.412
Shut up! Shut up you bear!

02:21:03.546 --> 02:21:05.479
Kill him! Kill him!

02:21:11.646 --> 02:21:12.979
Give his punishment!

02:21:13.479 --> 02:21:16.579
I wanted you to witness this moment!

02:21:18.546 --> 02:21:24.312
Witness that this cur of The Mongolians
is as mortal as we are!

02:21:31.112 --> 02:21:36.946
Witness that this fear of Mongolians
within the hearts of all our brothers...

02:21:37.312 --> 02:21:40.412
...from east to west will end now!

02:22:02.146 --> 02:22:03.312
What shall I do?

02:22:51.012 --> 02:22:52.079
Halime.

02:23:00.079 --> 02:23:01.179
Daughter...

02:23:02.879 --> 02:23:04.279
...what are you doing in here?

02:23:43.279 --> 02:23:44.912
May God be with you.

02:23:47.479 --> 02:23:48.612
I am Dervish Mahmut.

02:23:49.279 --> 02:23:51.112
They came here to listen the things
you have already told me.

02:23:52.846 --> 02:23:54.179
Help yourselves, sit please.

02:24:03.179 --> 02:24:05.046
Thou, sons of Prophet Adam.

02:24:06.512 --> 02:24:11.379
I invite you to a faith that people
do not transcend each other.

02:24:12.379 --> 02:24:17.179
To a religion that keeps justice and
brotherhood above everything else.

02:24:17.412 --> 02:24:20.979
How can a human be equal with another?
How will I be equal with a noble one?

02:24:26.912 --> 02:24:30.179
If God, that created human
from a blood clot,

02:24:31.346 --> 02:24:34.379
classified people,...

02:24:35.879 --> 02:24:37.246
...is not that injustice?

02:24:40.046 --> 02:24:45.346
If so, since the time we were born
we would be hard done by.

02:24:47.346 --> 02:24:50.646
God is merciful. He forgives.

02:24:52.046 --> 02:24:53.446
He shows mercy. He is fair.

02:24:54.179 --> 02:25:00.012
Meaning that, he is the one to dispenses
the justice.

02:25:01.046 --> 02:25:04.312
How can the creator
of justice do injustice

02:25:04.546 --> 02:25:07.012
to people he created and oppress them?

02:25:07.879 --> 02:25:09.879
If God would not oppress his servants

02:25:10.546 --> 02:25:13.146
why do you oppress us
with your infidelity?

02:25:28.546 --> 02:25:30.479
You are the betrayer that killed my men.

02:25:31.046 --> 02:25:33.146
And you are the commander of
those cruel ones.

02:25:42.012 --> 02:25:43.446
When it's time to battle,

02:25:45.079 --> 02:25:47.946
may God be with us,...

02:25:48.546 --> 02:25:52.479
...with the army of Sultan Alaeddin.

02:25:53.179 --> 02:25:54.412
Allahu Akbar!

02:25:55.079 --> 02:25:56.412
Allahu Akbar!

02:25:57.079 --> 02:25:58.412
Allahu Akbar!

02:25:58.946 --> 02:26:00.246
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:00.579 --> 02:26:02.112
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:02.579 --> 02:26:04.012
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:04.446 --> 02:26:05.879
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:06.379 --> 02:26:07.846
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:08.246 --> 02:26:09.546
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:10.212 --> 02:26:11.446
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:12.846 --> 02:26:14.112
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:14.479 --> 02:26:15.846
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:16.179 --> 02:26:17.446
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:18.179 --> 02:26:19.412
Allahu Akbar!

02:26:20.112 --> 02:26:21.346
Allahu Akbar!

02:28:28.579 --> 02:28:29.879
Dear Khan...

02:28:31.112 --> 02:28:32.312
...Sadettin Kobek.
