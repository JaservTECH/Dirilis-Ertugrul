00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 59 will start after 12:35 min.

12:35.241 --> 12:39.241
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:48.503 --> 12:51.969
My Steel Mountain mightier than
the sun has heard my voice.

12:53.336 --> 12:55.403
My Golden Mountain
mightier than the moon,

12:55.903 --> 12:58.936
my Ethel Tree mightier than the axe,
they all answered my call.

13:00.369 --> 13:03.336
Now, the time has come for bloodshed.

13:04.936 --> 13:08.469
Now, the sacred trees adorned with
clothes are screaming for revenge.

13:09.203 --> 13:11.603
Flames burn brighter with
the scent of your flesh.

13:13.303 --> 13:15.836
You came here to meet
your end in my hands.

13:33.936 --> 13:37.369
Did you think you would get away
with all the blood you shed, Noyan?

13:37.503 --> 13:38.969
Now is the time to pay.

13:39.103 --> 13:43.936
Let us see if Kobek, your partner
in all this will save you this time?

13:44.803 --> 13:48.436
I wanted you, Ertugrul.
And Sadettin gave you to me.

13:49.569 --> 13:52.203
I knew you would come
here to meet your own end.

13:53.269 --> 13:55.503
Let's see who leaves
here as a corpse.

13:58.069 --> 14:01.936
Since Kobek gave me to you,
come and get me then.

14:02.303 --> 14:05.203
Holy spirits will become more
powerful with your blood, Ertugrul.

14:06.069 --> 14:08.936
In the name of the spirits!
Attack, servants!

14:15.069 --> 14:16.436
God!

14:24.469 --> 14:25.936
God!

15:25.536 --> 15:26.869
What happened to you?

15:27.103 --> 15:28.469
Ertugrul's Alps.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.936
They were lying in ambush
on the road, his Ameer.

15:32.903 --> 15:33.903
Bogac?

15:34.436 --> 15:37.336
They killed everyone but
they took him, his Ameer.

15:38.369 --> 15:39.969
So they captured him alive.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.203
Ertugrul!

16:13.336 --> 16:15.603
Welcome to Noyan's hell, Ertugrul.

16:18.569 --> 16:20.969
<i>Welcome to Noyan's hell, Ertugrul.</i>

16:33.336 --> 16:34.936
Noyan!

18:52.803 --> 18:54.469
Bamsi! Wait.

18:55.069 --> 18:57.036
Ertugrul Bey should deal with Noyan.

19:07.169 --> 19:08.903
The gallant man feeds on blood, Ertugrul.

19:09.303 --> 19:11.236
You will drown in your own blood, Noyan.

19:19.103 --> 19:21.136
Did you think it would be that easy?

19:21.403 --> 19:22.903
It won't be easy.

19:24.036 --> 19:26.869
You won't pay this easily
for what you did

19:27.036 --> 19:30.936
to Gokce Hatun, Tugtekin Bey, Wild
Demir, Aykiz and the baby in her womb.

19:31.936 --> 19:33.836
This is just the beginning, Ertugrul.

19:34.336 --> 19:38.936
Do you think your little baby
will grow up and ride ponies?

19:40.436 --> 19:42.803
I will not allow that,
for as long as I am alive.

19:44.303 --> 19:49.436
Everyone in your nomad group and who
stands by you will all be dead.

20:00.069 --> 20:02.236
Why aren't the spirits
on my side?

20:20.603 --> 20:21.869
Why, Bey?

20:22.803 --> 20:24.336
Why won't you kill that bastard?

20:26.903 --> 20:30.336
Since when do you question
my orders and authority, Turgut?

21:33.751 --> 21:37.184
This fire feeds with which carcass?

21:54.618 --> 21:56.184
Dogan. Bamsi.

21:57.084 --> 21:58.251
Take where the horses are.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.084
-Tie them.
-As you wish, Bey.

22:02.251 --> 22:03.651
As you wish, Bey.

22:11.651 --> 22:13.984
You will regret you did not
kill me, Ertugrul.

23:42.984 --> 23:44.951
They were beloved lieges of God.

23:46.751 --> 23:48.118
He took their lives together.

23:48.818 --> 23:50.784
May he not deny them his mercy.

23:53.918 --> 23:54.951
Hatun...

23:55.951 --> 23:57.984
...your pain is my pain.

24:00.251 --> 24:03.718
The tears you shed are my tears.

24:04.751 --> 24:07.918
We have been through
many calamities with you.

24:08.984 --> 24:10.918
We will get through this, too,
if God permits.

24:15.218 --> 24:17.851
Gokce was a piece of my heart.

24:20.318 --> 24:25.251
She was more than my own heart,
one I raised myself...

24:26.851 --> 24:29.118
...one I was with through her
every trouble.

24:32.951 --> 24:36.118
I buried my three children
before I suckled them.

24:37.718 --> 24:39.318
And now, my sister.

24:43.051 --> 24:45.651
All we wanted was a sprinkle of peace.

24:47.084 --> 24:48.651
A sweet smile.

24:49.918 --> 24:52.618
We gave them all to black earth, Bey.

24:57.018 --> 24:58.151
Get up.

25:03.918 --> 25:04.918
Selcan.

25:06.084 --> 25:09.751
The peace we are looking for
is here, in your belly.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.751
We will see the peace we look for

25:13.851 --> 25:16.984
and those sweet smiles on our
child's face, if God permits.

25:19.984 --> 25:21.318
If God permits, Bey.

25:23.818 --> 25:24.818
Come.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.718
-May it be easy, Hatuns.
-Thank you.

26:12.084 --> 26:14.184
-May it be easy.
-Thank you, Halime Sultan.

26:21.884 --> 26:25.051
Your rags, your weaves are so beautiful,
Hatuns. May God bless your hands.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.251
Thank you.

26:26.751 --> 26:30.284
We have learned it from you to make
the blue in our rugs as the sky

26:30.518 --> 26:32.118
and the yellow as the sun, Halime Sultan.

26:32.184 --> 26:35.318
-Not at all.
-You have put so much effort in us.

26:36.951 --> 26:38.218
Thank you, Hatuns.

26:38.618 --> 26:41.851
If only the grass we fed
our animals were more lush

26:41.951 --> 26:44.618
then our wools would be
more stuffed, Halime Sultan.

26:45.918 --> 26:48.918
And the plants we dye
our rugs with are sparse.

26:48.984 --> 26:52.951
If only we had more fertile lands
and we would cheer.

26:53.818 --> 26:56.151
If God permits, we will have lands
like that, Hatuns.

26:56.751 --> 26:58.584
Their pastures vast

26:58.851 --> 27:01.951
their meadows full with plants
that will enliven our rugs.

27:02.551 --> 27:05.618
One of a kind, earth's most fertile lands.

27:05.918 --> 27:07.551
Where is it, Halime Sultan?

27:11.884 --> 27:13.918
The lands in which we will feed our flocks

27:14.218 --> 27:18.084
we will weave our rugs nicer
and sell are there.

27:21.751 --> 27:24.784
Hatuns, I am talking about
Byzantine border.

27:27.518 --> 27:30.584
The only place on earth, with wild
waters flowing from its springs

27:30.684 --> 27:34.518
where we will get grace from its
ground and booty from our enemies

27:34.651 --> 27:39.084
where we will be bigger,
stronger is there.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.751
So you kidnapped Noyan, too, Ertugrul.

29:07.851 --> 29:09.818
I will not let you reach Sultan.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.118
Summon Sungurtekin Bey to me at once!

29:16.118 --> 29:17.618
He will come to me immediately.

29:33.984 --> 29:35.684
What is Bey doing, Dogan Brother?

29:36.684 --> 29:39.884
Will he set Noyan free like Gundogdu Bey?

29:40.684 --> 29:42.584
How could that be, mountains' bear?

29:43.784 --> 29:45.051
What will he do, then?

29:46.218 --> 29:47.518
How would I know?

29:54.318 --> 29:57.718
Turgut Brother? Tell me, what will happen?

30:03.184 --> 30:07.084
I have not seen Turgut like this before.
And the look he gives to Ertugrul Bey.

30:07.984 --> 30:09.518
May God render our end well.

31:07.318 --> 31:08.518
Why, Bey?

31:11.018 --> 31:12.018
Why?

31:14.584 --> 31:16.218
What will you do with these ignobles?

31:17.051 --> 31:18.318
What is it you want to do?

31:19.018 --> 31:21.084
How many more lives he must take

31:21.218 --> 31:24.718
like Tugtekin Bey and Gokce Hatun
for you to kill him?

31:25.184 --> 31:30.918
Is this how you will avenge Aykiz,
Wild Demir, all the lives we lost?

31:32.118 --> 31:34.618
Do you think everyone is
as manly as you are, Turgut?

31:35.718 --> 31:39.918
That is why I say, they must die, Bey.
That is why I say, take their lives.

31:40.218 --> 31:45.184
If we kill them, it means we have lost
the battle we carried until now.

31:46.118 --> 31:48.951
It means all that blood shed
will not be brought to books.

31:49.651 --> 31:52.051
I do not his carrion, I need him alive.

31:53.518 --> 31:54.918
Hold your rage, Turgut.

31:55.218 --> 31:59.184
If we do not make him pay for
all this blood, then who will, Bey?

32:02.918 --> 32:05.951
I want them to appear before
Sultan Aleaddin along with Yigit.

32:06.018 --> 32:07.251
Do you still not see?

32:08.318 --> 32:11.118
I do not, Bey. I do not.

32:12.251 --> 32:15.684
I have had enough. I have had
enough of all these games.

32:16.118 --> 32:17.284
Enough!

32:19.551 --> 32:20.551
Turgut!

32:22.284 --> 32:25.718
I do not want to see a weak,
desperate Alp before me.

32:29.651 --> 32:34.518
What kept me standing all this time
was the vengeance within me, Bey.

32:35.884 --> 32:37.518
You took it away from me.

32:38.284 --> 32:41.051
Since you do not want to see
a desperate Alp before you

32:41.851 --> 32:43.851
then I shall go on my way.

32:57.618 --> 32:58.651
Bey.

32:59.518 --> 33:00.851
Get on your horse, Bamsi.

33:07.184 --> 33:09.584
You cannot even look out
for your Alps, Ertugrul.

33:12.218 --> 33:13.984
Shut up, wounded boy.

33:15.251 --> 33:16.284
We are leaving.

34:03.018 --> 34:04.084
Halime.

34:05.184 --> 34:06.251
Selcan.

34:07.251 --> 34:10.818
What do you tell the nomad tent's women
with your silver tongue?

34:12.084 --> 34:14.151
Please, tell me, too.

34:17.251 --> 34:21.784
I say there are always better,
more fertile lands, Selcan.

34:23.684 --> 34:25.584
Are you saying it for migration?

34:27.751 --> 34:30.518
Gundogdu Bey, Sungur Bey...

34:32.284 --> 34:37.684
...many Beys of Kayi tribe, Dodurga tribe
do you not know what they want?

34:39.618 --> 34:43.118
Would not what you say
separate us from each other?

34:43.751 --> 34:46.684
Would there ever be separation
between us, Selcan?

34:47.518 --> 34:49.018
You are my sister.

34:50.851 --> 34:53.218
Who else do I have in this world
other than you?

34:53.918 --> 34:54.984
Halime.

34:56.684 --> 34:58.218
I lost Gokce.

34:59.918 --> 35:02.118
What would I do if I lose you, too?

35:03.151 --> 35:08.051
I beg you, talk to Ertugrul Bey,
convince him.

35:16.251 --> 35:20.851
I left Gunduz with Banu Cicek, Selcan.
I should go to the marquee.

35:34.951 --> 35:35.951
Selcan.

35:37.984 --> 35:39.184
What is happening, child?

35:41.751 --> 35:42.818
Halime.

35:44.684 --> 35:48.151
She tells about the fertile lands
she will migrate to

35:48.551 --> 35:51.651
to the women, Hatuns of nomad group.

35:54.784 --> 35:57.851
Mother. Please.

35:58.784 --> 36:03.018
These mean separation.
Do not allow separation.

36:04.718 --> 36:08.651
I beg you, mother.
Do not let them leave us.

36:09.718 --> 36:11.151
Stop them.

36:12.984 --> 36:14.117
Stop.

36:23.284 --> 36:25.218
Ertugrul.

36:26.884 --> 36:29.051
What are you after again?

36:36.751 --> 36:39.984
Our Bey's and his wife's blood
is left unavenged.

36:40.184 --> 36:43.718
And migration is at the door.
We do not know what to do, Bey.

36:44.284 --> 36:47.751
Our duty is to not leave our
nomad group without a leader, first.

36:47.951 --> 36:51.051
We can only find a solution
for migration like that.

36:51.851 --> 36:55.751
And we will avenge Bey's and his wife's
blood, with God's allowance.

36:56.318 --> 37:00.918
These ignobles will pay for what
they did, one by one, if God permits.

37:01.918 --> 37:04.218
Artuk Bey is right.
Everything has its time.

37:04.584 --> 37:08.551
As long as there is a wise Bey as
yourself, we will surmount this, too.

37:09.284 --> 37:10.518
Thank you.

37:18.984 --> 37:22.518
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, Akca Bey.

37:23.184 --> 37:25.784
I see you do not leave
our marquee empty, Artuk Bey.

37:36.018 --> 37:38.651
Our marquee is the heart of Dodurga,
Akca Bey.

37:39.018 --> 37:42.218
It will always overflow with
fresh blood, with God's help.

37:43.618 --> 37:46.751
I see the ardor for seignory
bestirs everyone's heart.

37:47.084 --> 37:49.584
Seignory is not a position
of ambition, Akca Bey.

37:49.818 --> 37:54.084
Seignory is a heavy burden God Almighty
bestowed upon mankind.

37:56.684 --> 37:58.151
It is time to gather
the headquarters immediately

37:58.284 --> 38:01.118
and choose the brave man that
will go under that burden.

38:01.251 --> 38:02.784
It is time, Bey. It has come.

38:02.851 --> 38:05.284
-It is true. It is time.
-Time has come.

38:06.984 --> 38:09.551
Our headquarters is all our destiny,
Akca Bey.

38:09.818 --> 38:12.318
Let the ones who seek to be Bey,
be clear tomorrow.

38:12.684 --> 38:16.018
So we can solve this matter erewhile.

38:16.251 --> 38:18.184
Our nomad group shall not be left
without a leader.

38:18.751 --> 38:21.718
-May the best happen.
-May the best happen.

38:32.784 --> 38:35.751
Beys, let us set off immediately.
Ameer Sadettin is waiting for us.

38:49.151 --> 38:50.151
Selcan!

38:51.084 --> 38:52.218
Selcan!

39:24.518 --> 39:28.284
What is it, Hatun? Dark winds
are blowing inside you again.

39:29.684 --> 39:32.518
When did dark winds ever
leave upon our heads, Bey?

39:39.818 --> 39:42.218
However, as long as you are with me

39:42.884 --> 39:45.518
no one can shatter the marquee
of my heart.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.084
Do not worry.

39:52.884 --> 39:56.184
Tell me, now. Who broke your heart?

40:02.218 --> 40:04.184
I saw her as my sister.

40:05.018 --> 40:09.518
I said, I have no other sister
after Gokce but her.

40:10.551 --> 40:13.651
But she will leave me alone, too.

40:14.584 --> 40:16.018
Who are you talking about, Hatun?

40:17.584 --> 40:20.318
Were we not the branches
of the same tree, Bey?

40:21.184 --> 40:23.618
Tell me, Hatun. Who are you talking about?

40:25.884 --> 40:27.051
Halime Sultan.

40:30.684 --> 40:36.151
She tells women about the fertile lands
she will migrate to, at the rug workshop.

40:39.751 --> 40:41.184
I told my mother, too.

40:43.984 --> 40:46.051
Stop it, Bey.

40:46.951 --> 40:48.751
Do not allow it.

40:49.918 --> 40:53.184
Did we not go through many
long winters and reach spring?

40:55.518 --> 40:58.084
Do not let them separate us
from each other.

40:59.718 --> 41:03.251
Wherever we will go,
let us go together, please.

41:28.984 --> 41:30.018
Halime!

41:34.318 --> 41:36.551
Is what Selcan said true?

41:37.518 --> 41:38.584
It is, mother.

41:43.118 --> 41:46.718
When our nomad group
is in all this trouble

41:47.218 --> 41:49.718
when we are mourning for the ones we lost

41:49.818 --> 41:52.951
when it is not certain what
will happen to your brother

41:53.051 --> 41:58.618
when it is not certain how will your man,
Ertugrul get rid of Ameer Sadettin

41:59.084 --> 42:00.951
are you attempting to do these?

42:01.951 --> 42:04.818
Mother, I know what I said.
Yet as you know...

42:04.884 --> 42:06.218
I know, of course.

42:08.084 --> 42:11.551
I know. You do not act like a Bey's wife.

42:12.218 --> 42:14.884
What does it mean to beguile women?

42:16.518 --> 42:19.284
Mother, is my duty not going on
my husband's path?

42:20.018 --> 42:21.784
If Suleyman Shah was alive

42:21.884 --> 42:25.118
would you leave him alone
on the range he will reach?

42:25.184 --> 42:28.251
Of course, I would not. I would not.

42:29.318 --> 42:33.784
But you cannot meddle with
nomad group's matters.

42:35.518 --> 42:37.851
I am a Bey's woman.

42:38.584 --> 42:41.718
Even a leaf would not move
without me knowing it.

42:44.684 --> 42:46.051
Look, Halime Sultan.

42:46.984 --> 42:49.018
I will not allow anyone

42:49.251 --> 42:55.651
to tear Suleyman Shah's
nomad group in pieces.

42:57.851 --> 42:59.718
And you shall know it.

43:21.184 --> 43:25.984
You did not fall prey to blind pharaohs'
cravings at this young age, Shahzada.

43:26.884 --> 43:30.518
You proved you are as trustworthy as
your kin and as brave as your name.

43:32.018 --> 43:35.651
You should know,
you not coveting to sedition

43:35.718 --> 43:38.318
is one of greatest deeds
in the presence of God.

43:39.051 --> 43:40.818
May God keep your path bright.

43:58.718 --> 44:00.018
Ertugrul.

44:31.184 --> 44:32.518
Yigit!

44:33.151 --> 44:34.284
Yigit.

44:35.084 --> 44:39.084
Would you believe? Look at little Sultan.
He does not fit oceans.

45:08.918 --> 45:10.618
Dogan. Bamsi.

45:11.684 --> 45:13.951
-Tie them up thoroughly.
-As you wish, Bey.

45:36.918 --> 45:40.918
You have came to the end of another duty
drawn in your fate, Ertugrul Bey.

45:42.784 --> 45:46.584
You will sow this cloth of mission
woven with many secrets, many pains

45:46.751 --> 45:49.618
into a caftan of taintless hope.

45:50.518 --> 45:54.584
You should know, in this twilight
we fell into

45:55.584 --> 45:57.651
you will be the dawn of Islam.

45:57.718 --> 45:58.951
If God permits.

45:59.218 --> 46:02.084
The ones of your own blood
will oppose you.

46:02.918 --> 46:05.984
Do not hesitate and sink into despair.

46:07.718 --> 46:08.918
Do not forget...

46:09.951 --> 46:13.584
...God would not leave the ones who
fights the holy wars on his path alone.

46:15.184 --> 46:17.518
You have been a remedy in many dark times.

46:18.018 --> 46:21.518
You have shared my trouble, and have
been the light on my path. Thank you.

46:23.318 --> 46:24.551
Come on.

46:26.551 --> 46:28.984
You shall know you will always be
in my prayers.

46:30.718 --> 46:33.118
May God keep your path bright,
Ertugrul Bey.

46:54.251 --> 46:56.918
What are the five conditions
of shooting arrows?

46:57.684 --> 47:03.651
Bow, string, arrow, thumb ring, master.

47:05.251 --> 47:08.984
What would a master know in a good arrow?

47:09.284 --> 47:14.018
Wood, horn, glue, sinew.

47:17.684 --> 47:20.084
Whether you pull the bow from your eyes

47:20.284 --> 47:25.218
from your mustache or from your chest

47:25.318 --> 47:28.284
you will never forget two things.

47:28.984 --> 47:31.918
-What were they?
-Devotion and patience.

47:32.784 --> 47:35.751
-Good.
-Why devotion, Sungurtekin Bey?

47:37.084 --> 47:40.018
What is the most beautiful path

47:40.151 --> 47:44.718
that makes mankind reach to
God Almighty, and attain his love?

47:45.018 --> 47:47.851
-Devotion, Bey.
-Devotion.

47:49.118 --> 47:52.684
Just as devotion is fearing God Almighty

47:52.918 --> 47:57.284
and keeping our hands off and getting
away from the things he forbade

47:57.918 --> 48:02.618
an archer's devotion is keeping
his hand, his eyes, his heart away

48:02.851 --> 48:07.651
from whatever it is preventing him
from reaching his target.

48:09.151 --> 48:10.184
What are these?

48:10.618 --> 48:14.684
Wind, humidity, misgiving, apprehension.

48:20.251 --> 48:23.218
Never forget. Devotion is patience.

48:23.684 --> 48:25.818
Patience is the nature of the archer.

48:27.918 --> 48:29.318
Bows on eye level!

48:32.851 --> 48:35.551
-With the name of God!
-God, grant me!

48:53.084 --> 48:54.318
What is it, brother?

48:54.584 --> 48:57.084
Ertugrul is really out of his way,
brother.

48:57.984 --> 49:02.884
He rebels against Sultan's edict outside
and against Bey's words inside.

49:03.151 --> 49:04.284
What are you saying, brother?

49:05.518 --> 49:09.984
Halime Sultan speaks with
Alp's women, with their sisters.

49:10.618 --> 49:13.718
She calls them to be a martyr
on Ertugrul's way.

49:16.184 --> 49:18.318
We need to find and stop him, brother.

49:19.551 --> 49:22.518
Brother, you have been gone for long.

49:23.018 --> 49:25.651
You do not know how stubborn Ertugrul is.

49:26.084 --> 49:29.618
He would reach his destination with
his hands if you tie his feet

49:29.718 --> 49:32.151
with his teeth if you tie his hands.

49:33.118 --> 49:36.551
He will go. He will go to that
accursed Byzantine border.

49:37.284 --> 49:39.318
And he will ruin this nomad tent

49:39.618 --> 49:41.318
reminiscence of his father
when he leaves.

49:42.318 --> 49:46.518
We must find where he hides.
There is no other way to stop him.

50:07.518 --> 50:08.918
Is there something you know, brother?

50:11.851 --> 50:13.051
I do not know, brother.

50:13.851 --> 50:15.151
I do not know anything anymore.

50:15.951 --> 50:17.951
Brother, tell me if you know.

50:18.551 --> 50:21.951
I will go and settle this myself
without getting anyone involved.

50:23.518 --> 50:25.818
After I surrender Shahzada to Sultan

50:26.218 --> 50:29.318
no one can call neither my mother
nor Ertugrul to account.

50:33.184 --> 50:37.684
Brother, if someone can solve this matter
without blood, that is me.

50:38.784 --> 50:43.884
Tell me, if you know where he is,
for Ertugrul, for Halime Sultan

50:43.984 --> 50:47.284
for their little baby in the cradle.

50:58.818 --> 51:00.051
Look, Akca Bey.

51:01.218 --> 51:03.984
Artuk Bey's closeness
with Ertugrul is apparent.

51:04.651 --> 51:07.984
What worries me, he will stand
for seignory tomorrow

51:08.118 --> 51:10.284
and be the head of Dodurga.

51:11.551 --> 51:13.884
If Artuk Bey becomes the head of Dodurga

51:14.751 --> 51:17.918
I am worried he will participate
in Ertugrul's adventures.

51:20.151 --> 51:22.084
Do not worry, Ameer Sadettin.

51:22.518 --> 51:25.951
We will not lose our nomad tent
as casualty of anyone's adventures.

51:27.918 --> 51:29.551
You must do what is needed, Beys.

51:30.284 --> 51:32.251
If you do not stop it

51:33.118 --> 51:36.184
your nomad group will be in calamity.

51:41.118 --> 51:45.884
Akca Bey, there is a matter I will speak
with you about. Beys are done here.

52:00.918 --> 52:02.118
You are a brave Bey.

52:04.018 --> 52:07.784
And you think about your nomad group.
I see it.

52:09.318 --> 52:13.818
And you are worthy of being
the Bey of Dodurga. I know.

52:26.184 --> 52:30.218
Like the late Korkut Bey,
like his son, brave Tugtekin

52:30.818 --> 52:34.251
you will be an honorable Bey for Dodurga.

52:45.784 --> 52:49.651
These gold will help you

52:49.718 --> 52:52.851
open the sealed eyes of Beys
who lost their insight.

52:55.818 --> 52:59.784
Thank you, his Ameer.
May God grant you to us.

53:00.884 --> 53:04.851
They will learn, no one, no nomad group

53:05.284 --> 53:08.751
can choose a Bey without my permission

53:08.951 --> 53:11.651
nor migrate to wherever they like.

53:12.251 --> 53:16.918
Who rebels against your might
will find us before him, his Ameer.

53:26.084 --> 53:28.784
You will tell Sultan Aleaddin
everything when we reach him.

53:29.651 --> 53:31.518
To save you from Kobek?

53:33.151 --> 53:37.217
I would rather bite my tongue
and cut it off than to do that.

54:06.551 --> 54:08.818
Bey, what will happen to Turgut Brother?

54:17.884 --> 54:20.651
Was Turgut not the one who said,
your path is our path, Dogan?

54:21.151 --> 54:22.784
When I said, this path
is the oath of ordeal

54:22.884 --> 54:24.951
not everyone can reach the target...

54:26.684 --> 54:30.651
...was he not the one who said, we
can die for you if necessary, Bamsi?

54:32.084 --> 54:36.218
I ask you. It is time for him
to draw his path.

54:36.984 --> 54:41.118
We will all see, if he will draw his path
with his anger that preys on his mind

54:41.718 --> 54:44.784
that weakens him or with his Bey's words.

54:46.718 --> 54:50.818
On this path that is thinner than hair,
sharper than sword, revenge is important.

54:51.784 --> 54:55.184
Yet, mind is more important.

55:00.718 --> 55:02.951
Noyan tormented me the most.

55:04.051 --> 55:09.851
However, this is not a matter of revenge,
it is a matter of continuity of state.

55:10.718 --> 55:13.251
If we cannot take this ignoble
to Sultan Aleaddin

55:13.718 --> 55:16.518
Kobek will do the greatest harm to state.

55:17.818 --> 55:21.718
-Did you understand?
-Yes, Bey. Understood clearly.

55:30.251 --> 55:31.618
Look at me, Bogac.

55:32.651 --> 55:34.884
You will keep your mouth shut, alright?

55:35.284 --> 55:40.118
If you want to get rid of here,
you will wait for Kobek to come.

55:41.151 --> 55:42.284
Do you understand?

55:43.651 --> 55:44.684
I do.

56:06.784 --> 56:09.018
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

56:09.151 --> 56:10.751
-And peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

56:16.518 --> 56:20.718
-You have what you wanted, Bey.
-Not yet, Artuk Bey. Not yet.

56:21.851 --> 56:23.151
How are things at the nomad tent?

56:23.518 --> 56:25.818
Dodurgas will have the headquarters
tomorrow, Bey.

56:29.518 --> 56:31.584
You will be Dodurga's Bey, Artuk Bey.

56:32.718 --> 56:36.551
If you become Bey, we will be stronger
on the Byzantine border.

56:38.618 --> 56:40.018
As you wish, Bey.

56:40.918 --> 56:44.218
Go to nomad tent immediately.
Do not tell anyone what you saw here.

56:45.018 --> 56:48.551
-I will come to nomad tent, too.
-Alright, Bey.

56:56.218 --> 56:57.518
Yigit.

57:00.018 --> 57:01.051
Yes, Bey.

57:02.018 --> 57:04.118
We will set off with these
ignobles tomorrow.

57:04.751 --> 57:07.851
We will reach to Sultan Aleaddin.
We will explain the situation.

57:08.218 --> 57:11.018
-Halime Sultan will come with us, too.
-As you wish, Bey.

59:17.618 --> 59:18.784
Aykiz.

59:21.684 --> 59:23.018
She walked tall.

59:26.084 --> 59:28.251
With long black hair
that fell to her feet.

59:29.284 --> 59:32.584
With eyebrows tightened like a bow.

59:33.784 --> 59:36.584
With a mouth too small for almond.

59:38.218 --> 59:41.684
With red cheeks like the apple of autumn.

59:45.551 --> 59:49.251
How will you arise and reach me
from where you went?

59:51.051 --> 59:54.151
I am the one who fell to your infinity...

59:56.018 --> 59:59.284
...and who waits for death on your path.

01:00:06.684 --> 01:00:08.184
Forgive me, father.

01:00:10.618 --> 01:00:13.218
I could not keep the promise I made.

01:00:16.318 --> 01:00:18.918
I could not abide Bey's doings.

01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:25.551
I could not make him pay...

01:00:27.084 --> 01:00:31.651
...that ignoble who took you
and Aykiz from me.

01:00:35.018 --> 01:00:37.584
Every breath I take is a burden,
Demir Father.

01:00:40.018 --> 01:00:45.084
It would not befit me to walk on the paths
Aykiz's boot has not touched, father.

01:00:46.784 --> 01:00:49.618
The anvil your hand does not touch

01:00:50.151 --> 01:00:53.084
your shop that your hearth does not
fume is forbidden to me.

01:00:58.251 --> 01:01:00.584
I cannot fit to these lands anymore.

01:01:02.584 --> 01:01:04.784
My nomad tent is forbidden to me, father.

01:01:08.018 --> 01:01:09.884
Forgive me, father.

01:01:10.818 --> 01:01:14.118
Forgive me, father!

01:01:15.751 --> 01:01:17.218
Forgive me!

01:01:17.818 --> 01:01:19.651
Forgive me, father!

01:01:21.284 --> 01:01:22.751
Forgive me.

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.247
Tell me.

01:01:46.147 --> 01:01:50.480
What did you do that makes you frown
like in your childhood?

01:01:58.213 --> 01:02:01.247
My brother, Ertugrul preys on our mind.

01:02:02.913 --> 01:02:05.313
They say, "Each tree creates
its own mite."

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.413
They were right, mother.

01:02:10.047 --> 01:02:12.613
He slowly carves our marquee.

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:17.447
Ertugrul will shatter my father's trust
upon our heads, mother.

01:02:18.447 --> 01:02:20.413
It is time to say stop.

01:02:23.613 --> 01:02:26.013
Tell me what is on your tongue.

01:02:27.647 --> 01:02:29.980
The path Ertugrul follows
is not right, mother.

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:33.280
And Halime Sultan, in his absence...

01:02:36.947 --> 01:02:40.513
The range he will reach will divide
into two our nomad group.

01:02:42.447 --> 01:02:46.913
I say, is it not the time to gather
the headquarters immediately?

01:02:53.847 --> 01:02:56.247
Do you think this nomad group
does not have a head?

01:02:58.847 --> 01:03:03.980
Who are you to dare to come
before me and say these?

01:03:08.147 --> 01:03:10.480
How quickly you forgot
who is the head of Kayi.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.047
Mother. If it continues like this

01:03:16.313 --> 01:03:19.080
Ertugrul will not only
divide the nomad group

01:03:19.913 --> 01:03:22.113
but he will also shed the blood
of someone from us.

01:03:24.947 --> 01:03:29.847
If that happens, Ertugrul will not be
my son any longer.

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:32.280
And he will not find a place
in this nomad group.

01:03:32.613 --> 01:03:34.347
You should get it through your heads.

01:04:53.547 --> 01:04:54.847
Aykiz.

01:04:58.513 --> 01:04:59.880
Aykiz.

01:05:04.547 --> 01:05:06.547
My mother has a weakness for Ertugrul.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.013
It was like this yesterday,
and today, too.

01:05:10.013 --> 01:05:12.180
I say, blood will be shed
if it continues like this

01:05:12.347 --> 01:05:16.047
she keeps silent, still waits for
Ertugrul to do what he will.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:18.613
Then, what is necessary will be done.

01:05:19.647 --> 01:05:21.547
This marquee that is my father's trust

01:05:22.247 --> 01:05:25.980
is too precious to hand in to
Ertugrul's blind fancies.

01:05:27.913 --> 01:05:31.347
-I will tell him to stop no matter what.
-How will we do that, brother?

01:05:40.513 --> 01:05:42.247
What is Turgut doing here?

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.880
Then where is Ertugrul?

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.413
Let us go and sound him out.

01:06:11.247 --> 01:06:14.013
Once, when Wild Demir was making
this weapon you carry...

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:18.913
...he said, "This thing is forged
with love, not rage."

01:06:31.113 --> 01:06:32.447
And again, he said

01:06:33.347 --> 01:06:36.580
"If you will release your anger,
do not use the iron

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.413
do it by reaping the enemy
with what the iron forged."

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:48.513
It is not clear who is friend
and who is enemy, anymore, Bey.

01:06:49.347 --> 01:06:52.280
Sometimes enemy is right
beside us, Turgut Alp.

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.513
And sometimes, right within us.

01:06:55.647 --> 01:07:01.080
Our rage blinds us, deafens us. And
we do not hear the cries of the enemy.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:06.480
Their obstinacy, their rage
blunts them so much

01:07:06.647 --> 01:07:10.380
that they do not see they have become
enemies of their the most loved ones.

01:07:13.047 --> 01:07:16.013
These are the times we are blind
to anyone but ourselves, Bey.

01:07:17.047 --> 01:07:21.080
We wallow in our darkness
and then drown in it.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:28.047
We hold the ignobles we took an oath
to avenge like pigeons in our hands

01:07:28.513 --> 01:07:30.880
and wait for them to bite us like a snake.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.913
The ones who killed Aykiz

01:07:37.147 --> 01:07:41.247
Wild Demir, Gokce Hatun, Tugtekin Bey...

01:07:43.347 --> 01:07:45.980
...have now became pigeons
in Ertugrul Bey's hands.

01:07:53.547 --> 01:07:55.880
I cannot live in these lands anymore.

01:07:57.947 --> 01:08:00.413
It is time everyone goes on their own way.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:24.080
Apparently, some problem occurred
between him and Ertugrul.

01:08:24.347 --> 01:08:26.347
Ertugrul is after some games again.

01:08:27.847 --> 01:08:30.313
Each game of his games
turn around and hit us.

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.213
We must find Ertugrul hastily, brother.

01:08:35.347 --> 01:08:37.513
Ertugrul must be
in the Geyikli cave, Sungur.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:42.180
Go and tell him to stop, immediately.
And surrender Shahzada Yigit to Sultan.

01:08:42.913 --> 01:08:45.547
And I will do all I can
to become the Bey here.

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.647
Where is this cave, brother?

01:08:48.013 --> 01:08:50.847
On the east of Kirac Hill,
at the end of the valley.

01:08:51.147 --> 01:08:53.113
Follow the pathway,
it will take you there.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:09.180
Sungurtekin Bey, Ameer Sadettin
is expecting you at his place.

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.580
Go, at once. Let us find out what is
Ameer Sadettin's bother?

01:09:31.313 --> 01:09:34.513
And do not trust him much,
do not tell him where Ertugrul is.

01:09:35.047 --> 01:09:37.247
I do not care about
Ameer Sadettin, brother.

01:09:37.413 --> 01:09:39.613
All I care about is there being
no fight for throne

01:09:39.913 --> 01:09:41.913
between Sultan Aleaddin and Shahzada.

01:09:42.313 --> 01:09:44.980
We can hardly find a ruler
like Sultan Aleaddin again.

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.447
Alright, go on.

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.247
<i>Is there permission, Halime Sultan?</i>

01:11:21.613 --> 01:11:23.147
Come in, Banu Cicek.

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.147
Come.

01:11:28.313 --> 01:11:30.013
What is it? Did something happen?

01:11:32.647 --> 01:11:37.147
I saw one of Ameer Sadettin's soldiers
with Sungurtekin Bey.

01:11:37.447 --> 01:11:39.280
The soldier said some things and left.

01:11:39.947 --> 01:11:42.480
Then Sungurtekin Bey left in haste.

01:11:44.047 --> 01:11:46.113
He left the nomad tent as soon as
he got on his horse.

01:11:46.513 --> 01:11:50.647
Halime Sultan, apparently Sungurtekin Bey
is going to that ignoble.

01:12:42.413 --> 01:12:43.880
Peace be upon you.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.080
And peace be upon you.

01:12:55.513 --> 01:12:58.513
My horse's nail fell. I want you
to look at it, blacksmith.

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:05.980
I am not a blacksmith.

01:13:08.147 --> 01:13:09.947
But I will still take a look.

01:13:11.413 --> 01:13:12.547
Thank you.

01:13:23.847 --> 01:13:25.113
It needs a new one.

01:13:28.213 --> 01:13:29.347
Thank you, brother.

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.613
I could not know what to call you.

01:13:34.147 --> 01:13:36.313
-Bestow your name.
-Turgut Alp.

01:13:38.613 --> 01:13:40.847
I have always heard of Ertugrul Bey.

01:13:42.213 --> 01:13:43.513
So you are his Alp.

01:13:46.347 --> 01:13:51.313
You must have devoted yourself to this
labor out of boredom, after Mongols left.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.880
My name is Doruk Bey.

01:13:59.047 --> 01:14:01.213
My nomad group moved to Byzantine border.

01:14:04.347 --> 01:14:06.280
So you are going to Byzantine borders?

01:14:07.047 --> 01:14:08.147
Yes.

01:14:09.313 --> 01:14:11.947
I came here to buy Arabian horses
for my nomad group.

01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:16.080
And now I am returning.
Is Ertugrul Bey in the nomad tent?

01:14:22.547 --> 01:14:26.547
A brave man like him surely would not
wander at the nomad tent.

01:14:27.147 --> 01:14:30.280
He must be on duty with his Alps.
And you are here.

01:14:40.013 --> 01:14:43.513
I will do its work, then you can come
and get your horse.

01:14:47.547 --> 01:14:49.413
However you wish, Turgut Alp.

01:14:51.847 --> 01:14:53.147
I will stay here tonight.

01:14:54.347 --> 01:14:56.180
I will take my horse when I leave.

01:14:59.947 --> 01:15:01.380
It is not necessary.

01:15:04.947 --> 01:15:06.447
Thank you, Turgut Alp.

01:15:08.947 --> 01:15:10.280
Give your blessings.

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:13.313
I do.

01:15:26.247 --> 01:15:27.480
Gunduz.

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:34.513
Know, you will not live the life of
an exile like your mother and your uncle.

01:15:37.147 --> 01:15:39.580
You will live under the shadow of
the sycamore your father will plant

01:15:39.847 --> 01:15:41.447
with your head held high.

01:15:43.447 --> 01:15:48.347
With people of your own blood and
at your own home, if God permits.

01:15:55.113 --> 01:15:56.313
Mother.

01:16:00.247 --> 01:16:04.380
Mother, if I said a wrong thing
and hurt you, forgive me.

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:12.480
Our children are such a beauty
God gives us...

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:15.847
...they are unique.

01:16:19.247 --> 01:16:23.347
These are the best times of Gunduz,
savor it.

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:27.380
Yet, when Gunduz grows up

01:16:28.113 --> 01:16:33.647
someday, you, too will carry the burden
my four lion hearted sons gave me.

01:16:35.047 --> 01:16:38.880
You will struggle over
to keep them together

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:45.313
to see them happy, to always have them
with you on your meals.

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:47.613
Mother.

01:16:51.513 --> 01:16:56.313
And once you have another child,
when there is discord among them

01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:01.180
remember my words.
Then you will understand me.

01:17:03.347 --> 01:17:08.980
A mother's toughest duty is to remove
the duality among her children.

01:17:11.347 --> 01:17:12.580
Do you understand me?

01:17:15.313 --> 01:17:17.247
Do not forget my words.

01:17:18.613 --> 01:17:24.047
Even if Ertugrul wants separation,
you will tell him to stop.

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:31.880
Apparently, Turgut Brother
is in wrong, Bamsi.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.047
Bey's intention is to unravel
Kobek's cunnings.

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:38.480
Yes.

01:18:40.047 --> 01:18:43.880
Let us say, Turgut Brother made
a great blunder, did we not, brother?

01:18:45.147 --> 01:18:47.313
Did we not repine to our Bey from within?

01:18:47.947 --> 01:18:52.113
Did we not douse our insides
to mud with manifold misgivings?

01:18:56.113 --> 01:18:59.880
Alright, but brother, what is leaving
your Bey and walking away?

01:19:00.247 --> 01:19:02.247
Did we not resent our Bey

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:05.013
because he did not tell Turgut not to go
when he was leaving, brother?

01:19:06.947 --> 01:19:08.247
What are you saying, brother?

01:19:09.213 --> 01:19:15.480
Brother, I am saying, let us look for
mistakes and sins inside us, first.

01:19:16.513 --> 01:19:18.647
Turgut Brother fell into negligence.

01:19:19.313 --> 01:19:21.980
He did but what we did, brother?

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:03.413
Is there permission, Bey?

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.513
Bey.

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.080
Is there permission?

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:14.613
Sit.

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:35.080
Turgut Alp made a mistake, Bey.

01:20:36.913 --> 01:20:39.613
And we made two mistakes, Bey.

01:20:41.913 --> 01:20:43.880
He fell into negligence, too, Bey.

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:49.313
And we fell into negligence twice,
thinking about what our Bey did, Bey.

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:51.580
Forgive him, Bey.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.047
Not only him, forgive us, too.

01:20:55.847 --> 01:20:58.413
We resented your decision.
We made a mistake.

01:21:03.213 --> 01:21:05.180
Did I not tell you this was a long path...

01:21:06.913 --> 01:21:08.513
...before we set off on this path?

01:21:11.147 --> 01:21:13.347
-You did, Bey.
-You did, Bey.

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.413
This path is woven with many pains,
many troubles?

01:21:19.413 --> 01:21:22.113
-You told, Bey.
-You told.

01:21:22.613 --> 01:21:25.547
Did I not say, in the battle arena
you are only as gallant as your sword...

01:21:26.247 --> 01:21:28.213
...where your swords cannot reach

01:21:28.513 --> 01:21:33.047
you will be defeated by your weaknesses
and you lose the battle?

01:21:33.947 --> 01:21:36.480
-You did, Bey.
-You did, Bey.

01:21:40.547 --> 01:21:46.180
Now, I am asking, are you sure
to walk on this path with me?

01:21:48.947 --> 01:21:50.980
We were raw when we got on this path, Bey.

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.913
But now, we understood,
we are not experienced enough.

01:21:54.447 --> 01:21:57.980
To be burnt like you, Bey,
has not been destined to us yet.

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:00.047
Forgive us, Bey.

01:22:01.113 --> 01:22:04.213
We will set our hearts to burn as you
on this path, Bey, you should know.

01:22:12.913 --> 01:22:14.280
And about Turgut...

01:22:16.847 --> 01:22:19.480
He will get experienced on his own path
like all brave men.

01:22:22.513 --> 01:22:24.180
May God keep his path bright.

01:22:28.313 --> 01:22:29.347
Amen, Bey.

01:22:30.247 --> 01:22:31.480
Amen, Bey.

01:22:41.247 --> 01:22:44.180
We will take Halime Sultan and
set off in the morning. Be ready.

01:22:45.347 --> 01:22:47.380
-As you wish, Bey.
-As you wish, Bey.

01:23:16.247 --> 01:23:19.547
I believed in you. I trusted you.

01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:21.547
And what happened?

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.113
Nothing. A big nothing.

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:29.547
You could not even bring news
from Shahzada or Ertugrul.

01:23:30.913 --> 01:23:36.180
I did whatever I did for our state,
for Sultan Aleaddin.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:40.380
I will solve this myself, Sungurtekin Bey.
You should know.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.613
Will you confront my brother, Ertugrul
with your soldiers, his Ameer?

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.213
If need be, yes.

01:23:57.847 --> 01:24:02.047
Tell me, Sungurtekin Bey, what would
you do if you were in my shoes?

01:24:04.113 --> 01:24:08.013
Did Hayme Hatun come to my door say
"I will surrender my son

01:24:08.147 --> 01:24:12.480
to Sultan Aleaddin, myself,
if necessary."? She did.

01:24:12.913 --> 01:24:14.047
You!

01:24:14.347 --> 01:24:21.113
Did you, yourself tell me you will
deal with this matter? You did.

01:24:22.347 --> 01:24:25.213
Did I move a finger? No.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.947
Why?

01:24:28.847 --> 01:24:31.380
Out of my respect to Kayi Beys

01:24:31.513 --> 01:24:35.213
whom I have no doubt
on their honor, their word.

01:24:36.213 --> 01:24:39.247
I did not set my soldiers
on the nomad tent. Why?

01:24:40.547 --> 01:24:42.647
For not to shed brother blood.

01:24:43.613 --> 01:24:48.613
So Kayis, who fought like lions
against Mongols would not get hurt.

01:24:50.013 --> 01:24:52.947
Do you not see it either? Tell me.

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:58.980
Do you not know what would happen to me

01:25:00.013 --> 01:25:02.580
if I cannot solve this matter
before Sultan Aleaddin comes?

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.380
How would I answer him?

01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.013
I know where Ertugrul is.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.347
Is that so? How do you know it?

01:25:20.547 --> 01:25:21.647
I found out.

01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:29.613
Tell me, Sungurtekin Bey. Tell me
so this matter can be over now.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.947
I was assigned by Sultan Aleaddin
to solve this matter.

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:39.580
And I will take care of it,
Ameer Almighty.

01:25:41.013 --> 01:25:43.647
As you see, my brother is involved.

01:25:44.313 --> 01:25:47.247
Perchance, your soldiers
get involved in this matter

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:49.213
what would the situation be like?

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:52.080
I cannot allow it.
You should understand me.

01:25:54.513 --> 01:25:56.947
Then solve this matter, Sungurtekin Bey.

01:26:00.413 --> 01:26:02.480
Or else, the state's iron fist

01:26:03.447 --> 01:26:06.380
will go down on Ertugrul's
and Kayis' neck.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.880
You should know it like this.

01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:07.447
<i>I have waited all these years</i>
 <i>to reach Aykiz.</i>

01:27:08.147 --> 01:27:12.947
Do I not know, my bloody violet set
her eyes on the road in our tent

01:27:13.013 --> 01:27:16.013
waiting for me. Do not I know?

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:21.180
How cannot I come running to you
when I know this, Aykiz?

01:27:34.913 --> 01:27:36.580
<i>Is there permission, Turgut Alp?</i>

01:27:42.247 --> 01:27:43.480
Come, Turali.

01:27:50.347 --> 01:27:53.013
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:27:57.847 --> 01:28:01.013
Are you going to quit me
like Wild Demir, too?

01:28:03.213 --> 01:28:04.447
Come, sit down.

01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:14.047
From now on, I confide the nomad tent
to you. Look after the nomad tent.

01:28:14.313 --> 01:28:17.013
That is what Wild Demir said
before he left, too.

01:28:23.847 --> 01:28:25.880
A brave man must be on his path.

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:29.647
Wild Demir attained martyrdom
on his path, too.

01:28:31.413 --> 01:28:34.180
Our share is to say, may God
destine us the same.

01:28:36.447 --> 01:28:39.413
-Be strong, my lad.
-Do not go, Bey.

01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:01.847
<i>-Is there permission, Turgut Alp?</i>
-Yes, Bey.

01:29:17.947 --> 01:29:19.347
Is your decision absolute?

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:23.913
It's time, Bey.

01:29:24.347 --> 01:29:25.913
Is Ertugrul the reason?

01:29:31.413 --> 01:29:32.480
Turgut Alp.

01:29:33.947 --> 01:29:37.113
I have been thinking about what
you said at Wild Demir's shop.

01:29:38.447 --> 01:29:41.880
Ertugrul and Noyan are at Geyikli cave,
is that so?

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:49.413
Look, Turgut Alp, brother.

01:29:50.213 --> 01:29:52.980
Tell me the truth thoroughly.

01:29:53.247 --> 01:29:56.947
Tell me, so I can stop Ertugrul
before he acts foolishly again.

01:29:58.847 --> 01:30:02.547
There is one thing I know, and that is
I cannot stay here anymore, Bey.

01:30:03.013 --> 01:30:06.513
Only his Bey can bend
a brave man like you.

01:30:07.413 --> 01:30:10.147
Tell me, what is Ertugrul's intention?

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:20.613
He wishes to take Noyan and Yigit
to Sultan Aleaddin, Bey.

01:30:21.847 --> 01:30:23.147
Noyan, too?

01:30:25.447 --> 01:30:30.480
Do not ask more. I do not know
what is right or wrong anymore, Bey.

01:30:50.847 --> 01:30:53.480
Sultan Aleaddin's loyal Alp, Ertugrul.

01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:00.147
You are still loyal to Sultan even while
he is coming to take your head.

01:31:01.247 --> 01:31:04.147
You do not see, if you go on like this,
you will lose your head.

01:31:06.847 --> 01:31:10.313
You both will loosen your tongue
when you go to Sultan's presence.

01:31:25.247 --> 01:31:26.647
You are right, Ertugrul.

01:31:28.647 --> 01:31:31.447
Fear of death would make one do anything.

01:31:32.547 --> 01:31:37.180
Gokce Hatun loosened her tongue
before I cut her throat, too.

01:31:38.013 --> 01:31:42.313
Turgut Alp's woman, before
she burned furiously

01:31:43.113 --> 01:31:44.347
she was the same.

01:31:45.247 --> 01:31:46.947
She loosened her tongue, too.

01:31:48.113 --> 01:31:51.280
She was begging, "Do not do it,
I am with a child."

01:31:55.613 --> 01:31:57.913
Yet, I am not like them, Ertugrul.

01:31:58.613 --> 01:32:00.647
Death is an honor for me.

01:32:06.347 --> 01:32:09.380
What is the matter, Ertugrul?
Why are you silent?

01:32:10.513 --> 01:32:12.947
Do you think you will scare me with death?

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:16.180
I said what I needed to.

01:32:16.547 --> 01:32:19.080
Do your worst.

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:24.847
You should know, you will regret
not killing me. I will keep my oath.

01:32:26.113 --> 01:32:30.547
Whoever is in your blood, I will
kill them all with my own hands.

01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:38.546
Let us see if you will have the pleasure
I had, when you batten my hand.

01:35:15.113 --> 01:35:17.547
Gundogdu, I do not see Sungurtekin.
Where is he?

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:22.347
Ameer Sadettin summoned him
to caravansary, mother.

01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:27.180
What bother would Ameer Sadettin have,
he called my son?

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:29.080
I do not know, mother.

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:35.513
Whenever Ameer Sadettin calls Sungurtekin

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:38.880
you fall out with Ertugrul.

01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:43.280
He wishes to sow discord among brothers.
Do you still not understand it?

01:35:46.513 --> 01:35:48.647
You talk nice, you are right, mother.

01:35:49.213 --> 01:35:53.380
But you always look outside for wrong.
However, the wrong is within us.

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.413
Turn around and look at
what your son, Ertugrul does.

01:36:01.013 --> 01:36:02.113
Gundogdu.

01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:05.347
What happens with your own blood
shall stay within your own blood.

01:36:05.447 --> 01:36:08.613
Do not you know matters
about your brothers

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.580
about your marquee shall not be
let out of nomad tent?

01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:15.180
My mother is right, brother.

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.947
Why do you not sit and talk
with my brother but do this?

01:36:18.213 --> 01:36:20.480
Do not meddle in your elders' business.
Eat your food.

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.947
I am from this marquee, too, brother.

01:36:23.213 --> 01:36:25.547
I have a right to say a few words
on my mother's dinner, too.

01:36:27.113 --> 01:36:29.513
Ertugrul is done and now
will we deal with you?

01:36:30.547 --> 01:36:33.013
I do not know what bother
you have with Ertugrul Brother.

01:36:33.113 --> 01:36:34.913
Yet, it is quite clear who is in wrong.

01:36:35.913 --> 01:36:37.047
Dundar!

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:39.547
Enough!

01:36:40.147 --> 01:36:42.413
Dundar, he is your brother.

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:51.380
If it continues like this Ertugrul Brother
will not be by our side one day.

01:36:51.513 --> 01:36:54.847
I hope you listen to his words carefully.
Or we will all suffer from it.

01:36:57.547 --> 01:37:00.613
Dundar, you crossed well beyond your line.

01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:03.647
Gundogdu! Dundar! Stop!

01:37:10.213 --> 01:37:11.380
By your leave, mother.

01:37:12.413 --> 01:37:15.213
Dundar, tell me, brother.

01:37:18.013 --> 01:37:20.313
Did Ertugrul make your blood
boil against us, too?

01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.613
May my blood be sacrificed for
Ertugrul Brother's path, brother.

01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:26.247
But, you with this fury of yours,
who knows whose blood you will boil?

01:37:26.913 --> 01:37:29.180
You come to my mother's marquee
and ask for a headquarters, brother.

01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:30.980
You are not cut to become a Bey.

01:37:41.247 --> 01:37:42.513
Shame on you.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.913
Shame on you.

01:37:46.147 --> 01:37:50.647
Look at what state my sons are in
at Suleyman Shah's marquee.

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:55.313
Brothers cannot sit down to the same meal.

01:37:56.547 --> 01:38:01.847
Either you pull yourselves together
and behave as it suits you

01:38:02.147 --> 01:38:06.180
or I know what I will do.

01:38:56.847 --> 01:38:58.913
We will rummage everywhere.

01:38:59.847 --> 01:39:01.347
We will not return until we find them.

01:39:54.247 --> 01:39:55.380
Child.

01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:59.013
-Who is this brave Alp?
-Ertugrul Bey.

01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:01.947
Do you know where Ertugrul Bey's Alps are?

01:40:02.247 --> 01:40:03.580
I am one of his Alps.

01:40:05.847 --> 01:40:07.913
I knew you were a brave young man.

01:40:09.113 --> 01:40:11.980
Tell me. I saw Turgut Alp
entering the marquee.

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:16.480
He has prepared his horse and belongings.
Apparently, he will go far away.

01:40:17.947 --> 01:40:20.647
He would not leave Ertugrul Bey.
He will return.

01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:41.847
You are not telling me what happened.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:48.213
But you are always welcome
to my marquee, son.

01:40:49.613 --> 01:40:53.247
I have never seen you,
Ertugrul's other Alps

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:55.880
any different than my own sons.

01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:58.280
I know, Mother Hayme.

01:40:59.647 --> 01:41:01.047
If you want to return...

01:41:01.147 --> 01:41:03.213
There is no return for me anymore,
Mother Hayme.

01:41:08.947 --> 01:41:10.347
Give your blessings.

01:41:14.413 --> 01:41:16.147
I give my blessings, son.

01:41:22.947 --> 01:41:24.880
May God keep your path bright.

01:41:29.413 --> 01:41:30.513
Turgut Alp.

01:41:33.513 --> 01:41:35.947
You are a very precious Alp for us.

01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:40.047
We have been to many battles together,
reached to many destinations.

01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:44.613
Do not do it. This nomad group needs you.

01:41:46.347 --> 01:41:49.980
Thank you, Bey. But this is it for me.

01:41:53.147 --> 01:41:56.147
I cannot stay here any longer

01:41:57.013 --> 01:41:58.947
when my heart is burning
for reunion with my beloved.

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:01.947
-Understand me.
-Alright.

01:42:02.847 --> 01:42:05.313
-Let me kiss your hand, Bey.
-There is no need, brother. Come here.

01:42:32.147 --> 01:42:35.380
Even your closest Alp cannot bear you.

01:43:51.491 --> 01:43:53.158
Tell me, brother.

01:43:54.358 --> 01:44:00.491
Why would you assign Halime Hatun to
talk to persuade people into migration...

01:44:00.558 --> 01:44:03.191
...when everything is a mare's nest?

01:44:05.258 --> 01:44:06.891
What are you trying to do?

01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:15.758
I said what I needed to, brother.

01:44:16.491 --> 01:44:21.258
Whoever wants to come with us on this
blessed path for holy war, to settle...

01:44:21.558 --> 01:44:23.891
...my path is their path,
their life is my life.

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:26.625
I have nothing to say beyond this.

01:44:28.491 --> 01:44:30.125
Shame, brother, shame.

01:44:30.658 --> 01:44:32.558
You have really lost your way.

01:44:33.758 --> 01:44:37.658
How quickly you forgot
what Suleyman Shah said...

01:44:37.725 --> 01:44:40.358
...when he was breathing
his last on our hands!

01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:46.358
<i>Father! Father! Father!</i>

01:44:54.225 --> 01:44:56.291
<i>I confide my nomad group to you.</i>

01:44:57.891 --> 01:45:01.825
<i>Protect our nomad group</i>
 <i>from every malice...</i>

01:45:04.391 --> 01:45:07.925
<i>...as your wives, as your children.</i>

01:45:12.425 --> 01:45:14.425
<i>Obey to our ancestor Oghuz's mores...</i>

01:45:15.758 --> 01:45:19.658
<i>...and Seljukian, the state of these</i>
 <i>mores.</i>

01:45:22.258 --> 01:45:23.791
<i>Be one and alive.</i>

01:45:35.758 --> 01:45:38.591
Is this how you will protect our unity,
our amity?

01:45:39.225 --> 01:45:41.425
Suleyman Shah is the one who
opened my path, brother.

01:45:42.258 --> 01:45:47.925
Yet, your eyes have been so branded,
you keep wallowing beyond blindness.

01:45:48.425 --> 01:45:50.125
-Ertugrul...
-Gundogdu!

01:45:51.258 --> 01:45:52.358
Ertugrul!

01:45:53.491 --> 01:46:00.258
What do you do besides talk about unity
and amity and do the opposite?

01:46:02.725 --> 01:46:06.125
You are at one place, Gundogdu,
at another place.

01:46:06.791 --> 01:46:08.591
Sungurtekin is at another.

01:46:08.658 --> 01:46:10.591
Dundar is at another.

01:46:11.525 --> 01:46:13.858
For how much longer this will continue?

01:46:14.558 --> 01:46:15.658
It will, mother.

01:46:16.525 --> 01:46:19.525
As long as you appeal to Ertugrul,
it will.

01:46:20.925 --> 01:46:25.925
With rebel Shahzade and Halime Hatun
who provokes people...

01:46:26.558 --> 01:46:29.591
...by your side and Sultan's furious army,
on other side.

01:46:30.225 --> 01:46:34.658
When all these are clear, which Alp would
reach to ultimate reunion with you?

01:46:34.858 --> 01:46:35.891
Tell me.

01:46:38.191 --> 01:46:40.225
Brother, do not do this.

01:46:40.858 --> 01:46:44.658
Let Sungurtekin perform
the mission he was assigned.

01:46:45.291 --> 01:46:47.891
Let him kill my brother, is that
what you say, Gundogdu Bey?

01:46:48.325 --> 01:46:49.525
Halime!

01:46:52.358 --> 01:46:57.658
I will not let Sungur or you do something
you will regret later, brother.

01:46:58.425 --> 01:47:02.258
Both Sungurtekin and you gave your
leash on Kopek's hands such a way...

01:47:02.325 --> 01:47:03.358
Ertugrul!

01:47:03.625 --> 01:47:05.258
Gundogdu, Ertugrul!

01:47:12.425 --> 01:47:15.358
Ertugrul, what will you do?

01:47:16.325 --> 01:47:18.225
Tell me, what will you do, son?

01:47:20.625 --> 01:47:22.491
I will take the road with Halime, mother.

01:47:23.525 --> 01:47:25.125
Yigit will come with us, too.

01:47:26.925 --> 01:47:28.725
I will appear before Sultan.

01:47:29.758 --> 01:47:31.825
I will explain all that happened.

01:47:32.825 --> 01:47:34.525
Kopek's games...

01:47:35.158 --> 01:47:37.791
...Gumustekin, Noyan.

01:47:39.291 --> 01:47:41.291
What they did to Tugtekin and Gokce.

01:47:41.758 --> 01:47:43.491
Do you think Sultan would believe you?

01:47:43.691 --> 01:47:45.191
He will, brother.

01:47:45.858 --> 01:47:47.258
That is all I will say.

01:47:49.258 --> 01:47:50.925
I have always believed in you, son.

01:47:51.791 --> 01:47:55.458
Even though every word coming
out of your mouth wounded us...

01:47:56.158 --> 01:47:57.591
...I saw they were true.

01:47:58.158 --> 01:47:59.391
Perhaps, you are right.

01:47:59.925 --> 01:48:03.658
But what good would being right do?

01:48:04.825 --> 01:48:06.558
After all these pains...

01:48:07.358 --> 01:48:10.258
...do not put us through pain of
separation.

01:48:18.491 --> 01:48:21.591
If Sultan believes my words
and lets us live...

01:48:22.825 --> 01:48:26.425
...I will migrate to Byzantium border
with gallant men who believe in me.

01:48:30.925 --> 01:48:32.425
That is all I will say, Mother.

01:48:33.591 --> 01:48:35.325
Give your blessings.

01:48:40.358 --> 01:48:42.225
I have nothing else to say.

01:49:11.158 --> 01:49:12.358
He will not give up, Mother.

01:49:13.291 --> 01:49:14.691
Is this how it would be, son?

01:49:15.725 --> 01:49:19.891
Would Suleyman Shah's blessed marquee
witness to these, too?

01:49:21.825 --> 01:49:23.691
May whatever is best for us happen,
Mother.

01:49:24.458 --> 01:49:27.225
Come, Dodurga headquarters
is waiting for us.

01:50:09.791 --> 01:50:12.758
I have been waiting for the moment
I will reach my brother for so long.

01:50:13.325 --> 01:50:15.725
Thank God, I saw it, too. Thanks to you.

01:50:20.191 --> 01:50:23.491
But there is a matter I want you to know,
Ertugrul.

01:50:24.791 --> 01:50:27.358
Sungurtekin Bey went to Ameer Sadettin.

01:50:27.825 --> 01:50:29.358
He was not at dinner either.

01:50:30.325 --> 01:50:34.458
I fear Sungurtekin Bey will do something
bad to my brother.

01:50:49.891 --> 01:50:51.858
We must take the road at once,
Halime Sultan.

01:50:52.191 --> 01:50:53.658
We have not time to lose.

01:51:13.591 --> 01:51:16.758
In the 99 names of God Almighty,
the merciful, the compassionate...

01:51:16.891 --> 01:51:20.491
...who fills our heart
with divine light of faith.

01:51:24.125 --> 01:51:26.191
Dodurga's gallant and glorious Beys...

01:51:26.691 --> 01:51:30.125
May God let Tugtekin Bey rest in heaven...

01:51:30.458 --> 01:51:34.925
...he who reached God's grace while he was
fighting for God against the tyrant.

01:51:35.291 --> 01:51:36.425
Amen.

01:51:37.491 --> 01:51:42.391
We gathered here to choose the new Bey
for Seigniory position...

01:51:42.458 --> 01:51:44.625
...that is left empty after Tugtekin Bey.

01:51:46.191 --> 01:51:50.691
May the new Bey who will be chosen
be fortunate for Dodurga tribe, already.

01:51:51.258 --> 01:51:52.591
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:51:52.825 --> 01:51:56.258
-Amen.
-May God be his helper and his friend.

01:51:56.325 --> 01:51:57.691
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:51:58.125 --> 01:52:02.158
Now, Hayme Hatun will have her
say to lead the headquarters.

01:52:03.691 --> 01:52:05.291
Go ahead, Hayme Hatun.

01:52:09.258 --> 01:52:12.291
Gallant and glorious Beys of
Dodurga nomad group...

01:52:13.891 --> 01:52:16.391
...Dodurga nomad group
is my nomad group, too.

01:52:16.791 --> 01:52:20.525
My late father and brother were a Bey...

01:52:20.591 --> 01:52:26.291
...and served first to God, then to their
state and then to their nomad group.

01:52:28.125 --> 01:52:30.725
It made me happy beyond measure...

01:52:31.591 --> 01:52:34.425
...that you gave me the duty of
leading the headquarters.

01:52:35.691 --> 01:52:37.591
I know, on this tough day...

01:52:38.358 --> 01:52:43.825
...Dodurga's Bey will make the best
decision and choose their Bey.

01:52:46.591 --> 01:52:51.258
-May God render your tribe everlasting.
-Amen.

01:52:52.158 --> 01:52:54.925
Who wishes to become
Bey of Dodurga nomad group?

01:53:16.925 --> 01:53:23.591
Akca Bey and Artuk Bey put themselves
in for the position of Bey of Dodurga.

01:53:25.591 --> 01:53:29.758
Before we move on to choosing,
do you have anything to say?

01:53:30.291 --> 01:53:31.525
I do, Hayme Hatun.

01:53:32.691 --> 01:53:33.825
Go ahead.

01:53:35.525 --> 01:53:37.258
Dodurga's Beys...

01:53:37.758 --> 01:53:39.591
...if you choose me as Bey...

01:53:40.258 --> 01:53:44.625
...by using all means and
with the support of the state...

01:53:45.491 --> 01:53:50.425
...I will make our nomad group regain
peace and safety we long for...

01:53:50.491 --> 01:53:52.491
...if God permits.

01:53:54.458 --> 01:53:55.791
Thank you, Akca Bey.

01:53:57.191 --> 01:53:59.791
Artuk Bey, do you have something to say?

01:54:00.258 --> 01:54:02.325
-I do, Hayme Hatun.
-Go ahead.

01:54:03.925 --> 01:54:05.458
Dodurga's Beys...

01:54:06.425 --> 01:54:11.825
...it is time for Dodurga nomad group
to awaken its own will and mind.

01:54:13.325 --> 01:54:18.358
The might we need to make our
nomad group regain peace is within us.

01:54:19.225 --> 01:54:22.291
That is the purpose of me standing
for Seigniory.

01:54:22.591 --> 01:54:26.158
Let us regain peace together.

01:54:27.291 --> 01:54:31.758
If God permits, this choosing will
be fortunate for our nomad group.

01:54:39.791 --> 01:54:44.325
Glorious Beys of Dodurga,
let us move on to choosing.

01:54:44.758 --> 01:54:47.725
Who would like Akca Bey to be Bey?

01:55:15.691 --> 01:55:19.691
Who would like Artuk Bey to be Bey?

01:55:51.425 --> 01:55:55.391
The new Bey of Dodurga nomad group is
Akca Bey.

01:55:58.191 --> 01:55:59.191
May it be the best.

01:56:00.191 --> 01:56:01.525
Thank you, Hayme Hatun.

01:56:02.691 --> 01:56:04.591
Here.

01:56:12.325 --> 01:56:15.625
May your Bey position be the best
for Dodurga nomad group, Akca Bey.

01:56:15.825 --> 01:56:17.458
Thank you, Gundogdu Bey.

01:56:18.125 --> 01:56:20.858
May your Bey position be the best
for our nomad group, Akca Bey.

01:56:21.725 --> 01:56:23.225
Thank you, Bey.

01:56:30.758 --> 01:56:33.158
May your Bey position be the best
for our nomad group, Bey.

01:57:07.858 --> 01:57:10.725
Brother, I will come to Byzantium with you
like Yigit.

01:57:15.291 --> 01:57:16.491
What about my Mother?

01:57:16.925 --> 01:57:18.358
What if my Mother does not come?

01:57:18.425 --> 01:57:20.358
My brothers would not leave my Mother
alone.

01:57:21.158 --> 01:57:22.625
And I will not leave you alone.

01:57:23.191 --> 01:57:26.525
Neither you, nor Halime Sultan, or Gunduz.

01:57:27.391 --> 01:57:29.491
You are my marquee from now on, brother.

01:57:29.825 --> 01:57:31.225
Thank you.

01:57:31.758 --> 01:57:34.658
Once we return safely we will talk about
these.

01:57:34.725 --> 01:57:36.925
If God permits, may your path be bright,
brother.

01:57:37.525 --> 01:57:38.891
Thank you.

01:58:04.258 --> 01:58:06.558
-Be under God's watch.
-Be under God's watch, brother.

01:59:56.891 --> 01:59:59.625
We will be before Sultan's presence
before three days, Halime Sultan.

02:00:00.891 --> 02:00:02.891
When he reads the letter Yigit sent...

02:00:03.125 --> 02:00:05.925
...Sultan will believe Yigit is innocent,
Ertugrul.

02:00:06.858 --> 02:00:08.558
If God permits, Halime.

02:00:09.125 --> 02:00:11.591
If we cannot prove Kopek is in betrayal...

02:00:12.191 --> 02:00:14.758
...not only us but also our state will be
under threat.

02:00:15.358 --> 02:00:18.725
We must make both Noyan and
Bogach appear before Sultan.

02:00:35.491 --> 02:00:37.525
Hasten, brother, I will die of starvation.

02:00:37.591 --> 02:00:39.358
Take it, brother, here.

02:01:02.291 --> 02:01:03.425
Brothers.

02:01:22.125 --> 02:01:23.458
Give Shahzade to me.

02:01:24.691 --> 02:01:26.558
Our hangman is here, Bogach.

02:01:26.825 --> 02:01:29.458
-Do not raise difficulties.
-Do not, Bey.

02:01:29.858 --> 02:01:31.858
We will not give him to you.

02:01:32.291 --> 02:01:34.891
Ertugrul Bey trusted us with Yigit Alp.

02:01:35.291 --> 02:01:36.658
We cannot give him to you, Bey.

02:01:37.358 --> 02:01:39.491
I do not want to hurt you.

02:01:39.658 --> 02:01:40.891
Lower your swords.

02:01:41.158 --> 02:01:42.458
Do not, Bey.

02:01:42.725 --> 02:01:44.625
We will protect him at the cost of
our lives.

02:01:46.291 --> 02:01:47.658
Move aside.

02:01:49.358 --> 02:01:51.758
You are dragging yourself, Ertugrul Bey...

02:01:52.425 --> 02:01:54.358
...and our nomad group to disaster.

02:01:54.491 --> 02:01:55.491
Do not, Bey.

02:01:55.858 --> 02:01:57.325
Alps!

02:02:02.758 --> 02:02:04.458
Attack!

02:04:28.458 --> 02:04:29.725
Ertugrul, who are they?

02:04:30.391 --> 02:04:31.525
My brother.

02:04:34.491 --> 02:04:35.791
Yigit.

02:04:36.225 --> 02:04:37.691
Wait here, Halime.

02:05:23.391 --> 02:05:24.658
Forgive me, boy.

02:05:24.758 --> 02:05:28.325
I must do this for the continuity
of the state, for Ertugrul.

02:05:31.825 --> 02:05:33.225
Brother!

02:05:38.125 --> 02:05:39.291
Enough, brother, enough!

02:05:39.425 --> 02:05:41.525
Enough, Ertugrul! This will be over!

02:05:41.658 --> 02:05:42.691
Brother.

02:05:53.558 --> 02:05:57.225
Ertugrul, I will save you and our
nomad group from this trouble.

02:05:57.425 --> 02:05:59.625
Do not stand in front of me.
Do not stop me.

02:05:59.891 --> 02:06:03.558
Sultan's edict must be fulfilled for
the continuity of the state.

02:06:03.725 --> 02:06:05.525
-Move aside, Ertugrul!
-Brother!

02:06:09.891 --> 02:06:11.725
Yigit! Brother!

02:10:43.858 --> 02:10:45.891
Bey. Sungurtekin.

02:11:00.891 --> 02:11:01.891
Brother.

02:11:05.391 --> 02:11:06.491
Brother.

02:11:06.758 --> 02:11:08.625
Brother! Brother!

02:11:08.758 --> 02:11:11.291
Stay with me! You will heal, brother.
