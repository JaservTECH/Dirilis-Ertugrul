00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 60 will start after 12:36 min.

12:36.401 --> 12:40.852
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:50.107 --> 12:51.707
You will be okay.

12:52.507 --> 12:53.573
Help.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.473
Help. Brother!

12:55.540 --> 12:58.273
To nomad tent, quickly. Quick.
Raise him up, Alps.

13:25.307 --> 13:28.873
What I wanted to say is Mother,
neither me...

13:29.107 --> 13:31.773
...nor Sungurtekin or nomad group's
Beys have patience left.

13:32.740 --> 13:34.173
Gundogdu...

13:34.340 --> 13:37.773
...I told you there will be no
headquarters without Ertugrul!

13:38.373 --> 13:39.740
Do you not hear my words?

13:39.807 --> 13:42.107
Your words are not a remedy for our ill,
Mother.

13:42.740 --> 13:46.107
I said it, erstwhile, I said we shall go
to Aleppo. You did not listen to me.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.507
I said, let us not come to these lands.
You did not listen.

13:48.907 --> 13:51.607
Neither my father nor Ertugrul
listened to me.

13:52.140 --> 13:53.840
And what happened? I was proven right.

13:54.573 --> 13:58.673
We have been through many disturbances,
we left many martyrs, it is enough.

13:59.607 --> 14:02.540
You know Ertugrul's intention
from the beginning.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.640
You know but you do not tell.

14:05.207 --> 14:07.640
The more you keep silent
the more he goes out of line.

14:08.673 --> 14:09.673
Mother...

14:10.173 --> 14:13.607
...you are confusing being a substitute
for Bey and motherhood.

14:14.373 --> 14:16.273
You have a weakness for Ertugrul.

14:16.873 --> 14:20.107
And this weakness endangers
the continuity of the state.

14:20.907 --> 14:22.640
Know your place, Gundogdu!

14:24.907 --> 14:26.307
Mother...

14:26.507 --> 14:28.573
...I have talked to Beys of the
nomad group.

14:28.907 --> 14:30.507
They want headquarters.

14:31.273 --> 14:34.507
Now it is time to give what you were
resigned to its owner.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.640
Sungurtekin stands behind me, too.

14:37.307 --> 14:38.407
I know...

14:38.640 --> 14:40.873
...you have strove for us from the
beginning.

14:41.107 --> 14:42.907
Yet, Ertugrul will not stop.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.807
If there is anyone to tell him to stop,
that is me.

14:47.173 --> 14:50.807
Did you walk over me and talk to Beys?

14:51.673 --> 14:56.740
I am the safeguard for the nomad group to
not divide when Ertugrul returns, Mother.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.540
And what about the brothers dividing?

15:05.407 --> 15:09.273
Is the state dividing better
than brothers dividing?

15:10.173 --> 15:11.707
It will break if it must.

15:16.407 --> 15:19.140
So Sungurtekin thinks like you, too.

15:20.840 --> 15:25.173
Both of my sons disobey me and
want to have headquarters.

15:26.773 --> 15:28.173
Mother...

15:28.407 --> 15:30.107
...do you not understand?

15:30.207 --> 15:32.507
It is not about you, it is about Ertugrul.

15:32.773 --> 15:36.273
If we do not stop him our nomad group
will divide.

15:42.573 --> 15:44.540
Beys are awaiting me at my tent.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.140
Do you have any last words?

15:50.273 --> 15:52.640
Do you know what hell is, Gundogdu?

15:53.607 --> 15:56.873
It has no branch or wood.

15:58.673 --> 16:01.773
Each carry their own fire.

16:03.507 --> 16:08.273
Then everyone shall see
and know your doings.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.673
Suleyman Shah.

16:52.373 --> 16:57.373
The day you have told about for long
has come and knocked on our door.

16:59.173 --> 17:02.773
From now on, I have only one duty.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.907
To keep my sons together.

17:38.307 --> 17:43.107
<i>To Wise Men, who found states</i>
 <i>and destroy states...</i>

17:44.173 --> 17:47.440
<i>...greetings from Artuk, on duty.</i>

17:48.473 --> 17:54.840
<i>Many Beys', especially Akca Bey's leashes</i>
 <i>are in Ameer Sadettin's hands now.</i>

17:55.307 --> 17:58.573
<i>Unfortunately, Gundogdu Bey</i>
 <i>and Sungurtekin Bey, too...</i>

17:58.907 --> 18:01.740
<i>...esteem Ameer Sadettin's words.</i>

18:02.507 --> 18:06.840
<i>Gundogdu Bey gathering</i>
 <i>nomad group's Beys...</i>

18:07.440 --> 18:13.607
<i>...in his tent shows he is taking action</i>
 <i>with Sungurtekin Bey against Ertugrul.</i>

18:18.507 --> 18:23.540
<i>Ertugrul Bey is scorching</i>
 <i>in a violent fire.</i>

18:23.840 --> 18:28.107
<i>Yet, I have complete faith...</i>

18:28.373 --> 18:31.373
<i>...that he does not have the smallest</i>
 <i>hesitation in keeping his promise to you.</i>

18:31.807 --> 18:35.707
<i>And he will perform</i>
 <i>this duty he took on...</i>

18:35.773 --> 18:41.740
<i>...with resolution and determination</i>
 <i>against many difficulties.</i>

19:21.840 --> 19:25.140
Beys, we must do what needs to be done.

19:25.740 --> 19:29.273
It is time for all of us
to shoulder responsibility.

19:30.407 --> 19:35.207
I will stand for the Bey position
Hayme Ana holds as a substitute...

19:35.273 --> 19:36.573
...in the headquarters, tomorrow.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.907
We have wanted to see you
in Bey position for long, Gundogdu Bey.

19:40.140 --> 19:41.140
Thank you.

19:41.207 --> 19:45.140
But it is not possible for me to do this
without your support.

19:46.240 --> 19:50.740
We will raise our ruined unity,
order together.

19:52.340 --> 19:57.340
Bey, you are right but there are not
a few who appeals to Ertugrul Bey.

19:58.773 --> 20:00.873
Even though Ertugrul Bey has no claim
on being a Bey...

20:01.140 --> 20:03.107
...he confuses people's minds,
Gundogdu Bey.

20:04.107 --> 20:05.140
I know.

20:06.107 --> 20:07.140
I know.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.640
But you should know this...

20:10.307 --> 20:14.373
...when I become Bey the first job
will be to cut these cracked voices.

20:15.507 --> 20:20.207
Even if it is my brother who will
prevent us from having peace...

20:20.507 --> 20:22.540
...it is my duty to stop it.

20:23.573 --> 20:25.907
We will be one voice, one fist.

20:26.507 --> 20:32.273
And with our state's support, we will
reach the peace we search for in Ahlat...

20:32.340 --> 20:34.907
...shoulder to shoulder with Dodurgas,
if God permits.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.273
What if Ertugrul Bey stands
for being the Bey of Kayi?

20:43.473 --> 20:44.707
What will happen then?

20:48.207 --> 20:51.707
Ertugrul Bey's craft is hunting,
headquarters is my job.

20:52.673 --> 20:58.773
But if he lays claim as you said,
it is my part to tame him like jades.

20:59.107 --> 21:00.440
Do not worry.

21:00.740 --> 21:02.607
As long as we are one, Bey.

21:02.807 --> 21:04.840
-Our vote is yours, Bey.
-Thank you.

21:04.907 --> 21:06.873
-Let us be one, Bey.
-Thank you.

21:31.273 --> 21:33.307
<i>-Peace be upon you.</i>
 <i>-And peace be upon you.</i>

21:34.140 --> 21:35.440
<i>And peace be upon you.</i>

21:42.340 --> 21:46.107
If I talk to Gundogdu Bey,
would he sell his horse to me?

21:46.607 --> 21:48.573
He is counseling with his Beys
at the tent...

21:48.640 --> 21:49.873
...he would not even listen to you, Bey.

21:56.673 --> 21:59.840
I heard the Bey storm is brewing in Kayis.

22:01.807 --> 22:03.407
He said he would not sell it, Bey.

22:04.540 --> 22:07.773
You shall go on your way, search
for another horse for yourself. Go on.

22:54.107 --> 22:55.340
Dogan!

22:59.540 --> 23:00.840
What happened, Ertugrul?

23:05.207 --> 23:06.840
What is Shahzade doing at the nomad group?

23:07.107 --> 23:08.273
Brother.

23:09.740 --> 23:11.773
Slowly, Bey, slowly.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.407
Ertugrul, which cruel did this?

23:30.373 --> 23:32.773
Slowly, Bey, slowly. Be careful.

23:37.407 --> 23:38.540
Slowly, Bey.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.740
Slowly.

24:24.573 --> 24:26.107
How did it happen, Bey?

24:27.773 --> 24:29.640
He fell on a sharp log.

24:33.107 --> 24:36.207
-Hopefully, his lungs are not ruptured.
-Hopefully.

24:36.407 --> 24:38.573
It pierced the flesh and
went all the way in.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.507
Ertugrul, tell me, how did this happen?

24:49.140 --> 24:51.140
Wait outside, Bey.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.107
Ertugrul, have you lost your tongue?

25:10.673 --> 25:13.240
Sungur did not fall on a log.

25:13.573 --> 25:15.140
What happened to Sungur?

25:15.240 --> 25:16.407
Tell me the truth.

25:18.740 --> 25:21.440
Did you tell Sungur where the cave was,
brother?

25:23.740 --> 25:25.573
How could you do it?

25:26.207 --> 25:28.273
How could you tell where the cave was?

25:28.540 --> 25:32.307
How could you send him to the cave
when you know what he will do to Yigit?

25:32.840 --> 25:35.907
Answer me, first.
What happened to Sungur?

25:36.440 --> 25:39.240
It happened when I tried to stop him
from killing Yigit.

25:40.207 --> 25:41.840
What are you saying, Ertugrul?

25:42.807 --> 25:44.373
Oh God!

25:44.840 --> 25:48.340
It was not enough you thwarted
Ameer Sadettin's orders...

25:48.407 --> 25:50.640
...and you shed your brother's blood?

25:51.407 --> 25:52.673
O, woe to us!

25:59.907 --> 26:03.540
Sungur attacked the cave with Alps
because of you.

26:03.707 --> 26:07.307
I was going to prove the troubles
Noyan and Bogach brought to us...

26:07.440 --> 26:09.540
...that they were working with Kopek!

26:11.807 --> 26:14.440
It happened by accident when
I was trying to stop Sungur.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.440
Ertugrul?

26:19.740 --> 26:21.240
Gundogdu?

26:22.173 --> 26:23.840
What happened to Sungurtekin?

26:25.807 --> 26:31.173
Sungur is inside, struggling to stay alive
because of Ertugrul.

26:31.740 --> 26:33.773
My God, you protect us!

26:35.673 --> 26:37.607
What did you do, Ertugrul?

26:38.373 --> 26:41.473
-Mother.
-He said it, Mother. Sungur said it.

26:41.807 --> 26:45.707
He said, a brother's blood will be shed
in this nomad group because of Ertugrul...

26:45.773 --> 26:47.740
...sooner or later.

26:47.807 --> 26:51.207
It finally happened. Ertugrul shed his
brother's blood.

26:53.173 --> 26:54.640
Is this true?

26:56.573 --> 26:59.340
-Mother, listen.
-Is this true?

27:05.573 --> 27:07.373
Shame on you!

27:08.573 --> 27:11.373
You finally have your brother's blood
on your hands.

27:13.307 --> 27:15.207
Shame on you.

28:41.453 --> 28:44.853
Mother, what did you do?
How could you shoot him without...

28:44.920 --> 28:47.520
...listening, Mother?
-Dundar, do not get involved.

28:47.587 --> 28:49.087
Enough, that is enough...

28:49.587 --> 28:51.820
...how can you say that
Ertugrul brother...

28:51.887 --> 28:54.020
...intends to kill Sungurtekin?
-Dundar!

28:54.853 --> 28:56.587
As if your slap was not enough...

28:56.820 --> 28:59.353
...are you going to beat me up, brother?
-Enough, enough!

29:01.153 --> 29:03.287
The seigniory fire is spreading, Mother...

29:03.587 --> 29:06.853
...two brothers on one side
and brother Ertugrul on the other.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.853
Go away Dundar, get out of here right now.

29:23.253 --> 29:25.487
Sungurtekin, my son.

29:34.020 --> 29:38.253
I will do whatever is needed,
do not worry, Mother Hayme.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.020
Son.

29:44.987 --> 29:50.053
Dogan Alp, Banu Cicek, prepare
a tent for Ertugrul Bey and us.

29:50.120 --> 29:52.487
Do not worry about it, Halime Sultan.

29:53.353 --> 29:55.987
Yigit, you will stay in Alps' tent.

29:56.220 --> 29:58.487
Bamsi, do not leave my brother alone.

29:58.553 --> 30:01.287
Your wish is my command, Halime Sultan.

30:02.120 --> 30:05.953
The arrow has left the bow.
There is no hesitation, no retreat now.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.253
We shall have no complaints.
No one should regret that...

30:10.320 --> 30:13.987
...our task is to stand firmly
behind Ertugrul Bey until the end.

30:15.587 --> 30:18.420
Our Bey always said that
whatever the conditions are...

30:18.553 --> 30:20.553
...Alps shall never give up.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.887
We shall not give up anymore, Bamsi.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.820
We shall fight side by side
with Ertugrul Bey.

30:30.953 --> 30:34.220
-We will, Halime Sultan.
-Go now.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.587
Ak Tolgali.

31:30.353 --> 31:34.953
I saw that, the one thing
that subverts a man the most...

31:35.020 --> 31:38.953
...is neither the enemy
nor the burden on his shoulders...

31:39.020 --> 31:41.820
...nor all his sufferings.

31:42.387 --> 31:44.553
The thing that subverts a man the most...

31:44.920 --> 31:50.953
...is the wound, stab in the back caused
by and the betrayal of their closest.

31:53.553 --> 31:55.920
Not being understood ruins a brave.

31:57.553 --> 32:02.287
Despite screaming all the facts,
no one hearing you...

32:03.853 --> 32:05.087
...breaks the heart.

32:05.920 --> 32:08.887
I saw it, now I know better.

32:11.453 --> 32:16.820
They should know that we came to this
point by fighting all the obstacles...

32:17.953 --> 32:22.353
...all the traps, all the bans
they have set for us.

32:24.087 --> 32:25.987
And in the future that awaits us...

32:26.053 --> 32:31.420
...we shall not back up from
a fight on the road we know is just.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.120
In this cause,
which we are eager to die for...

32:36.853 --> 32:42.987
...even if those who hold us back are from
our own blood, we shall not hesitate.

32:44.487 --> 32:45.987
Whatever they do...

32:47.220 --> 32:50.087
...whatever they try, shall be in vain.

32:51.153 --> 32:53.987
A message came from the Supreme.

32:54.387 --> 32:56.587
They will not be able to stop it.

32:58.987 --> 33:00.453
Come, my brave.

33:21.520 --> 33:25.220
Brother, I know that
my mother is making you sad.

33:27.087 --> 33:29.553
My mother will soon realize
that it was an accident.

33:30.420 --> 33:33.587
She is already very upset
after what she did to you.

33:38.187 --> 33:41.020
Brother, know that from now on,
your way is my way.

33:43.953 --> 33:45.420
Thank you, Dundar.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.087
Thank you.

33:49.787 --> 33:52.287
Gundogdu brother gathers
the headquarters, he is doing...

33:52.353 --> 33:56.220
...everything possible to become a Bey.
My mother resisted, but in vain.

33:57.020 --> 33:59.787
The seigniory fire has spread
all around the marquee.

33:59.920 --> 34:03.853
What will we do now?
Are we going to wait without a reaction?

34:06.387 --> 34:08.953
My brother thinks he can stop me,
if he is elected Bey.

34:10.087 --> 34:14.520
He thinks that there will be no problem
left, if he is elected as Bey...

34:15.487 --> 34:17.053
...but that is not the case.

34:17.587 --> 34:19.587
Even if I stop, our enemies will not stop.

34:20.487 --> 34:23.020
If our enemies stop, history will not.

34:23.487 --> 34:24.487
If I keep quiet...

34:25.320 --> 34:28.420
...and do not get involved in anything,
the reality will not change.

34:29.820 --> 34:30.953
Even if I stop...

34:32.120 --> 34:35.287
...the fate written
for us will surely manifest.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.420
Whatever our brothers attempt, we shall...

34:42.253 --> 34:46.987
...continue to fight in order to reach
our destination on the right path.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.220
We only trust God while on the road.

34:52.353 --> 34:54.787
We have no support other than Him.

35:08.053 --> 35:09.353
Sungurtekin was right.

35:13.253 --> 35:16.020
Ertugrul has his
brother's blood on his hands.

35:17.953 --> 35:19.853
Why? Because of his stubbornness.

35:20.787 --> 35:22.987
He drags us all into the abyss.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.453
For God's sake, Bey.

35:31.320 --> 35:34.987
You used to say that Sungur and
I disobeyed you. What happened?

35:35.587 --> 35:37.953
You see the result.

35:40.987 --> 35:45.287
If I had stopped them right at the start,
none of these would have ever happened.

35:52.887 --> 35:53.920
Artuk Bey...

35:54.287 --> 35:57.520
...what is the condition of my son?
-Fortunately, Ertugrul Bey made...

35:57.587 --> 36:00.453
...the first intervention
and stopped the bleeding, Mother Hayme.

36:01.053 --> 36:05.320
There is no vital danger. He is
going to recover soon, if God permits.

36:06.020 --> 36:09.253
-Thank goodness!
-Brother's blood has been shed.

36:10.487 --> 36:12.420
What use is it?

36:12.487 --> 36:15.020
Do not throw wood to the flames, Bey.

36:15.087 --> 36:17.087
It was an accident.

36:17.153 --> 36:21.020
Was it an accident? Was it an accident
that Ertugrul objected to...

36:21.087 --> 36:24.153
...Sultan's command?
Was it an accident also he revolt...

36:24.220 --> 36:25.853
...against the Emir Saadettin?

37:02.220 --> 37:03.253
My son.

37:04.987 --> 37:08.887
My son, thank God!

37:11.887 --> 37:13.487
Ertugrul.

37:15.420 --> 37:21.187
-Do not wear yourself out, brother.
-You must stop Ertugrul.

37:22.253 --> 37:25.587
You were right.
We now understand what happens...

37:25.820 --> 37:29.787
...when you let Ertugrul go out of
control. Do not worry, I will stop him.

37:34.053 --> 37:36.920
Will you take your brother's life?

37:37.253 --> 37:39.120
How can you say that, Mother?

37:39.187 --> 37:41.520
When did you see me go out off my way?

37:42.087 --> 37:47.087
I will tell him that he does not have
a free hand in this tribe, that is all.

37:52.320 --> 37:55.053
-Sungur, my son.
-Mother.

37:56.953 --> 37:59.353
You rest.

38:16.287 --> 38:20.987
Ertugrul and Sungurtekin fought
tooth and nail because of the Shahzade.

38:22.820 --> 38:24.920
Sungurtekin was seriously wounded.

38:26.987 --> 38:29.987
Then you deserve to be congratulated,
Ertugrul.

38:32.787 --> 38:36.487
He saved me from Noyan and...

38:36.553 --> 38:40.053
...he lost his reputation
in the eyes of his mother.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.953
Now, he would take
Sungurtekin to the tribe.

38:45.153 --> 38:50.787
He has drawn his sword against
his mother, as well as Gundogdu, now.

38:53.387 --> 38:56.353
Will you go to the tribe and...

38:56.420 --> 39:01.053
...kill Ertugrul, your highness?
-The state does not exist at all times...

39:02.453 --> 39:06.053
...with the sword. Let us leave the
task of killing Ertugrul to his brothers.

39:07.353 --> 39:10.053
When the time comes, Shahzade...

39:10.120 --> 39:13.153
...and Ertugrul will come to me.

39:18.087 --> 39:19.220
Bogac...

39:21.920 --> 39:23.153
...tell me now...

39:24.453 --> 39:28.953
...how did Ertugrul's Alps
find where Noyan is?

39:31.587 --> 39:35.587
They followed us, your highness.
We could not do anything.

39:39.153 --> 39:42.253
I cannot show tolerance
for foolishness, Bogac.

39:43.420 --> 39:45.920
I would kill you right now...

39:46.953 --> 39:52.187
...but thank God,
your favors are still fresh in my memory.

39:54.920 --> 39:58.520
I hope you will do me many more favors.

40:00.020 --> 40:01.987
You can go now.

40:52.353 --> 40:56.287
-Peace be upon you, Artuk Bey.
-And peace be upon you, Bey.

40:58.287 --> 41:02.053
-How is my brother's health?
-Do not worry, Bey. He will heal...

41:02.120 --> 41:04.120
...with the permission of God.

41:04.587 --> 41:10.287
-I hope so, Artuk Bey. God bless you.
-Thank you.

41:11.587 --> 41:14.387
Despite my mother's opposition,
my brothers have succeeded...

41:14.987 --> 41:17.320
...in persuading the Beys
in the headquarters.

41:18.520 --> 41:21.320
My brother Gundogdu will be
nominated for seignory to stop me.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.553
What are you going to do?

41:28.220 --> 41:31.253
I will join the headquarters
and be a candidate for the seigniory.

41:34.287 --> 41:36.420
There is no return from our task.

41:37.087 --> 41:38.787
Start working.

41:39.387 --> 41:41.087
Do whatever we need to.

41:41.520 --> 41:43.887
Everyone should do their own duty.

41:43.953 --> 41:47.087
We will speak individually with
the Alps and the community.

41:48.153 --> 41:54.053
-God bless us.
-Amen, Artuk Bey, amen.

42:02.553 --> 42:05.220
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

42:06.053 --> 42:07.953
Thank God.

42:08.020 --> 42:10.153
Sungurtekin Bey's wound is not deep.

42:10.220 --> 42:11.853
His liver was not torn.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.120
If God allows, he will recover quickly.

42:14.187 --> 42:18.853
-Thank God.
-God gives trouble and God gives the cure.

42:23.053 --> 42:26.187
There is wisdom even in trouble
if you have faith.

42:29.153 --> 42:30.587
Thank you, Bamsi brother.

42:33.420 --> 42:36.787
Dervish brother. I did not see Turgut Alp.

42:37.853 --> 42:41.020
-Is he not here?
-Yes, brother, where is Turgut?

42:42.153 --> 42:44.820
Turgut Alp bid farewell to the people...

42:45.387 --> 42:47.187
...and left the tribe.

42:50.920 --> 42:54.220
When he came back to the tribe
I thought his anger had passed...

42:54.287 --> 42:58.420
...but I see that it has not.

43:17.887 --> 43:19.787
-My son.
-Mother.

43:24.353 --> 43:26.187
-Water.
-Water.

43:49.487 --> 43:52.886
-Are you alright, son?
-Yes.

43:52.953 --> 43:54.153
Thank God.

43:56.886 --> 43:58.353
Peace be upon you.

44:01.087 --> 44:02.887
And peace be upon you.

44:08.887 --> 44:12.887
You almost succeeded where
Noyan had failed, Ertugrul.

44:13.987 --> 44:15.120
Noyan?

44:17.053 --> 44:18.420
Ertugrul killed Noyan.

44:20.253 --> 44:21.520
Thank God.

44:21.587 --> 44:24.353
You have taken revenge of
my brother Tugtekin.

44:32.287 --> 44:36.987
Ertugrul, I am not angry with you.

44:40.120 --> 44:41.887
It happened.

44:41.953 --> 44:44.020
Thank you, brother.

44:44.087 --> 44:48.153
Take a lesson from this
and give up on your stubbornness.

44:50.487 --> 44:54.053
Ertugrul, be with me tomorrow.

44:55.020 --> 44:58.387
Let us get rid of these troubles
you have caused, united as one.

45:00.353 --> 45:04.787
Did you not always say "the hunt is mine,
the headquarters is yours?"

45:05.787 --> 45:08.253
It is time to keep your word.

45:09.087 --> 45:11.820
We should come together
and have people say...

45:11.887 --> 45:16.120
...Suleiman Shah's sons solve
their problems, united as one.

45:21.553 --> 45:24.420
Both the hunt and the headquarters
will be mine.

45:28.387 --> 45:31.820
I want you to know that I will be
a candidate for seigniory tomorrow.

45:37.187 --> 45:38.853
With your permission, Mother.

45:39.587 --> 45:42.787
Ertugrul, are you aware of
what you are saying?

45:47.387 --> 45:50.787
How dare you be a candidate
for seigniory in your brother presence?

45:52.187 --> 45:54.287
You are not hearing
your own words, brother.

45:55.353 --> 45:58.053
As if all the trouble
you bestowed upon us is not enough...

45:58.820 --> 46:01.353
...will you be causing discord
in the headquarters?

46:01.420 --> 46:04.387
The enemy's biggest trick
is friendship, brother.

46:04.453 --> 46:07.820
You are too blind to see
the discord caused by Kopek.

46:10.020 --> 46:12.320
I will not entrust
my father's marquee on you.

46:16.120 --> 46:20.020
What kind of a man are you, Ertugrul?
You still talk about Kopek.

46:21.187 --> 46:25.153
Then, tomorrow you shall be
a candidate for the headquarters...

46:25.220 --> 46:27.353
...and learn your lesson.

46:28.820 --> 46:33.353
And know this, I will not let you destroy
the tribe my father entrusted to us.

46:34.920 --> 46:37.387
I shall not entrust my father's will to...

46:37.453 --> 46:40.387
...the Kopek's sedition.
This is my last word.

47:01.187 --> 47:03.420
The arrow has left the bow.

47:05.087 --> 47:09.353
Let us see how you will stop it without
tearing up your father's entrustment.

47:20.987 --> 47:23.820
Ertugrul will do everything
to stop you, brother.

47:25.420 --> 47:27.187
Do not worry, brother.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.353
You are with me tomorrow.

47:31.120 --> 47:33.053
Have a nice rest.

47:33.353 --> 47:35.353
Do not worry, brother.

47:44.453 --> 47:46.120
Turgut brother.

47:48.287 --> 47:50.387
When I asked for Banu Cicek's hand...

47:50.453 --> 47:52.987
...he ridiculed me and gave this weapon.

47:55.887 --> 47:58.920
He said that he would make
a bigger weapon for me for the wedding.

48:00.420 --> 48:04.287
Is that so, Turgut brother,
they will not see our wedding.

48:07.853 --> 48:12.287
If God permits, brother, we will do your
wedding with Banu Cicek sister...

48:12.353 --> 48:15.553
...when we overcome these hostilities.

48:16.220 --> 48:21.520
And maybe Turgut can come as well.
Do not think negative.

48:24.220 --> 48:26.453
God willing, brother.

48:27.520 --> 48:29.820
First, we must wait
for these tough days to pass.

48:35.087 --> 48:38.253
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

48:49.820 --> 48:55.887
When we set off on this road, did we swear
that we shall not get tired,...

48:55.953 --> 48:59.487
...be defeated, that we shall reach
our destination whatever the cost?

49:00.953 --> 49:03.587
Yes, we did, Bey. We did, Bey.

49:05.287 --> 49:07.887
Now, the time has come.

49:09.520 --> 49:11.953
I nominate myself to the Kayi seigniory.

49:12.853 --> 49:16.120
Brothers, did I not say that
good news would come up.

49:16.353 --> 49:18.987
This is a good news, thanks God.

49:22.187 --> 49:26.253
Now, we are going to go to
and speak with each Alp.

49:27.287 --> 49:31.987
I know that Kayi's future depends on them.

49:33.587 --> 49:38.320
If we can take the Alps' support,
we can achieve our goal.

49:38.920 --> 49:41.053
Do not worry, Bey.

49:41.120 --> 49:43.387
I will attend the headquarters
with you, brother...

49:43.453 --> 49:45.287
...I will not leave you alone.

49:46.820 --> 49:48.453
Thank you, Dundar Bey.

49:50.487 --> 49:52.153
Thank you.

49:58.153 --> 49:59.453
Peace be upon you, Bey.

49:59.520 --> 50:03.820
Greetings and peace be upon you,
Gundogdu Bey. Come and sit please.

50:08.387 --> 50:11.887
I have a lot of responsibilities
but with a brave man like you...

50:11.953 --> 50:15.220
...on my back, we will not be overcome.

50:17.453 --> 50:22.220
Now, it is time for me to take
the burden of the Kayis on my shoulders.

50:22.387 --> 50:24.453
You should have done it earlier,
Gundogdu Bey.

50:24.887 --> 50:27.153
You kept quiet for Mother Hayme's sake.

50:27.220 --> 50:30.253
As you kept quiet, Ertugrul Bey
put you in this situation.

50:32.020 --> 50:34.387
I will be a nominee
in the headquarters tomorrow.

50:34.453 --> 50:37.120
We shall set the path for Kayis together.

50:37.520 --> 50:42.820
Hope for the best. Since I know that
no one can challenge you...

50:42.887 --> 50:45.453
...I can congratulate you now.

50:45.520 --> 50:49.987
You speak like this but tomorrow
Ertugrul will also be running.

50:50.853 --> 50:55.120
Don't say that. How can he come forward
against his big brother? How dare he?

50:56.120 --> 51:01.187
You do not know him. His Alps hang
on his lips, they are very loyal to him.

51:02.853 --> 51:07.253
Even if all the Alps come together,
it is not worth as much as one Bey vote.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.320
Do you not know that, Gundogdu Bey?

51:09.387 --> 51:13.987
You say so but even Tugtekin Bey,
on his last breath...

51:14.053 --> 51:16.987
...wished that Ertugrul
would root at Byzantine boundaries.

51:18.020 --> 51:21.387
Ertugrul could even persuade
Tugtekin Bey, imagine what he can do...

51:21.453 --> 51:24.287
...to persuade the Alps.

51:24.353 --> 51:28.420
-What are you talking about, Gundogdu Bey?
-Do not disdain to Ertugrul.

51:32.253 --> 51:35.887
I want to go on the path of Korkut Bey
and I would like to make...

51:35.953 --> 51:39.187
...one fate from the two tribes, like you.
You know that it is important...

51:39.253 --> 51:41.453
...for you to be the Kayi Bey
for Dodurgas as well.

51:42.220 --> 51:45.220
I want you to know that
I will do anything to support you.

51:46.120 --> 51:49.253
Thank you. Thank you.

52:54.820 --> 52:56.087
This cradle...

52:59.120 --> 53:00.920
...where I rocked my Sungur...

53:02.420 --> 53:04.453
...Ertugrul and Dundar...

53:08.787 --> 53:10.887
...is heartbroken now.

53:17.387 --> 53:18.520
My God...

53:20.453 --> 53:21.920
...don't let my sons...

53:23.553 --> 53:28.153
...to be scattered like beads.

53:33.220 --> 53:40.220
Do not put seeds of discord within
the graceful tribe of Suleiman Shah.

53:46.087 --> 53:50.887
Take my life my God,
do not make me suffer this pain.

54:00.953 --> 54:02.920
Do we have permission, Mother Hayme?

54:06.287 --> 54:07.987
Come in, Abdurrahman.

54:14.853 --> 54:20.520
-You called for me, Mother Hayme.
-Yes, take this cradle to Halime Sultan.

54:28.787 --> 54:30.253
As you wish, Mother Hayme.

55:14.520 --> 55:18.587
Ertugrul's words have confused
the minds of the  people.

55:23.353 --> 55:25.320
I will talk to Beys tomorrow.

55:28.587 --> 55:30.920
You talk to their wives.

55:32.387 --> 55:36.187
Inquire about who their husbands
think should lead the tribe.

55:37.153 --> 55:43.153
-Do not worry, I shall inquire tomorrow.
-Do whatever you can and soothe them.

55:43.820 --> 55:45.587
They are all confused.

55:47.487 --> 55:50.220
I will not give up my marquee
to Ertugrul's whims.

55:53.420 --> 55:58.153
Ertugrul may be upset with me now
but soon he will understand me.

56:00.853 --> 56:02.353
Thank you, Hatun.

56:07.287 --> 56:12.253
When you become a Bey,
you can form a unity again.

56:13.253 --> 56:17.553
The brothers can come together.
You will never be separated again.

56:17.787 --> 56:21.153
We will always be together
and have peace, alright?

56:28.387 --> 56:34.853
Ertugrul Bey and Halime will come
with us when you become a Bey, right?

56:35.487 --> 56:37.487
You will convince them.

56:37.553 --> 56:43.853
He will see the truth in people's eyes.
He will see and he will know his place.

56:46.020 --> 56:50.187
Even if I get angry with him,
he is my brother.

56:53.187 --> 56:59.120
But I shall do my best
for my tribe's, my marquee's unity.

57:17.953 --> 57:19.253
Thank God.

57:21.220 --> 57:23.387
I am always with you, Ertugrul.

57:24.453 --> 57:29.287
please know that in this sacred path,
I am both your wife and your soldier.

57:33.853 --> 57:35.953
You have been my biggest power
in this path, Halime.

57:40.787 --> 57:46.220
You are the answer to prayers of
the oppressed and innocuous, Ertugrul.

57:57.787 --> 58:01.487
What if tomorrow a misfortune
comes up and you cannot be a Bey?

58:05.153 --> 58:08.920
When did we ever take a step back,
to take a step back this time?

58:12.287 --> 58:18.187
Maybe we will lose the seigniory tomorrow
but we will never give up our fight.

58:22.520 --> 58:25.553
-Can I come in?
-Come in, Abdurrahman.

58:32.253 --> 58:33.587
I brought you something.

58:36.320 --> 58:37.853
Put it there, Abdurrahman.

59:32.053 --> 59:36.420
So the divine justice
has manifested at that time.

59:38.987 --> 59:45.953
Tugtekin Bey stumbled upon Ertugrul the
dreamer and almost left Dodurga on fire.

59:49.153 --> 59:52.020
I could not believe my ears
when Gundogdu Bey said so.

59:52.420 --> 59:54.787
God saved Dodurga, as you stated.

59:55.120 --> 59:57.587
If Tugtekin Bey was alive,
what would we do?

01:00:03.287 --> 01:00:09.053
Whatever I did for Dodurgas,
surely I will do the same for Kayi.

01:00:17.553 --> 01:00:19.287
Gundogdu is a proud man.

01:00:20.387 --> 01:00:23.087
I understand that
he is embarrassed to come here.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:28.187
But he placate my anger
with his visit to you.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.053
Give this gold to Gundogdu.

01:00:46.053 --> 01:00:48.353
He does not need to know that...

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:52.220
...these came from me, he should not know
so that your friendship can grow.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:01:00.287
If someone like Tugtekin Bey
believes in Ertugrul's tactlessness...

01:01:00.387 --> 01:01:06.420
...you will wake them up from
their dreams with this gold.

01:01:17.887 --> 01:01:20.787
Alps, Ertugrul Bey is coming!

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.853
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.820
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:01:50.587 --> 01:01:54.987
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:01:55.053 --> 01:01:59.253
Long live Ertugrul Bey!

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:09.353
Alps, when we were children, why did we
dream the day we will hold our weapons?

01:02:10.953 --> 01:02:14.853
Why do we fight with love even though
we know that there is death on the line?

01:02:15.053 --> 01:02:18.453
Why do we hold a grudge to cruel?

01:02:19.287 --> 01:02:21.187
Why do we jihad with them?

01:02:21.553 --> 01:02:24.920
Is it not to stop the cruel...

01:02:24.987 --> 01:02:30.120
...and make them pay for all they did...

01:02:30.187 --> 01:02:33.953
...to the oppressed?

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:39.153
Our aim is provide our descendants
and fellow Muslims, serenity.

01:02:40.987 --> 01:02:44.853
Time is entrusted to us, brothers.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:48.187
The world is waiting something from us.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.787
We shall kill it with our faith
and stand up against the tyrants.

01:02:53.153 --> 01:02:58.153
If you are with me,
we shall destroy all of Bartin's castles.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:00.353
Each of you will be a conqueror...

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.087
...and shall waive the flag of justice.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:09.553
If you support me,
you will never put down your weapons.

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:14.387
Our flag shall not fall.

01:03:14.453 --> 01:03:21.220
Now, I ask you,
are you with me on this road?

01:03:22.087 --> 01:03:28.053
-In the name of the God!
-In the name of the God!

01:03:28.487 --> 01:03:32.120
Justice forever, freedom forever.

01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:35.820
Justice forever, freedom forever.

01:03:36.487 --> 01:03:39.787
Justice forever, freedom forever.

01:03:40.253 --> 01:03:43.953
Justice forever, freedom forever.

01:03:57.887 --> 01:04:02.887
All the pain we bear, all the troubles
we face are not enough?

01:04:03.987 --> 01:04:08.253
Why do we resist such a life
when there is a better life?

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.053
She is right, she is right.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.220
I am asking you,
is not it our right to find peace?

01:04:14.187 --> 01:04:17.587
Is it our destiny to wake
up an incident each new day?

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.187
Did we not come here from the land of
our ancestors for a more peaceful and...

01:04:23.253 --> 01:04:26.953
...a more beautiful life,
for more fertile lands?

01:04:28.253 --> 01:04:32.153
Did not we bore all that suffering
for our children...

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.220
...so that they can grow up in prosperity?

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:44.453
Halime Sultan, you are right but
we have no say in this. What can we do?

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:50.320
Our task is to help our husbands
to give the best possible decision.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:54.253
Their right choice will
change the fate of all of us.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:59.353
The new seigniory election
will be an opportunity for you.

01:05:00.053 --> 01:05:03.887
Our fate will change if your men
votes for Ertugrul.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.587
Yes, we hope.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.453
As our numbers increase, our needs grow,
our children cannot be supported.

01:05:13.353 --> 01:05:16.020
If Ertugrul Bey is chosen the
Bey of Kayi...

01:05:16.087 --> 01:05:19.587
...we will possess fertile lands,
meadows and profitable markets.

01:05:20.053 --> 01:05:23.087
We can compensate our labor.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:28.920
In the name of a new justice, persuade
make your husbands to choose Ertugrul.

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:32.820
-Yes, yes. She is right.
-She is right.

01:05:41.053 --> 01:05:44.587
I am telling you that
I will end this duality.

01:05:45.087 --> 01:05:47.787
I know that my brother started
some dualities.

01:05:48.287 --> 01:05:50.487
He is confusing people's minds.

01:05:51.353 --> 01:05:54.320
I will put a leash on him
when I become the Bey.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:59.853
Gundogdu Bey, most of the Alps think
Ertugrul Bey is right and support him.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.187
The promises of Ertugrul Bey
have boiled the Alps' blood.

01:06:03.953 --> 01:06:05.853
Alps want holy wars and...

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:10.187
...tributes. The peace you promise
will not appeal to them.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.787
Beys, Alps call for trouble.

01:06:14.853 --> 01:06:19.120
War only brings grief and distraught.

01:06:20.387 --> 01:06:27.120
They will die for trophy. We need peace,
not war. Our Alps are on the wrong track.

01:06:27.953 --> 01:06:33.187
Whatever it is, the Kayi tribe is
nothing without our Alps.

01:06:33.253 --> 01:06:36.287
Our flags are waving thanks to them.

01:06:36.853 --> 01:06:40.453
You are right, Alps are our everything...

01:06:41.287 --> 01:06:47.153
...but if you do not show them
the right way as their elders...

01:06:47.987 --> 01:06:50.287
...what can we do?

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:54.787
Then the fire in the Alps burns us.

01:07:00.287 --> 01:07:03.587
There is no word that can stop the Alps.

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:08.420
Everyone is filled with hope
by the words of Ertugrul Bey.

01:07:12.987 --> 01:07:14.420
With your permission.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.520
The peace that we expected has come.

01:07:41.087 --> 01:07:48.087
All our troubles, all our sorrows
will end when Gundogdu Bey comes...

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.353
...to this position.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:58.020
You will see how strong we are,
when the two tribes are together.

01:07:58.587 --> 01:08:04.153
-God willing!
-Turkmen tribes envy our union.

01:08:05.587 --> 01:08:08.920
They will be jealous of
our serenity and power.

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:15.487
Selcan Hatun, Halime Sultan speaks
exactly the opposite.

01:08:16.453 --> 01:08:19.120
We do not know
whom we believe Selcan Hatun.

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:21.987
There is nothing you do not know.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.487
You know that Halime is my sister.

01:08:27.587 --> 01:08:33.487
But both Halime and
her supporters are unaware...

01:08:34.853 --> 01:08:37.587
...that they drag us
unwarily into disaster.

01:08:38.987 --> 01:08:43.920
When Gundogdu is selected
as a Bey, we will all find peace.

01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:47.453
-God willing! God willing!
-We will all be one.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.287
God willing! God willing!

01:08:53.587 --> 01:09:00.587
Brave Beys of Kayi. You know, you will not
only choose a Bey to the Kayi tribe.

01:09:02.153 --> 01:09:06.320
Your decision will affect
the future of all Muslims...

01:09:06.387 --> 01:09:12.820
...who have lost their holy state
under the Mongol oppression...

01:09:12.887 --> 01:09:17.087
...all the Turkmen tribes
and the Dodurga tribe as well.

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:24.853
You will choose a guide for
headquarters that will lead us all.

01:09:28.487 --> 01:09:30.453
What is happening, Artuk Bey?

01:09:31.053 --> 01:09:35.320
Does it suit a Dodurga Bey like you
to be in a situation like this?

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:54.420
What did I do for you to talk like that,
Gundogdu Bey?

01:09:58.553 --> 01:10:01.987
You are meddling in Kayi tribe's business.

01:10:02.053 --> 01:10:07.020
This headquarters concerns both Kayi
and Dodurga and these two tribes...

01:10:07.087 --> 01:10:10.187
...are connected to each other by fate.

01:10:10.253 --> 01:10:13.153
Apparently, Ertugrul also
managed to persuade you.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.853
Nobody needs to persuade anyone else.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.553
I speak of what I know right.

01:10:19.353 --> 01:10:23.820
Thank you, Bey. Continue to talk
about what you know right then.

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:26.353
I saw what I had to see.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:32.587
But please let it be known that the ground
you put your trust on is shaking.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.787
Gundogdu Bey?
Akca Bey awaits you in his marquee.

01:10:56.358 --> 01:10:59.191
<i>-Do I have your permission, Akca Bey?</i>
-Yes, Gundogdu Bey.

01:11:05.091 --> 01:11:07.324
Sit down please. I have to talk to you.

01:11:12.524 --> 01:11:13.758
Please.

01:11:15.391 --> 01:11:16.991
Ertugrul is very strong.

01:11:18.158 --> 01:11:22.958
+He has hold of the Beys and will not
give up what he wants.

01:11:23.958 --> 01:11:25.158
You have a work cut out ahead of you.

01:11:26.791 --> 01:11:30.191
I said I would not leave you alone.
I will keep my promise.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.091
Take these.

01:11:39.391 --> 01:11:42.558
-What is this?
-The gold I bought when I sold my drove.

01:11:44.491 --> 01:11:46.524
These golds are halal.

01:11:47.024 --> 01:11:49.858
These are halal to you, Gundogdu Bey.

01:11:50.291 --> 01:11:56.158
-No way, Akca Bey. I could not take this.
-Gundogdu Bey, we need each other.

01:11:57.058 --> 01:11:59.358
It is not about you or me.

01:11:59.424 --> 01:12:03.024
Thousands of people in our tents
need us.

01:12:03.924 --> 01:12:05.324
I insist on this.

01:12:05.824 --> 01:12:09.758
You must take these golds for
our blessed future.

01:12:10.324 --> 01:12:12.358
As long as you are the Bey.

01:12:27.058 --> 01:12:28.291
Halime?

01:12:31.924 --> 01:12:36.024
When did we become like this?
What happened to us?

01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:39.758
We all fight with the future of the Kayi.

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.391
The Kayi's future?

01:12:45.124 --> 01:12:48.524
If we continue like this, we will all
scatter around like leaves.

01:12:49.091 --> 01:12:50.424
Don't you see that?

01:12:53.824 --> 01:12:55.458
We do not want separation, Selcan.

01:12:56.558 --> 01:13:00.524
Leaving you would wound both my and
Ertugrul Bey's feelings.

01:13:02.058 --> 01:13:04.058
However, there's nothing we can do.

01:13:05.157 --> 01:13:07.491
Gundogdu Bey ignored Ertugrul Bey.

01:13:08.124 --> 01:13:10.258
Do not do this, Halime Sultan.

01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:14.424
Let us keep the unity as Bey wives.

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:20.224
Ertugrul Bey should visit Gundogdu Bey,
kiss his hand and beg for forgiveness.

01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:22.291
They should unite.

01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:25.791
We shall conduce to this good deed.

01:13:26.391 --> 01:13:29.324
Them uniting meansthe unision of the Kayi.

01:13:30.091 --> 01:13:34.824
What did you say? What did Ertugrul Bey
do to beg for forgiveness?

01:13:36.358 --> 01:13:40.758
Ertugrul Bey has the same right as
Gundogdu Bey on the seigniory.

01:13:42.258 --> 01:13:46.458
We haven't made any mistakes. Contrarily
you've always looked down upon us.

01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:51.758
Good luck with that.

01:13:52.491 --> 01:13:53.958
Excuse me, Selcan.

01:14:15.124 --> 01:14:18.058
They say Ertugrul promised booty to the
Alps.

01:14:19.424 --> 01:14:20.891
He can keep promising.

01:14:25.924 --> 01:14:27.224
I do what I promise.

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:42.424
Divide these golds to the Alps equally.

01:14:46.924 --> 01:14:49.324
Ertugrul may have the support of the Alps.

01:14:49.424 --> 01:14:53.191
However, order cannot be established only
by words.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.224
"We do not have any words for the Alps."
you used to say.

01:15:07.024 --> 01:15:09.424
Now, you have something to give.

01:15:15.558 --> 01:15:19.424
You can use the rest for the caravan
preparations.

01:15:20.491 --> 01:15:23.024
-Thank you, Bey.
-You are welcome.

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:30.524
You will be on my side at the headquarters
tomorrow.

01:15:30.891 --> 01:15:32.091
Not to worry, Bey.

01:16:09.958 --> 01:16:12.158
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:16:16.458 --> 01:16:19.258
Gundogdu Bey sent you gold to share.

01:16:20.458 --> 01:16:22.058
What? Why?

01:16:33.358 --> 01:16:35.524
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:16:44.991 --> 01:16:47.458
The future of Kayi is on your shoulders.

01:16:48.824 --> 01:16:51.124
The future of Kayi is in your combating
hands.

01:16:52.324 --> 01:16:56.224
Do not forget that the future of Kayi

01:16:56.558 --> 01:17:00.291
will not be determined by outdated or
coward ideas, but by Alps

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:05.358
who run to death to be conquerors
like yourselves.

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:14.124
Our past is filled with examples of
how young people can change their future.

01:17:15.558 --> 01:17:21.057
I am asking you now.
Are you going to be my comrades?

01:17:31.424 --> 01:17:33.458
Excuse me Bey, I would like to say
something.

01:17:34.424 --> 01:17:37.324
-I am listening to you.
-Gundogdu Bey, Bey.

01:17:39.224 --> 01:17:41.158
What happened to Gundogdu Bey?
Why did you stop talking?

01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:45.758
Gundogdu Bey gave golds to men to trick
them into choosing him.

01:19:28.424 --> 01:19:29.491
<i>Bismillah.</i>

01:20:17.124 --> 01:20:20.291
God! Bless the best for us

01:20:20.758 --> 01:20:25.824
for our Bey, for our nomad group.

01:20:25.891 --> 01:20:28.191
-Amen.
-Help our Bey.

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:34.091
In this new battle he is fighting
help him be successful, my God.

01:20:34.391 --> 01:20:36.958
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:20:52.458 --> 01:20:53.758
Sheikh.

01:20:54.291 --> 01:20:57.391
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you Sheikh.

01:20:57.758 --> 01:20:58.958
And peace be upon you.

01:21:01.858 --> 01:21:05.091
-Welcome.
-Thank you. Where is Ertugrul Bey?

01:21:05.358 --> 01:21:07.091
Ertugrul Bey is at the headquarters.

01:21:07.224 --> 01:21:09.524
Kayi nomad tent will choose its new Bey
today.

01:21:12.291 --> 01:21:14.424
Ertugrul Bey is also aspired to be the new
Kayi Bey.

01:21:14.758 --> 01:21:17.758
May God bless him with the best.

01:21:17.858 --> 01:21:19.058
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:21:20.224 --> 01:21:22.458
Then, let us wait for the meeting at the
headquarters to be over.

01:21:23.058 --> 01:21:25.924
-I need to talk with Ertugrul.
-Of course.

01:21:27.824 --> 01:21:29.024
Here you are, Sheikh.

01:22:14.224 --> 01:22:15.324
Please be seated.

01:22:23.524 --> 01:22:25.424
In the name of God, the beneficent, the
merciful.

01:22:27.891 --> 01:22:33.091
The one who creates us and fills our
hearts with faith

01:22:33.424 --> 01:22:36.558
in the 99 names of Almighty God.

01:22:38.224 --> 01:22:39.324
Amen.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:46.458
Beys, this headquarter is the first one

01:22:46.558 --> 01:22:50.524
to choose the Bey after Suleyman Shah's
death.

01:22:52.291 --> 01:22:58.958
Gundogdu and Ertugrul Beys put themselves
in for to be the new Kayi Bey.

01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:03.524
-Good luck with it.
-Amen.

01:23:05.558 --> 01:23:07.524
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:23:17.091 --> 01:23:21.791
My gallant boys. My Beys. The best of
my tribe.

01:23:22.558 --> 01:23:28.024
When have I ever let you go hungry that
you worry about your daily bread?

01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:54.824
What happened, Dundar Bey?
Do you not see we are in headquarters?

01:23:56.158 --> 01:23:58.891
I would like to use my right to join this
headquarter as a Bey...

01:24:01.191 --> 01:24:02.358
...Gundogdu Bey.

01:24:11.991 --> 01:24:14.258
So there are some tricks at the
headquarters.

01:24:16.324 --> 01:24:18.491
Is this appropriate, Mother Hayme?

01:24:20.491 --> 01:24:25.491
Dundar Bey has the right to join this
meeting like the other Beys.

01:24:25.958 --> 01:24:28.458
Seeing that he wants to use his right,
he can join.

01:24:28.524 --> 01:24:29.824
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

01:24:39.224 --> 01:24:42.958
Before we begin the election for
the new Bey of the Kayi tribe

01:24:44.191 --> 01:24:46.758
Do you have anything to say, Gundogdu
Bey?

01:24:47.758 --> 01:24:48.891
Excuse me, Mother.

01:24:50.758 --> 01:24:53.391
Our honorable Beys of my blood.

01:24:54.391 --> 01:24:59.458
There was only one goal when we came
these lands that was unfamiliar to us

01:24:59.991 --> 01:25:01.824
after Suleyman Shah.

01:25:02.291 --> 01:25:04.158
We wanted a peaceful life

01:25:04.758 --> 01:25:07.091
and we wanted to expand with the support
our state.

01:25:08.158 --> 01:25:11.491
Unfortunately, neither of the goals were
realized.

01:25:12.024 --> 01:25:17.791
We woke up every day with a new incident.
We long for peace.

01:25:18.291 --> 01:25:22.324
We were just about to rebel against our
own state.

01:25:25.024 --> 01:25:26.758
When I become a Bey

01:25:27.024 --> 01:25:30.524
we will find peace of mind that we have
been looking for.

01:25:31.224 --> 01:25:36.124
We will make consultation and take
decisions, then we will immigrate.

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:42.224
We will cement our strength with the
support of our state.

01:25:43.224 --> 01:25:44.924
That is all I have to say for now.

01:25:47.558 --> 01:25:48.891
He is right.

01:25:49.857 --> 01:25:53.991
Do you have anything to say, Ertugrul Bey?

01:25:57.791 --> 01:25:59.758
Honorable Beys of our nomad tent...

01:26:00.224 --> 01:26:04.291
Why did we leave our Oghuz ancestor's
lands and go through

01:26:04.391 --> 01:26:07.291
all the trouble and pain and ended up
here?

01:26:07.891 --> 01:26:12.058
Why did we immigrate? Is it just because
of our enemies? For the grassland?

01:26:12.324 --> 01:26:14.224
Or the fertile loams?

01:26:15.491 --> 01:26:19.524
Was the pain that we went through
for our children

01:26:20.391 --> 01:26:22.458
or just for our own peace of mind?

01:26:25.024 --> 01:26:26.324
He is right.

01:26:28.524 --> 01:26:32.524
While the people who are from our
bloodline or of the same religion

01:26:32.991 --> 01:26:37.158
are anxious can we continue to believe in
a fake paradise?

01:26:41.358 --> 01:26:44.391
When the lament of the opprressed have
reached the heavens

01:26:44.524 --> 01:26:47.358
and when the cruels have seized
the sovereignty

01:26:49.091 --> 01:26:53.791
can we concentrate on our peacefulness
without beating them at their own game?

01:26:56.791 --> 01:26:58.891
Do you think that they will let this
happen?

01:27:02.158 --> 01:27:03.791
The wise Beys of the Kayi' tribe

01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:07.858
if you choose me as your new Bey, we will
be beside not only our nomad tent

01:27:07.991 --> 01:27:09.924
but also the oppressed.

01:27:10.758 --> 01:27:13.224
We will take the Kayi tribe to where
it belongs.

01:27:15.091 --> 01:27:18.224
We can only get peace in this way.

01:27:20.891 --> 01:27:27.891
Bazaars where we sell goods, fertile
plains, and fertile pastures...

01:27:28.558 --> 01:27:31.758
It is only possible through seeing that
dream.

01:27:33.224 --> 01:27:35.391
It is time to say new things.

01:27:37.758 --> 01:27:39.891
If I am choosen to be the new Bey of Kayi

01:27:40.024 --> 01:27:42.524
we will set up and perform

01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:49.024
that justice, compassion and moral
together.

01:27:51.958 --> 01:27:54.258
We will be responsible for anything that
goes around here.

01:27:55.058 --> 01:27:59.424
We will not worry about livelihood and
become a shadow of anyone.

01:28:02.358 --> 01:28:05.491
We will not buy away the consent of anyone

01:28:05.991 --> 01:28:08.924
with the gold whose source is unknown.

01:28:10.224 --> 01:28:14.158
We will not leave the right other than the
right way.

01:28:15.524 --> 01:28:19.058
Everyone should know that.
That's all I've got to say.

01:28:26.991 --> 01:28:31.524
As I can see, Ertugrul Bey does not want
us to be peaceful.

01:28:32.991 --> 01:28:34.958
He does not wake up from his dreams.

01:28:35.791 --> 01:28:41.058
I would not entrust my nomad tent to
Ertugrul's faddish.

01:28:42.458 --> 01:28:44.324
These are my last words.
Keep this in mind.

01:28:49.558 --> 01:28:52.958
One who has not dreams, has no future,
Gundogdu Bey.

01:28:54.558 --> 01:28:59.024
Our main goal is to bring the Kayi nomad
tent where it belongs.

01:28:59.458 --> 01:29:01.858
Not to turn it into a slave.

01:29:02.291 --> 01:29:04.058
And these are my last words.

01:29:07.424 --> 01:29:09.058
Thay are both right.

01:29:27.358 --> 01:29:28.524
Thank you.

01:29:54.291 --> 01:29:59.058
Now that our Beys have nothing more to
say, we can be continue with the election.

01:30:00.424 --> 01:30:07.124
I will not use my vote because both
Ertugrul and Gundogdu are my sons.

01:30:08.224 --> 01:30:11.958
Whoever wants to see Gundogdu Bey
as the new Bey of the Kayi tribe

01:30:12.191 --> 01:30:13.524
can raise their hands.

01:30:21.391 --> 01:30:24.891
Gundogdu Bey.

01:30:32.458 --> 01:30:38.924
And now raise your hand if you want to see
Ertugrul Bey as the new Bey.

01:30:56.758 --> 01:30:59.924
For the seigniory position of the Kayi
tribe

01:31:01.024 --> 01:31:07.191
ten men chose Gundogdu Bey and
six men chose Ertugrul Bey.

01:31:09.358 --> 01:31:12.258
So the new Kayi nomad tent Bey is
Gundogdu Bey.

01:31:18.458 --> 01:31:19.991
Good luck with it.

01:31:39.258 --> 01:31:44.224
-May God bless your seigniory.
-Amen.

01:31:45.058 --> 01:31:49.091
-May you become a fair Bey.
-Amen.

01:31:49.858 --> 01:31:52.324
-Amen.
-May God empower his will.

01:31:52.524 --> 01:31:53.858
Amen.

01:31:54.424 --> 01:31:57.524
-May God help him with his management.
-Amen.

01:31:58.824 --> 01:32:01.358
-May God give him strength to do right.
-Amen.

01:32:02.324 --> 01:32:05.891
May his seigniory and his marquee be
close to his people.

01:32:05.958 --> 01:32:07.091
Amen.

01:32:07.491 --> 01:32:14.458
May God help his marquee and his nomad
tent be victorious at all times.

01:32:15.191 --> 01:32:16.358
Amen.

01:32:18.924 --> 01:32:22.124
The honorable and wise Beys of my
nomad tent.

01:32:22.958 --> 01:32:28.324
You have shown your undoutful perception
with you the decision you've made.

01:32:28.924 --> 01:32:32.158
May God bless each and every one of you.

01:32:33.091 --> 01:32:36.258
My marquee will be a marquee of service

01:32:36.391 --> 01:32:39.891
as it used to be during Suleyman Shah's
reign.

01:32:40.124 --> 01:32:43.491
From now on the pleasure is ours and the
rigor is mine.

01:32:44.124 --> 01:32:47.824
Your sorrow is mine, your troubles are
mine.

01:32:48.324 --> 01:32:51.991
You know that I will work for
at all times.

01:32:52.458 --> 01:32:55.091
Also, everyone must also know that

01:32:55.791 --> 01:33:00.791
whoever wants to divide our marquee
and whoever causes disunion

01:33:01.158 --> 01:33:06.324
that person shall be treated in line with
our traditions.

01:33:08.158 --> 01:33:13.024
May God grant us a permanent union and
peace.

01:33:13.291 --> 01:33:14.391
Amen.

01:33:46.458 --> 01:33:48.091
Bismillah...

01:33:56.558 --> 01:33:58.291
Bismillah...

01:33:59.558 --> 01:34:01.024
Bismillah...

01:34:16.758 --> 01:34:18.058
Good luck with it, brother.

01:34:20.424 --> 01:34:21.858
You should know that

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:27.424
resorting to our enemies' dirty games
whom we fight agains for the seigniory

01:34:28.291 --> 01:34:32.091
has destoryed the Kayi marquee and the
nomad group from inside out.

01:34:33.791 --> 01:34:37.458
Falling back on illegal ways for
the seigniory

01:34:38.291 --> 01:34:42.191
has enabled our enemies to invade our
nomad tent.

01:34:45.824 --> 01:34:49.958
I hope that your perception will continue
to guide you from now on.

01:34:51.824 --> 01:34:53.891
I can no longer stay at this nomad tent.

01:34:54.924 --> 01:34:57.524
Enjoy your new Bey.

01:35:01.891 --> 01:35:07.258
What I need to do is leave with a handful
of people who believe in me.

01:35:10.558 --> 01:35:15.224
You could not become a Bey in your
own tribe. Where will you go, Ertugrul?

01:35:16.158 --> 01:35:18.791
You will be the death of those handful of
miserable people.

01:35:21.258 --> 01:35:24.558
Just like the Prophet Ibrahim, who is a
whole ummah by himself

01:35:24.991 --> 01:35:28.158
I will take to the road like him and I
will establish a state with these people.

01:35:32.424 --> 01:35:33.958
Keep that in mind.

01:35:53.358 --> 01:35:54.524
Good luck with it.

01:36:01.391 --> 01:36:02.524
Good luck with it.

01:36:07.158 --> 01:36:08.391
Good luck with it.

01:36:34.158 --> 01:36:36.058
Everyone should know that

01:36:36.491 --> 01:36:40.791
Suleyman Shah's son Gundogdu Bey is
the new Bey of the Kayi nomad group.

01:36:41.024 --> 01:36:42.224
Good luck with it.

01:36:44.291 --> 01:36:46.058
Hear ye! Hear ye!

01:36:46.258 --> 01:36:50.158
Suleyman Shah's son Gundogdu Bey is
the new Bey of the Kayi nomad group.

01:36:52.158 --> 01:36:53.924
Hear ye! Hear ye!

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:57.891
Suleyman Shah's son Gundogdu Bey is
the new Bey of the Kayi nomad group.

01:36:58.124 --> 01:36:59.491
Good luck with it.

01:37:00.091 --> 01:37:01.958
Hear ye! Hear ye!

01:37:02.058 --> 01:37:06.124
Suleyman Shah's son Gundogdu Bey is
the new Bey of the Kayi nomad group.

01:37:07.458 --> 01:37:09.424
Hear ye! Hear ye!

01:37:09.824 --> 01:37:13.758
Suleyman Shah's son Gundogdu Bey is
the new Bey of the Kayi nomad group.

01:37:15.491 --> 01:37:17.324
Hear ye! Hear ye!

01:37:17.558 --> 01:37:21.524
Suleyman Shah's son Gundogdu Bey is
the new Bey of the Kayi nomad group.

01:37:23.291 --> 01:37:25.158
Hear ye! Hear ye!

01:37:25.291 --> 01:37:29.124
Suleyman Shah's son Gundogdu Bey is
the new Bey of the Kayi nomad group.

01:37:32.891 --> 01:37:34.491
Hear ye! Hear ye!

01:37:34.824 --> 01:37:38.858
Suleyman Shah's son Gundogdu Bey is
the new Bey of the Kayi nomad group.

01:37:39.224 --> 01:37:42.558
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:46.158
Tomorrow we will leave this place with
the ones who believe in us.

01:37:48.058 --> 01:37:51.124
Tell everyone. It's high time we leave.

01:38:00.124 --> 01:38:02.824
Do not be upset, do not be disappointed.

01:38:03.991 --> 01:38:06.924
Big victories are won with small defeats.

01:38:07.991 --> 01:38:10.458
Even your defeat is a victory, son.

01:38:11.524 --> 01:38:14.924
Do not forget that the defeater on this
road is the victor.

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:19.991
Our God says "You are ruled as you live."

01:38:20.924 --> 01:38:23.991
Indeed, God knows what is best.

01:38:28.324 --> 01:38:30.991
Let us take a walk. I need to talk to you.

01:38:42.758 --> 01:38:44.991
I have been waiting for this day for
a long time, brother.

01:38:45.391 --> 01:38:47.758
But I do not know whether I should be
happy or not.

01:38:50.058 --> 01:38:54.124
So it was our fate to leave the brothers
that we fought together

01:38:54.258 --> 01:38:58.991
we sat at the same table together,
we shared a dream together.

01:39:02.024 --> 01:39:04.124
We are very upset but...

01:39:06.124 --> 01:39:08.324
...everyone lives their own destiny,
brother.

01:39:08.924 --> 01:39:10.491
Everyone lives their own destiny.

01:39:48.558 --> 01:39:52.124
If it will reminds you of who you are and
where you come from

01:39:52.524 --> 01:39:56.358
if it reminds you that you are the son of
Suleyman Shah, you can take my life.

01:40:04.924 --> 01:40:06.291
Do you remember now, brother?

01:40:08.891 --> 01:40:10.158
I remember.

01:40:15.324 --> 01:40:17.191
You remind me of who I am.

01:40:19.891 --> 01:40:23.324
You deceived our father and dragged us
into a disaster.

01:40:58.391 --> 01:40:59.791
God!

01:41:02.091 --> 01:41:04.191
Do not make me forget who I am.

01:41:06.291 --> 01:41:09.158
Keep me on Suleyman Shah's path.

01:41:10.391 --> 01:41:13.891
Protect our unity and peace.

01:42:33.424 --> 01:42:38.758
<i>Aykiz, Father Demir, I swore</i>
 <i>I would keep my promise I made you.</i>

01:42:39.058 --> 01:42:40.924
<i>I will take your revenge.</i>

01:42:43.491 --> 01:42:49.891
<i>I am going to kill that man who caused</i>
 <i>trouble to my people and Ertugrul Bey.</i>

01:43:24.991 --> 01:43:26.558
I killed Baycu Noyan

01:43:27.024 --> 01:43:31.424
who killed our people that were our flesh
and blood.

01:43:34.291 --> 01:43:37.491
It will be more difficult for us when the
great Mongols army arrive.

01:43:38.524 --> 01:43:41.824
So, you have to immigrate

01:43:42.791 --> 01:43:46.158
and to set up a nomad tent where Muslims
can be safe.

01:43:49.891 --> 01:43:53.124
More trouble arises in peaceful lands.

01:43:53.391 --> 01:43:56.291
Just like the the first Muslims did many
centuries ago.

01:44:01.791 --> 01:44:06.024
Mecca's polytheists were tyrannizing the
Muslims.

01:44:06.558 --> 01:44:11.991
They tortured to them and made their lives
miserable.

01:44:12.824 --> 01:44:17.758
They seized the goods of the Muslims
and they insulted them in every way.

01:44:19.358 --> 01:44:23.824
This situation became unbearable for a
handful of the Muslims.

01:44:25.458 --> 01:44:29.224
Muslims came to our master and
complained about to this situation.

01:44:30.791 --> 01:44:33.024
After our master listened to them

01:44:33.291 --> 01:44:36.858
he told them to immigrate to Yesrib,
I mean Medina.

01:44:39.058 --> 01:44:44.224
Thereupon, Muslims started preparations
for the immigration to Medina.

01:44:46.324 --> 01:44:49.291
However, some polytheists tried to stop
them.

01:44:50.491 --> 01:44:52.458
They threatened to kill them.

01:44:53.358 --> 01:44:56.991
They torture them in every way imagnable
to prevent them from immigrating.

01:44:58.791 --> 01:45:03.191
Muslims took the road with despite these
difficulties and immigrated.

01:45:04.291 --> 01:45:10.358
Giving up their brothers, wives, mothers
and their goods and possessions...

01:45:10.524 --> 01:45:14.158
They took the road by giving up eveything
they had.

01:45:16.891 --> 01:45:19.824
At the end of this blessed journey they
arrived at Medina.

01:45:20.491 --> 01:45:23.291
And they established the Islamic state of
Medina there.

01:45:23.858 --> 01:45:26.991
They take it upon themselves to save
humanity.

01:45:28.191 --> 01:45:32.491
The Islamic state expanded its territories
in no time.

01:45:33.358 --> 01:45:36.991
Thanks to their immigration mankind
reached salvation.

01:45:38.324 --> 01:45:40.391
This is the purpose of all immigrations.

01:45:41.258 --> 01:45:46.224
Immigration is starting over when
eveything seems to be over, son.

01:45:47.458 --> 01:45:52.258
Don't forget that this journey to take you
to your destination, not an escape.

01:45:54.524 --> 01:45:57.058
Humankind is arefugee in this world.

01:45:57.491 --> 01:46:01.424
Your immigration has to be an immigration
for the salvation of all mankind.

01:46:01.891 --> 01:46:04.191
I hope, God helps you.

01:46:05.358 --> 01:46:06.458
Amen.

01:46:10.858 --> 01:46:13.758
I hope, God always keeps me

01:46:14.024 --> 01:46:18.024
and my generation as the guardians of
this cause.

01:46:18.091 --> 01:46:19.091
Amen.

01:46:20.024 --> 01:46:22.491
May He let us live by the principles of
the holy immigration.

01:46:33.324 --> 01:46:35.491
I will leave for Ahlat as soon as
possible.

01:46:36.224 --> 01:46:38.524
I will choose a place where we can
find peace.

01:46:39.258 --> 01:46:41.558
In the meantime, get on with your
preparations.

01:46:41.858 --> 01:46:43.358
Make sure that we are not short of
anything.

01:46:43.791 --> 01:46:45.191
Your wish is my command, Bey.

01:46:47.024 --> 01:46:48.124
Excuse me, Bey.

01:46:48.858 --> 01:46:50.058
Please, you can go.

01:47:02.291 --> 01:47:03.358
Brother...

01:47:04.991 --> 01:47:06.491
...what will happen to Ertugrul?

01:47:12.524 --> 01:47:15.791
I understand your pain, Mother.

01:47:17.258 --> 01:47:19.491
However, my brother is misguided.

01:47:24.458 --> 01:47:26.891
Tonight I will host a banquet in
my marquee.

01:47:27.291 --> 01:47:30.958
I will invite Halime Sultan and Ertugrul.
Not to worry.

01:47:31.458 --> 01:47:32.958
As the Bey of this nomad group

01:47:33.091 --> 01:47:36.158
I will try my best to persuade him to
give up on his obstinacy.

01:47:44.558 --> 01:47:45.924
He will not come.

01:47:47.191 --> 01:47:50.124
-He will not come for his stubbornness.
-He will come!

01:47:52.824 --> 01:47:54.858
Because it is time for separation.

01:47:55.024 --> 01:47:58.291
He will come to the table where his
brothers and his mother are dining.

01:47:59.391 --> 01:48:02.391
This might be the last time I see
my children, my daughter-in-laws

01:48:02.491 --> 01:48:04.558
and my grand children together.

01:48:05.024 --> 01:48:07.491
He will come to our dinner table.

01:48:28.758 --> 01:48:30.758
Where have you been, Ertugrul?
I was worried about you.

01:48:59.324 --> 01:49:02.024
You once asked "What if you cannot
become the Bey of the tribe", Halime...

01:49:04.991 --> 01:49:06.124
I've lost the elections.

01:49:09.958 --> 01:49:14.924
But this loss will be the beginning of
various triumphs.

01:49:24.358 --> 01:49:29.958
I feel comfortable.
There are no accounts I cannot give.

01:49:31.791 --> 01:49:33.058
That is right, Ertugrul.

01:49:34.258 --> 01:49:37.191
The seigniory will not bless us in our
blessed battle.

01:49:37.924 --> 01:49:41.024
Are we supposed to give up on our dreams
because you didn't become the Bey.

01:49:43.224 --> 01:49:45.158
It does not matter that you lost the
elections.

01:49:46.991 --> 01:49:51.158
There are innumerable people who see
the redemption in your eyes.

01:49:54.124 --> 01:49:57.324
At the beginning, we said "If it was
necessary we can go on our own."

01:50:01.091 --> 01:50:03.258
I saw the fire in the Alps' eyes, Halime.

01:50:04.858 --> 01:50:07.124
I saw that hope in the faces of the kids.

01:50:10.958 --> 01:50:14.324
Now I know that we will not be alone.

01:50:16.924 --> 01:50:18.424
Start your preparations right away.

01:50:20.091 --> 01:50:24.291
Tomorrow we will go with our people

01:50:24.958 --> 01:50:28.224
who trust and believe in us.

01:50:30.958 --> 01:50:32.891
We will make our dreams come true.

01:50:36.458 --> 01:50:40.191
We will leave this place honorably.

01:50:41.858 --> 01:50:44.124
May God grant you a long life with us,
Ertugrul.

01:50:45.524 --> 01:50:50.024
You've become the hope for the desperate
and have become spark who lost their fire.

01:50:51.458 --> 01:50:53.558
You woke up the hearts who
had fallen asleep.

01:50:59.058 --> 01:51:00.924
May God be with us, Halime Sultan.

01:51:12.058 --> 01:51:14.291
Ertugrul Bey, I want to say something.

01:51:16.191 --> 01:51:18.358
Gundogdu Bey is hosting a banquet.

01:51:19.891 --> 01:51:21.891
He has invites us, too.

01:51:24.891 --> 01:51:26.858
There would be no peace there anymore.

01:51:29.124 --> 01:51:34.224
Ertugrul, your mother will be looking
forward to seeing you.

01:51:34.858 --> 01:51:37.324
Maybe it will the the last time she will
ever see her daughter-in-laws

01:51:37.458 --> 01:51:39.258
her grandchild and her children together.

01:51:39.324 --> 01:51:40.924
Do not disappoint her.

01:51:42.524 --> 01:51:44.791
Do not break her heart over this.

01:52:16.046 --> 01:52:17.946
Ertugrul will not come, Mother.

01:52:24.346 --> 01:52:25.879
Ertugrul brother will come.

01:52:27.412 --> 01:52:29.379
He would not leave my mother alone
on his last night.

01:52:44.346 --> 01:52:45.346
Peace be upon you.

01:52:46.112 --> 01:52:47.479
And peace be upon you.

01:52:53.512 --> 01:52:55.012
Come and sit, my son.

01:53:09.446 --> 01:53:11.379
Bismillah...

01:53:37.012 --> 01:53:38.679
This is the last bread...

01:53:40.579 --> 01:53:43.579
...we share among ourselves.

01:53:55.479 --> 01:53:59.012
I wanted to be together for the last time

01:54:00.346 --> 01:54:04.745
with those who have lived in Suleyman
Shah's marquee.

01:54:12.679 --> 01:54:14.679
If Gundogdu Bey lets me...

01:54:17.479 --> 01:54:19.679
...I wish to express my problem...

01:54:20.912 --> 01:54:23.446
...and keep my children together.

01:54:23.812 --> 01:54:25.046
Do not mention it, mother.

01:54:28.579 --> 01:54:33.012
We spend our life combating and
suffering.

01:54:34.979 --> 01:54:36.912
But none of them...

01:54:38.479 --> 01:54:42.779
...hurt me as much as Sungurtekin's
pain hurt me.

01:54:46.546 --> 01:54:47.612
Now...

01:54:50.546 --> 01:54:52.412
...two of my sons...

01:54:55.479 --> 01:54:59.746
...will go from my nomad tent and
marquee.

01:55:05.812 --> 01:55:08.646
The land which we will travel to will
become the future of the Oghuz Tribe.

01:55:11.046 --> 01:55:15.579
We'll leave Suleyman Shah's noble
marquee, just like seeds

01:55:15.679 --> 01:55:17.346
blow away when it's their time.

01:55:20.979 --> 01:55:24.679
We will plant Kayi's flag to the farthest
ranges we can reach.

01:55:26.846 --> 01:55:29.612
It is like the day we headed out of our
ancestral territory.

01:55:31.512 --> 01:55:35.646
Our range will be the land where the sun
goes down.

01:55:37.812 --> 01:55:40.779
We will not let down Islam and Oghuz's
flag, mother.

01:55:42.379 --> 01:55:45.046
We will not let rainy days hinder my
father's marquee.

01:55:49.012 --> 01:55:54.079
You should know, this is not only my
way, but also the Kayi's fate.

01:56:00.146 --> 01:56:03.779
How many people do you think will
accompany you, Ertugrul?

01:56:09.112 --> 01:56:12.646
How many miserable people will fall to
your temptations?

01:56:15.546 --> 01:56:17.712
Above all, when you are in such
trouble...

01:56:31.912 --> 01:56:34.512
So Ertugrul is marching towards his
death then?

01:56:34.779 --> 01:56:39.112
As you ordered, my men will be waiting
for them on the way, Ameer.

01:56:40.712 --> 01:56:47.579
You're nothing but a small-time with a
handful of looters, right Ertugrul?

01:56:50.879 --> 01:56:52.512
You should complete this task,
Doruk Bey.

01:56:52.979 --> 01:56:55.346
Whoever is next to him, kill them all.

01:56:55.479 --> 01:56:57.346
I want you to kill his wife,
his children...

01:56:58.912 --> 01:57:00.712
...even his horses.

01:57:04.579 --> 01:57:06.012
I want to be done and over with it.

01:57:08.712 --> 01:57:10.979
Your wish is my command, Ameer
Highness.

01:57:13.446 --> 01:57:16.779
When you go to the battle, take Bogac
with you. He will help you.

01:57:17.679 --> 01:57:19.846
After you complete your task, kill him,
too

01:57:22.479 --> 01:57:26.879
Sadettin Kobek never forgives
betrayers.

01:57:29.846 --> 01:57:32.046
Your wish is my command, Ameer
Majesty.

01:57:51.579 --> 01:57:52.912
Don't do that, Ertugrul.

01:57:54.512 --> 01:57:56.112
Back down before it's too late.

01:57:58.012 --> 01:58:01.346
Everyone knows you are the greatest
of Alps among the Kayis.

01:58:02.512 --> 01:58:03.846
And everyone appreciates you.

01:58:07.679 --> 01:58:11.379
If you go, your absence will upset
all of us.

01:58:15.579 --> 01:58:17.779
You will come to nothing, Ertugrul.

01:58:22.746 --> 01:58:24.879
You, your Alps...

01:58:26.112 --> 01:58:30.646
...and the women that follow you
will lose.

01:58:33.512 --> 01:58:34.879
You will all die.

01:58:39.812 --> 01:58:42.046
The battle is not lost when you die.

01:58:43.146 --> 01:58:46.846
The battle is lost when we become like
enemies.

01:58:49.679 --> 01:58:54.846
I see that you have already become
the enemies that I battled against.

01:59:01.046 --> 01:59:03.446
By trying to strangle an innocent child...

01:59:06.712 --> 01:59:09.746
...and by bribing Beys in the tribe
with gold...

01:59:14.012 --> 01:59:15.746
...you have already showed me that
you're the enemy.

01:59:15.812 --> 01:59:18.812
-Ertugrul!
-Say no more!

01:59:31.912 --> 01:59:33.679
After all that's happened...

01:59:35.079 --> 01:59:37.579
...how can I ask you to stay, son?

01:59:43.746 --> 01:59:44.946
If I tell you to leave...

01:59:47.779 --> 01:59:50.679
...how can my heart bear it?

02:00:00.112 --> 02:00:01.912
So, in this world...

02:00:04.746 --> 02:00:07.479
...we were meant to live in purgatory.

02:00:09.546 --> 02:00:13.646
I've run out of words and patience,
Mother.

02:00:18.512 --> 02:00:22.846
May God help the ones who stay or
leave.

02:00:23.979 --> 02:00:24.979
Amen.

02:00:27.079 --> 02:00:29.846
Ertugrul, give up the Shahzada Yigit
to the Sultan.

02:00:32.946 --> 02:00:36.546
Otherwise you will share the same
destiny.

02:00:38.346 --> 02:00:39.879
Do not forget this.

02:00:43.079 --> 02:00:45.979
I have always believed in the justice of
our Sultan.

02:00:48.146 --> 02:00:50.946
I will do whatever is needed.
Do not worry.

02:00:57.812 --> 02:00:58.979
With your permission.

02:01:15.612 --> 02:01:16.712
Halime.

02:01:33.046 --> 02:01:34.679
Excuse me, Mother.

02:02:29.446 --> 02:02:32.612
I will leave for Ahlat tomorrow.

02:02:34.546 --> 02:02:35.846
It will be a long journey.

02:02:36.879 --> 02:02:38.579
I'd better rest for a while.

02:03:08.446 --> 02:03:13.612
This spoon has been waiting for you
since the day you were captured.

02:03:13.879 --> 02:03:18.579
Even when we gave up our hope,
my mother never gave up.

02:03:20.612 --> 02:03:21.712
My dear mother...

02:04:29.446 --> 02:04:34.379
<i>Esselamu aleykum ve rahmetullah.</i>

02:04:35.612 --> 02:04:36.812
Amen.

02:04:38.112 --> 02:04:39.579
Almighty God..

02:04:40.812 --> 02:04:47.046
There might be evilest in fortune we see
and goodness in the evilest.

02:04:48.746 --> 02:04:51.112
Bless us with the good ones, God.

02:04:52.579 --> 02:04:54.079
Expel the evilest.

02:04:55.446 --> 02:04:57.879
Give us to good things.

02:04:59.579 --> 02:05:01.512
Do not withdraw your support from us.

02:05:02.679 --> 02:05:04.512
Do not let us become helpless.

02:05:06.479 --> 02:05:10.446
Bless us with good luck and expand our
perception.

02:05:11.079 --> 02:05:15.379
Protect them from heading towards a
disaster with the decisions they made.

02:05:16.479 --> 02:05:18.379
Protect from falling into disuse.

02:05:19.879 --> 02:05:22.112
Help them follow the right path.

02:05:23.112 --> 02:05:26.679
Let us live whatever is good for us.

02:05:27.546 --> 02:05:31.712
Certainly, it is You who knows the best...

02:05:33.412 --> 02:05:35.612
...and it is you who predestines the best
for us.

02:05:37.979 --> 02:05:39.146
Amen.

02:06:10.679 --> 02:06:12.379
Do not get upset, Hatun.

02:06:13.412 --> 02:06:14.912
We did not do anything wrong.

02:06:15.846 --> 02:06:17.979
We saved our nomad tent from
a disaster.

02:06:19.446 --> 02:06:20.779
It was not so, Bey.

02:06:22.346 --> 02:06:25.779
It is very difficult to withstand

02:06:26.346 --> 02:06:29.912
the pain of separation from Halime
Sultan, Ertugrul Bey

02:06:31.112 --> 02:06:33.379
Dundar, and Gunduz.

02:06:34.746 --> 02:06:38.546
Stay strong, Hatun.
We do the best we could do.

02:06:44.012 --> 02:06:45.046
Gundogdu...

02:06:48.979 --> 02:06:50.679
Is there no other way?

02:06:53.612 --> 02:06:59.445
If you act nobly and tell him to stay,
he might change his mind, right?

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:04.079
For my sake, Bey. Give it a try
one last time.

02:07:17.146 --> 02:07:18.646
Give my head scarf.

02:07:22.979 --> 02:07:24.346
Alright.

02:07:27.546 --> 02:07:28.646
Let me talk to him.

02:07:46.646 --> 02:07:50.079
Go and see which Alps will come with
us and

02:07:50.579 --> 02:07:52.446
how many people will accompany us
on our way.

02:07:52.979 --> 02:07:55.612
-Your wish is my command, Bey.
-We will try every single tent, Bey.

02:07:55.779 --> 02:07:56.912
Thank you.

02:08:00.612 --> 02:08:03.546
You should go and talk to the women.

02:08:04.112 --> 02:08:06.512
Not to worry, Bey. I'll take care of it.

02:08:07.746 --> 02:08:11.712
If need be, we'll take the road with a
handful of people, as soon as possible.

02:08:39.579 --> 02:08:41.579
I will leave for Ahlat for a new homeland.

02:08:48.546 --> 02:08:51.079
I wanted to talk you before I go.

02:08:56.679 --> 02:08:58.779
I'm not talking to you as the Bey
of the tribe.

02:09:00.012 --> 02:09:04.046
I'm not having this conversation because
I don't want to lose an Alp like you.

02:09:06.379 --> 02:09:08.679
I just wanted to tell my beloved
brother...

02:09:11.546 --> 02:09:13.912
...to stay here.

02:09:18.746 --> 02:09:20.046
It is too late now, brother.

02:09:24.946 --> 02:09:26.612
Please do not do this, brother.

02:09:28.612 --> 02:09:32.412
So not leave me, Sungur, or our mother.

02:09:34.512 --> 02:09:35.912
We grew up together.

02:09:38.412 --> 02:09:39.512
Our children...

02:09:41.446 --> 02:09:43.979
...our dreams, our hopes will grow
together.

02:09:44.346 --> 02:09:45.946
Stop with this stubbornness.

02:09:50.379 --> 02:09:54.979
We have no common dreams,
no common hopes, brother.

02:09:58.379 --> 02:10:01.779
You relied on the murderer who killed
Korkut Bey,

02:10:01.912 --> 02:10:06.012
Tugtekin Bey and Gokche Hatun,
not me.

02:10:09.346 --> 02:10:13.679
While I was struggling with that man,
what have you done?

02:10:15.112 --> 02:10:17.412
You supported him against me.

02:10:19.612 --> 02:10:22.412
You kept silent at all of the seditions
in my father's tent.

02:10:25.579 --> 02:10:29.412
You gave gold to Beys just to become
a Bey.

02:10:32.912 --> 02:10:35.812
You broke all our hopes and dreams.

02:10:37.612 --> 02:10:43.712
Whatever determined our identity was
ripped away without consideration.

02:10:46.346 --> 02:10:47.579
I see that...

02:10:48.412 --> 02:10:50.546
...every cause I lead is a burden for you.

02:10:53.712 --> 02:10:57.412
There is nothing more left to us than to

02:10:58.712 --> 02:11:00.979
find solace remembering those
memories.

02:11:04.479 --> 02:11:05.946
May God help you.

02:11:32.879 --> 02:11:34.012
Brother?

02:12:04.979 --> 02:12:07.912
-Give your blessing, brother.
-You have my blessing, brother.

02:12:08.646 --> 02:12:11.479
Give your blessing, too.

02:12:12.979 --> 02:12:14.112
You have my blessing.
