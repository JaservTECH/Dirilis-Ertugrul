00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 43 will start after 12:18 min.

12:18.638 --> 12:22.638
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:24.103 --> 12:27.769
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:28.236 --> 12:31.236
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:07.645 --> 13:08.678
What is happening, Hayme?

13:09.078 --> 13:12.011
It is time to face with Noyan, brother.

13:14.645 --> 13:17.011
I called you to listen to my sons.

13:20.811 --> 13:22.011
As my mother said

13:23.578 --> 13:26.711
it is time to take life of our enemy.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.611
How is it going to happen, Ertugrul?

13:35.245 --> 13:37.578
We are not talking about some bandits.

13:38.045 --> 13:41.545
We are talking about the vanguard composed
of the most valiant Alps of Mongolians.

13:42.945 --> 13:44.745
I hope you thought long and hard.

13:46.245 --> 13:50.845
Ertugrul Bey I know,
would not call us here

13:51.545 --> 13:54.945
without talking to our best Alp
and talk about it, Gumustekin Bey.

13:56.945 --> 14:01.778
Noyan waits in Kurtbogazi
to make a trap to me.

14:03.178 --> 14:04.945
How did you learn it, Ertugrul Bey?

14:08.111 --> 14:10.111
The person you know
as betrayer Abdurrahman.

14:12.278 --> 14:14.111
I was the one who kidnapped him
from fenced tent.

14:17.145 --> 14:20.078
Ertugrul, every sing...

14:20.245 --> 14:25.778
I exuded Abdurrahman from fenced tent
and placed him near to cur Noyan.

14:30.578 --> 14:34.545
I have done the thing that our enemies
have made to us for a thousand of year.

14:36.678 --> 14:39.311
Was Abdurrahman your spy?

14:44.878 --> 14:48.778
While his brothers
try to make him executed

14:49.645 --> 14:52.778
he did not consider of a dilemma not
to give his life for his brothers.

14:55.911 --> 15:00.111
But, now life of Abdurrahman Alp
is in danger.

15:01.978 --> 15:05.011
We want to take the action
before he loses his life.

15:14.011 --> 15:20.811
Noyan will locate his man to valley
of Kurtbogazi in order to ambush me.

15:22.278 --> 15:27.878
We will move to upper part
of valley on foot.

15:29.078 --> 15:32.945
While they wait for me to come
we will attack from upward.

15:35.645 --> 15:36.745
They could not even breathe.

15:39.911 --> 15:41.745
Tangut will be with Noyan.

15:43.011 --> 15:47.111
So while we attack

15:47.845 --> 15:50.111
we need to move with our best Alps.

15:52.845 --> 15:54.278
Me and my Alps will be with you...

15:57.811 --> 15:59.011
...Ertugrul Bey.

16:03.611 --> 16:04.911
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey.

16:10.145 --> 16:12.311
Cantonment of Noyan is not an easy mark.

16:16.045 --> 16:19.145
What our head Alp, Gundogdu Bey, says?

16:23.845 --> 16:25.645
If my Beys agree

16:26.845 --> 16:30.178
I want to make the Anatolian mountains
unbearable for them.

16:39.111 --> 16:40.245
Now

16:42.311 --> 16:46.611
this is the place where Noyan made
a trap to my brother.

16:48.011 --> 16:50.345
They did all malice here.

16:52.711 --> 16:55.945
They have three crucial unions here.

16:57.578 --> 17:01.311
We will move from stream bed with our Alps

17:02.578 --> 17:07.878
and then we will move from this stream bed

17:08.278 --> 17:10.611
to the heart of their cantonment.

17:17.678 --> 17:19.245
Mongolians know how to attack very well.

17:20.978 --> 17:22.911
However, their defense is weak.

17:24.711 --> 17:29.711
They are blind from the glory of
formerly gained victories

17:32.345 --> 17:34.045
the thing I am trying to say is

17:34.345 --> 17:38.578
if we success to enter to cantonment
of Noyan unexpectedly

17:38.778 --> 17:42.811
they will not have any power
to fight against us.

17:45.011 --> 17:47.711
If Korkut Bey let me,
I would like to join to this war.

17:50.811 --> 17:52.245
God bless our holly war.

17:53.978 --> 17:55.078
Thank you, my Bey.

17:56.778 --> 17:58.945
Situation of your leg is obvious,
Gumustekin Bey.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.145
It is better if you do not go.

18:03.545 --> 18:05.045
Drowsing does not look good on me

18:05.245 --> 18:07.311
while attacking to dishonest men
with our Alps, Artuk Bey.

18:08.945 --> 18:12.578
Being martyr with my groom that I vestry
my daughter is an honor to me.

18:13.345 --> 18:14.578
Thank you, Bey.

18:17.878 --> 18:21.211
Now, things spoken here

18:22.678 --> 18:23.811
will remain here.

18:25.611 --> 18:27.245
If there is another betrayer shows up

18:28.345 --> 18:29.778
then we will know that

18:30.878 --> 18:33.278
he is from this marquee.

18:35.311 --> 18:37.978
May God be with you.

18:38.811 --> 18:40.278
-Amen.
-Amen.

18:40.711 --> 18:41.811
-Amen.
-Amen.

20:24.645 --> 20:25.745
What do you see, Ulubilge?

20:27.745 --> 20:28.811
Tell me what you saw?

20:49.611 --> 20:50.645
Tell me!

20:51.145 --> 20:53.011
-Ertugrul!
-What about him?

20:55.545 --> 20:56.645
Ertugrul...

20:57.845 --> 21:00.211
Ertugrul was an eagle with broken wings.

21:03.278 --> 21:06.878
Now he has wings stronger than each other.

21:08.345 --> 21:11.311
With these wings
he will be flying over you.

21:12.645 --> 21:13.945
He will be a trouble to you!

21:15.711 --> 21:16.711
Until...

21:21.345 --> 21:22.678
Until what?

21:25.111 --> 21:26.111
Tell me!

21:30.278 --> 21:31.345
Ertugrul...

21:32.611 --> 21:33.811
Until Ertugrul dies

21:34.778 --> 21:36.311
there is no victory to you, Noyan.

22:48.024 --> 22:49.157
Peace be upon you.

22:49.257 --> 22:50.791
And peace be upon you.

23:16.591 --> 23:18.924
<i>Where are so many Alps going?</i>

23:19.857 --> 23:21.557
<i>They must be up to something!</i>

24:28.191 --> 24:31.924
There is no pus left in your leg, Bey.

24:34.791 --> 24:37.924
But you should rest, it is not wise...

24:38.157 --> 24:40.991
...to go to war in this condition.

24:44.357 --> 24:47.257
If I am not going, who will, Artuk Bey?

24:48.257 --> 24:50.357
Even if death is the price...

24:52.857 --> 24:55.791
...I will attack to those
Mongolian bastards.

24:56.457 --> 25:00.924
Both as a Bey of the nomad group
and as a person authorized by the state...

25:00.991 --> 25:03.257
...I will need to fight in this war.

25:13.324 --> 25:15.491
May God help you, Bey.

25:34.357 --> 25:37.157
What is going on?
Where are all these Alps going to?

25:37.257 --> 25:39.291
We do not know, Bey.
Excuse me.

25:43.957 --> 25:45.957
Good gracious!

25:48.491 --> 25:50.857
What are they up to again?

26:10.057 --> 26:12.957
Welcome, Halime Sultan,
welcome, Grandfather Demir.

26:13.057 --> 26:15.291
-Thank you, beauty.
-Thank you.

26:15.424 --> 26:17.391
God save you to your parents.

26:17.857 --> 26:19.957
Has anything important
happened in the nomad group...

26:20.024 --> 26:21.524
...while we were away?

26:21.891 --> 26:25.124
Ertugrul Bey cleaned the nomad group
from betrayers, Bey.

26:25.524 --> 26:27.824
-Is Ertugrul Bey in the nomad group?
-Yes he is.

26:30.191 --> 26:31.524
Come on.

26:51.224 --> 26:53.391
-Halime!
-Ertugrul!

27:09.524 --> 27:12.457
Thanks God you are back home.

27:16.291 --> 27:18.891
I was not away from my home
even for a single day.

27:20.557 --> 27:23.591
I am at home,
and my home is inside me.

27:28.024 --> 27:30.057
And you are on the seat of honor.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.191
Separation awaits us again, Ertugrul.

27:47.224 --> 27:51.857
We united with the Dodurgas.
We are going to war, Halime Sultan.

27:53.457 --> 27:57.191
We will make Noyan fall into his own trap.

27:59.391 --> 28:02.091
But I say Sungurtekin, Ertugrul.

28:04.991 --> 28:06.857
Sungurtekin Bey sent you a message...

28:07.491 --> 28:10.191
...he will wait for you
in the caravansary tonight.

28:10.957 --> 28:13.124
He told you to come no matter what.

28:40.091 --> 28:41.257
We are ready, Noyan.

28:41.491 --> 28:43.091
Let us go, then.

28:46.157 --> 28:47.424
Noyan!

29:12.857 --> 29:14.457
Is it bad news, Noyan?

29:15.357 --> 29:20.057
Sadettin Kobek
sent me news with Sungurtekin.

29:21.157 --> 29:23.357
He will be in the caravansary tonight.

29:25.457 --> 29:27.091
What about Ertugrul?

29:28.924 --> 29:33.257
Sungurtekin is going to kill Ogeday
by the order of Aleaddin.

29:33.924 --> 29:35.257
I need to stop him.

29:39.424 --> 29:41.291
Ertugrul will die, Tangut.

29:42.291 --> 29:43.824
This is your duty.

29:44.257 --> 29:46.257
Do not ever disappoint me.

29:46.957 --> 29:48.457
Yes, Noyan!

29:48.524 --> 29:50.057
Prepare my horse.

29:57.157 --> 30:00.324
Finally Ertugrul fell into my hands.

30:32.257 --> 30:36.091
May God speed you and help you, my Bey.

30:36.824 --> 30:38.524
Thank you, Gokce Hatun.

30:40.024 --> 30:41.991
I want to contribute to this victory...

30:42.057 --> 30:44.024
...with tear and blood.

30:44.791 --> 30:47.957
I know that your dreams
are far beyond your father's marquee.

30:50.257 --> 30:52.457
You will prove it in this war.

31:04.557 --> 31:06.957
I hope nothing is wrong, son.

31:08.957 --> 31:12.557
Halime Sultan and Wild Demir brought
you news from Sungurtekin, mother.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.224
Thank God! Tell me, how is he?

31:19.591 --> 31:22.491
You should have seen how
he cut the Mongolians up with the sword...

31:22.557 --> 31:25.457
...I gave him when he was a child.
He was more than alright.

31:25.591 --> 31:28.191
He came so fast and saved our lives.

31:28.491 --> 31:31.124
Master, where is my brother now?

31:31.224 --> 31:33.457
He is waiting in the caravansary
for Ertugrul Bey.

31:34.424 --> 31:38.091
Why does Sungurtekin not come
to nomad tent and call Ertugrul instead?

31:40.324 --> 31:42.357
I will find out when I go there, mother.

31:50.824 --> 31:54.024
Ertugrul, the Alps are ready.

31:54.257 --> 31:55.924
What should we say to the Beys?

31:56.857 --> 32:00.424
Sungurtekin told me to come
no matter what.

32:02.957 --> 32:06.491
You know he would not say that
if he did not need me.

32:07.324 --> 32:08.891
As for Noyan...

32:09.524 --> 32:11.991
...his blood is yours, brother.

32:12.424 --> 32:14.191
May God help you.

32:14.424 --> 32:15.857
Thank you.

32:32.324 --> 32:33.957
May God help you.

32:34.557 --> 32:35.791
Thank you, Bey.

32:35.957 --> 32:37.291
Thank you, Bey.

32:44.791 --> 32:46.824
May God be with you.

32:47.124 --> 32:48.557
Amen.

32:53.591 --> 32:55.557
We are ready, Gundogdu Bey.

32:57.857 --> 33:00.224
Ertugrul is not coming with us.

33:05.991 --> 33:11.224
-Why? He was the one who started this.
-He has a more important duty.

33:14.091 --> 33:17.224
At least as important as the Noyan matter.

33:20.424 --> 33:22.891
Let us go and take their carcasses.

33:44.491 --> 33:46.291
They said you called us, Gundogdu Bey.

33:47.224 --> 33:49.324
Ertugrul Bey is not coming with us.

33:50.157 --> 33:52.224
You are coming with me.

33:54.024 --> 33:56.491
We will meet with the Alps
at the bottom of the valley.

33:56.791 --> 33:58.957
Dumrul will tell you
what you are going to do.

33:59.957 --> 34:01.457
Yes, Bey.

34:03.824 --> 34:06.191
-Thank you, Bey.
-Thank you.

34:14.091 --> 34:15.391
Gundogdu Bey.

34:23.324 --> 34:26.057
I just wanted to say, may God speed you.

34:28.857 --> 34:33.591
May God give you strength, sharpness
to your sword and speed to your horse.

34:34.424 --> 34:35.824
Thank you.

34:55.557 --> 35:00.057
Whenever you see it
remember that I am waiting for you.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.924
I do not need it to remember you.

35:04.857 --> 35:06.857
But thank you anyway.

35:08.391 --> 35:10.057
Goodbye.

36:10.924 --> 36:13.524
Watch your behavior or I will kick you!

36:14.524 --> 36:19.357
Be careful. Lovers kick so hard.

36:19.457 --> 36:22.224
-Yes, brother.
-Damn it!

36:24.791 --> 36:26.891
Brother, where is Ertugrul Bey?

36:28.891 --> 36:30.324
I do not know, brother.

36:31.291 --> 36:35.557
If he does not want us to know,
it is unlawful to us to know about it.

36:38.124 --> 36:40.024
We will accept it as it is.

36:40.124 --> 36:42.391
I know what is going on, brother Turgut.

36:47.591 --> 36:50.891
The doors of the world of secrets
have opened to our Bey.

36:51.824 --> 36:56.524
Only our Bey can enter through this door.
He will be out whenever he wants.

36:56.791 --> 36:59.591
He is in another world now, brother.

37:00.191 --> 37:01.991
He is from another world now.

37:03.424 --> 37:05.924
-Another world?
-Yes, brother.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.357
Oh, come on!

37:22.890 --> 37:23.924
Turgut?

37:24.424 --> 37:25.791
Yes, father.

37:26.357 --> 37:29.157
Let us keep our promise we gave to Aykiz.

37:34.491 --> 37:36.091
Alright, father.

37:41.591 --> 37:43.191
Come on.

37:44.157 --> 37:45.791
Come on.

37:56.191 --> 38:00.024
I could not make you comfortable since
the time I fell in love with you Halime.

38:01.224 --> 38:03.091
You did not have peace ever.

38:04.124 --> 38:07.857
I could not make you live a day
without grief and war.

38:09.091 --> 38:11.457
You gave me your heart.
Is it not enough, Ertugrul?

38:13.291 --> 38:17.457
Do you think I do not know
what you fight for in this short life?

38:19.124 --> 38:24.557
Is your fight not for the peace and unity
of our children and family?

38:28.124 --> 38:31.424
The honor of being with an Alp like you
is enough for me.

39:42.857 --> 39:46.557
I am worried that you go
without healing completely, brother.

39:47.257 --> 39:49.457
I cannot leave this victory
to Ertugrul, Aytolun.

39:51.124 --> 39:53.957
The victory of a war he did not fight in
does not belong to him.

39:54.324 --> 39:56.424
Do you know where he will go?

40:01.057 --> 40:03.857
Then, we cannot be sure of anything.

40:05.024 --> 40:07.091
I hope you will come back with victories.

40:22.124 --> 40:24.391
Come on!

40:53.824 --> 40:54.924
Selcan.

40:55.091 --> 40:56.291
Halime!

40:57.824 --> 41:01.057
Halime. My dear sister!

41:04.391 --> 41:06.224
I missed you so much.

41:08.457 --> 41:10.924
Come on, have a seat.

41:13.324 --> 41:14.924
Are you alright?

41:14.991 --> 41:16.457
I am alright, thank you.

41:23.957 --> 41:25.857
I know about everything, Selcan.

41:30.791 --> 41:35.991
What that bitch named Goncagul
is not Gundogdu Bey, Halime.

41:36.157 --> 41:38.124
I know that.

41:39.124 --> 41:40.791
What do you mean, Selcan?

41:41.591 --> 41:44.857
All they want is just one thing.

41:47.791 --> 41:51.024
They want
the consignation of Suleyman Shah.

41:52.224 --> 41:54.557
Selcan, are you aware of
what you are saying?

41:56.324 --> 42:01.924
They want to settle in Dodurga first,
and then in the Kayi marquee.

42:04.191 --> 42:08.124
Nothing will be like before in this
nomad tent anymore, Halime.

42:11.157 --> 42:14.291
Selcan for God's sake, level with me.

42:16.257 --> 42:21.424
Gumustekin, Aytolun, Goncagul...

42:23.524 --> 42:27.224
...they all want to drag us
towards a disaster.

42:30.857 --> 42:32.457
Aytolun...

42:34.291 --> 42:40.891
...that woman seduced my uncle
even before my aunt died.

42:42.891 --> 42:48.157
The woman who told this to me was killed
the same night she talked to me.

42:58.224 --> 42:59.991
I am telling you, Halime...

43:01.457 --> 43:04.991
...they are hiding
much more things from us.

43:12.291 --> 43:16.557
I will reveal all of them one by one.

43:19.957 --> 43:21.424
Now tell me.

43:23.957 --> 43:26.157
Are you with me on this?

46:32.791 --> 46:34.891
Place the men behind the bushes there.

46:34.957 --> 46:38.824
And over there. We cannot let
Ertugrul escape. Be quick.

51:38.224 --> 51:39.224
Brother.

51:39.991 --> 51:41.557
Brother!

52:02.557 --> 52:05.457
Ertugrul is here, Noyan, he just went in.

52:08.091 --> 52:11.957
So, I will witness
the meeting of Suleyman Shah's sons.

52:13.824 --> 52:16.291
There cannot be a better day to kill.

52:44.457 --> 52:46.291
Come on, have a seat.

52:54.857 --> 52:58.057
Last time I saw you, you were
in the shores of Caspian Sea.

52:59.324 --> 53:01.324
You ramped your horse.

53:03.124 --> 53:05.991
You were holding this sword
which Wild Demir made.

53:11.324 --> 53:16.791
You were going to war with my father
Suleyman Shah and my brother Gundogdu Bey.

53:21.891 --> 53:25.524
And you were saying without considering
your age that you were going to...

53:25.591 --> 53:27.224
...deal with the Mongolians.

53:27.591 --> 53:29.557
You were turning the place upside down.

53:29.891 --> 53:34.591
My mother was making Wild Demir hold
your arms in order to restrain you.

53:52.291 --> 53:55.857
Gundogdu, there might be
other Mongolians around.

53:56.157 --> 53:58.924
Now listen to me,
nobody moves from their positions.

53:58.991 --> 54:02.357
I will go first in order to see whether
there are more Mongolians or not.

54:02.424 --> 54:06.791
What are you saying, Bey?
For better or for worse!

54:07.191 --> 54:10.157
We cannot be martyrs
before seeing Noyan die!

54:10.257 --> 54:11.524
All together.

54:12.491 --> 54:16.524
Our lives for are not
even a drop in the ocean for our nation.

54:18.791 --> 54:22.257
You stay here so that
there is a commander for the Alps.

54:26.391 --> 54:29.391
Do not move from your positions
until the last moment.

55:07.057 --> 55:09.024
Where is this man?

55:15.157 --> 55:16.857
<i>Tekbir</i>  in every mouth!

55:16.924 --> 55:22.357
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

55:22.524 --> 55:27.524
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

55:43.424 --> 55:45.824
Help me!

55:46.357 --> 55:49.224
Who are you? I said who are you!

56:01.457 --> 56:06.824
Inform Noyan, tell him that
Karabey's messenger has just arrived.

56:06.957 --> 56:08.924
This is really important for Noyan.

56:09.424 --> 56:12.191
What are you waiting for? Me to die?

56:14.057 --> 56:16.424
Your longing turned into coal
inside of us.

56:18.457 --> 56:21.591
Year after year,
that coal turned into fire.

56:23.224 --> 56:27.924
However, we never lost
the hope of finding you.

56:29.457 --> 56:31.991
Thanks to the One
who brought us together.

56:38.491 --> 56:41.124
Come on!

57:57.557 --> 58:00.324
I am going to make you regret
for not dying, Tugtekin!

58:00.424 --> 58:02.791
You will curse
the day you were born, Tangut!

58:57.791 --> 59:02.491
They say a brave man came
to replace my little brother.

59:04.857 --> 59:09.324
He challenged and beat all men...

59:11.424 --> 59:16.457
...from the lands that the Sun rises
to the lands that the Sun sets.

59:18.091 --> 59:20.924
We cannot get even close to you
when it comes to being brave.

59:24.057 --> 59:26.591
Come here.

59:38.424 --> 59:40.857
You smell like my father, brother.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:29.524
By the name of God!

01:00:29.957 --> 01:00:32.891
By the name of God!

01:00:47.057 --> 01:00:48.857
Attack!

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:04.491
After Aleppo, we came to Erzurum
to fight against Mongolians...

01:02:04.557 --> 01:02:05.957
...with our Sultan.

01:02:06.057 --> 01:02:07.991
I know it all brother.

01:02:09.324 --> 01:02:11.324
Things you did in Aleppo.

01:02:11.491 --> 01:02:15.491
The Templars. Halime Sultan.

01:02:17.257 --> 01:02:19.457
That I am going to be an uncle.

01:02:22.024 --> 01:02:26.491
My mother, my father, you taking the
responsibility of being Bey, everything.

01:02:30.891 --> 01:02:33.157
Other than the suffering
because of all the longing...

01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:37.324
...it feels like I have never left.

01:02:39.791 --> 01:02:41.457
And you, brother?

01:02:45.457 --> 01:02:50.991
In the war I fought with my father and
brother Gundogdu, I was captured.

01:02:52.057 --> 01:02:54.391
You thought I died.

01:02:55.557 --> 01:02:57.857
My mother never believed that
you were dead.

01:03:58.324 --> 01:03:59.791
And then?

01:04:01.257 --> 01:04:02.957
I had a chance and escaped.

01:04:05.057 --> 01:04:08.557
The only thing I thought was to
come back to my nomad group...

01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:09.991
...to my family.

01:04:11.357 --> 01:04:13.991
I a man's life on the way.

01:04:15.124 --> 01:04:20.457
Then I learned that he was one of the
closest men of Genghis Khan.

01:04:22.991 --> 01:04:26.924
He trusted me and took me to Genghis Khan.

01:04:27.357 --> 01:04:29.224
I came into the presence of Khan...

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:31.024
...he rewarded me.

01:04:31.791 --> 01:04:33.024
He welcomed me.

01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:39.057
And then this man took me to son
of Genghis Khan, Ogeday.

01:04:40.257 --> 01:04:46.291
From China to India, we ride our horses.

01:04:48.224 --> 01:04:50.057
Who is this man?

01:04:53.891 --> 01:04:55.491
Noyan.

01:05:04.345 --> 01:05:09.345
I played this game to write and send
what I saw to our Sultan Aladdin.

01:05:11.245 --> 01:05:12.278
I used Noyan.

01:05:14.645 --> 01:05:15.712
Our Sultan Aladdin...

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:19.045
...managed the Mongolian politics

01:05:19.745 --> 01:05:21.612
...with the information I sent,
for sake of state.

01:05:24.078 --> 01:05:25.812
Many times we came back of wars.

01:05:27.378 --> 01:05:30.078
We were saved from the war...

01:05:31.112 --> 01:05:32.912
...with our Sultan's wisdom
and my information.

01:05:34.878 --> 01:05:35.878
But...

01:05:37.778 --> 01:05:38.812
...it is over now.

01:05:41.978 --> 01:05:45.012
The target of cruel Ogeday is Anatolia.

01:05:47.145 --> 01:05:50.078
If his arm arrives here...

01:05:51.378 --> 01:05:54.978
...they do not leave any person alive.

01:06:01.678 --> 01:06:03.945
I did not show concern for you for years.

01:06:05.845 --> 01:06:09.245
Because it was the best
that you knew me as martyr.

01:10:05.678 --> 01:10:07.078
I have one last duty, brother.

01:10:09.378 --> 01:10:10.845
That is why I wanted to see you.

01:10:12.078 --> 01:10:15.345
I can do anything for my state
and for you, brother.

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:17.812
You, brave as a lion!

01:10:19.745 --> 01:10:20.778
Thank you.

01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:27.645
Sultan Aladdin gave me a duty...

01:10:28.745 --> 01:10:30.178
...to withdraw the Turks fighting...

01:10:31.112 --> 01:10:32.678
...in Mongolian army, brother.

01:10:37.812 --> 01:10:38.845
How will this work?

01:11:04.012 --> 01:11:05.145
It is the seal of Oghuz Khan.

01:11:18.245 --> 01:11:22.112
Our Sultan hopes that this seal...

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:26.312
...will harden the bonds of brotherhood
over the Oghuz's that we lost.

01:11:36.345 --> 01:11:38.112
That is why I will go to the lands
of our ancestors.

01:11:41.845 --> 01:11:43.212
What kind of power will this seal has?

01:11:44.045 --> 01:11:45.612
The seal is what you see, brother.

01:11:46.678 --> 01:11:51.812
The real issue is to remind our brothers
serving to Mongolians who they really are.

01:11:53.778 --> 01:11:57.845
To save them from slavery and
to divide the Mongolian army.

01:11:59.978 --> 01:12:04.712
If the Turks were not so supportive,
they could not get so strong.

01:12:06.612 --> 01:12:08.212
Sultan Aladdin is right, brother.

01:12:10.745 --> 01:12:15.078
But if we cannot bring the Islamic...

01:12:16.745 --> 01:12:19.145
...world together and cannot get
any help from other Muslims.

01:12:20.312 --> 01:12:23.012
Sultan Aladdin cannot do anything alone.

01:12:25.212 --> 01:12:26.978
I hope these days are
very close, brother.

01:12:28.312 --> 01:12:29.312
I hope so, too.

01:12:32.245 --> 01:12:38.145
Now, the reason that I wanted you
to come no matter what is...

01:12:39.345 --> 01:12:40.378
I wonder.

01:12:43.912 --> 01:12:45.912
I want you to meet me
with the white-bearded.

01:12:49.078 --> 01:12:52.145
I cannot do this without their help.

01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:04.312
So you have the Oghuz Khan's seal.

01:13:13.945 --> 01:13:16.812
Tell me about Sungurtekin.

01:13:24.278 --> 01:13:26.078
Tell me so I can get my power back.

01:13:34.412 --> 01:13:38.678
Did the sun of steppe blast his skin?

01:13:45.745 --> 01:13:47.245
Did he have wrinkles on his face?

01:13:56.712 --> 01:14:00.945
The last time I saw him,
he was a young man.

01:14:08.612 --> 01:14:09.778
Now, tell me about him.

01:14:11.278 --> 01:14:12.645
How did he grow up?

01:14:14.178 --> 01:14:16.312
How did he become such a valiant man?

01:14:25.345 --> 01:14:28.145
He never forgets about Suleyman Shah
or you, mother.

01:14:30.112 --> 01:14:31.778
His brothers, his nomad tent.

01:14:34.078 --> 01:14:38.845
Even if so many times passed he knows
every breath you took, mother.

01:14:45.278 --> 01:14:47.378
How do you know my secret about
the white-bearded, brother?

01:14:52.278 --> 01:14:53.978
Let us say that cranes flew and told me.

01:15:00.345 --> 01:15:03.378
Now tell me, are you with me?

01:15:05.678 --> 01:15:06.978
I am always with you, brother.

01:15:17.878 --> 01:15:19.778
I wish that my mother and Gundogdu brother
could also see you.

01:15:20.278 --> 01:15:21.645
If I do not die...

01:15:22.712 --> 01:15:24.878
...I will return to my nomad tent
after I fulfilled my duty.

01:15:26.912 --> 01:15:28.178
There is no time to lose.

01:15:29.745 --> 01:15:32.812
Kiss both my mother's and
Gundogdu brother's hand for me.

01:15:37.212 --> 01:15:38.412
There is no time to lose.

01:15:40.812 --> 01:15:44.145
Then, let us go to Ahlat.

01:16:09.712 --> 01:16:10.712
Noyan!

01:17:21.945 --> 01:17:23.045
Attack them!

01:17:24.245 --> 01:17:26.712
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:17:36.845 --> 01:17:38.145
Come along, my lads!

01:17:43.978 --> 01:17:45.045
With God's help!

01:18:00.878 --> 01:18:01.912
May God be with you!

01:18:30.112 --> 01:18:31.278
The day I learned your betrayal...

01:18:32.178 --> 01:18:34.345
...I dedicated your carrion to the
spiritual powers, Sungurtekin!

01:18:48.245 --> 01:18:50.345
I will offer your carrions to the souls!

01:18:51.312 --> 01:18:54.112
The seal of Oghuz Khan will be my award.

01:23:29.245 --> 01:23:30.378
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:23:31.612 --> 01:23:32.612
Father!

01:24:05.712 --> 01:24:06.712
Son!

01:24:07.212 --> 01:24:08.312
Abdurrahman!

01:24:09.678 --> 01:24:10.678
Son.

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:14.412
God, do not make me suffer for another
lose of child one more time.

01:24:15.045 --> 01:24:17.812
Abdurrahman! Abdurrahman!
Open your eyes, brother.

01:24:18.312 --> 01:24:19.378
Open your eyes!

01:25:35.178 --> 01:25:36.278
Hamza!

01:25:49.112 --> 01:25:50.245
Noyan!

01:25:54.712 --> 01:25:56.078
I know the trap you set to me!

01:25:57.978 --> 01:25:59.845
My Alps destroy your cantonment!

01:26:02.378 --> 01:26:03.745
They also kill the soldiers!

01:26:05.878 --> 01:26:07.045
Just like I do!

01:27:01.278 --> 01:27:02.712
My Bey, wait. Wait.

01:27:05.812 --> 01:27:07.645
I understood when I saw
Abdurrahman like this.

01:27:08.312 --> 01:27:09.345
I made a mistake.

01:27:11.912 --> 01:27:14.378
I am so poor to be defeated
to my anger for you.

01:27:16.312 --> 01:27:17.712
My blood is halal to you.

01:27:18.012 --> 01:27:21.278
Your blood is even illicit to this land!

01:28:34.078 --> 01:28:36.078
Brother! Brother! Get up, brother!

01:28:36.745 --> 01:28:37.845
Brother! Get up, brother!

01:28:38.178 --> 01:28:40.812
Brother! Brother! Get up, brother!

01:28:41.978 --> 01:28:44.278
Brother! Get up, brother!
Brother! Get up, brother!

01:28:44.912 --> 01:28:46.245
Brother! Brother!

01:28:47.278 --> 01:28:49.678
-How is the situation?
-We could not make it, Bey.

01:28:50.145 --> 01:28:51.612
Abdurrahman is dying, Bey.

01:28:54.712 --> 01:28:57.145
-Brother, get up!
-Abdurrahman, open your eyes.

01:29:13.712 --> 01:29:14.845
Mother, are you alright?

01:29:21.078 --> 01:29:23.612
I just...

01:29:26.412 --> 01:29:30.645
...a cold wind covered my whole body.

01:29:37.878 --> 01:29:43.778
I breathe in hopes that,
he will come back for years.

01:29:49.378 --> 01:29:51.178
If I lose this hope now...

01:29:54.845 --> 01:29:59.312
...I will not have power to live
or breathe.

01:30:05.378 --> 01:30:06.412
I know that.

01:30:08.978 --> 01:30:10.778
I am afraid not to see him.

01:31:05.712 --> 01:31:06.745
Brother?

01:31:07.278 --> 01:31:09.412
Brother? Brother? Brother?

01:31:10.645 --> 01:31:13.178
-Did you take it?
-I took it brother, I took it.

01:31:15.978 --> 01:31:17.012
My valiant brother.

01:31:25.145 --> 01:31:26.745
Brother! Brother!

01:31:27.612 --> 01:31:29.012
Open your eyes, for God's sake!

01:31:32.778 --> 01:31:33.845
Brother!

01:31:34.412 --> 01:31:37.612
Hang on, brother! Hang on! Hang on!

01:31:39.112 --> 01:31:40.145
Hang on!

01:31:42.712 --> 01:31:43.812
Get up, brother!

01:31:45.378 --> 01:31:47.312
Open your eyes, brother! Open your eyes!

01:31:52.145 --> 01:31:55.678
After I lost my two sons to Mongolians,
God saved you for me.

01:31:58.178 --> 01:32:01.612
You win your chiefdom with your policy,
your Alp spirit with your sword...

01:32:02.412 --> 01:32:04.612
...my daughter's heart with your bravery.

01:32:05.878 --> 01:32:07.045
Thank you, Bey.

01:32:07.678 --> 01:32:09.645
It is my happiest day.

01:32:53.345 --> 01:32:54.412
They asked for mercy, Bey.

01:32:56.045 --> 01:32:57.912
We cannot hit to people asked for mercy.

01:32:58.145 --> 01:33:00.645
However, they are not human.

01:33:10.278 --> 01:33:11.878
We make them prisoner and
take them to nomad group.

01:33:13.278 --> 01:33:15.412
They might be useful. Who knows?

01:33:16.345 --> 01:33:18.978
Maybe they will help to save
one of our valiants.

01:33:22.378 --> 01:33:23.978
Is that cur escaped, Bey?

01:33:26.078 --> 01:33:27.145
Yes, he escaped.

01:33:33.312 --> 01:33:34.712
We will go back to nomad group
with victory, Bey.

01:33:35.678 --> 01:33:36.878
And this victory is yours.

01:33:38.178 --> 01:33:40.745
Victory is ours brother, ours.

01:33:46.712 --> 01:33:47.845
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:33:48.245 --> 01:33:49.778
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:33:50.212 --> 01:33:51.645
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:33:52.012 --> 01:33:53.245
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:33:53.812 --> 01:33:55.078
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:33:55.612 --> 01:33:56.912
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:33:57.245 --> 01:33:58.612
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:34:47.678 --> 01:34:48.678
Did you bring golds?

01:35:03.745 --> 01:35:05.912
-Is there any news from Noyan?
-No, sir.

01:35:07.245 --> 01:35:08.812
Where are they?
What is happening?

01:35:09.812 --> 01:35:11.778
We need to discover what they are into.

01:35:13.612 --> 01:35:14.678
Wait for my news.

01:35:31.945 --> 01:35:34.378
Seal of Oghuz Khan is consignation
to you, brother.

01:35:36.145 --> 01:35:39.712
Do not worry, brother.
Please stay with me.

01:35:40.745 --> 01:35:41.945
My mother waits for you.

01:36:16.212 --> 01:36:19.312
Seljukian golds, they all are done
as I promised.

01:36:22.212 --> 01:36:26.178
As you agreed with Gundogdu Bey,
you brought gold.

01:36:27.245 --> 01:36:30.245
Herd and property of my nomad group
is yours.

01:36:31.878 --> 01:36:36.812
My men will load properties until morning
we will place them to caravansary...

01:36:37.178 --> 01:36:39.178
...and will be on the road,
with the help of God.

01:36:40.812 --> 01:36:43.212
Thank you. May God help you.

01:36:43.812 --> 01:36:45.012
Thank you, Hayme Hatun.

01:36:45.745 --> 01:36:47.078
I have not seen Gundogdu Bey.

01:36:47.945 --> 01:36:50.045
Nobody knows anything,
knowing ones say nothing.

01:36:50.878 --> 01:36:51.912
What is happening?

01:36:54.012 --> 01:36:55.145
He has a duty.

01:36:57.145 --> 01:36:58.945
What duty, like state secret?

01:37:09.045 --> 01:37:12.612
Right. Mongolian trouble,
it is good to be careful.

01:37:14.378 --> 01:37:16.712
I say things for nothing,
classic trader words.

01:37:21.678 --> 01:37:22.978
Before I count golds one by one...

01:37:23.145 --> 01:37:26.045
...do not take properties out of
nomad group, Efrasiyab.

01:37:27.745 --> 01:37:28.745
Thank you.

01:37:30.978 --> 01:37:35.311
Deliver golds to Artuk Bey,
he will deal them to owners.

01:37:42.212 --> 01:37:44.278
Beys are safely back to
nomad group, Mother Hayme.

01:37:45.112 --> 01:37:46.612
Thanks to God.

01:37:47.178 --> 01:37:48.345
Fortunately.

01:37:54.045 --> 01:37:55.112
Excuse me.

01:38:14.278 --> 01:38:15.645
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:38:16.112 --> 01:38:17.912
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:38:18.612 --> 01:38:20.745
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:38:22.178 --> 01:38:23.745
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:38:31.145 --> 01:38:32.378
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:38:33.645 --> 01:38:35.045
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:38:44.778 --> 01:38:46.145
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:38:54.318 --> 01:38:55.452
Stop!

01:38:56.952 --> 01:38:58.352
Death to traitors!

01:38:59.285 --> 01:39:00.485
Death to traitors!

01:39:27.852 --> 01:39:29.185
Death to traitors!

01:39:29.718 --> 01:39:30.885
Stop!

01:39:31.785 --> 01:39:32.918
Stop!

01:39:35.718 --> 01:39:36.818
Do not do it!

01:39:44.918 --> 01:39:46.318
Stop! Stop!

01:39:50.552 --> 01:39:51.785
Listen, everybody!

01:39:53.618 --> 01:39:54.652
Do not do it!

01:39:55.485 --> 01:39:56.618
Murderers!

01:39:58.685 --> 01:39:59.685
Listen!

01:40:03.485 --> 01:40:05.685
Hamza is my Alp!

01:40:08.385 --> 01:40:13.285
As head of Alps, it is my duty
to give him punishment!

01:40:17.252 --> 01:40:18.318
Understood?

01:40:26.918 --> 01:40:27.918
Move on.

01:40:28.318 --> 01:40:29.618
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:40:30.285 --> 01:40:31.652
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:40:32.652 --> 01:40:34.185
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:40:34.718 --> 01:40:36.252
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:41:29.218 --> 01:41:30.218
Slowly.

01:41:39.452 --> 01:41:40.452
Slowly.

01:41:53.952 --> 01:41:55.385
You all are going to die!

01:41:55.852 --> 01:41:57.452
You all are going to die!

01:41:58.518 --> 01:41:59.818
Traitors!

01:42:15.252 --> 01:42:16.352
Traitors!

01:42:17.552 --> 01:42:18.952
Traitors!

01:42:23.552 --> 01:42:24.885
Death to Mongolians!

01:42:28.485 --> 01:42:29.718
Traitors!

01:42:31.252 --> 01:42:32.618
Death to Mongolians!

01:42:35.785 --> 01:42:37.385
Death to traitors!

01:42:39.252 --> 01:42:40.785
Death to traitors!

01:42:51.618 --> 01:42:52.918
Death to traitors!

01:43:18.418 --> 01:43:19.752
May God help us.

01:43:22.552 --> 01:43:25.485
With the name of El Shaphi,
I do whatever I can.

01:43:29.152 --> 01:43:30.652
But do not raise your hopes.

01:43:37.352 --> 01:43:38.918
Dervish, heat some water.

01:43:39.785 --> 01:43:40.785
Alright.

01:43:44.918 --> 01:43:46.785
Come along, you go and rest some.

01:44:21.485 --> 01:44:23.218
With the name of God.

01:44:25.285 --> 01:44:27.552
-Killers!
-Traitors!

01:44:30.418 --> 01:44:31.518
Give us this traitor!

01:44:34.952 --> 01:44:36.818
Death to Mongolians!
Death to Mongolians!

01:44:50.685 --> 01:44:52.852
Traitors! Traitors!

01:45:00.285 --> 01:45:02.485
<i>Noyan, I am at your service.</i>

01:45:04.818 --> 01:45:08.552
<i>Until Byzantine, all these lands</i>
 <i>will belong to us, Efrasiyab.</i>

01:45:10.718 --> 01:45:11.785
Traitor!

01:45:13.252 --> 01:45:14.452
Give him to us!

01:45:28.285 --> 01:45:29.285
We will kill him!

01:45:33.485 --> 01:45:34.585
Fall apart!

01:45:37.552 --> 01:45:38.652
Murderers!

01:45:40.685 --> 01:45:42.452
So, this time you attacked.

01:45:44.252 --> 01:45:45.618
You will have your response.

01:46:04.385 --> 01:46:08.618
Thanks to God that,
let us beat the enemy...

01:46:09.152 --> 01:46:11.218
...and live glory of victory.

01:46:13.185 --> 01:46:14.218
Thank you, Bey.

01:46:14.618 --> 01:46:18.585
We came back with victory
but could not manage to find Noyan.

01:46:20.585 --> 01:46:23.252
While you stand like lions...

01:46:24.385 --> 01:46:26.518
...you will bring his body
with God's help.

01:46:33.152 --> 01:46:36.452
Noyan cannot pull himself together
easily from now on.

01:46:38.552 --> 01:46:43.185
We are grateful to our Beys, Alps
who made us live the glory of victory.

01:46:43.785 --> 01:46:45.552
God bless them.

01:46:46.152 --> 01:46:47.385
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:46:47.552 --> 01:46:48.718
-Amen, Bey.
-Amen.

01:46:48.885 --> 01:46:52.552
Dear God, accept our martyr
to your heaven.

01:46:52.785 --> 01:46:54.252
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:46:54.518 --> 01:46:56.585
-Thankfully, we have seen it.
-Fortunately.

01:46:56.852 --> 01:46:57.918
Fortunately.

01:46:58.285 --> 01:46:59.618
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:46:59.885 --> 01:47:01.618
Long live Gumustekin Bey!

01:47:02.218 --> 01:47:03.685
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:47:04.152 --> 01:47:05.518
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:47:05.852 --> 01:47:08.218
-Long live Gumustekin Bey!
-Long live Tugtekin Bey!

01:47:08.852 --> 01:47:10.518
Long live Gumustekin Bey!

01:47:11.652 --> 01:47:12.852
Long live Gundogdu Bey!

01:47:13.185 --> 01:47:14.352
Long live Tugtekin Bey!

01:47:40.069 --> 01:47:42.203
Now, I look at your face
without shame, father.

01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:51.003
Thanks to God, we kept our promise, son.

01:47:54.569 --> 01:47:56.669
We have avanged the blood of Aykiz.

01:47:58.636 --> 01:47:59.736
Thank God.

01:48:06.203 --> 01:48:10.469
Turgut, listen carefully
what I'm about to tell you.

01:48:13.436 --> 01:48:15.436
These are the words of Aykiz.

01:48:21.069 --> 01:48:22.603
Start a family for yourself.

01:48:25.003 --> 01:48:26.936
Raise Alps that are proud of Kayi.

01:48:30.403 --> 01:48:34.669
Both me and Aykiz want to see you happy.

01:48:43.769 --> 01:48:47.969
Me and Ertugrul Bey want
the brave Alps to remember us...

01:48:48.969 --> 01:48:53.003
...and pray in front of our gravestones...

01:48:54.036 --> 01:48:56.036
...after we are long gone.

01:49:01.069 --> 01:49:02.403
Only then...

01:49:06.503 --> 01:49:10.469
... we can call this dark realm
our homeland.

01:49:19.969 --> 01:49:24.703
Until we cast out the last Mongol
from this land...

01:49:27.436 --> 01:49:29.669
...and my body is laid to rest...

01:49:31.936 --> 01:49:33.169
...I cannot stop.

01:49:39.636 --> 01:49:40.669
My home is...

01:49:44.069 --> 01:49:45.536
...my gravestone, father.

01:49:47.536 --> 01:49:48.603
My gravestone.

01:50:34.069 --> 01:50:36.069
Find Noyan and tell him that
I am waiting for his orders.

01:51:42.536 --> 01:51:44.436
I cared for you like my own son.

01:51:46.736 --> 01:51:50.603
When your father became a martyr
right next to Suleyman Shah...

01:51:53.469 --> 01:51:56.736
...I laid you down to sleep in the
same place with my sons...

01:51:57.569 --> 01:51:59.903
...so that you won't feel lonely.

01:52:04.603 --> 01:52:06.403
I cared for you like your mother.

01:52:09.636 --> 01:52:10.636
Why?

01:52:17.569 --> 01:52:18.969
Even these words...

01:52:21.569 --> 01:52:22.669
...are a shame to my tongue.

01:52:25.136 --> 01:52:26.536
You are not even worth...

01:52:28.636 --> 01:52:29.936
...my spit.

01:52:32.469 --> 01:52:34.769
How are you going to cross
the narrow bridge of Al-Sirat...

01:52:36.503 --> 01:52:42.803
...with all the sins that you bear?

01:52:44.636 --> 01:52:45.669
Shame.

01:52:47.603 --> 01:52:48.703
Shame on you.

01:52:50.736 --> 01:52:51.869
Shame on you!

01:53:02.969 --> 01:53:04.803
You killed all of those brothers...

01:53:06.169 --> 01:53:08.869
...yet you never gave them
the blessing of God.

01:53:12.636 --> 01:53:15.003
You did not give them a chance to
recite shahada.

01:53:17.636 --> 01:53:18.636
Was it worth it?

01:53:25.503 --> 01:53:28.103
I wish you were brave enough to face me.

01:53:30.003 --> 01:53:31.703
And get your answers with your sword.

01:53:33.903 --> 01:53:35.036
I would respect you then.

01:53:37.003 --> 01:53:40.036
If you could make me bleed,
I would thank you.

01:53:42.903 --> 01:53:44.003
But what did you do?

01:53:46.803 --> 01:53:47.836
Shame on you.

01:53:51.136 --> 01:53:54.869
I will execute you in training field.

01:53:56.903 --> 01:53:58.003
Just so you know.

01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:09.669
Guard!

01:54:20.469 --> 01:54:21.569
Give him a prayer rug.

01:54:22.936 --> 01:54:27.769
Let him pray if there is an ounce of
fear of God left in him.

01:54:42.636 --> 01:54:46.069
Dear God, what have I done?

01:54:48.403 --> 01:54:49.536
What have I done?

01:55:26.936 --> 01:55:28.803
Who is behind this, wise one?

01:55:30.769 --> 01:55:32.603
You will find your peace...

01:55:34.969 --> 01:55:36.469
...when you confess it to yourself.

01:55:37.469 --> 01:55:40.403
Noyan lost, you know this too.

01:55:42.003 --> 01:55:43.969
A one-armed shepherd defeated him.

01:55:49.036 --> 01:55:50.103
Someone is coming.

01:57:28.536 --> 01:57:29.936
You were also trapped, huh?

01:57:32.036 --> 01:57:33.103
Yes, Noyan.

01:57:46.769 --> 01:57:48.136
Ertugrul took his revenge.

01:57:50.503 --> 01:57:51.936
He hit us with our own trap.

01:57:58.969 --> 01:58:00.969
How did he know
that I laid a trap for him?

01:58:02.836 --> 01:58:04.703
Tangut, how?

01:58:16.069 --> 01:58:17.136
My soldiers...

01:58:18.803 --> 01:58:20.536
Some soldiers ran away, Noyan.

01:58:22.069 --> 01:58:24.903
They took Hamza to the nomad group.

01:58:26.669 --> 01:58:27.736
Hamza.

01:58:33.569 --> 01:58:35.003
Kill everyone who ran away.

01:58:37.203 --> 01:58:39.103
Demand another vanguard from Ogeday.

01:58:41.869 --> 01:58:45.836
From now on, we will set our camp
inside the cave of courage.

01:58:47.869 --> 01:58:49.469
The real war begins now.

01:58:54.736 --> 01:58:55.836
You go with Tangut.

01:58:59.803 --> 01:59:01.569
And learn why the spirits are
upset with me.

01:59:04.469 --> 01:59:07.436
What will you do all alone here, Noyan?
You are injured.

01:59:52.736 --> 01:59:53.869
Help...

01:59:57.903 --> 01:59:59.669
Help...

02:01:04.903 --> 02:01:06.569
Efrasiyab waits for your order, Noyan.

02:01:08.136 --> 02:01:09.503
Listen to me carefully.

02:01:11.636 --> 02:01:16.669
Tell Efrasiyab that, Noyan wants to know
where Ertugrul went.

02:01:18.503 --> 02:01:20.036
This important more than anything.

02:01:21.936 --> 02:01:23.103
Do you understand?

02:01:25.869 --> 02:01:27.203
If he learns anything...

02:01:28.569 --> 02:01:30.469
...tell him to find me
in the place we always meet.

02:01:32.769 --> 02:01:33.769
Go.

02:02:42.503 --> 02:02:44.869
-Gundogdu Bey.
-Goncagul Hatun.

02:02:46.536 --> 02:02:50.569
I used to have nightmares
whenever my father went to war.

02:02:52.003 --> 02:02:56.069
But this time, I sent both my father
and husband to war.

02:02:58.669 --> 02:03:01.803
This feels different, really different.

02:03:04.903 --> 02:03:06.636
Thank God, you came back unharmed.

02:03:19.103 --> 02:03:20.703
We die only once in battle...

02:03:22.703 --> 02:03:24.636
...yet our women die thousands of times.

02:03:27.103 --> 02:03:28.469
I know that from my mother.

02:03:30.436 --> 02:03:34.636
While we do battle with our enemies,
our women battle against fate.

02:03:37.703 --> 02:03:40.969
If you ask me which batlle is harder...

02:03:44.769 --> 02:03:46.003
...my answer is obvious.

02:03:48.536 --> 02:03:50.703
May God never take you away from us.

02:03:52.436 --> 02:03:53.869
May God give you patience.

02:04:22.603 --> 02:04:23.769
Is Korkut Bey inside?

02:04:25.703 --> 02:04:27.636
They wait for you
with Tugtekin Bey, father.

02:04:45.636 --> 02:04:51.103
Victory is ours but the jackal
we are looking for is nowhere to be found.

02:04:52.569 --> 02:04:54.036
Noyan will seek revenge.

02:04:55.769 --> 02:04:57.436
Cowards die many times
before their deaths.

02:04:58.503 --> 02:05:00.436
We will take our precautions.

02:05:02.903 --> 02:05:07.769
As Ertugrul Bey said, we need to
follow this jackal and show no quarter.

02:05:09.703 --> 02:05:11.003
You are right, Tugtekin Bey.

02:05:11.969 --> 02:05:16.769
We should not let Noyan and his soldiers
feel safe even for a moment.

02:05:18.636 --> 02:05:21.769
Each breathe they take
may become our death.

02:05:49.469 --> 02:05:50.936
This cloth will look good on my mother.

02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:57.669
Why is Ertugrul not back yet?

02:05:58.569 --> 02:05:59.869
He will come, if God permits.

02:06:02.669 --> 02:06:04.136
Gokce, do you think these colors are fine?

02:06:06.503 --> 02:06:08.703
Good. My mother's favorite colors.

02:06:15.703 --> 02:06:17.103
How you can be so calm?

02:06:20.469 --> 02:06:22.736
Every day something happens to Ertugrul.

02:06:23.603 --> 02:06:26.036
Every day he causes trouble for us.

02:06:29.903 --> 02:06:31.736
I cannot sleep thinking that...

02:06:32.136 --> 02:06:33.803
...something bad will happen to him.

02:06:35.603 --> 02:06:36.636
But you...

02:06:40.403 --> 02:06:42.836
My Bey's troubles are always welcome,
Gokce.

02:06:45.069 --> 02:06:48.169
I know that he always has the solution.

02:06:52.636 --> 02:06:53.636
Gumustekin.

02:06:55.403 --> 02:06:59.436
You represent the palace and
the nomad group at the same time.

02:07:00.803 --> 02:07:02.969
Your advice is valuable to me.

02:07:04.203 --> 02:07:07.469
What do you say these
brave warriors' words?

02:07:12.469 --> 02:07:14.603
We are against a madman
crazy enought to...

02:07:14.836 --> 02:07:16.969
...launch a suicide attack
to our nomad group at night.

02:07:19.403 --> 02:07:24.403
As our firt Alp said,
he will not be our shadow, we will be his.

02:07:25.069 --> 02:07:28.203
These mountains will be the death of
Noyan and his army.

02:07:30.836 --> 02:07:32.403
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

02:07:41.469 --> 02:07:42.669
I hope nothing is wrong.

02:07:43.536 --> 02:07:45.169
Kaya, what is happening?

02:07:48.436 --> 02:07:50.969
My Bey, Ertugrul Bey came to nomad group
with an injured man.

02:07:51.636 --> 02:07:52.669
Sungurtekin!

02:08:01.436 --> 02:08:02.503
What is happening?

02:08:02.669 --> 02:08:04.003
I hope nothing is wrong, Mother Hayme.

02:08:08.436 --> 02:08:11.503
Ertugrul Bey returns, Mother Hayme.
He carries an injured man on his horse.

02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:13.136
Sungurtekin!

02:11:44.103 --> 02:11:45.503
I made you a promise, mother.

02:11:47.069 --> 02:11:48.503
I said I would bring your son.

02:12:04.603 --> 02:12:05.736
Mother.

02:12:06.436 --> 02:12:07.636
My dear son.

02:12:09.403 --> 02:12:10.536
My dear son!

02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:13.669
My son, remedy of my sorrow!

02:12:15.169 --> 02:12:16.169
Mother!

02:12:32.669 --> 02:12:34.803
I am back, mother. I am back.
