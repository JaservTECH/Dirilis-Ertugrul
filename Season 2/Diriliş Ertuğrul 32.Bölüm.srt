00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 33 will start after 11:49 min.

11:49.222 --> 11:53.222
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

11:54.486 --> 11:58.153
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

11:58.735 --> 12:01.902
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:12.557 --> 12:15.691
If it would remind you who you are,
where you came from...

12:16.524 --> 12:20.091
...and that you are Suleyman Shah's son,
take my life, brother.

12:29.057 --> 12:30.124
Do you remember, brother?

12:33.391 --> 12:34.391
I did.

12:39.691 --> 12:40.957
You reminded me who I am.

12:44.024 --> 12:47.157
You tricked my father and
led all of us to danger.

12:49.191 --> 12:50.991
You blamed me of being a coward.

12:52.024 --> 12:55.591
But you are a coward
who betrays his mother.

13:11.657 --> 13:14.857
If those did not remind you,
perhaps this will, brother.

13:16.991 --> 13:18.791
Go to hell, Ertugrul.

13:38.891 --> 13:40.757
Go! Go on!

13:51.057 --> 13:53.124
<i>The two brothers lead</i>
 <i>Kayi towards a cliff.</i>

13:54.024 --> 13:55.590
<i>I will not let them.</i>

13:59.457 --> 14:02.590
<i>I will wait for the nightfall and</i>
 <i>see what it will lead up to.</i>

14:25.191 --> 14:28.124
Very nice. God bless your hands.

14:40.057 --> 14:41.924
These are marvelous patterns.

14:43.024 --> 14:44.124
God bless your hands.

14:45.157 --> 14:47.591
Selcan, you made a great color harmony.

14:48.391 --> 14:50.757
We did it like Halime taught us.

14:54.991 --> 14:57.991
Would you like to see
the armors Gokce made?

14:59.024 --> 15:00.024
I do.

15:18.491 --> 15:20.357
What did you put behind the armor?

15:20.657 --> 15:21.991
I put wire and felt, mother.

15:24.124 --> 15:27.124
Neither an arrow nor a spear
could pierce it.

15:28.324 --> 15:29.324
Well done.

15:33.691 --> 15:34.991
God bless your hands.

15:36.291 --> 15:39.791
Dodurga and Kayi women
are getting along well.

15:43.191 --> 15:44.357
Right, Selcan Hatun?

15:50.324 --> 15:55.724
I hope that our Alps will be united like
our women, soon, Mother Hayme.

15:56.491 --> 15:58.391
Do you doubt it, Aytolun?

16:02.357 --> 16:05.991
If you and Bey are leading our tribes,
I have no doubts.

16:06.991 --> 16:11.524
But Ertugrul's stubbornness
worries me just like everyone else.

16:14.757 --> 16:17.557
My son stated that he would obey
the headquarters' judgment.

16:17.624 --> 16:19.091
He would keep his promise.

16:19.157 --> 16:20.224
Mother Hayme.

16:21.124 --> 16:24.791
Ertugrul Bey and Gundogdu Bey are
fighting at the entrance of tribe.

16:27.491 --> 16:29.691
This is what I was trying to tell to you,
Mother Hayme.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.757
Control your son
or he will be the cause of our disaster.

16:55.624 --> 16:57.191
What happened, Kocabash?

16:57.491 --> 16:58.524
Ertugrul Bey.

16:59.724 --> 17:02.157
He waited Gundogdu Bey
at entrance of tribe.

17:02.357 --> 17:05.057
When we arrived, he walked up to Bey.
They fought with each other.

17:05.324 --> 17:07.124
We could not break up the fight.

17:08.057 --> 17:09.724
Is this your prudent nephew, father?

17:13.191 --> 17:14.457
Why is he acting like this?

17:17.791 --> 17:19.424
Everyone knows what happened.

17:22.791 --> 17:26.591
Ertugrul will be a trouble not just
to his tribe but to us as well.

17:29.291 --> 17:32.357
Bey, you must find a way
to bring him into line.

17:34.791 --> 17:36.024
Dear God!

17:37.591 --> 17:39.124
Ambition, Bey, ambition.

17:40.191 --> 17:42.091
Ambition is the root of all evil.

17:42.657 --> 17:44.491
And the demons around him.

17:46.224 --> 17:47.324
For example, Selcan.

17:48.691 --> 17:50.724
She always instigates Halime Sultan.

17:52.391 --> 17:56.457
Father, if you do not stop him,
I will bring him into the line.

18:26.457 --> 18:28.391
-Gundogdu!
-Don't ask anything, Selcan.

18:29.791 --> 18:34.057
Mother, control your son
or I swear this will end ugly.

18:34.657 --> 18:36.124
What are you saying, son?

18:37.091 --> 18:38.291
Why are you so tactless?

18:39.357 --> 18:42.191
What does a fight
between two brothers mean?

18:43.391 --> 18:45.291
Did your father raise you for this?

18:45.691 --> 18:48.391
Do not tell these to me
but to your impudent son.

18:50.491 --> 18:52.057
I cannot handle you anymore.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.324
You crossed the line!

18:56.424 --> 18:59.724
From now on, if you do something
like this again...

19:01.491 --> 19:03.091
...you will not have my blessing.

19:13.557 --> 19:16.191
If Bey is not in tribe,
he must be at Geyikli's place.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.724
This tribe is not a blessing  for us.

19:32.424 --> 19:34.124
Tell your lame handed Bey that...

19:34.991 --> 19:36.624
...if he causes any more trouble
in my tribe...

19:37.091 --> 19:38.657
...I will nail his other hand.

20:23.943 --> 20:25.743
Is Baycu Noyan awake?

20:27.343 --> 20:28.876
Was he pleased with you?

20:32.510 --> 20:36.743
If you want to live,
you must please Noyan.

20:37.876 --> 20:39.976
Do you understand what I mean?

20:41.476 --> 20:42.643
Good.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.043
Go, now.

20:55.410 --> 20:56.943
Baycu Noyan!

21:11.510 --> 21:15.376
Have you decided what to do to
the merchant who dealt with Gundogdu?

21:19.410 --> 21:24.410
What keeps parasite Kayis
and Dodurgas together, Tankut?

21:25.310 --> 21:26.710
The fear they have for us.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.743
What else?

21:30.343 --> 21:31.876
Their brotherhood traditions.

21:33.976 --> 21:39.376
How long will Dodurgas feed Kayis
on long winter days?

21:39.943 --> 21:41.976
Brotherhood is up to some extent.

21:46.610 --> 21:51.743
What happens if Kayis could not
sell their goods and herds?

21:53.576 --> 21:55.676
They will go at it hammer and tongs.

22:00.743 --> 22:02.510
That merchant will die.

22:02.743 --> 22:04.876
Efrasiyab will fill his place.

22:05.943 --> 22:09.976
We will take everything two nomad tents
have.

22:11.610 --> 22:15.643
So, do Oghuz tribes bound up
to their traditions?

23:05.510 --> 23:07.576
Oh, Ak Tolgali.

23:09.043 --> 23:10.776
The sky cracked.

23:12.610 --> 23:15.876
Two brothers fight will make people
miserable.

23:21.976 --> 23:23.843
I wish I had not spoken and hit him.

23:24.410 --> 23:31.376
I wish I had control my anger,
so it would not have been.

23:37.343 --> 23:41.043
-Brother, are you alright?
-I am alright, Tugtekin.

23:42.443 --> 23:43.776
Why did he attack you?

23:45.376 --> 23:47.010
Look at this.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.576
How could a man hit his brother?

23:50.976 --> 23:53.743
Why do you care two brothers'
fight to much, Tugtekin?

23:56.843 --> 23:58.043
Save it, Selcan.

23:58.476 --> 24:01.110
Instead of scolding me,
mind the ones stoking the fire.

24:01.343 --> 24:02.843
Shut up, woman!

24:07.710 --> 24:12.543
Ertugrul Aga like a raging bull,
will put not only himself...

24:14.943 --> 24:16.776
...but all of us all in danger.

24:19.443 --> 24:21.543
Then, you will understand.

24:22.876 --> 24:27.076
Ertugrul will obey headquarters' judgment.

24:27.343 --> 24:28.976
He has to, aunt.

24:29.876 --> 24:32.043
Or I make him obey me.

24:55.343 --> 24:56.610
Bey.

25:03.443 --> 25:05.076
Ertugrul is Bey.

25:05.776 --> 25:08.010
He is hurt, he is in pain.

25:08.610 --> 25:10.843
His wounds will not heal, Gokce.

25:13.843 --> 25:15.576
You misunderstood me, Bey.

25:17.476 --> 25:19.310
Ertugrul is hurt.

25:20.643 --> 25:22.743
He twists the knife.

25:24.876 --> 25:27.043
But he is making a huge mistake.

25:28.310 --> 25:30.676
He must obey headquarters' judgments.

25:33.343 --> 25:34.943
That is what I thought.

25:36.676 --> 25:38.410
Will he obey them?

25:38.510 --> 25:42.776
Perhaps, he must suffer to obey them.

25:46.643 --> 25:50.576
Ertugrul is my dear...

25:52.010 --> 25:53.510
...my only one.

25:55.676 --> 25:57.643
But he is making a huge mistake.

26:00.476 --> 26:03.676
I want to you know, you are right...

26:04.376 --> 26:06.876
...I will be on your side in any case,
Bey.

26:10.643 --> 26:12.510
Thank you, Gokce.

26:12.610 --> 26:14.310
Thank you.

26:45.776 --> 26:48.976
-Were you kicked by a horse?
-Sort of.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.443
Sit down.

27:00.776 --> 27:03.976
-Could you find Noyan's place?
-Yes.

27:05.076 --> 27:06.510
So fast?

27:06.843 --> 27:12.476
Birds tell their place, and their place
tells the truth.

27:22.876 --> 27:29.076
-Bey, are you alright?
-Thank you, I am fine.

27:37.010 --> 27:39.510
I have one more request.

27:41.010 --> 27:42.776
My brother, Sungurtekin.

27:44.310 --> 27:50.643
Did he really betray to his nomad people
and his ancestors as Noyan said?

27:51.310 --> 27:52.510
Is he alive?

27:53.710 --> 27:56.410
Will he go back to Urumqi?

27:56.910 --> 27:58.710
I need to know these.

28:00.910 --> 28:06.743
Whether my birds talk or not,
your trouble is our trouble, Bey.

28:07.410 --> 28:13.110
If your brother is even in China,
my birds will not talk anymore.

28:21.043 --> 28:27.043
From now on, we give hard times
to idolater Mongols!

28:33.510 --> 28:34.976
Alright, Bey.

29:03.643 --> 29:05.043
What happened, Wild Demir?

29:05.110 --> 29:07.010
It will be alright, Bey.

29:07.110 --> 29:10.310
I keep my promise to Ertugrul Bey
sooner or later.

29:10.576 --> 29:13.010
-If God permits, you will.
-If God permits.

29:17.643 --> 29:23.510
Two brothers' fists hurt two nomad tents
more than the brothers.

29:24.310 --> 29:29.943
If the nomad tents get more damage,
there will be no nomad tents...

29:30.910 --> 29:32.443
...and unity.

29:33.676 --> 29:35.443
You speak the truth, Bey.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.076
You speak the truth.

29:39.043 --> 29:41.776
Ertugrul and his Alps are not around.

29:42.643 --> 29:44.576
Do you know where they are?

29:51.910 --> 29:55.076
At least tell me whether
this is going to end well or bad?

29:55.343 --> 29:59.610
If Ertugrul Bey is here, there will be
nothing bad.

30:00.010 --> 30:01.910
Do not worry, Bey.

30:04.743 --> 30:07.476
-Let us hope for the best.
-Thank you, Bey.

30:09.443 --> 30:11.310
Have a nice day, Halime Sultan.

30:11.676 --> 30:13.010
You, too, Artuk Bey.

30:18.710 --> 30:20.110
What happened, my daughter?

30:20.676 --> 30:22.576
Did something bad happen?

30:25.376 --> 30:28.843
I know you are on a though path
with Ertugrul Bey, Wild Demir.

30:30.576 --> 30:36.810
I know you are standing by your man with
your baby and huge heart,...

30:36.876 --> 30:38.510
...my daughter.

30:39.810 --> 30:41.676
My mother is also offended to my man.

30:42.910 --> 30:45.643
Like his uncle and Agha.

30:47.010 --> 30:50.310
There is no one I can talk to.

30:52.576 --> 30:55.476
Do not let anything happen to him,
Wild Demir.

30:57.710 --> 31:00.110
I have no one other than him.

31:01.476 --> 31:04.643
He loves you as his father and
minds your words.

31:04.843 --> 31:06.576
Do not be afraid, Halime daughter.

31:06.943 --> 31:10.776
I will not give those bastards
another child.

31:19.310 --> 31:21.076
-Turali.
-You have a guest.

31:21.410 --> 31:22.476
Yes.

31:24.343 --> 31:25.843
Turali?

31:35.876 --> 31:39.843
We could not imagine how it ends,
Mother Hayme.

31:41.976 --> 31:45.010
If we had known,
would not you have been in it, brother?

31:45.810 --> 31:48.576
Our judgment was not wrong, Mother Hayme.

31:49.076 --> 31:51.710
It is not good in our religion
and traditions...

31:52.476 --> 31:55.643
...not to help hard arduous people.

31:55.910 --> 32:00.076
Moreover, we back up each other
against Mongols.

32:01.643 --> 32:05.776
But Ertugrul came and ruined everything,
right?

32:11.610 --> 32:16.443
He is my blood and family.

32:17.910 --> 32:21.443
He is one of the best Alps Oghuz tribe
raised.

32:22.410 --> 32:24.076
He is like my son.

32:24.510 --> 32:30.810
But you know I will take necessary
precautions for my nomad tent's peace.

32:31.510 --> 32:33.910
If he continues acting like this...

32:34.110 --> 32:39.910
...I will have to exile him with his Alp,
Mother Hayme.

32:41.610 --> 32:43.343
Brother...

32:44.610 --> 32:48.443
...if necessary, I will do it for good of
two nomad tents.

32:49.476 --> 32:52.010
But only I could do it.

32:53.643 --> 32:55.543
Be aware of that.

33:09.110 --> 33:16.076
Have you ever thought what a female lion
about to lose her whelp could do?

33:16.843 --> 33:18.843
Now, think about it.

33:32.643 --> 33:33.876
Mother Hayme.

33:49.076 --> 33:50.943
You missed your work, right?

33:51.476 --> 33:54.376
I do not have anything except for my work,
Mother Hayme.

34:01.343 --> 34:02.710
Where are they?

34:03.776 --> 34:05.410
Who, Mother Hayme?

34:05.576 --> 34:08.010
Where are Ertugrul and his Alps?

34:08.943 --> 34:13.610
I do not know, they rode their horse
and left.

34:15.910 --> 34:17.676
Where did they go?

34:20.410 --> 34:22.410
What are you hiding from me?

34:26.343 --> 34:27.776
Wild Demir,...

34:28.043 --> 34:32.010
...if you know and not telling me
you will not have my blessing.

34:33.976 --> 34:36.943
We both know, they are up to something.

34:42.443 --> 34:45.676
Know that I will keep an eye on you.

34:55.810 --> 34:57.043
Turali.

34:57.776 --> 34:59.576
Come here.

35:00.043 --> 35:02.710
Come here, sit down.

35:19.510 --> 35:21.010
Come on.

35:26.543 --> 35:30.510
Turali, I am in trouble, right?

35:33.543 --> 35:38.743
I lied to wife of Suleyman Shah
at this age.

35:40.010 --> 35:41.976
May God forgive me.

36:45.610 --> 36:48.443
Did Sadettin Kobek handle the business?

36:56.376 --> 36:57.910
Tell me.

37:02.076 --> 37:04.776
The number of pacifists who want...

37:04.843 --> 37:08.510
...Sultan Aleaddin pay tribute to Ogeday
is raising, Noyan.

37:09.743 --> 37:11.510
Sultan is also hesitant.

37:14.010 --> 37:16.776
I do not want tribute of Aleaddin,...

37:17.110 --> 37:18.976
...I want whole Anatolia.

37:19.743 --> 37:22.643
Every inch of it, every horse on it.

37:33.643 --> 37:37.476
What about Kobek?

37:43.043 --> 37:46.776
He guarantees that he would do everything
you want, Noyan.

37:48.643 --> 37:53.310
Sultan Aleaddin's army and Ogeday's army
which is under your command will wage...

37:53.410 --> 37:57.443
...a battle in here, Erzurum, as you wish.

37:59.476 --> 38:02.843
When winter ends and spring comes,
you will be victorious.

38:05.110 --> 38:09.643
Sadettin Kobek will welcome you in Konya.

38:15.876 --> 38:20.010
Tell him to kill pacifists one by one.

38:21.910 --> 38:25.310
I want no obstacle about war.

38:27.510 --> 38:34.476
When I entered Konya with my army,
I will carry Aleaddin's head on my spear.

38:36.543 --> 38:41.976
If he does not want me spear his head,...

38:43.576 --> 38:45.910
...he must do everything I said.

40:06.010 --> 40:11.376
I need at least 40 camels to carry
the goods we bought from Kayis...

40:11.443 --> 40:13.876
...from here to Konya then to Iznik.

40:15.076 --> 40:19.076
At least 20 man to herd the animals.

40:19.443 --> 40:20.843
Take care of it immediately.

40:21.743 --> 40:23.910
Gundogdu Bey is about to come...

40:24.543 --> 40:28.076
...and I do not want be embarrassed
when we go to the nomad tent.

40:30.710 --> 40:32.376
If you excuse me.

41:41.310 --> 41:43.476
Geyikli knows where Noyan is.

41:44.743 --> 41:46.643
We will send Abdurrahman to there.

41:48.376 --> 41:49.610
What then, Bey?

41:50.043 --> 41:51.510
Then?

41:52.910 --> 41:54.843
What if Abdurrahman fails?

41:57.343 --> 41:59.476
What if Noyan wakes up to it?

42:01.110 --> 42:03.876
We will do all we can to make him
successful.

42:06.843 --> 42:08.610
If Abdurrahman fails...

42:11.810 --> 42:14.543
...it means his blood will be
on our hands.

42:21.476 --> 42:24.676
We walk on the earth.

42:30.743 --> 42:35.376
Abdurrahman will infiltrate
and give us information from Noyan.

42:37.443 --> 42:40.076
Only he can do this, now.

42:41.743 --> 42:46.743
Then, we will cut Noyan's supply routes
one by one.

42:49.343 --> 42:50.710
How will we do it?

42:51.443 --> 42:53.743
Is it easy to do it?

42:56.510 --> 42:58.310
Tomorrow is another day.

42:58.776 --> 43:00.443
I set off.

43:08.343 --> 43:10.043
He is crazy.

43:12.010 --> 43:13.743
Where did he go?

44:13.043 --> 44:14.643
Hamza?

44:15.643 --> 44:16.843
My brother.

44:17.110 --> 44:18.743
Brother.

44:21.910 --> 44:24.076
Things got messed up while you were away.

44:24.310 --> 44:25.676
I know all of them.

44:26.410 --> 44:29.843
Ertugrul Bey's mission was taken away.

44:30.776 --> 44:32.576
Even he is not an Alp now.

44:32.710 --> 44:35.943
What happens if he is an Alp or not?

44:36.443 --> 44:38.010
What are you saying, brother?

44:42.043 --> 44:44.676
There is no good in this nomad tent
after Suleyman Shah.

44:45.376 --> 44:47.410
Ertugrul made us to go this war.

44:48.443 --> 44:50.076
We were ambushed because of him.

44:50.376 --> 44:52.376
There were many martyrs because of him.

44:53.010 --> 44:54.543
He is nothing, now.

44:55.110 --> 44:57.710
He is a useless lame handed man.

44:57.810 --> 45:00.410
You are saying this because of
what Gundogdu did to you.

45:00.610 --> 45:02.543
I know you have a heart of gold.

45:04.343 --> 45:05.910
We all had a heart of gold.

45:07.510 --> 45:09.476
But they fooled us.

45:09.843 --> 45:12.410
They did it for fame and money.

45:12.843 --> 45:14.910
Gundogdu Bey betrayed to me.

45:15.643 --> 45:18.643
This betrayal will trouble us in time.

45:19.676 --> 45:20.943
All the nomad group.

45:21.976 --> 45:23.510
What are we going to do, brother?

45:24.643 --> 45:26.743
What do you want me to do?

45:29.310 --> 45:34.043
There is only one way to save
both ourselves and the nomad group.

45:36.743 --> 45:38.610
I am here to talk about it.

45:39.443 --> 45:40.743
What is it?

45:45.310 --> 45:47.010
Noyan gave us a way out.

45:50.976 --> 45:53.610
Calm down. Listen to me.

46:01.843 --> 46:03.110
You saw it.

46:04.410 --> 46:07.076
Even Hayme show her teeth to you.

46:09.710 --> 46:11.410
She is my sister.

46:11.710 --> 46:14.843
But she is leader of Kayis.

46:15.443 --> 46:17.610
And Ertugrul is her son.

46:18.876 --> 46:21.010
So, it is not easy.

46:22.010 --> 46:25.010
Her nomad tent and her son, right.

46:25.943 --> 46:30.910
But Dodurga is your nomad group and
Tugtekin is your son.

46:31.910 --> 46:35.743
You must think of your nomad group
and son first.

46:40.810 --> 46:45.776
Two nomad groups merging is a dream
as long as Ertugrul is here.

46:45.976 --> 46:51.076
There is only one move
that could merge two nomad groups.

46:53.943 --> 46:56.043
What are you thinking, Hatun?

46:59.910 --> 47:06.310
Trust neither Hayme nor Ertugrul
but trust only to Gundogdu.

47:09.476 --> 47:14.076
If you act in unison, everyone wins.

47:14.310 --> 47:15.743
How would we do it?

47:17.576 --> 47:23.543
You must plant the idea of being Kayi Bey
to Gundogdu's mind.

47:24.710 --> 47:28.343
So, he would be ambitious.

47:30.443 --> 47:33.843
If you do not do this,...

47:33.943 --> 47:38.010
...you will lose Kayi.

47:56.510 --> 47:59.843
Mother, all the tents were erected
except for 13 of them.

48:00.443 --> 48:03.776
We would provide the felt and
erect the rest of them.

48:04.443 --> 48:06.976
Nobody will be outside
when the rain comes.

48:10.543 --> 48:12.410
Thank you, my daughter.

48:13.810 --> 48:16.943
If there is nothing to say,
I want to sleep, I am exhausted.

48:18.976 --> 48:21.010
-Good night.
-Halime!

48:23.743 --> 48:24.910
Yes, mother.

48:24.976 --> 48:26.710
Where is Ertugrul?

48:28.943 --> 48:29.976
I do not know, mother.

48:30.376 --> 48:33.776
So, he rode his horse and left
without telling you anything, right?

48:35.476 --> 48:36.743
Right.

48:37.410 --> 48:39.376
Do you expect me to believe this?

48:42.643 --> 48:44.810
I tell the truth, Mother.

48:45.710 --> 48:49.476
I respect you so I do not talk
if I would lie.

48:51.710 --> 48:56.010
We both know Ertugrul
is playing with fire, right?

49:00.510 --> 49:02.476
So, I am right.

49:06.643 --> 49:10.343
What if your silence will be our disaster?

49:10.476 --> 49:11.743
Mother,...

49:12.610 --> 49:16.543
...do you want me to rat on, my husband,
your son?

49:16.610 --> 49:17.876
If necessary, yes.

49:18.710 --> 49:20.010
This is not a game!

49:20.076 --> 49:21.643
The gauntlet has been thrown.

49:22.443 --> 49:25.376
Do not make me do things that
I do not want.

49:26.310 --> 49:30.610
I have led this nomad group by trusting
Ertugrul for two years.

49:30.676 --> 49:31.910
You know this, too.

49:31.976 --> 49:33.510
So, where is he now?

49:33.743 --> 49:35.043
He is gone.

49:36.110 --> 49:37.810
Why did he go, Mother?

49:39.343 --> 49:41.510
Because we both made a mistake.

49:42.443 --> 49:43.943
We did not trust him.

49:44.576 --> 49:47.476
We said he is lame-handed.
We wanted to merge the nomad groups.

49:47.610 --> 49:50.510
We said he won't stay still, he'll want
revenge.

49:51.710 --> 49:54.343
We turned our back to him.
We did it, Mother.

49:54.910 --> 49:56.510
We left him alone.

49:56.843 --> 50:01.076
Regretting losing him
does not help us now.

50:07.610 --> 50:09.643
-If you excuse me.
-Halime!

50:14.343 --> 50:17.310
I will follow every step you take.

50:18.576 --> 50:23.610
Do not make me give decisions
that I do not want.

50:49.010 --> 50:50.443
Mother.

50:53.810 --> 50:55.776
Halime is not strong enough to see...

50:55.943 --> 50:58.776
...Ertugrul's mistakes and show him
the right way.

50:59.610 --> 51:02.810
You want too many things from a woman
who could not be wife to his Bey.

51:04.476 --> 51:05.776
Gokce.

51:06.610 --> 51:10.410
She is the women whom Ertugrul
fell in love with.

51:13.310 --> 51:15.876
It will not change till doomsday.

51:42.643 --> 51:43.943
<i>Oh, Bey.</i>

51:44.843 --> 51:47.710
<i>I wish you were alive and here with me.</i>

51:50.476 --> 51:52.710
<i>I need you desperately.</i>

51:53.010 --> 51:55.010
Oh, Bey.

52:26.043 --> 52:27.643
What happened, Dogan?

52:27.976 --> 52:29.743
I could not sleep, Bey.

52:34.343 --> 52:36.643
We could not talk while Geyikli
was around.

52:38.710 --> 52:40.509
Your fight with Gundogdu...

52:47.476 --> 52:49.676
How is the nomad groups?

52:51.976 --> 52:54.310
Everyone heard what happened, Bey.

52:55.076 --> 52:56.943
They are worried about future.

53:07.676 --> 53:10.076
The gauntlet has been thrown, brothers.

53:11.676 --> 53:13.510
There is no turning back.

53:15.443 --> 53:20.076
But nothing will be same.

53:21.610 --> 53:23.076
I know that.

53:26.943 --> 53:29.043
Tugtekin is stoking the fire.

53:30.710 --> 53:32.910
He bears a grudge.

53:35.010 --> 53:36.976
He threatens us.

53:39.310 --> 53:44.643
I let them be until I stop
Mongol tyranny...

53:45.943 --> 53:50.510
...but I am at the end of my rope.

53:57.343 --> 53:59.443
What would we do in short time?

54:00.576 --> 54:02.076
Geyikli is chasing Mongols.

54:03.610 --> 54:08.110
Tomorrow, maybe for the last time
we go to nomad tent and free Abdurrahman.

54:11.510 --> 54:12.976
We take him and leave.

54:43.876 --> 54:48.610
This nomad group has seen
so many destructions.

54:48.676 --> 54:50.343
Think of it, brothers.

54:50.710 --> 54:56.743
We challenged to Ayyubids, so what now?

55:01.876 --> 55:03.576
Tell me, Clumsy.

55:04.410 --> 55:06.610
Did not your two brothers die?

55:06.876 --> 55:07.976
They did.

55:11.443 --> 55:12.910
What about you, Yellow Hun?

55:14.076 --> 55:19.110
Did not you bury your brave father
and brother?

55:19.410 --> 55:20.743
I did.

55:21.776 --> 55:24.643
So, why? Tell me.

55:27.776 --> 55:34.743
So Gundogdu and Ertugrul Bey
will be more prosperous and braver.

55:35.443 --> 55:40.743
Remember the wars
we went to let them marry Seljuk girls.

55:41.610 --> 55:46.876
Why? So, they would have royal blood
and they could found a state.

55:48.576 --> 55:50.343
Ertugrul Bey as Master Alp...

55:50.410 --> 55:52.876
...made us fight in battlefields
countless times.

55:52.943 --> 55:55.076
Is there anyone who did not hurt?

55:55.310 --> 55:57.343
Is there anyone who did not lose someone?

55:58.076 --> 56:00.476
He is right.

56:04.643 --> 56:11.610
But he saved our goods and women
not just ours but all Muslim world's.

56:17.910 --> 56:19.343
That is right.

56:19.710 --> 56:20.876
He saved.

56:21.610 --> 56:24.376
But why did we save?
What are doing now?

56:25.076 --> 56:29.810
What do have against
the largest army in the world?

56:30.676 --> 56:32.310
We have just fame.

56:32.976 --> 56:36.110
But we do not have any food.

56:38.710 --> 56:41.443
Other nomad tent is mocking with us.

56:42.876 --> 56:45.943
Why? Because Gundogdu Bey wishes so.

56:46.810 --> 56:48.676
Instead being together...

56:49.076 --> 56:52.910
...two brothers are fighting
with each other in the nomad groups.

56:54.510 --> 56:56.443
They disrespected to our traditions.

56:59.343 --> 57:03.310
You are the greatest warriors of world.

57:04.410 --> 57:07.476
Your name is heard even
by son of Genghis Khan, Ogeday.

57:08.510 --> 57:12.943
He sent you gold
that you could not see in your life.

57:15.310 --> 57:20.010
Now, think about it till tomorrow morning.

57:21.010 --> 57:27.676
So, real Alps who want to come with me
could take their gold...

57:28.410 --> 57:32.776
...and show the world a real warrior.

57:41.543 --> 57:42.910
Is that right, Gunkut?

57:47.876 --> 57:49.410
That is right, Hamza.

58:11.010 --> 58:13.010
Do not say a word, woman.

58:13.376 --> 58:17.010
Do truths hurt you this much?

58:17.743 --> 58:19.376
Selcan.

58:20.310 --> 58:23.443
You did not trust your brother
who you fought back to back...

58:23.543 --> 58:27.610
...but you followed your uncle and
Tugtekin who are led by a bitch.

58:27.676 --> 58:29.010
That is how it goes.

58:29.543 --> 58:33.810
Your brother hit you for the first time,
do you know why, Gundogdu?

58:33.910 --> 58:35.376
Because of you.

58:35.810 --> 58:38.843
-If you say another word...
-You will hit me?

58:39.676 --> 58:42.376
I will talk until you see what is right.

58:42.443 --> 58:44.110
Even if I would die, I will talk.

58:44.410 --> 58:49.076
You and your mother made a huge mistake
by turning your back to Ertugrul.

58:49.476 --> 58:51.343
Enough, women, enough.

58:53.376 --> 58:59.410
That ominous women will not rest
until she tricks my mother and Ertugrul.

58:59.576 --> 59:01.376
Open your eyes.

59:02.010 --> 59:07.776
We could not get out of the trouble
we are in by running and hiding.

59:07.843 --> 59:09.443
Let go of me woman, let go.

59:13.876 --> 59:15.443
Coward.

59:18.343 --> 59:19.710
You are a coward.

59:20.343 --> 59:23.743
You are scared of ambitions once we had!

59:24.076 --> 59:28.943
But do not forget that Gundogdu,
they have worse ambition than us!

59:29.010 --> 59:32.043
-Shut up, woman, shut up!
-Open your eyes!

59:34.976 --> 59:36.576
Gundogdu Bey!

59:43.043 --> 59:45.410
You are sick, women.

59:45.643 --> 59:47.410
You are delusional.

59:48.310 --> 59:49.876
You made me do this.

59:50.476 --> 59:52.743
May god give your punishment.

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.376
Take your filthy hands!

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:17.510
Sooner or later, you will show the
cloven hoof!

01:00:54.717 --> 01:01:00.283
<i>May God not let me live one day</i>
 <i>if I do not love you.</i>

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:04.350
May God not separate us, my brave man.

01:01:50.983 --> 01:01:51.983
Aykiz!

01:02:04.417 --> 01:02:05.617
Drink some water, brother.

01:02:37.283 --> 01:02:38.283
Bey.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:44.316
I cannot breathe without Aykiz.

01:02:52.117 --> 01:02:53.283
My life has turned into hell.

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:03.983
I missed her very much, Bey.

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:06.517
I missed her very much.

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:23.450
Aykiz Baci was a martyr.

01:03:25.383 --> 01:03:26.450
She is not dead.

01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:30.583
Know that she is alive.

01:03:33.517 --> 01:03:35.517
If God permits, you will meet her.

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:38.517
If God permits.

01:03:47.517 --> 01:03:48.617
If God permits.

01:03:52.583 --> 01:03:53.650
God!

01:03:55.983 --> 01:03:58.217
Please let me die a martyr in your path!

01:04:00.283 --> 01:04:03.350
God, let me have the honor of martyrdom!

01:04:04.517 --> 01:04:06.017
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:04:09.717 --> 01:04:10.983
Amen.

01:04:18.683 --> 01:04:19.983
I give you my word

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:24.283
that we will take our revenge
from bastard Noyan.

01:04:28.983 --> 01:04:32.917
May God not let us live if we do not take
our revenge from bastard Noyan.

01:04:36.383 --> 01:04:37.450
If God permits.

01:04:39.217 --> 01:04:40.317
If God permits.

01:05:43.517 --> 01:05:47.183
Wait for me bastard,
I will take your life.

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:23.017
Selcan!

01:06:24.383 --> 01:06:25.617
Selcan, what happened?

01:06:30.683 --> 01:06:31.917
Selcan!

01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:33.550
Selcan!

01:06:34.517 --> 01:06:35.950
My daughter, what happened?

01:06:38.117 --> 01:06:40.683
-Gundogdu.
-What happened to Gundogdu?

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:45.083
Gundogdu hit me, Mother.

01:06:47.383 --> 01:06:49.083
What are you saying, my daughter?

01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:51.383
My son would never lay a hand on you.

01:06:53.917 --> 01:06:58.683
I am an ominous, purulent wound
that he must carry, Mother.

01:06:59.617 --> 01:07:01.050
I know.

01:07:02.183 --> 01:07:06.450
When I pushed him, he stormed at me.

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:10.583
So, you deserved it, sister.

01:07:12.317 --> 01:07:13.350
Gokce!

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:29.683
My dear daughter.

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:33.683
I will take care of Selcan, Mother.
Come on.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:37.317
Alright. Come on, stand up my dear.
Come on, my dear.

01:07:41.217 --> 01:07:42.217
Come on.

01:08:09.183 --> 01:08:10.683
Your father is aware of everything.

01:08:11.717 --> 01:08:16.283
Gundogdu will be the biggest supporter of
your newly founded seigniory.

01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:19.117
Not Hayme or anyone else.

01:08:20.117 --> 01:08:21.483
What are you thinking, Mother?

01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:24.417
Gundogdu...

01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:29.417
...is a lonely and unhappy man.

01:08:30.183 --> 01:08:31.617
In his marquee, his bed is cold

01:08:32.083 --> 01:08:35.383
the cradle is empty and he is daunted.

01:08:37.217 --> 01:08:40.317
I see him grieving deeply every day.

01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:45.050
He is a miserable man who is
under command of his step mother

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:49.117
in the shade of his father's
dear Ertugrul.

01:08:50.483 --> 01:08:52.483
He cannot even confess it to himself.

01:08:53.417 --> 01:08:54.717
What are you saying, Mother?

01:08:55.917 --> 01:08:57.317
As I said to your father

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:03.350
if you act together with Gundogdu,
you would found the seigniory you want.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:06.717
Then, we would have a home.

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:13.450
And if you send Goncagul to his bed...

01:09:13.683 --> 01:09:14.950
What did you say?

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:17.417
If my brother Gumustekin's
daughter Goncagul

01:09:19.283 --> 01:09:21.217
becomes Gundogdu's wife...

01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:26.650
She is a real woman

01:09:27.017 --> 01:09:31.950
who can warm Gundogdu's cold bed
and fill that empty cradle.

01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:43.017
And when you take Gokce as your wife,
everyone will be delighted.

01:09:44.983 --> 01:09:46.117
Can I come in, Bey?

01:09:47.717 --> 01:09:48.917
Come in, Kocabash!

01:09:54.417 --> 01:09:55.417
What happened?

01:09:57.517 --> 01:09:58.650
Gundogdu Bey...

01:10:00.917 --> 01:10:02.083
...beat Selcan Hatun.

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:04.450
What are you saying? How did this happen?

01:10:06.117 --> 01:10:07.217
I do not know.

01:10:08.083 --> 01:10:09.583
But I barely saved his wife.

01:10:11.017 --> 01:10:12.250
Alright, you are dismissed.

01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:19.583
I told you, do not leave him alone.

01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:22.283
He is a lonely and grieving man.

01:10:23.217 --> 01:10:26.217
Back him up, guide him.

01:10:52.450 --> 01:10:54.650
My sins will not let me go.

01:10:56.650 --> 01:11:00.150
I will pay for them till I die.

01:11:01.983 --> 01:11:04.617
I will pay for what I did
both in this life and afterwards.

01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:09.250
I pray to God everyday but...

01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:11.517
Do not talk like that, Selcan.

01:11:18.283 --> 01:11:19.617
What has passed is past.

01:11:21.317 --> 01:11:23.383
You are more than a sister for me.

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:25.917
Do not talk like that, please.

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:28.983
But it is too late now, Halime.

01:11:30.383 --> 01:11:31.450
Too late.

01:11:33.983 --> 01:11:35.117
Selcan.

01:12:18.217 --> 01:12:19.217
God!

01:12:22.950 --> 01:12:24.017
Give me strength.

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:27.250
Give me patience.

01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:32.683
I am freed from my ambitions
with your blessing.

01:12:36.383 --> 01:12:39.917
I am freed from the soul-eating hubris.

01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:46.150
But I carry the burden
of my father's marquee.

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:50.583
Give me strength to carry that burden.

01:12:53.083 --> 01:12:54.650
Show the right way to Ertugrul.

01:12:56.717 --> 01:12:58.283
Show me the right way.

01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:04.150
I do not know what to do about Selcan.

01:13:06.183 --> 01:13:08.017
Show me the right way about Selcan.

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:11.317
Your strength is enough for everything.

01:13:13.317 --> 01:13:18.250
Save me from my vulnerabilities
and weaknesses.

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:21.450
Amen.

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.083
I heard what happened.

01:14:20.717 --> 01:14:24.117
We are responsible for our nomad tents'
future, brother. There is no escape.

01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:32.983
If we support each other, our nomad tents
would be out of the woods.

01:14:34.617 --> 01:14:35.617
Alright.

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:42.517
But you must have peace in your tent.

01:14:45.683 --> 01:14:47.017
If you are not at peace

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:50.583
you cannot find peace
when you are riding your horse.

01:14:53.383 --> 01:14:55.250
And you need to have a baby.

01:14:59.017 --> 01:15:02.483
Just like I need to find a woman
and get married.

01:15:28.283 --> 01:15:29.317
Stop.

01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:35.150
Duru.

01:15:40.183 --> 01:15:41.250
Duru.

01:15:42.016 --> 01:15:43.083
Duru.

01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:46.583
Duru!

01:15:49.683 --> 01:15:50.717
Bey!

01:15:52.317 --> 01:15:53.483
Are you alright, Bey?

01:15:57.717 --> 01:15:58.717
Bey.

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:10.083
-My wife.
-Does your late wife haunt your dreams?

01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:13.150
Yes, every night, Aytolun.

01:16:14.317 --> 01:16:15.450
Every night.

01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:19.717
Neither I have ever slept well

01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:23.650
nor I have woken up in peace

01:16:25.417 --> 01:16:27.550
since the day I married you.

01:16:30.483 --> 01:16:32.150
Whenever I close my eyes, I see Duru.

01:16:33.317 --> 01:16:34.583
Whenever I open my eyes, I see Duru.

01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:56.917
That night at dinner...

01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:02.950
Bey!

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:05.350
Bey!

01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:08.617
Bey, smell. Smell.

01:17:13.517 --> 01:17:16.150
Which night? What happened that night?

01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:24.583
The night when Duru's heart stopped
and she died in my son's arms.

01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:28.483
God, forgive my sins.

01:17:29.483 --> 01:17:34.417
Bey, tell me what is troubling you,
so I can help you.

01:17:36.183 --> 01:17:38.050
I could not tell you
all this time, Aytolun.

01:17:38.517 --> 01:17:39.950
What, Bey?

01:17:41.383 --> 01:17:45.717
We were at dinner on the night she died.

01:17:48.217 --> 01:17:51.250
She looked at me and told me your name.

01:17:55.983 --> 01:18:00.083
The last word she told me
before she died was your name.

01:18:06.083 --> 01:18:10.383
She looked me in the eye
and said "Aytolun."

01:18:13.483 --> 01:18:17.983
But why? Why would she say my name?

01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:20.250
She knew, Aytolun.

01:18:21.417 --> 01:18:23.050
She found out everything.

01:18:25.217 --> 01:18:30.317
She knew I came to see you
and met you in caravanserais.

01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:33.350
She knew everything.

01:18:38.383 --> 01:18:39.517
It is not possible.

01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:42.150
She told me, woman! Do you understand?

01:18:44.283 --> 01:18:47.183
Then she looked at me with pity.
Do you know what she told me?

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:53.083
She said "I keep quiet for the sake of
our son and honor of our nomad tent.

01:18:54.217 --> 01:18:57.483
But if you go to see that woman again

01:18:58.517 --> 01:19:02.350
I will embarrass you more
than you have ever embarrassed me."

01:19:03.450 --> 01:19:06.617
Then she said your name. Aytolun.

01:19:08.717 --> 01:19:11.017
There was more pity in her eyes
than anger.

01:19:12.217 --> 01:19:15.117
She did not hate me for sleeping with you.

01:19:15.983 --> 01:19:17.417
She felt sorry for me.

01:19:20.617 --> 01:19:22.283
Then, Tugtekin came in.

01:19:24.317 --> 01:19:26.083
He sat at the table.

01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:29.917
When she was about to have another bite

01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:33.050
her heart stopped.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:36.217
She died.

01:19:41.017 --> 01:19:42.083
Do you understand?

01:19:43.217 --> 01:19:47.983
She knew everything between you and me
while she was dying in my son's arms.

01:22:22.417 --> 01:22:24.583
How long will this sleep last, Ertugrul?

01:22:28.217 --> 01:22:30.450
When will you take up your mission?

01:22:53.283 --> 01:22:57.150
<i>How long will this sleep last, Ertugrul?</i>

01:23:03.017 --> 01:23:06.683
Oh, God!

01:23:09.183 --> 01:23:10.550
God, please help me.

01:24:03.117 --> 01:24:04.117
Here.

01:24:30.917 --> 01:24:33.650
You are real heroes!

01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:36.450
You proved it by coming here!

01:24:37.983 --> 01:24:43.950
You will save children and women
of Kayi tribe

01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:46.717
from imprudent Beys!

01:24:47.717 --> 01:24:52.550
As Kargin told you,
Konya will not be enough for Ogeday!

01:24:53.517 --> 01:24:55.117
He will conquer Constantinople as well!

01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:58.350
Then, he will advance on Central Europe!

01:24:59.217 --> 01:25:03.250
Now, do you want to be the warriors
who get their share of wealth

01:25:04.417 --> 01:25:10.350
or miserable men who challenge
the largest army of the world?

01:25:12.417 --> 01:25:15.283
What about our family?
What about our children?

01:25:22.383 --> 01:25:24.683
Noyan said that their lives will be saved.

01:25:26.283 --> 01:25:27.483
He gave his word to you.

01:25:39.083 --> 01:25:40.083
As I said...

01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:47.450
...you proved that you are
true warriors by coming here.

01:25:52.217 --> 01:25:53.417
These are yours.

01:26:04.583 --> 01:26:08.450
But if you want to fight for much more...

01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:15.050
...come with me!

01:26:16.583 --> 01:26:19.183
I am in to show Kayi's strength to world!

01:26:20.417 --> 01:26:22.483
-I am in!
-I am in too!

01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:25.283
-I am in too!
-I am in too!

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:31.583
Gunkut, you?

01:26:33.983 --> 01:26:34.983
I cannot!

01:26:35.217 --> 01:26:39.283
I cannot betray Suleyman Shah,
his glorious nomad tent and traditions!

01:27:05.917 --> 01:27:09.517
World's largest army is waiting for us!
Come on, Alps!

01:29:53.417 --> 01:29:54.417
Baycu Noyan.

01:29:55.083 --> 01:29:56.450
-Did you take care of it, Tankut?
-I did.

01:29:57.117 --> 01:29:59.017
The merchant and all the men
he has business with are dead.

01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:01.250
Good.

01:30:02.150 --> 01:30:05.717
Gundogdu will not be able
to sell their rugs and herds.

01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:10.450
We will see what his brothers will do
in nomad tent.

01:30:11.183 --> 01:30:14.950
Will they share their food
on long winter nights?

01:30:17.983 --> 01:30:19.250
When will Efrasiyab arrive?

01:30:20.083 --> 01:30:21.550
I sent word, he will be here shortly.

01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:31.017
My favorite thing in this
miserable life is fighting.

01:30:31.583 --> 01:30:35.550
But do you know what I enjoy more, Tankut?

01:30:38.483 --> 01:30:40.283
Conquering without a battle.

01:30:43.450 --> 01:30:46.217
Kayis and Dodurgas

01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:51.217
will fall into my trap one by one.

01:30:54.917 --> 01:30:56.550
I admire your desires, Baycu Noyan.

01:31:18.083 --> 01:31:22.550
He said "You grew up with us,
shared our food.

01:31:23.617 --> 01:31:28.217
But one day, you made
my white-bearded father cry.

01:31:29.683 --> 01:31:32.417
And the old, hoary mothers.

01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:37.250
You killed my brothers! My brothers!

01:31:39.550 --> 01:31:42.450
You trivialized white rugs.

01:31:44.117 --> 01:31:47.383
You left beautiful orphaned babies behind.

01:31:49.517 --> 01:31:53.117
When I catch you, do I let you go?

01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:58.083
Unless I draw my sword

01:31:59.283 --> 01:32:01.217
unless I cut your bloody head

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:06.017
unless your bloody head hits the ground

01:32:07.083 --> 01:32:09.217
unless I avenge my brothers

01:32:10.217 --> 01:32:13.083
would I let you go?"

01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:18.183
Even monsters like Argus

01:32:18.650 --> 01:32:21.550
and fire breathing dragons

01:32:22.317 --> 01:32:26.150
will be served right

01:32:27.117 --> 01:32:29.917
by brave Beys like Ertugrul Bey.

01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:35.050
Even, devils like Noyan.

01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:43.050
But the biggest monsters are among us,
my children, among us!

01:32:43.616 --> 01:32:46.083
Do not ever forget this!

01:32:48.017 --> 01:32:52.483
May God not let brothers and Muslims
fight among themselves.

01:32:54.150 --> 01:33:00.183
The ones who choose
to be united and together

01:33:00.983 --> 01:33:04.317
will have peace.

01:33:05.616 --> 01:33:12.616
The ones who choose to be separated
will lose face.

01:33:13.683 --> 01:33:20.350
May great God not make us need
the vile men.

01:33:22.650 --> 01:33:28.083
We prayed to our God with good intentions,
may God accept.

01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:34.683
The ones who say "amen" would be in peace.

01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:38.950
May almighty God forgive our sins.

01:33:39.517 --> 01:33:40.617
Oh my girl!

01:33:41.517 --> 01:33:42.683
Oh my boy!

01:33:43.683 --> 01:33:45.083
Oh my dear!

01:33:46.217 --> 01:33:48.483
Oh my children!

01:34:12.983 --> 01:34:13.983
Son.

01:34:15.717 --> 01:34:16.717
Son!

01:34:18.517 --> 01:34:20.150
-Mother?
-Get up.

01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:27.283
-What happened?
-Go and get your wife from rug loom.

01:34:29.983 --> 01:34:31.417
I cannot live with Selcan, Mother.

01:34:33.717 --> 01:34:36.017
She blamed me for our fight with Ertugrul.

01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:39.117
That is why you laid your hand
on your wife, right?

01:34:43.517 --> 01:34:45.150
It was a mistake, you are right.

01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:50.183
I know, a real man does not do it. But...

01:34:56.117 --> 01:34:59.150
Son, you are a Bey's son.

01:35:00.383 --> 01:35:02.583
If you behave like this,
what would people do?

01:35:04.517 --> 01:35:06.050
You broke our traditions.

01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:09.017
We do not lay hand on women
in our tradition.

01:35:13.117 --> 01:35:15.017
Now go and get your wife, come on.

01:35:15.683 --> 01:35:16.950
What about Ertugrul?

01:35:24.517 --> 01:35:28.650
If necessary,
I will send him and his Alps into exile

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:32.417
until this dark war is over.

01:35:36.350 --> 01:35:37.983
If God permits, I will not have to do it.

01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:42.150
Keep your eyes open.

01:35:43.417 --> 01:35:46.017
Do not let in the mistakes coming from
your uncle's marquee.

01:35:46.583 --> 01:35:47.950
Do not worry, Mother.

01:35:49.617 --> 01:35:53.517
Now get up, the girl is miserable
since last night.

01:35:55.117 --> 01:35:56.917
And make up your mind about her.

01:35:59.250 --> 01:36:01.483
You cannot solve anything by hurting her.

01:36:03.517 --> 01:36:04.717
You are right, Mother.

01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:07.950
Come on.

01:36:24.583 --> 01:36:26.050
Bey, Geyikli is still not here.

01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:29.617
I said he went to spy on Mongols.

01:36:30.283 --> 01:36:32.283
How will he spy on them, Bey?

01:36:35.683 --> 01:36:38.217
He knows these mountains like the palm
of his hand, do not worry.

01:37:13.317 --> 01:37:14.450
Come on, get up, Turgut Alp.

01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:25.050
I said, get up!

01:38:30.450 --> 01:38:31.483
Come on then, Alp.

01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:03.950
Bey, come on.

01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:12.450
Come on, Bey.

01:39:45.250 --> 01:39:46.483
There is no need, Turgut Alp.

01:39:48.650 --> 01:39:50.550
My hand cannot grab a sword yet.

01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:58.050
Come on, pack up.

01:40:38.169 --> 01:40:40.103
Turali. You are here.

01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:42.669
Welcome.

01:40:46.269 --> 01:40:48.303
Are you going to stand there and watch me?

01:40:50.736 --> 01:40:52.203
Or are you going to help me?

01:41:03.636 --> 01:41:05.069
You wonder what am I doing, right?

01:41:08.603 --> 01:41:12.269
I am making a steel glove
for Ertugrul Bey.

01:41:18.703 --> 01:41:21.803
So, he can grab his sword as he used to.

01:41:24.769 --> 01:41:30.536
So, he can avenge your parents and Aykiz.

01:41:51.603 --> 01:41:55.769
We dug one grave for each.
This is why we are late.

01:41:56.003 --> 01:41:57.069
I am sorry, Bey.

01:42:09.003 --> 01:42:10.003
Mongols.

01:42:13.569 --> 01:42:15.736
They have their finger on the pulse.

01:42:17.036 --> 01:42:20.203
Otherwise, why would they
kill a miserable man?

01:42:21.636 --> 01:42:24.269
They want us to starve in winter.

01:42:25.536 --> 01:42:27.503
This is going to be harder
than we thought, brother.

01:42:28.703 --> 01:42:34.203
It is but I have another question
in my mind.

01:42:35.203 --> 01:42:36.203
What?

01:42:36.769 --> 01:42:38.703
Apparently, Noyan will
cause trouble in winter.

01:42:39.869 --> 01:42:41.769
If Ertugrul is right

01:42:42.803 --> 01:42:45.303
will Dodurga share their food with us?

01:44:01.269 --> 01:44:02.303
Selcan Hatun.

01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:07.269
Apparently, you are not alright.

01:44:09.536 --> 01:44:11.036
Your patterns are uneven.

01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:16.003
You are not making it right.
Go to your tent and rest for a while.

01:44:18.636 --> 01:44:19.936
I will do it again.

01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:21.836
Leave it!

01:44:22.069 --> 01:44:23.269
Leave it!

01:44:34.169 --> 01:44:36.703
Apparently, Gundogdu Bey's anger
hurt you a lot.

01:44:38.703 --> 01:44:40.636
Selcan! Selcan!

01:44:46.236 --> 01:44:48.603
Go, pull yourself together
and then come back to rug loom.

01:44:55.903 --> 01:44:56.969
Help!

01:44:59.136 --> 01:45:00.536
Run, run!

01:45:00.703 --> 01:45:01.836
Help!

01:45:05.503 --> 01:45:06.669
Are you alright?

01:45:06.836 --> 01:45:08.136
He is a Kayi.

01:45:09.203 --> 01:45:12.503
Move! Move aside! Move!

01:45:13.636 --> 01:45:15.203
Do not stand up, you are hurt!

01:45:15.836 --> 01:45:19.036
Find Gundogdu Bey for me!
I have words for him!

01:45:19.803 --> 01:45:20.869
Alright.

01:45:21.036 --> 01:45:22.936
Run and get Gundogdu now!

01:45:27.036 --> 01:45:28.503
Hold on! Hold on!

01:45:33.169 --> 01:45:36.869
What are you looking at?
Go and get help, now! Now!

01:45:38.869 --> 01:45:40.836
Hold on! Hold on, Bey!

01:45:50.803 --> 01:45:52.003
So, you are going to help.

01:46:13.603 --> 01:46:14.869
Call Artuk Bey.

01:46:17.136 --> 01:46:21.136
Let me pass. Move aside. Let him breathe.

01:46:24.236 --> 01:46:25.269
Gunkut?

01:46:26.103 --> 01:46:27.803
-Bey.
-What happened?

01:46:29.169 --> 01:46:30.536
Bey, Hamza...

01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:33.169
Hamza?

01:46:37.536 --> 01:46:38.636
Hamza did it, Bey.

01:46:50.103 --> 01:46:51.536
He wanted to kill me.

01:46:54.869 --> 01:46:58.936
Kargin and he left with 11 Alps.

01:47:00.036 --> 01:47:02.669
-He left!
-Where did he go, Gunkut?

01:47:05.736 --> 01:47:07.003
To Noyan, Bey.

01:47:15.569 --> 01:47:18.069
They betrayed all of us.

01:47:30.503 --> 01:47:33.236
No, Hamza could not have done this.

01:47:34.536 --> 01:47:36.669
You got us into trouble, Gundogdu.

01:47:39.703 --> 01:47:43.136
Kocabash, prepare the horses,
we go after traitors.

01:47:43.636 --> 01:47:44.636
Yes, Bey.

01:48:05.136 --> 01:48:06.503
Move aside! Move aside!

01:48:21.803 --> 01:48:22.936
Come on, help.

01:48:23.136 --> 01:48:24.669
With the name of God, slowly.

01:48:27.803 --> 01:48:29.003
Slowly.

01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:07.169
What is going on, brother?
You came in without permission.

01:49:07.503 --> 01:49:08.736
Tugtekin was right.

01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:11.036
Hamza is a traitor!

01:49:11.569 --> 01:49:13.636
Probably, so is Abdurrahman!

01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:16.603
What are you saying, brother?

01:49:16.803 --> 01:49:22.969
Hamza and Kargin took Noyan's side
with 11 Kayi Alps!

01:49:24.736 --> 01:49:28.669
He also wounded a Kayi Alp
who tried to stop the treason!

01:49:29.003 --> 01:49:30.269
Sick bastard.

01:49:31.636 --> 01:49:33.303
People will follow him, Hayme.

01:49:35.069 --> 01:49:38.536
Kayi tribe is rotten to the core
but we have not seen it.

01:49:40.236 --> 01:49:44.636
You must put a stop to other people's
possible betrayals now!

01:49:46.303 --> 01:49:47.303
How?

01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:49.769
Execute Abdurrahman.

01:49:51.269 --> 01:49:54.669
If he confesses his crimes,
finish him off immediately.

01:49:55.536 --> 01:49:57.103
If he does not

01:49:57.836 --> 01:50:02.169
take his life slowly
and make an example of him!

01:50:49.103 --> 01:50:51.103
This way. This way!

01:51:42.636 --> 01:51:43.836
Something is wrong, Turgut.

01:51:45.569 --> 01:51:47.203
Something happened in nomad tent
while we were away.

01:52:07.203 --> 01:52:08.203
Bey.

01:52:09.636 --> 01:52:10.736
Tugtekin was right.

01:52:12.836 --> 01:52:13.969
Hamza is a traitor.

01:52:17.003 --> 01:52:18.003
What happened?

01:52:18.869 --> 01:52:20.503
He took 12 Alps to Noyan.

01:52:21.603 --> 01:52:23.036
Bastard!

01:52:24.103 --> 01:52:26.536
Because of him,
they think Abdurrahman is a traitor too.

01:52:27.703 --> 01:52:30.569
They want to execute him.
They are in headquarters talking about it.

01:53:26.569 --> 01:53:27.569
Beys...

01:53:29.603 --> 01:53:31.169
...this is going to end badly.

01:53:32.736 --> 01:53:33.969
We must take precautions.

01:53:38.503 --> 01:53:40.036
It is not too late
to take precautions, Bey.

01:53:40.936 --> 01:53:42.103
You still have a chance.

01:53:44.603 --> 01:53:47.736
How could you enter the headquarters
without permission, Ertugrul?

01:53:49.036 --> 01:53:51.669
How could you take revenge while you are
securing the justice, Uncle?

01:53:53.269 --> 01:53:56.603
Oghuz traditions do not let a brave Alp
pay for other's treason.

01:53:57.903 --> 01:53:58.969
Ertugrul...

01:54:00.703 --> 01:54:02.269
...we are talking about what to do
in here.

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:05.003
We have not decided yet.

01:54:06.703 --> 01:54:08.869
Beys will make someone pay for their rage.

01:54:10.869 --> 01:54:13.736
They look for a scapegoat.
The scapegoat will be Abdurrahman.

01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:17.803
I do not let this happen.

01:54:18.569 --> 01:54:20.669
This is all because of your obstinacy.

01:54:21.003 --> 01:54:23.103
Now you dogmatize!

01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:30.269
After you came, Alps got confused
and did not know who is their commander.

01:54:31.269 --> 01:54:35.203
Now, they turned their backs to Beys
and changed their side.

01:54:38.069 --> 01:54:41.669
I told you, Noyan would not wait
for his army.

01:54:42.836 --> 01:54:44.036
You did not hear my words.

01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:48.869
While you were hiding your head
in the sand, Noyan started the war.

01:54:58.036 --> 01:54:59.569
Do not force me into a corner, Ertugrul.

01:55:00.736 --> 01:55:02.703
I will show no mercy even to you.

01:55:03.303 --> 01:55:05.669
You disturbed the peace in nomad tents.

01:55:06.869 --> 01:55:08.303
Do not get in our way.

01:55:09.203 --> 01:55:10.903
You have no place in this headquarters.

01:55:12.269 --> 01:55:13.936
Get out, now!

01:55:59.103 --> 01:56:01.003
Stop it, Ertugrul Bey. Enough.

01:56:02.769 --> 01:56:04.669
It is a pity for your mother and uncle.

01:56:05.569 --> 01:56:09.269
Your uncle was always praising you
to the skies.

01:56:10.236 --> 01:56:12.669
Whenever he said your name,
he would be happy.

01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:16.936
Now, he cannot sleep and have anything.

01:56:18.236 --> 01:56:19.503
Enough is enough.

01:56:19.836 --> 01:56:23.803
Dodurga was united until you came back
from death.

01:56:25.736 --> 01:56:26.803
Enough is enough.

01:56:27.203 --> 01:56:29.836
Do not be stubborn, obey your Beys.

01:56:30.269 --> 01:56:32.269
This is what a brave man like you must do.

01:56:34.036 --> 01:56:35.103
Where did they go?

01:56:36.903 --> 01:56:38.836
You are stubborn, right?

01:56:39.769 --> 01:56:40.903
Where did they go, aunt-in-law?

01:56:46.869 --> 01:56:47.869
To north.

01:57:21.569 --> 01:57:23.169
Korkut Bey ordered us not to allow you
inside, Ertugrul Bey.

01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:24.703
You cannot enter the tent.

01:57:39.769 --> 01:57:40.769
Bey!

01:57:40.969 --> 01:57:43.969
We will get you out of here, Abdurrahman.
Be ready.

01:57:44.869 --> 01:57:47.803
Do not let me die
before I prove my innocence, Bey.

01:57:49.036 --> 01:57:50.103
Do not worry.

01:57:58.269 --> 01:58:01.303
Ertugrul Bey, do not make us do things
that we do not want to do.

01:58:02.936 --> 01:58:03.936
Leave.

01:58:07.236 --> 01:58:08.536
I will come back, Abdurrahman.

01:58:41.969 --> 01:58:43.536
Bey, let us come with you.

01:58:45.236 --> 01:58:48.236
Stay here. Keep an eye on Abdurrahman.

01:58:49.969 --> 01:58:50.969
Yes, Bey.

01:58:54.569 --> 01:58:55.569
Yes, Bey.

01:59:10.636 --> 01:59:12.236
There is something
I want you to know, Ertugrul Bey.

01:59:16.503 --> 01:59:17.703
I am listening, Halime Sultan.

01:59:19.969 --> 01:59:21.936
You mother is disappointed in you
as your brother.

01:59:22.769 --> 01:59:23.969
And even angry.

01:59:26.969 --> 01:59:29.003
But know that they are both feeling sorry.

01:59:31.136 --> 01:59:32.136
I know.

01:59:34.936 --> 01:59:36.636
I am not feeling resentful towards them.

01:59:38.136 --> 01:59:39.703
They do what they think is right.

01:59:41.269 --> 01:59:44.203
They think about sending you into exile
with Turgut and Dogan.

01:59:47.736 --> 01:59:49.136
That is what I want, Halime Sultan.

01:59:50.903 --> 01:59:52.703
I cannot do anything
in this nomad tent.

02:00:04.569 --> 02:00:05.603
Do not worry.

02:00:07.069 --> 02:00:08.969
Everyone will realize the truth
sooner or later.

02:00:21.836 --> 02:00:23.069
So, what is my role, Bey?

02:00:25.136 --> 02:00:26.669
Waiting patiently, Halime Sultan.

02:00:29.603 --> 02:00:30.669
Waiting patiently.

02:00:45.636 --> 02:00:50.569
Beys, headquarters will give a judgment
about Abdurrahman Alp.

02:00:56.703 --> 02:00:57.869
Do you have anything to say?

02:01:12.069 --> 02:01:13.069
Beys!

02:01:17.769 --> 02:01:19.269
Wise men of our nomad tents!

02:01:21.569 --> 02:01:22.903
You are making a mistake.

02:01:29.803 --> 02:01:32.803
Headquarters will decide whether
it is right or wrong, Wild Demir.

02:01:34.003 --> 02:01:35.903
The truth is obvious.

02:01:37.203 --> 02:01:40.103
No treason goes unpunished.

02:01:50.303 --> 02:01:53.636
Ayes for the execution of Abdurrahman Alp?

02:02:54.536 --> 02:02:59.669
On a day that Kayi Beys see fit,
the execution will take place.

02:03:09.836 --> 02:03:10.936
Shame on you!

02:04:22.969 --> 02:04:24.036
They went this way.

02:04:25.936 --> 02:04:27.069
They might have set a trap.

02:04:28.903 --> 02:04:30.069
Maybe with Mongols.

02:04:33.136 --> 02:04:37.769
Kocabash, go down and tell Alps
to follow us from up.

02:04:38.636 --> 02:04:40.936
-Maintain eye contact.
-Yes, Bey.

02:04:41.903 --> 02:04:43.003
Come on, to the horses!

02:07:24.603 --> 02:07:26.736
Ertugrul Bey, I was not expecting you.

02:07:27.269 --> 02:07:29.103
How could you betray them, Hamza?

02:07:36.803 --> 02:07:39.936
Someone must put a stop
to Gundogdu Bey's mistakes.

02:07:40.936 --> 02:07:42.103
That must have been you.

02:07:43.136 --> 02:07:47.536
But you chose to die instead of obeying.

02:07:49.603 --> 02:07:50.769
First, you lost your hand

02:07:52.869 --> 02:07:54.069
then stopped being an Alp.

02:07:56.236 --> 02:07:57.869
Noyan will not stop until he kills you.

02:07:59.036 --> 02:08:01.803
What did bastard Noyan give you
to get you betray your nomad people?

02:08:42.236 --> 02:08:46.703
I am not content with what I have
unlike your brother Gundogdu, Ertugrul!

02:08:48.103 --> 02:08:49.203
Now, lower your sword.

02:08:50.236 --> 02:08:54.003
Until the traitors are dead,
I will not sheathe my sword.

02:09:13.869 --> 02:09:14.869
Alps!

02:09:19.269 --> 02:09:20.269
Alps!

02:09:30.803 --> 02:09:32.503
I know your hand is crippled.

02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:39.736
Take down this man
who is attacking your Bey!

02:09:58.636 --> 02:10:00.869
I said take this man down! Take him down!

02:10:08.569 --> 02:10:09.669
Treacherous dogs!

02:10:18.269 --> 02:10:19.503
Treacherous bastards!

02:10:39.269 --> 02:10:41.903
The new Bey of your nomad tent
is me, Ertugrul!

02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:45.703
From now on, you will obey me.
