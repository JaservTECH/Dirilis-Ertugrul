00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 58 will start after 12:20 min.

12:20.342 --> 12:24.342
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:52.793 --> 12:55.360
We believed in you. We were
going to make you commander.

12:55.726 --> 12:59.560
You betrayed us, Ertugrul Bey! You brought
Ameer Sadettin's soldiers here!

13:04.393 --> 13:05.793
Kill Shahzada Ertugrul!

14:21.193 --> 14:24.326
It was good, brother.
We have not fought for a long time.

14:35.660 --> 14:37.826
What is wrong, Turgut Brother?
What are you thinking?

14:42.626 --> 14:44.660
We should not have left Bey alone.

14:47.193 --> 14:48.426
We did wrong.

14:52.526 --> 14:54.426
He told us not to go after him.

14:55.326 --> 14:56.693
What should we have done, oppose him?

15:25.826 --> 15:27.960
I told you so, brother. We are going.

15:43.859 --> 15:47.526
An eye for an eye, Fiery Boy.
Eye for an eye.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.593
A tooth for a tooth, a life for a life.
Blood for blood.

16:11.726 --> 16:12.893
Come.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.260
Did ember fall to your heart, Fiery Boy?

16:37.293 --> 16:38.726
You were quite week last time.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.226
Your woman's pain rendered you a man.

16:43.260 --> 16:44.926
Now, you are my own size.

17:36.460 --> 17:38.293
-Turgut!
-Your order, Bey.

17:38.393 --> 17:40.193
Take Yigit. Yigit, come.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.793
I see your eyes are on your woman.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.460
You wish to go to her at once.

18:45.293 --> 18:46.793
But it is not that easy.

19:06.726 --> 19:12.326
While your flesh is getting colder
you will writhe with your woman's pain.

20:33.326 --> 20:35.460
I have been waiting for this day
for so long, Fiery Boy.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.393
I have been waiting for this day
for so long.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.193
Die, Mongol cur!

21:34.193 --> 21:38.426
Do not rival in the battles
you cannot win, Fiery Boy.

21:39.626 --> 21:41.626
Now, you will die

21:42.526 --> 21:46.726
bellowing with the pain of your woman,
in the short time you have left.

22:15.526 --> 22:20.960
Noyan!

22:25.360 --> 22:30.926
Noyan!

23:49.226 --> 23:51.260
<i>You taught me to love, Bey.</i>

23:57.860 --> 24:02.860
<i>You taught me not to be</i>
 <i>a foolish child but a real woman.</i>

24:03.226 --> 24:05.793
And you taught me to be a real man, Gokce.

24:10.760 --> 24:14.626
That you do not become a Bey...

24:17.360 --> 24:19.560
...with a weapon but with love.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.460
<i>Even though you hate me</i>

24:23.160 --> 24:28.526
<i>even if I don't have as much worth</i>
 <i>as the dust on your boot in your eyes</i>

24:29.193 --> 24:31.326
<i>I will love you until my last breath.</i>

24:47.360 --> 24:49.793
I have loved you from
the first moment I saw you.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.926
And I will always love you.

24:57.226 --> 25:01.326
<i>If it is in my destiny to love and not</i>
 <i>to be loved, I will bow to my destiny.</i>

25:06.493 --> 25:09.226
From now on, we will be each other's
for eternity, Gokce.

25:13.193 --> 25:16.626
From now on, our destinies are one.

25:57.277 --> 25:58.810
Bey!

26:04.177 --> 26:05.177
Bey.

26:06.344 --> 26:07.444
Bey.

26:15.044 --> 26:16.144
He is alive!

26:17.144 --> 26:18.310
Gokce Hatun is dead.

26:20.177 --> 26:23.344
We must take them back to the tent.
Mount your horses! Now!

27:10.344 --> 27:14.210
Ertugrul Bey was right.
It was all your dirty games.

27:15.910 --> 27:16.944
Glory!

27:18.344 --> 27:21.344
In these lands, both
power and glory is mine.

27:22.844 --> 27:24.644
You failed to understand that.

27:27.444 --> 27:31.110
Now you will pay the price
for disobeying me.

27:31.910 --> 27:34.310
Damn you, Kobek!
Damn you!

27:36.044 --> 27:38.077
Bring him to me.
Hold him.

28:05.710 --> 28:08.677
His Ameer, Ertugrul
helped Shahzada escape.

28:09.810 --> 28:10.877
Very well.

28:11.977 --> 28:13.110
Very well.

28:14.244 --> 28:18.044
He is not a hero anymore.
He is a rebel now.

28:19.110 --> 28:21.144
We created a rebel
out of a hero.

28:24.344 --> 28:26.677
Go to the Kayi marquee at once,
Commander.

28:27.144 --> 28:30.010
Take your soldiers with you,
ask for Ertugrul.

28:30.344 --> 28:33.344
If they don't hand him over,
burn that marquee down.

28:33.710 --> 28:35.077
As you wish, his Ameer.

29:08.044 --> 29:09.177
Are you alright, Yigit?

29:13.877 --> 29:14.977
Come here.

29:27.810 --> 29:29.010
Are you alright?

29:29.777 --> 29:31.644
I'm fine, Ertugrul Bey.
Don't worry.

29:32.677 --> 29:33.844
It doesn't look so bad.

29:48.744 --> 29:51.377
I want to get rid of these clothes
Noyan's woman gave me.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.710
What woman are you
talking about, Yigit?

30:00.044 --> 30:01.277
Her name was Goncagul.

30:04.677 --> 30:06.344
She had eyes that looked
like a serpent's.

30:11.444 --> 30:12.644
Do you know her, Bey?

30:15.110 --> 30:17.344
She was at the heart of
the unrest in our tribe.

30:18.410 --> 30:21.077
-Turgut?
-I couldn't say it during the battle.

30:21.977 --> 30:24.110
It turns out that she's
Noyan's woman now.

30:26.177 --> 30:28.010
Bey, how did they find each other?

30:30.744 --> 30:31.844
Kobek.

30:34.010 --> 30:36.244
Obviously, it is Kobek who
brought them together.

30:39.410 --> 30:42.310
So they found each other
in the shithole, huh, Bey?

30:42.877 --> 30:44.944
Must have been a
match made in heaven!

30:48.210 --> 30:50.777
Are those two scumbags
worthy of mentioning like that?

30:51.277 --> 30:53.344
You're right, brother.
I am sorry.

30:54.344 --> 30:58.077
Apparently, it was that whore
who also pulled Bogac into this, Bey.

30:59.810 --> 31:01.044
You are right, Turgut.

31:02.144 --> 31:05.777
Bey, it is up to you make
something good of this evil.

31:10.110 --> 31:14.910
The den of these scumbags
will lead us to goodness, Bamsi.

31:15.910 --> 31:18.110
We'll keep an eye
on that den from now on.

31:21.344 --> 31:22.944
There is no going back to the tent.

31:24.310 --> 31:26.277
Kobek and his men
are looking for us everywhere.

31:28.644 --> 31:29.677
It's all my fault.

31:30.377 --> 31:32.844
You and my sister are
in danger because of me.

31:34.344 --> 31:36.710
Ameer Sadettin will
label you a traitor

31:37.644 --> 31:40.410
and he'll come after you.
It's all my fault.

31:41.277 --> 31:43.777
You proved that you live
up to your name, Yigit Alp.

31:44.444 --> 31:47.244
You sided with God
and the state.

31:49.177 --> 31:52.277
None of this is your fault.
Don't you worry.

31:54.177 --> 31:56.844
I don't deserve to live, Ertugrul Bey.

31:58.410 --> 32:00.377
Every moment I am
alive causes new troubles,

32:00.644 --> 32:03.010
and every breath I take brings
misery to my loved ones.

32:04.877 --> 32:08.844
It must come to an end.
I'm tired of running away.

32:12.977 --> 32:15.177
-Alps!
-Yes, Bey.

32:15.877 --> 32:17.310
We are going
to the Geyikli den.

32:21.177 --> 32:22.177
Go on.

32:26.777 --> 32:28.044
Come, brother.

32:52.077 --> 32:55.077
We've been going through
hard times for some time now.

32:56.344 --> 32:59.310
We saw neither the sun
that warms us,

32:59.777 --> 33:02.010
nor the rain that
feeds our crops.

33:02.944 --> 33:09.677
The constant fear of the
next misfortune to fall upon us.

33:11.444 --> 33:13.410
That's a neverending agony.

33:17.910 --> 33:21.277
That is why we
have to stand together.

33:22.244 --> 33:25.077
We'll be patient.
We will fight.

33:26.710 --> 33:31.110
This our only hope
of salvation...

33:32.310 --> 33:34.410
...for Gokce, for Yigit Alp,
for all of us.

33:37.844 --> 33:40.377
I don't know when
this misery will come to an end.

33:41.010 --> 33:43.010
However, I remember quite
well when it began.

33:44.944 --> 33:50.277
It began the day my dad and I trusted
Ertugrul's word and came here.

33:51.110 --> 33:53.210
The day we fought for the Sultan.

33:54.144 --> 33:57.677
If we'd stayed in Aleppo
instead of coming here,

33:58.810 --> 34:00.910
none of this would
have happened to us.

34:02.410 --> 34:07.977
Yet, we are now in
endless pain and misery.

34:09.010 --> 34:15.244
A peaceful life away from the Mongolians
is a distant dream for us now.

34:17.977 --> 34:22.744
On top of all that,
my illness

34:23.410 --> 34:25.644
taught me how painful it is to wait.

34:27.810 --> 34:32.377
My brothers are at the
battlefield while I am here.

34:36.177 --> 34:39.177
-God is testing us, son.
-Certainly.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.444
This is such a test that

34:44.210 --> 34:47.410
we have to be grateful for
the sorrow in the

34:47.877 --> 34:50.877
highlands where we seek
peace and quiet in summer...

34:51.010 --> 34:53.910
and for our quarters that provides
us with shelter in winter.

34:56.810 --> 35:00.210
Whoever passes this test

35:00.344 --> 35:04.410
will be honored
with God's mercy and grace.

35:07.377 --> 35:10.644
That's what Ertugrul Bey
taught me in my darkest hour.

35:11.744 --> 35:15.210
To confront our troubles
without hesitation...

35:15.344 --> 35:19.077
no matter how big they are.
To be grateful for our suffering.

35:19.844 --> 35:24.310
Suffering won't destroy us.
And we won't hesitate nor fear.

35:26.377 --> 35:29.010
Yesterday, it was my brother,
today it was Gokce.

35:30.777 --> 35:32.944
Tomorrow it could be me or my baby.

35:34.710 --> 35:38.277
We will think of Ertugrul who fights
to keep this marquee standing,

35:38.377 --> 35:42.677
and those who reached martyrdom,
and we will stand tall.

35:51.210 --> 35:54.077
God help them.

35:55.177 --> 35:58.010
-Give us the strength to endure.
-Amen.

36:00.910 --> 36:03.144
-If you'll excuse me, mother.
-Sit down, son.

36:05.444 --> 36:06.710
Sit down.

36:11.410 --> 36:15.877
Us, our marquee, our home
can't be destroyed by any kind of pain.

36:16.444 --> 36:18.277
Only we can destroy ourselves.

36:19.277 --> 36:23.777
Suleyman Shah's blessed marquee
will be destroyed only when we give up.

36:25.210 --> 36:28.344
Even though he is not here,
he lives in our hearts.

36:28.910 --> 36:31.777
As long as he is there,
there is no sorrow.

36:32.410 --> 36:35.110
Let's be grateful for what is
on our table

36:35.244 --> 36:37.177
and the flame burning in our hearts.

36:38.244 --> 36:41.277
Let us be grateful so we can
have the strength to endure.

36:45.777 --> 36:47.944
In the name of God,
the compassionate and merciful.

36:53.810 --> 36:55.077
Let's eat.

37:09.710 --> 37:12.410
Goncagul is there.
They killed her.

37:13.110 --> 37:15.810
What are you saying, Bey?
What could she be doing there?

37:17.810 --> 37:20.910
Apparently, she conspired with
Noyan and tried to do something.

37:24.344 --> 37:25.877
Now listen to me carefully.

37:26.844 --> 37:29.410
You stay here and wait.

37:30.844 --> 37:33.677
If I don't come back,
return to the tent at night.

37:34.277 --> 37:35.744
And bury the body.

39:40.077 --> 39:43.977
<i>Sadettin, you think you are clever.</i>

39:44.677 --> 39:48.844
<i>So you make Fiery Boy my prey,</i>
 <i>and me Sungurtekin's.</i>

39:48.977 --> 39:50.977
<i>I will make you pay for this.</i>

40:04.910 --> 40:06.344
There is no word from her.

40:09.044 --> 40:11.177
I'm so worried about what
that scumbag could

40:11.244 --> 40:13.410
do to my sister.

40:19.877 --> 40:24.977
Selcan. Don't you worry.
Tugtekin Bey will save her

40:25.110 --> 40:29.244
just like I saved you
from that heathen once.

40:30.110 --> 40:31.277
If God permits.

40:40.310 --> 40:43.877
Ameer Sadettin's commander
is here, Mother Hayme.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.377
He wants to see you.

40:47.277 --> 40:48.444
Send him in.

40:52.310 --> 40:55.110
Let's see what he has
to tell me this time.

41:06.710 --> 41:08.677
We are looking for Ertugrul Bey.
Where is he?

41:09.977 --> 41:11.777
Why are you looking for Ertugrul Bey?

41:12.210 --> 41:14.210
What does Ameer Sadettin
want from my son?

41:14.444 --> 41:17.244
His Ameer has sentenced
Ertugrul Bey to death.

41:21.110 --> 41:23.744
What are you saying, commander?
What's this all about?

41:26.644 --> 41:30.110
How dare you come here
for Ertugrul? What did he do?

41:30.177 --> 41:31.310
Halime Sultan!

41:39.144 --> 41:40.677
Tell him that

41:41.710 --> 41:45.010
I wouldn't even let you
touch my son's hair

41:45.244 --> 41:48.077
let alone kill him while he
is in my marquee.

41:49.777 --> 41:54.110
What does Ameer Sadettin
want from my brother?

41:55.044 --> 41:59.844
We raided Turkmen Bey's
headquarters with His Ameer.

42:00.344 --> 42:04.444
Ertugrul Bey sided with the rebels
and fought against us.

42:04.977 --> 42:06.277
And not only that,

42:06.344 --> 42:09.944
he also helped Shahzada escape,
whom Sultan had sentenced to death.

42:11.310 --> 42:14.944
His Ameer wants them both dead
soon as they are found.

42:21.044 --> 42:23.010
We were ordered to search
your marquee and the nomad tent.

42:23.110 --> 42:26.677
If you resist, you will all receive
the same treatment.

42:27.277 --> 42:29.877
As if it was not enough that you
threatened Ertugrul Bey,

42:29.944 --> 42:31.677
now you threaten us too, is that so?

42:31.810 --> 42:33.877
Halime Sultan, go back inside.

42:38.010 --> 42:41.010
My son is not in the tent.

42:41.844 --> 42:43.944
Go ahead and search it if you want to.

42:44.677 --> 42:47.310
We'll keep quiet out of
respect for our state.

42:47.410 --> 42:50.077
However, don't assume that
it will always be like this.

42:51.877 --> 42:54.144
One day we will also have our say.

42:56.144 --> 42:57.244
You two, look inside.

43:01.244 --> 43:02.710
Ask for permission first.

43:05.044 --> 43:07.977
Commander, put that sword back in.

43:15.144 --> 43:16.677
Selcan, let him in.

43:20.377 --> 43:21.677
Go ahead.

43:31.244 --> 43:34.177
As you can see,
my brother is not here.

43:35.110 --> 43:36.310
I only performed my duty.

43:36.777 --> 43:39.377
If your duty is over, get the
hell out of our marquee.

43:49.644 --> 43:51.344
Did you see what you had to,
commander?

43:53.310 --> 43:56.744
We'll search the other tents, too.
Tell your Alps not to stand in our way.

43:59.944 --> 44:02.977
-Thank God, Halime. They got away.
-Thank God.

44:06.677 --> 44:09.310
If God permits, we'll also hear some
good news from Gokce, Selcan.

44:10.710 --> 44:11.810
If God permits.

44:12.877 --> 44:14.744
-Abdurrahman.
-Yes, Mother Hayme.

44:14.910 --> 44:19.710
Let the Alps know. The commander
can look everywhere

44:19.844 --> 44:23.210
to make sure that Ertugrul
isn't in the nomad tents.

44:23.777 --> 44:25.244
As you wish, Mother Hayme.

44:38.910 --> 44:43.410
So this is the man Sungur said was
innocent. That two-faced scum.

44:44.310 --> 44:45.944
Brother Ertugrul was right.

44:46.810 --> 44:50.310
He gained our trust only to betray us,
that Ameer Sadettin.

44:51.177 --> 44:53.910
It is time to go and talk to him
face to face.

44:54.677 --> 44:57.244
Gundogdu, get ready.

44:58.344 --> 45:03.644
Let's go to Ameer Sadettin's quarters
and see what he is up to.

45:03.844 --> 45:04.910
Mother.

45:06.210 --> 45:11.010
We'll go to the Ameer for Ertugrul's sake.
Keep your calm while we're there.

45:12.277 --> 45:17.444
You don't have to come with me, son.
I'll go by myself.

45:18.077 --> 45:24.310
I have a right to say a few words to the
Ameer for whom our soldiers died.

45:24.810 --> 45:27.077
They want my son dead.
Shouldn't I say something?

45:27.144 --> 45:28.910
Of course you should, mother.

45:29.244 --> 45:33.810
But I am talking about asking for what is
reasonable, and in a reasonable manner.

45:34.077 --> 45:35.677
Please understand.

46:16.444 --> 46:18.444
What news do you have
for me, Bogac Alp?

46:19.110 --> 46:22.644
Noyan killed Tugtekin and his wife,
his Ameer.

46:23.944 --> 46:25.277
Noyan.

46:27.977 --> 46:31.677
Hopefully, Sungurtekin Bey
will deal with him soon.

46:32.277 --> 46:34.677
However... Goncagul Hatun...

46:35.877 --> 46:37.044
What about her?

46:38.310 --> 46:42.744
Gokce Hatun killed her
as she was trying to get away.

47:06.977 --> 47:10.310
Patience, my boy.
Pain is always temporary.

47:16.944 --> 47:21.077
How could man appreciate joy
if there was no pain?

47:21.910 --> 47:26.110
If he knew the taste of pain,
he would never want joy.

47:26.444 --> 47:31.277
If pain wasn't the biggest blessing,
why would God give it

47:31.410 --> 47:35.010
to his most beloved subjects,
the prophets?

47:36.277 --> 47:39.377
Oh God, how mighty you are.

47:43.177 --> 47:47.144
The arrow is lodged in the wound,
but it's not so deep in.

47:50.310 --> 47:52.644
-Bring the cinder, son.
-Right away.

47:55.744 --> 48:01.777
May the dagger be the cure for this
young boy in the name of Almighty God.

48:05.644 --> 48:07.177
Bite this, son.

48:10.644 --> 48:11.877
<i>Bismillah.</i>

48:29.710 --> 48:31.344
-Geyikli.
-Yes, Bey.

48:31.744 --> 48:33.077
Go to the nomad tent at once.

48:33.877 --> 48:38.677
Let Artuk Bey know that Turgut Alp
and Yigit are both safe.

48:39.844 --> 48:41.777
My mother and
Halime Sultan should know.

48:42.077 --> 48:43.710
As you wish, Bey.

48:57.010 --> 48:58.810
I've been fooling myself all this time.

49:02.077 --> 49:06.277
I thought I was all forgotten.
I would live with the Kayis

49:08.277 --> 49:10.144
and grow up to be an Alp.

49:11.310 --> 49:13.677
I could reach martyrdom.

49:16.877 --> 49:18.344
But it was not to be.

49:19.710 --> 49:20.844
I saw it.

49:22.377 --> 49:24.710
I can't stay here anymore,
Ertugrul Bey.

49:38.910 --> 49:41.744
God who spared Abraham
from the flames,

49:41.844 --> 49:44.177
do not let this young Alperen suffer.

49:45.777 --> 49:47.844
With your name, The Healer.

50:01.410 --> 50:04.210
In the name of God!

50:10.844 --> 50:12.210
Oh God!

50:21.377 --> 50:22.877
Thank God.

50:32.710 --> 50:34.210
I can't return to the nomad group.

50:35.077 --> 50:37.344
Everyone knows what I did.

50:39.110 --> 50:42.310
Do not worry, Bogac Alp. I need you.

50:42.377 --> 50:44.244
We will return to Konya together.

50:44.910 --> 50:47.077
Stay with me until then.

50:49.310 --> 50:51.810
I would die for you,
his Ameer.

50:59.710 --> 51:02.710
His Ameer, Sungurtekin Bey
wants to see you.

51:04.644 --> 51:05.644
Send him in.

51:08.410 --> 51:12.244
Bogac, hide behind the wall now.

51:13.344 --> 51:14.444
Wait there.

51:15.110 --> 51:18.044
Let's see what news he has for me.

51:29.944 --> 51:31.777
Those damned Kayis.

51:34.044 --> 51:39.377
Their Alps are one problem,
and their women another.

51:55.744 --> 51:57.810
Welcome, Sungurtekin Bey.

52:00.110 --> 52:01.110
Have a seat.

52:03.844 --> 52:09.277
I hope you came to tell me you
settled the score with that murderer.

52:12.777 --> 52:14.777
I wish I could, his Ameer.

52:16.177 --> 52:18.310
Don't you tell me you let him
slip through your fingers.

52:19.377 --> 52:22.977
We waited for him where you told us to.
But he didn't come.

52:23.644 --> 52:25.810
-He didn't?
-No.

52:27.377 --> 52:30.310
That woman you said he was with.
I found out who she is.

52:30.777 --> 52:33.677
-Who was it?
-That serpent called Goncagul.

52:37.777 --> 52:39.244
You should agree that

52:40.010 --> 52:43.377
my brother Ertugrul was not
mistaken about Gumustekin.

52:45.910 --> 52:51.910
And apparently, Goncagul colluded with
Noyan to avenge her relatives.

52:53.377 --> 52:58.310
Perhaps Ertugrul has destroyed
everything I could use as evidence,

52:58.944 --> 53:02.677
while he was trying to take
justice into his own hands.

53:03.677 --> 53:07.044
You don't find what I said about
Gumustekin credible?

53:07.110 --> 53:08.177
I do.

53:09.744 --> 53:12.977
But there is something else
I saw with my own eyes.

53:14.377 --> 53:15.910
Your brother, Ertugrul

53:17.044 --> 53:21.844
placed his own head under
the sword of justice today.

53:22.444 --> 53:24.044
What does that mean, his Ameer?

53:26.444 --> 53:29.110
We raided Turkmen Beys' headquarters.

53:30.010 --> 53:31.744
Shahzada Yigit was there, too.

53:33.210 --> 53:38.044
Guess who chose to side
with the rebels

53:38.144 --> 53:41.177
and helped Shahzada escape.

53:42.177 --> 53:43.177
Yes.

53:46.310 --> 53:51.710
I personally witnessed what
Ertugrul has been up to.

55:20.344 --> 55:22.944
Are you the ones who raided the
Turkmen headquarters, soldier?

55:23.744 --> 55:25.844
-Tell me!
-Yes.

55:26.710 --> 55:28.910
Ertugrul. What happened to him?

55:29.810 --> 55:34.110
-He helped Shahzada get away.
-Sadettin couldn't do it.

55:35.444 --> 55:38.877
Let me go. I am wounded.
Let go, please.

55:44.710 --> 55:48.677
He destroyed all the
evidence I had.

55:49.744 --> 55:53.777
That's impossible. My brother
would never turn against the state.

55:54.844 --> 55:58.277
Stop defending Ertugrul,
Sungurtekin Bey!

56:04.844 --> 56:09.944
If you can't complete the task
Sultan gave you, then resign now.

56:11.810 --> 56:15.144
Resign, so that Shahzada Yigit
can be punished.

56:15.644 --> 56:19.044
God forbid, if Sultan Aleaddin arrives

56:19.910 --> 56:23.277
he and his army will be
punishing us all at once.

56:27.944 --> 56:31.977
You shouldn't think of the grass
your ox steps on, Sungurtekin Bey.

56:40.044 --> 56:43.710
I want you to know that I won't
abandon my task, his Ameer.

56:45.844 --> 56:49.110
Shahzada Yigit will be punished
as our Sultan has ordered.

56:50.044 --> 56:51.677
I don't doubt this at all.

56:52.744 --> 56:55.777
And I will bring Ertugrul to the
Sultan with my own hands.

56:58.310 --> 57:01.844
-You will see that he is innocent.
-To the Sultan?

57:05.277 --> 57:07.377
It's obvious that my brother
doesn't trust you.

57:08.944 --> 57:10.844
I cannot persuade him
to surrender to you.

57:11.844 --> 57:15.344
But I can persuade him to trust
the Sultan's justice.

57:19.710 --> 57:21.210
And what if he is not persuaded?

57:25.677 --> 57:29.777
Then he will share
the same fate with Shahzada.

57:40.877 --> 57:42.777
As you wish, Sungurtekin Bey.

57:44.377 --> 57:48.210
I trust you just like
I do the Sultan's justice.

57:50.210 --> 57:52.410
Ertugrul can go turn himself in
to the Sultan.

57:53.343 --> 57:57.677
So long as this matter is dealt
with in peace and quiet.

57:59.377 --> 58:02.877
And you perform the task that
the Sultan asked you to.

58:05.177 --> 58:08.177
Put out these flames that
are burning our state down.

58:10.044 --> 58:14.010
Find Shahzada and kill him.

58:43.910 --> 58:46.710
Artuk Bey. There is word
from Ertugrul Bey.

58:57.144 --> 58:58.177
Mother.

59:00.777 --> 59:02.344
Don't you worry.

59:03.010 --> 59:06.877
I have a few words to say
to that despicable man.

59:07.444 --> 59:12.077
You tell me not to worry but
Noyan is still at large.

59:12.244 --> 59:13.877
How could I not worry?

59:14.277 --> 59:18.077
Do not worry. He'll get what
he deserves if we find him.

59:26.110 --> 59:29.077
-Hayme Hatun, Halime Sultan.
-Artuk Bey.

59:30.177 --> 59:32.177
There is news from Ertugrul Bey.

59:33.244 --> 59:36.744
Shahzada Yigit and Bey
are both fine, thank God.

59:37.110 --> 59:40.410
They are safe with their Alps.
He wanted you to know.

59:41.010 --> 59:43.344
Thank God.

59:47.044 --> 59:49.710
It is time to talk to
Ameer Sadettin, daughter.

59:50.810 --> 59:53.244
-May you be under God's watch.
-You too, mother.

01:00:03.877 --> 01:00:04.910
Selcan.

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.810
Ertugrul and Yigit are safe.

01:00:11.777 --> 01:00:14.244
Thank God, Halime. Thank God.

01:00:25.744 --> 01:00:28.210
Selcan, sister.

01:00:30.144 --> 01:00:33.977
If God permits, Tugtekin Bey will
bring Gokce to the tent safely.

01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:39.210
If God permits, Halime Sultan.
If God permits.

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:09.677
You are a fool, Sungurtekin. A fool.

01:01:10.844 --> 01:01:14.377
You are too stupid to understand
Kobek is using you.

01:01:26.077 --> 01:01:27.310
Gokce Hatun.

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:31.244
Gokce Hatun.

01:01:36.277 --> 01:01:38.044
Oh my God!

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:50.177
Oh my God!

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:04.910
Gokce Hatun, what happened to you?

01:03:16.277 --> 01:03:21.177
Gokce Hatun, what happened to you?
Oh God, please help us.

01:03:24.944 --> 01:03:28.144
Where are you going, Gokce Hatun?

01:03:28.244 --> 01:03:31.677
Clear the way!
Let Mother Hayme get through.

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.144
Stand clear.

01:03:39.977 --> 01:03:41.410
We couldn't save them, Bey.

01:03:57.344 --> 01:04:00.344
-Gokce!
-God!

01:04:02.077 --> 01:04:04.310
God, please don't make
us go through this pain.

01:04:18.877 --> 01:04:20.144
Let me through.

01:04:59.444 --> 01:05:00.910
My girl.

01:05:05.844 --> 01:05:07.010
My girl.

01:05:18.644 --> 01:05:20.344
Is that my sister?

01:05:26.944 --> 01:05:28.310
Is that Gokce?

01:05:29.744 --> 01:05:32.344
Gokce. Sister.

01:05:33.244 --> 01:05:34.877
Look at your face.

01:05:36.677 --> 01:05:39.244
Your beautiful red cheeks
have turned snow white.

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:42.244
Gokce. Your sister is here.

01:05:45.044 --> 01:05:47.444
Your sister. Gokce.

01:05:48.877 --> 01:05:51.077
Gokce, please say something.

01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:53.977
We celebrated newroz together,
just yesterday.

01:05:54.244 --> 01:05:56.410
What did you do to yourself?

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:02.210
Selcan!

01:06:03.277 --> 01:06:06.444
Tugtekin Bey, what happened to you?

01:06:06.777 --> 01:06:08.777
Get up!

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:12.010
Get up! Wake your woman up!
Get up!

01:06:12.077 --> 01:06:16.044
Get up, Tugtekin Bey! Don't let them
take you away like this! Get up!

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:25.244
Gokce! Mother! Please say something.

01:06:25.644 --> 01:06:28.377
I will die for the tear in your eyes.

01:06:28.444 --> 01:06:30.110
Make her talk to me
and say something.

01:06:30.177 --> 01:06:32.277
-Selcan.
-Gokce.

01:06:32.744 --> 01:06:35.977
-Gokce, it is me, your sister.
-Stand back!

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:24.277
No!

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:31.677
Get up! No!

01:07:35.344 --> 01:07:36.777
He is alive.

01:07:37.377 --> 01:07:39.310
Let's lift him up.

01:07:43.377 --> 01:07:47.744
My sister is alive, too.

01:07:48.044 --> 01:07:49.644
Hold him steady.

01:07:50.277 --> 01:07:52.844
My sister is alive, too.

01:07:59.077 --> 01:08:03.110
-Don't shake him.
-Slow.

01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:07.310
Take him to the marquee.
Be careful with him.

01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:20.944
We will avenge your blood, Gokce.

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:25.710
Whoever did this to you
will have to pay for it!

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:34.344
Mother.

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:37.244
Halime Sultan, keep an eye on Selcan.

01:08:38.144 --> 01:08:39.244
Mother!

01:08:40.744 --> 01:08:41.944
Selcan.

01:08:44.344 --> 01:08:47.377
Get back! Don't you touch my sister.
Go away.

01:08:49.377 --> 01:08:53.244
My sister is not dead.

01:08:54.777 --> 01:08:59.310
Open your eyes for me,
my beautiful gazelle-eyed sister.

01:09:00.177 --> 01:09:04.110
-Open your eyes for me.
-Selcan, please.

01:09:05.977 --> 01:09:07.977
Gokce!

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:55.842
<i>I trust you as much as</i>
 <i>I trust Sultan's justice.</i>

01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:58.976
<i>Let Ertugrul go and surrender to Sultan.</i>

01:09:59.309 --> 01:10:03.409
<i>As long as this matter is dealt</i>
 <i>in peace and quiet.</i>

01:10:04.309 --> 01:10:07.776
<i>And you perform the mission Sultan gave.</i>

01:10:08.309 --> 01:10:11.176
<i>Quench the fire our state fell in.</i>

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:15.342
<i>Find Shahzada and kill him.</i>

01:10:37.842 --> 01:10:38.842
Father.

01:10:40.676 --> 01:10:43.176
My gallant father.

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:48.309
It was not in my fate to see
your face for the last time.

01:10:52.176 --> 01:10:53.976
I wish you would be alive.

01:10:54.742 --> 01:10:57.376
I wish you would show us the right way.

01:11:01.876 --> 01:11:04.476
On the one hand stands our nomad
group you entrusted us with

01:11:04.876 --> 01:11:06.376
and Ertugrul on the other.

01:11:07.909 --> 01:11:13.209
Our nomad group's future on the one hand
and Ertugrul's dreams on the other.

01:11:15.409 --> 01:11:20.842
Know this, I will not allow Ertugrul
shatter your trust.

01:11:27.376 --> 01:11:29.842
We could not find peace, Gokce.

01:11:30.776 --> 01:11:32.809
We could not see the light of day.

01:11:34.276 --> 01:11:37.209
We could not be happy
and raise our children.

01:11:39.309 --> 01:11:41.176
Now you wish to leave.

01:11:42.776 --> 01:11:47.009
Do not. Please. Get up.

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:57.109
Let your breath be mine. Get up.

01:11:57.442 --> 01:11:58.476
Selcan.

01:11:59.342 --> 01:12:00.809
Sister, do not.

01:12:01.909 --> 01:12:05.942
Gokce reached the rank closest to God,
the martyrdom rank.

01:12:06.809 --> 01:12:08.276
You are a martyr's sister.

01:12:08.909 --> 01:12:11.076
Crying does not suit you. Stay strong.

01:12:11.276 --> 01:12:14.409
Halime.

01:12:14.942 --> 01:12:17.376
Look.

01:12:19.009 --> 01:12:20.942
Would one die so beautifully?

01:12:32.076 --> 01:12:35.842
Who would believe she is dead? Just look.

01:12:35.909 --> 01:12:39.176
Look, would one die like this? Look.

01:12:39.376 --> 01:12:41.476
Would one die like this?

01:12:42.142 --> 01:12:44.276
She does not look dead, does she?

01:12:45.209 --> 01:12:46.709
Get up.

01:12:46.776 --> 01:12:48.909
-Get up, say something to your sister.
-Selcan, get up.

01:12:48.976 --> 01:12:50.909
-Selcan, hold on.
-Please, do not.

01:12:51.042 --> 01:12:53.142
-Selcan, sister, get up.
-I beg you.

01:12:53.276 --> 01:12:55.676
Do not bury my sister on black earth.

01:12:55.742 --> 01:12:58.276
-Selcan, sister, get up.
-Please, do not.

01:12:58.376 --> 01:13:01.909
Alps, take Gokce Hatun. Go on.

01:13:02.742 --> 01:13:04.276
-Please, do not.
-Selcan.

01:13:05.842 --> 01:13:07.109
Gokce.

01:13:09.376 --> 01:13:12.242
Do not let them bury my sister
deep in black earth.

01:13:12.676 --> 01:13:16.742
Say something, do not let them bury her.

01:13:20.842 --> 01:13:24.009
Do not let them take away my sister.
Say something.

01:13:24.476 --> 01:13:26.376
-Come, sister.
-Halime.

01:13:29.276 --> 01:13:31.442
Please Halime, say something.

01:13:51.176 --> 01:13:54.942
-It is in bad condition, Artuk Bey.
-We will do all we can and pray, Ishak.

01:13:55.209 --> 01:13:56.676
Give me hot water.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:07.876
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:14:08.142 --> 01:14:10.309
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim</i> ,
the compassionate and the merciful.

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:42.209
Gokce.

01:14:42.276 --> 01:14:44.942
How could they kill you, Gokce?

01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:46.809
How could they?

01:14:46.942 --> 01:14:49.442
How could they do it!

01:14:51.776 --> 01:14:54.809
How could they kill you? Gokce.

01:14:59.842 --> 01:15:02.342
What will I do without you? Get up!

01:15:02.409 --> 01:15:04.109
Selcan.

01:15:04.309 --> 01:15:07.076
Get up, please, get up.

01:15:07.209 --> 01:15:10.309
Get up. How could they kill you?

01:15:10.776 --> 01:15:13.076
How could they do it?

01:15:16.176 --> 01:15:18.842
Selcan. Please, get up.

01:15:19.109 --> 01:15:21.676
-Gokce.
-Get up.

01:15:21.742 --> 01:15:24.109
How could they kill my sister?

01:15:24.176 --> 01:15:26.342
Selcan, sister, come, do not do this.

01:15:26.442 --> 01:15:28.876
-How could they kill my sister?
-Come.

01:15:29.076 --> 01:15:31.676
Come, you will stay strong. Come.

01:15:31.742 --> 01:15:33.942
What will I do without my sister?

01:15:35.909 --> 01:15:38.242
What will I do without Gokce?

01:15:41.276 --> 01:15:43.209
You stay strong, sister.

01:15:56.442 --> 01:16:00.376
Come, Merchant Abdullah. Sit beside me.

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:04.909
Let us talk a little with you.

01:16:07.342 --> 01:16:09.242
We could not meet for quite a while.

01:16:13.976 --> 01:16:16.042
I have good news for you, Sadettin.

01:16:16.742 --> 01:16:18.109
Tugtekin is dead.

01:16:19.076 --> 01:16:21.009
And Gokce Hatun, what happened to her?

01:16:23.876 --> 01:16:25.776
Yet Goncagul Hatun died, too.

01:16:28.342 --> 01:16:33.742
And I laid his wife's body next to
Tugtekin, like a Turkmen rug.

01:16:35.942 --> 01:16:39.976
Gokce was supposed to live. I was
going to give her to Sungurtekin.

01:16:41.109 --> 01:16:44.242
It's bygone, Sadettin.
There is nothing to do.

01:16:45.242 --> 01:16:48.042
Did you not pamper that
fool Sungurtekin enough?

01:16:53.876 --> 01:16:58.476
As I heard, you let Ertugrul and
Shahzada slip through your fingers.

01:17:01.442 --> 01:17:03.676
If Ertugrul is still alive,

01:17:04.442 --> 01:17:07.309
then it means we still need each other.

01:17:19.476 --> 01:17:20.876
Where are you going?

01:17:21.809 --> 01:17:25.276
Inform Ameer Sadettin, Mother Hayme
and Gundogdu Bey came.

01:17:37.309 --> 01:17:41.109
I will send supplies and fighters
for you and your men.

01:17:42.042 --> 01:17:44.709
I heard you do not have much men
left around you.

01:17:47.942 --> 01:17:52.042
I will send you my best men.
But finish this business.

01:17:52.342 --> 01:17:54.276
Ertugrul's time has come.

01:17:56.142 --> 01:18:00.209
Apparently, you are afraid of Ertugrul
appearing before Sultan Aleaddin.

01:18:02.376 --> 01:18:05.409
He will not be able to appear before
Sultan Aleaddin, thanks to you.

01:18:06.176 --> 01:18:07.442
Is it not so?

01:18:14.142 --> 01:18:16.842
Mother Hayme and Gundogdu Bey
are here, his Ameer.

01:18:19.242 --> 01:18:20.376
Let them come in.

01:18:24.009 --> 01:18:26.409
-Hide now.
-A shrewd woman.

01:18:27.909 --> 01:18:31.442
She is trying to rip her son out
of your hands with her teeth.

01:18:53.242 --> 01:18:54.742
Welcome, Hayme Hatun.

01:18:55.042 --> 01:18:56.476
Here, sit down.

01:19:01.842 --> 01:19:04.842
Your soldiers came to my nomad tent
and searched for my son.

01:19:05.809 --> 01:19:08.742
I heard you are attempting
against my son's life.

01:19:09.409 --> 01:19:12.876
It is my duty to do
what justice behooves.

01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:20.442
Who tries to save him will have
the same treatment.

01:19:25.142 --> 01:19:28.976
We have no doubt you are
performing your duty, his Ameer.

01:19:29.442 --> 01:19:31.376
Yet I would like you to know this

01:19:31.676 --> 01:19:36.342
my brother, Ertugrul has no such
matter as revolting against state.

01:19:36.842 --> 01:19:40.109
Both he and Shahzada Yigit are innocent.

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:43.209
Then they shall come and surrender to me.

01:19:43.842 --> 01:19:48.976
They are not meant to be thrown in
front of the jackal, Ameer Sadettin.

01:19:55.842 --> 01:19:57.909
Know your place, Hayme Hatun.

01:19:59.242 --> 01:20:00.876
When time comes...

01:20:01.842 --> 01:20:05.276
...I will surrender my son to Sultan
with my own hands.

01:20:13.876 --> 01:20:17.376
When time comes, huh? What time is this?

01:20:19.276 --> 01:20:25.409
Ertugrul would never surrender
before he is done with Noyan.

01:20:46.476 --> 01:20:49.242
The greed for throne, rank, position

01:20:49.909 --> 01:20:53.276
brought many heroes to their knees
and perverted them

01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:57.109
yet this boy did not yield to his desire.

01:20:58.842 --> 01:21:01.676
May God destine a child like him to all.

01:21:04.209 --> 01:21:07.776
And may he keep Muslims distant
from the ambition of being mighty.

01:21:08.676 --> 01:21:13.009
May he destine us to regard all
our doings only by God's approval.

01:21:13.909 --> 01:21:15.009
Amen.

01:21:31.076 --> 01:21:34.242
Just as Kobek is the one who brought
Goncagul and Noyan together

01:21:34.942 --> 01:21:37.476
Goncagul is the one who brought
Bogac and Kobek together.

01:21:38.976 --> 01:21:43.842
With this, the only place she would
take shelter in is Kobek's lair.

01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:48.442
Until the time comes and
Kobek finishes her off.

01:21:50.309 --> 01:21:52.876
It is apparent where Bogac will go, Bey.

01:21:53.876 --> 01:21:56.209
It is, Dogan, it is.

01:21:56.476 --> 01:21:57.842
It is, Bey.

01:21:57.909 --> 01:22:00.142
And it is apparent where
we will walk all over them.

01:22:01.409 --> 01:22:05.309
Reach caravansary before sun rises,
keep your eyes open.

01:22:06.142 --> 01:22:09.942
Even if we cannot get in, Bogac
will come out, sooner or later.

01:22:10.176 --> 01:22:13.309
He will, Bey. And we will
swoop him when he does.

01:22:14.242 --> 01:22:15.809
Bring Bogac alive to me.

01:22:16.309 --> 01:22:18.676
Do it so there is no one left

01:22:18.842 --> 01:22:20.942
that does not know Kobek
and Noyan work together.

01:22:22.142 --> 01:22:26.176
Only this can save Yigit
and us from Kobek's game.

01:22:31.276 --> 01:22:33.309
You came to life, mountains' bear.

01:22:33.876 --> 01:22:36.042
I did, brother. I came to life.

01:22:36.242 --> 01:22:40.809
I get in a good mood only when
I chop heathens and beat traitors.

01:22:41.209 --> 01:22:44.676
Brother, we will down on their throat.

01:22:51.109 --> 01:22:53.176
Noyan killed Gokce Hatun.

01:22:54.309 --> 01:22:56.476
And Tugtekin is in the throes of death.

01:22:56.776 --> 01:22:58.209
In throes of death?

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:02.842
How could that be?

01:23:05.276 --> 01:23:07.042
Noyan kidnapped Gokce Hatun.

01:23:08.209 --> 01:23:10.142
To entrap Tugtekin Bey.

01:23:12.242 --> 01:23:13.909
You should know I am sorry.

01:23:14.476 --> 01:23:16.009
Two young people.

01:23:16.942 --> 01:23:19.742
Tugtekin Bey will get his health
back soon, if God permits.

01:23:19.876 --> 01:23:21.042
If God permits.

01:23:22.109 --> 01:23:24.009
You should know this

01:23:24.142 --> 01:23:29.109
my son will not be the only one to be
weighed in Sultan's justice scale

01:23:29.309 --> 01:23:31.142
you will, too.

01:23:32.409 --> 01:23:38.042
As our duty necessitates, we are always
weighed on that scale, Hayme Hatun.

01:23:40.176 --> 01:23:42.976
Sungurtekin Bey came before you.

01:23:43.476 --> 01:23:48.009
He, too, said he will persuade Ertugrul
to surrender to Sultan Aleaddin.

01:23:49.309 --> 01:23:53.242
I told him, too, whether me
or Sultan Aleaddin.

01:23:54.042 --> 01:23:59.076
As long as this matter is dealt in peace
and justice is served.

01:23:59.942 --> 01:24:05.109
Sultan assigned you to ensure
order in these lands

01:24:06.109 --> 01:24:11.476
we fought on for the love of God,
we gave many martyrs for.

01:24:13.142 --> 01:24:15.442
So be it. As he pleases.

01:24:16.042 --> 01:24:21.142
However since you came,
neither my nomad group

01:24:21.976 --> 01:24:26.442
nor others are in order or in peace.

01:24:29.009 --> 01:24:31.209
Sultan will surely know about this.

01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:32.742
Mother.

01:24:33.909 --> 01:24:35.309
From now on,

01:24:35.942 --> 01:24:41.942
do not let your soldiers
come and disturb us again.

01:24:43.009 --> 01:24:44.776
I will keep my promise.

01:24:44.909 --> 01:24:48.442
I will surrender my son to Sultan
with my own hands.

01:24:51.809 --> 01:24:53.342
And you should know it as it is.

01:25:21.776 --> 01:25:23.342
What a woman.

01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:26.476
He brought the mighty Ameer to his knees.

01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:29.209
Time will show that.

01:25:30.976 --> 01:25:33.009
Besides, Tugtekin was alive.

01:25:33.942 --> 01:25:35.376
What is this, Noyan?

01:25:36.442 --> 01:25:41.476
Do not worry. I carved him so well,
he will not make it to morning.

01:25:42.342 --> 01:25:44.842
You can go and weep at his funeral.

01:25:45.009 --> 01:25:47.342
You can even mourn for him if you like.

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:53.009
As I said, if Ertugrul
appears before Sultan

01:25:53.942 --> 01:25:56.009
you will not get a wink of sleep
at nights.

01:25:57.276 --> 01:25:59.142
I will wait for Bogac and your men.

01:26:00.042 --> 01:26:01.942
Then I will go and kill Ertugrul.

01:26:03.076 --> 01:26:05.742
Do not pull something on me, Sadettin.

01:26:06.976 --> 01:26:08.876
If you pull something on me,

01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:13.076
no matter where you go,
I will find you.

01:26:14.842 --> 01:26:16.076
Goodbye.

01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:20.409
Your shaman.

01:26:23.909 --> 01:26:24.909
Ulubilge.

01:26:26.909 --> 01:26:30.776
Ertugrul and his men killed him
while they were escaping.

01:26:56.242 --> 01:26:57.876
May God heal you.

01:27:00.442 --> 01:27:02.976
What arrow could hurt a lion like you?

01:27:04.909 --> 01:27:06.776
Even a scar would not be left soon.

01:27:21.776 --> 01:27:25.242
I will check your wound again tomorrow,
before I leave to Ahlat.

01:27:25.342 --> 01:27:27.042
Thank you, Hazrat Arabi.

01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:37.842
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:27:38.042 --> 01:27:39.309
And peace be upon you.

01:27:45.976 --> 01:27:46.976
Bey.

01:27:48.342 --> 01:27:50.309
The situation is no good.

01:27:52.209 --> 01:27:53.209
Speak, Geyikli.

01:27:54.809 --> 01:27:57.242
-I do not know how to tell, Bey.
-Geyikli.

01:27:57.976 --> 01:27:59.476
Are you testing my patience?

01:28:09.476 --> 01:28:10.842
Gokce Hatun.

01:28:13.209 --> 01:28:14.476
She is dead, Bey.

01:28:17.142 --> 01:28:18.809
Noyan killed her.

01:28:30.676 --> 01:28:35.142
And Tugtekin Bey had been
struggling to survive.

01:28:36.876 --> 01:28:38.309
He is badly wounded.

01:28:40.776 --> 01:28:42.009
Gokce.

01:28:44.209 --> 01:28:45.709
Innocent Gokce.

01:28:49.076 --> 01:28:51.776
Before they even get enough of
each other with Tugtekin.

01:28:55.942 --> 01:28:57.876
And my brother Tugtekin.

01:29:00.076 --> 01:29:01.742
Gallant Tugtekin.

01:29:03.676 --> 01:29:07.976
I told him, "Noyan will pull you
to his cobweb, hold your rage."

01:29:15.842 --> 01:29:17.209
Noyan.

01:29:19.009 --> 01:29:20.309
Sadettin.

01:29:22.376 --> 01:29:24.676
I will send you to hell.

01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:30.076
I will not stop until tyrants
kneel down before aggrieved ones.

01:29:31.209 --> 01:29:32.909
Be strong, child.

01:29:33.276 --> 01:29:35.942
Be strong even if you are
tyrannized a thousand times.

01:29:37.409 --> 01:29:39.442
Do not think it will go on this way.

01:29:40.776 --> 01:29:42.876
As Prophet Ali said

01:29:44.176 --> 01:29:47.076
"The day the aggrieved avenges

01:29:47.876 --> 01:29:51.742
the tyrant will surely be more arduous
than the day tyrant tormented."

01:29:54.376 --> 01:29:56.676
God is by faithful's side.

01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:15.909
-I am going to nomad tent quickly.
-Bey.

01:30:16.776 --> 01:30:18.942
Ameer Sadettin would not have
left out the nomad tent.

01:30:19.376 --> 01:30:22.242
-His soldiers must be in the nomad tent.
-Do not worry.

01:30:23.876 --> 01:30:25.209
I will go and return quickly.

01:30:41.342 --> 01:30:46.409
Rosebuds before her marquee

01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:52.442
The food inside, bleeding

01:30:55.242 --> 01:30:59.909
Gokce lies, sleeping

01:31:01.309 --> 01:31:06.342
Her neck, soaked in scarlet blood

01:31:08.176 --> 01:31:12.909
Could this child be buried

01:31:14.376 --> 01:31:20.142
Could this child be buried

01:31:28.976 --> 01:31:33.876
Came the dark news

01:31:35.842 --> 01:31:38.909
Turned its face

01:31:40.676 --> 01:31:43.276
The ill fate

01:31:45.209 --> 01:31:51.042
Both tribes weep together

01:31:52.009 --> 01:31:58.009
What would Gokce Hatun do

01:31:59.076 --> 01:32:04.809
Could one die this beautifully

01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:12.676
Could one bury such a beauty

01:32:16.809 --> 01:32:22.109
Two graves on the path

01:32:23.176 --> 01:32:28.709
The wind blows into dust

01:32:30.409 --> 01:32:35.976
And there you lay, Bey

01:32:37.709 --> 01:32:43.176
Your flesh bleeds, eyes weep

01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:50.376
Could this woman be buried

01:32:51.476 --> 01:32:57.109
Could this woman be buried

01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:30.376
Tugtekin.

01:33:42.742 --> 01:33:46.309
-What state is he in, Artuk Bey?
-Unfortunately, it is not good, Bey.

01:33:49.042 --> 01:33:53.076
That Noyan dog thrust the sword
to his stomach so dexterously

01:33:53.342 --> 01:33:57.776
he wanted him not to die,
to suffer, on purpose.

01:34:03.942 --> 01:34:05.376
And Gokce Sister?

01:34:06.309 --> 01:34:07.876
How did he kill her?

01:34:08.276 --> 01:34:11.142
He killed Gokce Hatun
by cutting her throat.

01:34:14.676 --> 01:34:17.076
I do not know if it is a consolation

01:34:17.809 --> 01:34:20.042
yet it is apparent she died
without suffering.

01:34:46.242 --> 01:34:47.809
Where is my mother, Artuk Bey?

01:34:57.776 --> 01:35:03.342
News on Ertugrul Bey came first but
then on Tugtekin Bey and Gokce Hatun.

01:35:04.276 --> 01:35:07.009
She went to see Ameer Sadettin
with Gundogdu Bey.

01:35:07.076 --> 01:35:10.176
-What is it you say, Artuk Bey?
-She was so furious, Bey.

01:35:11.376 --> 01:35:12.409
My God.

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:17.342
Selcan. What about Selcan Hatun?

01:35:17.442 --> 01:35:18.776
How is she?

01:35:18.942 --> 01:35:24.342
Selcan Hatun was quite shattered. I hope
it will not damage her pregnancy again.

01:35:41.442 --> 01:35:44.776
Gokce Sister. I am wretched by our loss.

01:35:47.409 --> 01:35:49.876
May God give us all patience, son.

01:35:50.809 --> 01:35:55.076
May God give us the chance
to avenge their blood.

01:35:55.342 --> 01:35:56.342
Amen.

01:35:59.076 --> 01:36:00.742
How is Tugtekin?

01:36:02.776 --> 01:36:04.409
He is not good, mother.

01:36:10.442 --> 01:36:11.676
Gokce...

01:36:13.242 --> 01:36:15.709
She killed Goncagul before she died.

01:36:18.742 --> 01:36:20.276
How do you know this?

01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:25.042
I learned Noyan's place
from Ameer Sadettin.

01:36:27.309 --> 01:36:28.476
We lied in wait.

01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:30.476
But he did not come.

01:36:31.842 --> 01:36:34.909
When I went and looked I saw the body
of that serpent named Goncagul.

01:36:36.076 --> 01:36:37.876
Obviously, she conspired with Noyan.

01:36:39.442 --> 01:36:42.476
Since Noyan would not kill the woman
he alined himself with

01:36:42.976 --> 01:36:45.276
Gokce must have found a chance while
she was trying to escape

01:36:45.342 --> 01:36:46.942
and killed Goncagul.

01:36:51.742 --> 01:36:54.376
And Noyan must have caught Gokce
while she was escaping.

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:56.242
Sungur.

01:36:58.076 --> 01:37:00.876
My mother and I are coming from
Ameer Sadettin's place.

01:37:04.009 --> 01:37:07.276
He told us what you talked about Ertugrul.

01:37:07.676 --> 01:37:09.842
There is no other way than
to surrender Ertugrul

01:37:10.009 --> 01:37:11.876
to Sultan Aleaddin's justice, mother.

01:37:15.442 --> 01:37:20.076
Halime Sultan, I know my brother
Ertugrul is not a revolter.

01:37:22.142 --> 01:37:24.676
Sultan will know and understand this, too.

01:37:25.876 --> 01:37:30.042
We cannot let Ertugrul dies out of
his fury towards Ameer Sadettin.

01:37:31.076 --> 01:37:33.142
We must convince Ertugrul into this.

01:37:34.676 --> 01:37:36.842
And we shall surrender
Shahzada Yigit to Sultan, too.

01:37:37.676 --> 01:37:39.076
Do you understand me?

01:37:39.876 --> 01:37:41.976
Ertugrul Bey would not surrender.

01:37:43.876 --> 01:37:45.909
What will he do if not surrender?

01:37:46.442 --> 01:37:49.976
Should he live as a refugee on a mountain
with Shahzada Yigit for all his life?

01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:53.942
Should they be entrapped and die some day?
Is this what you want?

01:37:56.076 --> 01:37:58.309
You have been apart from
your brother for years.

01:37:59.042 --> 01:38:00.909
It is obvious you do not know him well.

01:38:02.842 --> 01:38:05.942
Ertugrul would not surrender to Sultan
before he brings us Noyan

01:38:06.109 --> 01:38:09.742
and Ameer Sadettin, who
holds Noyan's leash in his hands.

01:38:11.142 --> 01:38:13.309
Do you not know these words of yours

01:38:13.376 --> 01:38:15.809
will cause Ertugrul's death,
Halime Sultan?

01:38:15.909 --> 01:38:17.176
And you?

01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:19.942
Do you not know that you trail
along after Ameer Sadettin

01:38:20.042 --> 01:38:22.209
and put your brother's life in danger?

01:38:22.276 --> 01:38:23.376
Enough!

01:38:24.109 --> 01:38:25.942
Enough, what are you doing?

01:38:26.742 --> 01:38:28.942
Is it time to talk these, now?

01:38:30.742 --> 01:38:33.809
Will you go through these
hard times like this?

01:38:34.376 --> 01:38:36.742
Is this how you will secure our unity?

01:38:46.742 --> 01:38:49.042
Dodurga Beys wish to see you,
Mother Hayme.

01:38:50.676 --> 01:38:51.776
Let them come in.

01:39:06.476 --> 01:39:08.042
I am sorry for your loss, Mother Hayme.

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:09.476
I am sorry for your loss, Mother Hayme.

01:39:09.809 --> 01:39:11.276
It is all our loss.

01:39:11.909 --> 01:39:13.809
What do you want to talk to me about?

01:39:14.442 --> 01:39:18.409
We want you to know we will gather
the headquarters tomorrow, Mother Hayme.

01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:24.976
We do not want to leave
the nomad group without a leader.

01:39:28.176 --> 01:39:29.909
Look at yourselves.

01:39:32.376 --> 01:39:37.242
You are fighting with each other like
carrion crows to get in the marquee.

01:39:39.876 --> 01:39:42.942
You set your eyes on your Bey's
position before he even died!

01:39:44.776 --> 01:39:46.376
Shame on you!

01:39:47.409 --> 01:39:48.942
Get out of my sight!

01:39:51.176 --> 01:39:52.442
I said, get out!

01:40:53.876 --> 01:40:59.742
Did I not extend you the hand of mercy?

01:41:26.375 --> 01:41:29.142
Did I not say the rebellion...

01:41:31.875 --> 01:41:33.476
...would be in calamity?

01:41:55.342 --> 01:41:59.709
I, mighty Ameer Sadettin Kobek...

01:42:01.476 --> 01:42:04.342
...did I not show mercy to you?

01:42:10.276 --> 01:42:11.442
What happened?

01:42:22.876 --> 01:42:24.042
What happened?

01:42:28.376 --> 01:42:31.742
Your Beys perished along
with many of your Alps.

01:42:35.476 --> 01:42:37.109
What good did it do?

01:42:40.209 --> 01:42:41.276
Nothing.

01:42:44.376 --> 01:42:45.809
A big nothing.

01:42:55.676 --> 01:42:58.942
If it happened and Sultan Aleaddin
came, what would happen?

01:43:05.409 --> 01:43:07.742
He would not let any of you live!

01:43:08.209 --> 01:43:09.809
Forgive us, his Ameer.

01:43:10.142 --> 01:43:12.142
We could not stop our nomad groups' Beys.

01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:14.809
We told them not to revolt but
we could not make them listen.

01:43:14.909 --> 01:43:17.009
They were blinded by anger, his Ameer.

01:43:17.909 --> 01:43:20.976
We could not stop it, his Ameer.
Grant us to our children.

01:43:21.076 --> 01:43:22.409
Forgive us, his Ameer.

01:43:44.176 --> 01:43:46.909
Why are you silent, Karacabey?

01:43:49.376 --> 01:43:54.042
We could not stop the Beys
in our headquarters, his Ameer.

01:43:54.209 --> 01:43:56.109
You are right to say what you will.

01:43:57.176 --> 01:44:01.342
We surrender our heads to your might.

01:44:03.742 --> 01:44:08.842
Was it necessary for this many
ones to die, Karacabey?

01:44:12.309 --> 01:44:14.109
It was not, his Ameer.

01:44:14.876 --> 01:44:20.042
You should know, me and our nomad
group will always be at your service.

01:44:32.142 --> 01:44:34.876
I will choose your nomad
groups' Beys henceforth.

01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:40.742
And your part will be to respect
my decisions at the headquarters.

01:44:41.442 --> 01:44:46.742
Who does not respect will pay its price
along with his nomad group.

01:44:48.942 --> 01:44:54.376
Now, is there anyone
to talk after my words?

01:44:54.942 --> 01:44:56.776
No, his Ameer.

01:44:57.042 --> 01:44:58.376
As you please.

01:45:02.342 --> 01:45:03.776
Karacabey?

01:45:03.909 --> 01:45:06.242
Whoever does not obey your order...

01:45:07.442 --> 01:45:10.009
...will find me before him first,
his Ameer.

01:45:12.976 --> 01:45:14.009
Very well.

01:45:17.676 --> 01:45:18.742
Very well.

01:45:30.109 --> 01:45:33.476
We have to convince Ertugrul
to surrender when he comes, brother.

01:45:34.376 --> 01:45:36.442
He and Shahzada, both must surrender.

01:45:37.442 --> 01:45:39.409
I will take them to Sultan myself.

01:45:40.276 --> 01:45:44.176
I will talk to Sultan and convince
him that Ertugrul did not revolt.

01:45:45.976 --> 01:45:48.709
I know there is no other
solution, too, brother.

01:45:49.442 --> 01:45:55.109
Yet, what if Sultan would not be
convinced and kill Ertugrul?

01:45:59.242 --> 01:46:02.142
We know he set off from
Konya with his armies.

01:46:02.376 --> 01:46:03.809
He is obviously angry.

01:46:04.809 --> 01:46:09.176
As I think what one wrong word coming
out of Ertugrul's mouth would cost

01:46:09.276 --> 01:46:11.842
I feel like I will go insane.

01:46:17.942 --> 01:46:18.976
Ertugrul.

01:46:20.742 --> 01:46:22.209
How is Tugtekin Bey?

01:46:22.342 --> 01:46:26.076
Brother, he is not good at all.
My mother is with him.

01:46:30.209 --> 01:46:32.742
Ertugrul. We need to talk.

01:46:39.842 --> 01:46:43.009
We know you took Shahzada
from Seljuq soldiers'.

01:46:45.209 --> 01:46:47.242
Sultan will soon learn about this, too.

01:46:52.376 --> 01:46:57.776
You need to surrender to Sultan's
justice with Shahzada, brother.

01:46:59.409 --> 01:47:03.376
I will do what is necessary, brother.
No one should have a doubt on it.

01:47:03.976 --> 01:47:05.409
What is necessary, Ertugrul?

01:47:05.876 --> 01:47:07.476
I will find Noyan, brother.

01:47:08.409 --> 01:47:11.076
I will prove they are working
together with Kobek.

01:47:14.842 --> 01:47:16.876
If you ask what is necessary, it is this.

01:47:17.776 --> 01:47:20.909
Then I will go to Sultan Aleaddin
and surrender.

01:47:22.209 --> 01:47:24.742
I will bow down to his verdict.

01:47:25.476 --> 01:47:27.909
You still keep saying, Ameer Sadettin.

01:47:28.376 --> 01:47:29.942
Stop being stubborn.

01:47:30.142 --> 01:47:32.776
Brother, see the truth.

01:47:33.342 --> 01:47:36.009
Kobek was the one who put
Noyan and Goncagul on our tail.

01:47:36.076 --> 01:47:37.942
And that woman was the one who
made Bogac a trouble to us

01:47:38.042 --> 01:47:39.942
who led Gokce Hatun to death.

01:47:40.442 --> 01:47:44.342
Do you not see how Kobek has blindfolded
you, how he holds your leash?

01:47:44.409 --> 01:47:45.809
Ertugrul! Sungur!

01:47:48.076 --> 01:47:51.876
You are the one who talks about going to
Byzantium, opposing all the nomad group.

01:47:51.976 --> 01:47:54.242
You are the one who does not hesitate
even a little to divide the nomad group.

01:47:54.342 --> 01:47:56.276
You are the one who deceived
even me with your words.

01:47:56.376 --> 01:47:59.142
Now, with all the troubles on our
plate, you rise against Ameer

01:47:59.209 --> 01:48:01.142
and make everything difficult for us.
I have had enough of you!

01:48:01.242 --> 01:48:02.242
Sungur!

01:48:04.742 --> 01:48:06.242
What are you doing?

01:48:07.009 --> 01:48:08.309
What are you doing?

01:48:09.176 --> 01:48:11.342
Tugtekin is grappling with death inside.

01:48:11.909 --> 01:48:15.276
On the other side Gokce is
laying dead in this young age.

01:48:16.076 --> 01:48:19.276
It is enough. Do you understand? Enough!

01:48:19.909 --> 01:48:22.209
It is not. It is not, mother.

01:48:22.376 --> 01:48:25.309
What Ertugrul does is stubbornness,
pure stubbornness.

01:48:25.809 --> 01:48:29.776
When will you get tired of
digging your own grave, Ertugrul?

01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:32.442
Sultan is coming with his army.
Do you not understand?

01:48:33.076 --> 01:48:35.942
If you continue like this,
he will bludgeon you and us.

01:48:36.076 --> 01:48:37.276
Sungurtekin.

01:48:37.809 --> 01:48:40.942
Are you not aware of what
a fire you are in, Ertugrul?

01:48:41.176 --> 01:48:43.876
Damn it! I am struggling over
for you to live

01:48:44.009 --> 01:48:47.009
for you to make your dreams
come true. Do you not see?

01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:48.842
I do not dream, brother.

01:48:49.242 --> 01:48:50.809
I do what needs to be done.

01:48:51.409 --> 01:48:56.276
I do not rush to save my life when Kobek's
hands are covered in many of ours blood.

01:48:57.309 --> 01:48:59.842
Both Noyan and Kobek
will have what they deserve.

01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:04.264
Tugtekin Bey is dying.

01:49:12.764 --> 01:49:13.797
My brother.

01:49:26.530 --> 01:49:28.464
I will reunite with my love.

01:49:32.464 --> 01:49:34.164
Don't you give up, Ertugrul.

01:49:38.264 --> 01:49:44.497
You should make us expand
beyond the Byzantine border.

01:49:48.264 --> 01:49:49.830
Be under God's watch.

01:49:53.630 --> 01:49:55.097
Give me your blessings.

01:49:56.464 --> 01:49:57.497
I do.

01:50:11.664 --> 01:50:13.997
There is no god but Allah...

01:50:15.697 --> 01:50:18.264
...and Mohammad is
his messenger.

01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:02.864
Gokce.

01:51:25.497 --> 01:51:26.564
Tugtekin.

01:53:40.464 --> 01:53:42.797
See you in heaven, Gokce.

01:54:01.597 --> 01:54:06.597
Dodurga Beys had their eyes on
Tugtekin's seat even before his death.

01:54:07.864 --> 01:54:11.164
I will talk to them tomorrow
at the funeral.

01:54:11.897 --> 01:54:14.697
I will try to stop those

01:54:14.864 --> 01:54:19.797
who shamelessly wanted to take
Tugtekin's place even before he died.

01:54:21.130 --> 01:54:25.997
If I don't do this, they too will be
under Ameer Sadettin's control.

01:54:28.497 --> 01:54:32.164
When Ertugrul goes after
Noyan and Kobek,

01:54:32.564 --> 01:54:34.897
it is our duty to look after
both nomad groups.

01:54:40.697 --> 01:54:41.964
Hayme Hatun.

01:54:42.864 --> 01:54:47.930
I'm very concerned about Gundogdu
and Sungurtekin Beys.

01:54:50.864 --> 01:54:53.730
It is certain they will leave
Ertugrul Bey alone.

01:54:56.197 --> 01:54:59.197
May God be on our side.

01:55:01.664 --> 01:55:02.964
Amen.

01:55:31.897 --> 01:55:34.864
Apparently, there is no place for
Ertugrul among us, brother.

01:55:35.597 --> 01:55:38.830
He has already chosen the path he will
take, and a different destination.

01:55:40.264 --> 01:55:42.630
It was obvious this would
happen someday.

01:55:43.797 --> 01:55:46.264
Our nomad group will be divided.
There is no doubting that.

01:55:47.264 --> 01:55:50.564
However, Ertugrul will not go alone.

01:55:51.264 --> 01:55:53.130
That is what I am worried about.

01:55:54.530 --> 01:55:59.030
Many of our Alps, many people
will follow his lead.

01:56:00.697 --> 01:56:02.930
Then our duty is to prevent that.

01:56:03.564 --> 01:56:05.164
But it is necessary for us

01:56:05.464 --> 01:56:08.030
to solve Ertugrul's
Shahzada problem first.

01:56:09.730 --> 01:56:14.797
We could save him but how
will Ertugrul save himself from his greed?

01:56:42.464 --> 01:56:44.530
We're all set.

01:56:46.064 --> 01:56:47.997
It's time to hit the road.
Let's go.

01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:25.764
I am tired of waiting, brothers.

01:57:26.897 --> 01:57:31.864
True, brother. No one is coming.
I can't wait any longer.

01:57:33.497 --> 01:57:36.530
Look at yourself.
I thought you were more patient.

01:57:39.464 --> 01:57:41.530
This is totally not like you, Bamsi.

01:57:43.630 --> 01:57:45.097
You are right, brothers.

01:57:45.630 --> 01:57:49.197
One can make mistakes
even if he is enlightened.

01:57:49.264 --> 01:57:51.764
One can't tell right from wrong.

01:57:54.164 --> 01:57:55.464
Someone is coming.

01:58:04.164 --> 01:58:05.497
That is Bogac.

01:58:07.264 --> 01:58:08.564
You see, Bamsi?

01:58:13.230 --> 01:58:15.230
Good things await those
who are patient.

01:58:16.664 --> 01:58:19.797
It was worth waiting for, brothers.
That moment has arrived.

01:58:20.264 --> 01:58:22.897
Then why are we here, brothers?
Let's get on with it.

01:58:50.730 --> 01:58:53.864
Do not worry, Halime Sultan.
Yigit is getting better.

01:58:55.997 --> 01:58:59.130
What I fear is what will happen
to Yigit now, Ertugrul.

01:59:00.697 --> 01:59:03.830
Yigit is my brother, Halime.
He means the world to me.

01:59:04.630 --> 01:59:06.264
He can choose my path if he wishes.

01:59:07.764 --> 01:59:10.797
You know he would go to the
end of the earth with you,

01:59:10.930 --> 01:59:12.597
let alone the Byzantine border.

01:59:15.897 --> 01:59:17.930
It is time for an exodus, Halime.

01:59:18.697 --> 01:59:21.197
I'm going to make them pay
for the lives they took.

01:59:21.497 --> 01:59:24.530
If God allows my safe return,
you should know that

01:59:24.897 --> 01:59:27.230
the real battle will begin then.

01:59:30.597 --> 01:59:31.830
If need be...

01:59:32.997 --> 01:59:35.530
...we will take to the road

01:59:35.664 --> 01:59:37.730
with a handful of people who
believe in us, like our prophet did.

01:59:39.097 --> 01:59:43.197
I know that I will part with my
brothers, my loved ones on this path.

01:59:44.097 --> 01:59:45.864
You should be prepared for this, too.

01:59:46.230 --> 01:59:48.930
I am prepared to die for this, Ertugrul.

01:59:49.597 --> 01:59:51.230
I'm ready to do whatever you say.

01:59:53.064 --> 01:59:54.930
Talk to the gallant women
in the nomad group.

01:59:55.230 --> 01:59:57.464
Explain that this is our only choice.

01:59:58.197 --> 02:00:00.697
I will. Do not worry.

02:00:01.164 --> 02:00:03.464
I hope you go there and
come back like the wind, Ertugrul.

02:00:52.964 --> 02:00:54.497
Where have you been, Bogac?

02:00:54.630 --> 02:00:56.530
We miss you at the nomad tent.

02:01:00.764 --> 02:01:01.864
Attack!

02:01:07.264 --> 02:01:08.664
Bamsi.

02:02:07.064 --> 02:02:08.997
It is time to pay, Bogac.

02:02:13.164 --> 02:02:15.030
Ertugrul Bey is waiting for you.

02:03:59.797 --> 02:04:03.764
Al Fathehah, for the
souls of the deceased.

02:04:22.764 --> 02:04:25.664
Gallant and honorable people of
Dodurga,

02:04:26.097 --> 02:04:31.864
don't be sad that you
lost your Bey and his wife.

02:04:32.797 --> 02:04:35.897
He, Tugtekin Bey strived
for his nomad tent

02:04:36.064 --> 02:04:40.130
and his people all his life.

02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:43.997
He risked his own life to
always protect us.

02:04:44.764 --> 02:04:48.964
And we could never forget
how gallant our Bey was.

02:04:50.097 --> 02:04:51.530
You should know that

02:04:51.664 --> 02:04:56.530
those who think Bey's death left us
without a leader are very mistaken.

02:04:57.064 --> 02:05:00.230
Whoever has their eyes on
our Bey's position should know

02:05:00.630 --> 02:05:04.697
that Dodurga tribe has the might
to choose a Bey for themselves

02:05:04.764 --> 02:05:07.497
as they have done
for a thousand years.

02:05:08.264 --> 02:05:12.997
Dodurga tribe will soon have
a Bey worthy of them.

02:05:15.730 --> 02:05:19.464
May God bless the souls of those
who died for this nomad group.

02:05:19.697 --> 02:05:20.930
Amen.

02:06:04.264 --> 02:06:05.964
The hunt is over, Bey.

02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:39.797
You let Tugtekin Bey and Gokce Hatun
die for how many gold coins?

02:06:40.664 --> 02:06:42.630
What did your master promise you?

02:06:59.697 --> 02:07:03.630
How can you do this to your Bey,
who let you in his marquee,

02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:06.230
who trusted you with his life,
who relied on you?

02:07:24.597 --> 02:07:28.030
You will tell us everything that
your master is up to,

02:07:28.197 --> 02:07:30.530
just like you told him about
everything said at the marquee.

02:07:46.264 --> 02:07:47.597
Stop!

02:07:49.064 --> 02:07:50.730
Stop.

02:07:52.530 --> 02:07:53.564
Don't.

02:07:55.464 --> 02:07:56.730
I will tell you everything.

02:08:13.130 --> 02:08:15.264
My condolences, Hayme Hatun.

02:08:16.164 --> 02:08:21.097
Gokce Hatun and Tugtekin Bey's deaths
saddened me beyond measure.

02:08:23.897 --> 02:08:29.530
You've made us well aware of your
presence by attending the funeral.

02:08:31.230 --> 02:08:37.664
You saved that Mongol dog
and he killed Tugtekin Bey and Gokce.

02:08:38.797 --> 02:08:43.030
They would have been alive
if you had killed him.

02:08:47.864 --> 02:08:51.897
His Ameer. Selcan is in great sorrow.

02:08:52.164 --> 02:08:53.464
Excuse her.

02:08:53.697 --> 02:08:55.064
I know about mourning.

02:08:56.597 --> 02:08:57.630
And sorrow, too.

02:08:58.530 --> 02:09:00.564
It's her sorrow talking.

02:09:00.730 --> 02:09:02.530
I understand. It's okay.

02:09:04.264 --> 02:09:07.064
It's painful for me to see
a glorious tribe like Dodurga

02:09:07.164 --> 02:09:10.764
losing a gallant fighter
like Tugtekin Bey.

02:09:11.964 --> 02:09:14.697
While Artuk Bey claims the opposite,

02:09:15.130 --> 02:09:19.630
I am worried about Dodurga being
weakened without a leader.

02:09:20.797 --> 02:09:23.730
I will do all I can, for a gallant Bey

02:09:23.797 --> 02:09:27.264
who will make up for
Tugtekin Bey's absence,

02:09:27.597 --> 02:09:30.630
to be appointed
as soon as possible.

02:09:30.930 --> 02:09:32.564
You can rest assured of that.

02:09:34.564 --> 02:09:36.697
As long as we are alive,

02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:41.897
the Dodurga tribe will never be
weakened, God willing.

02:09:42.764 --> 02:09:44.830
I don't doubt that, Hayme Hatun.

02:09:45.264 --> 02:09:51.030
Yet, my duty is to do
whatever I can to help.

02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:57.997
We wouldn't want our Ameer
to be preoccupied with our troubles.

02:10:00.464 --> 02:10:01.997
Again, my condolences.

02:10:03.664 --> 02:10:08.764
I only have one wish: Ertugrul
to turn himself to the Sultan

02:10:09.930 --> 02:10:13.597
before he causes more
suffering and funerals.

02:10:13.697 --> 02:10:15.164
I pray for that.

02:10:40.630 --> 02:10:41.864
Sungurtekin Bey.

02:10:42.797 --> 02:10:45.197
I managed to suppress the
rebellion with much difficulty.

02:10:45.497 --> 02:10:47.264
I restored order.

02:10:48.797 --> 02:10:52.664
And did this despite your
brother Ertugrul's efforts.

02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:58.897
However, these lands are
always prone to rebellion.

02:11:00.464 --> 02:11:02.697
Beys who ask for forgiveness today,

02:11:03.730 --> 02:11:07.597
could stab us in the back
when they get the chance tomorrow.

02:11:09.064 --> 02:11:12.164
That is why, when all this is over

02:11:12.897 --> 02:11:15.564
in order for you to make
the order everlasting,

02:11:15.764 --> 02:11:18.064
you will be appointed margrave,
Sungurtekin.

02:11:24.897 --> 02:11:28.697
I am ready to do anything to
restore order in these lands.

02:11:31.664 --> 02:11:34.097
But I need to deal with
the Shahzada matter first.

02:11:36.697 --> 02:11:39.064
Alright, Sungurtekin Bey.

02:11:39.864 --> 02:11:44.730
Stop Ertugrul from ruining
his tribe like he ruined himself.

02:13:34.864 --> 02:13:37.730
It is time to meet
the holy spirits, Ulubilge.

02:14:59.730 --> 02:15:03.730
May Ulubilge's soul
reach our Heavenly Father.

02:15:11.697 --> 02:15:16.230
May your Steel Mountain, mightier than
the sun, light up with his soul.

02:15:25.997 --> 02:15:28.797
May your Golden Mountain,
mightier than the moon...

02:15:28.930 --> 02:15:33.230
your Ethel Tree, mightier than the axe
become mightier with his soul.

02:15:46.164 --> 02:15:48.564
Ayaz Khan with moon and sun!

02:15:49.864 --> 02:15:52.530
The sacred trees adorned with cloths!

02:15:55.464 --> 02:15:57.630
Beech tree with the sacred leaves!

02:16:00.730 --> 02:16:03.064
Owner of the flaming fire, Ak Yayik!

02:16:07.164 --> 02:16:09.130
Oh, Heavenly Father!

02:16:12.797 --> 02:16:15.097
Ground waters with a thousand ears!

02:16:18.130 --> 02:16:20.197
Bugra Khan with eyes of cloud!

02:16:24.264 --> 02:16:26.497
Brave man with the feet of ice!

02:16:28.164 --> 02:16:32.230
Bulut! Tay! Bugra!

02:16:38.564 --> 02:16:40.997
Take him to the world of souls!

02:17:10.797 --> 02:17:13.764
May these lands we fought
and travelled on,

02:17:13.897 --> 02:17:17.264
where we killed and died,
become our land of glory!

02:17:18.130 --> 02:17:20.797
We came here for vengeance!

02:17:20.997 --> 02:17:22.530
For vengeance!

02:19:01.097 --> 02:19:02.564
Noyan!

02:19:03.597 --> 02:19:04.797
Ertugrul.

02:19:11.464 --> 02:19:14.197
I'm here to deliver you
to the demons of hell!
