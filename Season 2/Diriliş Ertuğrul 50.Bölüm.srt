00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 50 will start after 12:23 min.

12:23.774 --> 12:27.774
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:43.412 --> 12:44.412
Let go of my hand.

12:47.212 --> 12:48.679
Are you still protecting this woman?

12:49.179 --> 12:51.579
I understand you. You are in grief.

12:52.645 --> 12:53.779
But you should be patient.

12:55.112 --> 12:57.145
We need to find out who did this.

12:57.779 --> 13:01.545
I will be by your side on finding out the
truth, no matter whoever gets hurt.

13:02.212 --> 13:03.445
But you need to be patient.

13:05.445 --> 13:06.579
What are you talking about?

13:07.579 --> 13:09.679
The woman you protect, is a murderer!

13:11.579 --> 13:13.145
I protect nobody, Tugtekin.

13:14.712 --> 13:18.512
But I know that nothing is as it seems.

13:21.179 --> 13:24.445
If you act on your anger,
we will never find out the truth.

13:27.212 --> 13:29.345
-Take this woman already!
-No! She will not leave!

13:29.712 --> 13:32.412
Enough! Enough! Enough!

13:32.579 --> 13:34.312
What do you think you are doing?

13:34.645 --> 13:36.145
Tugtekin, take this away!

13:37.012 --> 13:40.345
What are you doing when my brother's body
is still there?

13:42.145 --> 13:43.145
Take this girl away!

13:46.679 --> 13:48.045
Do not do this, my son!

14:09.145 --> 14:10.179
Mother! Mother! Mother!

14:14.179 --> 14:15.412
Let us take her to the marquee, brother.

14:16.112 --> 14:17.412
Come, Ertugrul. Come.

14:18.579 --> 14:19.579
Come with me.

15:01.612 --> 15:03.612
People heard that Korkut Bey
is dead, brother.

15:05.712 --> 15:08.979
If God permits, we will take this woman
to the caged tent.

15:11.345 --> 15:12.345
Wait here.

15:22.612 --> 15:25.112
Alps, attend to the people.

15:25.979 --> 15:27.012
Yes, Bey.

15:33.212 --> 15:34.445
They will take Banu Cicek out.

15:36.212 --> 15:39.112
Do not worry my brother,
we will shield ourselves.

15:56.379 --> 15:57.545
Kill her!

15:59.079 --> 16:00.279
Catch her!

16:10.079 --> 16:11.645
Kill her! Murderer!

16:23.445 --> 16:24.545
We want justice!

16:27.379 --> 16:28.479
We want justice!

16:30.079 --> 16:32.479
We want justice!
We want the killer of our Bey!

16:35.145 --> 16:36.379
We want her to die!

16:43.745 --> 16:45.045
We want her to die!

16:52.779 --> 16:54.079
We want her to die!

16:55.112 --> 16:56.345
Kill her!

16:56.745 --> 16:58.212
We want her head!

17:01.312 --> 17:02.579
We want her dead!

17:03.012 --> 17:04.279
We want her head!

17:14.179 --> 17:15.279
We want her head!

17:26.579 --> 17:27.579
Father.

17:43.679 --> 17:48.412
Bey, let me prepare your father's body
for the funeral.

17:55.412 --> 17:59.279
Your steadiness at the funeral,
will prevent peoples' anger.

18:04.545 --> 18:06.612
Come, Bey. Come.

18:08.412 --> 18:11.712
Son, until the woman
who did this to your father...

18:13.079 --> 18:14.779
...chokes on her own blood...

18:17.412 --> 18:18.979
...you can not stop.

18:22.012 --> 18:26.345
Tugtekin Bey, after the funeral, you first
duty should be setting the court.

18:28.779 --> 18:32.279
Today. Let justice be upon us quickly.

18:37.979 --> 18:39.479
-Let us go, Bey.
-Come, Bey.

18:41.412 --> 18:42.412
Come.

18:58.579 --> 19:00.212
I failed, brother.

19:02.179 --> 19:04.512
I could not kill that woman.

19:08.379 --> 19:10.045
Our victory day has finally arrived,
Aytolun.

19:11.545 --> 19:13.112
First you should get back on your feet.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.745
Excuse us, Bey. We will take
Aytolun Hatun out of here as well.

19:24.179 --> 19:25.979
Heal my sister, Artuk Bey.

19:27.079 --> 19:31.412
Like you healed my leg which was
about to get cut, you heal her as well.

19:32.679 --> 19:33.745
Hopefully, Bey.

19:50.479 --> 19:52.079
Do not leave this matter
to the court, Bey.

19:52.979 --> 19:55.379
Take my life now.
Take it and end my suffering.

19:58.112 --> 19:59.612
I will bite the dust anyway.

20:01.545 --> 20:03.079
At least you should not be harmed.

20:04.045 --> 20:05.179
Be at ease, woman.

20:06.045 --> 20:08.179
You can never know who is going
to get the sword of justice.

20:09.179 --> 20:10.179
Be patient.

20:21.212 --> 20:22.245
Look at you.

20:28.112 --> 20:29.179
It is all my fault.

20:30.512 --> 20:31.579
Please do not say that.

20:32.979 --> 20:35.545
Cicek Hatun, we already know the score.

20:38.545 --> 20:40.345
I will not let you be the prey
on those jackals' table.

20:49.312 --> 20:50.312
Go away!

21:06.379 --> 21:07.512
What is going on, Dogan Alp?

21:09.179 --> 21:10.479
Are you workholding
with this murderer?

21:12.579 --> 21:15.779
When the truth is revealed,
you will be sorry for your words, Bogac.

21:17.279 --> 21:18.712
Let us pray for you to not be the one who
will feel sorry.

21:22.045 --> 21:23.312
One who goes after this woman...

21:24.212 --> 21:26.479
...will be known as a murderer too.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.412
Dogan Alp!

21:58.045 --> 21:59.045
Dogan!

22:02.545 --> 22:04.012
I am fine, Bey. Do not worry about me.

22:05.445 --> 22:06.445
Turgut.

22:07.645 --> 22:08.712
Take care of Dogan.

22:09.379 --> 22:10.745
-As you wish, Bey.
-As you wish, Bey.

22:11.645 --> 22:12.645
Come on, brother.

22:20.979 --> 22:23.212
Do you believe that this girl
is innocent, brother?

22:24.445 --> 22:26.079
I am after the truth, brother.

22:27.379 --> 22:29.679
The way I see it, you are after the
truth as well.

22:31.012 --> 22:34.079
Otherwise, would you ask for
Selcan Hatun and Goncagul Hatun...

22:34.279 --> 22:35.579
...to be questioned?

22:57.661 --> 22:59.161
We are in great pain, Mother.

22:59.928 --> 23:01.628
We will harden our heart.

23:03.061 --> 23:07.561
But, until we find the one who killed
my uncle, there will be no mourning.

23:28.928 --> 23:32.095
My brother's dead body at one side...

23:33.995 --> 23:35.828
...Selcan's words...

23:37.028 --> 23:39.828
...and the seal they left
on my nomad tent at another...

23:41.028 --> 23:43.795
How could we overcome all these disasters?

23:45.195 --> 23:47.095
This wounds all of our hearts, Mother.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.928
But we cannot be beaten down
by our pain or our anger.

23:54.195 --> 23:56.695
First of all, we should lay my uncle
to his final rest.

24:05.561 --> 24:09.261
Artuk Bey wants to see Ertugrul Bey,
Mother Hayme.

24:10.128 --> 24:11.495
Let him in, Rahman.

24:25.128 --> 24:26.728
I have to talk to you, Bey.

24:27.561 --> 24:28.695
Go ahead, Artuk Bey.

24:30.261 --> 24:33.995
My mother knows everything.
She can hear what you have to say.

24:41.561 --> 24:45.195
In all these ruckus, I could not even
express my condolences to you.

24:45.661 --> 24:48.261
Thank you Artuk Bey, bless your heart.

24:51.661 --> 24:53.028
Go ahead Artuk Bey, we are listening.

25:02.095 --> 25:04.961
I heard Gumustekin Bey and
Tugtekin Bey talking about this.

25:05.895 --> 25:09.195
They want to set the court
immediately after the burial.

25:14.628 --> 25:17.561
Gumustekin wants to kill and get rid of
Banu Cicek as soon as possible.

25:17.995 --> 25:22.561
That way, he wants to close both the seal
and the murder matter for good.

25:23.028 --> 25:24.261
We can not let that happen.

25:25.161 --> 25:28.795
If he is determined to do this,
how do you plan to stop him, Ertugrul?

25:29.628 --> 25:32.128
After the burial, we will talk to Tugtekin

25:32.528 --> 25:34.895
and convince him to do the Bey ceremony
as soon as possible.

25:40.495 --> 25:44.495
What if the court will be set tomorrow?
What is going to change, son?

25:45.061 --> 25:49.595
There is a long night ahead of us and
it is enough for us to save Banu Cicek.

26:07.561 --> 26:09.128
I'm in great pain.

26:11.061 --> 26:14.495
But all I know is that I believe in you.

26:17.128 --> 26:18.795
Do not let me down.

26:23.295 --> 26:24.961
Excuse me, Artuk Bey.

26:40.061 --> 26:42.561
You are the bravest woman I know, Aytolun.

26:45.061 --> 26:47.728
You did not abstain from
sacrificing yourself.

26:48.828 --> 26:52.128
Thanks to my aunt, the things
we wished for, became reality, father.

26:52.928 --> 26:56.095
As long as Banu Cicek lives

26:57.195 --> 27:00.561
our goals will be our graves.

27:02.995 --> 27:04.261
Do not worry, Aytolun.

27:05.261 --> 27:07.895
Everything will come to an end
in the court I set today.

27:09.195 --> 27:12.795
Selcan will dig her own grave
with her accusations.

27:13.695 --> 27:15.495
And Ertugrul...

27:17.995 --> 27:20.861
As soon as I get the Bey sword myself

27:21.728 --> 27:25.795
taking care of Ertugrul
will be Tugtekin's job.

27:31.561 --> 27:33.761
There is something I wish
to ask you, Artuk Bey.

27:35.561 --> 27:39.228
That old woman who Selcan Hatun
has been talking about. Who is she?

27:39.861 --> 27:44.295
Before I came to this place as a medic,
she was healer of nomad tent.

27:46.695 --> 27:50.628
After Korkut Bey gave me the medic duty,
she kept herself in silence.

27:52.095 --> 27:53.261
Healer, you say?

27:55.061 --> 27:56.961
Then she would know
how to made a poison, too.

27:57.595 --> 27:58.761
Yes, she does Bey.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.995
They were poisoned by the same vile
yet while my uncle dies

28:03.128 --> 28:06.128
Aytolun Hatun lives.
It sickens me Artuk Bey.

28:07.228 --> 28:11.895
Selcan Hatun says that, when the old woman
came in here, Aytolun dismissed her.

28:12.061 --> 28:16.595
Obviously, there is an ominous secret
between Aytolun and this old woman.

28:17.895 --> 28:19.295
Whatever this secret is

28:19.895 --> 28:22.961
it kept her alive, while killing
my aunt and my uncle.

28:26.795 --> 28:29.928
I will not let them take their secrets
to their graves.

28:30.861 --> 28:34.028
I will not put forth Banu Cicek
to their make believe court.

28:48.028 --> 28:49.128
They will kill her.

28:52.228 --> 28:54.161
I can not let them do this to Banu Cicek.

28:55.128 --> 28:56.128
Dogan.

28:56.828 --> 29:00.095
Stop, brother. Keep your anger in check.

29:00.261 --> 29:03.661
This is not the way to do this.
Our Bey will surely find a solution.

29:03.761 --> 29:06.261
No, brother, we should save
our sister Banu Cicek.

29:06.628 --> 29:09.828
Bamsi, stop this. Do not feed the fire.

29:10.561 --> 29:11.628
Permission!

29:17.895 --> 29:19.261
I have a few questions for you, Dogan.

29:20.061 --> 29:21.995
Are you ready to give up
everything you have?

29:22.061 --> 29:23.961
-Yes, I am Bey.
-To be exiled?

29:25.128 --> 29:27.128
-Yes, Bey.
-To die?

29:27.761 --> 29:28.961
Always, Bey.

29:35.628 --> 29:37.161
You will Banu Cicek escape tonight.

29:41.495 --> 29:42.795
Now listen to me carefully.

29:43.495 --> 29:47.128
You will take a medicated sherbet
made by Artuk Bey to Banu Cicek.

29:48.195 --> 29:49.895
Alps will not probably let you in.

29:50.528 --> 29:52.995
Give the sherbet to the guards
and make them fall asleep.

29:54.061 --> 29:55.695
There should not be any bloodshed.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.761
In this cold weather, nobody will say no
to that hot sherbet, Bey.

30:00.761 --> 30:04.028
Fasten the horses that you will use
to escape with Banu Cicek.

30:04.228 --> 30:07.895
After you escaped, nobody
should be able to blame

30:08.028 --> 30:10.095
Turgut or Bamsi for this,
do you understand that?

30:10.861 --> 30:13.595
-Understood, Bey.
-What are we going to do, Bey?

30:15.095 --> 30:20.028
You will watch over Dogan. Make sure
that nobody follows you or sees you.

30:21.128 --> 30:23.095
-As you wish, Bey.
-As you wish, Bey.

30:24.028 --> 30:29.295
After the escape, you need to go to
Kurtbogazi and wait for my message.

30:29.761 --> 30:31.595
-Understood?
-Understood, Bey.

30:32.895 --> 30:35.295
If you are ready, we should leave.
We have a funeral.

33:57.228 --> 33:58.628
-Good luck with that.
-Thank you.

34:26.195 --> 34:27.495
What is wrong Turali?

34:29.528 --> 34:30.995
Did you miss Father Demir?

34:31.561 --> 34:33.761
Is it possible not to Bey?
Did you not miss him?

34:39.028 --> 34:40.128
Come here.

34:45.661 --> 34:46.961
I too, miss him.

34:48.095 --> 34:50.028
I miss him as much as you do.

34:51.061 --> 34:54.795
But last night Father Demir came to me
and talked to me.

34:57.528 --> 34:58.795
Where did he come?

34:59.261 --> 35:00.961
I saw him in my dreams, Bey.

35:03.861 --> 35:04.961
So?

35:06.828 --> 35:08.161
What did Father Demir say to you?

35:08.595 --> 35:10.795
He said that someone made a weapon for me.

35:11.228 --> 35:14.261
And I will go to war with it right
beside Ertugrul Bey.

35:14.895 --> 35:17.061
Ertugrul Bey will make me an Alp.

35:17.828 --> 35:19.961
And he said that I will be a great Alp.

35:22.895 --> 35:24.195
Come here then.

35:26.028 --> 35:27.495
If God permits, Turali.

35:34.795 --> 35:36.128
If God permits, my boy.

35:37.528 --> 35:38.761
If God permits.

35:47.228 --> 35:53.228
Pig's tripe has bursted, all of its dirt
and disgraces revealed, Halime.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.528
That's what I'm afraid of Selcan.

35:57.895 --> 35:59.795
From now on, all of their worries
will be Ertugrul.

36:11.561 --> 36:13.728
Did you get what you wished for,
Selcan Hatun?

36:13.928 --> 36:18.295
Yes, I did. After everything has revealed
in the court, I will get more.

36:18.761 --> 36:22.195
And you will not be able to find even
a single little hole to take cover in.

36:25.928 --> 36:28.795
I do not know, who still stands
not affected by your accusations.

36:31.928 --> 36:35.561
But when this is all over
you will lose, Selcan Hatun.

36:37.895 --> 36:40.061
Do you know why I am happy Goncagul?

36:40.695 --> 36:43.595
You can not act on the sly no more.

36:44.061 --> 36:47.661
Your only weapon is living like a bug
in nooks and crannies

36:47.795 --> 36:51.795
and distress the ones that
you are able to get a grip on.

36:52.595 --> 36:54.828
But you will not be able to do
that anymore.

36:55.928 --> 37:01.028
I whirled your own evil around you,
let us see if you can escape from that.

37:03.595 --> 37:05.995
Let us see how you will be
able to deal with

37:06.095 --> 37:08.128
all those sins that you commit
in the past.

37:10.195 --> 37:13.261
You are the most cruel woman
that I know Selcan Hatun.

37:13.961 --> 37:16.495
You even have your own sibling's blood
on your hands.

37:17.195 --> 37:19.628
Selcan. Please do not do that.

37:20.995 --> 37:23.028
How do you know all these things?

37:23.228 --> 37:27.595
I know. I know that you ambushed
Ertugrul Bey with Kurtoglu

37:27.761 --> 37:29.961
and I know that you persuaded Gokce, too.

37:30.495 --> 37:34.261
Who would believe a woman like you?
Let us see what will you do

37:34.495 --> 37:37.795
when the people of two nomad groups
knows what a shrew you are!

37:47.561 --> 37:48.861
Selcan, are you alright?

37:53.295 --> 37:55.061
Selcan.

38:05.928 --> 38:07.961
Heaven only knows why.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.261
What happened Selcan?
What is wrong with you?

38:17.728 --> 38:19.595
I think I am pregnant, Halime.

38:21.028 --> 38:22.295
Pregnant?

38:39.228 --> 38:40.261
Aunt.

38:44.495 --> 38:45.695
Mother.

38:48.528 --> 38:49.761
I am fine.

38:51.261 --> 38:53.495
I wanted to be your side.

39:11.195 --> 39:13.128
Mother Hayme and
Ertugrul Bey arrived, Bey.

39:13.628 --> 39:14.728
Let them in.

39:34.061 --> 39:37.995
When I looked at you
I saw my brother's eyes.

39:40.495 --> 39:41.895
My father is gone, aunt.

39:44.795 --> 39:48.561
He will be always in you with his courage
and his sense of justice.

39:49.261 --> 39:50.561
I hope so.

39:53.795 --> 39:54.928
Go ahead.

39:57.261 --> 39:59.261
-My condolences, brother.
-Thank you.

40:04.161 --> 40:05.895
Let us be seated.

40:15.561 --> 40:19.895
Son, do not leave your people leaderless
for even one night.

40:22.095 --> 40:25.095
The murderer who killed our Bey

40:26.161 --> 40:29.028
will pay for her crime Hayme Hatun.

40:30.128 --> 40:34.095
The punishment should be decided
by the newly selected Bey.

40:36.261 --> 40:38.028
That's the proper way for a Bey.

40:39.861 --> 40:42.895
My father is also a Bey in
our nomad tent, Mother Hayme.

40:43.895 --> 40:45.761
But he is not the Bey of the nomad tent.

40:48.995 --> 40:52.561
This is not matter of state, this is
an internal matter of the nomad tent.

40:53.095 --> 40:54.995
And the Bey is entitled to judge
his people.

40:55.695 --> 40:58.295
With his sense of justice
and with his graces.

40:59.661 --> 41:04.561
He should show that he is handling even
the death of his father justly with grace.

41:06.128 --> 41:10.161
Hayme Hatun, you are wrong.

41:10.961 --> 41:12.028
Mother.

41:14.828 --> 41:17.195
Mother Hayme and
my brother Ertugrul are right.

41:20.795 --> 41:22.828
My people expect justice from me.

41:25.228 --> 41:27.861
I was so focused on my anger and pain,
I forgot my people.

41:29.295 --> 41:31.995
Leaving the nomad group even
for one night without a leader

41:32.261 --> 41:36.228
is not proper by our morals
and my father's marquee.

41:40.495 --> 41:41.895
Thank you. I appreciate it.

41:51.128 --> 41:52.628
Excuse me.

42:26.895 --> 42:28.028
What is it, my daughter?

42:28.095 --> 42:31.761
Mother Hayme and Ertugrul Bey
came to the marquee, father.

42:31.961 --> 42:35.161
They persuaded Tugtekin
to hold the Bey ceremoni soon.

42:37.661 --> 42:41.195
He wants to be elected as Bey
and rule the court himself.

42:43.128 --> 42:46.495
Then he will question
both Selcan Hatun and me.

42:49.061 --> 42:52.695
I do not know what can come out of this.
I am afraid, father.

42:53.761 --> 42:56.095
Do not be afraid, daughter.

42:56.495 --> 42:58.561
Then we will take precautions.

42:59.128 --> 43:00.528
How, father?

43:01.695 --> 43:03.828
Tugtekin already made up his mind.

43:03.961 --> 43:05.995
He might already have sent
the news to everyone.

43:07.661 --> 43:13.061
So now it is time for Tugtekin to learn
Selcan Hatun's accusations.

43:13.228 --> 43:17.295
Tell your aunt that she should
put a bug in Tugtekin's ear tonight.

43:18.961 --> 43:22.828
As for you, I will send Gundogdu to you.

43:24.228 --> 43:27.095
Tell him what kind of a woman his wife is.

43:29.261 --> 43:32.528
If Ertugrul wanted to left the court
for tomorrow

43:33.761 --> 43:36.195
surely he has something else in his mind.

43:38.028 --> 43:42.295
I need to know what he and
his Alps are doing at all times.

43:43.261 --> 43:44.795
<i>Permission, Gumustekin Bey?</i>

43:44.961 --> 43:46.295
Come in, Gundogdu Bey.

43:49.661 --> 43:50.861
Excuse me, Bey.

43:56.295 --> 43:59.528
-I was thinking of you.
-What is the matter, Bey?

44:00.061 --> 44:01.795
Hayme Hatun and Ertugrul.

44:02.661 --> 44:07.861
Persuaded Tugtekin to hold the ceremony
and set the court for tomorrow.

44:09.195 --> 44:13.895
It seems the justice will be served
by our new Bey tomorrow.

44:16.061 --> 44:19.728
I hope that your brother Ertugrul
is not pursuing any other goals.

44:22.761 --> 44:24.661
Why did you want to see me?

44:25.495 --> 44:30.495
Bey, I need to talk to you about something
for the sake of the court.

44:30.628 --> 44:34.228
Court is in our new Bey's hands now,
Gundogdu Bey.

44:38.728 --> 44:42.028
Okay, then I will take my leave.

44:54.961 --> 44:56.061
Ertugrul.

45:03.161 --> 45:06.761
I heard that you persuaded my mother
to postpone the court date. Why?

45:08.728 --> 45:10.795
Are we not looking for justice, brother?

45:12.928 --> 45:16.861
This is not a matter of state, brother.
This is a matter of the nomad tent.

45:17.495 --> 45:20.661
And the Bey should be the one that
secures the justice. Am I right?

45:21.895 --> 45:24.061
Try not to do something wrong, brother.

45:24.661 --> 45:27.995
In all these wrongs, finding the truth
will be Tugtekin's duty brother.

45:28.128 --> 45:31.928
Certainly, it will be his duty.
However you should know

45:32.061 --> 45:35.295
as the leader of the Alps,
I will know everything you do.

45:41.761 --> 45:43.761
You made my brother furious, Ertugrul.

45:44.961 --> 45:47.228
He is always like this.
I did what needs to be done.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.661
And I will continue to push him
until he sees the truth.

46:09.295 --> 46:11.728
<i>-Permission, Bey?</i>
-Come in.

46:18.961 --> 46:20.261
You asked for me, Bey.

46:21.961 --> 46:23.261
Bogac Alp.

46:25.061 --> 46:27.495
I know your loyalty to Tugtekin Bey.

46:28.728 --> 46:29.961
He is suffering much.

46:30.995 --> 46:34.695
It is time for us to support him
in his dark days.

46:35.495 --> 46:36.861
I will give my life for Bey.

46:41.095 --> 46:43.961
I think that Ertugrul is doing
something wrong.

46:44.995 --> 46:50.161
Assign the Alps that you trust
to keep an eye on Ertugrul's Alps.

46:50.861 --> 46:54.128
If you have even the slightest doubt,
come here and let me know.

46:57.928 --> 46:59.228
As you wish, Bey.

47:12.695 --> 47:16.161
-We want to talk to you about something.
-What is it, son?

47:22.595 --> 47:26.295
In this dark day, it is hard
to talk about this, I know.

47:28.028 --> 47:29.195
But...

47:31.128 --> 47:32.761
Migration time has come, Mother.

47:37.228 --> 47:38.828
Where did that come from?

47:40.895 --> 47:43.728
Mother, as you very well know,
my deceased uncle was

47:43.895 --> 47:47.595
the one who kept two nomad groups
together. And now he is gone.

47:48.061 --> 47:50.661
It is possible that Tugtekin
will be elected as Bey.

47:51.128 --> 47:54.861
And sooner or later, he will learn
what Selcan said.

47:55.495 --> 47:59.561
Also, you can guess what will happen when
Dogan lets Banu Cicek escape tonight.

48:01.961 --> 48:04.295
Even if we prove that
Gumustekin stole the seal

48:04.961 --> 48:07.628
and the one who killed my uncle
gets punishment

48:08.661 --> 48:10.495
I finally understood one thing, Mother

48:11.695 --> 48:15.228
the soil that our almighty tree will
take root, is not here.

48:15.895 --> 48:17.195
I know that in my heart.

48:19.628 --> 48:22.895
Our constrained stay in our
Dodurgali siblings lands is over.

48:23.661 --> 48:27.195
Spring is coming, mother.
There is no time to loose.

48:30.861 --> 48:34.661
After the things that happened,
I agree with you two.

48:36.761 --> 48:38.528
But where can we go, son?

48:40.995 --> 48:43.661
Places that we will be able to prosper

48:44.228 --> 48:48.095
become stronger and stand tall
with the will of God.

48:49.661 --> 48:51.495
Where is that place, son?

48:55.795 --> 48:57.128
We will go to west, mother.

48:58.295 --> 49:00.061
To the Byzantine border of our state.

49:02.728 --> 49:06.795
Well, what does your brother Gundogdu
says about this?

49:27.895 --> 49:30.628
Let us pray Al-Fatiha for
our deceased Korkut Bey.

49:52.961 --> 49:54.995
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

49:56.028 --> 49:59.228
In the 99 names of God,
who at will creates

49:59.561 --> 50:02.595
and fills the hearts of his creations
with belief.

50:07.628 --> 50:09.261
Dear Beys of Dodurga.

50:10.595 --> 50:12.561
You honored our seignory headquarter.

50:13.128 --> 50:18.128
In your presence, I ask God
to bestow his graces upon our Bey.

50:20.628 --> 50:22.761
May God reward him with his heaven.

50:22.861 --> 50:24.195
Amen.

50:25.561 --> 50:27.228
Amen.

51:25.595 --> 51:26.728
Dogan.

51:27.228 --> 51:30.928
Turgut brother, what are you doing here?
Did you forget what Bey said?

51:31.595 --> 51:33.095
I alone should take the horses
that we escape with.

51:33.228 --> 51:36.028
We are being followed Dogan.
Do not let them know.

51:38.295 --> 51:40.195
You can not take the horses anymore.

51:40.995 --> 51:42.295
Who will take them then?

51:43.261 --> 51:44.561
Abdurrahman.

51:45.861 --> 51:47.961
It seems that Gumustekin
sent his men to follow us.

52:07.795 --> 52:10.595
What am I going to do tonight?
How can I lose them?

52:10.728 --> 52:12.928
Even if I did, they will get
more suspicious, right?

52:13.761 --> 52:15.895
-How can I let Banu Cicek escape now?
-Stop.

52:17.161 --> 52:18.595
I am thinking.

52:26.895 --> 52:28.895
Bamsi and me will quarrel tonight.

52:29.695 --> 52:31.828
And you will seize this opportunity
to flee from the tent.

52:32.661 --> 52:35.661
But they need to think
that you are in the tent.

52:37.761 --> 52:39.561
After that, it's up to you, brother.

52:40.628 --> 52:44.061
-I will run right after what?
-Come on. I will tell you later.

52:44.161 --> 52:46.895
Untie the horse, go to Abdurrahman
and tell him the situation.

52:47.295 --> 52:50.061
He will take the horses. And I will
take the saddles to the tent.

52:52.228 --> 52:54.028
-Alright, brother.
-Alright.

53:24.195 --> 53:28.261
Getting assigned is always desirable,
Gumustekin Bey.

53:29.195 --> 53:34.861
I know that the ones who wish to be Bey
are feeling ashamed of saying so.

53:35.961 --> 53:38.628
As you have the honour
of holding the cerenomy

53:39.228 --> 53:42.128
we would like to know
what you have in your heart.

53:44.761 --> 53:46.061
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

53:49.795 --> 53:53.861
I believe, the one who is
worthy of this rank

53:54.295 --> 53:56.995
is the one who served for our community

53:57.195 --> 54:02.128
and Korkut Bey's brave son, Tugtekin Bey.

54:06.895 --> 54:10.161
As you desire in your heart, Artuk Bey.

54:13.561 --> 54:16.095
Thank you, Gumustekin Bey.

54:17.728 --> 54:22.995
Hearing those words from a worthy man
such as yourself, made me glad.

54:25.595 --> 54:29.095
I also nominate Tugtekin Bey as our Bey.

54:43.061 --> 54:45.161
We respect Tugtekin Bey dearly.

54:45.495 --> 54:49.495
However, we all know that
he could not become successful

54:49.728 --> 54:52.261
as the leader of the Alps.

54:52.895 --> 54:58.861
I also wonder how will he do
as the Bey of Dodurga.

55:04.028 --> 55:08.295
To tell the truth, I think with
his experience and knowledge

55:08.728 --> 55:13.295
the one who fits this rank perfectly
is Gumustekin Bey.

55:47.961 --> 55:49.228
You asked for me, mother?

55:50.195 --> 55:51.861
Come son, sit down.

56:00.628 --> 56:04.695
We do not even have time to mourn
for my brother. But...

56:05.995 --> 56:09.295
...there is something that I need
to know what do you think about.

56:09.961 --> 56:11.295
Yes, Mother. What is it?

56:13.695 --> 56:17.528
Two tents can no longer
walk in the same road, son.

56:19.295 --> 56:20.761
This is how I see it.

56:22.028 --> 56:23.695
How can you say that, mother?

56:25.961 --> 56:27.961
Don't you know that Noyan will come back?

56:28.261 --> 56:30.295
Are you not aware of that
the peace is temporary?

56:30.761 --> 56:32.895
We need this unity.

56:33.728 --> 56:35.895
Remember what they did to us
while we were migrating.

56:36.028 --> 56:38.795
Remember all our pain,
all those martyrs, mother.

56:40.761 --> 56:44.228
We neither have a place to go
nor have a place to stay.

56:46.128 --> 56:49.495
I think we should stay united.
This is my opinion.

56:50.295 --> 56:53.695
What is going to happen when Tugtekin
hears everything tomorrow in the court?

56:55.228 --> 56:58.861
If this unity will brake with
some accusations, then so be it.

57:01.061 --> 57:04.628
But, if God permits, tomorrow
the court will decide justly

57:04.761 --> 57:07.695
and this unity will continue.

57:08.761 --> 57:12.195
At least until we can get back
on to our feet.

57:12.895 --> 57:17.761
This unity needs to stand,
until we get rid of Noyan, mother.

57:19.861 --> 57:21.761
Did Ertugrul said something
to you, mother?

57:24.261 --> 57:29.528
Look, mother. You should not follow
Ertugrul's whims.

57:30.995 --> 57:34.161
You should not drag all these people
to follow him with you.

57:43.761 --> 57:45.161
Mother, think this over.

57:46.095 --> 57:48.695
If you insist on doing this,

57:48.928 --> 57:52.995
I swear to God I am not with you on this.
You should know that.

58:27.661 --> 58:32.595
That you deem me worthy of the Bey rank
made me feel quite fortunate.

58:34.495 --> 58:35.661
Thank you all.

58:36.595 --> 58:41.228
However, this rank suits Tugtekin Bey.

58:45.061 --> 58:48.661
As a son of Oguz, Tugtekin Bey

58:49.261 --> 58:52.861
has all the virtues to be our Bey.

58:52.928 --> 58:53.995
Thank you.

58:59.228 --> 59:01.595
Gumustekin Bey, we trust your words.

59:02.028 --> 59:04.128
However, how can you be so sure that

59:04.228 --> 59:07.061
Tugtekin Bey will be able to overcome
the responsibilities of this duty?

59:16.161 --> 59:19.695
While fighting against the
Mongol heathens,

59:19.761 --> 59:22.495
Tugtekin Bey came back from the dead

59:22.561 --> 59:26.495
and revealed his ability to be our Bey.

59:28.028 --> 59:31.195
The bravery and the sense of justice
of Korkut Bey

59:32.128 --> 59:34.661
is manifested through Tugtekin Bey.

59:35.795 --> 59:38.728
And he proved this again and again
in all the wars that he fought!

59:39.028 --> 59:40.195
Thank you.

59:52.828 --> 59:55.761
In that case, let the decision be made
by Dodurga Beys.

00:59:56.961 --> 01:00:01.495
Anyone who wants Tugtekin Bey to be
the Bey of Dodurga, raise your hands.

01:00:38.161 --> 01:00:43.295
Tugtekin Bey is the new Bey of Dodurga!

01:00:45.895 --> 01:00:49.161
Hope this will bring good fortune
and prosperity to our community.

01:00:49.661 --> 01:00:51.895
Amen.

01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:02.261
Tugtekin Bey...

01:01:03.995 --> 01:01:06.628
...may your rule bring peace
to our nomad tent.

01:01:10.895 --> 01:01:12.261
If God permits...

01:01:13.095 --> 01:01:17.195
...like the deceased Korkut Bey,
you will be a just Bey

01:01:17.495 --> 01:01:20.161
who take care of his nomad tent,
his kin and his bloodline, Bey.

01:01:20.861 --> 01:01:22.061
If God permits, Artuk Bey.

01:01:24.695 --> 01:01:25.828
Beys...

01:01:27.295 --> 01:01:30.195
...I appreciate that you all see me
worthy of this position.

01:01:30.261 --> 01:01:31.261
Alright.

01:01:31.561 --> 01:01:34.261
I would like you all to know,
I will carry this flag

01:01:34.495 --> 01:01:36.828
that I took over from my father,
with great honour.

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:41.895
-May God help us.
-Amen.

01:02:26.261 --> 01:02:28.128
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:02:35.195 --> 01:02:36.995
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:02:56.952 --> 01:02:57.952
<i>Permission!</i>

01:03:04.952 --> 01:03:05.952
Are you ready?

01:03:06.519 --> 01:03:07.519
We are ready, Bey.

01:03:08.019 --> 01:03:11.319
However, Gumustekin put his Alps on our
tail. They are watching our every move.

01:03:11.719 --> 01:03:13.085
Abdurrahman took the horses, Bey.

01:03:13.819 --> 01:03:16.952
We will elude them at night and
do the necessary. Do not worry.

01:03:17.152 --> 01:03:18.152
Thank you.

01:03:18.819 --> 01:03:20.919
I trust you. Be on alert.

01:03:22.285 --> 01:03:27.119
When they will learn about this, first,
Tugtekin will sic his Alps on us as.

01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:29.319
Do not dissent.

01:03:31.485 --> 01:03:35.852
What I want from you is to bow to them
when Tugtekin's Alps come.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:43.019
Is it clear, Bamsi?

01:03:44.319 --> 01:03:45.419
It is clear, Bey.

01:03:47.419 --> 01:03:48.719
Give your blessings, Bey.

01:03:50.852 --> 01:03:52.119
I give you my blessings, Dogan brother.

01:03:58.085 --> 01:03:59.285
May God be our helper.

01:04:40.052 --> 01:04:45.452
Your virtue as Bey will bring welfare
and safety to Dodurga Tent.

01:04:45.885 --> 01:04:46.885
Thank you.

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:51.519
Your experiences will
guide me, Gumustekin Bey.

01:04:53.519 --> 01:04:55.118
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:04:55.285 --> 01:04:56.852
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:04:57.085 --> 01:04:58.419
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:04:58.919 --> 01:05:00.319
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:05:00.819 --> 01:05:02.219
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:05:02.485 --> 01:05:04.052
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:05:04.285 --> 01:05:05.852
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:05:06.085 --> 01:05:07.152
God bless you!

01:05:08.285 --> 01:05:09.452
Brave men of Dodurga!

01:05:10.452 --> 01:05:15.152
We survived many battles, many suffers.

01:05:17.319 --> 01:05:19.252
Because of our deceased Korkut Bey

01:05:20.219 --> 01:05:24.785
we walked over every obstacle in our way.

01:05:25.485 --> 01:05:32.352
The blood flowing from our weapons
swept like a holy river.

01:05:33.785 --> 01:05:35.385
This is how we will do it after this.

01:05:36.719 --> 01:05:39.519
I will revenge my deceased Korkut Bey.

01:05:41.252 --> 01:05:44.252
Now, the time for Dodurga

01:05:45.185 --> 01:05:49.085
is to get rid of traitors inside of us
and to rear up!

01:05:49.785 --> 01:05:52.485
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:05:53.185 --> 01:05:56.152
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:59.419
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:05:59.885 --> 01:06:03.019
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!
God bless you, Tugtekin Bey!

01:06:06.785 --> 01:06:07.785
Tugtekin Bey.

01:06:56.052 --> 01:07:01.152
The inspirations regularly coming to
our Prophet was interrupted for a time.

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:07.719
At that times, Hazrat Gabriel
was not seen to himself.

01:07:08.152 --> 01:07:11.152
Thereupon, some of the polytheists
mocked with him like

01:07:11.419 --> 01:07:14.985
his God forsaken Mohammed
his God left him.

01:07:16.019 --> 01:07:19.152
Our Master of Prophet who was facing
brutal responses of polytheists

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:23.385
since the day he invited people
from the religion of God

01:07:24.252 --> 01:07:27.052
was the object of their mocking this time.

01:07:27.819 --> 01:07:30.819
This matter was upsetting him a lot.

01:07:31.752 --> 01:07:34.219
His biggest helper was his God
beyond any doubt.

01:07:36.019 --> 01:07:38.919
The inspirations coming from God
was giving him strength and power.

01:07:39.485 --> 01:07:42.519
It was showing him how to act
in his way of invite.

01:07:44.119 --> 01:07:48.519
With the interruption of inspirations,
our Prophet was devoted of his God

01:07:48.885 --> 01:07:51.752
his only abutment and
his only consolation.

01:07:52.319 --> 01:07:55.752
At that very trouble time of our Prohpet

01:07:57.452 --> 01:07:59.219
Duha Surah was told.

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:02.252
His God told his Prophet that:

01:08:03.952 --> 01:08:08.352
"By the forenoon and by the night
when it is still.

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:11.085
Your Maker has neither forsaken you
nor hated you.

01:08:11.719 --> 01:08:14.185
And indeed the hereafter is better for you
than the present.

01:08:15.019 --> 01:08:18.052
And verily, your Maker will give you
so that you shall be well-pleased.

01:08:19.052 --> 01:08:21.052
Did He not find you an orphan
and gave you a refuge?

01:08:23.052 --> 01:08:25.519
And he found you unaware and guided you?

01:08:26.152 --> 01:08:28.752
And he found you poor and made you rich?

01:08:30.019 --> 01:08:34.485
Therefore, treat not the orphan with
oppression and repulse not the beggar.

01:08:35.919 --> 01:08:38.352
And proclaim the Grace of your Maker."

01:08:41.719 --> 01:08:46.485
This surah gave strength and gospel
to our Prophet.

01:08:47.952 --> 01:08:54.219
There are certainly morals
to us, Islamic Ummah.

01:08:56.385 --> 01:09:01.485
We shall know that our Lord never forsake
us even though darkness

01:09:02.352 --> 01:09:04.485
and cruelty spreaded
all over the universe.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:08.185
It is our duty to build goodness

01:09:09.152 --> 01:09:11.819
and morals without doubt

01:09:12.252 --> 01:09:17.152
or quail in this universe
that is full of evil,

01:09:17.719 --> 01:09:21.519
dissension, where cruel defeated poor

01:09:22.452 --> 01:09:26.419
where brother kills brother.

01:09:27.952 --> 01:09:31.852
The reward of this grand battle will be
given to us

01:09:32.885 --> 01:09:35.019
Hereafter if not present.

01:09:36.219 --> 01:09:38.485
This is the pledge of God to faithful men.

01:09:39.819 --> 01:09:41.285
This road is certainly tough.

01:09:43.285 --> 01:09:44.752
But our God says:

01:09:46.285 --> 01:09:50.119
"Do you think you can ascend the heaven

01:09:51.152 --> 01:09:53.785
without suffering like your preceding?"

01:09:57.085 --> 01:10:02.152
The biggest sound on the sky will be
the sound of truth and right.

01:10:03.785 --> 01:10:06.452
As long as we keep our faith.

01:10:08.985 --> 01:10:10.919
And fighting without doubt.

01:10:32.419 --> 01:10:37.285
Gumustekin convinced people who thought
Tugtekin is young and not up to being Bey.

01:10:38.719 --> 01:10:41.852
Well, if it is not about being Bey
of Dodurga, what does this man want?

01:10:44.152 --> 01:10:45.419
What do you think, brother?

01:10:47.919 --> 01:10:49.252
He must want to achieve a higher place

01:10:50.052 --> 01:10:51.885
if he did not become candidate
for being Bey.

01:10:55.185 --> 01:10:56.252
What does this mean, Ertugrul?

01:10:56.952 --> 01:11:00.385
He must eventually receive recompense from
Konya for his services to Ameer Saadettin.

01:11:01.352 --> 01:11:02.819
With a big bone in his mouth.

01:11:04.152 --> 01:11:05.952
He is going to want to smush me
with that bone first.

01:11:06.885 --> 01:11:08.385
Then everybody near me.

01:11:10.752 --> 01:11:11.952
He cannot afford that, Bey.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:31.752
<i>His murderer is Aytolun, Bey.</i>

01:11:33.252 --> 01:11:34.319
<i>Tell me everything.</i>

01:11:35.485 --> 01:11:38.919
<i>Tell me otherwise I will cut you</i>
 <i>like a sacrificial here. Tell me!</i>

01:11:40.352 --> 01:11:43.119
Aytolun killed the old lady!
Goncagul knows this as well!

01:11:45.352 --> 01:11:47.852
<i>Ah, Selcan, ah! What did you do?</i>

01:11:49.352 --> 01:11:51.185
<i>Selcan is a troubled woman, Bey.</i>

01:11:51.985 --> 01:11:53.952
<i>It is obvious that you are a merciful man.</i>

01:11:54.452 --> 01:11:58.985
<i>You have a clean heart that you do</i>
 <i>not put aside of your wife of years.</i>

01:11:59.852 --> 01:12:01.152
<i>I know you have many burden.</i>

01:12:01.719 --> 01:12:04.785
<i>Being this mournful and alone</i>
 <i>does not behave you, Bey.</i>

01:12:06.152 --> 01:12:07.952
<i>I do not know what to do anymore.</i>

01:12:10.352 --> 01:12:14.719
<i>My almighty God guide me to the right.</i>

01:12:16.452 --> 01:12:19.085
<i>May truth reveals erewhile</i>
 <i>so that I come to light.</i>

01:12:20.319 --> 01:12:23.919
<i>Do not let everything to end for my wife</i>
 <i>when we are trying to stand straight</i>

01:12:24.452 --> 01:12:27.252
<i>against Mongols by uniting</i>
 <i>two nomad tents.</i>

01:12:29.985 --> 01:12:33.519
<i>I resorted to you from every evil,</i>
 <i>every malignity.</i>

01:13:02.452 --> 01:13:03.485
<i>Do I have permission, Artuk Bey?</i>

01:13:04.319 --> 01:13:05.385
Come in, Dogan Alp.

01:13:22.785 --> 01:13:23.785
Dogan Alp.

01:13:25.019 --> 01:13:26.319
You do not worry.

01:13:27.019 --> 01:13:30.719
You will protect Banu Cicek from cruelty
of tyrants with God's willing.

01:13:32.852 --> 01:13:38.019
Look, I prepared a sherbet that could
make a bear hibernate in summer.

01:13:39.919 --> 01:13:41.019
May God bless you, Artuk Bey.

01:13:44.752 --> 01:13:47.852
I had many battles but I have
never been afraid of death.

01:13:50.285 --> 01:13:54.519
However, now, I am afraid that
I cannot protect Banu Cicek.

01:13:59.419 --> 01:14:03.285
I wish you prepared something that
could set my mind ease.

01:14:07.019 --> 01:14:12.852
"For God is with those who restrain
themselves and those who do good."

01:14:14.519 --> 01:14:18.052
You shall relieve yourself, Dogan Alp.
-Thank you.

01:14:39.152 --> 01:14:41.752
Behind this veil of mystery, there are
betrayals that could debilitate

01:14:42.485 --> 01:14:45.052
not only our nomad tent but also
our government, Mother.

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:53.485
How could you reveal the truth after you
kidnap Banu Cicek, Ertugrul?

01:14:54.785 --> 01:14:56.352
I will draw Gumustekin on myself, mother.

01:14:58.052 --> 01:15:00.185
This is the only way to protect
both Selcan and Tugtekin.

01:15:04.885 --> 01:15:06.319
What kind of a game is this?

01:15:07.885 --> 01:15:10.219
Not a game, mother. It is war.

01:15:12.885 --> 01:15:15.719
A war that we will go through
without weapons but with mind.

01:15:18.752 --> 01:15:21.752
Sometimes, you have to set another fire
to quench the fire.

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:26.085
Gumustekin is going to have
to attack me desperately.

01:15:27.285 --> 01:15:29.819
Then, I am going to find
his weak point and attack.

01:15:30.485 --> 01:15:34.052
My brother Gundogdu is going
to see the truth by this way.

01:15:40.485 --> 01:15:44.152
Gundogdu resented me when he heard that
I am with you.

01:15:47.019 --> 01:15:48.352
He does not talk to Selcan, either.

01:15:49.719 --> 01:15:51.119
He is alone in his tent.

01:15:53.219 --> 01:15:57.252
What did my brother tell you when you
said it is time to migrate, mother?

01:15:58.252 --> 01:16:00.319
He said, "Our way is together
with Dodurga.

01:16:02.419 --> 01:16:07.185
We cannot separated when there is
a big trouble like Noyan."

01:16:11.052 --> 01:16:12.119
So...

01:16:16.352 --> 01:16:20.385
...what will happen if your brother
says no, Ertugrul?

01:16:23.719 --> 01:16:25.119
Then, we will go, mother.

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:31.452
What if I say no?

01:16:37.819 --> 01:16:41.252
Then, I'll go with those who believe me.

01:16:44.419 --> 01:16:46.019
If nobody believes me

01:16:48.052 --> 01:16:49.119
I will go alone.

01:17:05.052 --> 01:17:06.419
Bamsi, what did not you understand?

01:17:07.252 --> 01:17:08.452
We are chased.

01:17:09.819 --> 01:17:14.285
We should detain the Alps chasing us
for Dogan to kidnap Banu Cicek.

01:17:15.485 --> 01:17:17.519
This is why you and I'll fight.

01:17:18.185 --> 01:17:21.785
When Alps are detained with us,
Dogan will disappear.

01:17:22.285 --> 01:17:25.485
Now, you understand?
-Of course I understood that, brother.

01:17:26.119 --> 01:17:30.819
I do not understand why we have to fight
for Dogan to kidnap Banu Cicek.

01:17:32.952 --> 01:17:35.085
Brother, we need Alps these days.

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:37.752
I am heavy-handed.

01:17:38.519 --> 01:17:39.952
Why are we sacrificing you?

01:17:45.019 --> 01:17:47.485
I took the sherbet from Artuk Bey.
Are you ready?

01:17:48.119 --> 01:17:52.152
Dogan brother, look. We should not kill
Turgut to save Banu Cicek sister.

01:17:52.752 --> 01:17:53.752
It is a pity.

01:17:54.752 --> 01:17:56.352
He will become disabled at worst.

01:18:02.852 --> 01:18:04.352
Do you think me as athehist?

01:18:06.152 --> 01:18:07.385
How can you mock with me?

01:18:09.019 --> 01:18:14.385
I am neither like bears you killed in your
dream, nor like athehist you killed.

01:18:15.385 --> 01:18:18.952
Watch yourself. I shall not be the
last image you saw, Hamza.

01:18:21.152 --> 01:18:22.852
-I understood, brother.
-You understood.

01:18:23.219 --> 01:18:24.752
-I understood you.
-Good.

01:18:39.852 --> 01:18:40.852
Come.

01:18:48.185 --> 01:18:51.485
Bamsi, do not touch me ever
or I will kill you!

01:18:51.919 --> 01:18:53.885
Turgut, come here. Come here, Turgut!

01:18:54.319 --> 01:18:55.885
Go away! It will be bad!

01:18:56.252 --> 01:18:59.052
Come here! We are not over yet!

01:19:01.785 --> 01:19:05.085
Turgut! Bamsi! What are you doing?
What if Bey sees you?

01:19:05.285 --> 01:19:07.119
Dogan! You stay out of this!

01:19:07.419 --> 01:19:08.952
Go sleep! I do not want to deal
with you as well!

01:19:12.319 --> 01:19:14.052
What the hell! I am going to sleep!

01:19:16.819 --> 01:19:19.819
How could you talk about Selcan Hatun?
Do you have no conscience?

01:19:20.985 --> 01:19:22.052
Stop, brothers!

01:19:22.352 --> 01:19:24.752
Stop! Do not do this!

01:19:25.252 --> 01:19:28.419
-How could brother do this to a brother?
-Stop, do not do this!

01:19:28.785 --> 01:19:29.952
-You wanted this! Come on!
-Come on!

01:19:30.185 --> 01:19:31.185
Come on!

01:19:32.152 --> 01:19:33.819
Stop! Stop!

01:19:34.485 --> 01:19:35.485
Enough.

01:19:37.719 --> 01:19:39.052
Leave each other.

01:19:40.085 --> 01:19:42.152
-It is enough!
-Stop!

01:19:43.285 --> 01:19:44.519
How could brother do this to a brother?

01:19:45.152 --> 01:19:47.419
Enough. Stop. Stop.

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:51.919
-Shame on you!
-Shame on you!

01:19:52.319 --> 01:19:54.519
-Bamsi, enough!
-Calm down!

01:19:54.952 --> 01:19:56.485
-Bamsi, enough!
-Enough. Stop.

01:19:56.819 --> 01:19:57.852
Come here!

01:19:58.785 --> 01:20:00.519
Leave me! Leave!

01:20:01.819 --> 01:20:03.052
Okay! Okay!

01:20:29.785 --> 01:20:31.885
-Congratulations to your Seigniory, Bey.
-Thank you.

01:20:38.285 --> 01:20:40.352
Congratulations to your Seigniory, Bey.

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:42.119
Thank you, Yigit Salur.

01:20:48.319 --> 01:20:50.252
-Congratulations to your Seigniory, Bey.
-Thank you, Durgun.

01:20:57.352 --> 01:20:59.785
Mother Hayme and his family are here
to congratulate you, Bey.

01:21:00.519 --> 01:21:01.519
Welcome them.

01:21:03.519 --> 01:21:05.485
-Excuse me, Bey.
-Of course.

01:21:20.352 --> 01:21:21.452
Welcome, Mother Hayme.

01:21:26.985 --> 01:21:28.719
Congratulations to your
Seigniory, Tugtekin.

01:21:29.019 --> 01:21:30.519
Thank you. Please sit down.

01:21:39.752 --> 01:21:41.719
Congratulations to your Seigniory,
son of my uncle.

01:21:42.052 --> 01:21:43.785
Thank you. Thank you. Please.

01:21:52.052 --> 01:21:54.385
You will be the honor of Dodurga
with your Seigniory, Tugtekin Bey.

01:21:55.052 --> 01:21:57.019
-Thank you.
-May God bless you.

01:21:57.452 --> 01:21:58.719
Thank you. Please.

01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:08.185
I wish you bring power to your tent
with your justice, mercy and strength.

01:22:09.252 --> 01:22:10.719
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

01:22:14.719 --> 01:22:15.785
Thank you, please.

01:22:17.785 --> 01:22:19.085
Congratulations to your
Seigniory, Tugtekin Bey.

01:22:19.385 --> 01:22:21.085
Thank you, Halime Hatun. Please.

01:22:38.852 --> 01:22:40.919
-Peace be upon you, brothers.
-And peace be upon you.

01:22:41.152 --> 01:22:42.185
And peace be upon you.

01:22:42.819 --> 01:22:43.885
What is going on, Dogan?

01:22:44.219 --> 01:22:45.952
I brought hot sherbet to Banu Cicek Hatun.

01:22:46.252 --> 01:22:47.985
What are you doing with this
murderer woman?

01:22:49.185 --> 01:22:51.952
It will be revealed if she is the murderer
or not tomorrow at the court, brother.

01:22:52.819 --> 01:22:54.785
Black sheep and white sheep
will be separated tomorrow.

01:22:55.485 --> 01:22:58.219
Go away, Dogan. We cannot let anybody in.

01:23:02.919 --> 01:23:03.952
Okay, then.

01:23:04.352 --> 01:23:06.352
You shall drink. It will make you warm.

01:23:13.085 --> 01:23:16.252
If you have on your conscience,
you shall give some to Banu Cicek Hatun.

01:24:04.452 --> 01:24:08.185
May your Seigniory keep alive.

01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:10.985
May justice seep into you.

01:24:12.119 --> 01:24:13.119
Amen.

01:24:13.452 --> 01:24:20.285
Bey, in our morals, Seigniory celebration
is unfortunately based on another grief.

01:24:21.919 --> 01:24:25.285
Grief of Korkut Bey will always
be in our hearts, you should know.

01:24:25.952 --> 01:24:26.985
Thank you.

01:24:28.719 --> 01:24:34.219
The holy day will come when I end the
sedition that is gnawing my nomad tent.

01:24:44.452 --> 01:24:46.319
Gumustekin Bey and Goncagul Hatun
are here, Bey.

01:24:47.185 --> 01:24:48.185
Let them in.

01:25:00.519 --> 01:25:01.519
Welcome.

01:25:05.019 --> 01:25:06.785
May God make your Seigniory
permanent, Bey.

01:25:07.885 --> 01:25:09.352
Thank you. Sit down.

01:25:12.319 --> 01:25:13.785
God bless your Seigniory, Bey.

01:25:15.785 --> 01:25:18.219
Thank you, Goncagul Hatun. Thank you.
Sit down, please.

01:25:31.985 --> 01:25:37.285
Beys of Kayi believed on me like the
Beys of Dodurga

01:25:38.785 --> 01:25:42.285
and came to congratulate me by honoring
my marquee. Thank you.

01:25:44.285 --> 01:25:50.719
I hope that association of two tent will
continue until we stop Mongol atheists.

01:25:51.385 --> 01:25:52.385
If God permits.

01:25:53.019 --> 01:25:55.752
The biggest inheritance
that Korkut Bey left us

01:25:56.919 --> 01:25:58.352
is the association of two nomad tents.

01:25:59.452 --> 01:26:05.319
It is all of our duty to do necessary
for handing it to this.

01:26:07.885 --> 01:26:12.452
Like my father said, two nomad tent's
sharing a common fate is above everything.

01:26:16.919 --> 01:26:19.719
I will show the assertion of this
holy position that I took

01:26:20.419 --> 01:26:24.919
over in my painful day with my justice
and mercy, like Ertugrul Bey said.

01:26:27.719 --> 01:26:34.152
I hope the murderer of my father will be
served right in tomorrow's court.

01:26:37.952 --> 01:26:39.019
If God permits.

01:26:41.819 --> 01:26:42.885
If God permits.

01:26:43.285 --> 01:26:44.952
If God permits, if God permits.

01:27:24.385 --> 01:27:25.385
Dogan Alp!

01:27:28.752 --> 01:27:29.752
We are leaving, Cicek Hatun.

01:27:30.785 --> 01:27:31.985
Are you out of your mind?

01:27:34.019 --> 01:27:35.119
Why're you doing this?

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:39.819
Do you know what will happen to you?

01:27:40.385 --> 01:27:42.385
It is the order of Bey. Let's hurry.

01:27:43.052 --> 01:27:44.952
I should kidnap you to reveal the truth.

01:27:49.085 --> 01:27:51.119
First, we should take the guards
inside and tie them.

01:28:03.252 --> 01:28:04.885
<i>Do I have permission, Gundogdu Bey?</i>

01:28:05.452 --> 01:28:06.785
Come in, Gumustekin Bey.

01:28:15.352 --> 01:28:17.952
I am afraid that the accusation
at two nomad tents is damaged.

01:28:19.185 --> 01:28:20.185
Is something wrong?

01:28:22.885 --> 01:28:26.085
When Tugtekin Bey hears about
Selcan Hatun's confessions tomorrow.

01:28:28.319 --> 01:28:30.819
We cannot restrain him easy like this
when he will heard.

01:28:35.819 --> 01:28:41.019
Goncagul will testify at the court
as you wish.

01:28:41.385 --> 01:28:43.752
But, you should know that

01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:48.785
her words are going to harm both
nomad tents deeply not only us.

01:28:51.219 --> 01:28:52.919
You should be ready
for this, Gundogdu Bey.

01:28:53.419 --> 01:28:55.985
Tell me what you know, Gumustekin Bey.

01:28:56.385 --> 01:28:58.419
Ask this to my daughter, not me.

01:29:00.085 --> 01:29:02.085
She shall explain it all over.

01:29:04.285 --> 01:29:07.952
Then, if you let me, I want to speak
to Goncagul Hatun.

01:29:10.385 --> 01:29:11.385
Go, then.

01:29:12.119 --> 01:29:14.919
Maybe you will prevent the disaster
that will happen tomorrow.

01:30:15.085 --> 01:30:16.452
I want to wish you good night, mother.

01:30:17.719 --> 01:30:18.852
Do you want anything from me?

01:30:19.252 --> 01:30:21.485
Gokce daughter went to bring fresh water.

01:30:23.485 --> 01:30:25.719
I will take medicine that
Artuk Bey prescribed.

01:30:27.485 --> 01:30:29.385
I will be better tomorrow, if God permits.

01:30:30.052 --> 01:30:31.385
If God permits. If God permits.

01:30:34.319 --> 01:30:37.985
You shall stay straight
in the court tomorrow

01:30:39.085 --> 01:30:41.452
so that everybody shall see the
puissance of our Seigniory.

01:30:43.785 --> 01:30:45.785
You are the only support of me at this
very painful day of me, mother.

01:30:47.219 --> 01:30:49.485
I know. I know.

01:30:51.785 --> 01:30:53.185
I never doubt that.

01:30:55.252 --> 01:31:00.152
My son, late justice
is no good for anybody.

01:31:02.752 --> 01:31:08.485
Especially when there are
ominous clouds over us.

01:31:10.052 --> 01:31:11.219
What do you want to mean, mother?

01:31:15.219 --> 01:31:16.219
Nothing.

01:31:18.052 --> 01:31:19.052
Mother.

01:31:26.285 --> 01:31:33.119
Our peace that we have when your father
is alive must have resented somebody.

01:31:34.719 --> 01:31:37.719
They have spreaded rumors about us.

01:31:39.319 --> 01:31:42.252
You'll hear this at the court yourself.

01:31:46.519 --> 01:31:51.485
It is hurting me more to hear about
these impure gossips

01:31:54.119 --> 01:31:56.052
while I am mourning for my Korkut Bey.

01:31:57.185 --> 01:32:00.352
What are you hiding but knowing?

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:09.285
It is very hard for me to talk about
these at my Bey's marquee.

01:32:14.452 --> 01:32:16.019
However, since you ask

01:32:17.919 --> 01:32:22.819
maybe it will be better for you to know
it as the Bey of this nomad tent.

01:32:31.285 --> 01:32:32.919
<i>Do I have permission, Goncagul Hatun?</i>

01:32:33.852 --> 01:32:34.952
Come in, Gundogdu Bey.

01:32:42.052 --> 01:32:43.785
I have the permission of Gumustekin Bey.

01:32:44.719 --> 01:32:46.219
I want to talk to you.

01:32:49.919 --> 01:32:53.885
I heard that you want me to testify
at the court, Bey.

01:32:55.719 --> 01:32:58.885
Obviously, Selcan Hatun confused you
as well, with slanders.

01:32:59.752 --> 01:33:03.452
You broke the pitcher where unpleasant
secrets were kept.

01:33:04.285 --> 01:33:07.019
It is the best. It was about time.

01:33:09.919 --> 01:33:11.952
I will tell everything.
I'll testify at the court.

01:33:13.752 --> 01:33:15.852
Then, you will learn all of it, Bey.

01:33:17.119 --> 01:33:20.885
Goncagul Hatun, I do not know
if I see the court.

01:33:21.919 --> 01:33:26.785
Tell me everything right here right now.
I do not have patient any more.

01:33:55.085 --> 01:33:58.985
This necklace is the necklace that
my mother gave to Selcan at the wedding

01:34:00.085 --> 01:34:01.985
and her mother gave it to her formerly.

01:34:03.985 --> 01:34:05.052
Why do you have it?

01:34:10.752 --> 01:34:15.519
Selcan Hatun is a more dangerous woman
then I guess, Gundogdu Bey.

01:34:16.352 --> 01:34:18.085
Excuse me for saying this.

01:34:20.052 --> 01:34:22.519
It seems that she wanted to create
trouble with this necklace

01:34:22.952 --> 01:34:24.419
that is the inheritance of her mother.

01:34:27.252 --> 01:34:28.719
What do you mean, Goncagul?

01:34:29.985 --> 01:34:35.385
I saw with my own eyes that she tried to
buy that old lady with this necklace, Bey.

01:34:38.285 --> 01:34:40.352
Tell me. Tell me everything.

01:34:42.385 --> 01:34:45.219
Tell me, mother.
What are you hiding from me?

01:34:49.252 --> 01:34:53.519
Selcan, she is creating trouble
in the nomad tent again.

01:34:55.452 --> 01:35:00.219
Like plague her lies are
spreading around the tent.

01:35:03.285 --> 01:35:05.418
<i>Tell me mother. Tell me so that</i>
 <i>I can do the necessary.</i>

01:35:06.418 --> 01:35:07.418
<i>Dying</i>

01:35:08.252 --> 01:35:13.319
is better than being
slandered by her.

01:35:16.085 --> 01:35:17.152
<i>She says</i>

01:35:18.719 --> 01:35:20.252
I had illegitimate

01:35:22.319 --> 01:35:26.985
relationship with Korkut Bey
when your mother was alive.

01:35:30.385 --> 01:35:35.019
Every word comes out of that
ominous woman.

01:35:39.219 --> 01:35:45.719
I did not press the issue
for not upsetting your father

01:35:46.985 --> 01:35:48.252
when he was alive.

01:35:50.285 --> 01:35:52.185
<i>I am exhausted any more.</i>

01:35:55.452 --> 01:35:59.085
Selcan has kept talking

01:36:00.152 --> 01:36:04.519
since the day Gundogdu Bey
wanted to marry Goncagul.

01:36:07.452 --> 01:36:08.752
Is this her problem?

01:36:11.119 --> 01:36:12.119
Yes.

01:36:13.985 --> 01:36:16.419
I did not want to talk about this.

01:36:18.719 --> 01:36:20.752
But maybe it is better for you

01:36:23.319 --> 01:36:24.785
to hear this from me.

01:36:26.219 --> 01:36:28.852
Tell me, mother. Tell me. Tell me.

01:36:38.785 --> 01:36:40.985
What do you mean, Goncagul?
Tell me straight.

01:36:43.785 --> 01:36:46.852
I was returning collecting healing herbs
for my father's feet.

01:36:48.252 --> 01:36:49.352
<i>I hear something.</i>

01:36:49.985 --> 01:36:52.985
<i>I saw them talking fevered.</i>

01:36:53.419 --> 01:36:56.785
<i>Old lady threw away the necklace</i>
 <i>that Selcan gave her by saying that</i>

01:36:56.985 --> 01:36:58.852
<i>she could not do this to Aytolun Hatun.</i>

01:36:59.485 --> 01:37:01.819
<i>I knew Selcan was up to no good.</i>

01:37:03.819 --> 01:37:05.852
I wanted to go and tell this to my aunt.

01:37:06.785 --> 01:37:10.352
By the time, we heard about that
an old lady's body was found.

01:37:11.352 --> 01:37:12.785
When everybody left

01:37:13.452 --> 01:37:15.952
I went and got the necklace from
where the old lady threw it.

01:37:17.319 --> 01:37:19.052
<i>-What did you tell her?</i>
 <i>-I did not tell.</i>

01:37:19.285 --> 01:37:20.919
<i>-I say what did you tell her?</i>
 <i>-I did not tell.</i>

01:37:24.185 --> 01:37:25.219
<i>What is this?</i>

01:37:28.019 --> 01:37:29.252
<i>I did not tell her anything!</i>

01:37:32.252 --> 01:37:34.352
She forgot about the necklace out
of her guilt.

01:37:35.185 --> 01:37:37.019
Maybe, she searched but could not find it.

01:37:38.919 --> 01:37:40.085
I took the necklace and hide it.

01:37:42.385 --> 01:37:43.519
I understood everything.

01:37:46.419 --> 01:37:47.919
What did you understand, Goncagul?

01:37:49.319 --> 01:37:52.419
Tell me for God's sake. What?

01:37:53.319 --> 01:37:55.385
That Selcan killed that old lady.

01:37:58.019 --> 01:38:02.419
Then, she started to threaten me every day
to get off Gundogdu Bey's back.

01:38:04.119 --> 01:38:07.052
One day, I could not resist and tell her

01:38:07.352 --> 01:38:09.385
that I had the necklace
and I knew everything.

01:38:10.319 --> 01:38:12.219
<i>I know that you killed that old lady.</i>

01:38:15.052 --> 01:38:16.152
<i>What are you saying?</i>

01:38:16.452 --> 01:38:21.885
<i>There was your necklace on her body.</i>
 <i>It is obvious that you killed her.</i>

01:38:22.119 --> 01:38:25.385
<i>Because she did not want to take it.</i>
 <i>The proof is your necklace.</i>

01:38:25.852 --> 01:38:29.985
<i>And I have it. I kept quiet for you</i>
 <i>not to be any more shame for Bey.</i>

01:38:30.252 --> 01:38:35.785
<i>But with a tiny mistake of yours,</i>
 <i>Gundogdu Bey, Korkut Bey</i>

01:38:36.152 --> 01:38:38.052
<i>and Mother Hayme will learn the truth.</i>

01:38:38.252 --> 01:38:40.352
<i>I will make you executed, Selcan.</i>

01:38:41.319 --> 01:38:44.252
<i>Stay away from us and our happiness.</i>

01:38:51.152 --> 01:38:54.385
Goncagul, do you know what you say?

01:38:54.819 --> 01:38:55.819
I know.

01:38:56.285 --> 01:38:59.119
And I will tell about all of this
at the court, Gundogdu Bey.

01:39:00.819 --> 01:39:04.219
Selcan killed that old lady, is that so?

01:39:04.952 --> 01:39:05.985
Yes.

01:39:08.852 --> 01:39:11.019
She will answer for this at the court.

01:39:14.285 --> 01:39:15.485
What else do you know?

01:39:17.252 --> 01:39:20.185
It does not behave me to speak
if I cannot prove it.

01:39:21.119 --> 01:39:25.419
No, Goncagul. No.
I am not judging you here.

01:39:26.452 --> 01:39:28.085
All I want to know is the truth.

01:39:34.785 --> 01:39:36.285
Is what Aytolun Hatun told is true?

01:39:38.319 --> 01:39:39.319
Is it true?

01:39:40.352 --> 01:39:41.819
My beautiful sister.

01:39:43.052 --> 01:39:46.152
When will you give up ruining
your life at the entrances?

01:39:47.919 --> 01:39:50.319
When will you give up bandying about?

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:53.152
I am out of patient now!

01:39:54.319 --> 01:39:55.519
Tell me the truth now!

01:39:56.119 --> 01:39:57.252
Tell me, is it true?

01:40:17.252 --> 01:40:18.452
<i>Tell me the truth anymore!</i>

01:40:19.119 --> 01:40:20.219
Permission!

01:40:27.152 --> 01:40:28.919
-Bey!
-Get out, Gokce.

01:40:29.219 --> 01:40:30.719
-Tugtekin.
-Get out, Gokce.

01:40:30.885 --> 01:40:33.985
-Bey.
-I said get out! I said get out!

01:40:34.185 --> 01:40:36.819
Bey, I will not go anywhere
until I learn the truth!

01:40:38.852 --> 01:40:42.985
This devil sister of yours was spreading
about illegitimate relationship

01:40:43.185 --> 01:40:45.219
with Aytolun Hatun and my father.

01:40:46.385 --> 01:40:47.985
Even before my mother died!

01:40:53.252 --> 01:40:54.352
Sister, is this true?

01:40:55.019 --> 01:40:58.452
Yes. But not slander. All truth.

01:40:59.752 --> 01:41:02.452
-Bey.
-Tell me, Selcan Hatun.

01:41:02.885 --> 01:41:05.752
Tell me that I will not be your death.
Tell me!

01:41:12.452 --> 01:41:13.719
Do I have permission, Mother Hayme?

01:41:16.752 --> 01:41:17.852
What gives, Abdurrahman?

01:41:18.752 --> 01:41:22.419
Mother Hayme, Tugtekin Bey
got into Selcan Hatun's tent.

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:36.319
She slandered my aunt and Korkut Bey

01:41:36.985 --> 01:41:38.919
like they were having affair
before marriage.

01:41:39.985 --> 01:41:41.152
On the top of it

01:41:41.352 --> 01:41:45.085
she said that my aunt killed Duru Hatun
because she wanted to be woman of Bey.

01:41:45.952 --> 01:41:47.385
What should I say more, Gundogdu Bey?

01:41:48.085 --> 01:41:51.985
She tried to cheat Banu Cicek
with her slanders and to kill them.

01:41:55.252 --> 01:41:56.452
Do you know why, Bey?

01:41:57.319 --> 01:41:59.285
For me not to become your wife.

01:42:00.985 --> 01:42:04.752
She tried to cross us by blaming me,
my aunt and my father.

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:06.385
Is it not enough?

01:42:07.085 --> 01:42:08.452
What is done is done to that stupid girl.

01:42:09.352 --> 01:42:15.819
I will not let Selcan Hatun
to get out of this blameless.

01:42:16.852 --> 01:42:20.852
Even if I gain your anger,
I will not let this go.

01:42:24.019 --> 01:42:25.152
Take this necklace, Bey.

01:42:27.319 --> 01:42:28.419
Give it to your mother.

01:42:29.219 --> 01:42:34.019
So that, she will see herself
how unconscientious her daughter is.

01:42:52.119 --> 01:42:53.519
-Speak woman!
-Bey!

01:42:54.485 --> 01:42:55.885
Please do not do this.

01:42:56.152 --> 01:42:59.285
Tell me what you know about Aytolun Hatun
and my father. Talk.

01:42:59.752 --> 01:43:01.519
Nor is this all, Bey. There is more.

01:43:01.852 --> 01:43:04.052
The ignoble who set you on me
told you less.

01:43:05.385 --> 01:43:06.385
Speak.

01:43:06.719 --> 01:43:09.085
Have you never suspected that your mother
who could get water

01:43:09.285 --> 01:43:12.185
from a flint died suddenly, Tugtekin Bey?

01:43:14.519 --> 01:43:17.052
-What do you mean?
-Do you not still understand?

01:43:18.419 --> 01:43:19.785
I shall tell you one more.

01:43:20.485 --> 01:43:25.319
Both your mother's and your father's
murderer is still in your nomad tent!

01:43:33.519 --> 01:43:34.719
Tugtekin Bey!

01:43:37.719 --> 01:43:38.719
Tugtekin!

01:43:44.737 --> 01:43:46.470
Don't do it, brother.

01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:58.037
Did you know about
her slanders?

01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:03.503
You knew, but kept quiet.
Is that so?

01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:11.970
She says Aytolun Hatun killed
my parents. But you still tell me to stop.

01:44:14.937 --> 01:44:16.870
We shall wait until the trial,
Tugtekin Bey.

01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:18.803
Screw your trial!

01:44:20.037 --> 01:44:21.737
Are you on her side, too?

01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:24.470
Ertugrul! Tugtekin!

01:44:33.703 --> 01:44:38.337
Mother Hayme, your daughter Selcan
is involved in my father's death.

01:44:38.803 --> 01:44:40.370
I will make her talk.

01:44:40.603 --> 01:44:44.337
She will talk at the trial
whether you like it or not.

01:44:45.303 --> 01:44:49.037
Now, get out of here.
You are making things worse.

01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:54.737
I ran out of patience, Mother Hayme.

01:44:56.337 --> 01:44:59.903
Whoever comes my way,
will have his share of my rage.

01:45:01.737 --> 01:45:07.303
Neither your words nor your tent raid
are what is expected of a Bey.

01:45:08.670 --> 01:45:11.437
I know you are grieving
and I will keep quiet.

01:45:12.303 --> 01:45:15.403
But, go away.

01:45:17.303 --> 01:45:19.237
You are with her, too?

01:45:27.537 --> 01:45:30.603
Tugtekin, get a hold of yourself.

01:45:32.737 --> 01:45:34.837
Questioning Selcan and

01:45:35.303 --> 01:45:38.670
punishing her if necessary
is my duty.

01:45:39.537 --> 01:45:40.870
Not yours.

01:45:44.703 --> 01:45:47.703
Selcan. Go to your tent.

01:45:49.403 --> 01:45:50.636
Mother.

01:46:08.637 --> 01:46:11.303
I hope you don't have anything to
do with this, Ertugrul.

01:46:11.803 --> 01:46:14.537
One day you will beg for
forgiveness from all of us, cousin.

01:46:17.403 --> 01:46:22.570
If you are involved in this,
there will be blood.

01:46:46.737 --> 01:46:48.370
-Abdurrahman.
-Yes, Mother.

01:46:48.803 --> 01:46:51.503
Place two guards in front of
Selcan Hatun's tent.

01:46:52.237 --> 01:46:53.437
At once, mother.

01:48:40.537 --> 01:48:44.570
-Did Banu Cicek get away, Ertugrul?
-Dogan was there to help her, mother.

01:49:02.337 --> 01:49:03.770
Selcan is my lady.

01:49:06.937 --> 01:49:09.270
We've shared the same bed
for years.

01:49:10.803 --> 01:49:12.537
How could she do this to us?

01:49:16.803 --> 01:49:19.503
What did she do?
What are you talking about, son?

01:49:22.237 --> 01:49:25.470
Your late mother's necklace.

01:49:30.670 --> 01:49:33.403
Selcan gave it to
the old lady who died.

01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:47.470
Goncagul said she saw it herself.

01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:51.703
Goncagul Hatun's words
don't prove anything, brother.

01:49:51.837 --> 01:49:53.770
Don't tell me anything, Ertugrul.

01:49:54.437 --> 01:49:56.903
Let's just keep our mouths shut
until the hearing.

01:50:01.737 --> 01:50:05.237
Goncagul says Selcan
killed that woman.

01:50:06.970 --> 01:50:08.637
This necklace is the proof.

01:50:09.303 --> 01:50:12.637
So, Selcan must be involved in
my uncle's murder, mother.

01:50:16.036 --> 01:50:17.737
Selcan ruined us, mother.

01:50:18.603 --> 01:50:21.003
Not only us but the whole tribe.

01:50:25.670 --> 01:50:26.770
Gundogdu Bey.

01:50:30.037 --> 01:50:31.870
Please open your eyes.

01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:36.437
Tugtekin Bey raided
Selcan's tent just now.

01:50:37.303 --> 01:50:39.503
Don't you see how they
are playing tricks on you?

01:50:39.570 --> 01:50:40.803
Halime!

01:51:15.537 --> 01:51:16.703
Tugtekin.

01:51:22.737 --> 01:51:28.303
I care about neither Ertugrul,
nor my sister, nor my mom.

01:51:30.337 --> 01:51:32.303
You should know that
I am with you forever.

01:51:35.003 --> 01:51:37.303
Your marquee is my home.

01:51:39.503 --> 01:51:41.503
Thank you, my love.

01:51:42.737 --> 01:51:44.403
I don't doubt that.

01:51:45.437 --> 01:51:47.970
I know that you will be with me

01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:50.770
when it is time to
avenge my father.

01:52:08.303 --> 01:52:09.970
Did you learn everything?

01:52:13.837 --> 01:52:15.303
Everything?

01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:17.737
Everything.

01:52:22.537 --> 01:52:26.003
Then, it is up to you

01:52:27.303 --> 01:52:31.937
to clear our name
at the court tomorrow.

01:52:34.803 --> 01:52:35.870
Tugtekin!

01:52:37.970 --> 01:52:39.570
What have you done?

01:52:40.403 --> 01:52:42.603
Bursting into the tent
of Bey's lady?

01:52:43.303 --> 01:52:45.437
That tent is my honor,
don't you know that?

01:52:45.970 --> 01:52:50.337
He's still grieving, Gundogdu Bey.
You would have done the same thing.

01:52:50.537 --> 01:52:52.870
I found about all the dirt
from her poisoned tongue.

01:52:52.937 --> 01:52:55.370
What could I do? She should
be grateful that she's alive.

01:52:55.470 --> 01:52:57.437
Know your place, Tugtekin!

01:52:58.503 --> 01:53:01.370
If this is the matter,
her blood is halal to me.

01:53:01.603 --> 01:53:04.903
-Is it your duty to execute her?
-Your mother said the same thing.

01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:09.003
-What kind of a snake you married?
-Tugtekin.

01:53:09.237 --> 01:53:10.770
Enough!

01:53:11.537 --> 01:53:14.470
Obviously, everybody
wants to see Selcan dead.

01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:18.970
However, nobody cares about me
and Korkut Bey's dignity.

01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:24.537
How can we live with this shame?

01:53:24.603 --> 01:53:27.537
Gundogdu Bey, how?

01:53:28.770 --> 01:53:29.970
How?

01:53:30.803 --> 01:53:31.937
How?

01:53:34.403 --> 01:53:35.470
Mother.

01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:20.437
-Peace be upon you, brother.
-And peace be upon you.

01:54:25.503 --> 01:54:26.837
I made some food for you.

01:54:28.703 --> 01:54:31.437
You should cross the mountains
before they notice you are gone.

01:54:32.437 --> 01:54:33.970
May God be with you.

01:54:35.303 --> 01:54:36.803
God bless you all, brother.

01:54:44.670 --> 01:54:47.403
I will always remember your help.

01:54:48.437 --> 01:54:51.903
As long as I breathe, everybody
will hear about your courage.

01:54:52.603 --> 01:54:53.703
Thank you.

01:56:03.903 --> 01:56:05.537
-Who did this?
-Dogan Alp.

01:56:06.703 --> 01:56:09.803
He came over and I don't
remember the rest.

01:56:10.603 --> 01:56:11.903
We all passed out.

01:56:24.737 --> 01:56:27.037
Don't let the trial take too long,
Gumustekin Bey.

01:56:28.437 --> 01:56:30.470
The longer that it takes,
the angrier people will get.

01:56:32.003 --> 01:56:36.270
It will be all over before noon, Bey.
Everything is crystal clear.

01:56:37.837 --> 01:56:39.903
Then, it will be Selcan's turn.

01:56:41.337 --> 01:56:43.470
She will pay for her slanders.

01:56:45.437 --> 01:56:49.470
I will go to Konya right after the trial,
Bey, if I have your permission.

01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:53.470
Ameer Sadettin Kobek wants to see me.

01:56:54.537 --> 01:56:55.937
Permission is yours, Gumustekin Bey.

01:56:56.703 --> 01:56:59.503
Give my regards to Sultan Aleaddin
and Ameer Sadettin.

01:57:04.937 --> 01:57:07.370
-May I come in, Bey?
-Come in, Kaya.

01:57:11.537 --> 01:57:12.803
Bey, Banu Cicek has escaped.

01:57:16.003 --> 01:57:17.870
-How?
-I don't know, Bey.

01:57:17.937 --> 01:57:20.237
However it happened
after Dogan Alp's arrival.

01:57:21.903 --> 01:57:25.437
-Ertugrul!
-What does Ertugrul have to do with this?

01:57:28.903 --> 01:57:30.903
There must be something
they are afraid of.

01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:34.603
Otherwise, why would they do this?

01:57:36.837 --> 01:57:40.937
Now, do you understand
why they postponed the hearing, Bey?

01:57:43.303 --> 01:57:45.403
If Turgut and Bamsi are still in
the tent, catch them immediately.

01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:46.603
As your command, Bey.

01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:50.737
There is no need for a trial
anymore, Bey.

01:57:50.970 --> 01:57:53.537
Their blood is halal to you.

01:57:54.037 --> 01:57:58.970
However, don't you forget that
Gundogdu stands for justice.

01:57:59.537 --> 01:58:03.037
Obviously, it is Ertugrul who
misleads Hayme Hatun.

01:58:04.537 --> 01:58:06.903
Thus we discovered the
source of treason.

01:58:07.937 --> 01:58:11.870
When I'm in Konya, I will discuss
this with Ameer Sadettin.

01:58:12.970 --> 01:58:19.470
We will destroy Ertugrul,
with the help of the state if needed.

01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:03.570
Why did you get involved in
something dangerous like this?

01:59:09.603 --> 01:59:11.270
Is it because you believe me...

01:59:12.670 --> 01:59:14.737
...or because Ertugrul Bey told you to?

01:59:18.903 --> 01:59:20.670
I would die for Bey
if he wants me to.

01:59:25.370 --> 01:59:26.737
However, this time...

01:59:30.537 --> 01:59:31.870
This time, what?

01:59:34.703 --> 01:59:36.003
It's different this time.

01:59:41.737 --> 01:59:43.403
I don't know how to say this.

01:59:45.570 --> 01:59:46.737
However...

01:59:51.903 --> 01:59:53.603
It is for you this time.

01:59:55.537 --> 01:59:56.703
I...

02:00:07.503 --> 02:00:10.237
I cannot send you to the gallows...

02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:13.637
...when I can't even bear
to see you bruise your arm.

02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:29.970
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:47.037
There is no death for those
who die for their beloved.

02:00:48.803 --> 02:00:51.437
There is no grief for those
who stand up to cruelty.

02:00:54.803 --> 02:00:58.470
There is unity and love
for those who take the road.

02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:08.503
Come with me.

02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:33.837
Did you help
Banu Cicek escape?

02:01:46.237 --> 02:01:48.370
You never believed
that I love Tugtekin.

02:01:49.037 --> 02:01:53.437
You always thought I was after
him to avenge Ertugrul.

02:01:54.903 --> 02:01:56.403
You wanted us two married

02:01:57.570 --> 02:02:01.703
for your own interests, although
he loves me like a sister.

02:02:03.570 --> 02:02:06.270
Now, you are trying to prevent
brother Gundogdu

02:02:07.003 --> 02:02:10.637
and Goncagul's marriage for
your own interests again.

02:02:11.503 --> 02:02:13.903
With your evil ideas and slanders.

02:02:15.803 --> 02:02:17.003
Enough!

02:02:18.837 --> 02:02:24.770
Don't you see, evil is all around us
and spreading its poison?

02:02:25.303 --> 02:02:29.403
Don't you understand,
Korkut Bey's death is just a beginning?

02:02:29.937 --> 02:02:32.237
They'll kill whoever
in stands their way

02:02:32.370 --> 02:02:35.770
until they reach their goals.

02:02:37.037 --> 02:02:41.237
This also includes
Gundogdu and Tugtekin Beys.

02:02:42.603 --> 02:02:46.003
Enough already.
Don't be so naive, sister.

02:02:47.870 --> 02:02:49.903
You think everybody is like you, right?

02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:53.870
How many people did you hurt?

02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:57.837
You broke up families...

02:03:00.037 --> 02:03:03.303
...including your own.
Wasn't that enough?

02:03:07.970 --> 02:03:11.837
You always wanted me to be
a Bey's wife. I am now.

02:03:14.970 --> 02:03:17.437
But not through your
dirty games this time.

02:03:18.237 --> 02:03:21.637
It's because I love him,
and he loves me.

02:03:27.503 --> 02:03:32.670
If you were involved
in Banu Cicek's escape...

02:03:33.837 --> 02:03:37.370
...if what Aytolun Mother said is true...

02:03:38.737 --> 02:03:42.803
...do not doubt that I will do my best
to see you punished for it

02:03:42.937 --> 02:03:46.570
as the wife of Tugtekin,
the Bey of Dodurga.

02:04:41.403 --> 02:04:43.037
-What is going on?
-Get out!

02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:46.637
-What is going on, brother?
-I said get out.

02:04:57.837 --> 02:04:59.603
We will, brother.

02:05:02.537 --> 02:05:03.870
We'll get out.

02:05:23.970 --> 02:05:26.770
-Where is Dogan, Turgut?
-He was gone when we woke up.

02:05:28.970 --> 02:05:30.470
Maybe he went hunting, Bey.

02:05:35.637 --> 02:05:38.903
-Where is Dogan, Bamsi?
-We don't know, Bey.

02:05:40.803 --> 02:05:44.003
Right, brother Turgut?
We don't know.

02:05:44.603 --> 02:05:45.937
We do not know, Bey.

02:06:00.337 --> 02:06:02.037
Let's see what your Bey
has to say about that.

02:06:04.003 --> 02:06:05.537
Tie them up and take them away.

02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:36.737
Things are more
difficult now, mother.

02:06:38.803 --> 02:06:40.937
They will be harder
on us after this.

02:06:43.570 --> 02:06:45.570
We have to stop this dirty game.

02:06:48.403 --> 02:06:50.937
Let this all come to an end.
Enough already.

02:06:57.670 --> 02:06:59.270
<i>Ertugrul, come here!</i>

02:07:06.970 --> 02:07:08.803
<i>Ertugrul, come here!</i>

02:07:13.570 --> 02:07:14.870
It is time, mother.

02:07:21.670 --> 02:07:23.337
Come outside, Ertugrul!
