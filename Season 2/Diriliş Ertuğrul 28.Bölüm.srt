Episode 28 will start after 12:3 min

12:03.161 --> 12:05.719
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:08.665 --> 12:12.202
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:12.527 --> 12:15.421
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

12:40.641 --> 12:47.201
I want you to know that I'm very happy
to have met a noble warrior like yourself.

12:48.041 --> 12:49.361
What do you want from me?

12:53.041 --> 12:57.801
You can be sure that I want nothing
but your friendship, Turk.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.721
Us Moguls are good at choosing our
enemies and friends.

13:06.361 --> 13:11.201
We'd like Ertugrul to become
one of our friends.

13:11.721 --> 13:14.841
You couldn't be my enemy,
let alone my friend.

13:17.281 --> 13:20.361
Don't rush, Ertugrul. Keep calm.

13:24.921 --> 13:26.241
Give him some water.

13:48.481 --> 13:50.601
I was told that you wouldn't quit easily.

14:00.521 --> 14:02.241
A cavalcade is coming towards here.

14:08.761 --> 14:10.561
Your men are searching for you.

14:23.961 --> 14:25.401
If only they could find you.

14:27.801 --> 14:32.241
Victory will always be ours as long as
we fight against pikers like you.

14:59.641 --> 15:03.121
Split up in different directions!
Don't leave any traces behind!

15:08.523 --> 15:13.523
-This can't be happening! God, no, Aykiz!
-Turgut, my son.

15:22.590 --> 15:23.590
Aykiz!

15:25.623 --> 15:27.357
-My son.
-Aykiz

15:27.657 --> 15:30.757
Turgut, pull yourself together, son.

15:34.157 --> 15:35.223
No!

15:35.590 --> 15:37.657
You should be proud now that
your wife has become a martyr.

15:44.757 --> 15:46.957
-Let us lay her down.
-No. No.

15:47.223 --> 15:48.223
Turgut

15:52.157 --> 15:56.823
Slowly, gently. My poor daughter.

15:59.757 --> 16:04.823
This glory and honor
would suffice you in both worlds.

16:15.790 --> 16:20.690
Hopefully, God will help you
unite once more in his heaven.

16:25.457 --> 16:28.490
Aykiz, Aykiz, no, Aykiz!

16:29.923 --> 16:32.590
Turgut, son, it is alright.

16:34.590 --> 16:35.590
Aykiz!

16:38.223 --> 16:39.223
Aykiz!

16:47.757 --> 16:52.857
Henceforth, embrace Gokche
who grew up an orphan

16:55.590 --> 16:57.557
as your daughter Aykiz.

17:00.723 --> 17:01.723
Would you, Father Demir?

17:36.757 --> 17:38.657
Help me, God or I'll lose my mind!

17:42.823 --> 17:43.823
Bey!

17:48.757 --> 17:49.757
Bey!

18:11.670 --> 18:14.036
Keep calm, Dogan Alp! Keep calm.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.803
He's survived many hardships.
He will survive this one as well.

18:19.203 --> 18:21.870
Do you hear me? Pull yourself together.

18:33.536 --> 18:34.936
Infidel Noyan was here.

18:36.236 --> 18:39.136
As long as that tyrant
who did this to people is alive,

18:39.736 --> 18:41.736
we cannot be at peace.

18:45.770 --> 18:47.770
Mongols has invade
everywhere with their tyranny.

18:49.936 --> 18:52.270
The fear of the Mongols proceeds
their invasion.

18:54.170 --> 18:56.370
They don't even have mercy
for the ones who surrender.

19:08.903 --> 19:11.403
There are no traces here, Bey.

19:50.836 --> 19:52.436
Water! Bring some water!

20:05.470 --> 20:06.470
This is Bey's.

20:19.436 --> 20:20.436
Bey!

20:22.736 --> 20:23.736
Bey!

20:25.936 --> 20:26.936
Bey!

20:29.170 --> 20:30.170
Bey!

20:31.836 --> 20:34.670
They killed Bey! He is dead.

20:43.536 --> 20:44.536
Bey!

20:48.436 --> 20:51.003
They killed Bey! He is dead.

21:50.636 --> 21:55.570
I have learned what the greatest
grace God grants to people is.

21:57.736 --> 22:00.036
I've just found out it now, Mother Hayme.

22:00.970 --> 22:01.970
I've just found out!

22:05.103 --> 22:09.503
It is to be buried by his own children.

22:12.136 --> 22:17.570
But it's my destiny
to bury my own children.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.870
After my sons,

22:27.236 --> 22:29.603
now I'm burying my own daughter.

22:37.536 --> 22:44.470
We have traveled all these lands and we
lost a life on each land we stepped on.

22:47.203 --> 22:48.903
My heart says,

22:51.003 --> 22:56.636
these lands which we lost lives
and shed our blood on

22:58.536 --> 23:00.803
will be the home to our future
generation.

23:04.870 --> 23:08.670
We have seen winter, Master Demir.

23:09.603 --> 23:12.170
Our generation will see the spring.

23:16.170 --> 23:17.870
You are right, Mother Hayme.

23:20.203 --> 23:21.736
You are right;

23:22.970 --> 23:27.270
however I have buried
myself alive into a hole.

23:29.203 --> 23:33.836
Unless death takes me,
I will not get out of this hole.

23:38.270 --> 23:40.803
What other problems
can I have, Mother Hayme?

23:42.570 --> 23:47.070
I buried my two sons and one daughter.

23:48.836 --> 23:53.070
What about your problems?
What about your pain?

23:54.736 --> 23:57.836
How will you save our tribe
from this darkness

23:58.970 --> 24:01.170
which has fallen upon us,
Mother Hayme?

24:02.870 --> 24:04.703
While many people

24:06.170 --> 24:09.570
count on every word I say

24:12.670 --> 24:15.703
how I can mourn after my children,
Master Demir?

24:27.003 --> 24:28.736
I have buried my pain into my heart.

24:32.003 --> 24:38.003
As long as our people thrive,
I don't mind suffering.

24:53.503 --> 24:57.736
We have temporarily settled the
pregnant and elderly women in tents.

24:59.903 --> 25:02.603
What about our martyrs?

25:03.203 --> 25:07.136
The preparations for our martyrs' burial
place where the combat took place

25:07.236 --> 25:08.836
are about to be over, Bey.

25:09.536 --> 25:13.570
After funeral prayers,
we will bury our martyrs in the evening.

25:19.103 --> 25:21.503
Artuk, how are the injured?

25:22.770 --> 25:25.570
We've divided the prayer room
into two parts.

25:25.636 --> 25:28.003
We are treating women and men
there with midwives.

25:31.236 --> 25:33.936
Thank you. May you be blessed, Beys.

25:34.236 --> 25:37.170
As you know, we embraced our brothers,
the Kayi tribe.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.270
We have not abandoned them on the
mountains without food and water.

25:40.903 --> 25:42.270
We have dressed their wounds.

25:42.536 --> 25:45.536
What will we do, Bey?
How far will this continue?

25:47.103 --> 25:53.470
Our duty is to stand behind them.
We will help them and share their pain.

25:54.470 --> 26:00.870
The main issue is, what to do when the
Mongol dragon attack us with full force.

26:00.970 --> 26:03.903
Let's think about that.

26:25.603 --> 26:28.570
Sadettin Kobek
wanted you to know something, Bey.

26:28.970 --> 26:32.503
When the spring comes, Sultan Aladdin
will gather all Oghuz tribes

26:32.603 --> 26:33.936
and attack you.

26:36.503 --> 26:38.770
Aladdin thinks he is cunning.

26:40.536 --> 26:41.703
The new world is ours, Karabey.

26:43.203 --> 26:46.003
After Genghis Khan's children
had brought China to its knees

26:46.103 --> 26:48.736
they will come to these lands, too.

27:49.036 --> 27:50.203
What happened, son?

27:52.203 --> 27:53.203
Mother

27:55.670 --> 27:56.670
Halime

28:00.536 --> 28:01.536
Forgive me.

28:05.670 --> 28:06.936
I was not able to bring
my brother back to you.

28:42.570 --> 28:45.970
-Ertugrul has become a martyr.
-No!

28:57.003 --> 28:58.503
Halime, Halime!

29:02.870 --> 29:03.870
Halime!

29:43.003 --> 29:44.736
How did this happen, son?

29:47.136 --> 29:51.603
They burnt him, uncle.
They burnt all of them alive.

30:11.636 --> 30:12.636
Mother!

30:13.270 --> 30:14.270
Mother!

31:32.753 --> 31:35.986
Ertugrul will deal
the greatest blow to Sultan Aladdin.

31:36.886 --> 31:41.320
-How?
-If Ertugrul chooses to obey me

31:41.586 --> 31:44.153
he will become the ruler of Anatolia.

31:45.253 --> 31:47.520
However, his leash will be in my hands.

31:48.220 --> 31:50.120
And we will bring Aladdin to his knees.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.820
Noyan, they brought Ertugrul.

33:31.686 --> 33:32.753
Tie him up.

33:34.586 --> 33:36.986
Get this girl ready for Noyan. Hurry up!

34:19.920 --> 34:21.586
My condolences, Mother Hayme.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.520
My condolences, Mother Hayme.

34:28.253 --> 34:29.286
My condolences, Mother Hayme.

34:51.020 --> 34:52.520
My condolences, Halime.

34:58.553 --> 34:59.720
My condolences, Baci Hayme.

35:12.753 --> 35:14.686
Before he embarked on his expedition,
I told my man that

35:16.720 --> 35:21.986
may no stone touch his feet,
may no wind hurt his body.

35:27.853 --> 35:32.120
However, I was told that even if
no stone touched him, no wind hurt him

35:32.220 --> 35:34.320
they still burnt him alive.

35:46.886 --> 35:51.253
None of us can be at peace
unless we avenge Ertuğrul.

35:55.686 --> 35:56.953
Rest assured, daughter.

35:58.820 --> 36:02.620
He is not only my sister Hayme's son.

36:04.836 --> 36:07.003
Ertugrul was my son, too.

36:08.336 --> 36:11.236
If I do not avenge him,

36:13.270 --> 36:16.203
I cannot live with this shame.

37:30.203 --> 37:31.270
Do not be scared.

37:33.103 --> 37:34.970
Fear does not look good on
your beautiful eyes.

38:45.770 --> 38:49.770
If you want that girl to live,
do not cause any trouble during dinner.

38:50.970 --> 38:53.436
If Noyan vents his anger on her,
you will be sorry for that.

41:20.870 --> 41:22.336
Welcome to my shrine, Ertugrul.

41:35.770 --> 41:36.770
Enjoy your meal!

41:59.336 --> 42:01.770
So you are the gallant man who
defeated the Templars,

42:02.503 --> 42:05.536
became friends with
the Ameer of Aleppo, Al Aziz,

42:06.303 --> 42:10.103
have bonds with Seljuk Empire
through marriage

42:10.870 --> 42:16.503
and who spilled my brave warriors'
blood mercilessly.

42:19.170 --> 42:24.470
So you are the ignoble man who rapes
women, kills babies in their cradle

42:25.870 --> 42:27.803
and boasts about it.

42:33.570 --> 42:37.870
You are right, Ertugrul.
We are the fire of the moor.

42:39.336 --> 42:42.203
Once the moor catches fire,
it burns for days.

42:43.303 --> 42:45.470
It throws the baby
out with the bathwater.

42:47.170 --> 42:50.236
We are establishing the biggest state
the world has seen.

42:52.403 --> 42:55.070
Genghis Khan conquered half of the
world.

42:56.036 --> 42:57.836
We will conquer the rest.

42:59.303 --> 43:04.836
What is a few corpses in such
a sacred cause?

43:07.170 --> 43:12.070
Your empire is like a fruitless tree.
You will be chopped down.

43:14.036 --> 43:17.170
The sun will blight you
and you will disappear.

43:18.370 --> 43:20.570
People will only remember your cruelty.

43:22.203 --> 43:26.203
And then the state you had founded
will attack here and there

43:26.303 --> 43:30.036
and bite itself just like rabid dogs.

43:40.236 --> 43:42.836
I hope that your Mother Hayme,

43:42.936 --> 43:46.303
your bother Gundogdu
and your wife Halime

43:46.403 --> 43:50.103
will not be amongst the ones those
rabid dogs attacked.

43:52.503 --> 43:55.436
You have chosen a
warrior wife just like yourself.

43:56.836 --> 44:00.370
We found out that she escaped us and
took shelter in Korkut's nomad tent.

44:02.170 --> 44:03.536
But it does not matter.

44:05.236 --> 44:09.836
Halime Sultan from the Seljuk Empire
will live just a few more days.

44:12.103 --> 44:13.970
If she is lucky, a few more winters.

44:15.803 --> 44:21.903
If you are our enemy, she'll be a victim
of this cruel war sooner or later.

44:23.870 --> 44:26.803
Your wife and all your beloved ones.

44:29.303 --> 44:32.036
-My condolences, Bey.
-My condolences.

45:08.770 --> 45:09.770
Here.

45:17.970 --> 45:20.403
This sword is your child's now.

46:07.270 --> 46:08.270
God!

46:38.336 --> 46:39.403
Halime!

46:42.070 --> 46:43.103
Bring some water!

46:46.236 --> 46:47.236
Dear daughter!

46:49.570 --> 46:50.570
Halime!

47:11.903 --> 47:15.703
If god permits, this sword will become
the voice and wrath of injustice

47:15.803 --> 47:17.470
in your hands.

47:20.936 --> 47:22.236
God bless.

47:30.303 --> 47:33.936
Come to the point. Why did you not kill
me when you had the chance?

47:35.536 --> 47:36.670
What do you want from me?

47:40.270 --> 47:46.170
A strong warrior like yourself is more
valuable to me alive than dead, Ertugrul.

47:47.270 --> 47:49.903
I can only be your angel of death,
Noyan.

48:18.303 --> 48:23.870
For your mother, wife, and the children
in your nomad group

48:23.970 --> 48:27.670
to be able to live at peace and serenity

48:29.870 --> 48:34.403
I want you to see the truth and be
on our side, Ertuğrul.

48:45.470 --> 48:49.470
Be with us, walk with us. Win with us.

48:51.370 --> 48:54.870
Fighting dastardly and killing babies
is not something to be proud of.

48:54.970 --> 48:56.870
But something to be ashamed of, Noyan.

49:00.636 --> 49:02.903
We live for our honor.

49:08.836 --> 49:12.270
We found out how you caused trouble
for the crusaders.

49:12.936 --> 49:14.503
We know you well enough, Ertugrul.

49:16.236 --> 49:19.170
Sultan Aladdin
will certainly die quite soon.

49:20.436 --> 49:22.870
Then you all will be
left out in the cold.

49:24.670 --> 49:29.436
I'm giving you a chance to protect
your nomad group and the loved ones.

49:31.636 --> 49:35.436
You either take our ide and become
our friends

49:36.703 --> 49:40.936
or perish just like all our enemies.

49:44.470 --> 49:46.236
Do not rush to respond to my offer.

49:47.403 --> 49:51.470
First, enjoy this food and wine,

49:51.803 --> 49:53.936
then we will talk at length.

49:54.736 --> 49:57.303
We have been fighting the armies of
Genghis Khan since I was born.

49:58.836 --> 50:00.836
My beloved ones died one by one.

50:02.236 --> 50:03.903
Including my brother, Sungur Tekin.

50:07.703 --> 50:09.803
Now you are talking about friendship.

50:12.636 --> 50:16.536
As long as I live, we will never
become friends.

50:18.236 --> 50:19.536
Sungur Tekin...

50:22.736 --> 50:26.870
He is one of the finest and
smartest warriors I have ever seen.

50:29.736 --> 50:33.503
He proved that by becoming one of us.

50:35.403 --> 50:40.370
Now he is fighting by Ogeday's side and
proving everyone how courageous he is.

50:42.470 --> 50:46.603
You are both a vile warrior
and a vile liar.

50:51.903 --> 50:54.836
You will see whether if
I am lying or not soon enough, Ertugrul.

50:57.403 --> 51:00.403
Sungur Tekin will come here in spring
with the Mongol troops.

51:06.270 --> 51:09.170
Now, go and think about
what I have said.

51:24.270 --> 51:27.870
If you want me to believe that
you still have a hint of humanity

51:31.370 --> 51:33.503
let the girl stay with me.

54:29.970 --> 54:33.203
Enough! Stop beating him!

55:25.127 --> 55:27.207
My heart tells me you did not die,
Ertugrul.

55:33.327 --> 55:36.727
It tells me that you did not leave me
alone with our child in this world.

55:45.047 --> 55:46.847
Please, be alive.

55:48.807 --> 55:51.727
Please, do not leave me alone
with our child.

56:09.807 --> 56:12.327
Cry, my daughter. Cry.

56:15.447 --> 56:17.687
Mother, may Ertugrul be alive.

56:19.327 --> 56:21.647
May he not have left us alone.

57:00.447 --> 57:01.687
So, you still show resistance.

57:03.247 --> 57:06.167
Let us see how persevering you are.

57:20.727 --> 57:25.127
Ertuğrul wishes to have fun.
So let the fun begin.

57:48.567 --> 57:53.527
The Kayi tribe without Ertugrul
is like a crippled person, Hatun.

57:55.007 --> 58:00.007
I was the mind of this tribe.
And he was the heart.

58:06.087 --> 58:07.887
He got into hot water.

58:10.167 --> 58:13.287
However, he managed to overcome
all troubles.

58:17.567 --> 58:19.967
I thought he would come back
this time, too.

58:22.167 --> 58:24.607
I thought no trouble could come to him.

58:27.287 --> 58:31.607
However, my brother is gone
for sure, this time.

58:41.607 --> 58:42.687
For this reason,

58:45.447 --> 58:49.647
his child is our child now, Hatun.

58:52.247 --> 58:54.047
You shall take care of Halime.

58:56.607 --> 58:58.207
Not to worry, Bey.

59:04.727 --> 59:07.047
Bey Ertugrul has become a martyr.

59:08.087 --> 59:10.287
He was bestowed the most
honorable of deaths.

59:13.647 --> 59:16.207
The Kayi tribe should recover as soon as
possible.

59:17.407 --> 59:19.567
Everyone is suffering in their tents.

59:22.607 --> 59:26.447
If you do not exercise sovereignty,
everyone will be scattered.

59:29.447 --> 59:32.727
We want two nomad tents to unite.

59:34.447 --> 59:37.447
This way, we can find relief
for a few springs.

59:38.007 --> 59:40.007
There is no other way for now.

59:41.887 --> 59:45.247
However, being united has its
own problems.

59:47.007 --> 59:48.007
Such as?

59:50.767 --> 59:53.647
The Dudurga nomad group is without a Bey.

59:55.367 --> 59:59.047
Bey Korkut is infatuated with Aytolun
in his old age.

01:00:02.527 --> 01:00:05.487
Aytolun wants to reign the marquee.

01:00:07.607 --> 01:00:10.047
Even if she's on bad terms with Tugtekin

01:00:10.247 --> 01:00:13.047
she is sure to have him
under her spell soon, too.

01:00:15.127 --> 01:00:20.287
God, Hatun while we are suffering,
how could you see all this?

01:00:23.527 --> 01:00:24.967
I'm just saying, Bey.

01:00:27.567 --> 01:00:29.687
You should know your allies well

01:00:30.887 --> 01:00:34.687
so that they won't become your enemies
when it's time to break things off.

01:03:29.187 --> 01:03:30.667
You are after the wrong man, Noyan.

01:03:32.587 --> 01:03:34.027
You can never persuade him.

01:03:34.587 --> 01:03:35.947
End this match!

01:04:44.827 --> 01:04:47.267
Tie him up! I said tie him up!

01:05:27.867 --> 01:05:29.787
Hayme Baci has been overwhelmed
by circumstances.

01:05:31.147 --> 01:05:35.027
Moreover, the death of Ertugrul
has increased her pain.

01:05:38.947 --> 01:05:40.747
Didn't you use to say that we

01:05:41.907 --> 01:05:44.827
nomadic Turkmens carry
our pains on our horses

01:05:44.947 --> 01:05:46.587
along with ourselves, Father?

01:05:47.187 --> 01:05:49.347
I was ruined with the death of my mother.

01:05:51.187 --> 01:05:52.987
And we still couldn't manage
to find her killer.

01:05:54.627 --> 01:05:59.027
But if I do not kill her murderer
a thousand times I will live in shame.

01:06:01.027 --> 01:06:02.027
God!

01:06:07.907 --> 01:06:09.627
Come, Hatun, sit down.

01:06:13.467 --> 01:06:14.947
I think you do not need to do these
things anymore.

01:06:15.947 --> 01:06:19.667
-Find a helper for yourself.
-Thank you, Bey.

01:06:20.027 --> 01:06:21.707
I have been thinking about it
for a long time.

01:06:22.307 --> 01:06:25.627
Sewing workshop in the morning,
and marquee's work in the evening

01:06:25.747 --> 01:06:26.747
I get exhausted.

01:06:29.627 --> 01:06:31.147
Bismillah.

01:06:38.867 --> 01:06:39.867
Please.

01:06:49.387 --> 01:06:52.067
Father, what will your decision be
at the headquarters tomorrow?

01:06:53.747 --> 01:06:55.467
I am thinking that two nomad tents
should be united.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:07:00.507
-How will things proceed?
-The Kayi tribe can rule the Alps.

01:07:01.107 --> 01:07:03.427
The Alps even fought with the Mongols.

01:07:04.267 --> 01:07:06.987
And our Beys can take care of the rest.

01:07:10.347 --> 01:07:11.347
Alright.

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:20.107
My deceased mother used to say that

01:07:24.147 --> 01:07:28.947
if you need to make a decision always
consider the difficult days first.

01:07:32.227 --> 01:07:34.547
It is not my business to
interfere with men's matters.

01:07:35.747 --> 01:07:40.067
However, if there is unrest between
the two nomad tents

01:07:41.067 --> 01:07:44.387
just keep in mind that
the one who holds the Alps' power,

01:07:44.507 --> 01:07:46.667
will seize the power.

01:07:49.467 --> 01:07:50.467
What do you mean?

01:07:52.507 --> 01:07:56.587
I mean you should be the head of the Alps.

01:07:57.307 --> 01:07:58.947
You should be the one ruling them.

01:08:00.307 --> 01:08:04.267
So that when there is unrest,
we won't get into trouble.

01:08:04.387 --> 01:08:07.067
I've brought you some milk, son.
Do drink it as you wish.

01:09:18.147 --> 01:09:23.387
I am going to tell you
the story of Fil Surah, son.

01:09:24.347 --> 01:09:28.747
It's the Surah that tells how little
birds defeated giant elephants.

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:35.147
Once upon a time, Abraha the Cruel

01:09:35.267 --> 01:09:40.867
created an army made
of elephants to destroy Mecca.

01:09:43.427 --> 01:09:46.147
When Abraha took to the road

01:09:46.267 --> 01:09:50.427
all the people of Mecca ran
away for the mountains.

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:58.267
While Abraha was marching
towards Mecca with his huge troops

01:09:58.387 --> 01:10:02.747
suddenly, swifts appeared in the sky.

01:10:05.467 --> 01:10:08.667
It was actually a war
between birds and elephants.

01:10:10.747 --> 01:10:12.267
It was a war between
heretics and believers.

01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:20.547
The birds defeated Abraha's army
by dropping stones

01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:23.027
from their beaks upon them.

01:10:24.907 --> 01:10:28.387
Whenever you feel little and weak

01:10:28.507 --> 01:10:32.107
like those birds remember this Surah.

01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:36.267
It's not always
the big and the strong who win.

01:10:36.547 --> 01:10:38.867
God's will decides who will be victorious.

01:10:46.867 --> 01:10:48.787
May God be with you.

01:11:20.187 --> 01:11:21.467
Thank God.

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:44.307
In which flames did they throw
my great-hearted man

01:11:44.427 --> 01:11:45.747
and turn him to ashes?

01:11:51.747 --> 01:11:54.027
Not even the sun was supposed to burn him.

01:11:56.307 --> 01:11:58.827
Not even the wind
was supposed to make him cold.

01:12:02.067 --> 01:12:04.707
He would go,
but he would always come back.

01:12:17.587 --> 01:12:19.707
Did death do us part, Aktolgali?

01:12:30.827 --> 01:12:33.827
Ertugrul became a martyr before
he could see his child.

01:12:34.867 --> 01:12:37.107
It feels as if the blue sky has collapsed.

01:12:40.907 --> 01:12:42.587
The brave earth is pierced.

01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:47.347
The swords of the Kayi tribe
will rust in their sheaths.

01:12:50.187 --> 01:12:52.827
Neither the hunting nor the headquarters
will have an owner.

01:13:09.987 --> 01:13:12.147
He would not have left us, Aktolgali.

01:13:16.547 --> 01:13:18.867
And it would not suit us to leave him.

01:13:21.587 --> 01:13:26.027
From now on, breathing
is like living in hell to me.

01:13:33.387 --> 01:13:35.147
Do not say that, Halime.

01:13:36.747 --> 01:13:38.907
It's God's will.

01:13:39.627 --> 01:13:40.787
We are mortal servants.

01:13:43.347 --> 01:13:45.627
May God unite you in his heaven.

01:13:50.187 --> 01:13:52.267
Will we unite in heaven, Selcan Hatun?

01:13:54.867 --> 01:13:57.787
If God permits, Halime Sultan.

01:14:16.987 --> 01:14:17.987
How is Halime?

01:14:21.187 --> 01:14:24.107
Halime will never be able to find
happiness in her heart again, brother.

01:14:26.147 --> 01:14:28.227
Hopefully, she will recover soon.

01:14:31.947 --> 01:14:33.427
And how are you, Hayme?

01:14:38.267 --> 01:14:41.827
Not a teardrop, nor a day of mourning.

01:14:42.787 --> 01:14:44.547
Until my nomad tent finds peace,

01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:47.227
I shall bury my sorrow in those mountains.

01:14:50.267 --> 01:14:54.187
Fortunately, Yigit and Dundar
are not here to see our pain.

01:14:57.147 --> 01:14:58.187
What do your Beys say?

01:15:00.107 --> 01:15:02.187
I told them you invited them
to the headquarters.

01:15:02.307 --> 01:15:05.907
-They said they will come gladly.
-Thank you.

01:15:08.627 --> 01:15:09.787
What are you thinking, brother?

01:15:10.027 --> 01:15:12.587
They attacked my nomad tent
last summer, Hayme.

01:15:13.547 --> 01:15:14.707
We had many casualties.

01:15:15.987 --> 01:15:20.747
They took half of the herd, too.
They broke our wings.

01:15:20.867 --> 01:15:24.307
They broke our wings, too.
To hell with them!

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:27.947
This winter will be difficult for
both of us, Hayme.

01:15:28.787 --> 01:15:31.107
Is this why you invited us to the
headquarters as a guest?

01:15:33.747 --> 01:15:34.747
Not just as a guest.

01:15:36.667 --> 01:15:38.147
I'd like to unite the two nomad tents.

01:15:39.987 --> 01:15:44.667
If the Mongols do not eradicate us,
it will be our last winter on these lands.

01:15:46.907 --> 01:15:50.267
I want two nomad tents to be one

01:15:50.387 --> 01:15:52.867
so that we can survive
this winter even if it will be difficult

01:15:54.187 --> 01:15:56.427
You will be a cure for the Kayi tribe
with these words, brother.

01:15:57.267 --> 01:16:02.947
However, what would the poor and
the injured in your nomad tent say?

01:16:03.827 --> 01:16:05.227
Winter is coming.

01:16:06.267 --> 01:16:11.107
And we do not have anything else
except our pain to share with you.

01:16:14.627 --> 01:16:16.947
You have the best Alps of the Oghuz tribe.

01:16:18.147 --> 01:16:21.667
That is enough to help us.

01:16:22.987 --> 01:16:26.027
I will talk about it at the headquarters.
I wanted you to know that.

01:16:27.747 --> 01:16:30.987
Thank you, brother. If it was meant to be.

01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:36.427
Incompetent man!

01:16:36.547 --> 01:16:38.147
My horse became crippled because of you!

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:41.507
I am not a blacksmith, Bey.

01:16:43.027 --> 01:16:45.747
I did my best. Forgive me, Bey.

01:16:47.067 --> 01:16:48.067
Bey!

01:16:51.547 --> 01:16:52.587
Poor man begged forgiveness.

01:16:56.107 --> 01:16:58.747
And he was given
a task that is not his duty.

01:17:01.107 --> 01:17:02.307
Know your place, Alp Dogan!

01:17:03.907 --> 01:17:06.907
The ones who are in the wrong are
punished right away in this nomad group.

01:17:07.627 --> 01:17:09.147
Otherwise problems will come
one after another.

01:17:13.387 --> 01:17:17.507
We know our place from mores,
and get appreciation from our Bey.

01:17:19.827 --> 01:17:20.827
Dogan?

01:17:22.827 --> 01:17:23.827
What is it?

01:17:25.347 --> 01:17:28.107
We are talking about Oghuz mores
with Bey Tugtekin.

01:17:30.347 --> 01:17:34.707
Their deceased Bey Ertugrul
could not teach them manners.

01:17:38.027 --> 01:17:39.227
We are in pain.

01:17:41.307 --> 01:17:43.907
I don't want to be troubled with
your bickering.

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:49.947
You are right, Brother Gundogdu;
however, they do not know their place.

01:17:53.907 --> 01:17:57.427
Anyway, we need to go
to get prepared for the headquarters.

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:14.507
You do not have your Bey now,
Brother Dogan.

01:18:15.667 --> 01:18:19.907
Do not shit where you eat.
You will pay a heavy price.

01:18:28.227 --> 01:18:30.667
We have no price left unpaid, Kocabash.

01:18:34.227 --> 01:18:36.427
If the need arises,
we will pay for it, too.

01:20:38.987 --> 01:20:41.187
Today I nailed the hand you swing
your sword with.

01:20:42.957 --> 01:20:47.277
Tomorrow I will nail the other hand.
Then your feet.

01:20:48.717 --> 01:20:52.677
Then finally, I will nail your eyes with
my own hands.

01:20:54.637 --> 01:20:58.437
This torture will not end until you
decide to obey me.

01:21:24.557 --> 01:21:26.917
What happened? What does Tugtekin
say about his father's speech?

01:21:27.397 --> 01:21:30.917
He agrees with his father, mother.
He wants to be united.

01:21:31.877 --> 01:21:36.117
-How about the other Beys?
-We will find out at the headquarters.

01:21:38.437 --> 01:21:39.717
What do you think?

01:21:42.757 --> 01:21:45.917
My words are not respected
in the Kayi tribe, mother.

01:21:47.837 --> 01:21:48.917
Is that wrong?

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:53.557
I remember telling you not to go to
Aleppo, but you did not listen to me.

01:21:54.477 --> 01:21:56.317
We got into hot water.

01:21:56.717 --> 01:22:01.877
Right when we found peace,
we set off again. I did not approve it.

01:22:02.157 --> 01:22:04.077
And we got into hot water again.

01:22:04.797 --> 01:22:06.957
From now on, people
will learn to mind my words.

01:22:08.477 --> 01:22:12.197
As for your question, I'd like the two
nomad groups to be united.

01:22:12.477 --> 01:22:15.077
Otherwise we will fall prey to
our enemies this winter.

01:22:16.357 --> 01:22:19.717
Also, we shall avenge
those infidel Mongols.

01:22:20.677 --> 01:22:23.037
Or the pain of the people
will not be soothed.

01:22:23.877 --> 01:22:27.477
And it is our duty to easy their pain.

01:22:28.157 --> 01:22:29.197
Excuse me, mother.

01:22:35.597 --> 01:22:37.837
Selcan, come, daughter.

01:22:39.317 --> 01:22:40.317
Yes, mother?

01:22:40.717 --> 01:22:44.157
Daughter, until the conditions
are clearer, our Hatuns who work

01:22:44.277 --> 01:22:46.917
at the sewing workshop
will help Aytolun's women.

01:22:48.077 --> 01:22:49.517
We've already placed a strain upon them.

01:22:49.637 --> 01:22:51.517
It's best if we make ourselves useful.

01:22:52.477 --> 01:22:55.637
Alright, mother. I will talk to our women
and do what is necessary.

01:22:57.237 --> 01:22:58.557
Choose the best ones.

01:23:00.157 --> 01:23:02.397
Leave whoever lost their beloved ones
at the battle alone.

01:23:02.597 --> 01:23:04.197
Allow them to mourn.

01:23:04.677 --> 01:23:06.917
We do not have
the right to do such a thing.

01:23:07.717 --> 01:23:10.637
The best thing we can do is
let them mourn. Alright?

01:24:38.317 --> 01:24:40.077
My condolences, Gokche Hatun.

01:24:41.677 --> 01:24:43.957
May God give you a long life,
Bey Tugtekin.

01:24:54.997 --> 01:24:57.437
I know well what it means to lose
a brother.

01:25:02.837 --> 01:25:04.837
Two of my brothers died in my arms.

01:25:14.837 --> 01:25:15.837
Ertugrul

01:25:18.517 --> 01:25:20.397
he was more than a brother to me.

01:25:28.597 --> 01:25:30.117
I do not know if it consoles you,

01:25:32.197 --> 01:25:37.757
but whoever did this to Ertuğrul,
will pay for it, Gokche Hatun.

01:26:05.637 --> 01:26:08.557
You must discourage the Turkmens
before winter comes, Noyan.

01:26:08.837 --> 01:26:11.117
If Sultan Alaaddin takes this herd of
shepherds after him

01:26:11.237 --> 01:26:14.117
and comes onto you before Ogeday
finishes his campaign to China,

01:26:14.557 --> 01:26:15.957
you will be the ones crushed this time.

01:26:17.757 --> 01:26:19.237
Not to worry, Karabek.

01:26:20.357 --> 01:26:23.357
They will experience the most difficult
winter of their lives.

01:26:24.557 --> 01:26:26.997
They will see that
they cannot take shelter in their tents

01:26:27.117 --> 01:26:29.437
and live in peace as if
they were in their mothers' wombs.

01:26:31.957 --> 01:26:34.357
When are you planning to set up a
meeting for me and Saadettin Kobek?

01:26:34.877 --> 01:26:36.597
It depends on your generosity.

01:26:41.437 --> 01:26:44.277
We Mongols are generous, Karabek.

01:27:07.757 --> 01:27:12.397
Saadettin Kobek is ready to meet you.
The two of you will meet tomorrow.

01:27:13.997 --> 01:27:18.117
-This quick?
-He's expecting you at the Sultan Inn.

01:27:20.037 --> 01:27:22.037
So he's expecting me at the Sultan Inn?

01:27:25.637 --> 01:27:30.717
Karabek, if you trick me
I will skin you alive.

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:39.277
Is that all? I was expecting more women.

01:27:43.797 --> 01:27:47.997
Most of them lost their Beys or sons,
Aytolun, but they are the best.

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:51.637
Your work benches will be busy
night and day.

01:27:52.597 --> 01:27:55.397
You can bring the goods to towns
and sell them before winter comes.

01:27:56.597 --> 01:27:59.317
As long as they are not under
my women's feet...

01:28:07.317 --> 01:28:12.917
I know that you are all suffering.
You have been through hard times.

01:28:13.597 --> 01:28:16.397
However, we are all in a great war.

01:28:17.597 --> 01:28:21.357
Our Beys are talking about
our future in the marquee.

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:26.637
And we need to satisfy
the needs of our nomad tent.

01:28:27.157 --> 01:28:29.917
Before winter comes,
we must manufacture enough goods

01:28:30.037 --> 01:28:32.517
for the markets
in Erzurum, Konya, Diyarbakir.

01:28:33.117 --> 01:28:36.637
Our duty is as important as that of our
combating Alps.

01:28:37.157 --> 01:28:38.317
We cannot stop.

01:28:38.917 --> 01:28:41.997
We cannot regard it as a burden.
We will only do our duty.

01:28:43.077 --> 01:28:45.397
Before winter comes,
we must complete our work.

01:28:47.397 --> 01:28:53.597
Until your condition is clearer you will
help my women at the sewing workshop.

01:28:56.117 --> 01:28:57.197
Am I right, Selcan Hatun?

01:29:00.117 --> 01:29:01.557
You are right, Aytolun Hatun.

01:29:02.717 --> 01:29:06.597
Our women will do their duty properly.
Not to worry.

01:29:06.997 --> 01:29:08.357
If God permits.

01:29:10.437 --> 01:29:13.477
Alright. Say "bismillah" and begin.

01:29:15.597 --> 01:29:16.597
Go ahead, women.

01:29:23.397 --> 01:29:26.117
Go there and help her.

01:29:36.197 --> 01:29:39.317
Welcome, Hayme Baci. Welcome. Please.

01:30:40.157 --> 01:30:42.277
In the 99 names of God

01:30:42.917 --> 01:30:48.117
who created us with his one word
and who fills our heart with faith.

01:30:49.037 --> 01:30:50.197
Bismillah.

01:30:52.037 --> 01:30:53.357
Have your say, Hayme.

01:31:09.957 --> 01:31:10.957
Mother?

01:31:12.797 --> 01:31:13.797
Mother?

01:31:15.837 --> 01:31:19.997
Uncle asked you to be the first to talk

01:31:20.117 --> 01:31:22.077
about the union of the two nomad groups.

01:31:28.077 --> 01:31:29.957
First of all,

01:31:30.077 --> 01:31:33.837
you opened your marquee
and your hearts to us.

01:31:34.597 --> 01:31:35.757
May God bless you.

01:31:40.357 --> 01:31:43.117
They say each day has a night.

01:31:43.237 --> 01:31:46.597
Time flies. We know our enemy.

01:31:48.397 --> 01:31:51.917
That is why being united is best.

01:31:54.797 --> 01:31:57.477
I say, let us be one!

01:31:58.277 --> 01:32:00.997
Be huge! Be strong!

01:32:04.917 --> 01:32:06.317
Thank you, Hayme Baci.

01:32:11.277 --> 01:32:14.597
If two nomad groups unite,

01:32:14.717 --> 01:32:18.637
it will be easier for us
to stand against the Mogul invasions.

01:32:20.957 --> 01:32:25.597
If God permits, Sultan Aladdin's army
will be here after this winter.

01:32:26.757 --> 01:32:30.717
However, we need to survive
until that time.

01:32:31.677 --> 01:32:35.917
Union is strength; however
how will this nomad group be governed?

01:32:36.557 --> 01:32:38.517
How will we share the tasks?

01:32:38.877 --> 01:32:43.277
What does the Kayi tribe promise us
provided that we are united?

01:32:47.037 --> 01:32:48.917
Not to worry.

01:32:49.517 --> 01:32:52.237
We do not intend to be
a burden on the Dodurga tribe.

01:32:53.797 --> 01:32:57.477
As you know our sewing workshop
burned down.

01:32:57.597 --> 01:33:02.957
But our dexterous women
will surely build new ones.

01:33:05.917 --> 01:33:11.917
And as for the goods in our hands,
we intend to sell them to buy provisions.

01:33:16.077 --> 01:33:20.517
The nomad group's governing
headquarters will gather at my marquee.

01:33:24.317 --> 01:33:31.317
But both nomad groups will settle their
own matters at their own headquarters.

01:33:33.557 --> 01:33:36.237
It is true, Bey. The alternative is
out of the question.

01:33:36.357 --> 01:33:39.077
-It is true.
-Is that alright, Hayme?

01:33:41.517 --> 01:33:42.717
It is, Bey.

01:33:45.637 --> 01:33:50.477
I suggest that my son Tuğtekin takes
command of the Alps.

01:33:57.557 --> 01:33:58.557
Is that alright?

01:33:59.317 --> 01:34:04.237
It seems you've made all decisions
beforehand, Bey Korkut.

01:34:09.397 --> 01:34:11.237
And we shall agree with them.

01:34:14.757 --> 01:34:18.757
And it seems that Wild Demir
underestimates my Alp skills.

01:34:20.117 --> 01:34:22.797
How can you command them if you
don't have any Alps amongst you?

01:34:33.877 --> 01:34:38.757
Shall we start worrying about
the seigniory before we avenge

01:34:38.917 --> 01:34:42.197
the blood shed for our brotherhood
to become stronger?

01:34:45.357 --> 01:34:49.397
Let us not have a battle of words on the
first meeting at the headquarters.

01:34:52.917 --> 01:34:54.837
Gundogdu is right.

01:34:57.477 --> 01:35:00.277
Let us not squabble.

01:35:02.317 --> 01:35:05.077
Let us not interpret
one another's intentions.

01:35:08.157 --> 01:35:13.757
We approve of Tugtekin becoming
head of the Alps.

01:35:21.237 --> 01:35:23.877
Gallant Gundogdu from the Kayi tribe

01:35:24.757 --> 01:35:29.317
shall proceed with his duty for his nomad
group in our nomad group, too.

01:35:29.437 --> 01:35:31.557
-Is that alright?
-It is.

01:35:41.997 --> 01:35:42.997
Thank you.

01:35:43.797 --> 01:35:49.317
Now, it is time to take our revenge.

01:35:51.157 --> 01:35:54.757
It is time to show that herd of dogs
who we are.

01:35:55.597 --> 01:35:57.837
Let us make the sun our spear,
and make the sky our tent

01:35:57.957 --> 01:35:59.397
and attack the Mongols.

01:36:11.597 --> 01:36:15.997
That will be the sign of our union.

01:36:16.477 --> 01:36:17.477
Thank you, Bey.

01:36:29.997 --> 01:36:34.637
-May God bless the Beys of Dodurga.
-Thank you.

01:36:36.237 --> 01:36:39.757
If anyone of you has something to say,
speak now.

01:36:44.277 --> 01:36:49.597
Because we are on a road of no return.
Keep that in mind.

01:36:50.877 --> 01:36:52.197
-Anyone?
-No, Bey.

01:36:52.317 --> 01:36:54.797
-No, Bey.
-No, Mother Hayme.

01:36:55.117 --> 01:36:57.997
-May God bless the holy war of our Alps.
-Amen.

01:37:02.797 --> 01:37:04.597
-May our union be blessed.
-Amen.

01:37:05.357 --> 01:37:07.037
-May all evils clear away.
-Amen.

01:37:07.597 --> 01:37:09.397
-May God bless us with luck.
-Amen.

01:37:10.077 --> 01:37:13.277
Now it is time to take revenge.

01:37:14.837 --> 01:37:17.637
Tugtekin, your duty awaits.

01:38:40.306 --> 01:38:41.706
You never give up, do you?

01:38:46.572 --> 01:38:48.839
Your brother Sungurtekin
was stubborn as you.

01:38:51.839 --> 01:38:53.872
But he finally realized that I am right.

01:38:57.872 --> 01:39:02.172
Now he is one of the
closest men to Ogeday.

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:05.839
You are lying.

01:39:08.206 --> 01:39:12.272
I told you, if you obey me,
I will bring him to you.

01:39:14.306 --> 01:39:17.639
You will hear yourself
if it is a lie or the truth.

01:39:20.539 --> 01:39:22.672
I will not be your dog, Noyan.

01:39:27.606 --> 01:39:28.606
It is a pity.

01:39:30.206 --> 01:39:33.572
It will sadden me quite much to lose
a precious warrior like you.

01:39:36.572 --> 01:39:39.339
My warriors are mad at me
for not killing you.

01:39:44.139 --> 01:39:45.406
If you be on my side

01:39:46.672 --> 01:39:48.706
the blood of Turks
will not be shed anymore.

01:39:52.606 --> 01:39:54.106
You can be sure of it.

01:39:56.906 --> 01:39:58.139
Noyan!

01:39:59.506 --> 01:40:03.872
Turks would go running to drink
the sherbet of martyrdom.

01:40:08.172 --> 01:40:09.539
My patience is running out.

01:40:12.406 --> 01:40:14.206
If you do not obey me

01:40:16.739 --> 01:40:18.439
I can surely find another traitor.

01:40:21.906 --> 01:40:23.139
It is your decision.

01:40:26.706 --> 01:40:27.872
I have a lot to do.

01:41:15.906 --> 01:41:18.406
I want to smash Kocabash's face in but...

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:20.272
Anyway.

01:41:31.539 --> 01:41:32.539
Brother Turgut.

01:41:34.172 --> 01:41:35.906
It is said that you attended
the headquarters, is it true?

01:41:38.206 --> 01:41:39.206
It is.

01:41:41.206 --> 01:41:43.306
Mother Hayme wanted me to attend
instead of Ertugrul Bey.

01:41:44.172 --> 01:41:46.239
What happened, brother?
What did you talk about there?

01:41:47.572 --> 01:41:48.672
Why did they gather us?

01:41:56.372 --> 01:41:57.439
You will find out now.

01:42:06.539 --> 01:42:12.306
The headquarters decided to take
my brother Ertugrul's revenge

01:42:12.506 --> 01:42:13.739
on that heathen Mongol.

01:42:15.472 --> 01:42:18.672
Whoever volunteers for this duty,
step forward.

01:42:26.839 --> 01:42:27.872
Thank you.

01:42:29.372 --> 01:42:31.506
But first, we need to find
the trace of Mongols.

01:42:32.906 --> 01:42:35.539
We are going to sent trackers
to all lands.

01:42:36.172 --> 01:42:38.572
Abdurrahman and Hamza will scout from us.

01:42:40.372 --> 01:42:44.172
And Bogac and Samsa from us.
Do not leave a stone unturned.

01:42:44.772 --> 01:42:46.439
You will trace and return.

01:42:46.906 --> 01:42:49.239
And here, we will prepare the Alps
who will take action.

01:42:50.539 --> 01:42:51.639
Go ahead, trot along.

01:43:21.906 --> 01:43:24.339
They are setting off to avenge Ertugrul.

01:43:29.539 --> 01:43:31.639
Something tells me Ertugrul
did not die, mother.

01:43:34.239 --> 01:43:36.472
As if he will come back to us, soon.

01:43:39.672 --> 01:43:42.106
As if he would not leave
his child fatherless.

01:44:15.272 --> 01:44:16.772
The two nomad tents decided
to take revenge.

01:44:18.439 --> 01:44:19.639
They are preparing to scout.

01:44:20.439 --> 01:44:21.739
We are going to cause them great distress.

01:44:23.639 --> 01:44:26.372
Look sharp. Do not lay bare.

01:44:29.806 --> 01:44:30.806
Do not worry about it.

01:45:51.872 --> 01:45:53.139
What is the matter with you?

01:45:53.539 --> 01:45:55.839
The nomad group talks about your bravery.

01:45:56.472 --> 01:45:59.206
But you are waiting here,
your face and heart in shadows.

01:46:00.139 --> 01:46:01.706
Tell me, what is wrong?

01:46:02.339 --> 01:46:03.339
Nothing.

01:46:06.672 --> 01:46:07.672
Come.

01:46:09.139 --> 01:46:11.872
Sit there. Something bothers you,
it is obvious.

01:46:12.906 --> 01:46:16.672
Tell me. There are two things which
bothers a gallant man like this.

01:46:17.606 --> 01:46:19.606
Either he has an enemy he cannot defeat

01:46:20.339 --> 01:46:24.172
or he is in love with
the most beautiful girl.

01:46:43.372 --> 01:46:45.872
-Is it that obvious?
-Is this girl Gokce?

01:46:48.572 --> 01:46:49.672
But how can you know?

01:46:50.839 --> 01:46:52.872
I saw how you looked at her on the bridge.

01:46:54.106 --> 01:46:57.506
By the grave of Aykiz.
At the funeral of Ertugrul.

01:47:00.839 --> 01:47:02.739
A fire fall to my heart
when she came to nomad tent.

01:47:05.606 --> 01:47:06.906
I could not stop thinking about her.

01:47:08.139 --> 01:47:10.806
Do you want to me to do a kindness
for you, sad lover?

01:47:12.139 --> 01:47:13.139
What?

01:47:13.339 --> 01:47:15.472
I can find out if she has a lover
or not, for you.

01:48:40.606 --> 01:48:41.706
Either you will move out

01:48:42.706 --> 01:48:44.139
or my hand will stay there.

01:49:41.339 --> 01:49:44.739
Tell me. Does Gokce has a lover?

01:49:48.206 --> 01:49:49.239
Tell me, Ilgish.

01:49:49.772 --> 01:49:52.872
Your mother brought me into the world.
She has many rights on me.

01:49:53.806 --> 01:49:55.606
If you know something,
do not hide from me.

01:49:55.872 --> 01:49:57.306
How could I, Aytolun Hatun?

01:49:58.272 --> 01:50:00.106
How I can hide something from you?

01:50:01.306 --> 01:50:02.739
Gokce is single.

01:50:03.606 --> 01:50:05.106
And she does not love anyone.

01:50:09.572 --> 01:50:12.639
Why no men has attended
to her all this time?

01:50:14.372 --> 01:50:17.472
Hanim, she is the daughter
of Suleyman Shah.

01:50:17.706 --> 01:50:18.806
It is not easy.

01:50:19.606 --> 01:50:21.372
She has two brave brothers.

01:50:22.672 --> 01:50:25.239
No man can dare to get near her.

01:50:26.206 --> 01:50:27.272
It takes a lot of nerve.

01:50:28.906 --> 01:50:30.572
And our daughter is a little coy.

01:50:40.872 --> 01:50:42.539
We embraced Kayi tribe.

01:50:45.306 --> 01:50:48.472
We did what would befit us, Aytolun Hatun.

01:50:50.372 --> 01:50:53.106
I hope they do not attempt to bite
the hands we held out.

01:50:53.772 --> 01:50:54.772
No.

01:50:56.106 --> 01:50:57.806
Kayis would rather pluck out their teeth

01:50:58.739 --> 01:51:02.272
than to bite the hands
reached out to them, Hanim.

01:51:04.172 --> 01:51:05.772
Hopefully, it is so, blacksmith.

01:51:06.606 --> 01:51:08.106
Hopefully, you are right.

01:51:21.639 --> 01:51:24.506
-You had summoned me, Artuk Bey.
-I would not summon, Wild Demir.

01:51:25.839 --> 01:51:27.806
Come with me, I will show you something.

01:51:46.472 --> 01:51:47.506
What did you find out?

01:51:49.806 --> 01:51:52.172
That she is a little coy.

01:51:53.272 --> 01:51:59.272
That men are afraid to come near her
and that she does not love anyone.

01:52:02.106 --> 01:52:03.439
She is in great sorrow.

01:52:05.106 --> 01:52:06.239
Treat her tactfully.

01:52:06.706 --> 01:52:08.339
And I will do what is necessary.

01:52:10.906 --> 01:52:12.372
How could I remunerate you?

01:52:13.439 --> 01:52:15.572
You can start by calling me mother.

01:52:19.172 --> 01:52:20.739
Come. Go ahead.

01:52:29.872 --> 01:52:32.372
Did you bring me here to show here?

01:52:34.506 --> 01:52:37.705
I thought your heart may be willing
if you saw the hearth that does not burn

01:52:38.439 --> 01:52:43.872
the hammer that does not meet the iron,
the steel that does not kiss the anvil.

01:52:49.839 --> 01:52:51.539
We need you, Wild Demir.

01:52:52.739 --> 01:52:54.739
Not only for you are a blacksmith.

01:52:55.606 --> 01:52:57.339
But for you are a warrior.

01:52:57.639 --> 01:53:00.139
For you are the finest warrior at that.

01:53:01.906 --> 01:53:06.839
You will make the swords which will
pluck ignoble Mongols' livers.

01:53:08.439 --> 01:53:10.706
I made many swords for many Alps, Bey.

01:53:12.406 --> 01:53:14.839
But I saw their delight did not last long.

01:53:17.139 --> 01:53:20.872
I saw my swords in their hands while
the light of their eyes were fading.

01:53:24.906 --> 01:53:30.906
Last, I made a sword for my daughter
before we left Aleppo.

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:34.439
So she could protect her honor and life.

01:53:37.106 --> 01:53:38.506
She fought like Alps.

01:53:40.372 --> 01:53:43.572
She hit, cut and beat them.

01:53:47.706 --> 01:53:49.539
But she could not survive
from burning, Bey.

01:53:52.139 --> 01:53:53.839
Now while all these are on my mind

01:53:56.139 --> 01:53:57.572
how do you expect me

01:54:01.506 --> 01:54:05.672
to put a sword between this hammer
and this anvil?

01:54:11.139 --> 01:54:12.472
How do you expect that, Artuk Bey?

01:55:38.539 --> 01:55:39.639
There you are, jackal!

01:55:41.172 --> 01:55:42.272
What will you tell us?

01:55:43.339 --> 01:55:44.639
What are you?

01:55:45.639 --> 01:55:48.372
Tell us, where is Noyan? Speak!

01:55:49.572 --> 01:55:51.472
Let us make this dog talk!

01:55:52.306 --> 01:55:53.306
Go ahead!

01:56:07.306 --> 01:56:09.539
Uncle, we know that they are watching us.

01:56:10.639 --> 01:56:12.372
But we wanted to make use
of this condition.

01:56:13.439 --> 01:56:16.739
We placed our best Alps
to every corner of nomad tent.

01:56:17.339 --> 01:56:18.639
They will lie in ambush and wait.

01:56:19.739 --> 01:56:21.239
Surely, we will catch one.

01:56:22.272 --> 01:56:26.572
Instead of looking for Noyan far away,
looking for him around the nomad tent?

01:56:27.772 --> 01:56:30.106
If we catch only one,
we will find out a lot.

01:56:30.572 --> 01:56:31.839
We sent news to four winds.

01:56:32.172 --> 01:56:34.139
We did not want to pursue him
before we found a trace.

01:56:35.372 --> 01:56:36.539
You thought right.

01:56:47.206 --> 01:56:48.639
-The dinner is ready.
-Alright, daughter.

01:56:55.206 --> 01:56:56.206
Please.

01:57:47.406 --> 01:57:48.572
<i>I hope you will like it.</i>

01:57:49.506 --> 01:57:52.572
<i>I have tried all day</i>
 <i>but this is all I could make.</i>

01:57:56.739 --> 01:57:58.139
<i>What happened, Turgut?</i>
 <i>-Bring water.</i>

01:58:04.806 --> 01:58:05.872
<i>What happened, do you not like it?</i>

01:58:06.472 --> 01:58:08.339
<i>Even those Templars did not</i>
 <i>torture me like this.</i>

01:58:09.472 --> 01:58:11.406
<i>The poison they gave me,</i>
 <i>is tastier than this.</i>

01:58:12.106 --> 01:58:14.506
<i>You think so? Go and drink</i>
 <i>their poison then.</i>

01:58:15.706 --> 01:58:17.139
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

01:58:17.472 --> 01:58:19.539
<i>Wait, sit down, I am kidding.</i>

01:58:23.239 --> 01:58:24.239
Turgut?

01:58:26.772 --> 01:58:27.772
Brother?

01:58:59.406 --> 01:59:00.872
In the name of God.

01:59:03.906 --> 01:59:05.472
In the name of God.

01:59:18.372 --> 01:59:19.372
Welcome, daughter.

01:59:20.872 --> 01:59:21.906
Please, sit there.

01:59:32.106 --> 01:59:33.906
We are glad to see you among us.

01:59:34.906 --> 01:59:38.906
You need to bury your pain inside
and be strong for your child, Halime.

01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:41.839
This is the destiny
for the wife of and Alp.

01:59:44.106 --> 01:59:46.506
We are glad to see you at our table.

01:59:49.772 --> 01:59:50.906
Ertugrul did not die.

02:00:01.539 --> 02:00:05.106
Ertugrul was the bravest Alp I knew.

02:00:10.872 --> 02:00:14.406
It is hard to accept the loss of
an Alp like him for all of us.

02:00:14.872 --> 02:00:17.872
But it is harder for you, daughter.

02:00:22.772 --> 02:00:23.772
Brother.

02:00:24.906 --> 02:00:30.806
We will put a plate for Ertugrul,
from now on as we do for Sungurtekin.

02:00:34.106 --> 02:00:37.606
Tomorrow, the marquee of Kayi tribe
will be established.

02:00:38.772 --> 02:00:42.872
Hopefully, we will see the owner
of those empty plates there.

02:00:48.206 --> 02:00:49.639
Please, enjoy your supper.

02:00:51.439 --> 02:00:52.639
<i>Bey, is there permission?</i>

02:00:53.872 --> 02:00:54.872
Come in.

02:01:03.706 --> 02:01:04.839
What happened, Abdurrahman?

02:01:06.272 --> 02:01:09.406
As Gundogdu Bey said, we went to the field
and lied in ambush, Mother Hayme.

02:01:10.206 --> 02:01:12.506
We saw a Mongol who was watching
the nomad tent.

02:01:12.839 --> 02:01:14.906
-Did you catch him?
-We did, Mother Hayme.

02:01:16.106 --> 02:01:17.772
-Did he speak?
-Before he died

02:01:18.706 --> 02:01:20.606
he said Noyan will set off tomorrow.

02:01:24.539 --> 02:01:25.639
Where he will go, too.

02:01:27.539 --> 02:01:30.106
Tugtekin, make the preparations.

02:03:01.606 --> 02:03:02.639
Halime!

02:03:03.606 --> 02:03:04.639
Halime!

02:03:27.506 --> 02:03:29.106
I know you are alive, Ertugrul.

02:03:32.772 --> 02:03:34.372
Until my breath drains away

02:03:35.339 --> 02:03:37.739
I will pray for you to be saved
from your suffer.

02:03:40.706 --> 02:03:42.372
For you to you reach your child.

02:03:52.472 --> 02:03:53.572
Your father will return, son.

02:03:54.839 --> 02:03:55.839
He will.

02:03:57.706 --> 02:03:59.106
Do not worry.

02:04:34.872 --> 02:04:36.272
May God keep your path bright.

02:04:38.206 --> 02:04:39.406
Thank you, Selcan Hatun.

02:04:41.872 --> 02:04:42.906
Gundogdu.

02:04:45.139 --> 02:04:46.572
I have an ill feeling inside me.

02:04:48.372 --> 02:04:49.506
God is almighty, Hatun.

02:04:50.472 --> 02:04:52.272
We will go and return, if God permits.

02:04:54.872 --> 02:04:56.139
Take care of yourself.

02:05:37.206 --> 02:05:39.106
I am going to meet with Sadettin Kobek.

02:05:40.372 --> 02:05:41.906
Watch Ertugrul carefully,
while I am not here.

02:05:42.839 --> 02:05:44.106
Do not worry.

02:05:51.339 --> 02:05:53.239
-Are you ready, Borklu?
-I am.

02:05:55.439 --> 02:05:56.806
They say the hunter becomes the hunt.

02:05:57.872 --> 02:05:59.139
Let them hunt.

02:06:03.539 --> 02:06:05.272
Say my greetings to the hunters.

02:06:23.339 --> 02:06:24.472
The Alps are ready, Bey.

02:06:24.639 --> 02:06:25.839
They are waiting for you
outside of nomad tent.

02:06:26.239 --> 02:06:27.306
Thank you, Kocabash.

02:06:41.772 --> 02:06:42.806
We are ready, mother.

02:06:44.139 --> 02:06:45.606
May God help you.

02:06:47.172 --> 02:06:49.639
I hope that God will ordain us
to take our revenge.

02:06:50.506 --> 02:06:51.572
Hopefully, uncle.

02:06:53.572 --> 02:06:55.839
It will be a vengeance befitting
our ancestor, Oghuz's glory, father.

02:06:57.572 --> 02:07:00.306
We will show the tyrants
what is bravery, if God permits.

02:07:15.139 --> 02:07:16.139
Alps!

02:07:18.306 --> 02:07:19.506
May our swords be sharp!

02:07:20.572 --> 02:07:21.772
May our faith be strong!

02:07:23.139 --> 02:07:26.339
May Khidr be our guide
and may God be our helper!

02:07:27.639 --> 02:07:28.706
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

02:07:29.306 --> 02:07:30.572
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

02:07:30.906 --> 02:07:32.206
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

02:07:32.472 --> 02:07:33.572
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

02:08:29.606 --> 02:08:30.839
I will return soon, Turk.

02:08:33.572 --> 02:08:37.806
When I return, you will either die
or be my dog.

02:12:20.506 --> 02:12:21.506
The captive is escaping!

02:13:19.739 --> 02:13:20.739
Ertugrul!
