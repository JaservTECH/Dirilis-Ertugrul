00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 36 will start after 12:03 min.

12:03.183 --> 12:07.183
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:08.420 --> 12:12.087
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:12.532 --> 12:14.532
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:24.354 --> 13:25.654
I heard that you are looking for me.

13:27.354 --> 13:28.487
Ertugrul.

13:34.720 --> 13:35.787
Ertugrul?

13:39.487 --> 13:40.787
My brave brother.

13:41.454 --> 13:46.420
Thanks to God I have seen you
while I am alive. That is enough for me.

14:20.687 --> 14:22.020
How are news in Konya?

14:22.454 --> 14:24.520
What does Sultan think
about Mongols bandits?

14:27.587 --> 14:29.754
We will send soldiers to borders
after winter.

14:30.620 --> 14:34.154
And they will be ready for war.
He sent me first.

14:34.820 --> 14:37.920
I am checking all the tribes
and areas that nearby.

14:38.987 --> 14:41.654
I am going to tell all the
information I got to him.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.787
What are you doing currently?
What is your goal now?

14:45.120 --> 14:47.887
I heard that you declared war against
Noyan while you are in this position.

14:49.354 --> 14:52.454
Small armies defeated big armies before.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.720
Incompetence is my greatest power.

14:56.554 --> 14:58.887
Noyan does not think I will attack him.

14:59.554 --> 15:01.520
I will attack when he is least expected.

15:02.054 --> 15:04.387
How many men do you have against Noyan?

15:06.687 --> 15:08.687
We will be four men when Bamsi got here.

15:09.754 --> 15:11.054
And I also have Geyikli.

15:13.120 --> 15:16.887
I do not know what you are thinking
but I am sure that you will do

15:17.120 --> 15:18.987
as you say despite of lack of manpower.

15:32.154 --> 15:33.854
I heard what happened in caravansary.

15:35.454 --> 15:36.820
What does Noyan want from you?

15:39.087 --> 15:42.920
I also want to talk with you about this.
It also concerns you.

15:43.687 --> 15:45.854
We had put a spy next to Ogeday.

15:47.354 --> 15:49.387
He has worked to us for years.

15:50.787 --> 15:54.554
They knew that there is a spy
but they did not know about his ID.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.154
But they are so close to find that out.

15:58.854 --> 16:00.620
What does it have to do with me?

16:00.987 --> 16:03.887
Because that spy is your brother.

16:05.854 --> 16:07.120
Sungurtekin.

16:33.720 --> 16:37.920
I am glad to hear that Sungurtekin
is alive and he is not a traitor

16:38.120 --> 16:39.720
as Noyan said.

16:40.854 --> 16:42.154
May you live long.

16:42.887 --> 16:44.887
My mother would be reborn if she knows it.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.587
Do not ever tell to anyone
what I told you.

16:48.154 --> 16:50.920
That is why Noyan wants to catch me
and make me speak.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.054
He wants to learn about spy
and some secret information

16:55.420 --> 16:57.054
of Seljuk Empire's army.

16:57.887 --> 17:00.087
You come to the cranny
near Tandir Hill tomorrow.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.787
I will show you
how to contact your brother

17:04.020 --> 17:05.854
in case if something happens to me.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.087
Nobody except you will know this secret.

17:16.054 --> 17:17.954
May you live long. Do not worry.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.154
I will be there as you asked.

18:17.354 --> 18:18.487
God damn it!

18:21.354 --> 18:22.487
Who was that?

18:31.054 --> 18:33.620
Almighty God knows and sees everything.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.987
Just like Kayis standing beside of their
brothers from Dodurga

18:39.354 --> 18:42.654
in such hard times
made us bigger and more powerful

18:43.920 --> 18:47.020
so I believe that our alliance
will see good things ahead of its.

18:47.387 --> 18:49.120
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

18:51.154 --> 18:57.587
Alliance of two nomad groups will open
new gates in this topsy turvy world

18:57.820 --> 18:59.854
with God's permission.
-If God permits.

19:00.454 --> 19:02.554
-If God permits, Bey.
-If God permits.

19:04.587 --> 19:06.354
The long and the short of it

19:07.620 --> 19:12.820
we are here because
we want your daughter Gokce

19:14.154 --> 19:16.654
to our son Tugtekin
for the name of God.

19:34.687 --> 19:35.920
First of all

19:37.054 --> 19:41.120
it is a big honour for me and
Kayis that Dodurga Bey is here

19:41.954 --> 19:47.020
in our tent to ask our daughter Gokce
for his son.

19:52.054 --> 19:54.620
Thanks to God me and Suleyman Shah

19:56.620 --> 20:00.454
have such great memories
during our lives.

20:02.554 --> 20:04.354
Those memories were marriages

20:06.420 --> 20:08.154
of Ertugrul and Halime

20:08.420 --> 20:11.787
Gundogdu and my daughter-in-law Selcan.

20:14.454 --> 20:18.687
I hope our Almighty God grants such
good marriages to our children

20:19.654 --> 20:22.020
Tugtekin and Gokce.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.820
-Amen.
-Amen.

20:25.387 --> 20:27.654
-Amen. If God permits.
-If God permits.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.520
I should get sherbets.

22:36.654 --> 22:38.720
-Ertugrul.
-You did not see me.

22:39.954 --> 22:41.054
I did not.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.387
I know that you are going to leave soon
but there is something

22:44.520 --> 22:45.954
that I want you to know.

22:46.687 --> 22:47.954
Korkut Bey.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.087
They came to ask me to his son Tugtekin.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.554
I know that.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.987
You should know that I am the
happiest person about it.

22:59.154 --> 23:01.120
I want you to be happy
more than anyone else.

23:04.554 --> 23:06.787
You think that I will get you
out of my heart, right?

23:07.554 --> 23:09.754
Gokce, do not do that.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.920
We have talked about it lots of times.
It hurts enough, and you...

23:16.120 --> 23:17.420
Go now.

23:18.554 --> 23:20.887
Do not worry. I will not
tell anyone that I saw you.

23:21.354 --> 23:22.820
Marry to Tugtekin.

23:23.887 --> 23:28.554
You should have a family,
children and dreams about future.

23:29.987 --> 23:31.354
Be happy.

23:32.987 --> 23:34.720
May God make you both happy.

24:17.420 --> 24:18.454
-Bey.
-Bey.

24:24.987 --> 24:26.987
-How are you, Turali?
-Thanks to God, Bey.

24:27.754 --> 24:30.087
You will be a brave Alp, if God permits.

24:30.520 --> 24:31.687
If God permits, Bey.

24:32.687 --> 24:33.887
If God permits.

24:38.054 --> 24:42.620
Alps, Ertokus Bey will leave early
in the morning with his soldiers.

24:43.887 --> 24:46.587
And you will meet me at Tandir Hill.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.920
Yes, Bey.

24:57.787 --> 24:58.787
Bey.

25:04.054 --> 25:05.920
Halime Sultan brought these to you.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.120
Thank you.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.587
Bey, it really makes me sad
that you are coming

25:26.854 --> 25:28.354
to your nomad group like this.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.687
Thanks to God we have a nomad group
to come, Turgut Alp.

25:38.087 --> 25:39.420
Thanks to God.

25:44.754 --> 25:46.354
There is nobody around here, Bey.

25:48.520 --> 25:49.654
May God bless you.

25:51.387 --> 25:52.587
You, too, Bey.

25:52.954 --> 25:55.053
Thank you, Bey. Thank you.

26:07.954 --> 26:09.887
How will it end, brother Turgut?

26:11.420 --> 26:16.954
Victory is mine when my weapon's
steel slices my enemy.

26:18.654 --> 26:22.820
If the enemy that my eyes cannot see,
that my weapon cannot slice

26:23.887 --> 26:26.054
is inside of us, then...

26:37.454 --> 26:38.587
What is it, brother?

26:41.420 --> 26:45.887
Alps were worried that there was
one suspicious person in nomad group.

26:47.420 --> 26:49.654
They said that they saw his shadow nearby.

26:50.787 --> 26:52.354
I worried about you.

26:53.387 --> 26:55.754
Thank you, Kocabash. Thank you.

26:57.720 --> 27:03.054
But if he was here you would have already
seen his head in front of you by now.

27:09.054 --> 27:10.420
I do not doubt it.

27:12.054 --> 27:13.420
Excuse me.

27:13.854 --> 27:15.654
We can come with you if you want, brother.

27:15.954 --> 27:18.120
No, thank you. We can take care of it.

27:39.454 --> 27:41.087
Let us hope best for everyone,
if God permits.

27:43.154 --> 27:44.454
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

27:44.687 --> 27:46.020
-Amen.
-If God permits.

27:53.720 --> 27:54.820
Thank you, girl.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.354
My daughter Gokce.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.987
I and your big brother, Halime Sultan

28:50.487 --> 28:53.387
are honoured by Korkut Bey's offer.

28:56.020 --> 28:57.787
We think it is a blessed thing.

28:59.487 --> 29:01.820
Of course I will make this decision

29:02.020 --> 29:07.720
but I want to hear the excitement
we have from you, too.

29:11.020 --> 29:13.454
It is easy to arrange it but...

29:15.920 --> 29:17.920
...love is meant for two person.

29:51.854 --> 29:56.820
It is a big honour for me to be a woman
of a Bey like Tugtekin.

30:06.620 --> 30:08.654
I will also want to have
this honour all my life.

30:16.820 --> 30:18.587
It will make me happy

30:20.787 --> 30:23.054
that having Tugtekin's
children and life.

30:26.987 --> 30:29.420
Since they think I am suitable for this

30:30.920 --> 30:32.754
I would think it is my duty...

30:37.854 --> 30:39.120
...and say yes, Mother Hayme.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.354
Good luck.

30:59.820 --> 31:00.954
Good luck.

31:36.087 --> 31:39.354
<i>To the people who establish states</i>
 <i>and who demolish states.</i>

31:40.087 --> 31:42.687
<i>Greetings from Artuk who is on duty.</i>

31:43.720 --> 31:46.154
<i>Ertugrul found out that</i>
 <i>his brother is alive.</i>

31:47.354 --> 31:50.920
<i>Things have became more complicated</i>
 <i>in Dodurga nomad group.</i>

31:52.020 --> 31:56.954
<i>Ertugrul is still fighting</i>
 <i>despite every challenges.</i>

31:58.454 --> 32:01.154
<i>I will always keep an eye on him.</i>

32:03.520 --> 32:04.520
Ertugrul Bey.

32:15.954 --> 32:18.620
Welcome, Bey. I hope there is
a good reason of you here.

32:19.954 --> 32:21.420
There is. There is.

32:22.154 --> 32:25.154
First of all, I am grateful of
your help saving Abdurrahman.

32:26.654 --> 32:31.454
There will be always someone to help you
as long as you seek for justice, Bey.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.054
Thank you.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.520
However there is a more important matter.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.854
We must find that traitor in nomad group
immediately, Artuk Bey.

32:41.154 --> 32:44.620
There will be always traitors, Bey.
Always there will be.

32:45.520 --> 32:50.754
Important thing is the act of those
whose goal is justice.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.520
So?

32:53.720 --> 32:59.754
So if we want to stop Mongols
we must rebel against them all together.

33:00.820 --> 33:02.987
If you want to light that
resurrection fire

33:03.720 --> 33:10.054
Samarkand, Bukhara and even Jerusalem
must share your dreams, Bey.

33:14.020 --> 33:20.120
My will is your will but if we want
to light resurrection fire

33:21.354 --> 33:23.754
we must burn traitors in that fire.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.854
We burn traitors in that fire
so our fire's power would increase.

33:30.954 --> 33:32.920
It is correct, Bey. Correct.

33:34.054 --> 33:36.720
When will I see Bey during daylight again?

33:38.487 --> 33:41.020
Every dark night has
a divine morning, Artuk Bey.

33:42.087 --> 33:46.120
Night covers up secrets.
Day reveals secrets.

33:47.020 --> 33:48.920
May you always be in safe.

33:49.587 --> 33:52.420
May your secrets always stay as secrets.

33:55.087 --> 33:56.387
Thank you.

33:57.620 --> 34:00.487
Excuse me now, Bey. Keep your eyes open.

34:01.620 --> 34:03.720
We need to find that traitor
in nomad group quickly.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.454
You do not worry about it, Bey.

34:06.654 --> 34:08.987
Day reveals all traitors.

34:34.722 --> 34:36.122
Good luck, son.

34:42.556 --> 34:43.622
My girl.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.422
If God permits you will be so happy.

34:55.622 --> 34:56.789
If God permits.

35:05.089 --> 35:07.856
If God permits, we will arrange
your wedding soon, girl.

35:08.156 --> 35:09.389
If God permits.

35:13.389 --> 35:16.622
They match each other
very well, Korkut Bey.

35:19.189 --> 35:21.289
May you have a long lasting marriage.

35:21.722 --> 35:23.122
Thank you.

35:30.756 --> 35:32.289
Good luck, sister.

35:32.856 --> 35:34.422
Thank you, Bey.

36:25.656 --> 36:27.856
I wish your sister was here to see it.

36:29.622 --> 36:33.622
May God heal her quickly.
-Amen. Thank you, mother.

36:39.789 --> 36:41.656
I had one child before.

36:42.556 --> 36:45.189
Now I have two children, Korkut Bey.

36:46.456 --> 36:48.789
I now have a daughter.

37:11.389 --> 37:12.622
There is more.

37:13.689 --> 37:18.189
There was one other man
who was spying on them like me.

37:18.789 --> 37:20.222
Who?

37:21.156 --> 37:22.556
I could not see him.

37:25.222 --> 37:27.189
He did not see me, as well.
-How come?

37:27.822 --> 37:29.789
Who is he working for then?

37:32.422 --> 37:35.189
There are other things we do not know
going on in nomad group, Efrasiyab.

37:36.289 --> 37:38.556
You should talk about it with Noyan
when you get there.

37:39.356 --> 37:41.422
You also tell him that I have
a great gift for him.

37:43.422 --> 37:47.622
Ertugrul and Atabey Ertokus
will meet at a place secretly.

37:50.289 --> 37:51.489
At Tandir Hill.

37:54.689 --> 37:58.789
Noyan's duty now is cut off their heads.

38:17.356 --> 38:22.222
I wish Ertugrul was with us
on our happy day.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.256
If God permits he will come
to our wedding, Mother Hayma.

38:40.222 --> 38:41.389
If God permits, girl.

38:48.722 --> 38:50.122
Have a good night.

39:05.856 --> 39:07.856
-Excuse me, Mother.
-Gundogdu.

39:10.722 --> 39:13.789
Son, do you want to talk to Selcan

39:14.656 --> 39:17.522
one more time for this
beautiful day's sake?

39:18.122 --> 39:21.422
I do not, mother. I have said
my thoughts. It is done.

39:22.722 --> 39:24.189
Good evening.

39:44.589 --> 39:45.756
Bey.

39:46.689 --> 39:48.856
Your weapon is being sharpened
for new hunts?

39:50.122 --> 39:52.856
My weapon always hunted since I got it.

39:55.656 --> 39:57.456
It is always ready for war.

40:00.189 --> 40:03.822
However your weapon's shining
differently today.

40:04.822 --> 40:07.122
Like it is going to heal a pain.

40:07.722 --> 40:09.856
Like it is going to be a messenger
for a reunion.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.289
It is going to remedy such longings.

40:19.556 --> 40:23.822
It is going to heal such pain so
my mother Hayma will see sunrise again.

40:25.556 --> 40:29.456
We are so close to reunion with
our so longing brother Sungurtekin.

40:30.222 --> 40:34.189
We give our life to one
who makes reunion happen

40:34.622 --> 40:37.856
who heals the pain
who silences the evil tongue, Bey.

40:40.822 --> 40:43.822
May your weapon live long.
May your power never end, Bey.

40:44.756 --> 40:46.156
Thank you.

40:47.156 --> 40:51.456
I want you to keep an eye
under every rock, every tree hole.

40:51.789 --> 40:53.855
You do not care about normal eye.

40:55.622 --> 40:57.856
You care about the eye of here.

41:02.222 --> 41:03.389
Thank you.

41:27.389 --> 41:30.656
May Hizir is your comrade,
Zulfiqar is your weapon

41:31.289 --> 41:33.356
and Duldul is your horse, my hero.

41:47.489 --> 41:49.289
This is what Efrasiyab told.

41:53.222 --> 41:54.489
Nice.

41:56.122 --> 41:59.556
Kocabash acted smartly
by not killing Ertugrul.

42:01.389 --> 42:03.556
He has killed two birds with one stone.

42:06.122 --> 42:09.322
I am going to capture
the best Alp of Oghuz tribes

42:10.589 --> 42:14.456
and the best commander of Seljuk army.

42:16.389 --> 42:18.722
Konya will be shocked
after this disgustful assassination.

42:57.789 --> 43:01.322
-Have a good trip, Atabey Ertokus.
-Thank you.

43:03.122 --> 43:06.422
There are always people
who is trying to get a cut

43:06.622 --> 43:10.422
from Sultan Alaeddin's politeness
and get a position in the palace

43:10.656 --> 43:13.322
because of political ambitions
in such difficult days.

43:16.189 --> 43:19.489
Do not try to do anything
because of your ambitions

43:19.689 --> 43:23.256
in the rooms of Konya Palace,
Korkut Bey.

43:33.289 --> 43:35.722
What do you mean, Atabey Ertokus?

43:36.689 --> 43:38.589
Your brother-in-law Gumustekin

43:39.789 --> 43:42.656
is always nearby of Sadettin Kobek.

43:43.489 --> 43:47.356
Everybody in palace know
what you are up to.

43:50.289 --> 43:52.622
You stay away from political ambitions.

43:53.622 --> 43:55.822
You can get yourself into trouble.

43:58.689 --> 44:02.622
We have been fighting against Mongols
for years for our state and Sultan.

44:04.356 --> 44:08.289
You are threatening my father like
you do not know about it, Atabey Ertokus.

44:14.722 --> 44:20.356
Your son Tugtekin has already been
poisoned, Korkut Bey.

44:29.256 --> 44:30.456
Excuse me.

44:42.456 --> 44:45.689
He is threatening you
while looking into our eyes, Bey.

44:53.122 --> 44:57.289
Sultan Alaeddin will not give
margrave that I want, Hatun.

44:59.289 --> 45:02.156
They think Sultans rule the states.

45:03.256 --> 45:06.522
You should know that ones who think
like that are always wrong, Bey.

45:07.189 --> 45:09.156
You are talking about
Sadettin Kobek, mother?

45:10.722 --> 45:13.356
What state makes state is
the power of Sadettin Kobek

45:13.522 --> 45:15.389
and other statesmen like him.

45:18.089 --> 45:20.056
Politics is also a war, Bey.

45:21.656 --> 45:25.556
As you know, my brother Gumustekin
knows it by heart.

45:26.856 --> 45:32.056
He has been working in Konya such long
time for you and for our nomad group.

45:35.156 --> 45:37.289
He will not be returned
without your request.

46:13.056 --> 46:14.456
What is wrong with you, Selcan?

46:16.456 --> 46:18.122
It is nothing, Halime.

46:19.756 --> 46:21.789
It is nothing anymore.

46:25.056 --> 46:26.822
I dreamed about history.

46:28.722 --> 46:32.289
I was so happy the day
I was going to marry my Gundogdu.

46:33.489 --> 46:35.356
I was very happy.

46:37.156 --> 46:41.322
But now we have separated our tents.

46:43.289 --> 46:45.522
Heavens fell down on me.

46:46.856 --> 46:51.322
And my sister is marrying someone
who I do not want.

46:53.422 --> 46:56.522
Every cloud has a silver lining, Selcan.

46:57.256 --> 46:58.856
You do not worry.

47:00.456 --> 47:03.256
Only silver lining in this cloud
is for you, Halime.

47:05.522 --> 47:06.722
Selcan.

47:09.756 --> 47:12.722
I know that storm in the heart
of Gokce is not finishing.

47:14.156 --> 47:20.289
I also know that you want to be the wife
of Ertugrul Bey if it is up to you.

47:26.622 --> 47:28.522
Let us hope for the best, Selcan.

47:30.656 --> 47:34.289
You will be together again once
Gundogdu Bey is calm down.

47:37.256 --> 47:39.289
It is different this time, Halime.

47:39.722 --> 47:42.156
We have great cliffs between us.

47:43.489 --> 47:49.489
My Gundogdu's eyes do not look as they
were before even he is so angry.

47:52.489 --> 47:53.789
Who knows?

47:55.222 --> 48:01.356
Maybe Bey loves someone else.

49:04.789 --> 49:07.689
So Sungurtekin is the spy
inside of Ogeday.

49:09.122 --> 49:11.289
He has cheated all of us for years.

49:12.489 --> 49:13.689
Even you.

49:19.556 --> 49:22.189
All the children of Suleyman Shah
are going to die.

49:24.289 --> 49:27.289
Sungurtekin. Gundogdu. Dundar.

49:28.822 --> 49:30.556
And of course Ertugrul.

49:33.056 --> 49:38.689
Ogeday will be so happy
when he finds out spy's identity.

49:42.589 --> 49:44.356
Of course he will be happy.

49:47.622 --> 49:52.756
But I gave that Sungurtekin
bastard to Ogeday.

49:55.756 --> 49:58.289
It seems that I will set the cat
among the pigeons.

49:59.156 --> 50:01.556
Ogeday will ask for it.

50:09.089 --> 50:11.789
These Kayis have made my life
really hard, Ulubilge.

50:17.689 --> 50:20.589
So I have to turn their world into hell.

50:25.122 --> 50:26.456
Write it down, Ulubilge.

50:27.822 --> 50:29.856
We must deliver
this information immediately.

51:17.289 --> 51:19.122
-You wait here.
-Yes, Bey.

51:19.256 --> 51:21.322
-Nobody moves.
-Yes, Bey.

52:07.556 --> 52:09.256
Death is here for you.

53:18.122 --> 53:19.856
Ogeday is about to win against China.

53:20.622 --> 53:22.556
He will come to Anatolia soon.

53:27.289 --> 53:29.356
May you live long, Sungurtekin Bey.

53:29.456 --> 53:32.622
If God permits you will not become
martyr before meeting your family.

53:44.756 --> 53:46.122
Be careful!

55:32.089 --> 55:35.689
Hamza! Ertokus is escaping.
Follow him with Abdurrahman.

55:36.356 --> 55:38.556
Do not forget that Noyan wants him alive.

55:39.789 --> 55:42.289
I will stay here with my men
and take care of Ertugrul.

55:42.622 --> 55:44.289
Abdurrahman, let us go! Come on!

57:54.756 --> 57:56.489
Soldier. Soldier.

57:59.456 --> 58:00.756
Traitors.

58:01.522 --> 58:04.256
It is me. Ertugrul Bey from Kayis.

58:05.622 --> 58:07.389
You are all traitors.

58:09.389 --> 58:12.256
Kayis will pay for their betrayal.

58:17.089 --> 58:18.322
Traitors!

58:19.222 --> 58:20.822
You are all traitors!

58:24.189 --> 58:25.389
Unskillfuls!

01:00:09.489 --> 01:00:11.356
Here we are again, Ertugrul.

01:00:12.189 --> 01:00:13.789
Here we are again, Tangut.

01:00:14.456 --> 01:00:16.256
You cannot escape from us.

01:00:17.156 --> 01:00:18.856
You cannot get rid of Ertugrul.

01:01:40.622 --> 01:01:42.156
Atabey Ertokus!

01:01:45.256 --> 01:01:46.422
Lay down arms!

01:01:47.056 --> 01:01:49.756
How did you find here?
It was impossible for you to follow!

01:01:50.522 --> 01:01:52.456
Noyan has told us your location.

01:01:53.256 --> 01:01:55.656
Ertugrul was right.
There is a traitor in nomad group.

01:01:55.822 --> 01:01:57.622
I said drop your sword.

01:01:58.489 --> 01:02:00.056
Come and take it.

01:02:00.656 --> 01:02:02.156
Abdurrahman.

01:02:02.756 --> 01:02:05.489
Do not forget. Noyan wants him alive.

01:02:23.722 --> 01:02:26.689
You will pay for it, scumbag traitors!

01:02:57.256 --> 01:02:59.322
You are done this time, Ertugrul!

01:06:34.255 --> 01:06:35.755
Atabey Ertokus is not here.

01:06:37.556 --> 01:06:40.489
That asshat run away by horse, Bey.
Who is he, Bey?

01:06:41.156 --> 01:06:43.456
Tangut. Noyan's right hand.

01:06:45.255 --> 01:06:47.589
It seems that
they took Atabey Ertokus alive.

01:06:47.689 --> 01:06:51.422
Hamza and traitor Alps did it.
That traitor in nomad group.

01:06:53.389 --> 01:06:55.456
They must have followed us last night.

01:07:00.622 --> 01:07:02.422
We must rescue Atabey Ertokus.

01:07:36.456 --> 01:07:37.589
Gokce Hatun.

01:07:43.389 --> 01:07:46.089
-Have a good day, Bey.
-Have a good day, Gokce.

01:07:48.122 --> 01:07:50.156
Last night was the best night of my life.

01:07:51.222 --> 01:07:53.756
Especially your words to my parents
have been scratched

01:07:54.756 --> 01:07:56.756
into my heart forever.

01:08:00.122 --> 01:08:04.722
I have always seen the kindness in your
heart when I looked into your eyes.

01:08:10.689 --> 01:08:14.056
I have devoted my life to you from now on.

01:08:19.156 --> 01:08:20.422
Excuse me.

01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:41.322
Wedding is close.

01:08:41.622 --> 01:08:45.489
If you act quickly
we may have a double wedding.

01:08:48.089 --> 01:08:50.689
Are you so sure that Gundogdu wants me?

01:08:51.622 --> 01:08:55.556
After spending so many years
with that woman whose inside

01:08:56.289 --> 01:08:58.289
is so drought like desert
your youth and beauty

01:08:58.489 --> 01:09:00.456
will petrify my Gundogdu.

01:09:01.456 --> 01:09:03.422
You will be his mirage.

01:09:04.722 --> 01:09:07.656
He could not take his eyes from you
last night. Did not you see it?

01:09:12.089 --> 01:09:14.789
Is it true that him and Selcan Hatun
separated their beds?

01:09:15.322 --> 01:09:19.389
Separation? If there was not Kocabash
Gundogdu was going be a killer.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:22.756
He was going to cut off her head.

01:09:24.389 --> 01:09:26.756
He has saved that
shameless woman last minute.

01:09:27.122 --> 01:09:30.356
If I were Selcan
I would have gone already.

01:09:31.122 --> 01:09:33.189
But she is so indecent.

01:09:34.622 --> 01:09:37.856
She will do anything to be in his face.

01:09:40.056 --> 01:09:41.689
My job is hard then.

01:09:42.422 --> 01:09:44.056
You have no idea.

01:09:46.722 --> 01:09:48.322
What should I do, aunt?

01:09:49.389 --> 01:09:51.622
Give Gundogdu a little bit of courage.

01:09:52.056 --> 01:09:55.322
Then rest will be easy and quick.

01:09:58.322 --> 01:10:00.689
I will do anything that I can, aunt.

01:10:02.322 --> 01:10:05.089
Since we are going to let Kayis
into our nomad group

01:10:05.556 --> 01:10:08.822
since we will be stronger
and take margrave that we deserve

01:10:09.156 --> 01:10:10.789
then I will do what it takes.

01:10:12.156 --> 01:10:15.656
But I will do it my way, aunt.

01:10:18.156 --> 01:10:20.289
Selcan Hatun hates you.

01:10:21.256 --> 01:10:23.256
Hayma and Halime
are keeping their distant.

01:10:24.289 --> 01:10:26.789
We will lose if we do it your way.

01:10:30.156 --> 01:10:32.089
How will you approach them?

01:10:54.556 --> 01:10:55.556
Geyikli?

01:10:55.722 --> 01:10:58.689
Bey, following path is not an open road.

01:10:59.322 --> 01:11:01.389
I saw Abdurrahman and Hamza.

01:11:01.756 --> 01:11:04.389
They took Atabey Ertokus as prisoner.

01:11:04.822 --> 01:11:06.656
They are taking him to Noyan.

01:11:10.556 --> 01:11:13.522
But you should not follow them.

01:11:14.289 --> 01:11:16.589
There are Noyan's soldiers around.

01:11:17.122 --> 01:11:18.722
There are too many of them.

01:11:23.389 --> 01:11:26.122
I say we should wait for Abdurrahman
in my poor house.

01:11:42.822 --> 01:11:44.222
Gokce Hatun!

01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:52.222
Have a good day, Gokce Hatun.

01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:54.589
You, too, Goncagul.

01:11:54.789 --> 01:11:57.356
I have thought a lot last night, Gokce.

01:11:58.056 --> 01:12:01.689
I have lived in palace in Konya
with my father since long time.

01:12:02.289 --> 01:12:05.222
I am so afraid what if I cannot live
nomad group's life?

01:12:05.456 --> 01:12:09.656
What if I cannot take it?
But it was not like that.

01:12:10.556 --> 01:12:12.456
Thank God it was not like that.

01:12:14.056 --> 01:12:15.656
I just missed this life.

01:12:18.056 --> 01:12:22.056
I got my courage when I saw that I have
relatives like you and I got happier.

01:12:22.489 --> 01:12:24.589
Welcome aboard, Gokce Hatun.

01:12:25.489 --> 01:12:26.789
Thank you.

01:12:27.322 --> 01:12:30.389
May God give you a Bey
like Tugtekin, Goncagul.

01:12:30.856 --> 01:12:32.322
I hope so.

01:12:35.356 --> 01:12:37.156
How is palace, Goncagul?

01:12:39.556 --> 01:12:41.122
It is like heaven.

01:12:43.656 --> 01:12:47.756
It hypnotises you. It holds you in
and never let you go again.

01:12:49.422 --> 01:12:52.722
Until an enemy comes
and stabs you in the back.

01:12:55.256 --> 01:12:57.622
So it is no different
than our nomad group.

01:13:04.389 --> 01:13:06.556
I am glad you think like that, Selcan.

01:13:08.056 --> 01:13:10.222
This is the best move for everyone, girl.

01:13:11.722 --> 01:13:13.389
My beautiful mother.

01:13:15.089 --> 01:13:18.456
I know that you have doubts.
I can see that.

01:13:20.056 --> 01:13:23.422
But you must know that
you did the right thing, mother.

01:13:25.089 --> 01:13:27.256
May God give them a happy life.

01:13:28.256 --> 01:13:29.789
If God permits, girl.

01:13:31.489 --> 01:13:34.089
-May we come in, Mother Hayma?
-Come, girl.

01:13:41.289 --> 01:13:42.789
Welcome, girl. Come.

01:13:44.456 --> 01:13:45.689
Greetings.

01:13:49.056 --> 01:13:51.256
I have brought gifts from Konya.

01:13:52.556 --> 01:13:56.222
I have chosen these gifts with my father
who loves and respect you.

01:13:56.389 --> 01:13:58.322
You should not have to bother, girl.

01:13:58.822 --> 01:14:02.056
These are for babies
of Halime Sultan and Ertugrul Bey.

01:14:07.156 --> 01:14:10.389
Thank you. You should not have.

01:14:16.856 --> 01:14:19.856
I am honoured to take these gifts
on behalf of Ertugrul Bey.

01:14:21.222 --> 01:14:23.389
May you live long, Goncagul Hatun.

01:14:24.622 --> 01:14:26.256
Excuse me, mother.

01:14:35.156 --> 01:14:36.656
Did I say something wrong?

01:14:37.589 --> 01:14:38.756
No.

01:14:39.689 --> 01:14:42.122
She is sad about Ertugrul's situation.

01:14:44.489 --> 01:14:46.356
I do not know what to say.

01:14:47.456 --> 01:14:50.356
You have made us really happy
with these gifts, girl.

01:14:51.156 --> 01:14:52.456
Thank you.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:56.756
-If I made Halime Sultan sad...
-No. It is not about you.

01:14:58.856 --> 01:15:00.489
There is no such thing.

01:15:02.556 --> 01:15:04.556
You are in the family now.

01:15:05.589 --> 01:15:09.522
We shared our fate in good and bad days.

01:15:16.622 --> 01:15:21.089
I cannot thank God enough
since I have relatives like you.

01:15:23.556 --> 01:15:27.522
I am so happy after the blissfulness
that we had last night.

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:45.297
How many days of road left?

01:15:49.197 --> 01:15:50.697
We will be there in one day, Bey.

01:15:53.397 --> 01:15:55.830
-Dervish.
-Yes, sheikh?

01:15:57.863 --> 01:16:00.630
You have been my comrade for long years.

01:16:00.863 --> 01:16:04.130
You know what it means to be on roads
and to be comrade?

01:16:04.397 --> 01:16:05.797
What is it, Bey?

01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:09.530
Sirat-i mustakim, son.

01:16:09.863 --> 01:16:12.163
Which means right path.

01:16:12.730 --> 01:16:17.397
If we serve to God only,
if we ask for help from God only

01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:19.763
it means we are on the right path.

01:16:20.297 --> 01:16:24.697
If we walk for reputation and cruelty
we would be out of our path.

01:16:26.663 --> 01:16:30.197
May God let us not leave our path.
-Amen.

01:16:46.563 --> 01:16:49.130
We would become like this
if we leave our path.

01:16:49.597 --> 01:16:50.830
Give a hand.

01:17:00.863 --> 01:17:03.430
-Raise your head.
-He is wounded badly.

01:17:04.863 --> 01:17:07.663
-Who are you people?
-Who are you?

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:11.497
You bled a lot.
-I have been attacked.

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:16.497
If God permits.

01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:22.430
So you have enemies.

01:17:23.363 --> 01:17:25.130
Bandits attacked me.

01:17:25.697 --> 01:17:27.797
So you do not walk on right path.

01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:32.230
We have come this far but we did
not see any bandits or tyrants.

01:17:36.230 --> 01:17:41.830
Son, you would get more wound
if your path is not right.

01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:48.663
Who are you? Where do you come and go?

01:17:49.397 --> 01:17:51.897
We come from there to go where.

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:01.897
You are weak. Do not torture yourself.

01:18:05.663 --> 01:18:06.897
I must go.

01:18:07.630 --> 01:18:10.130
I must go. I must go.
-Sheikh.

01:18:12.597 --> 01:18:15.463
Let him go, dervish. He must go his way.

01:18:16.897 --> 01:18:18.297
Let him go.

01:18:24.597 --> 01:18:25.730
Give him water.

01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:44.463
-I will not forget this favor of yours.
-Alright.

01:18:53.263 --> 01:18:55.530
Bey, why did we let him go like this?

01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:58.397
He has something that belongs to us.

01:18:59.563 --> 01:19:01.830
I hope he will take it to us.

01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:16.630
Thank God, our nomad group
is at peace a little bit.

01:19:19.497 --> 01:19:21.330
I wish Ertugrul was here, too.

01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:24.263
My peace will be clinched.

01:19:26.263 --> 01:19:28.130
He should come back, sister.

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:30.897
There is no resentment anymore.

01:19:33.497 --> 01:19:37.297
Only Alps know where Ertugrul is.

01:19:38.297 --> 01:19:40.663
And they would not tell you
even if you kill them.

01:19:43.597 --> 01:19:46.630
It seems that Ertugrul
is not going to return

01:19:46.797 --> 01:19:48.763
in order not to give
any harm to nomad group.

01:19:50.497 --> 01:19:52.797
I hope he will not cause
new troubles to us.

01:19:58.897 --> 01:20:02.530
I think we should arrange a big wedding
for Tugtekin and Gokce.

01:20:03.763 --> 01:20:05.330
We should, brother.

01:20:05.497 --> 01:20:08.897
This wedding would refresh
and clean our nomad groups.

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:11.163
If God permits.

01:20:12.097 --> 01:20:13.563
By the way, sister

01:20:14.497 --> 01:20:17.097
since we have peace
in our nomad group again

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:20.163
Kayi Alps should wear their weapons.

01:20:45.263 --> 01:20:46.630
What is going on, Dogan?

01:20:51.563 --> 01:20:54.430
I am laughing about these infidels
always chasing us.

01:21:01.397 --> 01:21:03.363
I do not know if infidels are chasing us

01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:08.463
or we are stirring up infidels' nest?

01:21:12.897 --> 01:21:15.697
Titus, Ustad, Kurdoglu.

01:21:16.563 --> 01:21:19.830
Now Noyan. And also Tangut.
-So?

01:21:20.663 --> 01:21:25.263
We are killing these guys
but are they having a chat in hell?

01:21:27.197 --> 01:21:30.497
"How did Ertugrul Bey kill us?
How did Turgut chop us with his axe?

01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:32.863
How did Dogan hunt us like bird?"

01:21:36.697 --> 01:21:38.897
Brother, you have became like Bamsi.

01:21:40.697 --> 01:21:42.830
If Bamsi was here it
would not be enough for him.

01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:46.263
He would say, "I will go to hell
and kick their asses."

01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:52.197
He would even go to hell
to kick their asses.

01:21:57.363 --> 01:21:59.330
We miss brother Bamsi.

01:22:00.597 --> 01:22:02.763
It is only a matter of time
that he would be here soon.

01:22:06.763 --> 01:22:09.497
He would say,
"What have you done without me?"

01:22:13.597 --> 01:22:15.763
I hope he would be here without any harm.

01:22:21.797 --> 01:22:23.163
Alps.

01:22:27.097 --> 01:22:29.263
Traitor in nomad group annoys us.

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:32.563
We are not in comfort till we find him.

01:22:45.397 --> 01:22:49.230
We took a big step in order to
socialize two nomad groups, Aytolun.

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:50.897
Thanks to you.

01:22:52.697 --> 01:22:54.897
Two kids love each other, Bey.

01:22:55.730 --> 01:22:58.730
It is a good thing so we lead this.

01:22:59.463 --> 01:23:02.197
I hope rest would be
happen as you want, Bey.

01:23:03.163 --> 01:23:06.897
When it is time two nomad groups
will be sharing a common fate.

01:23:09.663 --> 01:23:12.497
Let us hope you get the margrave.

01:23:20.163 --> 01:23:23.663
It will not so easy
to convince Sultan Alaeddin.

01:23:25.397 --> 01:23:27.197
You should be patient, Bey.

01:23:27.697 --> 01:23:29.863
You will get what you want.

01:23:32.497 --> 01:23:34.330
My brother Gumustekin

01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:41.197
will not be returned
from Konya without your request.

01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:07.230
Mother Hayme.

01:24:08.563 --> 01:24:10.330
What will I do without you?

01:24:23.363 --> 01:24:24.730
My beautiful girl.

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:31.097
I will be always there for you.

01:24:34.297 --> 01:24:35.597
Mother Hayme.

01:24:37.897 --> 01:24:40.330
What if I could not get pregnant
because of that evil knife

01:24:40.463 --> 01:24:42.430
that was stabbed to my body?

01:24:43.897 --> 01:24:46.197
What if I cannot give a baby
to my husband?

01:24:49.330 --> 01:24:50.597
My daughter Gokce.

01:24:51.597 --> 01:24:57.530
Sometimes a knife takes out pus
from a wound.

01:25:00.563 --> 01:25:02.730
Only God know about it.

01:25:04.397 --> 01:25:06.863
We just need to walk on right path.

01:25:10.530 --> 01:25:13.397
Come on, have a nice sleep. Okay?

01:25:59.863 --> 01:26:02.263
<i>I want to see you happy</i>
 <i>more than anyone else.</i>

01:26:02.663 --> 01:26:05.797
<i>You should have children</i>
 <i>and dreams about future.</i>

01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:23.563
<i>We will both be fine, Gokce.</i>

01:26:25.797 --> 01:26:28.430
<i>From now on, no more crying.</i>

01:26:29.230 --> 01:26:31.430
<i>No more love pain.</i>

01:26:32.297 --> 01:26:34.597
<i>I will have love, they will have pain.</i>

01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:37.497
<i>My revenge will keep me alive.</i>

01:26:52.363 --> 01:26:53.597
Gundogdu Bey.

01:26:55.663 --> 01:26:57.497
Good morning, Goncagul Hatun.

01:26:57.663 --> 01:26:59.797
Good morning, Gundogdu Bey.

01:27:02.663 --> 01:27:05.530
I have heard that you are taking care
of trades of our nomad groups.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:07.430
That's correct.

01:27:07.697 --> 01:27:11.330
As you know, I was in Konya last
five years because of my father's work.

01:27:12.663 --> 01:27:16.130
On this wise I have written
and read his letters.

01:27:16.330 --> 01:27:19.530
I have tried to help him
with his work as much as I can.

01:27:20.530 --> 01:27:23.363
If you want to make use of my literacy
I want you to know that

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:27.130
I want to help you as much as I can.

01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:29.897
By the way, I know how to speak
Persian and Greek a little bit.

01:27:30.363 --> 01:27:34.263
That's wonderful. What can I say?
That was just I needed.

01:27:34.497 --> 01:27:38.397
Serving a Bey like you will
make me so happy, Bey.

01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:41.797
Do not mention it. Excuse me.
Base is waiting for me.

01:27:47.363 --> 01:27:48.563
Goncagul Hatun.

01:27:50.497 --> 01:27:51.797
Yes, Selcan Hatun?

01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:54.563
I want to talk to you about a matter.

01:27:55.563 --> 01:27:56.630
Sure.

01:27:57.730 --> 01:28:01.830
I sometimes went against to your aunt
due to nomad group's matters.

01:28:05.130 --> 01:28:08.430
Since Tugtekin is going to marry
my sister Gokce

01:28:09.097 --> 01:28:11.897
I think we should end this
disagreeableness between us.

01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:16.197
You are a nice girl. Maybe I...

01:28:16.597 --> 01:28:21.263
You do not worry, Selcan Hatun.
My Aunt and you are very nice people.

01:28:21.897 --> 01:28:24.730
This marriage will unite us all.

01:28:25.563 --> 01:28:28.430
I am so happy to hearing this from you.

01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:39.463
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:28:59.197 --> 01:29:04.230
So Efrasiyab have seen
all goods we have one by one.

01:29:04.597 --> 01:29:06.897
He knows every animal in our flock.

01:29:07.863 --> 01:29:10.397
He knows animals by their teeth.

01:29:16.697 --> 01:29:19.297
He also knows us better than us.

01:29:19.663 --> 01:29:22.230
He knows that we are man of our word.

01:29:23.363 --> 01:29:26.830
So I say that we should accept his offer.

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:30.697
But only under one condition.

01:29:32.297 --> 01:29:35.097
He will pay coins in advance.

01:29:41.563 --> 01:29:46.730
There is no way to sell our animals
and goods using any other way

01:29:47.130 --> 01:29:50.597
in such times that bandits are all around.

01:30:00.263 --> 01:30:02.530
I think you are right, Gundogdu Bey.

01:30:25.663 --> 01:30:26.897
Gumustekin Bey.

01:30:31.630 --> 01:30:33.196
Welcome to your nomad group, Bey.

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:39.730
When I see you in such townee dress...
-Is Korkut Bey in his marquee?

01:30:41.763 --> 01:30:45.330
We have not expected you too soon, Bey.
They are in headquarters with Kayi Beys.

01:30:48.397 --> 01:30:50.497
You have talked about what is right.

01:30:51.563 --> 01:30:53.196
I also think it is okay.

01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:56.763
Beys, do you have anything to say?

01:31:00.397 --> 01:31:02.697
-It is okay, Bey.
-It is okay, Bey.

01:31:04.697 --> 01:31:05.897
It is okay, Bey.

01:31:12.597 --> 01:31:14.563
Then good luck to all of us.

01:31:15.463 --> 01:31:17.863
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

01:31:20.297 --> 01:31:23.697
-Thank you. Good luck.
-Thank you.

01:31:50.230 --> 01:31:52.597
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:55.530
-And peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:31:57.130 --> 01:31:59.130
Welcome to your nomad group,
Gumustekin Bey.

01:32:04.763 --> 01:32:06.430
Welcome, Gumustekin Bey.

01:32:07.363 --> 01:32:10.630
You have not changed in years.
You are always same.

01:32:11.563 --> 01:32:14.463
Thank you, Mother Hayme.
Thank you, Korkut Bey.

01:32:14.663 --> 01:32:17.163
However I do not have good news.

01:32:26.530 --> 01:32:28.530
Sit down first. You have come a long way.

01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:30.697
Bring ayran to Gumustekin Bey.

01:32:48.197 --> 01:32:52.530
Brave Beys of two nomad groups.
As you know last three years

01:32:52.663 --> 01:32:56.330
I was on duty at Konya palace
as our state's request.

01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:01.863
I left my nomad tent
and served for Sultan

01:33:02.663 --> 01:33:04.630
with the permission from Korkut Bey.

01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:10.630
Of course I am honored to do my duty.

01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:13.797
Especially fighting against
infidel Mongols.

01:33:16.597 --> 01:33:19.130
I have seen a lot,
I have experienced a lot.

01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:26.197
My duty at palace is finished now.
I left Konya and was happy

01:33:27.197 --> 01:33:32.163
to be appointed in my nomad group
till war day by Sultan's order.

01:33:35.263 --> 01:33:40.363
However, I have never thought that
I was going to have

01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:44.630
such contemptibleness,
such shame, such pain!

01:33:51.163 --> 01:33:53.797
What did happen, Gumustekin Bey? Tell us.

01:33:58.463 --> 01:34:01.230
They have attacked Ertokus Bey
and his soldiers on their way.

01:34:13.897 --> 01:34:15.797
What are you saying, Gumustekin Bey?

01:34:19.630 --> 01:34:23.630
They have just left nomad group
safe and sound yesterday.

01:34:28.097 --> 01:34:31.197
A soldier who survived the attack
came to Seljuk headquarters

01:34:31.363 --> 01:34:33.430
and told us what happened.

01:34:38.363 --> 01:34:41.797
I could not believe what I have heard.
I personally went there.

01:34:45.497 --> 01:34:51.197
They slaughtered young boys
without hesitation!

01:34:59.663 --> 01:35:02.763
And Atabey Ertokus?

01:35:05.463 --> 01:35:08.397
He was not there.
It seems that they captured him.

01:35:23.297 --> 01:35:27.230
Who is responsible for this
contemptibleness? Mongols?

01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:32.130
I wish they were, Bey.

01:35:33.230 --> 01:35:34.830
I wish they were
so we would console ourselves

01:35:35.197 --> 01:35:36.630
by thinking their shahada.

01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:46.263
Who then? Who was it then?

01:35:48.463 --> 01:35:51.897
Talk to us, man!
Do not go all round the houses!

01:35:52.463 --> 01:35:54.363
Who did this contemptibleness?

01:36:03.697 --> 01:36:05.363
Ertugrul and his Alps!

01:36:18.330 --> 01:36:19.763
Know your place, Gumustekin!

01:36:20.863 --> 01:36:22.297
Stop right there!

01:36:24.630 --> 01:36:27.863
The one who is saying that my son is
involved such contemptibleness

01:36:28.563 --> 01:36:30.497
must be looking for some disorder!

01:36:31.863 --> 01:36:33.730
I will make that person pay
for his slander.

01:36:35.497 --> 01:36:37.863
-No way! It must be a lie!
-It is a slander!

01:36:38.397 --> 01:36:40.163
Ertugrul Bey does not do that!

01:36:44.497 --> 01:36:48.863
Thank God, marquee customs and state
manners taught us our place, Mother Hayme.

01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:56.463
That soldier who survived says that
he saw Ertugrul.

01:36:56.663 --> 01:37:00.163
I also could not believe it. But then
I went there and saw with my eyes.

01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:02.397
What did you see?

01:37:40.130 --> 01:37:43.430
Kayis' arrows, Alps who died
and their weapons.

01:37:44.497 --> 01:37:47.263
You can go there if you wish
and see it with your eyes.

01:38:03.697 --> 01:38:08.497
12 Alps have betrayed us
and joined Noyan's army.

01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:12.397
It is obvious that these belong to them.

01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:17.563
My brother never involves
in such betrayal.

01:38:20.297 --> 01:38:25.497
Did this soldier see that Ertugrul Bey
do it and slander him?

01:38:28.230 --> 01:38:30.397
Yes, he personally saw it.

01:38:31.597 --> 01:38:34.297
That he was walking among wounded
and taking lives.

01:38:48.897 --> 01:38:50.130
I cannot believe it.

01:39:03.330 --> 01:39:05.597
Sultan's stooge Saadettin Kobek
was also there

01:39:05.797 --> 01:39:08.163
while soldier was telling about
what he saw.

01:39:14.297 --> 01:39:15.630
And this is his order.

01:39:22.297 --> 01:39:23.863
What does it say...

01:39:25.297 --> 01:39:26.563
...Bey?

01:39:34.230 --> 01:39:36.730
Ertugrul will be slaughtered
as he is seen.

01:39:41.497 --> 01:39:42.763
That is enough!

01:39:43.863 --> 01:39:45.330
Enough!

01:39:52.630 --> 01:39:54.297
I will find the truth behind it.

01:39:55.730 --> 01:39:58.730
My son is about to victim of a slander.

01:39:59.663 --> 01:40:01.563
I will never let it happen.

01:41:08.263 --> 01:41:10.163
Gumustekin is not a random man, mother.

01:41:10.263 --> 01:41:12.630
He is an important commander
who has served for Alaeddin.

01:41:13.163 --> 01:41:15.163
I do not care about who he is, son.

01:41:16.263 --> 01:41:20.263
Nobody can convince me that
Ertugrul killed them.

01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:23.097
And capturing Ertokus?

01:41:24.163 --> 01:41:27.797
They fought against Mongols together.
They are friends from war.

01:41:28.297 --> 01:41:30.130
They are lying. Lying.

01:41:30.330 --> 01:41:34.297
Mother, I will not believe
even if my brother would confess it.

01:41:35.130 --> 01:41:36.830
That's an obvious conspiracy for him.

01:41:37.497 --> 01:41:40.097
This conspiracy is not just for him,
it is for all of us.

01:41:42.297 --> 01:41:44.630
Mongols themselves
who organized this conspiracy.

01:41:46.297 --> 01:41:47.730
If what you said is true

01:41:48.130 --> 01:41:53.163
then Mongols' evil hand
reached out to the palace of Alaeddin.

01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:06.630
-Is it true, mother?
-It is true, girl.

01:42:13.363 --> 01:42:20.363
Now palace's coyotes are trying to claw
my hero who has been left alone

01:42:22.497 --> 01:42:25.330
by his mother, father and nomad group?

01:42:29.363 --> 01:42:31.297
What do you know about it, Halime Sultan?

01:42:32.163 --> 01:42:34.230
All I know is this, Gundogdu Bey.

01:42:35.463 --> 01:42:38.297
You made him fell a prey to wolfs
and birds with his hand

01:42:38.530 --> 01:42:40.463
which can not hold a sword.

01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:46.297
You threw him away in front of Noyan.

01:43:01.663 --> 01:43:03.463
May good things happen to us.

01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:44.397
<i>To the people who establish states</i>
 <i>and who demolish states.</i>

01:43:45.230 --> 01:43:47.863
<i>Greetings from Artuk who is on duty.</i>

01:43:49.397 --> 01:43:52.397
<i>Things in Dodurga nomad group</i>
 <i>got completely mixed up.</i>

01:43:53.563 --> 01:43:56.730
<i>Ertugrul is accused by</i>
 <i>slaughtering of Ertokus.</i>

01:43:57.697 --> 01:44:01.630
<i>Artuk who is your eye that sees</i>
 <i>says that Ertugrul is innocent.</i>

01:44:02.597 --> 01:44:06.830
<i>Duty will be carried out when you order.</i>

01:44:31.597 --> 01:44:34.163
Come on, little bird.
It is time for you to fly.

01:44:44.197 --> 01:44:45.897
I will leave to collect herbs.
Get the horse.

01:45:19.297 --> 01:45:23.330
Gundogdu Bey is really important to us.
We must take him to our side.

01:45:23.563 --> 01:45:25.630
Do not offend him, brother.

01:45:31.863 --> 01:45:33.163
Father.

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:38.730
-Welcome.
-Greetings, girl.

01:45:40.463 --> 01:45:42.363
And as I told you

01:45:43.097 --> 01:45:46.197
Gundogdu is the best son-in-law
you would ever have, brother.

01:45:47.263 --> 01:45:51.430
He seems like a truthful person.
What if he gets in our way in the future?

01:45:55.097 --> 01:46:00.230
There is always a groom for
a beautiful lady like Goncagul, brother.

01:46:03.563 --> 01:46:05.163
What do you think, girl?

01:46:06.563 --> 01:46:08.497
I think just like my aunt, father.

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:14.497
He will be one of the closest brave guys
next to you when we got margrave.

01:46:24.630 --> 01:46:28.097
How much we can rely on
that soldier's words, Gumustekin?

01:46:29.163 --> 01:46:31.763
Ertugrul does not do such thing.
You also know that.

01:46:33.863 --> 01:46:36.463
I only rely on my eyes and state's order

01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:41.297
that Saadettin Kobek affixes a seal, Bey.

01:47:04.330 --> 01:47:07.163
I said that we should unite against enemy.

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:20.397
I have estranged my children,
my daughter-in-laws...

01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:26.763
...from myself one by one.

01:47:39.663 --> 01:47:40.863
Bey.

01:47:46.763 --> 01:47:53.097
Our nomad group is in pain
than ever before.

01:47:56.697 --> 01:48:00.097
Betrayals. Cruelty.

01:48:08.630 --> 01:48:11.530
It is not about unite after all.

01:48:14.263 --> 01:48:17.863
It is about becoming one heart.

01:48:20.897 --> 01:48:22.330
One heart.

01:48:25.630 --> 01:48:29.197
How will it happen
while our heart is bleeding?

01:48:40.763 --> 01:48:42.897
Mother. Are you okay, mother?

01:48:43.663 --> 01:48:45.897
I am fine. I am fine, son.

01:48:47.697 --> 01:48:50.763
If we do not find Ertugrul
and solve this situation

01:48:53.163 --> 01:48:54.863
Kayis will fall apart.

01:48:59.663 --> 01:49:01.697
If something happens to Ertugrul

01:49:03.730 --> 01:49:06.830
our nomad group and marquee
would collapse, mother.

01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:12.597
Mother.

01:49:14.230 --> 01:49:15.430
It is Halime.

01:49:16.130 --> 01:49:18.797
I cannot find her.
She took her horse and left.

01:50:06.197 --> 01:50:08.230
Bey, excuse us.

01:50:31.497 --> 01:50:34.663
What are you doing here, Halime?
We have talked about it.

01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:37.363
You were not supposed to be here.
It is too dangerous here.

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:40.430
Seljuk Empire released a statement
about you, Ertugrul.

01:50:46.563 --> 01:50:47.763
I knew it.

01:50:48.897 --> 01:50:50.463
Who had this information?

01:50:50.763 --> 01:50:53.597
Aytolun Hatun's brother. Gumustekin.

01:51:03.663 --> 01:51:04.730
Welcome, Bey.

01:51:09.130 --> 01:51:12.397
Gumustekin! I want to talk to you.

01:51:13.263 --> 01:51:15.163
Gundogdu, Gundogdu.

01:51:16.263 --> 01:51:17.830
I know that you are mad at me.

01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:21.597
I know your deceased father
and brother Ertugrul very well.

01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:23.630
I have loved and respected both.

01:51:24.297 --> 01:51:28.497
I have always witnessed
how they gave power to Oghuz.

01:51:29.130 --> 01:51:33.763
Then you should know that my brother
did not play a part in this.

01:51:34.730 --> 01:51:36.897
I want to believe that with all my heart.

01:51:37.330 --> 01:51:40.863
I have been praying to God so it
was not be like that since I heard it.

01:51:41.597 --> 01:51:46.230
Gumustekin, my brother is innocent
and I am going to prove this.

01:51:47.530 --> 01:51:51.197
Ertugrul will not be executed
without a trial. He could not be.

01:51:51.497 --> 01:51:53.197
Our state is not bandit.

01:51:54.363 --> 01:51:56.297
However if he would not be surrender
and walking in the mountains

01:51:56.463 --> 01:51:58.263
soldiers will capture him.

01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:01.330
Then I can not do anything.

01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:06.363
Do your job as his brother.

01:52:07.330 --> 01:52:09.097
Get him so he will stand trial.

01:52:09.597 --> 01:52:11.630
The sword of customs has no scabbard.

01:52:12.197 --> 01:52:14.763
He would get his reputation back
if he is innocent.

01:52:18.730 --> 01:52:21.663
It is the time for you
to be a brother, Gundogdu.

01:52:23.097 --> 01:52:25.897
Get him and bring him to justice.

01:52:58.763 --> 01:53:00.497
What will we do now, Ertugrul?

01:53:02.097 --> 01:53:04.497
How will we escape from this swamp?

01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:12.163
You do not worry, Halime Sultan.

01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:17.763
God is the greatest game spoiler.

01:53:18.663 --> 01:53:21.130
Every situation is against you, Ertugrul.

01:53:22.630 --> 01:53:24.363
You are accused of killing
soldiers of Seljuk Empire

01:53:24.563 --> 01:53:26.597
while we have Mongols evilness.

01:53:30.197 --> 01:53:34.863
Enemy always after me since I have set
my heart on this path, Halime Sultan.

01:53:35.863 --> 01:53:40.797
As long as they are after me
I will continue to be death of them.

01:53:45.230 --> 01:53:50.230
Bustle, fear, hopelessness are unmanly.

01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:56.397
Go back to your nomad group.

01:53:56.763 --> 01:53:58.863
Do not tell anyone that you talked to me.

01:53:59.463 --> 01:54:03.130
There is a traitor in nomad group.
Everybody should keep their eyes open.

01:54:05.130 --> 01:54:08.330
I will do my best
to reveal the truth, Ertugrul.

01:54:09.130 --> 01:54:13.163
But you should not keep me away
from yourself in this war you started.

01:54:15.297 --> 01:54:17.730
Let us become martyr together
if it is in our destiny.

01:54:22.197 --> 01:54:26.297
We remain separate on this world but
we shall come together on other world.

01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:29.730
Separation glorifies love, Halime Sultan.

01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:33.363
But destiny is in love with endeavour.

01:54:34.897 --> 01:54:38.663
We will endeavor so our enemies
will go down on their knees.

01:54:40.097 --> 01:54:43.530
We will endeavor
so traps will be collapsed.

01:54:44.530 --> 01:54:48.730
We will endeavor
so justice will be served.

01:55:06.897 --> 01:55:08.230
Loser!

01:55:09.463 --> 01:55:11.463
How did he slip through your fingers?

01:55:12.797 --> 01:55:17.197
Alps were there with their arrows!
I also got wounded!

01:55:18.363 --> 01:55:20.597
Why did not you get killed
and come back to me?

01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:22.563
So I kill you?

01:55:45.097 --> 01:55:47.697
Where is Ertokus?
What did happen to him?

01:55:48.597 --> 01:55:50.130
Ertokus is here, Bey.

01:55:52.363 --> 01:55:53.863
Let go! Let go!

01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:20.297
I have finally got you, Atabey Ertokus.

01:57:08.465 --> 01:57:09.598
Gundogdu Bey.

01:57:11.031 --> 01:57:12.165
I have read the order.

01:57:13.898 --> 01:57:19.231
It says that they will catch him and
take him to trial.

01:57:20.031 --> 01:57:22.898
And if he resists it is permitted
to kill him.

01:57:23.131 --> 01:57:24.131
I know that.

01:57:24.598 --> 01:57:26.031
I have talked to your father.

01:57:27.631 --> 01:57:28.831
Gundogdu Bey.

01:57:30.131 --> 01:57:33.998
My father devoted his life to
his state and the union of Oghuzs.

01:57:35.465 --> 01:57:39.998
He will never ignore justice against
Ertugrul Bey and Kayis.

01:57:40.631 --> 01:57:41.965
You believe my father.

01:57:43.265 --> 01:57:46.931
He is the only person who will
solve this matter justly.

01:57:48.665 --> 01:57:51.098
Or none of us can ben sure
what will happen next.

01:57:52.965 --> 01:57:56.998
You should know that I believe with all
my heart that Ertugrul Bey is innocent.

01:57:58.631 --> 01:57:59.931
Thank you.

01:58:26.498 --> 01:58:28.098
I have talked to Gumustekin, mother.

01:58:30.998 --> 01:58:31.998
Halime.

01:58:34.798 --> 01:58:35.998
Where are you coming from?

01:58:40.965 --> 01:58:42.265
I strolled with my horse, mother.

01:58:49.998 --> 01:58:54.231
I do not know why but I think
you are coming from Ertugrul.

01:59:01.864 --> 01:59:02.998
Halime Sultan.

01:59:03.631 --> 01:59:06.898
If you want me to save my brother
from this trouble

01:59:08.631 --> 01:59:10.731
you need to tell me where he is.

01:59:14.631 --> 01:59:16.965
Where is Ertugrul? Tell me the truth.

01:59:26.765 --> 01:59:27.831
Halime.

01:59:29.565 --> 01:59:33.465
If we cannot find Ertugrul
matters will get out of our hands.

01:59:36.131 --> 01:59:40.665
Tell me, so that I can go talk to him
and to find a solution.

01:59:41.631 --> 01:59:43.165
If you know his location
and do not tell us

01:59:43.865 --> 01:59:47.631
you would be sending him
to the gallows with your own hands.

01:59:51.531 --> 01:59:54.231
You should have thought about this
before you threw him in dark pits.

01:59:57.865 --> 02:00:01.965
If you want to know where he is,
he is everywhere in order to protect

02:00:02.131 --> 02:00:05.798
his nomad group not just from Noyan,
but also from your faults.

02:00:09.631 --> 02:00:12.698
He is in every tree hole,
under every rock.

02:00:14.665 --> 02:00:18.531
As long as Ertugrul is alive
then there is hope for Kayi tribe.

02:00:21.031 --> 02:00:22.965
If something happens to him

02:00:25.098 --> 02:00:26.898
our hopes will run out, Gundogdu Bey.

02:00:32.698 --> 02:00:33.765
Excuse me.

02:00:42.865 --> 02:00:44.098
Don't you worry, mother.

02:00:45.698 --> 02:00:47.031
I will find my brother.

02:00:49.598 --> 02:00:51.498
What did you talk with Gumustekin?

02:00:55.065 --> 02:00:57.031
He said that he will seek justice.

02:00:59.798 --> 02:01:05.131
That there will be a trial and he will
prove that Ertugrul is not guilty.

02:01:06.731 --> 02:01:10.665
Justice? Whose justice is it?

02:01:13.531 --> 02:01:16.865
Gundogdu, you are still talking
about justice in front of me.

02:01:50.665 --> 02:01:51.831
What do you think, Hamza?

02:01:53.998 --> 02:01:57.131
Did Abdurrahman Alp prove himself?

02:02:04.031 --> 02:02:05.031
He did.

02:02:06.531 --> 02:02:08.865
He now deserves to be your warrior.

02:02:09.798 --> 02:02:11.165
Hamza!

02:02:12.598 --> 02:02:14.998
You just as clueless as your Bey Gundogdu.

02:02:16.065 --> 02:02:17.598
But still

02:02:17.931 --> 02:02:21.631
Abdurrahman bested
my most trusted men one by one.

02:02:37.231 --> 02:02:42.265
Ertokus. Grasshopper jumps
only twice before he finds trouble.

02:02:43.731 --> 02:02:45.898
You fell on my lap on your third time.

02:02:47.565 --> 02:02:51.465
I know about the traitor that old man
put next to Ogeday.

02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:55.131
Go to hell, you wretched snake.

02:02:55.665 --> 02:02:59.231
Ogeday will send Sungurtekin's head
to me in wax.

02:03:00.165 --> 02:03:03.565
I will put Sungurtekin's head
to their nomad group's entrance.

02:03:04.598 --> 02:03:07.131
I thought rotten head
would not be useful for me.

02:03:08.198 --> 02:03:13.131
I want his mother and siblings
to recognise Sungurtekin's head.

02:03:13.598 --> 02:03:15.764
You will never take
those you want from me.

02:03:16.165 --> 02:03:20.565
I will not yield Sungurtekin's and
Seljuk Empire's war plans.

02:03:20.731 --> 02:03:23.498
I already got what I want, Ertokus.

02:03:24.731 --> 02:03:26.665
I am going to send you to Ogeday.

02:03:29.265 --> 02:03:30.998
What will Sultan Alaeddin think

02:03:31.165 --> 02:03:36.131
when he finds out we have
his glorious commander?

02:03:48.465 --> 02:03:52.631
He will think that he has lost the war
before it even begins.

02:04:40.498 --> 02:04:42.631
I was able to convince Gundogdu
with my words.

02:04:43.231 --> 02:04:45.731
I will reach Ertugrul with his help.

02:04:46.565 --> 02:04:49.565
-And then?
-Ertugrul will get what he deserves.

02:04:51.265 --> 02:04:52.665
A greasy noose.

02:04:56.565 --> 02:04:57.565
Gumustekin.

02:04:59.931 --> 02:05:02.065
What do you want from my son?

02:05:02.231 --> 02:05:03.498
What's the matter with you?

02:05:03.765 --> 02:05:05.798
-Hayme Hatun...
-Shut up, Aytolun!

02:05:06.631 --> 02:05:07.765
Sister Hayme.

02:05:18.098 --> 02:05:19.631
Listen to me carefully, brother.

02:05:20.131 --> 02:05:21.631
And you, too, Gumustekin.

02:05:22.865 --> 02:05:25.931
My son is not responsible of
these murders.

02:05:27.198 --> 02:05:30.931
I will never believe your written order
or your words

02:05:31.498 --> 02:05:34.465
before hearing it from him myself.

02:05:35.765 --> 02:05:37.565
If you persist...

02:05:38.865 --> 02:05:42.965
...and torture the people
and Beys of my tribe...

02:05:43.131 --> 02:05:44.965
...in hopes of finding something...

02:05:46.131 --> 02:05:48.565
...Kayis will leave here tomorrow.

02:05:52.998 --> 02:05:58.598
We will resist the armies of Gog and Magog
in this dead of winter

02:05:59.465 --> 02:06:03.665
just like we have resisted
our enemies for 1000 years.

02:06:04.965 --> 02:06:06.531
Just so you know!

02:06:08.065 --> 02:06:09.198
Mother Hayme.

02:06:12.931 --> 02:06:16.065
I have the order from
The Great Seljuk Empire.

02:06:22.031 --> 02:06:25.798
The Empire can keep it's decree,
as long as we have the mountains.

02:06:26.931 --> 02:06:30.065
Tell that to Sadettin Kobek.

02:08:27.231 --> 02:08:29.131
What kind of a wedding
you want, my gazelle?

02:08:30.865 --> 02:08:33.031
-I never thought of it.
-How come?

02:08:33.965 --> 02:08:36.165
How can a woman
not think about her wedding?

02:08:36.865 --> 02:08:38.165
I have not.

02:08:39.531 --> 02:08:41.031
Then you should immediately.

02:08:42.131 --> 02:08:45.465
We should start the preparations.
Tribes' Beys around here will attend.

02:08:46.765 --> 02:08:49.931
If God permits.
I will think about it, do not worry.

02:08:55.465 --> 02:08:57.765
-I want to ask something.
-Anything, my gazelle.

02:09:00.198 --> 02:09:02.498
What will happen to Ertugrul?

02:09:04.531 --> 02:09:06.898
What is it to you, Gokce!
What is it to you!

02:09:09.665 --> 02:09:11.798
Is that what you ask
after what I have told you?

02:09:16.631 --> 02:09:18.231
I was just curious.

02:09:18.865 --> 02:09:22.898
You know that Ertugrul
is like a brother to me.

02:09:23.098 --> 02:09:28.131
From now on, you have no right to be
curious about Ertugrul. Okay?

02:09:46.531 --> 02:09:48.865
If God permits, Tugtekin
will take good care of Gokce.

02:09:52.098 --> 02:09:53.931
I hope they will be happy.

02:09:54.265 --> 02:09:55.565
If God permits.

02:09:55.898 --> 02:09:58.631
If God permits this marriage
will bring peace to our tribe.

02:09:58.798 --> 02:10:02.098
If God permits, Bey.
However with Tugtekin's ambition

02:10:02.265 --> 02:10:04.531
there will not be any peace
for sister Gokce.

02:10:10.898 --> 02:10:12.231
-Bey.
-Abdurrahman.

02:10:28.665 --> 02:10:32.231
I made it, Bey. Noyan trusts me.

02:10:36.598 --> 02:10:41.931
But they killed soldiers from Seljuk
in front of my eyes, Bey.

02:10:47.731 --> 02:10:49.131
I couldn't do anything.

02:10:55.165 --> 02:10:57.565
Your duty was the hardest, Abdurrahman.

02:10:58.765 --> 02:11:00.631
If you can handle it...

02:11:03.798 --> 02:11:06.831
...you may save the lives of
thousands of Alps.

02:11:17.565 --> 02:11:18.831
Where is Ertokus Bey?

02:11:18.998 --> 02:11:21.531
I have delivered him to Noyan with Hamza.

02:11:22.031 --> 02:11:24.231
They will leave tomorrow
to take him to Ogeday.

02:11:34.065 --> 02:11:35.665
Go back quickly, Abdurrahman.

02:11:35.831 --> 02:11:38.698
If they feel your absence
they may get suspicious.

02:11:40.265 --> 02:11:42.631
-There is one more thing, Bey.
-Say it.

02:11:43.631 --> 02:11:45.131
Your brother Sungurtekin.

02:11:51.064 --> 02:11:53.798
-They are also talking about him.
-What do they say?

02:11:55.165 --> 02:11:57.064
They found out that he is a traitor.

02:11:58.631 --> 02:12:00.131
They sent a message to Ogeday.

02:12:00.598 --> 02:12:02.998
Sungurtekin? What is going on, Bey?

02:12:06.031 --> 02:12:07.498
Get ready, Alps.

02:12:07.898 --> 02:12:09.698
We are going to get Ertokus Bey.

02:13:38.731 --> 02:13:40.798
In the name of God!

02:16:31.231 --> 02:16:33.098
You are here just in time again
Ertugrul Bey.

02:16:34.198 --> 02:16:35.631
Thank God we met again.

02:16:38.798 --> 02:16:41.165
-Are you alright, Ertokus Bey?
-Of course!

02:16:41.765 --> 02:16:44.465
Noyan is more powerful than we thought.

02:16:45.731 --> 02:16:49.098
Our enemy should be powerful
for us to show our might.
