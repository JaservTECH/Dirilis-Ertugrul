00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 34 will start after 12:01 min.

12:01.242 --> 12:05.242
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:06.677 --> 12:10.344
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:10.610 --> 12:13.777
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

14:25.325 --> 14:26.892
I know the fire in you, mother.

14:29.958 --> 14:33.925
My heart burns, Gundogdu.

14:38.025 --> 14:40.192
I sent your brother to Mongol

14:41.558 --> 14:43.525
while he could not grab a sword.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.325
What if he is taken prisoner?

14:47.958 --> 14:50.492
What if he is wasted?
-May God forbid.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.992
You know, my brother is hard to kill.

14:55.192 --> 14:57.092
He will get over this, as well.

15:02.258 --> 15:03.325
If God permits, son.

15:05.258 --> 15:06.258
If God permits.

15:08.925 --> 15:10.225
Calm yourself down, mother.

15:11.192 --> 15:13.358
Every trouble's remedy comes from God.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.825
I wish I had been speechless
and would not have said it.

17:03.525 --> 17:06.058
You could not escape this time, Ertugrul.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.158
Split up! Search the area! Come on!

17:11.825 --> 17:12.825
Come on!

17:36.925 --> 17:37.925
<i>Treacherous dogs!</i>

17:40.192 --> 17:42.192
<i>I am the new Bey of nomad tent, Ertugrul.</i>

17:42.992 --> 17:44.425
<i>From now on, you will obey me.</i>

18:02.292 --> 18:03.992
Here! He is here!

18:42.458 --> 18:45.492
Halime, wipe your tears.

18:47.358 --> 18:49.458
Do not let your troubles burden your baby.

18:52.225 --> 18:55.225
My baby suffers even before he is born.

18:58.792 --> 19:01.492
He met fires of hell
even before he is born.

19:06.525 --> 19:09.058
Ertugrul Bey will come back soon.

19:09.992 --> 19:11.558
Mother Hayme will forgive him.

19:12.292 --> 19:15.392
How could a mother exile his own son
from his nomad tent?

19:16.258 --> 19:17.258
How?

19:18.825 --> 19:20.825
Ertugrul's hand has not healed yet.

19:23.025 --> 19:24.525
He has not put himself together yet.

19:26.325 --> 19:28.892
While we have so many enemies
how could a mother

19:29.525 --> 19:32.258
send his son to his death, Selcan?

19:33.225 --> 19:36.492
Mother Hayme talked with rage, Halime.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.358
She must show her rage to her brother.

19:39.425 --> 19:42.858
To her brother's mealy-mouthed wife.
What is my man's fault?

19:43.058 --> 19:44.425
-Halime.
-What is his sin?

19:49.492 --> 19:50.792
Halime, stop. Where are you going?

19:51.958 --> 19:53.292
Let me go, Selcan Hatun.

19:54.292 --> 19:56.225
I will show my rage now.
-Halime.

20:00.058 --> 20:01.058
Mother Hayme!

20:02.425 --> 20:03.425
Mother Hayme!

20:05.325 --> 20:08.192
How could you exile your son
from nomad tent?

20:09.025 --> 20:10.125
How could you say it?

20:11.492 --> 20:14.492
How could you consent to leave me
without my husband

20:15.392 --> 20:17.058
and my baby without his father?

20:21.158 --> 20:22.158
My daughter.

20:31.558 --> 20:32.892
What are you saying?

20:33.892 --> 20:35.525
I say a lot if you understand.

21:10.025 --> 21:11.025
He could not go far.

21:14.392 --> 21:16.058
So you want to play a game.

21:18.825 --> 21:20.125
You will have one, Ertugrul.

21:21.025 --> 21:22.025
Move!

21:34.592 --> 21:39.358
You send your son, Ertugrul,
to hell Mother Hayme!

21:39.792 --> 21:43.525
Halime, do you hear what you are saying?

21:44.058 --> 21:45.058
Me?

21:48.792 --> 21:51.292
You stopped asking for help
in Korkut's tent

21:52.058 --> 21:54.025
and now you are giving us
advice, Gundogdu Bey.

21:54.192 --> 21:55.258
Know your place!

21:57.592 --> 22:01.892
Who are you to talk against
Mother Hayme and Gundogdu Bey?

22:03.958 --> 22:08.192
Go to your marquee and wait for your man.

22:09.158 --> 22:10.158
Now!

22:15.158 --> 22:16.158
Mother Hayme!

22:20.225 --> 22:21.292
Raise her, Bey.

22:28.325 --> 22:29.325
Raise her, Bey!

22:29.992 --> 22:30.992
Mother!

22:36.258 --> 22:37.258
Mother.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.792
Come now, jackals.

24:10.358 --> 24:12.492
He is weak, stay sharp.

24:46.592 --> 24:47.592
Tankut.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.592
This way.

24:54.958 --> 24:56.058
So let us go, Hamza.

25:16.792 --> 25:17.792
What are we going to do?

25:19.325 --> 25:21.425
Son of Suleyman Shah, Ertugrul!

25:23.592 --> 25:25.225
You could not escape!

25:28.225 --> 25:29.225
Split up.

25:29.858 --> 25:31.925
You, that way! You, this way!

25:32.292 --> 25:33.592
You, follow me! Come on!

25:41.092 --> 25:42.225
The prey is ambushed.

26:10.410 --> 26:11.610
She carries the burden of nomad tent.

26:13.777 --> 26:15.677
Hayme Hatun has the blues.

26:16.810 --> 26:19.844
Immediately, you shall free
your heart from that grief.

26:22.610 --> 26:28.510
How could I bear all this grief and pain?

26:29.377 --> 26:32.710
You could, mother, with permission of God.

26:37.144 --> 26:39.310
Mix this with water and make a syrup.

26:40.244 --> 26:42.410
If God permits, this will heal her.

26:45.444 --> 26:47.644
-If you excuse me.
-Let me see you out.

26:48.844 --> 26:50.644
Pack up equipment and follow me.

27:00.310 --> 27:01.844
May God bless you, Artuk Bey.

27:02.777 --> 27:04.110
Take care of your mother, Bey.

27:05.710 --> 27:09.310
My mother lives in grief, pain and worry.

27:10.710 --> 27:13.310
May God not let anything happen to her.
-Amen.

27:22.644 --> 27:24.844
We need you, Mother Hayme.

27:28.510 --> 27:30.044
Do not die, please.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.144
You tousled nomad tent

28:00.477 --> 28:02.777
many men fall martyr because of you

28:03.710 --> 28:05.410
you ruined Ertugrul

28:06.110 --> 28:07.277
now you want to ruin Mother Hayme!

28:12.510 --> 28:16.110
If something happens to Mother Hayme,
I will kill you myself.

31:49.710 --> 31:52.410
God damn it! God damn it!

31:53.310 --> 31:54.377
Find him!

31:54.710 --> 31:56.177
Find him!

31:56.710 --> 31:57.710
Go!

32:12.410 --> 32:15.244
Find the men you left as guards
and punish them one by one.

32:16.410 --> 32:17.410
Do you understand?

32:21.577 --> 32:23.044
Ertugrul was always on my sight, Bey.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.644
It is impossible that
he would free Abdurrahman.

32:27.677 --> 32:28.744
What about his Alps?

32:29.710 --> 32:32.810
His Alps did not come to tent, Bey.
They were in their tent.

32:34.477 --> 32:35.710
I made them followed all day long.

32:36.777 --> 32:38.710
So how did this man escape?

32:40.044 --> 32:43.044
Bey, there are wheels within wheels.

32:43.710 --> 32:47.244
It is obvious that someone who is jealous
of you and Tugtekin did this.

32:48.177 --> 32:51.044
Someone discredits your dignity.

32:51.310 --> 32:53.277
Unfortunately, they succeeded it.

32:54.310 --> 32:55.444
I will go and find them.

32:56.044 --> 32:58.844
Tugtekin, you should not go anywhere.

33:00.077 --> 33:02.244
This should not be inextricable.

33:02.844 --> 33:04.210
You should stay in nomad tent.

33:05.310 --> 33:09.544
Kacabash, take your best Alps,
set out and follow them.

33:10.444 --> 33:14.310
Find Abdurrahman, Ertugrul and his Alps
then bring them back.

33:15.377 --> 33:16.377
Now!

33:19.377 --> 33:20.710
Go and find them.

33:22.144 --> 33:24.744
Find them and show no mercy.

33:25.577 --> 33:26.644
Do not worry, Bey.

33:28.144 --> 33:31.344
If you do not find them, I will whip you
in nomad tent, Kocabash.

33:33.210 --> 33:34.210
Go now.

34:49.277 --> 34:51.344
You stay here, and you two come with me.

36:33.210 --> 36:34.477
Move. Move!

36:46.710 --> 36:52.344
If I do not kill you and your loved ones

36:53.377 --> 36:55.077
may Earth has my blood!

36:56.744 --> 36:57.744
Move!

37:18.044 --> 37:20.244
Look what I have become thanks to you
while I am a doctor.

37:21.110 --> 37:22.344
How can I make it up to you, Bey.

37:23.544 --> 37:24.710
Thank to Turali.

37:27.377 --> 37:29.110
Now, put these on.

37:32.177 --> 37:33.177
But, Artuk Bey...

37:34.210 --> 37:36.577
...the only thing I did not do
was wearing woman clothes.

37:37.177 --> 37:40.577
How did you imagine your escape
in day time from nomad tent?

37:42.377 --> 37:45.444
Come on, don't push it. Put these on.

38:00.644 --> 38:04.377
Abdurrahman, Ertugrul Bey and his Alps,
Dogan and Turgut

38:05.410 --> 38:06.644
whoever comes across

38:07.710 --> 38:09.277
we are assigned to take them
to nomad tent.

38:11.344 --> 38:12.810
If they fight back, you can kill them.

38:14.510 --> 38:17.077
This is headquarters' judgment.
-Where are we going?

38:18.844 --> 38:19.844
Make the preparations.

38:20.677 --> 38:21.744
I go to Artuk Bey.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.210
Go out, Turali. Have a look around.

38:44.077 --> 38:47.144
Your horse is ready.
You will go to Geyikli's cave.

38:47.710 --> 38:49.277
Turali will take you to horse.

38:50.377 --> 38:52.610
Thank you, Bey. May god bless you.

39:00.377 --> 39:01.377
<i>Come on, hurry up.</i>

39:25.644 --> 39:26.644
Peace be upon you, Bey.

39:27.777 --> 39:29.344
And peace be upon you, Kocabash.

39:37.477 --> 39:38.477
What is the matter?

39:40.644 --> 39:42.677
Do you understand how could
Abdurrahman escape

39:43.677 --> 39:46.377
because his body was not around?

39:48.077 --> 39:51.077
While Alps like you who have their mind
on other thing are on duty

39:52.277 --> 39:55.177
more treachers will escape, Kocabash.

40:06.644 --> 40:10.110
I am here to take some more syrup
which you prepared for Mother Hayme.

40:10.344 --> 40:11.744
I will make it ready, Selcan Hatun.

40:17.310 --> 40:18.710
Do you need anything, Kocabash?

40:20.344 --> 40:21.344
No, Bey.

40:22.277 --> 40:23.277
If you excuse me.

40:39.544 --> 40:41.044
Do not rush anymore, mother.

40:41.844 --> 40:44.610
We will get over this trouble
with God's help.

40:47.077 --> 40:49.844
My self-sacrificing and smart son.

40:51.177 --> 40:52.210
If God permits.

40:53.077 --> 40:54.143
If God permits.

40:55.277 --> 40:56.610
<i>Permission, Mother Hayme!</i>

40:57.677 --> 40:58.744
Come in, Dumrul.

41:07.510 --> 41:11.144
Kocabash gathered Alps they will
go after them, Mother Hayme.

41:12.077 --> 41:13.777
It is obvious they will fight.

41:14.344 --> 41:17.110
They thought Ertugrul Bey
freed Abdurrahman, mother.

41:17.644 --> 41:18.677
What did you say?

41:20.244 --> 41:22.477
Mother! You are tired,
let me talk to my uncle.

41:22.644 --> 41:26.777
It is enough, it is time to bring them
into the line!

41:27.377 --> 41:31.077
What does going after my son mean
even after I exiled my son?

41:32.144 --> 41:33.377
Do they want to kill him?

41:49.110 --> 41:50.110
Ertugrul!

42:02.444 --> 42:04.244
How much lucre did you take to betray
your nomad tent, treacherous dog?

42:06.410 --> 42:07.610
I was innocent, Ertugrul.

42:08.444 --> 42:10.244
Your brother, Gundogdu,
did not believe in me.

42:11.144 --> 42:12.477
He accused me of being a treacher.

42:13.277 --> 42:16.410
I fight to death for him
without batting an eyelid.

42:18.310 --> 42:19.677
I thought of him as a father.

42:22.177 --> 42:23.344
I did not deserve this.

42:24.377 --> 42:27.210
Did you become Noyan's dog
because of what Gundogdu Bey did?

42:48.477 --> 42:49.777
Ertugrul!

43:08.177 --> 43:10.177
I will make you regret
the day you were born!

43:17.610 --> 43:18.610
Archer!

43:37.644 --> 43:38.644
Archer!

43:51.044 --> 43:52.277
It is not going to work, Bey.

43:53.810 --> 43:55.744
Two nomad tents could not bear this pain.

43:57.110 --> 44:01.777
Flames that Ertugrul put us in will burn
all of us sooner or later.

44:04.577 --> 44:08.177
His mother exiled him. He is gone now.

44:11.210 --> 44:12.244
What if...

44:13.844 --> 44:15.377
...Hayme did it?

44:20.110 --> 44:22.210
Do you hear yourself, woman?

44:25.677 --> 44:28.644
She would have lost her
reputation among Alps

44:29.177 --> 44:31.810
if she had wasted her husband reminder?

44:32.644 --> 44:33.810
Perhaps, she was afraid of it.

44:34.710 --> 44:36.144
She did it herself.

44:37.777 --> 44:42.377
She silenced us by exiling Ertugrul.

45:31.177 --> 45:32.577
You showed that you are a Kayi mother

45:33.177 --> 45:35.544
by showing no mercy
to your son, Mother Hayme.

45:37.644 --> 45:44.444
I am a mother but my brother is
neither an uncle nor a Bey, Aytolun.

45:49.310 --> 45:52.244
Korkut Bey knows how to behave, Hayme.

45:54.077 --> 45:55.144
Look at me, Aytolun.

45:56.277 --> 46:01.777
Do not ever try to be The Bey's wife
in my father's nomad tent.

46:05.077 --> 46:06.844
I send you where you came from.

46:17.477 --> 46:21.310
So, not every dog barks in his own yard.

47:01.277 --> 47:03.510
If God permits, we will
get over these hard times.

47:57.810 --> 48:01.244
You sent your Alps
after my son and his Alps.

48:02.810 --> 48:06.044
Like a treacher, a murderer, a bandit!

48:09.577 --> 48:11.477
They said you sent men after him.

49:29.144 --> 49:30.810
What would I have done, Hayme?

49:33.044 --> 49:36.544
My duty is performing
headquarters' judgment

49:37.210 --> 49:38.777
and keeping the peace in nomad tent,
is not it?

49:41.310 --> 49:44.277
So, you will bring peace by fratricide.

49:46.544 --> 49:48.444
If they are not involved in this

49:49.610 --> 49:53.710
they will come after my Alp
and we will talk about it.

49:54.344 --> 49:58.644
Or, if they disobey headquarters'
judgments and freed Abdurrahman

49:59.544 --> 50:02.644
then they will pay the price
according to traditions.

50:05.644 --> 50:08.744
You are making a mistake, brother.
You are making a mistake.

50:10.544 --> 50:14.277
If any of them gets hurt,
I will make you pay for it!

50:31.744 --> 50:32.744
What's happening, father?

50:34.844 --> 50:38.810
Your aunt is offended because we sent men
after treachers, Tugtekin.

50:41.344 --> 50:43.277
We welcomed them for a long time, aunt.

50:44.610 --> 50:46.044
They freed Abdurrahman.

50:47.744 --> 50:49.577
Have not you fed up living
with treachers yet?

50:52.110 --> 50:55.577
Stop Tugtekin, do not fan the fire.

51:00.744 --> 51:01.744
Uncle.

51:03.144 --> 51:04.177
Mother.

51:04.444 --> 51:05.777
We assembled the headquarters here.

51:06.577 --> 51:09.444
We said we would be one and united.

51:10.844 --> 51:11.844
We gave our words.

51:13.510 --> 51:14.577
So what is this situation now?

51:15.544 --> 51:17.377
We are down at the first shot.

51:19.277 --> 51:20.577
But it was obvious.

51:26.310 --> 51:27.344
We said, son.

51:29.210 --> 51:30.310
Yes, we said.

51:31.077 --> 51:36.844
But I exiled my helpless son
from nomad tent.

51:37.710 --> 51:40.177
What does sending men after him mean?

51:42.544 --> 51:46.077
I put my nomad tent
in enough danger, Hayme.

51:48.310 --> 51:49.477
I shared my tent with you.

51:51.244 --> 51:52.510
But I am at the end of my rope.

51:53.510 --> 51:56.677
Those traitors will come here
sooner or later.

52:01.177 --> 52:03.077
All right, then find them.

52:04.377 --> 52:07.610
I hope you are not get
involved in this, Hayme.

52:46.277 --> 52:48.377
Mother Hayme knows what happened.

52:49.077 --> 52:51.444
But she is silent not to stir nomad tent.

52:52.644 --> 52:54.244
Whatever.
-Have a nice day.

53:00.110 --> 53:03.677
Ertugrul Bey is exiled by his mother
as he deserved...

53:06.344 --> 53:08.477
....so there will be peace
in our nomad tents.

53:09.110 --> 53:10.310
Is not it, Wild Demir?

53:11.044 --> 53:14.710
If you stick your heads in the sand,
there will be no peace, Aytolun Hatun.

53:15.644 --> 53:17.477
While the trouble comes right at us

53:18.210 --> 53:21.277
you left no peace in nomad tent
by saying peace.

53:26.144 --> 53:29.544
We know who dreamt of war
with his lame hand.

53:34.410 --> 53:38.310
Many perished in battle field like jades.

53:40.710 --> 53:44.077
Battle is not performed
only with sword, Aytolun Hatun.

53:44.610 --> 53:46.044
But with heart and word.

53:46.744 --> 53:49.810
Ertugrul Bey said what he thought.

53:50.544 --> 53:56.477
But you are so deaf, blind
and even black hearted that...

53:56.644 --> 53:57.744
Enough, Wild Demir.

54:00.744 --> 54:01.744
Enough.

54:07.377 --> 54:10.044
I thought your duty was to forge the iron.

54:11.077 --> 54:13.444
But you could not hold your tongue.

54:15.344 --> 54:16.377
Shame on you.

54:22.610 --> 54:23.844
She is worse than snake.

54:25.377 --> 54:28.110
She gets suspicious.
She sees how the wind blows.

54:29.844 --> 54:33.044
Be careful about her and your words.

54:34.410 --> 54:36.177
We should not be seen together.

54:37.144 --> 54:39.244
You speak the truth, Bey.
You speak the truth.

55:04.410 --> 55:05.677
Where are they, Turgut brother?

55:06.177 --> 55:08.210
Ertugrul Bey said they will come after us.

55:08.377 --> 55:09.644
So, why are not they here yet?

55:10.477 --> 55:12.044
What if something happened to Abdurrahman

55:12.210 --> 55:13.510
while they were freeing him
from caged tent?

55:14.244 --> 55:16.210
Dogan, enough.

55:20.744 --> 55:23.477
You are right, Turgut brother. I am sorry.

55:52.144 --> 55:53.144
Abdurrahman?

55:53.310 --> 55:56.077
What happened to you, Abdurrahman brother?
You are a woman.

55:59.577 --> 56:03.477
I saw a bird in forest.
He was flying around.

56:04.077 --> 56:06.310
I captured him and brought here
to poor's cave.

56:07.244 --> 56:08.810
The only thing I have not done
was putting on women's clothes

56:09.144 --> 56:10.177
but I did it at least.

56:11.444 --> 56:14.177
Brothers, there is no death
for us on land.

56:22.110 --> 56:23.110
Calm down, mother.

56:23.577 --> 56:26.810
Even if they follow Ertugrul,
they could not find him, do not worry.

56:27.377 --> 56:29.544
They cannot find neither Ertugrul
nor his Alps.

56:31.277 --> 56:33.444
I know they could not find him, Gundogdu.

56:33.810 --> 56:37.344
But, what does sending men
after my son mean?

56:39.677 --> 56:44.177
How could I accept the edict
that Korkut wrote about my son

56:44.410 --> 56:47.210
as a mother and Bey of this nomad tent?

56:49.477 --> 56:53.177
He sent his dogs after my son
because exiling him was not enough.

56:53.577 --> 56:55.144
Tell me, Gundogdu!

56:56.277 --> 56:57.610
I exiled him myself.

56:58.077 --> 57:00.144
What should I have done, take his life?

57:01.344 --> 57:05.610
I do not know what is happening
but we both know Ertugrul.

57:06.377 --> 57:09.110
We know he disregards dangers.

57:12.110 --> 57:13.510
If he did it

57:14.710 --> 57:18.644
he saved both Kayis
and your father's honor.

57:21.377 --> 57:22.444
What are you saying, mother?

57:25.244 --> 57:26.644
Did not Ertugrul cause all these trouble

57:28.244 --> 57:32.310
by saying headquarters'
judgment and traditions?

57:33.810 --> 57:36.544
So, our headquarters and traditions
are worthless now?

57:37.510 --> 57:38.577
What is this?

57:38.844 --> 57:40.844
Perhaps, I should have said this
at the very beginning.

57:42.344 --> 57:46.144
I should have said this when we took
shelter in my brother's nomad tent.

57:47.344 --> 57:50.810
I made a huge mistake by accepting
my brothers offer! A huge mistake!

57:51.544 --> 57:55.210
-Mother!
-Go son, go Gundogdu!

58:12.277 --> 58:14.544
-Is there anything missing?
-No, Aytolun Hanim.

58:15.110 --> 58:18.544
All the preparations will be done
before merchant Efrasiyab arrives.

58:19.510 --> 58:20.510
Good.

58:27.444 --> 58:31.544
If your eyes are shining on a day
like this, you have good news.

58:32.277 --> 58:34.244
Gokce accepted to come Erzurum
with me, mother.

58:37.310 --> 58:38.577
This is good news.

58:39.844 --> 58:42.844
You will be together
until she will be in your bed.

58:44.777 --> 58:46.410
Call Gokce to our marquee tonight.

58:47.144 --> 58:49.510
Tell her that my mother and father
want to have a dinner with her.

58:52.210 --> 58:53.310
Do you understand?

58:54.577 --> 58:55.610
I do, mother.

59:00.277 --> 59:06.144
Do not ever break Mother Hayme's heart
until hard times are over.

59:07.510 --> 59:10.477
She is the only one who can prevent you
from taking Gokce

59:10.844 --> 59:14.344
in your bed and as your wife.
Do not forget this.

59:16.044 --> 59:19.644
We got rid of Ertugrul one way or another.

59:21.410 --> 59:23.710
Hayme will sit in her corner
when the time is right.

59:25.044 --> 59:26.077
Then...

59:27.710 --> 59:30.844
...Dodurga and Kayi will not overcome...

59:32.644 --> 59:35.610
...as long as you and your father lead us.

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:23.077
He escaped again.

01:00:29.344 --> 01:00:31.477
As long as he escapes and I get bored.

01:00:38.644 --> 01:00:40.744
Do spirits tell me to let him alive?

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:48.210
As if I do not let him live

01:00:49.844 --> 01:00:51.777
everything will be in vein.

01:00:59.344 --> 01:01:01.044
What do spirits tell me, Ulubilge?

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:02.277
Ertugrul beat you severely.

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.277
Pray that I saved your life.

01:02:16.044 --> 01:02:18.044
What does Noyan do with shaman?

01:02:19.177 --> 01:02:20.210
He talks to spirits.

01:02:21.577 --> 01:02:23.644
He wants to know
what great spirits tell him.

01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:45.044
What do spirits say, Ulubilge?

01:02:55.077 --> 01:02:57.777
If Ertugrul is not murdered

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:01.777
the earth will be his.

01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:09.777
And his sons will conquer everywhere
what is on this world.

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:18.244
I will destroy him and everything
he will have.

01:03:20.377 --> 01:03:21.410
Everything.

01:03:51.577 --> 01:03:52.710
Ertugrul Bey is here.

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:54.644
Are you alright, Bey?

01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:00.410
Help me take this out.

01:04:11.177 --> 01:04:12.210
What happened, Bey?

01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:16.710
Tangut. He chased me with Hamza.

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:19.744
-Bastard!
-Rascal!

01:04:20.144 --> 01:04:21.310
They chased us, too.

01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:27.644
I am sure there is spy in nomad tent.

01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:30.110
They follow every step we take.

01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:39.310
Another Kurdoglu.

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:43.144
They ambushed us out of nomad tent

01:04:44.144 --> 01:04:46.277
while we were going to lay
an ambush to Noyan.

01:04:47.744 --> 01:04:52.510
He attacked you now so you are right, Bey.
There is a treacher in nomad tent.

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:55.644
We will not have peace until we find him.

01:04:58.044 --> 01:04:59.077
What will we do, Bey?

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:03.544
We have no nomad tent now.

01:05:04.677 --> 01:05:05.710
We have no Alps, too.

01:05:06.677 --> 01:05:09.610
We have only our swords and our hearts.

01:05:13.444 --> 01:05:17.410
Whether we will be a martyr
or we will take jackals' heads.

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:25.577
It is an honor to die by your side, Bey.

01:05:31.377 --> 01:05:33.844
So, listen to me carefully.

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:37.410
From now on, we will act as they deserve.

01:05:39.344 --> 01:05:40.344
How, Bey?

01:06:15.797 --> 01:06:17.431
Aytolun Hatun invited me to dinner.

01:06:18.231 --> 01:06:19.431
She has something to talk.

01:06:19.764 --> 01:06:21.464
Tell Mother Hayme I will go there.

01:06:31.897 --> 01:06:33.864
What will you do in that woman's meal
at the dead of night?

01:06:39.331 --> 01:06:40.964
I seek a piece of peace, sister.

01:06:42.497 --> 01:06:43.497
Just peace.

01:06:46.264 --> 01:06:49.997
To stay away from you, Halime.

01:06:51.897 --> 01:06:53.231
Do you begrudge me this?

01:07:02.764 --> 01:07:07.497
That woman's only desire is biting
our weakest link off, nothing else.

01:07:10.231 --> 01:07:12.297
What does Aytolun after, Selcan?

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:16.531
I will find out at all cost.

01:07:17.464 --> 01:07:20.631
I will not let her to take
my loved ones one by one.

01:08:09.864 --> 01:08:13.031
Grape molasses is sour.
It lost its flavor.

01:08:15.231 --> 01:08:17.997
Are you making up excuses
not to drink it, Bey?

01:08:19.964 --> 01:08:21.597
You will drink grape molasses

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:24.831
so you will attack your hunt
like a raging bull.

01:08:37.864 --> 01:08:39.331
You made me mad at this age.

01:08:42.264 --> 01:08:45.297
Raging bull will attack you tonight.

01:09:00.964 --> 01:09:02.997
-Our guest is here.
-Good evening, Bey.

01:09:03.531 --> 01:09:05.664
May I sit down?
-Welcome, daughter.

01:09:06.531 --> 01:09:07.664
Sit down.

01:09:27.631 --> 01:09:29.497
In the name of God.

01:09:33.831 --> 01:09:34.831
Enjoy it.

01:09:53.897 --> 01:09:54.964
Peace be upon you.

01:09:57.731 --> 01:09:59.431
No need, go on.

01:10:00.031 --> 01:10:01.464
Dumrul, help me.

01:10:22.964 --> 01:10:25.497
I want exact number of animals
tomorrow, Dumrul.

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:27.797
Cattle, small cattle, all of them.

01:10:28.831 --> 01:10:29.831
Yes, Bey.

01:10:33.631 --> 01:10:36.231
Count young animal that were born
in spring separately.

01:10:37.397 --> 01:10:39.831
I think we should not sell them
to the merchant.

01:10:41.597 --> 01:10:44.864
We will need them to augment
the herd after war.

01:10:45.797 --> 01:10:46.931
You heard my mother.

01:10:47.797 --> 01:10:48.797
Yes, Bey.

01:10:53.731 --> 01:10:55.831
-Here, Bey.
-Thank you.

01:11:00.831 --> 01:11:01.997
The meal is ready, mother.

01:11:40.331 --> 01:11:43.431
<i>God, thanks to you countless times.</i>

01:11:44.664 --> 01:11:46.264
<i>You re-united us.</i>

01:11:47.497 --> 01:11:51.231
<i>You did not leave our</i>
 <i>nomad tent to tyrant.</i>

01:11:51.897 --> 01:11:54.864
<i>Thanks to you, God.</i>
 <i>-Amen.</i>

01:11:57.931 --> 01:12:02.297
Once, we fed many people on our meal.

01:12:06.797 --> 01:12:08.631
If God permits, those day
will come again, mother.

01:12:10.564 --> 01:12:11.631
If God permits.

01:12:13.364 --> 01:12:14.531
Where is Halime?

01:12:16.697 --> 01:12:19.297
She is not hungry, mother. She is asleep.

01:12:21.497 --> 01:12:22.831
So, where is Gokce?

01:12:25.397 --> 01:12:27.797
Aytolun invited her to dinner.

01:12:29.531 --> 01:12:30.564
She went to marquee.

01:12:42.464 --> 01:12:46.564
If a family is not together in a meal

01:12:47.997 --> 01:12:50.631
that nomad tent and tribe are not united.

01:12:55.864 --> 01:13:00.031
I could neither be a mother
nor keep my nomad tent up.

01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:02.664
What are you saying, mother?

01:13:08.931 --> 01:13:10.964
It is obvious, beautiful eyed Selcan.

01:13:14.464 --> 01:13:17.031
If there is no peace in meal...

01:13:20.031 --> 01:13:21.297
...no one eat there.

01:13:24.997 --> 01:13:27.331
If there is no one, there is no unity.

01:13:49.297 --> 01:13:50.464
May God bless your hand, aunt.

01:13:52.764 --> 01:13:53.897
Thank you, Gokce.

01:14:01.597 --> 01:14:02.597
For so long...

01:14:04.797 --> 01:14:05.797
...I have never...

01:14:12.331 --> 01:14:14.864
Gokce, what happened?

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:22.031
Did we say something wrong?

01:14:25.264 --> 01:14:26.297
No, no.

01:14:29.764 --> 01:14:33.831
I have not had a peaceful meal
for so long.

01:14:38.897 --> 01:14:40.764
What you have gone through
was not easy, Gokce.

01:14:44.331 --> 01:14:46.431
Then, your brother, Ertugrul...

01:14:47.997 --> 01:14:49.531
...caused many troubles to you.

01:14:55.031 --> 01:14:59.964
Hayme made the right decision
for all of us by exiling him.

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:03.831
Isn't it, Gokce?

01:15:10.031 --> 01:15:11.297
You speak the truth, aunt.

01:15:21.531 --> 01:15:23.497
I hope he will not come back
with new troubles.

01:15:33.297 --> 01:15:37.897
Oghuz always found a way out
even in darkest times.

01:15:41.364 --> 01:15:44.297
Two nomad tents' merging
is a blessing of God.

01:15:46.397 --> 01:15:49.564
We must appreciate this blessing.

01:16:02.231 --> 01:16:05.897
Our merging is not limited
with Ertugrul, Korkut Bey.

01:16:09.997 --> 01:16:15.964
We must enhance the bound
between Kayis and Dodurgas.

01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:19.864
Then no one will take a stand against us.

01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:44.364
Meal is ready, Bey.

01:17:04.364 --> 01:17:05.464
Hope you like it?

01:17:21.764 --> 01:17:22.764
Did you, Bey?

01:17:31.364 --> 01:17:32.531
God bless your hand, Turgut brother.

01:17:33.997 --> 01:17:35.631
You did it better than Halime Sultan.

01:17:39.564 --> 01:17:42.697
Bey, if Halime Hatun hears that,
I get in trouble.

01:17:46.364 --> 01:17:49.364
Turgut brother, Aykiz Baci
thought you a lot.

01:18:09.631 --> 01:18:10.631
Sit down, brother.

01:18:18.797 --> 01:18:19.831
Sit down and have your meal.

01:18:32.664 --> 01:18:35.931
Aykiz Baci is not dead, Turgut brother.
She is always with us.

01:18:37.697 --> 01:18:38.764
She fell martyr.

01:18:40.764 --> 01:18:42.831
I know, Bey. I know.

01:18:44.797 --> 01:18:47.397
If you knew, you would not be sorry.

01:18:49.697 --> 01:18:52.031
If you knew, you would not be in pain.

01:18:55.864 --> 01:19:00.831
If God permits, you will fall martyr
one day and meet with her.

01:19:04.864 --> 01:19:05.864
If God permits.

01:19:09.897 --> 01:19:10.964
You speak the truth, Bey.

01:19:13.564 --> 01:19:14.697
You speak the truth.

01:19:18.464 --> 01:19:19.964
I will rip this pain out of my heart.

01:19:37.431 --> 01:19:38.697
What is the situation in nomad tent, Bey?

01:19:39.564 --> 01:19:40.697
They blamed you.

01:19:43.564 --> 01:19:44.564
They have a point.

01:19:54.031 --> 01:19:55.331
That is why I do not talk.

01:19:59.331 --> 01:20:00.464
We swore that we would lose

01:20:01.364 --> 01:20:04.864
our mothers, our lovers
and our heads for Islam.

01:20:11.264 --> 01:20:13.964
Now, we will pay a price for our swear.

01:20:15.497 --> 01:20:17.264
Korkut Bey's marquee
is troubled, too, Bey.

01:20:19.497 --> 01:20:20.764
My uncle lost his foresight.

01:20:22.964 --> 01:20:24.664
Tugtekin has crazy ideas.

01:20:25.897 --> 01:20:27.631
He is in love with Gokce.

01:20:31.964 --> 01:20:35.397
The leading eye of my uncle's marquee
is Aytolun Hatun.

01:20:37.931 --> 01:20:40.797
She is the root of all evil.

01:20:42.531 --> 01:20:47.864
They thought Ertugrul is after Noyan
so he could not realize what they do.

01:20:49.731 --> 01:20:51.497
They are mistaken, I could.

01:20:53.464 --> 01:20:54.464
I realize.

01:20:56.931 --> 01:21:01.364
Aytolun Hatun, on the one hand, tries to
take my brother Gundogdu to their sides

01:21:02.564 --> 01:21:06.264
on the other hand, she wants to marry
Tugtekin and Gokce.

01:21:08.664 --> 01:21:10.764
Why do they want to marry
Tugtekin and Gokce?

01:21:11.597 --> 01:21:13.797
Gokce Hatun cannot not have a baby.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:21.797
If Aytolun Hatun knows this secret,
she has a secret agenda.

01:21:26.564 --> 01:21:27.964
We will find out soon.

01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:33.964
From now on

01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:39.831
if someone tries to trap us, I will
crash his world about his ears.

01:21:57.364 --> 01:21:59.931
If you excuse me, now. It is late.

01:22:13.031 --> 01:22:14.397
Come back any time, daughter.

01:22:16.397 --> 01:22:18.364
Dear God did not give me a daughter.

01:22:19.397 --> 01:22:22.431
But be my daughter and bring joy
to our home.

01:22:23.564 --> 01:22:24.631
Thank you, Bey.

01:22:33.831 --> 01:22:34.997
I will walk you to your marquee.

01:22:36.697 --> 01:22:39.397
-Good evening.
-Good evening, my daughter.

01:22:57.397 --> 01:22:58.597
What happens next?

01:23:00.497 --> 01:23:03.697
Any girl wants to be with Tugtekin, Bey.

01:23:05.297 --> 01:23:07.964
We will understand on the way to Erzurum.

01:23:10.397 --> 01:23:14.031
Why do you want this marriage
too much, Aytolun?

01:23:15.831 --> 01:23:21.564
The problem of two nomad tents' merging
will be solved by marriage of these.

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:28.431
Kayi people's love will be assured by son
of Korkut Bey, Tugtekin. That is why.

01:23:31.031 --> 01:23:32.497
You are cunning.

01:24:04.297 --> 01:24:05.397
The winter here is severe.

01:24:08.797 --> 01:24:10.397
This winter will be hard for all of us.

01:24:17.397 --> 01:24:18.597
<i>What are you doing, Gokce?</i>

01:24:18.764 --> 01:24:22.964
<i>How could I bear to see you in the</i>
 <i>same marquee with my wife and child?</i>

01:24:23.297 --> 01:24:25.397
<i>How could I live with you</i>
 <i>like pangs of conscience?</i>

01:24:25.731 --> 01:24:26.731
Gokce?

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:31.364
-What?
-I said winter.

01:24:35.364 --> 01:24:37.364
If you are in peace with the ones you love

01:24:38.497 --> 01:24:39.831
no one cares about winter.

01:25:26.897 --> 01:25:27.931
Good night, aunt.

01:25:30.031 --> 01:25:31.364
You, too, Tugtekin.

01:25:35.031 --> 01:25:38.597
Why did not you tell me that
you go to dinner to Korkut Bey?

01:25:39.664 --> 01:25:41.231
I told my sister, Mother Hayme.

01:25:42.531 --> 01:25:44.264
Next time, tell me either, too.

01:25:47.631 --> 01:25:50.631
It is obvious that Korkut Bey
cares a lot for you.

01:25:57.264 --> 01:25:58.997
-Good night, Bey.
-Good night.

01:26:12.431 --> 01:26:16.831
You heard Kayi Alps are anxious.

01:26:19.397 --> 01:26:22.031
They are more anxious after Ertugrul left.

01:26:23.331 --> 01:26:24.597
I know, aunt. I know.

01:26:27.364 --> 01:26:31.597
They fought more battles
than any other Alps did.

01:26:33.564 --> 01:26:36.764
They always stood up against our enemies.

01:26:38.497 --> 01:26:44.231
I took my son's mission and entrusted
my Alps to you in battle field.

01:26:46.631 --> 01:26:48.464
Do not offend them ever again.

01:26:51.564 --> 01:26:54.431
Ertugrul brother is gone
so there will be no problem, aunt.

01:26:56.264 --> 01:26:58.931
We will find out treachers
sooner or later.

01:26:59.931 --> 01:27:05.897
I want you know, that I want to offend
neither you nor those brave men.

01:27:08.697 --> 01:27:12.031
I hope, you will not. Good night, son.

01:27:13.264 --> 01:27:14.331
Good night, aunt.

01:27:43.897 --> 01:27:45.431
What am I going to do with you, Selcan?

01:28:00.031 --> 01:28:01.264
You are my Bey.

01:28:02.697 --> 01:28:04.231
Do whatever you want.

01:28:05.431 --> 01:28:07.364
I should not have laid hand on you.

01:28:09.364 --> 01:28:13.931
I should not have put you and me
in this shame, I know. But...

01:28:14.397 --> 01:28:15.631
I die for you.

01:28:18.264 --> 01:28:22.464
It is your decision,
fit it my duty to obey.

01:28:24.631 --> 01:28:26.597
But give your decision.

01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:31.831
What you have done to me

01:28:33.031 --> 01:28:35.331
and our nomad tent is always
in my mind, Selcan.

01:28:37.897 --> 01:28:42.531
I was about to forget it
but you reminded it again.

01:28:46.464 --> 01:28:47.797
And your delusions...

01:28:49.331 --> 01:28:52.731
Your reasonless anger to Tugtekin,
my uncle and Aytolun.

01:28:53.631 --> 01:28:55.264
It is not reasonless, Bey.

01:28:57.331 --> 01:29:02.331
You have such a clean heart
that you cannot see it as I do.

01:29:03.831 --> 01:29:08.931
You mind your uncle's words
for the future of your tribe.

01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:12.497
You could not see.
-God give me patience.

01:29:15.397 --> 01:29:18.297
You cannot stand to me,
to my existence...

01:29:20.031 --> 01:29:21.597
...to the breath I take...

01:29:24.431 --> 01:29:26.264
...to the warmth of me in bed...

01:29:29.264 --> 01:29:32.464
...and everything. Right Gundogdu?

01:29:35.031 --> 01:29:37.231
Restrain the evil in you, Selcan.

01:29:38.764 --> 01:29:42.031
Restrain so you will not cause
more trouble in nomad tent.

01:29:45.031 --> 01:29:48.864
If you cause any more trouble,
you will pay the price.

01:29:52.397 --> 01:29:53.997
I will not say anything else to you.

01:30:33.764 --> 01:30:35.297
<i>I am afraid of losing my way.</i>

01:30:51.497 --> 01:30:55.297
<i>The way and the secret are</i>
 <i>hidden in legacy, Ertugrul.</i>

01:31:01.497 --> 01:31:02.497
May it be good.

01:31:06.697 --> 01:31:07.831
The legacy calls me.

01:31:38.797 --> 01:31:39.831
Listen to me.

01:31:41.797 --> 01:31:43.831
Noyan collects information

01:31:44.264 --> 01:31:45.864
about these lands until main
Mongol army arrives.

01:31:48.431 --> 01:31:50.464
He wants to browbeat us by small strikes.

01:31:51.931 --> 01:31:54.931
In this situation, we need
to alarm nomad tent.

01:31:55.997 --> 01:31:59.897
Turgut and Dogan, you will
go back to nomad tent.

01:32:00.631 --> 01:32:03.531
After you arrive, contact
with Artuk and Wild Demir.

01:32:05.397 --> 01:32:08.664
But be careful.
Tugtekin wants to entrap you.

01:32:10.831 --> 01:32:15.231
So, go in secretly or find
a good reason to go in.

01:32:16.897 --> 01:32:17.964
Understood, Bey.

01:32:18.997 --> 01:32:20.364
We will take care of it with God's help.

01:32:21.831 --> 01:32:25.497
When you arrive nomad group, you must
have your finger on the pulse.

01:32:26.631 --> 01:32:27.731
Everyone is a suspect.

01:32:29.864 --> 01:32:31.997
I suspect Tugtekin's Alp, Kocabash.

01:32:33.797 --> 01:32:38.897
If you suspect someone, keep him in sight.

01:32:40.364 --> 01:32:41.664
Do not cause trouble in nomad group.

01:32:45.831 --> 01:32:49.231
When we find the treacher in nomad group,
we could entrap Noyan.

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:51.364
What about me, Bey? What about me?

01:32:54.031 --> 01:32:55.997
You are all in it.

01:32:57.897 --> 01:32:59.731
I send you to hell, Abdurrahman.

01:33:00.831 --> 01:33:03.764
Do not ever give up.
Do not make a mistake.

01:33:04.931 --> 01:33:08.031
If you make a mistake,
we may not see you again.

01:33:09.964 --> 01:33:13.464
I give my life for this duty, Bey.
I hope, God is with me.

01:33:14.664 --> 01:33:15.731
If God permits.

01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:24.297
Try change Hamza's side.

01:33:25.597 --> 01:33:27.397
Try to win his rotten heart.

01:33:29.364 --> 01:33:31.031
You do not have to send
the news immediately.

01:33:32.264 --> 01:33:35.364
Noyan will test you.
First, gain Noyan's confidence.

01:33:38.931 --> 01:33:40.231
But what will you do, Bey?

01:33:43.731 --> 01:33:44.931
I go to take my legacy.

01:33:51.931 --> 01:33:53.431
It is time to battle, brothers.

01:33:55.231 --> 01:33:57.631
It is time to shove down enemy's throat.

01:34:00.031 --> 01:34:02.297
Come on, in it win it.

01:34:07.264 --> 01:34:08.331
Give me your blessings.

01:34:10.264 --> 01:34:11.297
You have it, Bey.

01:34:14.797 --> 01:34:15.797
You have it, Bey.

01:34:20.364 --> 01:34:21.397
You have it, Bey.

01:34:23.397 --> 01:34:26.897
If I have your blessing,
you have my blessing, too.

01:34:31.464 --> 01:34:32.464
Come on.

01:34:57.664 --> 01:34:59.231
He is furious because of
Ertugrul's escape.

01:35:00.964 --> 01:35:03.431
He might cut you in pieces
and feed the jackals.

01:35:05.264 --> 01:35:08.964
Do not worry, I know
what Baycu Noyan feels.

01:35:26.264 --> 01:35:27.297
Baycu Noyan.

01:35:33.731 --> 01:35:36.497
Baycu Noyan, I am at your service.

01:35:45.364 --> 01:35:49.864
All these lands to Byzantine
will be ours, Efrasiyab.

01:35:51.397 --> 01:35:56.264
Erzurum, Malatya, Konya, Alayi,
all of them.

01:35:58.331 --> 01:36:00.964
Do you want to take your share
from every trade in these cities?

01:36:01.597 --> 01:36:03.997
I am a merchant, of course, I do.

01:36:05.731 --> 01:36:06.931
I want every lucre of it.

01:36:11.664 --> 01:36:13.997
You will earn more than you can imagine.

01:36:16.531 --> 01:36:20.231
But we have a business, first, Efrasiyab.

01:36:22.597 --> 01:36:27.497
We will tyrannize Kayis and Dodurgas
as they have never seen.

01:36:29.297 --> 01:36:31.531
As, Ertugrul escaped

01:36:33.397 --> 01:36:35.364
and as we could not find him

01:36:37.831 --> 01:36:40.764
so he will find us.

01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:46.531
He will beg me to kill him on bended knee.

01:36:48.731 --> 01:36:50.431
I am at service, Baycu Noyan.

01:36:52.331 --> 01:36:56.964
They will dread Mongols
until Ogeday's army arrives.

01:36:59.231 --> 01:37:01.831
We will make them pauperize for a bite.

01:37:03.797 --> 01:37:05.964
First, we will give them too much gold.

01:37:08.264 --> 01:37:10.497
Then, every one of them will perish.

01:37:11.264 --> 01:37:13.364
They will have no strength
to feed to horses.

01:37:13.964 --> 01:37:18.597
Your Persian servant is skillful,
he will not let you down.

01:37:22.964 --> 01:37:24.897
So, move on.

01:37:26.497 --> 01:37:29.897
My soldiers will escort you
till their boundaries.

01:37:59.964 --> 01:38:01.430
We have not find any track yet.

01:38:05.464 --> 01:38:08.231
Set out today.
Search everywhere, Kocabash.

01:38:09.331 --> 01:38:11.430
When you see them, do not let them
escape, understood?

01:38:12.264 --> 01:38:13.264
Yes, Bey.

01:38:13.897 --> 01:38:17.031
If you capture them, show no mercy.

01:38:18.631 --> 01:38:20.631
We will not let them cause more trouble
in nomad group.

01:38:46.831 --> 01:38:49.031
We have our meals when the sun rises

01:38:50.264 --> 01:38:53.031
and sets in this marquee.

01:38:54.531 --> 01:38:57.031
Daughter in laws make these meals ready.

01:39:00.664 --> 01:39:02.964
The meals my husband does not participate
is a poison to me.

01:39:07.397 --> 01:39:09.297
Cooking meal that he does not participate
is a torture for me.

01:39:12.397 --> 01:39:13.497
Turn your face to me.

01:39:14.631 --> 01:39:15.831
I said turn your face!

01:39:18.664 --> 01:39:20.897
Halime, do not push my limits!

01:39:22.031 --> 01:39:23.731
Do you think only your husband suffered?

01:39:25.531 --> 01:39:26.831
Do you think only you are hurt?

01:39:27.831 --> 01:39:30.031
Many Hatun's husbands fell martyr.

01:39:30.997 --> 01:39:32.631
Turgut lost his Aykiz.

01:39:33.964 --> 01:39:35.997
None of them has whined as you do.

01:39:36.831 --> 01:39:40.897
My husband exiled from his nomad tent
for which he gave, life by his mother.

01:39:41.997 --> 01:39:43.431
He died the death.

01:39:44.364 --> 01:39:50.697
He was not exiled by his mother
but Hatun of Kayi, Hayme Hatun.

01:39:51.497 --> 01:39:55.331
He was not your husband,
he was Alp of Kayi, Ertugrul.

01:39:57.464 --> 01:40:00.331
If you will be a Bey's wife,
know this first.

01:40:02.331 --> 01:40:03.431
From now on

01:40:04.731 --> 01:40:08.897
if you could not hold your tongue

01:40:10.931 --> 01:40:12.464
I know how to cut it.

01:40:56.364 --> 01:40:58.364
Tell me, what is your
trouble, Selcan Hatun?

01:40:59.331 --> 01:41:02.264
I have only one trouble Aytolun
and it is you.

01:41:03.497 --> 01:41:05.797
What does your sick mind think?

01:41:06.697 --> 01:41:09.797
What does your cunning mind think?

01:41:10.831 --> 01:41:12.364
What do you want from my sister?

01:41:12.764 --> 01:41:17.531
You captured her,
what do you want, tell me?

01:41:17.964 --> 01:41:19.497
Know your place, Selcan.

01:41:20.031 --> 01:41:22.597
You are a parasite in
my husband's nomad tent.

01:41:23.297 --> 01:41:26.031
Like you are a parasite
in your husband tent.

01:41:29.364 --> 01:41:32.697
You are a snake in my uncle's bed!
A snake that must be beheaded!

01:41:35.497 --> 01:41:36.831
-Let me!
-Aytolun Hatun!

01:41:37.364 --> 01:41:38.864
Please, she does not know
what she is saying.

01:41:39.031 --> 01:41:40.331
Lay down your dagger.

01:41:40.497 --> 01:41:42.697
Let me to bring her into
the line, Gundogdu!

01:41:42.997 --> 01:41:45.531
I will bring her into the line, please!

01:41:45.897 --> 01:41:48.831
-Do you hear yourself, Gundogdu?
-Shut up!

01:41:50.497 --> 01:41:51.897
What are you saying, Gundogdu?

01:41:52.964 --> 01:41:55.031
I will not let her to capture my sister!

01:41:55.697 --> 01:41:57.764
Selcan, beat it!

01:41:58.731 --> 01:42:00.031
I will see you in the tent.

01:42:00.997 --> 01:42:01.997
Beat it!

01:42:07.031 --> 01:42:11.697
Aytolun Hatun, please keep this
between three of us.

01:42:12.597 --> 01:42:14.731
I do not want any discrimination
between two nomad tents.

01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:18.564
She is a sick woman.

01:42:19.897 --> 01:42:23.497
Forgive me for saying that
but this is the truth.

01:42:25.231 --> 01:42:29.231
Because of that, I keep this between us.

01:42:30.297 --> 01:42:32.264
But keep that woman away from me.

01:42:33.397 --> 01:42:36.297
Otherwise, I will not keep quiet.

01:42:58.831 --> 01:43:00.897
What did you give to hussy Aytolun?

01:43:02.231 --> 01:43:04.797
Tell me. Was that strength syrup?

01:43:07.297 --> 01:43:08.297
I said tell me!

01:43:09.597 --> 01:43:10.764
Strength syrup, Hanim.

01:43:18.364 --> 01:43:20.931
Does that syrup
kill a sick man like Korkut?

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:24.764
Ilkish!

01:43:25.297 --> 01:43:26.931
Of course, it kills, Selcan Hatun.

01:43:36.964 --> 01:43:37.964
Selcan!

01:43:38.831 --> 01:43:39.831
Selcan!

01:43:40.464 --> 01:43:42.231
Where are you damn woman?

01:43:51.731 --> 01:43:52.831
You were right, Selcan.

01:43:53.764 --> 01:43:55.464
I cannot stand to you.

01:43:55.964 --> 01:43:58.364
To your existence, to the breath you take.

01:43:58.764 --> 01:44:00.697
To the warmth of you in my bed, anything.

01:44:01.564 --> 01:44:02.597
Anything!

01:46:28.214 --> 01:46:31.380
So our hunt today is you.

01:46:36.447 --> 01:46:37.514
Who are you?

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:40.047
I am the Alp of Kayi Seigniory.

01:46:41.414 --> 01:46:42.980
My name is Abdurrahman Alp.

01:46:44.414 --> 01:46:45.980
What are you looking for here?

01:46:46.714 --> 01:46:48.214
Hamza Alp and Noyan.

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:50.847
I am here to talk with them.

01:46:50.914 --> 01:46:52.780
What will you talk with them?

01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:55.847
I heard that Kayi's soldiers
have allied with them.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.714
I am here to obey them.

01:46:59.747 --> 01:47:01.347
To obey?

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.114
Those who want to obey
would get themselves into trouble.

01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:16.214
Let us see about your destiny!

01:47:18.414 --> 01:47:20.047
Leave your sword.

01:47:24.014 --> 01:47:25.780
Leave your sword!

01:47:30.847 --> 01:47:32.047
Tie him!

01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:58.480
Let us take a little bit rest here.

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:22.180
I am hungry.

01:48:24.214 --> 01:48:27.047
Brother! You are always hungry.

01:48:27.114 --> 01:48:29.414
Where do you keep those you ate?

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.114
Let us prepare table.

01:48:33.347 --> 01:48:35.914
Let me find firewood.

01:48:47.514 --> 01:48:51.247
Brother. I do not get it.

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:54.280
Does one Alp draw a sword to another?

01:48:55.414 --> 01:48:57.380
How can we slaughter them?

01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:00.714
We let them into our table.

01:49:00.947 --> 01:49:02.414
We got a lot of trouble.

01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:05.914
You will see about that when we got them.

01:49:33.947 --> 01:49:36.447
We will let you go soon.
Can you find the way?

01:49:36.914 --> 01:49:38.980
We can.

01:49:46.047 --> 01:49:47.314
There are Turkmens ahead.

01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:51.947
Our swords have not tasted of blood
for a while.

01:49:52.014 --> 01:49:53.214
Let us not go back with nothing.

01:49:54.214 --> 01:49:55.514
We should take some presents.

01:49:55.914 --> 01:49:57.014
Get ready.

01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:33.447
Let us go. With God's hand.

01:52:48.114 --> 01:52:51.747
Brother! Welcome.

01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:02.147
Greetings.

01:53:05.847 --> 01:53:07.147
You were right.

01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:11.747
We have wasted our lives
for children of Suleyman Shah.

01:53:35.747 --> 01:53:41.247
So you are the Alp of Suleyman Shah,
Abdurrahman Alp.

01:53:42.314 --> 01:53:44.514
I have been looking for you
in the mountains for days.

01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:47.947
I am here to join you, Baycu Noyan.

01:54:04.847 --> 01:54:09.214
Welcome to the army
which is the strongest one...

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:11.847
...in the world, Abdurrahman.

01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:15.847
Hamza.

01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:19.380
Be a host for your brother.

01:54:19.847 --> 01:54:20.980
Thank you.

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:23.380
We found them unexpectedly.

01:57:10.747 --> 01:57:12.080
Thank you very much, brothers.

01:57:12.447 --> 01:57:14.714
We owe you a life from now on.

01:57:17.414 --> 01:57:18.814
What are you doing here?

01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:20.747
Why are you here?

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:25.480
We were looking for victims
to save from Mongol cruelty.

01:57:25.714 --> 01:57:27.280
And we found them.

01:58:00.747 --> 01:58:05.147
Tell me. How could you escape
while you were going to be executed?

01:58:05.847 --> 01:58:08.847
Thanks to the people who aware of justice
in our nomad tent.

01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:12.947
How could Ertugrul and Hayma Ana
let them execute you?

01:58:16.347 --> 01:58:18.480
I do not give my blessing to them
for what I have done for them.

01:58:20.947 --> 01:58:25.147
Ertugrul sold me out in order
not to break customs.

01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:30.347
I will revenge on them some day.

01:58:33.114 --> 01:58:34.214
Brother Abdurrahman.

01:58:35.847 --> 01:58:37.714
I will be the leader
of that nomad group someday.

01:58:40.214 --> 01:58:45.814
They will pay one by one for what they
have done to us on that day.

01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:00.847
We must find Bogac.

01:59:19.514 --> 01:59:22.847
-Are you okay, brother?
-I am okay, brother. I am okay.

01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:30.414
He has saved my life.

01:59:31.247 --> 01:59:33.180
Efrasiyab, a Persian merchant.

01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:45.247
You should come with us to nomad group.

01:59:45.447 --> 01:59:47.247
We should tell what happened here
to Tugtekin Bey.

01:59:47.314 --> 01:59:50.214
So Tugtekin Bey would understand
that you guys are not traitors.

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:57.047
We must change horseshoes, Gundogdu Bey.

02:00:57.447 --> 02:00:59.180
Do whatever it takes.

02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:02.014
Dumrul, bring it to me when it is ready.

02:01:02.147 --> 02:01:03.247
Yes, Bey.

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:04.880
May it be easy.

02:01:16.747 --> 02:01:17.780
What is it, brother?

02:01:18.414 --> 02:01:21.114
Horseshoes will be changed.
What are you doing?

02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:23.014
I have talked with community.

02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:25.047
They are worried about winter.

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:31.147
God is great. We will go to caravansary
once Persian merchant we expect got here.

02:01:34.214 --> 02:01:35.714
Are you still mad at me?

02:01:36.714 --> 02:01:37.980
Surely I am.

02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:39.780
Why?

02:01:40.514 --> 02:01:44.847
Because you are acting without thinking
just like my brother Ertugrul.

02:01:46.114 --> 02:01:50.514
Because of that you and your nomad group
will always be in trouble.

02:02:36.114 --> 02:02:37.847
So you have catched traitors?

02:02:40.747 --> 02:02:41.747
Bey...

02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:45.014
...they have saved us from Mongols.

02:02:49.947 --> 02:02:51.014
What did you say?

02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:54.780
Mongols attacked us.

02:03:00.347 --> 02:03:02.114
And they have saved us, Bey.

02:03:07.914 --> 02:03:10.947
I told you that you act without thinking.

02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:16.214
So traitors have saved your Alps
who went to capture traitors, right?

02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:32.847
And who is this man?

02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:36.414
I am Persian merchant Efrasiyab.

02:03:37.914 --> 02:03:40.747
Welcome. Welcome.

02:04:10.514 --> 02:04:13.080
Turgut Alp! Dogan Alp!

02:04:27.814 --> 02:04:28.980
Where is Ertugrul Bey?

02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:32.847
He has said hello to you, Sultan Halime.

02:04:33.014 --> 02:04:34.014
Did not he come with you?

02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:36.980
He did not.

02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:39.047
Where is he then?

02:04:43.147 --> 02:04:45.114
He also did not tell us where he went.

02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:47.714
What do you mean he did not tell?

02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:52.180
How could you come back to nomad group
leaving him like that, Turgut?

02:04:53.380 --> 02:04:54.914
Could not you say "Stop!"?

02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:58.414
Could not you say "Bey, you can't go
anywhere without us?"

02:05:02.314 --> 02:05:04.747
Did you scare to die with him?

02:05:07.914 --> 02:05:10.247
Even Aykiz is more brave than you.

02:05:13.947 --> 02:05:15.314
You were supposed to be an Alp.

02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:07.480
We have been waiting you for long time.

02:06:09.147 --> 02:06:13.080
You know, everywhere is dangerous.
We go slowly.

02:06:13.747 --> 02:06:14.947
Where is your caravan?

02:06:15.514 --> 02:06:20.080
I go first. If I don't smell fishy
then my caravan would come.

02:06:20.414 --> 02:06:21.414
Alright.

02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:23.514
This tent is at your service.

02:06:24.714 --> 02:06:26.347
Take a rest. Enjoy it.

02:06:26.814 --> 02:06:30.480
-We will meet and talk tonight.
-Thank you.

02:06:44.214 --> 02:06:48.014
You have hard work here,
Persian merchant. It is really hard.

02:06:52.947 --> 02:06:55.447
You are so clumsy and gump Alps!

02:06:55.980 --> 02:06:58.880
Those who I ordered you to kill
have saved your lives!

02:06:58.947 --> 02:07:02.080
-We have been blindsided, Bey.
-So I wish you were killed!

02:07:05.747 --> 02:07:07.914
Whole nomad group heard about it now!

02:07:10.447 --> 02:07:12.714
You have soiled your Bey's name.

02:07:13.147 --> 02:07:15.280
Bey, we could not have expected Mongols.

02:07:15.347 --> 02:07:17.314
And they are not traitors after all.

02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:19.847
We owe them our lives.

02:07:20.147 --> 02:07:21.780
You owe them your lives?

02:07:23.714 --> 02:07:27.214
Then I take your life instead of them
so you pay for it.

02:07:49.347 --> 02:07:51.114
You owe them your life?

02:07:59.414 --> 02:08:00.780
Bey!

02:08:02.747 --> 02:08:04.147
Bey!

02:08:43.014 --> 02:08:44.814
May I come in, Hayma?

02:08:48.914 --> 02:08:50.380
Yes, you may, brother.

02:09:02.214 --> 02:09:04.914
Ertugrul's Alps are back.

02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:07.214
Yes.

02:09:07.947 --> 02:09:12.114
They had saved those Alps of yours
who you sent after them.

02:09:13.014 --> 02:09:16.814
I know that
you feel resentful towards me, Hayma.

02:09:18.914 --> 02:09:19.914
And you are right.

02:09:20.514 --> 02:09:25.247
But I have to do it
for tranquility of my nomad group.

02:09:27.314 --> 02:09:31.514
I have excluded my helpless son
from there.

02:09:32.114 --> 02:09:34.214
But you could not say stop to your son.

02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:42.247
And a presumptuous woman who could not
hold her tongue is sitting...

02:09:43.247 --> 02:09:48.214
...in this nomad group which was ruled
by my mom and aunt once.

02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:51.014
And you should know about it.

02:09:53.514 --> 02:09:57.247
Aytolun is the woman
who made me return to this life.

02:09:58.047 --> 02:10:01.214
She should get the same respect as I get.

02:10:04.047 --> 02:10:07.180
Now, leave all aside.

02:10:08.914 --> 02:10:13.880
I think that we should start a family
between two nomad groups.

02:10:16.914 --> 02:10:20.180
We should start it so our fellowship
would become stronger.

02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:23.480
Family?

02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:26.714
Whose family will it be?

02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:33.780
Tugtekin and Gokce.

02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.380
Ertugrul Bey have said that
there's a traitor in nomad group.

02:10:52.714 --> 02:10:55.880
We suspected that it was Kocash
but we have saved him from Mongols.

02:10:58.014 --> 02:11:00.947
It is now our job to take that snake
from its nest.

02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:05.947
Where is Ertugrul Bey?

02:11:06.447 --> 02:11:08.447
He said that he will go to take package.

02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:10.914
Did he say that?

02:11:12.147 --> 02:11:14.047
Yes, Chief Demir.

02:11:15.014 --> 02:11:16.180
Do you know what is it?

02:12:44.214 --> 02:12:46.880
When you have asked about
where is my hometown...

02:12:47.514 --> 02:12:51.347
...I have replied you that "Everywhere
where there are our fathers' graveyards."

02:12:54.714 --> 02:12:58.714
One day, these lands
where there is your graveyard...

02:12:58.780 --> 02:13:00.447
...will be our hometown, father.

02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:08.214
It will be the hometown of our blood
and Muslim ummah where...

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:14.414
...your blessed foot stepped,
everywhere that my sword reached...

02:13:15.447 --> 02:13:17.347
...and every inch of land.

02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:23.780
I have never hesitated.

02:13:24.514 --> 02:13:25.747
I will not.

02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:28.980
As you have said to me...

02:13:29.947 --> 02:13:34.114
..."Hesitation comes the day when
valiant burried alive."

02:13:37.347 --> 02:13:42.780
I will not let them to bury neither me
nor Kayis alive.

02:13:46.747 --> 02:13:49.147
I know what to do well, father.

02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:57.380
But I am here to ask for forgiveness
for the hearts which will be broken...

02:13:58.347 --> 02:14:00.847
...and brother's blood
which will be spilled.

02:14:04.314 --> 02:14:10.447
I wanted you to know that I will not stop
fighting until I see that blessed state.

02:14:13.447 --> 02:14:15.714
I am sentenced to take a long ride, Bey.

02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:23.780
Give me your blessing, father.

02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:31.214
"Give package into his hand."

02:15:49.914 --> 02:15:54.280
Futuvvet Master is waiting for you.
Are you ready for your duty?
