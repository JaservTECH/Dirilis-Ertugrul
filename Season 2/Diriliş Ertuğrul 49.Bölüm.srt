Episode 49 will start after 12:27 min .

12:27.486 --> 12:31.486
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:50.705 --> 12:53.405
I will not let the ones who follow
Ameer Sadettin Kopek's way...

12:54.805 --> 12:57.538
...to reach into my mother's marquee.

12:58.972 --> 13:00.838
It is my duty to cut those hands.

13:02.338 --> 13:03.372
I wanted you to know.

13:16.172 --> 13:18.505
I am the representative of
Emir Saadettin here.

13:19.905 --> 13:22.272
Every word that is been told about him,
is meant for me as well.

13:23.505 --> 13:24.972
Then you are blaming me as well,
are you not?

13:30.805 --> 13:31.805
Ertugrul!

13:42.738 --> 13:43.772
What kind of training is this?

13:56.572 --> 13:59.572
Your brother's tongue is as strong
as his wrist, Gundogdu Bey.

14:19.772 --> 14:21.605
What are you getting at Gumustekin Bey?

14:22.472 --> 14:24.705
Your brother blames both
Emir Saadettin and me.

14:25.638 --> 14:28.472
Allegedly, I stole the seal from your
mother's tent with this command.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.638
How can you behave like this, brother?

14:34.905 --> 14:36.872
We have enough problems
in our marquee as it is...

14:37.238 --> 14:39.238
...now you are bothering Emir's of state?

14:42.872 --> 14:47.272
I say, somebody following
Ameer Sadettin stole the seal.

14:51.438 --> 14:52.838
A servant of his,
living in our nomad tent.

15:00.472 --> 15:05.472
Then, either my hand or your tongue
will be cut down.

15:06.805 --> 15:11.772
So that this unrest between us
will soothe, Ertugrul Bey.

15:17.805 --> 15:18.838
Gumustekin Bey?

16:06.572 --> 16:09.438
What is this sinister woman going behind?

16:33.438 --> 16:36.172
<i>Get yourself together Selcan.</i>
 <i>You did the right thing.</i>

16:36.605 --> 16:39.705
<i>Whatever happens to you, let it happen</i>
 <i>while walking on the right way.</i>

16:40.272 --> 16:41.738
<i>Instead of letting the bushes</i>
 <i>of the wrong way...</i>

16:41.938 --> 16:43.638
<i>...let the stones of the right way</i>
 <i>prick your feet.</i>

16:48.938 --> 16:49.972
Selcan Hatun.

16:53.605 --> 16:55.338
I told everything to Korkut Bey.

16:58.938 --> 17:00.272
Do not worry.

17:01.972 --> 17:03.405
He does not know about you.

17:04.172 --> 17:05.872
Even if he knows, do you think I care?

17:06.438 --> 17:08.472
I am ready to do what you will ask of me.

17:12.938 --> 17:15.172
Even as a kid, you were always so brave.

17:18.972 --> 17:20.972
We will wait what Korkut Bey will do.

17:22.405 --> 17:23.505
Now, go away.

17:24.772 --> 17:27.205
Whatever happens, do not tell
anything to anyone.

17:28.372 --> 17:32.305
It is high time, Banu Cicek.
The chain will brake at the weak point.

17:34.338 --> 17:37.572
When that happens, I do not wish anyone
other than me to be harmed by it.

17:38.905 --> 17:40.838
I will let nothing happen to you.

17:42.805 --> 17:45.872
If anything happens to me,
you will carry the flag.

17:47.505 --> 17:50.338
There is no need for all of us to get
the dirty end of the stick.

18:15.705 --> 18:18.838
Now go. It will happen as the way
it is meant to be.

19:04.738 --> 19:06.705
What do you think you are doing, Ertugrul?

19:08.505 --> 19:10.505
How could you say such a thing
to Gumustekin?

19:12.272 --> 19:15.805
How could you blame Gumustekin
for treason and theft?

19:21.738 --> 19:22.938
Gundogdu, what is happening?

19:24.172 --> 19:25.872
My brother Ertugrul sharpened his tongue.

19:26.238 --> 19:29.738
He sharpened so that he can try and
cut Gumustekin's head when the time comes!

19:31.572 --> 19:33.738
Ertugrul. Son, what is happening?

19:36.472 --> 19:38.272
I know why the seal was stolen, mother.

19:42.205 --> 19:43.505
Do you think Gumustekin did that?

19:47.772 --> 19:51.738
My brother, at the training area,
in the presence of so many Alps

19:52.172 --> 19:55.972
held his sword against Gumustekin's neck!
Mother, held his sword against his neck!

20:02.238 --> 20:03.305
The night it was stolen...

20:03.805 --> 20:08.238
...only you two knew that the Sungurtekin
has the seal.

20:09.638 --> 20:14.205
How is it possible for Gumustekin
to know that there is a seal...

20:14.605 --> 20:15.872
...so he came in and stole it
from our marquee?

20:17.272 --> 20:18.605
Ameer Sadettin also knew that, mother.

20:21.738 --> 20:23.472
Are you thinking the same thing, Sungur?

20:24.572 --> 20:26.172
Do you agree with Ertugrul?

20:26.872 --> 20:31.772
Gumustekin went his ways to stole the seal
and gave it to Ameer Sadettin Kopek...

20:32.405 --> 20:33.972
...and then he gave it to Tankut!
Is that right?

20:38.472 --> 20:39.572
Yes, it is.

20:44.672 --> 20:47.305
My God! My Maker! Spare my mind!

20:47.672 --> 20:51.238
My brother, do you have any proof,
any evidence?

20:51.672 --> 20:56.305
You do not only accuse Gumustekin
but his Holliness Sadettin Kopek as well!

20:57.572 --> 20:59.205
I do not have any evidence yet, brother.

21:02.605 --> 21:04.938
But sooner or later,
I will get that as well.

21:05.572 --> 21:07.905
You will! You will!

21:17.438 --> 21:19.972
While we are scorching
in the desert of pain...

21:20.605 --> 21:22.905
...I have found an oasis
like Goncagul for myself...

21:23.738 --> 21:25.305
...and you ruined that as well!

21:25.772 --> 21:29.272
My brother, are you aware that
the man you accuse is the father...

21:30.205 --> 21:32.472
...of the woman who is to be my wife!

21:34.672 --> 21:36.172
There are things that I know, brother.

21:36.905 --> 21:39.472
Brother, what are those things you know?

21:39.705 --> 21:41.705
Tell us! Tell us and make us aware!

21:42.238 --> 21:43.572
Tell mother! Let mother know as well!

21:49.672 --> 21:50.772
I am done talking.

21:51.472 --> 21:52.638
Done talking?

21:53.472 --> 21:54.638
Done talking!

21:55.572 --> 21:57.538
The mysterious act that you have been
playing for so long...

21:57.838 --> 22:00.205
...made me tired brother,
you should know that.

22:00.938 --> 22:02.638
Not only yours, Sungur's as well.

22:03.472 --> 22:05.172
I do not know who are those that
you consort with.

22:05.538 --> 22:08.272
However, the ones you consort with...

22:08.472 --> 22:10.405
...made you act like this,
you should know that.

22:13.605 --> 22:18.638
From now on, no truth will hide itself
in nooks and crannies, brother.

22:22.205 --> 22:23.872
-I will go to any lengths.
-Go brother.

22:24.405 --> 22:27.872
Go wherever you wish to go.
Go to the uttermost end of hell, Ertugrul.

22:28.205 --> 22:29.272
Gundogdu!

22:34.538 --> 22:35.872
I repent! May God forgive.

22:39.672 --> 22:41.872
Done talking! Look what he said!

22:43.872 --> 22:47.638
Instead of coming and talking to me
at first, talking to his mother first!

22:56.472 --> 22:57.538
Good God!

22:57.705 --> 23:01.638
He held his sword against that man's neck
in the presence of the Alps, mother!

23:02.638 --> 23:03.772
How can this be?

23:07.805 --> 23:10.772
Shame on him! What a shame!

23:13.172 --> 23:16.538
Brother, just be patient.

23:17.672 --> 23:18.772
Ertugrul may be right.

23:18.938 --> 23:21.972
My God, brother! What does it mean
he may be right?

23:22.838 --> 23:23.905
What if he is not?

23:25.405 --> 23:26.871
This is what we are fighting for!

23:29.172 --> 23:30.938
Vandalizing is not the way to do it!

23:31.505 --> 23:32.871
I have told him a thousand times!

23:47.372 --> 23:48.372
What will I do?

23:55.638 --> 23:57.238
I have just seen Selcan.

23:58.272 --> 23:59.505
She left our marquee.

24:02.538 --> 24:03.772
What does she want from you, Bey?

24:04.905 --> 24:07.405
She spilled out the beans in her mouth.

24:07.872 --> 24:10.572
Her evil reverberates on that
woman's tongue.

24:12.972 --> 24:14.438
What else would we expect from her?

24:17.172 --> 24:21.472
She told me that she knew what happened
between you and me before Duru died!

24:23.572 --> 24:26.705
That vixen wants to hinder
Goncagul's marriage!

24:27.705 --> 24:29.338
She can tell every possible lie.

24:37.705 --> 24:39.272
Did she tell you anything else, Bey?

24:46.672 --> 24:52.738
If what happened between us before,
my wife died reaches Tugtekin's ears...

24:54.272 --> 24:56.638
...how can I look at my son's face
with this shame?

25:01.538 --> 25:02.538
Father.

25:03.538 --> 25:07.172
As Ertugrul was training, he held his
sword against Gumustekin's throat.

25:08.172 --> 25:09.572
Then, Gundogdu separated them.

25:11.205 --> 25:12.738
Can you understand what is happening?

25:13.905 --> 25:15.838
We will see, Ertugrul is the one
behind this as well.

25:16.438 --> 25:21.438
Know your enemies. Take your measures
or it will be too late.

25:28.338 --> 25:29.438
What does my mother say, father?

25:31.538 --> 25:32.572
What is happening?

25:33.772 --> 25:35.638
What is it that related with Ertugrul?

25:42.305 --> 25:44.538
Ertugrul will pay the price for this!

25:45.438 --> 25:47.538
I will choke him on his own words!

25:48.672 --> 25:53.672
Whoever comes at my way in this cause,
I will not stop without smashing them!

25:56.405 --> 25:57.438
Brother!

25:59.672 --> 26:01.638
Are you alright? I heard what happened.

26:01.872 --> 26:03.372
I am not alright, Aytolun.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.838
Ertugrul knows more than I thought.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.905
He called me on the account for the seal!
Me!

26:22.338 --> 26:23.438
There is more, brother.

26:24.805 --> 26:28.838
Selcan came to talk to Korkut.

26:30.472 --> 26:32.372
Aunt, what are you saying?

26:33.705 --> 26:37.705
Your threats with the necklace will
not work anymore, Goncagul.

26:39.705 --> 26:41.672
She will spit her poison slowly.

26:43.538 --> 26:45.705
Who else did the sinister woman talk to?

26:47.538 --> 26:49.905
I followed her after she left our marquee.

26:51.672 --> 26:56.738
I saw Banu Cicek leaving her tent.

27:00.672 --> 27:04.638
Apparently, she wants to use
Banu Cicek's love for Duru Hatun.

27:05.338 --> 27:07.905
-What did she tell to Korkut Bey?
-I talked to Korkut.

27:09.805 --> 27:11.572
Selcan told him that she knows...

27:11.972 --> 27:15.605
...what happened between me and Korkut
before Duru Hatun died.

27:16.938 --> 27:19.605
How could this happen?
What if she knows more?

27:21.872 --> 27:24.205
It is impossible for her to know
how Duru died.

27:25.372 --> 27:27.205
Korkut sent Selcan away.

27:28.305 --> 27:30.705
What scares Korkut the most
is the possibility...

27:30.905 --> 27:32.538
...of someone telling Tugtekin
about the matter.

27:32.905 --> 27:34.738
This matter has gone too far.

27:35.572 --> 27:37.172
How far will it strech like this?

27:37.505 --> 27:40.538
There is no peace for any of us
until Korkut dies.

27:41.572 --> 27:43.538
Instead of waiting for the wedding,
let us finish the job.

27:45.438 --> 27:47.305
Tugtekin and Gokce must get married.

27:47.938 --> 27:49.738
We cannot let this matter drag any longer.

27:53.705 --> 27:56.205
-Did you tell him everything, Selcan?
-Everything.

27:56.605 --> 27:57.672
What he say?

27:57.872 --> 28:02.605
He dismissed me. People learning
his intimacy drove him crazy.

28:03.738 --> 28:06.338
He is scared, thinking;
what if Tugtekin hears about this?

28:07.238 --> 28:08.738
Because of this, his hands are tied.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.305
What about Duru Hatun's death?

28:13.572 --> 28:15.572
He will soothe himself for some time
thinking I made it up...

28:15.805 --> 28:17.472
...as I am jealous of Goncagul.

28:18.838 --> 28:23.572
However, I have sown the seeds of doubt
to him once. It will devour him.

28:24.972 --> 28:27.938
Let us see when he will face Aytolun
and talk to her.

28:30.338 --> 28:34.405
I did what I could do, Halime.
The rest is Korkut Bey's duty.

28:35.905 --> 28:37.838
I will come back as a Margrave from Konya.

28:39.372 --> 28:41.572
That time in marquee,
Tugtekin must be the one sitting...

28:42.938 --> 28:44.338
...not the old man.

28:50.305 --> 28:54.272
Ertugrul and Selcan.

28:56.472 --> 28:58.405
What if they act together?

28:59.572 --> 29:01.738
Even if it is not so right now,
sooner or later that will also happen.

29:02.972 --> 29:05.338
Apparently, the tongue of that woman
will not stay silent.

29:06.172 --> 29:07.805
The gauntlet has been thrown.

29:10.638 --> 29:11.972
So what are we gonna do now, father?

29:19.372 --> 29:21.572
Gundogdu's reins must be kept tightened.

29:23.772 --> 29:25.405
He is worried about you.

29:26.572 --> 29:28.238
He is afraid to lose you.

29:32.405 --> 29:36.738
I will do my best fuel Gundogdu's anger
towards Ertugrul.

29:38.605 --> 29:42.605
If I can succeed, I will send his mother
on him as well.

29:45.272 --> 29:47.605
You sound out that girl called Banu Cicek.

29:49.505 --> 29:51.772
Let us see what she keeps as a secret.

29:55.076 --> 29:57.776
Selcan, look at me. Look, sister.

29:59.110 --> 30:02.510
I have been there for you
and did what I could.

30:03.410 --> 30:07.576
But I have to tell Ertugrul Bey
what happened.

30:09.876 --> 30:12.743
I never kept anything from him, Selcan.
Please understand.

30:13.543 --> 30:16.610
Halime, if you tell him now

30:17.410 --> 30:21.043
Aytolun and Goncagul will come up
like a wood in water.

30:22.676 --> 30:27.476
You know that I do not have anything
but my necklace to prove what I said.

30:28.943 --> 30:30.576
I am begging you to wait a little longer.

30:31.976 --> 30:33.843
Wait until Gokce's wedding.

30:34.943 --> 30:37.810
I know if Korkut Bey has a little
bit of conscience

30:38.310 --> 30:40.776
he will go after and take care
of this matter himself.

30:42.076 --> 30:45.376
However, if Ertugrul Bey hears about it

30:46.543 --> 30:49.010
no one can know who this filthy swamp
will devour.

31:25.076 --> 31:31.110
Your services to the Bey are
worthy of esteem, Banu Cicek.

31:33.476 --> 31:36.076
They befit to a Dodurga Hatun.

31:38.943 --> 31:42.776
However, I think a girl as skillful as you

31:44.376 --> 31:47.010
will provide more valuable services.

31:48.876 --> 31:52.643
Comparing to what Korkut Bey
and Duru Hatun did for me

31:53.576 --> 31:55.376
these are nothing, Aytolun Hatun.

31:58.610 --> 32:00.876
You loved the deceased, did you not?

32:05.010 --> 32:06.376
Of course, I did.

32:07.343 --> 32:08.976
I did love her deeply.

32:11.310 --> 32:16.010
However, she died without any sickness.

32:18.076 --> 32:20.110
It still hurts my heart.

32:35.443 --> 32:38.676
You can never know when will
death come for you, Banu Cicek.

32:40.476 --> 32:41.810
Yesterday, Duru Hatun.

32:43.510 --> 32:45.743
Tomorrow, us.

32:47.943 --> 32:53.476
Like death, you can never know
whose hands will it come from!

32:57.043 --> 32:59.743
May God protect us from
those sinister hands.

33:38.443 --> 33:39.710
I will take my leave then, Hanim.

33:57.610 --> 33:59.810
Your death will come from my hands.

34:10.110 --> 34:12.043
This matter will go as
far as it can, Ertugrul.

34:13.676 --> 34:16.943
If it will not, it will be a burden
to you, to my mother and our marquee.

34:19.376 --> 34:20.643
However, this is not the issue.

34:22.010 --> 34:23.476
The issue is Gundogdu Bey.

34:27.876 --> 34:31.610
The man whose throat you shoved down,
will be Gundogdu Bey's father in law soon.

34:33.343 --> 34:35.076
Goncagul and his wedding is soon.

34:35.410 --> 34:36.810
When we bear this doubt inside

34:37.443 --> 34:39.043
will we take her daughter
in our marquee Halime?

34:41.610 --> 34:43.610
Goncagul can be innocent as she is.

34:44.843 --> 34:48.776
As long as this doubt exists, the home
they will build will not be worthy.

34:50.410 --> 34:51.576
Do not forget that this doubt
only belongs to the people

34:51.776 --> 34:53.076
who believe in you, Ertugrul Bey.

34:54.043 --> 34:56.110
My mother's marquee is not
a regular tent, Halime.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.310
Those people who get inside of my mother's
marquee in secret yesterday

34:59.743 --> 35:01.610
can do anything without us noticing it,
when they have the chance.

35:04.810 --> 35:07.510
What about Goncagul and Gundogdu Bey's
wedding, Ertugrul Bey?

35:12.910 --> 35:14.043
This is not a heart matter.

35:15.343 --> 35:16.843
It is about Kayi's future.

35:20.410 --> 35:24.110
It is my duty to stop this wedding,
if necessary.

35:37.443 --> 35:38.610
That direful man.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.843
<i>Permisson, Gumustekin Bey?</i>

35:47.676 --> 35:48.810
Come in, Gundogdu Bey.

36:11.610 --> 36:13.810
Thinking about what happened
brings me sadness, Bey.

36:20.410 --> 36:22.676
He disobeyed the law and put me to shame.
He disgraced me by ignoring the rules

36:22.910 --> 36:24.710
of the training in the presence
of the Alps.

36:26.109 --> 36:28.710
Yet it did not satisfy him, he went ahead
and held his sword agains my throat

36:28.910 --> 36:30.443
in the presence of everyone.

36:31.343 --> 36:32.443
He still did not get satistied

36:32.610 --> 36:35.110
then he cast aspersions on me
and disregarded my honor.

36:36.443 --> 36:38.443
Not just you, even the whole
world feels sadness

36:38.676 --> 36:40.343
does it make any difference, Gundogdu Bey?

36:44.676 --> 36:48.976
Your mother interrogated my daughter
recently, for that ominous deposit.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.076
And today, your brother.

36:53.376 --> 36:55.043
Being so clever, he came at me
to test the water.

36:56.643 --> 37:00.910
He thought he could wangle words
out of me by teasing me.

37:03.776 --> 37:04.976
What a shame.

37:06.810 --> 37:10.543
Please do not, Bey.
There must be a way to correct this.

37:11.810 --> 37:14.343
To correct what, Gundogdu Bey?
Correct what?

37:17.476 --> 37:20.310
From now on, there will be no wedding
for you with my daughter.

37:24.310 --> 37:29.843
Do not come into my tent again, unless you
solve this matter between yourselves.

38:20.043 --> 38:21.110
It is nothing, Dogan Alp.

38:22.743 --> 38:23.776
I cut my hand.

38:24.743 --> 38:26.076
It may be a deep wound,
you need to dress it.

38:36.710 --> 38:37.710
Wait.

38:39.676 --> 38:40.710
I will help.

38:55.076 --> 38:59.410
You must press on it like this,
so that it will not bleed more.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.043
Thank you.

39:17.076 --> 39:19.610
It would not hurt this much
if it was my own hand.

39:22.510 --> 39:23.976
A person bleeds to his lover, Dogan Alp.

39:30.343 --> 39:33.343
Duru Hatun could not see Tugtekin Bey
come together with his lover.

39:37.643 --> 39:39.010
I wish these would not happen.

39:45.776 --> 39:46.776
If you will excuse me.

40:15.976 --> 40:17.476
Who is the human, Efendi?

40:19.843 --> 40:21.810
Human is the seal of God on earth.

40:24.076 --> 40:27.910
Trees, birds, plants, oceans, rivers.

40:28.610 --> 40:29.676
Why are they here?

40:32.076 --> 40:33.976
Why does the moon beautify the night?

40:34.976 --> 40:36.910
Why does the sun warm up the world?

40:37.776 --> 40:39.876
Why does the ocean swing like a cradle?

40:40.910 --> 40:44.010
Why the river flows?
Why does the sun rise?

40:45.110 --> 40:46.776
Why does the risen sun set?

40:48.910 --> 40:50.410
All for the human.

40:52.610 --> 40:55.510
All the beauty in the universe,
all this show

40:56.043 --> 40:58.943
all this preperation are
only for the humans.

41:00.376 --> 41:01.743
For human to come alive.

41:02.776 --> 41:04.510
For the human to have peace.

41:05.410 --> 41:07.010
For the human to be grateful.

41:09.110 --> 41:11.910
But the human is ungrateful.

41:13.576 --> 41:14.976
He looks but he can not see.

41:16.043 --> 41:17.743
He hears but he can not feel.

41:25.043 --> 41:27.843
If this one breath was not here,
human would fall.

41:30.410 --> 41:32.043
He falls but can not see the truth.

41:33.010 --> 41:34.543
He will not remember God.

41:35.343 --> 41:36.876
He thinks he owns the power.

41:39.443 --> 41:42.010
May God make us of the grateful ones.

41:43.110 --> 41:44.110
Amen.

41:52.476 --> 41:54.043
-Peace be with you.
-And with you.

41:54.776 --> 41:56.676
Beautiful person, brave person.

42:11.343 --> 42:13.643
Tell me about the places you have been.

42:27.910 --> 42:28.943
Gundogdu.

42:30.643 --> 42:31.710
This is the end, mother.

42:32.710 --> 42:33.810
What is happening my son?

42:34.776 --> 42:38.576
My brother Ertugrul has returned from
his voyage with one more victory.

42:40.810 --> 42:41.810
What voyage?

42:43.043 --> 42:45.043
The voyage of overpowering Gumustekin Bey.

42:47.843 --> 42:50.343
Did you speak with Gumustekin?

42:52.476 --> 42:57.876
And his victory was to stain his brother's
honor and to break his wedding.

43:06.710 --> 43:09.710
Gundogdu, every cloud has a silver lining.

43:11.910 --> 43:13.410
You must be patient.

43:26.576 --> 43:30.010
Selcan has made Banu Cicek's
head swim, brother.

43:32.343 --> 43:35.476
You must see how she looks at me
with hatred.

43:36.376 --> 43:38.576
How are we going to get through this?

43:39.543 --> 43:41.110
Everyone will hear about it.

43:50.310 --> 43:53.576
Korkut must die in the presence
of his Alps.

43:54.010 --> 43:56.710
His killer must be executed right there.

43:57.310 --> 43:58.410
His killer?

43:59.543 --> 44:00.643
Banu Cicek.

44:02.476 --> 44:07.743
If that poor girl who was confused
by Selcan's accusations

44:08.643 --> 44:09.976
and slander to kill Korkut

44:12.076 --> 44:14.410
we will kill three birds with one stone.

44:16.510 --> 44:20.643
But, how are we going to convince people
to this sham?

44:26.943 --> 44:28.710
Begin the preparation of
a poison right away.

44:30.710 --> 44:31.743
As you wish.

44:33.376 --> 44:36.110
I will ask for one more sacrifice, sister.

44:37.043 --> 44:41.610
I set my mind on this blessed road
with you until death, brother.

44:43.776 --> 44:45.376
Tell me what is it that you wish me to do.

44:49.510 --> 44:51.010
You will drink that poison as well.

44:54.976 --> 44:56.776
Do not worry, do not worry.

44:57.943 --> 45:01.110
Artuk will save you from
the cold hands of death.

45:03.643 --> 45:07.043
Just like he did to Korkut many times.

45:09.476 --> 45:16.043
It will be seen as Banu Cicek has
both Korkut and you as her targets.

45:20.743 --> 45:24.776
As you see Efendi, Byzantine has
became unfamiliar to his own public.

45:27.543 --> 45:30.110
You have met with new people
and new places.

45:30.610 --> 45:32.710
You have appealed to them with your heart.

45:33.810 --> 45:35.910
You reminded them of their humanity.

45:37.610 --> 45:39.810
And they reminded me that there are
a lot of opressed people

45:40.043 --> 45:42.810
who need justice on the earth's surface.
-You are right.

45:43.776 --> 45:48.110
Once upon a time, polytheists from Mecca
also forgot about their humanity

45:49.410 --> 45:51.810
and buried their daughters alive.

45:52.910 --> 45:55.743
Our prophet, with the God's grace

45:56.743 --> 45:59.876
told them about the secrets of being human

46:01.043 --> 46:02.643
so the world became peaceful.

46:04.976 --> 46:06.076
What was that secret?

46:08.376 --> 46:11.876
"God is one and only and Muhammed
is his messenger."

46:13.010 --> 46:16.110
You can not reach the secret of being
human without knowing God first.

46:17.976 --> 46:19.810
What about the people who say
they are Muslim but still cruel?

46:20.710 --> 46:22.376
What about the ones
who fight over religion?

46:23.476 --> 46:26.543
What about the ones who cooperate
with infidels and stab us in the back?

46:28.343 --> 46:31.110
They are indeed the real cruels.

46:33.010 --> 46:39.810
In our prophets last speech, he said,
"Arab is not better than Persian."

46:40.510 --> 46:42.910
But they kill over religion.

46:43.910 --> 46:45.676
They kill the Muslim.

46:46.743 --> 46:49.743
How can a Muslim accuse another Muslim
of infidelity?

46:51.110 --> 46:53.343
How can a Muslim kill a Muslim?

46:54.843 --> 46:57.376
My God said in Fetih surah:

46:58.876 --> 47:00.843
"Muhammad is the messenger of God.

47:01.343 --> 47:02.743
Whoever is beside him

47:03.510 --> 47:08.510
are strong against infidels
and are merciful among believers."

47:10.376 --> 47:15.776
Son, if we want to serve the humanity,
we have to correct our home,

47:16.376 --> 47:20.910
our nomad tent, our tribe, our city first.

47:22.376 --> 47:25.610
You can not build anything on rotten soil.

47:26.876 --> 47:31.076
We can not serve humanity
without cleaning our homes.

47:34.110 --> 47:38.376
The hardest and toughest trial is coming
from our brothers, are they not?

47:41.776 --> 47:48.543
Do not forget. The most cruel to our
prophet was his uncle, Ebu Leheb.

47:50.843 --> 47:55.110
However, his pillar of support
was his cousin Ali.

47:57.010 --> 47:59.910
May God give his followers
a fellow like Ali.

48:00.110 --> 48:01.343
-Amen.
-Amen.

48:03.010 --> 48:05.110
You son of Suleyman Shah, Ertugrul.

48:05.976 --> 48:08.843
It is understood that you have
a new road coming up.

48:10.410 --> 48:15.043
You must go to this road with the
most sincere and purest people.

48:16.043 --> 48:19.010
So that you serve the best where you go.

48:19.843 --> 48:22.510
Do not forget. Your site is your mirror.

48:23.476 --> 48:24.876
When you look at them, see yourself

48:25.843 --> 48:27.843
and when you look at yourself,
you see them.

48:49.310 --> 48:50.776
This love is unbelievable.

48:51.810 --> 48:53.610
He was like he got kicked by
a horse yesterday.

48:53.843 --> 48:56.943
Now he is happy like a donkey
who found some hay.

48:59.443 --> 49:00.510
It is love, brother.

49:01.910 --> 49:04.710
It can make you a vizier or vile.

49:10.310 --> 49:11.476
You are in love!

49:12.376 --> 49:13.543
What did you say?

49:14.343 --> 49:15.410
What did you say?

49:16.643 --> 49:22.943
My brother. How did Bey get angry to shake
Gumustekin Bey like a pile of wool?

49:23.876 --> 49:26.510
Whatever Ertugrul Bey did,
he did it on purpose.

49:28.043 --> 49:29.876
Gumustekin Bey must have done something.

49:31.743 --> 49:35.976
And Gundogdu Bey is in a hard situation.

49:37.710 --> 49:39.010
On one side his brother

49:39.943 --> 49:42.510
on the other side, his father-in-law.

49:46.543 --> 49:48.943
What is going to happen
in the end, brother?

49:50.710 --> 49:52.643
Whatever Ertugrul Bey wants

49:54.076 --> 49:55.843
he will not stop until he gets it.

49:57.810 --> 49:59.343
From now on, winds will bluster.

50:01.876 --> 50:04.910
Gundogdu Bey will either give up
on his wife

50:07.376 --> 50:08.443
or his brother.

50:22.910 --> 50:24.710
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

50:25.810 --> 50:26.943
May happiness be with you.

50:27.343 --> 50:28.676
-Thank you, Bey.
-Thank you, Bey.

50:29.376 --> 50:30.710
You brave child!

50:32.976 --> 50:35.310
You will be an Alp just like
Wild Demir expected.

50:37.476 --> 50:39.843
I see that you can even beat Dogan Alp.

50:41.576 --> 50:44.443
All I want is to be an Alp
like you, Ertugrul Bey.

50:49.010 --> 50:50.076
Grab us some ayran.

50:51.376 --> 50:52.943
I have matters to discuss
with your big brothers.

51:07.876 --> 51:08.876
Mother!

51:10.910 --> 51:15.310
You suffered from each one of us
and you still do.

51:19.310 --> 51:20.443
Even a stone would crack.

51:23.076 --> 51:24.976
It comes after one another.

51:26.010 --> 51:28.976
Son, it is not easy to be a mother.

51:29.910 --> 51:35.010
A mother gives up on her own problems,
own pain.

51:36.610 --> 51:40.943
But Ertugrul and Gundogdu
have problems between them.

51:42.510 --> 51:43.676
It tears my heart out.

51:47.443 --> 51:49.376
They share the same blood, they can
not be apart from one another, mother.

51:50.643 --> 51:53.743
It is our duty to bring them back
together when the time comes.

51:56.376 --> 51:59.910
However, if we can not take care of
Gumustekin matter, it will be difficult.

52:02.010 --> 52:06.010
Are you sure about Gumustekin,
taking part in this matter?

52:10.510 --> 52:11.510
Yes, mother.

52:14.410 --> 52:17.343
Everyone knows about what happened
to Gumustekin on the training field, Bey.

52:18.043 --> 52:19.810
Yes, Bey. God bless your hands.

52:21.843 --> 52:23.710
The die has already been cast, Alps.

52:24.710 --> 52:26.410
Gundogdu brother also supports him.

52:26.976 --> 52:32.376
From now on, we are done with
Dodurgas and these soils.

52:33.076 --> 52:34.943
We are going to Byzantine borders again.

52:36.976 --> 52:38.910
However, we will not be alone this time.

52:40.510 --> 52:46.710
We will go with whoever loves us,
believes in us, supports us.

52:47.743 --> 52:51.443
They will force you. From today,
you must be strong.

52:53.443 --> 52:55.310
You will be on good terms with people.

52:57.043 --> 53:00.376
We will slowly try to convince them
for this blessed migration.

53:00.976 --> 53:02.710
-Thank you, Bey.
-Thank you, Bey.

53:05.343 --> 53:06.343
Abdurrahman.

53:08.010 --> 53:09.376
I demand one thing from you as well.

53:10.610 --> 53:11.876
We know the situation about the tents.

53:13.810 --> 53:14.843
Things are chaotic.

53:16.543 --> 53:18.076
I do not wish something to happen
to my mother.

53:18.943 --> 53:23.543
Just like my father. You are responsible
for my mother's safety.

53:25.376 --> 53:27.610
I lay down my life for Mother Hayme, Bey.

53:30.743 --> 53:31.876
<i>Do I have your permission, mother?</i>

53:32.443 --> 53:33.510
Come, my son, come.

53:39.610 --> 53:41.576
Korkut Bey invites us to
their marquee, mother.

53:43.976 --> 53:45.443
Gumustekin is with him.

53:56.643 --> 53:57.643
Mother.

53:58.743 --> 54:00.310
Are they our enemies?

54:01.976 --> 54:02.976
Look.

54:03.876 --> 54:08.610
Gumustekin Bey has swallowed his pride
and Korkut Bey invited us.

54:09.010 --> 54:10.010
We must go.

54:11.876 --> 54:16.710
Surely, we can solve this matter
with conversation.

54:19.510 --> 54:22.543
This matter can only be solved
with one way, son.

54:26.476 --> 54:28.076
Whoever stole the seal must come out.

54:28.610 --> 54:33.510
Or neither me, nor anyone else,
no one can stop Ertugrul.

54:45.043 --> 54:46.376
Let us go then.

54:48.843 --> 54:51.043
If my brother called us,
we can not make him wait.

55:02.543 --> 55:06.410
Everyone knows about the rules and
I am not the one who writes them.

55:06.843 --> 55:10.343
I am a witness to all that happened.

55:10.910 --> 55:13.610
Is it appropriate to do it
in the presence of everyone?

55:14.043 --> 55:17.376
I ask you. His tongue is
as sharp as his sword.

55:18.810 --> 55:20.743
Nobody can say anything to his bravery.

55:21.676 --> 55:26.543
However, impertinence and measurelessness

55:26.743 --> 55:28.876
of Ertugrul has only one reason.

55:29.610 --> 55:33.010
The ominous passion of his
that he can not quench.

55:35.110 --> 55:37.010
Of course, he has achieved
important progresses.

55:37.676 --> 55:41.776
His reputation increased day by day
in Turkmen tribes and in the palace.

55:42.876 --> 55:47.643
However, his ambition that he can not
restrain is getting bigger and bigger.

55:49.376 --> 55:52.043
He no longer wants anyone
to be ahead of him.

55:52.443 --> 55:53.910
Not his brother, not his mother.

55:54.710 --> 55:57.476
There. We can see what
he did to Tugtekin Bey.

55:58.810 --> 56:01.043
After all, this is the matter.

56:02.376 --> 56:05.776
Unless someone teaches Ertugrul his lesson

56:06.743 --> 56:09.543
he will continue bringing trouble to us!

56:14.376 --> 56:16.310
Bey. Mother Hayme and her sons are here.

56:17.043 --> 56:18.043
Bring them in.

56:38.776 --> 56:39.776
Be seated.

56:59.876 --> 57:02.443
You bring me joy by coming
here, Hayme Hatun.

57:05.743 --> 57:12.410
We all know about the unpleasant incident
between Gumustekin Bey and Ertugrul Bey.

57:14.610 --> 57:20.443
I think that it is not applicable for
these two youngsters to keep suffering

57:21.843 --> 57:27.343
because of the words that were
told tactlessly, even though

57:28.443 --> 57:34.010
it is known that they love and
set their hearts on each other.

57:35.110 --> 57:38.110
That is why, I say this to Gumustekin Bey.

57:39.543 --> 57:43.443
Keep Gundogdu Bey and Ertugrul Bey
apart from each other.

57:45.676 --> 57:49.610
Do not upset your daughter
and Gundogdu Bey

57:50.710 --> 57:52.443
who you love like a son any longer.

57:56.610 --> 58:01.776
I am also happy for Hayme Hatun
to come here with her grace.

58:04.010 --> 58:07.376
It is the outcome of the respect
that she feels for us, apparently.

58:09.776 --> 58:11.543
As for my child, Gundogdu.

58:12.810 --> 58:16.643
He will always be a brave son for me.

58:17.710 --> 58:20.710
I saw the essence of his heart

58:21.343 --> 58:24.076
when we went to raid that
Mongolian dog Noyan's house.

58:25.776 --> 58:29.510
Every father of a girl would like
to see him as a son in law.

58:30.943 --> 58:34.076
And I told him this, at every turn.

58:34.910 --> 58:35.943
Thank you, Bey.

58:36.676 --> 58:39.643
We know how much you love and respect
my mother and me.

58:40.543 --> 58:41.876
We feel honored for this.

58:45.710 --> 58:52.676
However, this marriage is a matter
between two Bey families.

58:54.043 --> 58:57.710
Unless Ertugrul Bey comes to apologise
to me in person

58:59.343 --> 59:00.943
it is improper to give my daughter to him.

59:10.710 --> 59:12.643
Maybe it is inappropriate for me
to speak in front of elders.

59:14.076 --> 59:15.710
But I would like to say something.

59:17.443 --> 59:19.610
Tomorrow is the blessed day that
we were waiting so long for with Gokce.

59:22.810 --> 59:25.576
We would not want that day
to be a sad one.

59:27.576 --> 59:28.843
Tomorrow is our wedding day.

59:30.876 --> 59:34.710
Maybe there is something else
to do, Gumustekin Bey.

59:36.310 --> 59:38.576
Our son Tugtekin is right, brother.

59:40.576 --> 59:43.610
Maybe you will think once more tonight.

59:49.010 --> 59:50.610
We have a wedding tomorrow.

59:52.443 --> 59:55.510
We should not be estranged from
each other on a day like this.

00:59:56.943 --> 01:00:00.043
I left my daughter Goncagul
at home, in tears.

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:02.710
Do you think this is easy
for me, Korkut Bey?

01:00:04.676 --> 01:00:07.610
Ertugrul Bey's words are
impossible to swallow.

01:00:12.343 --> 01:00:13.810
Are they not, Sungurtekin Bey?

01:00:18.776 --> 01:00:21.576
It is not seen that my brother Ertugrul
has ever made a mistake.

01:00:26.076 --> 01:00:28.410
However, I hope that
he was wrong this time.

01:00:29.676 --> 01:00:32.910
So you think like your brother,
Sungurtekin Bey?

01:00:34.076 --> 01:00:36.376
What I think is not important,
Gumustekin Bey.

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:38.710
As you know

01:00:39.476 --> 01:00:42.776
when Ertugrul wants something
nobody can stop him until he is done.

01:00:44.676 --> 01:00:48.910
Hopefully, this matter will be solved soon
so you may be in peace.

01:00:55.343 --> 01:00:56.910
I will perform your wedding
ceremony tomorrow.

01:00:58.643 --> 01:01:02.410
And you shall think and decide.

01:01:06.376 --> 01:01:12.976
We will see in time if what Ertugrul said
was true or not.

01:01:15.343 --> 01:01:17.010
Gumustekin Bey is right.

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:27.676
This wedding is between Bey families
of two nomad groups.

01:01:32.376 --> 01:01:35.610
If one of those families are not at ease

01:01:37.376 --> 01:01:40.110
this marriage will be a reason
for unpleasantless.

01:01:43.076 --> 01:01:46.576
We all know about the love
between youngsters.

01:01:49.743 --> 01:01:50.976
When the situation is like this

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:57.076
I also am not complying

01:01:58.576 --> 01:02:01.710
with this marriage
until the truth comes out.

01:02:21.576 --> 01:02:23.343
<i>If Ertugrul Bey hears about it</i>

01:02:24.343 --> 01:02:26.843
<i>no one can know who this filthy swamp</i>
 <i>will devour.</i>

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:32.810
Welcome, Bey.

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:38.843
Where is my mother, Halime?

01:02:39.943 --> 01:02:43.510
Korkut Bey called her to the marquee.
She went there with your brothers.

01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:48.643
Korkut Bey wants to secure the peace.

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.743
Gumustekin is playing
a new trick for sure.

01:02:54.043 --> 01:02:55.610
We will see what comes out of it.

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:01.043
<i>How can you do this, mother?</i>

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:05.543
<i>How can you say something like that when</i>
 <i>Gumustekin is swallowing his honour?</i>

01:03:06.376 --> 01:03:07.810
This is better, Gundogdu.

01:03:08.543 --> 01:03:11.910
This wedding will not bring joy to us
unless whoever stole the seal comes out.

01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:14.510
Thank you, mother. Thank you.

01:03:17.843 --> 01:03:19.776
Are you happy my brother?
Your wish has come true.

01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:22.310
You saved our nomad tent from trouble.

01:03:24.476 --> 01:03:25.776
Obviously, mother also agrees.

01:03:27.076 --> 01:03:29.076
I hope you are right about
this decision you made.

01:03:30.343 --> 01:03:31.510
-Brother.
-Ertugrul.

01:03:38.776 --> 01:03:41.443
Until now, I never listened to you my son

01:03:42.976 --> 01:03:44.476
and you were always right.

01:03:45.376 --> 01:03:46.776
I will listen to you in this matter.

01:03:48.843 --> 01:03:50.376
Until the person who stole
the seal comes out

01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:54.043
I will not let Gundogdu and Goncagul
get married.

01:03:56.376 --> 01:03:59.510
However, if you are wrong

01:04:00.743 --> 01:04:03.710
I do not know how can we face them.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.910
Gokce has her wedding tomorrow.

01:04:11.476 --> 01:04:13.843
I do not want any more trouble.
Do you understand me?

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:17.810
I understand, mother.

01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:20.310
Good.

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:41.910
Gundogdu Bey.

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:58.810
My father and Mother Hayme believes
in Ertugrul Bey's claim, Gundogdu Bey.

01:05:00.643 --> 01:05:02.610
This may be our last conversation.

01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:04.010
Goncagul.

01:05:04.443 --> 01:05:07.410
I am begging you. I am begging you,
listen to me, Gundogdu Bey.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:17.543
I ran down my honour and entered your tent
in secret like a vile woman.

01:05:18.343 --> 01:05:20.410
Let me say what I want to say, at least.

01:05:21.843 --> 01:05:25.843
As you know, truth will come out
sooner or later, Gundogdu Bey.

01:05:26.776 --> 01:05:29.476
Ertugrul Bey will understand what
a big mistake this was to make.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:34.076
Until that time arrives,
I will wait for you

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:37.576
even if it lasts a thousand years.
I want you to know that.

01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:41.676
Until my body is mixed with the earth

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:45.310
you are the owner of my heart,
Gundogdu Bey.

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:48.543
You know this.

01:05:53.443 --> 01:05:58.610
Goncagul, like you said,
truth will come out sooner or later.

01:06:00.943 --> 01:06:05.543
You should know that, no one
can take you away from me.

01:06:48.476 --> 01:06:49.976
-May it be easy, sister.
-Thank you.

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:55.843
Selcan Hatun!

01:07:00.543 --> 01:07:04.810
I will not let you hurt my wife
and my son with your slander!

01:07:06.976 --> 01:07:09.776
Obviously, you started to believe
what I said.

01:07:10.643 --> 01:07:13.643
You believe me but you
cannot say, Korkut Bey.

01:07:16.043 --> 01:07:18.576
You are afraid that your son Tugtekin

01:07:18.776 --> 01:07:20.810
who is on a wedding eve
will hear about it, I know.

01:07:21.776 --> 01:07:22.876
Be at ease.

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:28.110
I will not speak until the wedding,
for my sister's happiness.

01:07:29.976 --> 01:07:34.076
If I hear that you speak your slander
with that poisonous tongue of yours

01:07:35.043 --> 01:07:38.510
your death will come by my own
hands, Selcan. Do you understand me?

01:07:38.943 --> 01:07:40.110
Stop right there.

01:07:41.576 --> 01:07:44.976
God will make you pay for your
illicit relationship.

01:07:47.643 --> 01:07:51.610
I know. You are not involved
in Duru Aunt's death.

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:53.310
I believe that.

01:07:54.443 --> 01:07:55.810
But, you should believe this.

01:07:56.610 --> 01:08:00.376
Both my hands will be upon Aytolun
in two worlds.

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:04.110
Sooner or later,
I will reveal every truth.

01:08:29.343 --> 01:08:30.443
We are almost there Aytolun.

01:08:32.010 --> 01:08:33.110
We are almost there.

01:08:45.010 --> 01:08:46.010
Sister.

01:08:48.543 --> 01:08:49.676
If you allow me

01:08:52.576 --> 01:08:54.610
I would like to kiss your hand
and recieve your blessing.

01:09:16.543 --> 01:09:17.543
My Gokce!

01:09:20.976 --> 01:09:22.110
My dear sister!

01:09:31.676 --> 01:09:34.310
My sister! I broke your heart.

01:09:36.376 --> 01:09:38.643
Even when you were right,
I crossed the line.

01:09:41.943 --> 01:09:45.476
You have always supported me. Forgive me.

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:50.943
I want to enter my man's tent
with your blessing

01:09:52.743 --> 01:09:54.676
in my happy day.

01:09:57.343 --> 01:09:58.576
Dear sister.

01:10:02.876 --> 01:10:03.910
Thank God.

01:10:05.576 --> 01:10:08.943
My prayers will always be with you
and your man.

01:10:10.576 --> 01:10:12.676
You are a part of my life.

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:17.376
Just like you will always be with your man

01:10:19.643 --> 01:10:22.810
your sister will always be with you.

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.043
Know this Gokce.

01:10:27.043 --> 01:10:30.010
I will not let anyone break your heart.

01:10:31.676 --> 01:10:32.810
No one.

01:10:35.043 --> 01:10:36.043
Sister!

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.220
Goncagul, you should wait outside.

01:11:11.953 --> 01:11:13.886
Do not let anybody in.
-Okay, aunt.

01:11:14.486 --> 01:11:15.520
Do not worry.

01:13:37.386 --> 01:13:38.386
<i>Duru!</i>

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.020
<i>God, forgive my sins.</i>

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.086
<i>If what Selcan told is true,</i>
 <i>how could I look at my son's face?</i>

01:13:49.853 --> 01:13:52.620
<i>Take my life but do not make me</i>
 <i>live this shame.</i>

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.886
<i>You are as helpless as this</i>
 <i>scorpion, Korkut.</i>

01:14:08.953 --> 01:14:11.420
<i>You are circling</i>
 <i>in the middle of the fire.</i>

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:19.886
<i>But what you do not know is that the</i>
 <i>fire of my anger will burn your body</i>

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:25.053
<i>take your breath away,</i>
 <i>shred your heart to pieces.</i>

01:14:41.186 --> 01:14:42.186
Amen.

01:14:54.286 --> 01:14:56.486
Now, it is time to bring your bride
to my marquee, mother.

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.186
I wish she will be a woman
of a Bey worthy of you.

01:15:02.086 --> 01:15:07.153
She will always look after her man,
her nomad tent just as you.

01:15:20.086 --> 01:15:22.320
I wish your mother would be with you
on your happy day.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.820
She is always with us, father.

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:27.620
Always.

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:34.086
You will be vouchsafed to hold your
granddaughter, if God permits.

01:15:36.453 --> 01:15:37.520
I hope so, son.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.986
I hope we will be able to see those days.

01:15:43.353 --> 01:15:44.386
If God permits.

01:17:13.286 --> 01:17:14.886
With the name of God.

01:17:18.853 --> 01:17:20.119
I wish you good hennas.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.053
I wish you happy hennas.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.820
<i>I applied henna, for what?</i>

01:17:30.253 --> 01:17:34.153
<i>To sacrifice myself to the tent</i>
 <i>of the man I am married to.</i>

01:17:34.553 --> 01:17:35.586
<i>For what else?</i>

01:17:36.053 --> 01:17:39.020
<i>To know how to apply it to my Alp</i>

01:17:39.253 --> 01:17:43.220
<i>when he is going to the battlefield</i>
 <i>and to the back of my sacrificial.</i>

01:17:43.553 --> 01:17:45.386
<i>What? What else for?</i>

01:17:46.186 --> 01:17:49.286
<i>To not stop the sound of prayer calls</i>
 <i>from our ears</i>

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.953
<i>to keep permanent of our ancestral morals.</i>

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:56.253
<i>May your happiness be</i>
 <i>everlasting, Gokce Hatun.</i>

01:17:56.586 --> 01:17:59.253
<i>May your happiness be</i>
 <i>everlasting, Gokce Hatun.</i>

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.320
<i>May your happiness be</i>
 <i>everlasting, Gokce Hatun.</i>

01:18:07.486 --> 01:18:09.186
May your happiness be
everlasting, my daughter.

01:18:12.486 --> 01:18:13.620
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

01:18:23.586 --> 01:18:24.620
My sister.

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:19.620
-Finished, Bey.
-Thank you.

01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.153
This is a holy day, son of my uncle.

01:20:01.553 --> 01:20:03.120
Love is always holly, Ertugrul Bey.

01:20:07.286 --> 01:20:08.286
Thank you.

01:20:10.353 --> 01:20:13.920
Your happiness became our happiness
in this downturn.

01:20:15.186 --> 01:20:16.186
Thank you.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.953
Ertugrul Bey, you should know that
Gumustekin is my half father.

01:20:22.153 --> 01:20:23.353
Aytolun is my half mother.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.853
Every bad word you told
them burns our nomad tent.

01:20:29.386 --> 01:20:31.086
You should know that this time you
are burning not only our nomad tent

01:20:31.253 --> 01:20:32.620
but also Hayme Mother's tent, as well.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:34.953
As soon as Gundogdu is hurt

01:20:35.153 --> 01:20:37.586
two nomad tents would not find peace,
you should know.

01:20:40.386 --> 01:20:41.420
If you will excuse me.

01:21:00.586 --> 01:21:03.320
For all our sins, forgive us!

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:04.820
Forgive us!

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:07.053
-Forgive us!
-Forgive us!

01:21:07.453 --> 01:21:09.486
-Forgive us!
-Forgive us!

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.420
There is no god but God

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:34.953
and Muhammad is the messenger of God.

01:21:42.586 --> 01:21:43.986
Gokce, daughter of Alptekin

01:21:45.586 --> 01:21:49.820
do you accept Tugtekin,
son of Korkut, to your wed

01:21:50.053 --> 01:21:54.086
in return for him giving you
ten dirham gold and 20 sheep?

01:21:56.053 --> 01:21:57.920
-I do.
-Do you accept?

01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.886
-I do.
-Do you accept?

01:22:00.353 --> 01:22:01.353
I do.

01:22:02.486 --> 01:22:06.886
Tugtekin, son of Korkut,
do you accept to marry Gokce

01:22:07.453 --> 01:22:11.120
daughter of Alptekin with your promise?

01:22:11.586 --> 01:22:13.153
-I do.
-Do you accept?

01:22:13.586 --> 01:22:15.286
-I do.
-Do you accept?

01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.020
I do.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:21.120
You, witnesses, do you testify?

01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:22.920
-We do.
-We do.

01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:30.886
God blesses your marriage.

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:32.920
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:36.053
With the name of God.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:42.120
God, we testified these
two people's marriage.

01:22:42.486 --> 01:22:43.853
You testify, as well.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:47.020
My Maker, bless their marriage.

01:22:47.253 --> 01:22:48.320
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:22:48.486 --> 01:22:53.253
Please give this couple love, harmony
and constancy in their marriage.

01:22:53.553 --> 01:22:54.820
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:22:54.986 --> 01:22:58.620
Do not let them have fights,
derangement and separation.

01:22:59.053 --> 01:23:00.053
Amen!

01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:01.220
My God!

01:23:01.453 --> 01:23:06.353
Let this couple have the familiarity...

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:11.320
...and constancy
and conservation that...

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:15.386
...His Holiness Adam and Eve...

01:23:16.186 --> 01:23:21.953
...and His Holiness Mohammed Mustapha
and Mother Hatice...

01:23:22.286 --> 01:23:25.086
...and His Holiness Ali
and Fatima had.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.320
Amen.

01:23:26.486 --> 01:23:29.486
God! Endower our
beautiful two people...

01:23:29.886 --> 01:23:34.120
...good sons,
long lives and plenty of food.

01:23:34.553 --> 01:23:35.853
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:23:36.153 --> 01:23:41.886
God, enlighten our wives
and children to us.

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:43.120
Amen.

01:23:43.286 --> 01:23:47.153
And lead us to those who bewares
to defy the God.

01:23:47.453 --> 01:23:48.553
-Amen.
-God!

01:23:49.186 --> 01:23:53.320
Give us goodness, beauty
and blessings on earth.

01:23:53.586 --> 01:23:54.586
Amen.

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.120
Give us goodness, beauty and blessings
in the afterlife, as well.

01:23:57.853 --> 01:24:00.453
Protect us from the torment of fire.
-Amen.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.486
Your God, with puissance and honor is away

01:24:04.886 --> 01:24:08.020
and supreme then their qualification.

01:24:08.353 --> 01:24:10.186
Greetings to Prophets.

01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:14.586
All is pertained to the God of universe.

01:24:40.253 --> 01:24:42.153
God blesses your marriage.

01:24:42.486 --> 01:24:43.486
Amen.

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:47.886
With the name of God.

01:25:00.086 --> 01:25:03.486
The only son of my tent
and family, Tugtekin

01:25:04.453 --> 01:25:08.020
bring a worthy son and daughter
into the world.

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:12.953
May God make you happy and fortunate
in here and after.

01:25:13.486 --> 01:25:15.353
Amen, father. Amen.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.920
May you and your kin last long.

01:25:24.386 --> 01:25:25.986
Have a long lasting Marriage,
if God permits.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.520
Amen.

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:32.953
Be very happy, my daughter.

01:25:38.953 --> 01:25:40.153
Congratulations, my uncle's son.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.453
I hope you will give birth to beautiful
girls like you and brave sons like him.

01:25:47.153 --> 01:25:48.420
Thank you, Aytolun Hanim.

01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:00.320
-Congratulations to you, my uncle's son.
-Thank you.

01:26:04.419 --> 01:26:05.586
I wish you a happy marriage.

01:26:08.453 --> 01:26:10.286
-Be happy.
-Thank you, Bey.

01:26:21.986 --> 01:26:25.820
May your lives be full of welfare.
May trouble be away from you, sister.

01:26:26.253 --> 01:26:27.286
My sister!

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:30.553
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:26:30.953 --> 01:26:32.220
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.253
Long live! Long live!

01:26:34.586 --> 01:26:37.220
May you and your kin last long!

01:26:37.486 --> 01:26:39.020
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:26:39.286 --> 01:26:40.520
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:26:40.986 --> 01:26:42.453
Long live! Long live!

01:26:42.953 --> 01:26:45.453
May you and your kin last long!

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.186
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:26:47.486 --> 01:26:48.920
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:50.820
Long live! Long live!

01:26:51.286 --> 01:26:53.853
May you and your kin last long!

01:27:54.053 --> 01:27:56.353
-Come on!
-Come on!

01:28:55.553 --> 01:28:56.986
You know what to do.

01:28:58.220 --> 01:28:59.253
I know, aunt.

01:29:00.853 --> 01:29:01.953
Do not worry.

01:29:03.386 --> 01:29:07.253
However, I am worried about you, aunt.

01:29:12.486 --> 01:29:15.253
Do not worry. I will be fine.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:18.953
Let us end this.

01:29:20.986 --> 01:29:21.986
Let us end.

01:29:47.353 --> 01:29:49.986
What did Tugtekin Bey do?

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:54.453
He pitched a tent to Kok Alacimen!

01:29:56.153 --> 01:29:59.853
What did he do for his beloved one?

01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:04.986
He broke stud from horse,
wheat from camel, ram from sheep!

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:09.853
Did he break heart? Did he talk bad?

01:30:10.853 --> 01:30:13.186
He neither broke heart nor talked bad!

01:30:13.453 --> 01:30:17.520
He asked! He entered the bridal
chamber and attained his desire!

01:30:52.853 --> 01:30:57.220
God blesses your marriage!

01:30:57.886 --> 01:30:58.986
Amen!

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.220
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:31:01.553 --> 01:31:03.020
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:05.020
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:31:05.353 --> 01:31:06.953
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:31:07.386 --> 01:31:08.886
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.820
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:31:11.153 --> 01:31:12.586
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:31:13.186 --> 01:31:14.586
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:31:15.153 --> 01:31:16.520
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.453
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:20.453
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:22.386
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:31:23.053 --> 01:31:24.420
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:31:25.086 --> 01:31:26.486
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:28.386
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.320
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:31:30.953 --> 01:31:32.320
Long live, Tugtekin Bey!

01:31:32.886 --> 01:31:34.320
Long live, Gokce Hatun!

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:08.253
Thank God, we have seen
our son's marriage.

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:16.186
What bothers you in a blessed day
like this?

01:32:18.386 --> 01:32:19.386
Selcan.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.186
<i>Do I have permission, Bey?</i>

01:32:22.586 --> 01:32:23.620
Come in, daughter.

01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:31.553
I prepared wedding sherbet, Bey.

01:32:32.286 --> 01:32:34.120
If you allow, I shall offer you.

01:32:34.486 --> 01:32:35.520
Give me, daughter.

01:32:55.853 --> 01:32:59.553
I prepared this for the two families
with Tugtekin Bey and Gokce Hatun.

01:33:14.086 --> 01:33:15.153
Thank you, daughter.

01:33:17.586 --> 01:33:20.120
Banu Cicek, you shall wait by the door.

01:33:38.986 --> 01:33:39.986
We shall drink.

01:33:44.453 --> 01:33:49.920
So that their lives will be sweet
like this sherbet.

01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:41.020
The necklace that my deceased mother gave
to Hayme and Hayme gave to Selcan...

01:34:42.986 --> 01:34:45.186
Why is it in our marquee, Aytolun?

01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:58.420
What kind of lies did Selcan
poison you again with?

01:34:59.086 --> 01:35:05.086
She says that Duru's sudden death is
not fate, you poisoned her.

01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:13.253
Is this true?

01:35:17.886 --> 01:35:20.886
You, Bey, you do not hear what you say.

01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:25.553
Answer me!

01:35:27.386 --> 01:35:28.420
Answer!

01:35:36.586 --> 01:35:37.920
What did you put in this?

01:35:44.353 --> 01:35:46.120
More than what I gave to Duru!

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:50.620
Why?

01:35:54.586 --> 01:35:57.453
It fell to me and my brother to do

01:35:58.053 --> 01:36:01.353
what is required when we understood
that a diffident and coward man

01:36:02.186 --> 01:36:04.386
like you cannot rule the margrave.

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:15.053
Help, Banu Cicek! Run!

01:36:15.986 --> 01:36:17.020
Korkut Bey!

01:36:18.186 --> 01:36:19.186
Bey!

01:36:22.153 --> 01:36:24.020
I shall let Artuk Bey know. Hurry!

01:36:28.886 --> 01:36:31.953
Murderer! You poisoned my Bey!
Why did you do that?

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:33.353
Look at me, witch!

01:36:33.553 --> 01:36:36.620
I do not know what you do,
but I will let Artuk Bey know.

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:38.353
Bey is dying!

01:36:38.953 --> 01:36:40.453
Only your body can leave here.

01:36:43.853 --> 01:36:46.053
Guards! Guards!

01:36:51.253 --> 01:36:53.153
Murderer! She poisoned us!

01:36:54.253 --> 01:36:55.320
Kill her!

01:36:56.286 --> 01:36:57.353
Save our Bey!

01:36:58.253 --> 01:36:59.520
Banu Cicek...

01:37:03.986 --> 01:37:07.253
Bey? Let Artuk Bey know! Hurry! Hurry!

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.486
Bey? Bey? Aytolun Hatun?

01:37:46.386 --> 01:37:47.586
I am thankful to God

01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:52.020
for giving me a woman like you.

01:37:55.353 --> 01:37:59.920
I am thankful to God for being the
woman of a man like you, Bey.

01:38:03.553 --> 01:38:06.620
May you and your kin last long.

01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:09.953
May my life be sacrificed for you.

01:38:24.453 --> 01:38:26.286
Bey? Bey?

01:38:27.586 --> 01:38:30.020
Slowly. With the name of God.

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:32.120
Slowly.

01:38:38.086 --> 01:38:40.886
Bring the box with black herbs
from the Isakisfa tent. Now.

01:38:41.086 --> 01:38:42.120
Okay, Bey.

01:38:49.953 --> 01:38:51.586
Did you inform Mother Hayme
and Gumustekin?

01:38:52.153 --> 01:38:53.186
We did, Bey.

01:38:54.953 --> 01:38:58.020
Turn him over. Turn. Turn.

01:38:59.486 --> 01:39:01.820
-Brother!
-Relax, Bey. Relax.

01:39:02.953 --> 01:39:04.120
Aytolun!

01:39:05.586 --> 01:39:06.620
My sister!

01:39:07.386 --> 01:39:09.920
Aunt! Brother! Brother!

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:11.420
Aytolun!

01:39:12.853 --> 01:39:13.886
Mother!

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:16.953
What happened to you, sister?

01:39:24.086 --> 01:39:26.286
Aytolun, sister, what happened to you?

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:31.186
What happened here, Artuk Bey?

01:39:32.386 --> 01:39:35.920
Stay away. They hardly breathe, obviously,
they are both poisoned.

01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:37.120
What?

01:39:44.886 --> 01:39:46.886
Who did this to you, sister, who?

01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:50.386
Banu Cicek did it, Bey.

01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:54.220
Both Korkut Bey and Aytolun Hatun
said it before they fainted.

01:39:57.886 --> 01:39:58.986
Aunt! Uncle!

01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:02.820
Bey! Bey, be a little patient
for God's sake!

01:40:03.353 --> 01:40:05.253
First we should find out the truth!

01:40:05.453 --> 01:40:08.320
What is there to find out, Bey?
Is not everything obvious?

01:40:08.486 --> 01:40:10.986
-It is not, Bey! For God's sake!
-Let go of me!

01:40:11.153 --> 01:40:12.386
-Ertugrul!
-Let go of me!

01:40:12.553 --> 01:40:14.486
-Take her away.
-Sungur, Kaya, help me.

01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:21.220
Ertugrul Bey, we shall inform Tugtekin
Bey as well. They are not good.

01:40:21.986 --> 01:40:23.020
Of course, Artuk Bey.

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:26.253
I do not know if they will survive.
They must come and see them.

01:41:38.386 --> 01:41:39.386
You are halal to me.

01:41:41.386 --> 01:41:44.353
You are the hope for my tent
and margrave now.

01:41:46.253 --> 01:41:49.286
I hope you will keep my kin alive.

01:41:53.453 --> 01:41:55.353
This is the heritage of
my deceased mother, Gokce.

01:41:57.553 --> 01:41:58.886
May you carry it your whole life.

01:42:04.486 --> 01:42:05.520
<i>Tugtekin Bey!</i>

01:42:07.886 --> 01:42:08.886
Bogac?

01:42:09.086 --> 01:42:11.453
<i>Bey! It is Korkut Bey and Aytolun Hatun!</i>

01:42:12.086 --> 01:42:13.953
<i>Artuk Bey told you to come at once!</i>

01:42:42.486 --> 01:42:44.320
You will be fine brother,
you will be fine.

01:42:45.553 --> 01:42:46.620
You will be fine.

01:42:58.286 --> 01:43:00.386
Open, Bey. Open your mouth.

01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:05.019
With the name of God.

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.286
With the name of God.

01:43:12.953 --> 01:43:14.086
Drink, aunt, drink.

01:43:21.519 --> 01:43:22.519
Father!

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:25.120
Father!

01:43:26.453 --> 01:43:27.453
Father.

01:43:29.353 --> 01:43:31.986
Please tell me he will survive, Artuk Bey.
Please.

01:43:32.253 --> 01:43:33.986
You should be prepared for anything, Bey.

01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:42.420
Father!

01:43:50.053 --> 01:43:51.053
Mother!

01:43:51.986 --> 01:43:54.953
You will be okay, mother.
Mother, please open your eyes.

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.120
Mother!

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:06.086
Everybody, out. There is not enough
air inside. Out, now.

01:44:06.453 --> 01:44:09.886
Come on, daughter. Come on. Come on.

01:44:11.253 --> 01:44:15.453
Tugtekin, come here.
Come here son, let's go out.

01:44:28.286 --> 01:44:29.420
Where is Banu Cicek?

01:44:29.886 --> 01:44:33.053
She is held captive inside.
There is Ertugrul and Kaya Alp with her.

01:44:33.386 --> 01:44:34.953
Come, my son, come.

01:44:36.353 --> 01:44:37.353
Tugtekin!

01:44:47.453 --> 01:44:49.153
Tugtekin, brother, do not!

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:51.420
-I will kill this woman, let me go!
-Do not do it, brother.

01:44:51.586 --> 01:44:52.920
-Let me go!
-Do not.

01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:59.586
After we learn why she did it,
she will pay for it eventually.

01:45:00.286 --> 01:45:01.286
Do not worry.

01:45:05.086 --> 01:45:06.253
Leave, brother, leave.

01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:11.920
Bogac, Samsa, brother, take her to the
caged tent. It is not working here.

01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:53.553
What did Dogan Alp do?

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.986
He pitched a tent to Kok Alacimen!

01:46:00.353 --> 01:46:05.153
What did he do for his beloved Banu Cicek?

01:46:05.886 --> 01:46:11.120
He broke stud from horse,
wheat from camel, ram from sheep!

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:18.986
-I hope we will see those days.
-If God permits.

01:46:19.153 --> 01:46:20.453
If God permits, brother.

01:46:22.253 --> 01:46:23.320
Banu Cicek?

01:46:26.086 --> 01:46:27.186
What is it?

01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:30.320
Banu Cicek?

01:46:31.286 --> 01:46:33.953
I did not do it, Dogan Alp. I am innocent.

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:37.020
She is still talking! She poisoned Bey
and his wife in front of our eyes!

01:46:37.253 --> 01:46:39.886
She still says she is innocent!
Move, you prick, move!

01:46:40.053 --> 01:46:42.186
Dogan, stop! Do not!

01:46:43.086 --> 01:46:44.186
Leave me!

01:46:44.353 --> 01:46:45.986
-Stop, Dogan.
-Stop, brother.

01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:52.186
Dogan! Dogan!

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:55.253
-Where are you going, brother?
-Dogan!

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.620
What is happening, brother?
What should we do now?

01:47:08.853 --> 01:47:10.353
Why this girl did something like this?

01:47:11.153 --> 01:47:13.520
Is it not enough to know
the killer, Hayme Hatun?

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.920
It is not important
if Banu Cicek did this.

01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:21.020
The important thing is why would
Banu Cicek do something like this?

01:47:21.186 --> 01:47:22.386
We must find this out.

01:47:25.853 --> 01:47:29.086
She loves Duru more than her mother
as well as she loves my brother.

01:47:30.886 --> 01:47:32.620
So, why did she do something like this?

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:36.353
I cannot imagine.

01:47:38.853 --> 01:47:39.986
As my mother said

01:47:43.353 --> 01:47:45.820
we should find out
who is in interest of this.

01:47:49.453 --> 01:47:50.920
You are quite right, Ertugrul Bey.

01:47:51.986 --> 01:47:54.286
Who knows, what else they used her for?

01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:58.220
Is that right, Sungurtekin Bey?

01:48:02.153 --> 01:48:03.953
I shall go, check her tent.

01:48:04.553 --> 01:48:05.953
Let us see what we will find.

01:48:19.953 --> 01:48:20.986
My dear sister.

01:48:23.286 --> 01:48:25.053
I hope you will be happy.

01:48:29.486 --> 01:48:34.320
I hope you will give birth to many sons

01:48:34.853 --> 01:48:36.353
worthy of Suleyman Shah.

01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:45.920
What did you do, Selcan Hatun? What?

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.953
What kind of evil you have inside?

01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:50.486
What are you saying, Dogan brother?

01:48:51.453 --> 01:48:54.520
They say Banu Cicek poisoned
Korkut Bey and Aytolun Hatun.

01:48:56.486 --> 01:48:58.820
How did you poison her mind?

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:01.020
How could you ruin her life, Selcan Hatun?

01:49:01.253 --> 01:49:04.386
Brother Dogan, stop for a second!
Tell me over again, please!

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.953
Korkut Bey and Aytolun Hatun
are struggling with death.

01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:14.220
What do you say? It is not possible!

01:49:17.086 --> 01:49:19.220
Shame on you! Shame!

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.120
Dogan!

01:50:11.286 --> 01:50:12.286
Bey.

01:50:44.971 --> 01:50:46.571
Korkut Bey's condition is critical.

01:50:47.738 --> 01:50:49.505
I drew too much blood out of his body.

01:50:50.171 --> 01:50:54.505
If I draw a little more, I am afraid
he will die of blood loss.

01:50:58.205 --> 01:50:59.538
I did everything I could.

01:51:02.938 --> 01:51:04.505
Will my brother get better, Artuk Bey?

01:51:06.071 --> 01:51:08.771
Unless I know what kind of a poison it is,
I can not say anything Gumustekin Bey.

01:51:18.205 --> 01:51:19.238
I have found this in his tent.

01:51:34.138 --> 01:51:35.305
Just as I guessed.

01:51:36.938 --> 01:51:38.271
This is the most dangerous poison of all.

01:51:39.805 --> 01:51:44.205
It shows its curse instantly, but
does not leave any trace behind.

01:51:46.138 --> 01:51:49.838
If they were sleeping last night,
we would find both their corpses.

01:51:51.171 --> 01:51:53.171
And there would be no trace left behind.

01:52:01.305 --> 01:52:03.838
Go, you do not need to wait here.

01:52:04.971 --> 01:52:06.071
Go back to your tents.

01:52:07.538 --> 01:52:09.138
We can not do anything but to pray.

01:52:28.638 --> 01:52:29.705
Korkut Bey.

01:52:32.605 --> 01:52:33.671
Forgive me, Bey.

01:52:37.138 --> 01:52:39.205
I wish I would die instead of you.

01:52:41.638 --> 01:52:42.738
I could not protect you.

01:53:05.971 --> 01:53:07.071
Are you going to say that you
did not do it?

01:53:09.038 --> 01:53:10.738
It does not matter
what I say, Gundogdu Bey.

01:53:13.171 --> 01:53:16.305
You poisoned Korkut Bey and Aytulun Hatun,
in the presence of the Alps.

01:53:18.905 --> 01:53:19.905
These are lies, Bey.

01:53:23.838 --> 01:53:26.538
What about the poison vial that
I have found in your tent?

01:53:28.105 --> 01:53:29.105
Is that a lie too?

01:53:32.071 --> 01:53:33.705
They used me, Gundogdu Bey.

01:53:38.005 --> 01:53:42.838
If you want to find out the truth,
there is only one person who knows it.

01:53:44.205 --> 01:53:45.505
Selcan Hatun.

01:53:46.638 --> 01:53:49.638
Go to her, Bey. She will
tell you everything.

01:54:32.171 --> 01:54:33.171
Brother?

01:54:49.738 --> 01:54:50.771
Dogan?

01:54:53.871 --> 01:54:55.305
Banu Cicek did not do this, my brothers.

01:54:57.138 --> 01:54:59.171
Banu Cicek would sacrifice her life
for his Bey.

01:55:00.171 --> 01:55:02.905
She would sacrifice her soul. But she
would never poison him.

01:55:32.205 --> 01:55:33.771
Did you hear about what happened
to Banu Cicek?

01:55:35.105 --> 01:55:36.171
Yes, I have heard of it, Bey.

01:55:37.838 --> 01:55:39.071
Do you have anything to say?

01:55:40.071 --> 01:55:41.571
I know that your heart belongs to her.

01:55:44.205 --> 01:55:45.238
Yes, I have, Bey.

01:55:46.305 --> 01:55:48.805
Despite all these slanders,
she still owns my heart.

01:55:49.871 --> 01:55:50.871
Tell me then.

01:55:51.771 --> 01:55:54.538
Tell me, so that there will be nothing
left uncovered.

01:55:55.871 --> 01:55:57.238
Tomorrow morning she will be questioned.

01:55:58.905 --> 01:56:00.005
This is her last chance.

01:56:02.838 --> 01:56:06.805
I promised Selcan Hatun that
I would not say anything to anyone.

01:56:07.105 --> 01:56:08.205
Selcan Hatun?

01:56:10.938 --> 01:56:11.938
Yes, Bey.

01:56:15.271 --> 01:56:18.638
Aytolun Hatun has been up to devilish
plans in Korkut Bey's marquee.

01:56:19.605 --> 01:56:21.138
In order to reveal the truth,
Selcan Hatun has needed to...

01:56:22.238 --> 01:56:25.205
...get back her necklace
that she left in the marquee.

01:56:26.271 --> 01:56:27.905
She has asked Banu Cicek for help.

01:56:28.771 --> 01:56:31.238
But after Banu Cicek has said that
she would not betray her Bey...

01:56:31.838 --> 01:56:34.838
...she came to ask my help.
I also talked to her.

01:56:35.505 --> 01:56:38.538
But again, she did not agree with it.

01:56:39.771 --> 01:56:42.505
Afterwards, all these happened, Bey.

01:56:59.171 --> 01:57:01.638
How? How? My God, how?

01:57:05.205 --> 01:57:06.205
Selcan!

01:57:09.938 --> 01:57:10.971
Tell me everything!

01:57:12.238 --> 01:57:15.605
Tell me or I will cut you into pieces
like a sheep to the slaughter! Tell me!

01:57:18.038 --> 01:57:22.638
Before Aunt Duru died, Aytolun was the
lover of Uncle Korkut, Bey!

01:57:23.938 --> 01:57:25.038
Say your last prayer, woman!

01:57:25.305 --> 01:57:26.938
Say your last prayer because
I will kill you right here!

01:57:27.171 --> 01:57:30.105
Unless I kill you, there is no peace
neither for me nor for our nomad group!

01:57:30.771 --> 01:57:32.905
Kill me! Slice my throat right now!

01:57:34.038 --> 01:57:35.671
Slaughter me, and both of us will
be freed!

01:57:36.105 --> 01:57:39.538
If you are going to search for peace
by hiding behind lies, go ahead!

01:57:40.671 --> 01:57:44.105
Sacrifice me right here! Ease your heart!

01:57:44.971 --> 01:57:49.071
But if you have a little courage in your
heart, listen to me, my Gundogdu.

01:57:49.738 --> 01:57:51.138
Tell me then! Tell me!

01:57:53.605 --> 01:57:55.605
-Brother, do not do it!
-Do not get close, Ertugrul.

01:57:56.005 --> 01:57:57.638
I am so tired of this already.

01:57:58.571 --> 01:57:59.571
Speak!

01:58:00.805 --> 01:58:03.571
Reemember the corpse of that old woman
we found outside the nomad tent?

01:58:05.238 --> 01:58:07.005
Her killer is Aytolun, Bey.

01:58:10.138 --> 01:58:13.138
<i>Aytolun, you killed her!</i>

01:58:13.671 --> 01:58:14.971
<i>Murderer! Murderer!</i>

01:58:15.671 --> 01:58:19.505
<i>Let me go! I am telling you she is</i>
 <i>a murderer, she killed her! Murderer!</i>

01:58:25.638 --> 01:58:29.205
The old woman talked to me. She was going
to say more but asked for gold to speak.

01:58:29.871 --> 01:58:32.238
She was not satisfied with the necklace
that Mother Hayme gave her.

01:58:32.905 --> 01:58:34.071
Her greed was the cause of her death.

01:58:34.705 --> 01:58:36.771
I came back to the tent to get her gold...

01:58:37.738 --> 01:58:39.305
...so that she would tell us more, Bey...

01:58:40.571 --> 01:58:42.271
...but when I went back, she was
already dead.

01:58:42.605 --> 01:58:44.538
You are telling me these so that
I would not take Goncagul.

01:58:45.871 --> 01:58:49.738
Somehow Goncagul has found the necklace,
and she threatened me.

01:58:51.138 --> 01:58:52.938
She accused me of killing the old woman.

01:58:53.238 --> 01:58:58.238
She said that she would not say anything
to protect the honour of Gundogdu Bey.

01:58:58.705 --> 01:58:59.905
But she is lying, Bey.

01:59:00.838 --> 01:59:03.571
Aytolun killed the old woman,
Goncagul knows that too!

01:59:04.571 --> 01:59:06.971
Brother! Brother, please do not do this.

01:59:08.671 --> 01:59:10.271
Brother, stop! Brother! Brother, stop!

01:59:26.871 --> 01:59:28.671
That devil is the one who poisoned my
Uncle too.

01:59:38.005 --> 01:59:39.505
I almost believed you.

01:59:40.305 --> 01:59:44.005
Seeds of suspicion that you sow in me,
almost sprouted.

01:59:44.971 --> 01:59:46.905
But the devil inside you is still alive.

01:59:48.271 --> 01:59:51.038
Aytolun is also fighting for her life,
right beside Korkut Bey, Selcan.

01:59:53.305 --> 01:59:56.305
God damn the day I took you in
my marquee, woman!

01:59:57.005 --> 01:59:59.038
-Damn you! God damn!
-Brother!

01:59:59.838 --> 02:00:01.871
Brother calm down, pull yourself together.

02:00:02.905 --> 02:00:04.605
We will learn what happened
during the interrogation tomorrow.

02:00:05.905 --> 02:00:07.671
Tomorrow, you will be questioned too!

02:00:08.738 --> 02:00:10.171
Take this off my hand,
before I do anything bad.

02:00:25.771 --> 02:00:28.238
Now tell me everything from the
very beginning, Selcan Hatun.

02:00:32.571 --> 02:00:34.671
The one who poisoned them
was not Banu Cicek, Bey.

02:00:35.505 --> 02:00:38.538
That girl is innocent.
I swear she did not do it.

02:00:40.271 --> 02:00:42.738
Why do you think that Aytolun
killed Aunt Duru?

02:00:43.938 --> 02:00:45.171
Did that old woman tell you this?

02:00:47.971 --> 02:00:48.971
Then?

02:00:50.705 --> 02:00:53.605
Nobody told me, I did not see it either.

02:00:54.971 --> 02:00:57.871
But I know, Bey. I know.

02:01:00.071 --> 02:01:01.871
A voice in my heart tells me so.

02:01:05.238 --> 02:01:06.705
Aytolun is a murderer.

02:01:24.905 --> 02:01:26.138
I know, I acted foolishly.

02:01:28.005 --> 02:01:29.571
But you should not be angry
with me, mother.

02:01:30.605 --> 02:01:33.971
You should know that both Selcan and I
tried for the justice to be served.

02:01:35.071 --> 02:01:36.705
But we could not know that
this would happen.

02:01:38.105 --> 02:01:39.571
Is this better now, Halime?

02:01:41.238 --> 02:01:45.038
Did you think that you would solve
everything by acting on the sly?

02:01:46.205 --> 02:01:49.738
How could you do this, by
ignoring me and your husbands?

02:02:00.271 --> 02:02:01.571
I talked to Selcan.

02:02:02.571 --> 02:02:03.838
She told me everything.

02:02:04.838 --> 02:02:06.105
She said that you also knew it all.

02:02:07.138 --> 02:02:08.605
Forgive me, Ertugrul Bey.

02:02:09.638 --> 02:02:12.071
Selcan told me to wait until
the wedding for her to tell everything.

02:02:13.238 --> 02:02:14.505
That is why I could not tell you.

02:02:14.738 --> 02:02:16.905
How can you keep secrets
from your Bey, Halime Sultan?

02:02:18.738 --> 02:02:19.738
How can this be?

02:02:25.771 --> 02:02:29.505
If you have told me everything in the
beginning, things would not get this far.

02:02:31.938 --> 02:02:33.005
Look at us!

02:02:33.771 --> 02:02:36.605
Look at what I hear while my
brother is fighting for his life!

02:02:37.305 --> 02:02:38.905
My God, I am about to lose my mind!

02:02:39.771 --> 02:02:43.038
My nomad tent turned into a cesspool,
and my daughter is involved in it!

02:03:07.871 --> 02:03:08.871
Mother!

02:03:12.638 --> 02:03:13.638
Mother.

02:03:18.271 --> 02:03:20.705
I never abandoned my Nasuh repentence...

02:03:21.738 --> 02:03:25.205
...or the promise I made
to Ibnul Arabi, mother.

02:03:28.671 --> 02:03:31.671
Whatever it is that you have heard, I am
standing behind my words.

02:03:33.238 --> 02:03:35.571
I will tell everything I know, tomorrow.

02:03:36.905 --> 02:03:39.805
If you tell a single lie...

02:03:41.571 --> 02:03:42.805
...I will not let you live here

02:03:43.905 --> 02:03:49.105
...or in any other Turkmen nomad group,
Selcan.

02:04:17.238 --> 02:04:18.238
Dear God.

02:04:20.238 --> 02:04:23.038
I have no one left to take refuge in
but You.

02:04:25.705 --> 02:04:28.705
I beg you, please guide
to Ertugrul Bey.

02:04:30.505 --> 02:04:31.805
Guide him so that...

02:04:32.671 --> 02:04:35.505
...he can save us all from this malice.

02:05:00.571 --> 02:05:01.871
I would like to see Banu Cicek.

02:05:03.805 --> 02:05:07.005
Tugtekin Bey gave us order. He told us to
not to let anyone in, Bey.

02:05:07.705 --> 02:05:11.805
I have some questions to ask this girl
who is said to have poisoned...

02:05:13.205 --> 02:05:14.205
...-my uncle and my aunt.
-Bey.

02:05:32.805 --> 02:05:35.171
Why did you do this to a man who has been
a father to you, Banu Cicek?

02:05:36.071 --> 02:05:40.171
Bey, I did not make an attempt neither on
Korkut Bey's nor or Aytolun Hatun's life.

02:05:41.838 --> 02:05:44.571
I am innocent. That is all I have to say.

02:05:47.538 --> 02:05:48.871
What is Selcan Hatun's position in this?

02:05:51.005 --> 02:05:52.171
She told me everything.

02:05:54.705 --> 02:05:56.538
Selcan Hatun is not involved in this.

02:05:57.971 --> 02:05:59.505
I believe everything she says.

02:06:00.871 --> 02:06:03.571
Sooner or later, poetic justice will be
manifested.

02:06:07.171 --> 02:06:09.571
Do you trust in the court that
will be set, Banu Cicek?

02:06:11.838 --> 02:06:12.838
Never.

02:06:15.805 --> 02:06:21.305
Bey, I trust in God first and then you.

02:06:24.605 --> 02:06:27.005
The one who poisoned Korkut Bey
is Aytolun Hatun.

02:06:28.505 --> 02:06:29.738
She put the blame on me.

02:06:30.638 --> 02:06:32.871
So what, this woman poisoned
herself as well?

02:06:35.305 --> 02:06:37.071
Anything may be expected from that demon.

02:06:40.805 --> 02:06:45.838
Bey, I know that I will be executed
sooner or later.

02:06:48.138 --> 02:06:51.171
You should take revenge not only for me...

02:06:52.105 --> 02:06:54.205
...but for Korkut Bey and Duru Hatun
as well.

02:06:57.905 --> 02:06:59.605
I do not have anything else to say.

02:08:05.305 --> 02:08:06.805
What is their condition, Artuk Bey?

02:08:09.805 --> 02:08:12.738
There is nothing else to do
except for praying and waiting.

02:08:17.971 --> 02:08:19.205
But as for Aytolun Hatun...

02:08:20.805 --> 02:08:22.605
...she obviously drank only a little
of that sirup.

02:08:23.305 --> 02:08:25.271
If God permits, she will recover.

02:08:28.205 --> 02:08:29.805
I did everything I could.

02:08:45.005 --> 02:08:46.005
It seems

02:08:47.705 --> 02:08:51.138
that you looked for the thief in your
marquee in the wrong place, Hayme Hatun.

02:08:54.071 --> 02:08:56.838
The one who is responsible for all
of this is Banu Cicek.

02:08:58.771 --> 02:09:01.671
Let us pray that everything will come to
light in the interrogation.

02:09:02.238 --> 02:09:03.505
Without the need of the court.

02:09:05.805 --> 02:09:08.938
What you should do is not to be biased.

02:09:11.671 --> 02:09:15.971
Otherwise, when the court is set,
I will ask for a judge from Konya.

02:09:17.738 --> 02:09:18.838
You should know that.

02:09:51.838 --> 02:09:54.771
If you allow us, I would like to start
the questioning, Hayme Hatun.

02:09:59.971 --> 02:10:00.971
Bring her.

02:10:18.705 --> 02:10:21.505
We would like to solve this matter
before the trial starts.

02:10:24.205 --> 02:10:25.738
Your crime seems obvious.

02:10:27.705 --> 02:10:30.238
Confess and save us all from this trouble.

02:10:32.138 --> 02:10:33.205
I am innocent.

02:10:35.138 --> 02:10:37.271
I will tell everything I know at the
court.

02:10:39.771 --> 02:10:40.871
What are you going to tell?

02:10:43.638 --> 02:10:45.071
Will you tell how did you give them
the poison?

02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:47.871
-Tugtekin Bey.
-Or how you attempted their lives?

02:10:48.038 --> 02:10:50.071
-What are you going to tell?
-Tugtekin Bey.

02:10:56.571 --> 02:10:58.105
We are all devastated.

02:10:58.905 --> 02:11:01.005
But we are here in order to solve
this case.

02:11:07.605 --> 02:11:10.705
Why are you waiting for the court?
Tell us now.

02:11:16.271 --> 02:11:17.505
That night...

02:11:18.005 --> 02:11:22.271
...after I gave the wedlock sherbet
to Korkut Bey and Aytolun Hatun...

02:11:23.538 --> 02:11:24.571
...I left the marquee.

02:11:27.171 --> 02:11:31.171
Sometime later, Aytolun Hatun,
cried out for me.

02:11:34.171 --> 02:11:37.571
I went in and saw that Korkut Bey
was on the floor.

02:11:42.205 --> 02:11:43.238
He was In the throes of death.

02:11:45.571 --> 02:11:49.571
Aytolun Hatun attacked me with her dagger,
saying that I poisoned him.

02:11:52.171 --> 02:11:56.305
So, I fought back for self defense.

02:11:58.871 --> 02:12:00.171
Guardian Alps came in.

02:12:02.005 --> 02:12:03.705
They hit my head and I had fainted.

02:12:06.005 --> 02:12:08.638
When I opened my eyes, they were
taking me to the caged tent.

02:12:11.938 --> 02:12:13.238
That is all I have to say.

02:12:14.971 --> 02:12:16.271
I have committed no sins.

02:12:17.771 --> 02:12:18.805
I am innocent.

02:12:24.538 --> 02:12:25.538
Gundogdu Bey.

02:12:26.938 --> 02:12:28.838
As the head of the Alps
who carries out this inqury...

02:12:29.038 --> 02:12:30.871
...do you have anything to say
to this woman?

02:12:39.638 --> 02:12:41.905
-Blend them together.
-Alright.

02:12:42.238 --> 02:12:43.238
Bey?

02:12:44.905 --> 02:12:45.905
Bey?

02:12:46.805 --> 02:12:47.838
Korkut Bey?

02:12:51.238 --> 02:12:52.271
Slowly, Bey.

02:12:54.605 --> 02:12:55.605
Do not tire yourself, Bey.

02:13:04.938 --> 02:13:07.238
About the poison vial that I found
in your tent...

02:13:08.671 --> 02:13:11.138
Artuk Bey says that the poison was used.

02:13:13.505 --> 02:13:17.505
Tell us, why was that vial in your tent?

02:13:19.305 --> 02:13:20.905
Whoever did this...

02:13:21.905 --> 02:13:23.271
...put the vial in there as well.

02:13:30.971 --> 02:13:33.505
After putting the poison in the
wedlock sherbet...

02:13:34.871 --> 02:13:39.071
...why did you feel the need to take the
vial into your tent?

02:13:47.605 --> 02:13:48.805
What is your problem, Ertugrul?

02:13:50.171 --> 02:13:52.871
Is it your job to protect this women
who attempted on my father's life?

02:13:59.271 --> 02:14:00.505
Also...

02:14:02.271 --> 02:14:04.238
...while serving Bey and Hanim
in the marquee...

02:14:05.138 --> 02:14:07.005
...when did you have the chance to go and
hide the vile in your tent?

02:14:13.705 --> 02:14:16.671
Obviously, the ones who organized
this ruse...

02:14:18.238 --> 02:14:23.638
is trying to make a fool of me and
everyone here.

02:14:26.605 --> 02:14:28.738
God willing, after Korkut Bey recovers...

02:14:30.305 --> 02:14:32.738
...he will surely be able to find them
and ask them to pay the price...

02:14:33.105 --> 02:14:34.205
...for what they have done.

02:14:46.138 --> 02:14:49.771
When Alps were taking Tugtekin and Gokce
to their tents with torches...

02:14:50.538 --> 02:14:52.171
...you were there as well, were you not?

02:14:57.238 --> 02:15:01.938
So you took that opportunity to take
the vial in your tent, did you not?

02:15:02.671 --> 02:15:03.671
Lie.

02:15:04.571 --> 02:15:05.805
That is completely a lie.

02:15:08.238 --> 02:15:10.271
I do not know anything about the vial
or the poison.

02:15:13.671 --> 02:15:16.671
God will punish those who ambushed me!

02:15:18.871 --> 02:15:19.971
Do not worry.

02:15:20.805 --> 02:15:22.771
I will punish you with my own sword.

02:15:27.038 --> 02:15:28.838
Is there anyone else who has something
to say?

02:15:35.205 --> 02:15:36.205
Yes, there is.

02:15:37.805 --> 02:15:38.938
Go ahead, Gundogdu Bey.

02:15:43.238 --> 02:15:46.105
That night, when I came to question you...

02:15:47.205 --> 02:15:50.971
...you said that, there was another matter
needed to be solved, is that true?

02:15:52.238 --> 02:15:53.705
True, Bey. I said that.

02:15:56.205 --> 02:15:57.505
What are those matters?

02:15:59.771 --> 02:16:03.205
Before the court, these matters
should be investigated.

02:16:05.838 --> 02:16:10.905
That is why, I think that two more people
should be questioned as well.

02:16:12.238 --> 02:16:13.771
Who are these people, Gundogdu Bey?

02:16:19.205 --> 02:16:20.271
Selcan Hatun...

02:16:22.138 --> 02:16:23.505
...and Goncagul Hatun.

02:16:34.005 --> 02:16:36.771
Forgive me but Korkut Bey is gasping
his life out.

02:16:45.705 --> 02:16:46.705
Brother!

02:16:47.171 --> 02:16:48.171
Father.

02:16:51.105 --> 02:16:52.105
Father.

02:16:53.271 --> 02:16:54.271
Brother!

02:16:58.305 --> 02:17:01.571
No! Please do not do this, brother!
Do not leave us!

02:17:13.771 --> 02:17:15.138
My God, please help us!

02:17:41.005 --> 02:17:42.771
Father. Father. Father. Father.

02:17:43.538 --> 02:17:44.971
Father. Father.

02:17:45.605 --> 02:17:47.105
Father! Father!

02:17:48.605 --> 02:17:49.605
Father!

02:19:37.638 --> 02:19:38.638
Tugtekin!

02:19:39.805 --> 02:19:41.205
Tugtekin, my brother!
