00:00.000 --> 01:40.156
Episode 51 will start after 12:27 min.

12:27.340 --> 12:31.340
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:44.672 --> 12:46.072
Tugtekin!

12:47.272 --> 12:49.339
What's going on?
What is all this?

12:57.172 --> 13:01.039
What's going on here, cousin?

13:02.539 --> 13:04.639
Why did you capture
Bamsi and Turgut?

13:06.939 --> 13:12.172
Ertugrul's Alp, Dogan helped my
father's killer escape last night.

13:18.039 --> 13:19.672
The guards saw him.

13:20.639 --> 13:23.339
The sword of justice has no scabbard,
Tugtekin Bey.

13:23.906 --> 13:25.572
When she is found,
we'll do as needed.

13:28.672 --> 13:31.939
Turgut and Bamsi?
Why are they tied up?

13:32.172 --> 13:34.906
I ask the questions here,
Ertugrul Bey, not you.

13:35.072 --> 13:37.606
Only God can question me,
Tugtekin Bey.

13:40.572 --> 13:42.472
You should let them go
if you have no proof.

13:47.939 --> 13:53.506
And it is Mother Hayme's duty
to punish them if they are guilty.

13:54.639 --> 13:57.606
Ertugrul is right, Tugtekin Bey.

14:00.639 --> 14:06.039
Remember what happened the last time
you slandered my son and his Alps.

14:07.072 --> 14:11.072
Do not forget that these
brave men saved your life

14:11.206 --> 14:16.372
and brought you back to the tent
on their backs, alive and well.

14:18.606 --> 14:22.306
Abdurrahman!
Untie Bamsi and Turgut's hands.

14:30.206 --> 14:31.439
Tugtekin!

14:32.506 --> 14:37.206
Apparently Dogan committed a crime.
He will be punished for this.

14:38.339 --> 14:41.972
However, if you know anything else,
you should tell it to mother.

14:42.906 --> 14:45.139
If there is an account to be settled,
Mother Hayme will handle that.

14:45.639 --> 14:49.239
But it's not acceptable that you raid
a Kayi marquee like this.

14:55.939 --> 14:58.639
-Listen to me carefully, Mother Hayme.
-No!

14:59.472 --> 15:01.072
You listen to me carefully.

15:02.439 --> 15:07.306
If you have no proof,
let them untie my Alps.

15:09.106 --> 15:11.606
After then, I will invite you
to my marquee

15:12.306 --> 15:14.439
and listen to you carefully.

15:19.372 --> 15:21.306
That's all I have to say.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.206
Now, please come in.

15:41.239 --> 15:45.206
If you wish, I'll hear your
complaint as we share my breakfast.

15:45.572 --> 15:46.572
Mother Hayme.

15:49.272 --> 15:54.172
Dogan Alp must be found.
No matter what.

15:55.172 --> 15:59.606
Since you want to settle this,
I will find Dogan Alp and bring him.

16:01.606 --> 16:03.272
As for Ertugrul...

16:05.039 --> 16:10.039
I swear that if both Dogan Alp and
Banu Cicek are not punished,

16:10.406 --> 16:13.406
I will hold Ertugrul responsible
for everything.

16:19.272 --> 16:21.039
And this is all I have to say.

16:23.972 --> 16:26.506
Samsa. Prepare the Alps.

16:27.506 --> 16:30.706
You will get them dead or alive.

17:39.006 --> 17:40.106
Sir...

17:41.306 --> 17:43.239
...with your permission
we would like to set off now.

17:44.472 --> 17:46.106
You have my permission, son.

17:55.506 --> 17:57.206
Don't you despair.

17:59.406 --> 18:01.972
God tests his believers with challenges.

18:03.006 --> 18:07.106
There is brighter day
after every dark night, of course.

18:07.672 --> 18:10.639
We shall succeed
with the help of God.

18:13.606 --> 18:18.272
When Ertugrul Bey has an idea,
he will make it work eventually.

18:19.372 --> 18:20.906
I will pray for that.

18:23.306 --> 18:26.272
May God grant you
long life and glory.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.006
God be with you.

18:28.972 --> 18:30.106
God bless you.

18:58.572 --> 19:02.939
Do you realize what
Tugtekin's rage will lead to, son?

19:04.206 --> 19:06.572
His rage will eventually
guide him to the truth, mother.

19:07.372 --> 19:09.139
All we need to do is take
a firm stand for justice.

19:23.572 --> 19:27.339
Don't tell me you weren't in on this,
brother. What have you done?

19:28.172 --> 19:31.139
Brother Gundogdu, Ertugrul
has nothing to do with this.

19:31.472 --> 19:34.006
And you expect me to believe this,
is that so, Sungur?

19:34.672 --> 19:37.172
This nonsense will end
at the trial, you said.

19:37.239 --> 19:41.972
Why did you postpone it?
To get Dogan out, right?

19:43.339 --> 19:44.539
Gundogdu.

19:45.672 --> 19:49.972
It is clear that Dogan did this for a girl
that he loved and thought to be innocent.

19:50.439 --> 19:53.339
It's my duty to settle the score
with them when they are here.

19:53.972 --> 19:58.572
For love? Is that so, mother?
Is that all you have to say?

20:00.506 --> 20:03.172
Ertugrul has been digging our
graves for some time.

20:03.939 --> 20:07.672
Now, I wonder how he'll get us out
of these graves he dug himself?

20:34.939 --> 20:36.105
Tugtekin Bey.

20:37.006 --> 20:38.972
I won't let you get away
with this, Ertugrul.

20:40.105 --> 20:43.672
Even your mother who fell for your
tricks won't be able to save you.

20:44.706 --> 20:45.972
Gokce.

20:49.906 --> 20:53.272
<i>-Do I have permission, Bey?</i>
-Come in, Samsa, come.

20:56.306 --> 20:57.439
The Alps are ready, Bey.

20:59.106 --> 21:00.539
You stay at the nomad tent.

21:00.906 --> 21:03.639
Ertugrul and his Alps won't leave
the tent. Keep an eye on them!

21:04.506 --> 21:05.639
Understood, Bey.

21:16.206 --> 21:18.239
You shouldn't go after them, Bey.

21:18.706 --> 21:21.139
Leave it to Gundogdu,
the Alps' leader.

21:23.606 --> 21:26.106
You are the Bey of this tribe now.

21:26.572 --> 21:30.472
You should stay at your marquee
and make them to do as necessary.

21:30.706 --> 21:35.139
It would be especially unwise to leave
when Ertugrul is in the tent.

22:12.939 --> 22:14.339
I am ready, Ertugrul Bey.

22:16.539 --> 22:18.639
Wait to hear from me
in your tent, Selcan Hatun.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.406
Artuk Bey will send Goncagul
to Karakayalar somehow.

22:23.172 --> 22:25.539
You will make her see and follow you.

22:26.372 --> 22:28.472
Banu Cicek will be waiting
for you at Karakayalar.

22:28.672 --> 22:32.406
Goncagul must hear
everything you two say.

22:33.539 --> 22:36.972
She must hear that you'll meet
Banu Cicek before sunset tomorrow

22:37.439 --> 22:43.506
and that Banu will bring the evidence
to you. And she must believe it.

22:46.172 --> 22:48.439
She will then tell everything
to Aytolun Hatun.

22:50.406 --> 22:52.972
And Aytolun Hatun will go there
when you want her to.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.506
Do not worry, Bey.

22:55.072 --> 22:59.672
What if Goncagul can't persuade
Aytolun to go see Banu Cicek?

23:00.439 --> 23:02.006
What happens then, son?

23:04.339 --> 23:09.172
If she believes that Banu Cicek has the
evidence about those murders,

23:10.539 --> 23:11.939
she will go, mother.

23:14.139 --> 23:16.572
Ertugrul Bey, what if something
happens to Selcan?

23:21.139 --> 23:23.539
My brother, Sungur will be
with Selcan Hatun all along.

23:26.339 --> 23:27.539
Don't you worry.

23:42.006 --> 23:45.672
So, this was why he
postponed the trial.

23:46.639 --> 23:48.472
It was to help
Banu Cicek escape.

23:49.639 --> 23:51.572
I erred on the side of caution last night

23:51.639 --> 23:53.939
and had three Alps follow
Ertugrul's Alps.

23:54.406 --> 23:58.572
Turgut and Bamsi started a fight
in front of the tents out of the blue.

23:59.272 --> 24:04.072
Dogan helped Banu Cicek
escape during the commotion.

24:05.106 --> 24:09.006
I am certain that Ertugrul is also
involved in this, Tugtekin Bey.

24:10.472 --> 24:14.172
How else could it be, Gumustekin Bey?
Dogan couldn't have done this alone.

24:14.539 --> 24:17.039
However, he won't be alone
when he pays for this, either.

24:22.272 --> 24:23.972
Come in, Gundogdu Bey.

24:24.939 --> 24:26.672
Tugtekin Bey. Gumustekin Bey.

24:28.106 --> 24:30.572
I thought it'd be best if you go
after Banu Cicek and Dogan.

24:31.539 --> 24:33.639
That's a wise decision, Bey.

24:34.106 --> 24:37.539
You can rest assured that
I'll bring them to you soon.

24:37.939 --> 24:44.172
Thank you. But, show no mercy
if they reach for their swords.

24:45.672 --> 24:48.606
Do not worry, Bey.
We will do as necessary.

24:49.006 --> 24:51.539
Gumustekin Bey and I
are always on your side.

24:51.606 --> 24:52.672
Thank you.

24:53.439 --> 24:55.406
-With your permission.
-Of course.

25:26.939 --> 25:28.072
What is going on?

25:34.106 --> 25:36.239
We have to leave a sign
so that they can find us.

25:40.406 --> 25:41.706
Dogan Alp, wait.

25:50.939 --> 25:52.139
Here.

26:32.372 --> 26:33.506
Mother Hayme.

26:33.639 --> 26:37.939
Tugtekin Bey ordered Gundogdu Bey
to look for Dogan and Banu Cicek.

26:38.339 --> 26:41.472
Gundogdu Bey says that
he and the Alps will leave at once.

26:48.706 --> 26:52.706
Just like you thought, Gumustekin Bey
is teaching the rules to Tugtekin Bey.

26:53.272 --> 26:57.072
Brother Gundogdu will take Dogan
from where I want, when I want...

26:57.172 --> 26:59.939
and bring him safely to the nomad tent.

27:01.039 --> 27:03.072
-Let's go, brother.
-Let's go.

27:03.939 --> 27:05.372
Let's go and finish the job.

27:07.372 --> 27:08.572
Mother, with your permission.

27:10.039 --> 27:11.306
God be with you.

27:35.339 --> 27:36.572
Gundogdu Bey!

27:46.372 --> 27:48.006
Keep your eyes open, Bey.

27:49.439 --> 27:52.239
May God spare you from
the traps of traitors.

27:52.306 --> 27:53.406
Amen.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.572
-I hope you will find them and return.
-If God permits.

27:57.072 --> 28:00.572
Find them so that this betrayal
will no longer cause us suffering.

28:02.339 --> 28:04.606
Do not worry, Goncagul Hatun.

28:05.306 --> 28:07.572
Nobody can stop us from
being together again.

28:09.006 --> 28:10.906
You better start preparing
for the wedding.

28:11.339 --> 28:15.339
I'll marry you as soon as I return.
You should know.

28:18.172 --> 28:21.306
-Be safe.
-May God be with you, Bey.

28:36.146 --> 28:37.380
Mother Hayme.

28:39.046 --> 28:40.413
I want to have
a word with you.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.080
Come, have a seat.

28:47.580 --> 28:48.946
Tell me.

28:50.513 --> 28:55.113
Mother Hayme, Tugtekin Bey
lost his mind after what happened.

28:55.980 --> 28:57.513
He doesn't even listen to me.

28:59.013 --> 29:02.046
It's as if he's gone
deaf and blind.

29:05.046 --> 29:08.880
If we don't stop him,
there will be a lot of blood.

29:13.913 --> 29:18.213
Tugtekin is going through
very hard times.

29:19.246 --> 29:22.546
I'm afraid that things he will experience
in the future won't be easy either.

29:24.080 --> 29:28.346
As for you, you are
the wife of a Bey now.

29:29.646 --> 29:34.613
You are supposed to calm him down

29:35.480 --> 29:38.546
no matter how enraged
he may get at times.

29:39.380 --> 29:42.213
He will turn to
you to calm down.

29:44.313 --> 29:47.946
Don't forget what I just said
no matter what you go through.

29:49.180 --> 29:52.413
From now on, don't come to me
like a little girl

29:52.613 --> 29:55.046
every time you're in trouble.

29:57.413 --> 30:00.680
Stand up straight like
the wife of a Bey would.

30:11.146 --> 30:16.013
I know how to send Goncagul Hatun
to Karakayas, Bey. Don't worry.

30:17.580 --> 30:21.913
-Thank you, Artuk Bey.
-You set up a very good trap.

30:23.413 --> 30:25.513
I'm sure you
will be victorious.

30:25.646 --> 30:30.280
However, the real battle will begin
when the truth has been revealed.

30:30.913 --> 30:35.980
Exposing that jackal, Gumustekin
is the most important thing.

30:36.613 --> 30:39.313
God sets the best traps, Bey.

30:40.346 --> 30:42.880
He will get his share of God's traps, too.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.146
Gundogdu Bey is ready to leave,
Ertugrul Bey.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.346
They are watching our every move.

30:54.646 --> 30:55.646
All right.

30:58.146 --> 31:02.513
Now it is your turn, Artuk Bey.
It is time to lure the prey.

31:03.546 --> 31:05.046
Thank you, Bey.

31:41.313 --> 31:44.180
-Welcome, Bey.
-Thank you.

31:45.313 --> 31:46.680
Your horse is ready.

31:48.546 --> 31:50.113
I replaced the shoes.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.646
She's ready for a ride.

32:01.346 --> 32:03.246
Thank you, master, appreciated.

33:06.880 --> 33:10.080
You are doing much better,
Aytolun Hatun.

33:10.946 --> 33:14.513
However, I think there is still
some poison left in your body.

33:15.380 --> 33:20.513
It will cause internal damage
if you don't get rid of it all.

33:22.546 --> 33:26.413
What should I do, Artuk Bey?
Isn't there a cure?

33:26.546 --> 33:29.380
There is a way, Aytolun Hatun.
Don't worry.

33:30.180 --> 33:33.313
The cure is the thorny herb.

33:34.413 --> 33:39.380
However, it is a rare herb. It can be
found around here, in Karakayas.

33:41.113 --> 33:45.413
I would go collect some, but I have
so many patients waiting for me.

33:46.446 --> 33:48.080
I will go, Artuk Bey.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.946
I would do anything
to see my aunt healthy again.

33:51.946 --> 33:55.213
Goncagul Hatun, you go collect
and bring these herbs to me.

33:55.446 --> 33:57.113
I will take care of the rest.

34:00.346 --> 34:04.046
-With your permission.
-Permission is yours, Artuk Bey.

34:50.546 --> 34:52.146
I am going hunting, brother.

34:52.246 --> 34:54.646
Let's see what game I'll
come across in your tracks.

34:54.913 --> 34:58.413
-Good luck, brother.
-Godspeed, brother.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.980
Thank you.
Take care of yourself.

36:04.913 --> 36:10.313
They went this way.

36:11.446 --> 36:12.580
Come on, brothers.

36:53.913 --> 36:55.213
What is going on, Bamsi?

36:56.246 --> 36:58.180
I will go back to school.

37:00.446 --> 37:02.880
Education is important, brother.

37:06.146 --> 37:09.613
Do you think fighting heathens
with weapons is the only way?

37:11.346 --> 37:15.246
An ignorant Alp is much like
a warrior without a sword, brother.

37:16.646 --> 37:20.113
And yet, the war's only just begun.

37:21.646 --> 37:23.880
Thank you, brother.

37:24.546 --> 37:28.280
But, studying is nothing like
fighting a bear. Did you think it through?

37:28.880 --> 37:35.113
Brother, everybody will see what a
mighty Alp I am in this great battle.

37:36.646 --> 37:38.580
And Ertugrul Bey says...

37:38.680 --> 37:42.180
"If we become the sea,
all rivers will merge with us."

37:45.080 --> 37:48.113
Come on brother.
We shouldn't be late. Come on.

37:48.280 --> 37:49.980
Okay, okay. Wait.

37:52.046 --> 37:53.146
Let's go.

37:53.613 --> 37:55.613
May God be with you!

38:03.580 --> 38:05.046
They are still behind us.

38:05.646 --> 38:09.013
Do not worry, brother.
Nobody can harm the qualified.

38:09.346 --> 38:12.413
God will protect us.
God will protect us, brother.

38:57.446 --> 39:00.213
Why do you look like a reindeer
that stumbled upon a hunter?

39:00.946 --> 39:02.346
Are you looking for someone?

39:04.446 --> 39:05.946
We are not looking for anybody, Bey.

39:06.380 --> 39:08.546
We are just looking around like
Tugtekin Bey told us to.

39:10.380 --> 39:12.680
Fine, fine. You should.

39:15.080 --> 39:18.346
But stay alert. Sometimes,
the hunter ends up as the hunted.

39:20.113 --> 39:23.446
Our tribe always has a place
for brave Alps like you.

40:39.580 --> 40:41.013
God bless.

40:42.113 --> 40:43.346
Here you go brother.

41:36.013 --> 41:38.346
What is wrong, brother?
Why are you laughing?

41:38.646 --> 41:41.380
We're laughing at you, Bamsi Bey.
You couldn't read it.

41:53.946 --> 41:58.880
Come on dervishes,
let's listen to Bamsi Alp again.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.513
Go ahead, brother.

42:43.346 --> 42:44.680
Dervish brother...

42:46.580 --> 42:48.546
...couldn't I study
without having to read?

44:15.080 --> 44:17.180
-Turgut?
-Yes, father?

44:17.480 --> 44:18.546
Aykiz?

44:19.646 --> 44:22.013
I want a grandchild
as soon as possible.

44:22.580 --> 44:25.680
I want to hug and love her.

44:40.546 --> 44:42.413
Aykiz!

44:47.880 --> 44:49.446
I am out of words now, father.

44:50.546 --> 44:54.346
We will stand in the way of
those after slander and unrest.

44:55.013 --> 45:00.646
It's time to avenge those
who made these lands miserable for us.

45:50.946 --> 45:54.146
We are close.
They can't be far away.

46:38.080 --> 46:40.513
I can't bear to see you
like this, Cicek Hatun.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.513
I'm worried about you, Dogan.

46:46.880 --> 46:49.646
Don't worry about anything
when I am with you.

46:51.346 --> 46:52.413
I know.

46:54.413 --> 47:00.546
My only consolation in these hard times
is that you are here with me.

47:01.446 --> 47:06.580
I will always be with you. In bad times
as well as good times, I hope.

47:16.313 --> 47:17.580
Bey.

47:25.980 --> 47:29.013
Bey. I placed the signs
like you told me to.

47:29.146 --> 47:31.046
Gundogdu Bey and his
men will be here soon.

47:32.613 --> 47:34.446
You know what to do, Banu Cicek.

47:35.246 --> 47:37.180
Dogan Alp told me everything, Bey.

47:38.313 --> 47:40.546
Selcan Hatun will bring
Goncagul to Karakayas.

47:41.213 --> 47:42.413
You should be on your way too.

47:42.880 --> 47:48.913
It is your duty to make her believe
that the evidence is real.

47:49.980 --> 47:51.413
What if she doesn't believe us, Bey?

47:52.146 --> 47:53.946
They will believe because

47:54.113 --> 47:57.113
they are afraid of being
exposed for these murders.

47:58.446 --> 48:01.613
Aytolun messed up everything
when she failed to kill you.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.280
This is why she is angry.

48:03.446 --> 48:08.046
She won't be able to stand
seeing you and Selcan together.

48:09.146 --> 48:12.113
She expects to take
the evidence from you,

48:12.346 --> 48:15.580
kill you both,
and blame you for everything.

48:17.180 --> 48:19.013
You won't be alone in Karakayas.

48:19.180 --> 48:21.646
However, you must be alert.

48:23.113 --> 48:26.980
Bey, I'm worried about Dogan Alp.

48:28.246 --> 48:30.480
I am afraid of Tugtekin Bey's wrath

48:31.146 --> 48:33.680
when Gundogdu Bey catches him
and brings him to the tent, Bey.

48:34.046 --> 48:36.646
Aytolun will not come to Karakayas
when Dogan's with you.

48:37.046 --> 48:40.013
She must think that you
are alone to fall for our trap.

48:40.313 --> 48:42.413
This is why, we have to do this.

48:43.146 --> 48:44.480
Also, do not worry.

48:44.580 --> 48:49.480
Neither brother Gundogdu nor my mother
would let anything happen to Dogan.

48:51.146 --> 48:53.913
Bey is right, Cicek Hatun.
Do not worry about me.

48:54.213 --> 48:56.680
Go and expose the treason
within the nomad tent.

48:59.613 --> 49:01.046
Godspeed.

49:25.546 --> 49:28.480
Cover the prints of her horse.
Make sure she's not followed

49:28.580 --> 49:30.080
Of course, Bey.

49:33.080 --> 49:36.580
We are facing two brave men
like Gundogdu and Tugtekin Beys.

49:37.380 --> 49:38.880
It won't be easy.

49:40.346 --> 49:41.546
May God be with you.

50:47.380 --> 50:50.046
The marks are fresh, Bey.
They can't be far away.

50:51.613 --> 50:53.446
Good. We will split into three.

50:54.046 --> 50:56.113
You surround Kurtbogazi
from the left and right.

50:56.213 --> 50:57.446
Yes, Bey.

51:44.246 --> 51:47.380
-May I come in, Gumustekin Bey?
-Come in.

51:52.913 --> 51:55.080
I have a letter from
Ameer Sadettin Kobek.

52:00.046 --> 52:02.980
-Is he in Konya?
-No, Bey. He is at the caravansary.

52:38.046 --> 52:40.346
I know everything you do now.

52:41.513 --> 52:44.213
You won't be able to do as you please
around here from now on, Ertugrul.

52:46.180 --> 52:48.913
-Do I have permission, Bey?
-Come in.

52:56.013 --> 52:58.313
If you excuse me,
I have a request, Bey.

52:58.446 --> 52:59.680
Tell me, Samsa.

53:00.680 --> 53:03.946
We lost track of Ertugrul Bey.

53:10.313 --> 53:13.180
-What are you talking about, Samsa?
-We don't know what happened, Bey.

53:13.246 --> 53:15.646
He left the tent suddenly.
We went after him.

53:15.946 --> 53:18.680
However, suddenly he disappeared.

53:20.046 --> 53:23.013
We searched everywhere,
but couldn't find him, Bey.

53:23.680 --> 53:25.446
We ran into Sungurtekin Bey.

53:27.180 --> 53:29.213
How many times have you
been tricked by them now?

53:29.546 --> 53:32.013
Didn't I tell you to
stay alert?

53:34.080 --> 53:38.180
Are you an idiot, Samsa?
Are you an idiot?

53:40.113 --> 53:46.013
How could so many men can't keep
track of a single man? One man! One!!

53:47.146 --> 53:48.680
-Bey...
-Shut up.

53:50.013 --> 53:52.013
Shut up!

53:52.180 --> 53:54.980
Get out! Get out!

54:01.346 --> 54:03.513
What are you up to this time, Ertugrul?

54:13.980 --> 54:16.646
Do not leave
your man by himself, Gokce.

54:17.346 --> 54:21.013
Stay with him.
Calm him down.

54:36.046 --> 54:39.246
I have really important things
to tell you, Aytolun.

54:42.113 --> 54:43.480
Come.

54:55.880 --> 54:58.913
We are reaping the rewards
of our efforts today, Aytolun.

54:58.980 --> 55:01.446
Tell me brother.
I'm dying to know.

55:04.280 --> 55:08.480
I don't need to go to Konya anymore.
Tonight is the moment of truth.

55:09.313 --> 55:12.246
Ameer Sadettin is going to meet
with the Turkmen Beys...

55:13.580 --> 55:15.680
...and officially announce the margrave.

55:22.580 --> 55:26.246
Thank God, brother. Thank God.

55:27.280 --> 55:29.546
After every trouble comes a reward.

55:30.146 --> 55:36.180
Those we gave up, those we sacrificed,
the troubles we've been through...

55:37.580 --> 55:39.980
We are getting rewarded
for all these.

55:42.146 --> 55:44.013
Now is time for joy.

55:44.980 --> 55:46.280
The time has come, Aytolun.

55:47.613 --> 55:49.080
In fact it's overdue.

55:50.146 --> 55:51.413
Our troubles are over.

55:52.980 --> 55:56.013
Our future is as bright
as the sun in the sky.

55:58.280 --> 55:59.446
Where is Tugtekin?

56:00.646 --> 56:03.613
The Alps going after
Ertugrul lost track of him.

56:04.113 --> 56:05.413
He is very angry.

56:05.646 --> 56:07.180
They are with Gokce.

56:07.580 --> 56:09.913
I'll go and tell Tugtekin
about the meeting.

56:24.646 --> 56:26.646
Do I have permission, Bey?

56:28.213 --> 56:29.880
Come in, Gumustekin Bey.

56:38.246 --> 56:40.280
I have very important news for you.

56:42.113 --> 56:46.680
Bey, I'll go and see if
Mother needs anything.

56:52.980 --> 56:54.046
Go ahead, Gumustekin Bey.

56:55.946 --> 56:58.180
I received a letter
from Ameer Sadettin Kobek.

56:59.446 --> 57:02.046
He invited all the Turkmen Beys
to the Caravansary

57:02.180 --> 57:05.513
to discuss an important issue.

57:06.246 --> 57:07.946
What is the important issue?

57:08.246 --> 57:10.913
I have no idea.
I am curious, too.

57:11.946 --> 57:17.313
However, I know that this is my first
important duty as a Dodurga Bey.

57:18.980 --> 57:23.146
We need to show all Turkmen Beys,
especially Sadettin Kobek,

57:23.313 --> 57:25.913
that Dodurga is in safe hands.

57:27.146 --> 57:29.413
Thank you.
Then, we'll leave together.

57:30.046 --> 57:33.313
Forgive me, Tugtekin Bey.
I need to hit the road early.

57:33.513 --> 57:36.180
Ameer Sadettin is waiting
for me at the Caravansary.

57:37.013 --> 57:40.413
I will go to Caravansary right after
I tell Hayme Hatun.

57:41.380 --> 57:42.980
What's up, Gumustekin Bey?

57:44.446 --> 57:46.113
So far as I can tell,

57:47.180 --> 57:51.580
Ameer Sadettin Kobek wants to have a
chat with me at the palace.

57:54.613 --> 57:56.946
In that case,
I wish you a nice trip.

57:57.080 --> 57:58.180
Thank you, Bey.

58:00.213 --> 58:03.946
Bey, take care of my daughter
and my sister.

58:04.980 --> 58:06.980
You can trust me,
Gumustekin Bey.

58:07.946 --> 58:09.046
With your permission, Bey.

58:21.880 --> 58:25.146
After we heard that Tugtekin Bey
burst here like that in the morning,

58:25.280 --> 58:27.013
we no longer feel at ease,
Mother Hayme.

58:27.246 --> 58:29.646
When we think about
what happened previously,

58:29.980 --> 58:31.546
we're worried, Mother Hayme.

58:32.446 --> 58:35.180
Didn't Ertugrul Bey turn out
to be right, that time?

58:37.546 --> 58:41.980
Didn't he punish the traitors
and save the tribe from trouble?

58:42.680 --> 58:45.080
Didn't he clear his name
from that accusation?

58:45.480 --> 58:48.113
You are right, Mother Hayme.
You are right.

58:48.913 --> 58:51.946
However, we still do not feel at ease.

58:52.980 --> 58:56.380
What will happen if they can't find Banu
Cicek? Dogan is no ordinary Alp.

58:56.613 --> 58:59.213
He's Ertugrul Bey's aide.

58:59.480 --> 59:02.380
Ertugrul Bey will be
held accountable in the end.

59:03.080 --> 59:05.246
What is Ertugrul Bey trying to do,
Mother Hayme?

59:07.413 --> 59:11.280
We respect Ertugrul Bey,
just like we respect you.

59:12.013 --> 59:14.046
However, spring is upon us.

59:14.213 --> 59:16.646
What about our herds,
our nomad group?

59:16.880 --> 59:19.913
-He is right.
-What is going to happen then?

59:20.080 --> 59:22.380
Never mind tomorrow,
even today is uncertain.

59:24.213 --> 59:29.213
I will discuss this matter thoroughly
with Gundogdu Bey when he returns.

59:30.080 --> 59:32.180
We expect to hear good news
from you, Mother Hayme.

59:32.346 --> 59:35.146
-With your permission.
-Permission is yours.

59:58.313 --> 59:59.346
Mother Hayme!

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.313
Gumustekin Bey wants to see you.

01:00:06.013 --> 01:00:07.113
Send him in.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.446
Ameer Sadettin invited all
the Turkmen Beys to caravansary

01:00:45.579 --> 01:00:49.046
to discuss an important matter,
Hayme Hatun.

01:00:55.646 --> 01:00:58.346
If you have nothing to say,
and done with making me stand up

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.480
here like a servant,
I request your permission.

01:01:00.579 --> 01:01:02.646
I need to be at the caravansary.

01:01:03.313 --> 01:01:06.313
The Kayi will accept the invitation.

01:02:00.446 --> 01:02:02.346
They are headed for Kurtbogazi.

01:03:06.213 --> 01:03:08.246
You look like you're having fun, Dogan.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:05.913
Where is that killer?

01:05:06.013 --> 01:05:08.013
Banu Cicek didn't kill anyone, brother.

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.646
Where is she?

01:05:10.546 --> 01:05:12.446
She escaped the cruelty
of humans...

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.946
and took refuge in God's justice.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.680
Where is Gundogdu Bey?

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.946
Is he going to save you?

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.946
Banu Cicek is here!

01:07:08.946 --> 01:07:11.146
Did Ertugrul Bey have
anything to do with this?

01:07:11.646 --> 01:07:13.546
No, he didn't.

01:07:14.346 --> 01:07:17.880
I did what I did because
I love Banu Cicek.

01:07:52.509 --> 01:07:53.643
Banu Cicek!

01:07:55.343 --> 01:07:56.343
Stop!

01:09:03.343 --> 01:09:06.076
No victory that we did not pay
the price for is ours.

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:08.643
How happy is he who paid the price.

01:10:43.076 --> 01:10:47.043
This letter will be delivered
to the vizier of Georgia at once.

01:10:48.376 --> 01:10:50.043
Yes, his highness Ameer.

01:10:54.376 --> 01:10:56.943
So, Korkut Bey passed away

01:10:57.409 --> 01:11:00.143
and the new Bey is his son,
Tugtekin, you say?

01:11:00.509 --> 01:11:04.109
And my Sister Aytolun lives in
Tugtekin's marquee

01:11:04.243 --> 01:11:06.443
as she was entrusted to his father.

01:11:07.409 --> 01:11:10.243
It seems that you encircled
Tugtekin's marquee rather good.

01:11:12.576 --> 01:11:15.676
When you become the margrave, he will be
on your side then, that is good.

01:11:16.243 --> 01:11:18.309
And he also will do as I say.

01:11:21.609 --> 01:11:24.143
What if he becomes besotted with
the idea of becoming the margrave

01:11:24.276 --> 01:11:27.176
himself as well, like his father?
What if he rebels against you?

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:34.243
Then, I will behead him as I did
his father before, Ameer Sadettin.

01:11:35.276 --> 01:11:38.043
-Gundogdu?
-Gundogdu will marry my daughter.

01:11:40.243 --> 01:11:43.043
I have him on a tight leash as well,
Ameer Sadettin.

01:11:44.109 --> 01:11:45.976
He will not be going against my will.

01:11:47.309 --> 01:11:48.609
Well done, Gumustekin.

01:11:50.443 --> 01:11:52.743
You are fulfilling the promises
you gave me, one by one.

01:11:56.409 --> 01:12:00.476
I learned how to manage politics in
the palace from you, Ameer Sadettin.

01:12:02.176 --> 01:12:05.343
So, there is nothing left to discuss
with Beys tonight.

01:12:06.443 --> 01:12:08.176
Without delay

01:12:09.076 --> 01:12:12.576
I will inform the Beys that I want
to see you become the margrave.

01:12:16.943 --> 01:12:18.509
I believe you have no problems with it.

01:12:20.076 --> 01:12:21.709
None, Ameer Sadettin.

01:12:24.443 --> 01:12:26.176
Now go and take rest.

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:29.109
Tonight is your night.

01:12:41.943 --> 01:12:44.443
May God keep you from harm's way,
Ameer Sadettin.

01:15:03.676 --> 01:15:05.543
Where are you, Banu Cicek?

01:15:06.309 --> 01:15:08.109
You should have been here already.

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:16.476
What is it that you are after,
Selcan Hatun?

01:15:42.209 --> 01:15:44.743
God, why are these things happening to us?

01:15:45.043 --> 01:15:46.643
May God help us.

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:50.076
Banu Cicek! Sister, what happened to you?

01:15:52.743 --> 01:15:54.676
Come and lean on me.

01:15:59.276 --> 01:16:00.543
Come here.

01:16:02.476 --> 01:16:03.476
Wait.

01:16:13.976 --> 01:16:15.376
Are you alright?

01:16:16.743 --> 01:16:19.176
I came across with Gundogdu Bey's Alps.

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:21.543
Why are all these things happening to us?

01:16:21.676 --> 01:16:24.376
Help me to remove the arrow
from my shoulder.

01:16:24.609 --> 01:16:26.409
Alright, wait.

01:16:26.976 --> 01:16:29.743
Selcan Hatun. Draw the arrow at once.

01:16:30.376 --> 01:16:33.976
Do not hold back thinking that
it will hurt. At once!

01:16:37.309 --> 01:16:39.209
Hang on. Do not worry.

01:16:41.509 --> 01:16:43.576
Hang on, my sister.

01:16:45.743 --> 01:16:47.109
With the name of God.

01:17:15.009 --> 01:17:16.509
Did Goncagul come?

01:17:17.643 --> 01:17:19.009
She did.

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:30.276
Aytolun will not be able to evade us
this time, Selcan Hatun.

01:17:33.343 --> 01:17:36.343
I have found the evidence related
to the death of Duru Hatun.

01:17:40.143 --> 01:17:43.009
This time, the one hanging
in the middle of the nomad tent

01:17:44.143 --> 01:17:46.076
will not be me, I will be
the one hanging them.

01:17:54.543 --> 01:17:56.509
I will be here before sundown tomorrow.

01:17:57.043 --> 01:17:59.009
I will bring you the evidence
that I have found.

01:18:02.143 --> 01:18:06.743
That evidence will bring the end of
the snake named Aytolun in court.

01:18:10.143 --> 01:18:11.443
Do not worry about me.

01:18:13.709 --> 01:18:15.743
Do not tell a word of this to anyone.

01:18:18.643 --> 01:18:21.209
I do not trust anyone but you
in the nomad tent.

01:18:22.243 --> 01:18:23.443
May God help you.

01:18:27.043 --> 01:18:28.076
Thank you.

01:18:30.743 --> 01:18:31.743
Come.

01:19:02.143 --> 01:19:05.309
-May God help you.
-And you, sister.

01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:19.576
Like a bird in a trap.

01:20:20.443 --> 01:20:24.276
As they struggle, they will lose
their wings, then their claws

01:20:24.443 --> 01:20:28.676
and finally their necks
to the sword of justice.

01:20:55.576 --> 01:20:59.043
The Sheikh of Ahis Kirmani would like
to see you, his highness Ameer.

01:21:06.076 --> 01:21:07.109
Let him in.

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:22.509
Peace be upon you.

01:21:23.976 --> 01:21:25.143
And peace be upon you.

01:21:29.443 --> 01:21:32.009
I was not expecting to see you,
Sheikh Kirmani.

01:21:35.343 --> 01:21:38.209
I would like you to know that
we always pray for your well being.

01:21:39.443 --> 01:21:40.676
How happy I am.

01:21:41.409 --> 01:21:42.543
Be seated.

01:21:55.176 --> 01:21:58.309
We always pray for our enemies

01:21:59.143 --> 01:22:01.709
as well as our friends, Ameer Sadettin.

01:22:02.643 --> 01:22:06.443
I have never heard of one to pray
for his enemies, Sheikh Kirmani.

01:22:07.576 --> 01:22:10.176
We say, "my Creator, show compassion

01:22:10.409 --> 01:22:13.443
to those who are evil,
who creates mischiefs

01:22:13.576 --> 01:22:15.976
who rebels and who lives as bandits."

01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:18.409
Why would you do that?

01:22:19.743 --> 01:22:23.976
The art is to see the goods that
come from those who are evil.

01:22:25.143 --> 01:22:27.076
They torture us so much that ultimately

01:22:27.176 --> 01:22:30.943
they save us from evil
and carry us to goodness.

01:22:32.343 --> 01:22:38.743
We mainly pray for those who phonate
the young and kill them without mercy.

01:22:40.509 --> 01:22:45.042
Because they teach us to be cautious
and give us the will to fight.

01:22:49.009 --> 01:22:52.143
I came here to cognate
the Newroz with Kayis.

01:22:52.376 --> 01:22:54.276
This also presented me the opportunity
to come and see you.

01:22:55.943 --> 01:22:57.176
Kayis you say?

01:22:57.276 --> 01:23:00.209
We came here with our prayers to see
Ertugrul Bey who taught the cruels

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.609
who wanted to slaughter us, their place.

01:23:03.443 --> 01:23:06.076
So, he is the one who saved you
from the attack you suffered?

01:23:06.609 --> 01:23:09.543
Thank God who brings out the good
within every evil.

01:23:53.709 --> 01:23:56.309
-Goncagul?
-Aunt.

01:23:58.609 --> 01:24:01.576
I saw Selcan and Banu Cicek met, aunt.

01:24:02.309 --> 01:24:04.709
What are you saying?
How can this be?

01:24:06.243 --> 01:24:10.943
I was out collecting herbs, I saw Selcan
then I became suspicious.

01:24:11.376 --> 01:24:14.543
I secretly followed her until
she reached Karakayas.

01:24:15.443 --> 01:24:17.176
Then Banu Cicek showed up.

01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:19.743
-She was hurt.
-Hurt?

01:24:21.009 --> 01:24:24.409
Alps have found her and
shot her with an arrow.

01:24:26.976 --> 01:24:29.709
I heard them talking, aunt.

01:24:39.943 --> 01:24:42.309
Alright. What did they talk about?

01:24:44.443 --> 01:24:48.543
It seems that they have evidence
related to Duru Hatun's death, aunt.

01:24:49.743 --> 01:24:51.209
It is impossible.

01:24:52.509 --> 01:24:55.309
They will meet again at the same spot
tomorrow before sundown.

01:24:55.576 --> 01:24:58.343
Banu Cicek will bring the evidence
to Selcan.

01:24:59.176 --> 01:25:02.676
Then everything will be
revealed in court, aunt.

01:25:03.576 --> 01:25:06.643
What are we going to do after that?
What are we going to do, aunt?

01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:08.343
Wait, stop there.

01:25:09.209 --> 01:25:10.543
You confused me.

01:25:13.143 --> 01:25:15.576
I can send the Alps and kill them both.

01:25:16.409 --> 01:25:19.409
What about the evidence?
What if the Alps take it?

01:25:20.176 --> 01:25:21.576
Then, what are we going to do?

01:25:24.243 --> 01:25:25.343
Then...

01:25:32.476 --> 01:25:34.143
I will go and get it myself.

01:25:35.209 --> 01:25:37.109
You said that Banu Cicek is hurt.

01:25:37.376 --> 01:25:39.676
Dealing with both of them will be easy.

01:25:40.543 --> 01:25:42.709
Then we all can have a sigh of relief.

01:25:43.443 --> 01:25:45.409
And Selcan will be regarded as a murderer.

01:25:46.743 --> 01:25:49.709
What about Dogan?
What if he comes as well?

01:25:51.076 --> 01:25:52.643
How can you deal with him, Aunt?

01:26:18.976 --> 01:26:20.109
<i>Aytolun Hatun.</i>

01:26:20.743 --> 01:26:21.976
Come in, Kaya.

01:26:26.376 --> 01:26:28.976
Gundogdu Bey caught Dogan Alp
and brought him here.

01:26:42.409 --> 01:26:48.176
It seems that those two women's death
will come by my sword.

01:27:27.643 --> 01:27:29.176
Where is Banu Cicek, Bey?

01:27:29.376 --> 01:27:33.576
We could not catch her. However,
our Alps are after her with Nurul.

01:27:40.576 --> 01:27:42.409
Why did you help Banu Cicek escape?

01:27:44.543 --> 01:27:46.309
Did Ertugrul Bey order you to do so?

01:27:46.976 --> 01:27:49.143
I did what I did for my love,
Tugtekin Bey.

01:27:50.009 --> 01:27:52.709
But, if I believed that Banu Cicek
was a murderer

01:27:53.043 --> 01:27:56.409
I would bury my love to my heart
and bring her to you.

01:28:10.209 --> 01:28:11.643
We have found Banu Cicek, Bey.

01:28:12.143 --> 01:28:14.143
She managed to escape but
I shot her with an arrow.

01:28:14.376 --> 01:28:16.076
-Banu Cicek!
-She cannot get far.

01:28:16.409 --> 01:28:18.209
No! Banu Cicek!

01:28:18.376 --> 01:28:21.376
Send more Alps after her. Do not come back
here unless you find her body.

01:28:23.509 --> 01:28:25.343
What heartless men you are!

01:28:25.943 --> 01:28:27.543
I am telling you that
Banu Cicek is innocent!

01:28:28.409 --> 01:28:33.109
Since Dogan Alp admitted to his crime,
let Mother Hayme decide his punishment.

01:28:33.943 --> 01:28:37.209
Since she wanted that, I need
to show respect to her wish.

01:28:42.376 --> 01:28:45.143
However, do not send him
to the caged tent, Bey.

01:28:46.243 --> 01:28:50.709
Tie him up to a pole around here. And
have Dodurga Alps to keep watch by him.

01:28:52.243 --> 01:28:54.009
No one gets close to him.

01:28:54.343 --> 01:28:56.976
After we return from
Ameer Sadettin's feast

01:28:58.043 --> 01:28:59.976
I would like to see
Mother Hayme's justness.

01:29:00.676 --> 01:29:02.109
What invitation is this?

01:29:02.443 --> 01:29:06.376
His highness Ameer, invited all the Bey's
from neighboring nomad tents.

01:29:16.076 --> 01:29:19.576
So Dogan, what is going to happen now?
Is it better like this?

01:29:20.476 --> 01:29:22.476
I am telling you that
Cicek Hatun is innocent!

01:29:23.309 --> 01:29:26.409
You made a pure hearted woman
fall prey to the wolves!

01:29:31.976 --> 01:29:33.509
Take him away and tie him.

01:30:49.976 --> 01:30:51.276
What is the current situation,
Selcan Hatun?

01:30:51.376 --> 01:30:53.943
Goncagul believed what she heard,
Ertugrul Bey.

01:30:54.409 --> 01:30:57.676
Indeed, it was obvious that she was
so scared from the way she ran away.

01:30:58.643 --> 01:31:00.043
Obviously, she believed them.

01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:04.076
But there is one more problem, brother.

01:31:05.243 --> 01:31:08.009
Banu Cicek was hurt when she arrived,
Ertugrul Bey.

01:31:08.576 --> 01:31:10.509
I removed the arrow from her shoulder.

01:31:10.609 --> 01:31:13.076
She said that she will take care of
the wound herself and then she left.

01:31:13.243 --> 01:31:15.543
She told me that she will
come to Karakayas

01:31:15.676 --> 01:31:17.609
before sundown tomorrow,
just like you said.

01:31:19.143 --> 01:31:22.676
I heard that Ameer Sadettin invited all
the Bey's from neighboring nomad tents

01:31:23.009 --> 01:31:24.743
...to Kervansaray tonight.

01:31:27.143 --> 01:31:29.643
So, Banu Cicek is hurt.

01:31:30.676 --> 01:31:34.176
And there is a feast tonight.
Tugtekin will be in Caravansary as well.

01:31:35.243 --> 01:31:37.109
We cannot be sure what
we might be up against.

01:31:39.076 --> 01:31:40.709
Seems we are running off
the rail, brother.

01:31:41.409 --> 01:31:46.376
They killed Korkut Bey. Then without
delay Kobek is on the move.

01:31:48.643 --> 01:31:50.476
I will find out their
real intentions tonight.

01:31:51.443 --> 01:31:53.076
What are their intentions, son?

01:31:53.576 --> 01:31:57.276
They do not only wish to rule the Turkmen
nomad tents as they please, mother.

01:31:59.743 --> 01:32:01.243
Their real intention is...

01:32:07.543 --> 01:32:10.743
Dogan has been caught.
Banu Cicek has been shot.

01:32:11.676 --> 01:32:16.109
Tell me, brother. How many more will
fall victim to these graves you dug?

01:32:16.376 --> 01:32:19.443
When will you open your eyes
and see the truth, brother?

01:32:19.943 --> 01:32:23.943
Enough, Ertugrul. I am fed up
with your meaningless nonsense.

01:32:24.009 --> 01:32:25.076
Enough!

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:29.376
Enough, already!

01:32:32.976 --> 01:32:35.443
When will you two brothers get along?

01:32:43.376 --> 01:32:45.076
I will give you two a task.

01:32:46.476 --> 01:32:48.276
Maybe this time, you two can get along!

01:32:51.943 --> 01:32:56.643
I would like you two to go
Ameer Sadettin's feast as substitutes.

01:32:59.543 --> 01:33:04.209
Mother! Do you not know what Ertugrul
thinks about Sadettin Kobek?

01:33:04.543 --> 01:33:06.376
How can you assign him
as a substitute as well?

01:33:08.309 --> 01:33:12.709
Seems that Ameer Sadettin would like
to talk about some crucial matter.

01:33:13.376 --> 01:33:15.609
If he asks something from you

01:33:16.076 --> 01:33:20.209
you should not agree to anything
that you do not approve.

01:33:21.576 --> 01:33:26.243
If one of you says no to a matter,
the other will adapt to it.

01:33:29.276 --> 01:33:30.676
Understood?

01:33:37.576 --> 01:33:38.976
Go, then.

01:33:50.276 --> 01:33:51.976
Banu Cicek is a courageous woman.

01:33:52.309 --> 01:33:54.176
She will get to Karakayas on time.

01:33:54.409 --> 01:33:57.276
No giving up, no surrender.

01:33:58.276 --> 01:33:59.576
You all know what to do.

01:34:01.976 --> 01:34:03.943
Tomorrow, the truth will be revealed.

01:34:38.509 --> 01:34:40.276
Where is Banu Cicek?

01:35:08.743 --> 01:35:10.109
Tugtekin.

01:35:11.576 --> 01:35:13.376
I know Dogan Alp well.

01:35:14.243 --> 01:35:18.243
Even if you do all that you can,
you cannot get a word out of him.

01:35:19.576 --> 01:35:22.643
Also, did you not say that Mother Hayme
will settle his punishment?

01:35:27.643 --> 01:35:29.276
Enough.

01:35:30.076 --> 01:35:31.443
This is enough for today.

01:35:34.976 --> 01:35:37.143
We will see what Mother Hayme will do.

01:35:41.509 --> 01:35:42.676
Tugtekin Bey!

01:35:44.643 --> 01:35:48.476
Since when beating an Alp who is tied,
brings honor to a Bey?

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:52.143
When did it become suitable for you
to advise Beys, Ertugrul Bey?

01:35:56.043 --> 01:36:00.309
Until the truth reveals itself,
stay away from my Alp.

01:36:08.543 --> 01:36:10.176
Keep your anger in check.

01:36:11.309 --> 01:36:15.109
At least until we come back from
Ameer Sadettin Kobek's feast.

01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:19.109
Is Mother Hayme
not coming to Caravansary?

01:36:19.443 --> 01:36:23.076
No. She assigned us both as substitutes.
We will come.

01:36:25.376 --> 01:36:27.409
This is also your doing,
is it not Ertugrul?

01:36:28.509 --> 01:36:29.509
You cannot settle with just us

01:36:29.576 --> 01:36:31.476
you have to go out and disturb
Turkmen Beys as well.

01:36:34.676 --> 01:36:39.276
To find the truth, I will disturb
whole world if necessary.

01:37:42.643 --> 01:37:43.643
Come here, boy.

01:39:20.376 --> 01:39:22.543
Ertugrul Bey from Kayi tribe is also here.

01:39:31.643 --> 01:39:34.109
There is a crucial matter, indeed.

01:39:34.943 --> 01:39:36.709
Has Gumustekin Bey said anything to you?

01:39:37.143 --> 01:39:40.176
His highness Ameer would like
to discuss a matter with us.

01:39:40.343 --> 01:39:41.709
That is all I know.

01:39:43.476 --> 01:39:45.376
-Hope for the best then.
-Hope for the best.

01:39:48.276 --> 01:39:51.943
Do you think that a good word would
come out both of their mouths, brother?

01:39:53.343 --> 01:39:56.576
Ertugrul. Please, brother, do not.

01:39:56.976 --> 01:39:59.376
Do not forget that we are here
as substitutes for our mother.

01:40:00.376 --> 01:40:02.142
Do not worry, I will not.

01:40:03.476 --> 01:40:06.309
I will stand against anything that
stands opposed to my nomad group.

01:40:07.009 --> 01:40:08.243
Ertugrul.

01:40:13.543 --> 01:40:15.509
His highness, Ameer Sadettin Kobek!

01:40:35.743 --> 01:40:39.709
It is an honour,
great Beys of Turkmen tribes.

01:40:41.443 --> 01:40:45.409
It brings me joy to see you all here.

01:40:48.009 --> 01:40:51.376
I see almost all of the neighboring
Turkmen Beys are here.

01:40:54.276 --> 01:40:57.009
Seeing our precious Tugtekin
and Gundogdu Bey

01:40:57.076 --> 01:41:01.276
who raided degenerate Noyan's place
and smashed it, among us

01:41:01.443 --> 01:41:03.543
brings me so much happiness.

01:41:06.109 --> 01:41:10.576
Also, I cannot stop myself from
mentioning Ertugrul Bey

01:41:11.609 --> 01:41:18.176
who with his courage and boldness won
many wars and kept our heads high.

01:41:25.009 --> 01:41:30.343
I would like to show my appreciation
to him again, in your presence.

01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:32.076
So do we, Bey.

01:41:34.009 --> 01:41:36.343
-You are welcome, as well.
-Thank you.

01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:38.109
Thank you.

01:42:23.943 --> 01:42:27.643
Please, honor me by sharing all these
blessings on my table with me.

01:42:30.443 --> 01:42:32.276
With the name of God.

01:42:33.143 --> 01:42:34.476
Go ahead, enjoy.

01:43:50.676 --> 01:43:54.443
It is not good that Hayme Hatun
sent Ertugrul here, Ameer Sadettin.

01:43:57.476 --> 01:43:59.176
Is Gundogdu not your son in law?

01:44:01.443 --> 01:44:03.076
Do not worry.

01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:17.743
Mother Hayme? Turgut and Bamsi are here.
They would like to see you.

01:44:23.443 --> 01:44:24.443
Send them in.

01:44:25.409 --> 01:44:26.443
As you wish, mother.

01:44:45.576 --> 01:44:46.576
What is it?

01:44:47.443 --> 01:44:49.209
Mother Hayme, it's Dogan.

01:44:50.443 --> 01:44:52.176
He learned that Banu Cicek is hurt.

01:44:53.076 --> 01:44:57.376
But we were not able to go and tell him
that she is well and healthy.

01:44:58.943 --> 01:45:01.609
The Alps of Tugtekin Bey, do not
let us near him, Mother Hayme.

01:45:03.043 --> 01:45:07.409
Even if he stands out there ashamed,
hungry and thirsty in the cold

01:45:07.676 --> 01:45:11.076
the situation will not affect him,
Mother Hayme.

01:45:12.009 --> 01:45:14.576
However, he is worried about
his beloved, Mother Hayme.

01:45:15.743 --> 01:45:18.076
Only you can help him
with his pain, Mother.

01:45:19.276 --> 01:45:22.976
If you let us, we would like to ask you
to go and tell Dogan

01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:25.043
that Banu Cicek is alright.

01:45:26.009 --> 01:45:28.176
Otherwise he will be miserable
all night, Mother Hayme.

01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:32.243
If there is anything to do,
you can do it, Mother Hayme.

01:45:47.643 --> 01:45:50.709
We are thankful to you for not only
inviting us to this grand feast

01:45:51.043 --> 01:45:52.509
that suits your high rank

01:45:52.643 --> 01:45:57.343
but also wanting to discuss a crucial
matter with us, Ameer Sadettin.

01:45:59.009 --> 01:46:03.976
You honored us by inviting all nomad tent
Beys who did not fret

01:46:04.076 --> 01:46:06.376
from going against Mongols for our State.

01:46:06.509 --> 01:46:11.376
First of all, I wish God's grace upon
your deceased father, Tugtekin Bey.

01:46:11.676 --> 01:46:12.676
Thank you.

01:46:13.309 --> 01:46:15.443
We share your pain.

01:46:15.943 --> 01:46:18.609
-My condolences.
-My condolences.

01:46:19.043 --> 01:46:22.676
-May God bestow mercy upon him.
-May God bestow mercy upon him.

01:46:23.043 --> 01:46:24.543
My condolences.

01:46:24.676 --> 01:46:27.943
Thank you. May God give you all
longevity. Thank you.

01:46:29.009 --> 01:46:33.009
I understand that you want to know
the crucial matter I want to discuss.

01:46:40.243 --> 01:46:43.043
Then let us talk without delay.

01:46:48.509 --> 01:46:51.443
To reinstate the order of our state...

01:46:52.443 --> 01:46:57.576
...and to make Turkmen tribes
more prosperous and powerful...

01:46:59.976 --> 01:47:02.076
...I would like to form
a new margrave seigniory.

01:47:05.176 --> 01:47:07.176
A new margrave seigniory?

01:47:08.376 --> 01:47:09.709
How can it be?

01:47:14.143 --> 01:47:19.309
And on this occasion, to a worthy Bey,
who you all know very well...

01:47:22.409 --> 01:47:23.976
...to Gumustekin Bey...

01:47:26.076 --> 01:47:28.609
...I would like to issue
this difficult assignment.

01:48:07.373 --> 01:48:08.473
Mother Hayme.

01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:10.507
Stay out of my way.

01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:12.773
Tugtekin Bey commanded no one
to approach him, Mother Hayme.

01:48:29.107 --> 01:48:31.840
Mother, they shot Banu Cicek.

01:48:33.907 --> 01:48:35.240
Patience, Dogan.

01:48:36.373 --> 01:48:40.240
Who knows what will happen to any of us.
God is almighty.

01:48:45.473 --> 01:48:47.473
And who knows

01:48:49.707 --> 01:48:52.473
maybe she has found somebody to
heal her wound.

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:07.740
If God permits, mother.

01:49:09.173 --> 01:49:10.540
May God bless you.

01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:15.307
Ertugrul Bey put up with many things
for Halime Sultan.

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:21.407
I see it better now.
It is all worth for the sake of love.

01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:28.507
Tomorrow is another day, Dogan Alp.

01:49:46.273 --> 01:49:47.473
<i>Thank God.</i>

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:00.607
The most beautiful example of unity

01:50:00.807 --> 01:50:03.573
and peace is in front of us,
Ameer Sadettin.

01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:08.773
Kayi tribe and Dodurga tribe were
forces to be reckoned with

01:50:09.473 --> 01:50:11.240
but now they are stronger than ever.

01:50:11.607 --> 01:50:12.840
He is right.

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.240
-Avshar Bey is right.
-True.

01:50:19.907 --> 01:50:24.840
The words of Avshar Bey Omer
confirmed my actions.

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.473
Thank you, thank you very much.

01:50:31.173 --> 01:50:32.807
Without a doubt, for this important duty

01:50:34.473 --> 01:50:40.173
Gumustekin Bey is the right choice.
He has always lent his support

01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:42.473
from Konya in our times of need.

01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:48.173
It gives me great honor that he is
a Bey of my nomad group.

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.440
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey. Thank you.

01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:55.907
With your permission, Ameer Sadettin.

01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.473
Go ahead, Ertugrul Bey.

01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:11.773
We are representing the Kayi tribe
in Mother Hayme's stead.

01:51:13.307 --> 01:51:17.107
My mother bestowed me and Gundogdu Bey
with this duty.

01:51:20.207 --> 01:51:22.773
Gumustekin Bey told Mother Hayme that

01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:27.373
you wanted to discuss
an important matter with us.

01:51:28.173 --> 01:51:29.173
It is true.

01:51:29.873 --> 01:51:34.573
But I fail to see any connection between
your intentions

01:51:34.807 --> 01:51:36.573
and what is actually happening in here.

01:51:42.607 --> 01:51:48.440
You are not here to discuss anything
other than giving us your commands.

01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:52.473
-What are you saying, Ertugrul Bey?
-Do you hear what you are saying?

01:51:53.407 --> 01:51:57.207
-What do you mean his commands?
-What are you saying, Ertugrul Bey?

01:51:58.207 --> 01:52:03.240
Brave Ertugrul, were you offended by us?
What makes you say such things?

01:52:06.907 --> 01:52:08.807
What you are doing here is as wrong as

01:52:10.273 --> 01:52:14.307
Noyan being taken away
from my brother Gundogdu's hands

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.273
while he was being executed,
Ameer Sadettin.

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:25.173
And some Turkmen Beys are not here

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:28.407
while we are talking about
important matters as this.

01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.673
He is right.

01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:34.640
-Other Turkmen Beys should be here.
-He is right.

01:52:34.807 --> 01:52:38.207
Our rights and wrongs define us,
Ertugtul Bey.

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:43.773
I hope almighty God does not shame us
with our decisions.

01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:45.673
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:50.307
It is my duty to prevent us from

01:52:53.107 --> 01:52:58.573
making a decision
that may shame us one day.

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:02.207
Yes, he is right.

01:53:02.607 --> 01:53:06.607
Other Beys should be here
if we are going to make a decision.

01:53:07.607 --> 01:53:10.173
Your insolence is wearing our patience,
Ertugrul Bey.

01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:14.173
When I heared the words of this
forthcoming brave man

01:53:16.207 --> 01:53:19.140
my confidence in Turkmen tribes
strengthened.

01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:22.307
On the contrary

01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:27.573
we will always value the objections
of Ertugrul Bey.

01:53:28.673 --> 01:53:33.773
Thus we can correct our mistakes.

01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:41.373
What do you think, Gundogdu Bey?

01:53:49.373 --> 01:53:50.607
His highness Ameer.

01:53:51.707 --> 01:53:58.440
I am sure that you intend to make the best
decision for our unity and peace.

01:54:01.673 --> 01:54:03.873
But Mother Hayme

01:54:04.707 --> 01:54:10.307
put Ertugrul Bey and me
in charge under one condition.

01:54:11.473 --> 01:54:18.140
Kayi tribe will not accept any decision
that we both do not approve.

01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.540
I do not have anything else
to say for now.

01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:28.540
Thank you, Gundogdu Bey.

01:54:29.607 --> 01:54:31.673
Your good intentions are enough for us.

01:54:35.207 --> 01:54:40.207
So I want to hear the final say of
Kayi tribe from Mother Hayme's mouth.

01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:46.273
If God permits, I will visit your
nomad tent as soon as possible.

01:54:46.573 --> 01:54:48.373
We would be honored. We will be waiting.

01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:52.307
So this margrave may bring us all
good fortune.

01:54:53.673 --> 01:54:54.840
Gumustekin Bey.

01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:58.507
We know that you are in God's side
and we trust you.

01:54:59.407 --> 01:55:00.707
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey.

01:55:01.207 --> 01:55:03.840
-Let's hope for the best.
-May it bring us good fortune.

01:55:04.307 --> 01:55:06.507
-Thank you.
-May the God be with you, always.

01:55:08.307 --> 01:55:09.307
Thank you.

01:55:34.273 --> 01:55:36.140
Your weapons can protect us
from our enemies

01:55:36.673 --> 01:55:39.273
but how can we protect ourselves
from all this treachery, Bey?

01:55:43.873 --> 01:55:46.873
We do not know what to believe
and who to trust anymore, Ertugrul Bey.

01:55:48.307 --> 01:55:50.740
Things need to get worse
before they get better, my gazelle.

01:55:52.107 --> 01:55:55.840
In the end, the truth will prevail
among all this treachery.

01:55:58.573 --> 01:56:00.173
The only thing you need to do is

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.840
becoming aware of the happiness
that grows inside you.

01:56:06.307 --> 01:56:07.407
Time is near.

01:56:08.373 --> 01:56:12.573
After our baby is born, our marquee
will be blessed with fortune.

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:18.873
Bless the day that you tracked
that gazelle and found me.

01:56:20.773 --> 01:56:22.773
I will be by your side
until my dying breath.

01:56:35.807 --> 01:56:39.240
So their aim was to make
Gumustekin the margrave.

01:56:41.107 --> 01:56:42.907
They will put a collar
on the Turkmen tribe

01:56:43.407 --> 01:56:45.840
and put Gumustekin in charge
like a guard dog, mother.

01:56:48.107 --> 01:56:50.140
Gumustekin is still in caravansary.

01:56:51.107 --> 01:56:53.640
They are making decisions about all of us.

01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:57.407
I will not allow this, brother.

01:56:58.173 --> 01:57:00.873
I will reveal their trap, do not worry.
-What will you do, son?

01:57:01.907 --> 01:57:04.207
I will take Gundogdu and Tugtekin
to Karakayalar.

01:57:05.173 --> 01:57:07.107
They will see the truth for themselves.

01:57:26.673 --> 01:57:28.907
You became the Bey of Dodurga nomad group

01:57:29.873 --> 01:57:32.507
and my brother was selected
as the margrave.

01:57:33.207 --> 01:57:36.807
Dodurga tribe will be exalted among
Turkmens.

01:57:39.473 --> 01:57:41.373
Glory belongs to our nomad group.

01:57:44.273 --> 01:57:46.873
None can stand in front of our future.

01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:50.173
You are right, mother.

01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:54.240
Our days of suffering are behind us.

01:57:55.573 --> 01:57:57.207
A bright future awaits our tribe.

01:57:59.807 --> 01:58:02.373
From now on, everything should be
worthy of our nomad group.

01:58:03.907 --> 01:58:07.507
It is time to say new words
and do new things.

01:58:08.573 --> 01:58:10.240
Nothing will be the same.

01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:11.873
Goncagul Hatun.

01:58:12.573 --> 01:58:16.373
Bring order to the weavery before spring.
Arrange everything.

01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:19.873
I will take care of the bazaar myself.

01:58:20.273 --> 01:58:22.140
As you command, Tugtekin Bey.

01:58:34.473 --> 01:58:39.240
Then I should finish what I have started.

01:58:53.207 --> 01:58:56.873
Aunt, I can not let you go there alone.

01:59:00.607 --> 01:59:03.340
I do not want you to to be a part of this,
Goncagul.

01:59:05.507 --> 01:59:06.840
Banu Cicek is wounded.

01:59:07.873 --> 01:59:10.873
Your aunt can take care of both of them.

01:59:12.607 --> 01:59:13.873
Do not worry.

02:00:38.907 --> 02:00:40.173
Brother.

02:00:50.873 --> 02:00:53.473
I have things to say to you.
We need to talk.

02:00:54.473 --> 02:00:57.240
What is happening, brother?
What are you up to again?

02:00:58.340 --> 02:00:59.640
Let us go to marquee.

02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:02.340
We cannot talk in here.

02:01:07.407 --> 02:01:08.707
You go on, Alps.

02:01:26.107 --> 02:01:29.773
Gundogdu Bey, Amer Sadettin Kobek
is waiting for you in caravansary.

02:01:30.173 --> 02:01:32.473
Thank you. I am coming.

02:01:37.673 --> 02:01:40.873
I need to go as soon as possible, brother.
We can talk later.

02:02:32.573 --> 02:02:35.573
So he left the destiny of other
Turkmen Beys to Gumustekin.

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:39.507
I cannot believe the things he has done
to bewitch Gundogdu and Tugtekin.

02:02:40.206 --> 02:02:43.507
Gumustekin is a wretched man who wouldn't
shy away from using his

02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:45.473
daughter and sister
to achieve his purpose.

02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:49.373
I am sure that Amerr Sadettin
knows everything.

02:02:49.607 --> 02:02:55.173
They are not doing all these to keep
Turkmen tribes in line, Bey.

02:02:55.573 --> 02:02:58.340
Amer Sadettin Kobek has a bigger aim.

02:02:59.107 --> 02:03:00.840
It is obvious that he has a
higher ambition.

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:02.673
I know, Artuk Bey.

02:03:03.607 --> 02:03:07.340
His aim is to spin a web around Sultan
Alaeddin's palace like a spider.

02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:11.540
Just as he brought a lap dog after
becoming a margrave,

02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:15.573
he will use a loyal man as Shahzade.

02:03:16.873 --> 02:03:19.373
It is our duty to foil his scheme.

02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:21.240
Of course, Bey.

02:03:30.107 --> 02:03:32.440
Ertugrul Bey, Aytolun Hatun
has left the nomad group.

02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:36.573
-Turgut.
-Yes, Bey.

02:03:36.907 --> 02:03:40.640
Tell Gunkut to tell Tugtekin that he saw
Banu Cicek near the nomad group.

02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:45.240
He cannot resist to follow her.
-As you command, Bey.

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:54.507
Go to Selcan Hatun and tell her that
Aytolun Hatun has left the nomad group.

02:03:55.207 --> 02:03:56.207
At once, Bey.

02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:03.107
God help you, Bey.

02:04:06.607 --> 02:04:07.607
Amen.

02:04:24.673 --> 02:04:26.373
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, Bey.

02:04:26.807 --> 02:04:28.307
-May it be easy.
-Thank you, Bey.

02:04:30.873 --> 02:04:32.873
-Have a prosperous day.
-Thank you, Bey.

02:04:34.373 --> 02:04:35.707
-May it be easy.
-Thank you, Bey.

02:04:36.173 --> 02:04:37.640
-Welcome, Bey.
-Thank you, thank you.

02:04:38.407 --> 02:04:40.340
-May it be easy.
-May God give you a long life, Bey.

02:04:40.507 --> 02:04:41.640
Welcome, Bey.

02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.707
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you. Welcome, Bey.

02:04:47.373 --> 02:04:49.473
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you. Welcome, Bey.

02:04:49.807 --> 02:04:51.173
Thank you, well met.

02:04:51.707 --> 02:04:53.673
How is the business in the bazaar?
There is not a problem, I hope?

02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:56.573
No, Bey. So far so good.
May God protect you.

02:04:56.807 --> 02:05:00.173
Thank you, amen. Thank you.
Have a prosperous day.

02:05:00.573 --> 02:05:01.707
-Thank you, Bey.
-May it be easy.

02:05:04.907 --> 02:05:08.340
From now on, we should take care
of the regulation of bazaar.

02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:11.373
We should listen to the troubles of people
and help them.

02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:13.540
Help them any way you can.

02:05:14.407 --> 02:05:20.540
But if you see a craftsman causing
trouble or defying orders, punish him.

02:05:21.207 --> 02:05:22.307
As you command, Bey.

02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:28.107
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, Bey.

02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:31.340
-Have a prosperous day.
-Thank you, welcome.

02:05:31.740 --> 02:05:32.740
Thank you.

02:05:37.207 --> 02:05:39.373
You took the trouble of
coming to our bazaar.

02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:42.107
If you accept, I want to give this
pot I made as a gift, Bey.

02:05:42.307 --> 02:05:43.307
Do not mention it.

02:05:44.173 --> 02:05:47.240
I would be honored to accept the gift of a
master craftman like you.

02:05:47.473 --> 02:05:49.173
-Thank you.
-But we should give this pot

02:05:49.373 --> 02:05:50.573
to a person who needs it.

02:05:52.207 --> 02:05:54.407
It would be a sin to keep it
when there are people in need.

02:05:55.407 --> 02:05:57.773
-You are right, Bey.
-Let us keep our people alive.

02:05:58.607 --> 02:06:01.740
So that they may keep our nomad group
and marquees alive.

02:06:02.407 --> 02:06:04.840
-You are right, Bey.
-Have a bountiful day.

02:06:05.273 --> 02:06:06.373
-Thank you, Bey.
-Thank you.

02:06:07.507 --> 02:06:08.873
Bey! Bey!

02:06:13.907 --> 02:06:15.840
I saw Banu Cicek down the river bed.

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:19.740
She was on her horse and I could not
follow her without my horse.

02:06:43.807 --> 02:06:45.440
May I, Selcan Hatun?

02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:47.640
Come in, Turali.

02:06:52.507 --> 02:06:53.507
Come in.

02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:56.773
Ertugrul Bey sent me.

02:06:57.607 --> 02:06:59.573
Aytolun Hatun went out
from the nomad tent.

02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:01.340
Thank God!

02:07:02.740 --> 02:07:04.540
Thank you, my brave Alp.

02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:55.907
Tracks end here, Bey.

02:07:57.240 --> 02:07:59.540
Bogac, Samsa, take Alps
and keep searching.

02:08:00.907 --> 02:08:01.907
As you command, Bey.

02:08:10.873 --> 02:08:12.307
What are you doing here, Ertugrul Bey?

02:08:13.473 --> 02:08:15.207
Did you come to save Banu Cicek?

02:08:17.907 --> 02:08:24.307
When I look at you, I see the same
wild horses racing in my heart, Tugtekin.

02:08:25.573 --> 02:08:28.407
You have a deep love for your nomad group.

02:08:29.173 --> 02:08:30.507
And you are making your ancestors proud.

02:08:31.773 --> 02:08:37.140
But I see that the wild horses in your
heart are blinded by your rage.

02:08:38.607 --> 02:08:41.240
Anger is a treacherous cliff, my friend.

02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:44.673
Be careful about what you are saying,
Ertugrul Bey.

02:08:45.307 --> 02:08:46.607
My patience is running thin.

02:08:48.140 --> 02:08:51.307
Remember the trouble Noyan put you in.

02:08:52.473 --> 02:08:54.807
You are in a bigger trouble now.

02:08:56.473 --> 02:08:59.507
Today, you will prove that
you are the Bey of Dodurga.

02:09:01.407 --> 02:09:02.873
I came here to take you to Banu Cicek.

02:09:03.873 --> 02:09:06.773
I will show you the trouble
they put you in.

02:09:08.873 --> 02:09:11.207
Don't be stubborn, come with me.

02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:13.707
See the truth with your own eyes.

02:11:13.673 --> 02:11:14.873
Patience, Tugtekin.

02:11:15.807 --> 02:11:18.373
Aytolun will be here here shortly
with grief.

02:11:28.607 --> 02:11:30.840
Banu Cicek, sister.

02:11:31.807 --> 02:11:32.907
Are you alright?

02:11:33.307 --> 02:11:34.873
I am fine, Selcan Hatun. I am fine.

02:11:35.607 --> 02:11:37.507
-How is your wound?
-It is okay.

02:11:37.740 --> 02:11:41.107
We were worried about you,
we could not sleep all night.

02:11:41.707 --> 02:11:45.573
Selcan Hatun, Does Dogan Alp
know that I am alive?

02:11:46.273 --> 02:11:49.507
Do not worry, sister.
Dogan knows that you are fine.

02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:52.140
-Good, good.
-Let me look.

02:12:03.173 --> 02:12:04.240
Selcan!

02:12:11.207 --> 02:12:14.240
Come here, you wretched woman.

02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:30.440
How did you come here, you witch?

02:12:31.473 --> 02:12:33.607
Give that to me, immediately.

02:12:34.273 --> 02:12:38.273
How do you know what I have?
How did you find our place?

02:12:38.873 --> 02:12:40.573
Just do as I say.

02:12:43.907 --> 02:12:47.840
We proved that you killed
Aunt Duru and my uncle.

02:12:48.473 --> 02:12:51.907
From now on, we are not afraid of you,
your brother

02:12:52.573 --> 02:12:55.140
and your imbecile nephew.

02:13:02.307 --> 02:13:03.673
Do you want this evidence?

02:13:04.607 --> 02:13:06.373
Come and take it, come on.

02:13:08.207 --> 02:13:11.840
But you will have to
kill us first to get it.

02:13:20.707 --> 02:13:27.107
You will never prove that I killed them.
