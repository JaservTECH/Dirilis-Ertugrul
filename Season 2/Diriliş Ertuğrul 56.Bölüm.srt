00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 56 will start after 12:20 min.

12:20.781 --> 12:24.781
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:42.643 --> 12:43.643
Stop!

12:51.776 --> 12:54.943
As your Sultan,
I order you to drop your sword.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.309
Child.

13:02.276 --> 13:05.176
Do not forget you are
under my liege, Noyan.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.909
Is that not right, Goncagul Hatun?

13:08.343 --> 13:09.976
Sultan is right.

13:22.143 --> 13:26.143
Even if 50 of your soldiers become one,
they would not match Turgut Alp.

13:27.709 --> 13:30.743
I would like an Alp such as
Turgut Alp to be under my service.

13:31.176 --> 13:34.876
Just as I want a strong soldiers
like yourself to be under my service.

13:41.043 --> 13:44.076
My sword will serve you so well...

13:52.809 --> 13:55.843
Sultan is right, Noyan.

13:56.943 --> 13:59.143
We both know Turgut Alp quite well.

13:59.209 --> 14:03.209
If he submits, he will be useful
for our Sultan's liege.

14:05.176 --> 14:08.109
I would like to see a valiant man
as Turgut Alp in my army.

14:08.176 --> 14:11.709
If he does not submit,
I, myself will do the necessary.

14:12.209 --> 14:13.876
Is it understood, Noyan?

14:15.809 --> 14:17.609
Then do it now.

14:17.676 --> 14:23.943
To hell with you
and these ignobles that use you.

14:26.209 --> 14:30.743
You became the shame of
Ertugrul Bey and Halime Sultan.

14:32.143 --> 14:34.043
Shame on you!

14:36.043 --> 14:38.976
Soldiers, take Turgut Alp and tie him.

14:39.043 --> 14:40.609
Let his anger subside.

14:41.076 --> 14:43.576
I will talk to him myself. Take him!

14:54.676 --> 14:57.109
Did you write the letter
for the nomad group, Sultan?

15:12.676 --> 15:15.543
It is just the request
of submission we wanted, Noyan.

15:17.343 --> 15:20.043
Let us see what the Beys
will do when they read this.

15:21.943 --> 15:25.243
We reached the end, Noyan.
Be a little more patient.

15:28.976 --> 15:33.009
Give the letter to Kungur Bey.
Let him send it to the nomad group.

15:45.909 --> 15:47.743
They tied both our hands.

15:48.109 --> 15:50.543
I last saw him
when they took me out of the den.

15:51.109 --> 15:53.043
He was shouting at them not to kill me.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.243
I can still hear his voice.

15:59.943 --> 16:02.076
Why did they put Yigit there, Dundar?

16:03.043 --> 16:04.576
What do they want from him?

16:04.643 --> 16:07.309
Noyan had no intention
to kill Yigit, Halime Sultan.

16:07.543 --> 16:08.943
Keep your heart at ease.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.676
You should know, Yigit is still alive.

16:12.109 --> 16:14.209
How can you know that, Dundar?

16:20.076 --> 16:21.743
Tell me. Speak.

16:24.676 --> 16:29.109
I heard it when they took me,
they are preparing a feast for Yigit.

16:34.676 --> 16:36.009
Dundar is right.

16:37.209 --> 16:39.843
They will not kill him, Halime Sultan.

16:39.909 --> 16:42.876
They will want to
use Shahzade as Ertugrul Bey said.

16:44.643 --> 16:46.276
Yigit Alp will not allow it.

16:54.309 --> 16:56.909
Halime, Gunduz is crying,
come and check on him.

17:12.543 --> 17:15.576
How can this miserable man
who Ogeday discharged from his army...

17:15.643 --> 17:18.643
....manage to get into this big of
a game with a few ravagers?

17:18.709 --> 17:21.543
And how can he dare to use Shahzada?

17:22.843 --> 17:26.843
Who is behind this?
We have to find out all of these.

17:26.909 --> 17:31.109
Can you still not see who
is behind Noyan, brother?

17:32.576 --> 17:34.143
Ameer Sadettin.

17:34.209 --> 17:36.309
What are you saying, Tugtekin Bey?

17:36.543 --> 17:38.643
I told you he saved my life.

17:40.543 --> 17:43.209
I see you think
the way Ertugrul does, Tugtekin Bey.

17:44.709 --> 17:48.143
I do not believe a word
Ameer Sadettin says, Sungurtekin Bey.

19:29.711 --> 19:35.577
<i>Unfortunately, the situation became more</i>
 <i>grave than you addressed in your letter.</i>

19:36.904 --> 19:41.271
<i>I came to know that three Turkmen Beys</i>
 <i>submitted to Shahzada Yigit....</i>

19:41.504 --> 19:44.971
<i>...as their Sultan</i>
 <i>by the Ayyubids' instigation.</i>

19:46.204 --> 19:49.504
<i>I have not even an ounce of doubt...</i>

19:49.571 --> 19:53.971
<i>...that this group of revolters will</i>
 <i>gradually increase and get wilder.</i>

19:55.237 --> 19:59.137
<i>And unfortunately my dire suspicions</i>
 <i>about Halime Sultan and her husband...</i>

19:59.204 --> 20:04.737
<i>...Ertugrul Bey coalescing with these</i>
 <i>revolters gradually grow stronger.</i>

20:06.571 --> 20:11.137
<i>Praying these doubts of mine</i>
 <i>are nothing but a misgiving...</i>

20:11.204 --> 20:16.237
<i>...I would like you to know that</i>
 <i>I will go to Kayi and Dodurga Tribes...</i>

20:17.037 --> 20:20.804
<i>...on the purpose of</i>
 <i>examining the situation on the site.</i>

20:21.271 --> 20:24.471
<i>As you addressed in your letter...</i>

20:24.537 --> 20:28.937
<i>...it will be good for you to come to</i>
 <i>Erzurum with your army, at all costs.</i>

21:29.271 --> 21:31.237
Come then, Sultan Aleaddin.

21:37.904 --> 21:41.004
Come, so you may
fall prey to your loyal dog.

21:53.204 --> 21:55.937
Your horse and
your soldiers are ready, his Ameer.

21:56.971 --> 21:58.004
Very well.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.737
His Ameer, you called for me.

22:13.771 --> 22:17.704
This letter will be conveyed
to Sultan Aleaddin immediately.

22:20.071 --> 22:23.837
And tell Merchant Abdullah
to meet me in the place.

22:31.704 --> 22:33.237
As you wish, Ameer.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.671
See what fate can bring, Goncagul Hatun.

23:29.237 --> 23:33.471
I, mighty Noyan with stormy
Mongol blood running in my veins...

23:34.637 --> 23:36.971
...am yielding to an infant in arms.

23:37.937 --> 23:43.771
Shahzada Yigit will bring us
Ertugrul, his brothers, his mother.

23:45.604 --> 23:51.037
Then we will knead our anguish,
our venom with their blood.

23:52.504 --> 23:53.871
Be patient a little longer.

23:54.504 --> 23:55.937
Be patient a little more, Noyan.

24:03.704 --> 24:04.704
And you?

24:05.704 --> 24:07.271
And you, Goncagul Hatun?

24:08.737 --> 24:10.204
What about your game?

24:12.737 --> 24:15.637
What does Sadettin ask from you for me?

24:26.270 --> 24:30.971
What did he promise you
as he promised to Tangut once?

24:32.071 --> 24:33.237
Tell me.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.137
To hell with that ignoble, Noyan.

25:02.604 --> 25:04.671
He is frightened by you, Noyan.

25:06.704 --> 25:08.937
He wants to know every step you take.

25:12.804 --> 25:17.671
He does his best to learn
when you will stab him on the back.

25:23.537 --> 25:27.704
A clever man like you
surely knows these, Noyan.

25:29.837 --> 25:36.537
Do you think of me as stupid to not know
Kobek will kill us both when time comes?

25:40.104 --> 25:44.571
I have no one
but you on this earth, Noyan.

25:45.237 --> 25:46.571
Do you not know that?

25:56.771 --> 26:02.804
Why, do you think Sadettin went into
such a dangerous way to kill Ertugrul?

26:05.771 --> 26:06.771
I know Kobek well.

26:07.804 --> 26:10.804
He thinks he is using
both of us to kill Ertugrul.

26:13.037 --> 26:16.471
Yet, this is not his real matter.

26:18.037 --> 26:20.071
Ertugrul is the hero
for both nomad groups.

26:20.737 --> 26:23.737
It is time he gets a taste of defeat.

26:23.804 --> 26:29.137
To one, the biggest strike
comes from his brothers.

26:29.737 --> 26:35.071
What if I saw discord
among Ertugrul's brothers?

26:39.837 --> 26:42.637
If he only desired to kill Ertugrul...

26:43.904 --> 26:46.171
...he would have
already done it with his army.

26:49.271 --> 26:50.571
What is his matter then?

26:54.271 --> 26:56.804
Let it be your duty to find it out.

26:58.904 --> 27:03.871
We shall learn so we can know
which soup's seasoning we are.

27:06.737 --> 27:09.271
Sadettin's time will come, after Ertugrul.

27:10.704 --> 27:16.137
Whoever betrays Noyan will pay
the heavy price of his betrayal.

27:19.004 --> 27:20.671
I wanted you to know that.

27:24.604 --> 27:25.604
Then?

27:30.571 --> 27:34.837
Do you know how did
the khan of the khans, Cenghis Khan...

27:36.971 --> 27:41.537
...form such a big worldwide
state on the vast deserts, all alone...

27:42.071 --> 27:47.037
...even though he was
betrayed so many times?

27:50.671 --> 27:53.604
That is the path God commanded me.

27:56.471 --> 28:02.937
Whoever walks with me on this path,
I will bring the world to their feet.

28:13.071 --> 28:14.104
Noyan.

28:14.804 --> 28:18.237
Ameer Sadettin sent word.
He would like to see you.

28:22.104 --> 28:24.037
Let us see what he wants this time.

28:26.704 --> 28:30.104
Ulubilge, keep the boy sweet.

28:31.271 --> 28:34.537
And Turgut may live for a few more days.

28:34.604 --> 28:36.971
Turgut was not alone when he came to den.

28:38.537 --> 28:41.704
Ertugrul and his Alps
will attack tomorrow morning.

28:43.837 --> 28:47.571
Let us not fail in showing them
hospitality when they arrive.

29:04.904 --> 29:06.971
He made Noyan kidnap Dundar and Yigit.

29:07.037 --> 29:09.571
And he deceived me
by handing me Dundar, is that so?

29:09.637 --> 29:11.504
Exactly so, brother.

29:11.571 --> 29:16.604
Ertugrul, I was by Ogeday's side
for years, I have seen many ruses.

29:16.671 --> 29:18.804
Did this man get into
such dangerous games...

29:18.871 --> 29:23.704
...only because you cut off Gumustekin's
head and laid his reputation to waste?

29:24.904 --> 29:26.104
Why?

29:26.171 --> 29:27.604
Why, Ertugrul? Why?

29:28.237 --> 29:30.771
Why would he get into such games...

29:30.837 --> 29:33.004
....when he could get you killed easily?

29:33.071 --> 29:34.237
Tell me that first.

29:39.737 --> 29:44.704
Do you know why Sultan does not
have any spies among Ogeday's army?

29:45.937 --> 29:47.737
Because we both made a mistake.

29:48.804 --> 29:54.937
We stopped Ameer Sadettin from using
Tangut, putting him in the army to spy.

29:58.271 --> 29:59.771
That is what I am saying.

30:01.104 --> 30:05.704
Why would this man down on us like
puerperal fever rather than killing me?

30:09.771 --> 30:12.037
Do you think I never think about these?

30:13.904 --> 30:15.537
You should know...

30:16.037 --> 30:21.804
...Kobek's problem is not the reputation
he lost because of Tangut or Gumustekin.

30:22.804 --> 30:25.271
He has a much wider range.

30:28.104 --> 30:30.004
That is what daunts me.

30:30.904 --> 30:34.004
And he wants to use
all of us for this range.

30:34.637 --> 30:35.804
Can you not see that?

30:36.504 --> 30:37.571
Open your eyes.

31:43.004 --> 31:44.271
Ameer Sadettin is here, Bey.

31:52.071 --> 31:54.637
Attend to his horses
and soldiers, Abdurrahman.

31:55.171 --> 31:57.804
We will greet him before the marquee.

31:57.871 --> 31:58.904
As you wish, Bey.

32:01.037 --> 32:04.604
You should know, he came
bringing a new trouble on us.

32:05.071 --> 32:07.871
-Ertugrul.
-I know what I am saying, brother.

32:12.571 --> 32:15.871
As I know the shadow
how he covered your eyes with.

32:16.571 --> 32:20.171
Luckily, I have a head enough to
know that I should not trust anyone...

32:20.237 --> 32:22.871
...to the end in the palace,
except for our Sultan.

32:23.637 --> 32:26.004
Let me do what is necessary.

32:26.071 --> 32:27.871
Where will it lead to?

32:27.937 --> 32:31.104
Will you come to your
senses when Kobek bites you?

32:31.171 --> 32:32.871
Enough! For God's sake, enough.

32:36.171 --> 32:38.971
I hate that ignoble as much as Ertugrul.

32:39.037 --> 32:43.537
Let him come to our marquee.
Let us see what he has got to say.

33:52.504 --> 33:54.204
Welcome, his Ameer.

33:55.937 --> 33:57.604
Thank you, Sungurtekin Bey.

34:01.504 --> 34:02.504
Tugtekin Bey.

34:04.271 --> 34:06.137
Welcome, Ameer Sadettin.

34:06.204 --> 34:07.604
Thank you, Dundar.

34:09.204 --> 34:12.237
You must have things
to talk, if you excuse me.

34:20.037 --> 34:24.004
May God bless him
to the ones he loves, to you.

34:24.071 --> 34:25.171
Thank you.

34:25.837 --> 34:27.504
Go ahead, his Ameer.

36:18.171 --> 36:19.171
Halime.

36:24.037 --> 36:26.704
I must hear what
Ameer Sadettin has to say.

36:31.504 --> 36:33.537
I know, it is about my brother.

36:36.204 --> 36:37.871
Halime.

36:46.604 --> 36:51.537
Sultan Aleaddin Keykubat
found out Shahzada Yigit was kidnapped.

36:53.637 --> 36:57.804
Himself wrote me a letter and
asked me to take measures urgently.

36:59.837 --> 37:02.171
Shahzada Yigit is not
a threat to our state.

37:02.871 --> 37:06.571
Shahzada Yigit's betrayal
is a grate danger...

37:06.637 --> 37:10.771
...not only for the continuity
of state but also for all of you.

37:11.804 --> 37:13.671
For all the Turkmen nomad groups.

37:14.571 --> 37:19.237
Shahzada fell into the hands of
both Ayyubids and the Templars.

37:19.837 --> 37:22.471
Yet, he did not become
an instrument in their game.

37:23.471 --> 37:27.037
He always showed his devotion
to his state, to his Sultan.

37:27.837 --> 37:29.871
They said the same for his father, too.

37:31.071 --> 37:36.737
But as you know better, Shahzada Numan
submitted to Ayyubids at his last times.

37:37.704 --> 37:40.471
He even attempted to rebel against state.

37:42.871 --> 37:45.604
How is it certain that
his son will not be like him?

37:48.537 --> 37:52.804
I have witnessed him standing straight
against the ones who wanted to use him.

37:56.537 --> 38:02.671
And what if I say three Turkmen Beys
submitted to him by kissing his hand?

38:09.737 --> 38:12.104
I will not believe it
until I see it myself.

38:17.904 --> 38:22.004
I do not know Shahzada.
However, as far as Ertugrul Bey told...

38:22.837 --> 38:26.471
...I do not deem it likely
he will resort to such business.

38:28.871 --> 38:31.137
Water sleeps but the enemy never does.

38:32.571 --> 38:33.771
Tugtekin Bey...

38:36.837 --> 38:40.504
...it is apparent Noyan coalesced with
the revolter Turkmen nomad groups.

38:44.637 --> 38:48.804
It must not have been hard
to deceive this poor boy...

38:48.871 --> 38:50.737
...who wants to avenge his father.

38:52.804 --> 38:56.104
Perhaps, that is why
Sultan heralded an edict...

38:56.171 --> 39:01.137
...that contains Shahzada Yigit
to be killed on the spot.

39:11.137 --> 39:15.871
And he is coming here with
his army to treat this matter.

39:21.171 --> 39:24.237
Halime, please, sit down.

39:24.471 --> 39:26.637
Halime, please.

39:28.271 --> 39:31.637
Halime, please stop. Stop.

40:30.904 --> 40:34.571
We have suffered many pains with you
at the Templars castle, Turgut Alp.

40:35.804 --> 40:38.471
You have never hesitated
to sacrifice yourself for me.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.604
I owe you my life, above all.

40:42.771 --> 40:45.204
I could not find it
in my heart for Noyan to kill you.

40:46.504 --> 40:49.204
Have you not had any lessons
from what you have been through?

40:50.137 --> 40:54.837
How can you still claim sultanate
upon the word of this ignoble herd?

40:56.937 --> 40:59.237
I was a child at that time.
I am not, anymore.

41:00.571 --> 41:02.104
I know the time has come, now.

41:03.571 --> 41:05.837
I will follow the path my destiny shows.

41:07.537 --> 41:09.504
You are in great negligence.

41:10.771 --> 41:11.771
I pity you, boy.

41:17.171 --> 41:20.837
Your life does not worth as much as
this wood under my feet, Turgut Alp.

41:22.237 --> 41:24.271
The day has come, fate is upside down.

41:25.237 --> 41:29.804
I will bereave the reign I deserve from
Sultan Aleaddin, my father's murderer.

41:31.671 --> 41:33.137
You should know my words.

41:34.671 --> 41:36.604
If it continues like this...

41:36.671 --> 41:39.971
...you should know that your death
will come from Ertugrul Bey's hands.

41:41.137 --> 41:43.904
He, too, will submit to me when
the time comes, Turgut Alp.

42:48.704 --> 42:54.104
How come Noyan suddenly came across them?

42:55.071 --> 42:57.137
How did they know they returned?

42:57.771 --> 43:01.037
We will find it out together,
if you help me in finding him.

43:03.604 --> 43:07.137
Do you want us to bring Shahzada Yigit
to you for you to slain him?

43:09.471 --> 43:16.037
As I see, neither you nor Tugtekin Bey
respect my or Sultan Aleaddin's words.

43:21.137 --> 43:25.137
Despite everything, I came here
trusting your loyalty to the state.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.471
Perhaps, I made a mistake.

43:29.804 --> 43:32.604
Now, I am asking you for the last time.

43:34.004 --> 43:37.071
Is there anything
you know but keep from me?

43:43.904 --> 43:45.837
No there is not, his Ameer.

43:46.804 --> 43:49.171
We learned whatever we know from you.

43:49.237 --> 43:51.637
I hope you are right, Sungurtekin Bey.

43:56.171 --> 43:58.737
And I understand you, Ertugrul Bey.

44:00.237 --> 44:04.604
You reproach a betrayal
as such to Halime Sultan's brother.

44:21.904 --> 44:23.804
Halime, what are you doing?

44:33.071 --> 44:36.871
However, past is composed of recurrence.

44:41.737 --> 44:42.904
It is true.

44:43.971 --> 44:46.871
Our past is extant
with glorious victories.

44:48.571 --> 44:53.604
But it is also a witness to
many shahzadas' treachery.

44:55.037 --> 44:58.637
And experiencing it again is negligence.

45:00.937 --> 45:03.104
Maybe that is the reason why...

45:03.171 --> 45:07.537
...every breath Shahzada Yigit
takes is a threat to our state.

45:16.537 --> 45:19.604
My brother would not revolt
against his state, Ameer Sadettin.

45:20.737 --> 45:23.504
Find Noyan, bring Yigit to me.

45:23.571 --> 45:24.737
Halime.

45:40.237 --> 45:42.471
May God bless your son to you.

45:44.971 --> 45:47.037
May He let him grow up with his parents.

45:57.971 --> 45:58.971
Bey.

45:59.604 --> 46:02.104
A letter came from Turkmen Bey, Konur Alp.

46:03.471 --> 46:06.171
The Alp who brought the letter
said that this was urgent.

46:18.104 --> 46:19.771
What does it say, brother?

46:23.604 --> 46:27.837
<i>I am the Sultan, shadow of God.</i>

46:29.571 --> 46:33.771
I, the delegate of justice and equity...

46:33.837 --> 46:37.504
...want Kayi and Dodurga nomad groups...

46:38.637 --> 46:44.537
...to submit to me as many
Turkmen Beys who submitted to me.

46:47.171 --> 46:50.804
Fight with me to rescue our state...

46:50.871 --> 46:54.771
...from Sultan Aleaddin's torment.

46:55.737 --> 46:58.704
Fight, so you may settle
in any place you wish.

47:00.071 --> 47:03.171
<i>The Sultan, shadow of God.</i>

47:04.171 --> 47:05.971
Sultan Izzettin Keykavus.

47:14.171 --> 47:20.004
Yigit Alp wants Hayme Hatun
and Tugtekin Bey to submit to him.

48:05.637 --> 48:11.271
Shahzada Yigit unashamedly deemed
himself worthy of the name Keykavus.

48:12.137 --> 48:16.737
He renders himself as
God's shadow on earth.

48:19.971 --> 48:21.204
This is a sin!

48:23.104 --> 48:24.104
This is sin!

48:26.071 --> 48:27.704
I was right again.

48:30.137 --> 48:32.104
I wish I was not right.

48:34.171 --> 48:35.637
But I was.

48:39.204 --> 48:40.871
If you receive any information...

48:41.937 --> 48:43.771
...you will let me know immediately.

48:45.204 --> 48:47.171
The arrow has left the bow now.

48:49.937 --> 48:52.771
The blood that will be shed
cannot stay in the vein.

48:54.104 --> 48:55.104
Do not forget...

48:55.871 --> 49:01.637
...who gets involved in this will share
the same destiny with Shahzada Yigit.

49:25.571 --> 49:26.571
Ameer Sadettin.

49:31.971 --> 49:34.104
You need not worry, Sungurtekin Bey.

49:34.971 --> 49:37.871
Ertugrul will remember
his loyalty to the state, for sure.

49:38.804 --> 49:41.971
But there is his love for Halime Sultan.

49:43.104 --> 49:45.037
I am afraid he will fall to his weakness.

49:46.104 --> 49:48.271
Sultan must have thought alike.

49:57.004 --> 50:00.604
He gave you a mission
to kill Shahzada Yigit.

50:02.704 --> 50:03.971
He wrote this letter to me.

50:04.604 --> 50:06.971
However, I do not see
any harm in you reading it.

50:07.037 --> 50:08.204
Read it.

50:21.504 --> 50:25.137
We need to sort this out
before Sultan Aleaddin arrives.

50:26.204 --> 50:30.471
Shahzada Yigit's head must be
taken to Sultan within a short time.

50:32.071 --> 50:34.537
Or else many people will die.

50:36.137 --> 50:38.670
You should know,
my door is always open to you.

50:41.737 --> 50:43.537
May God help us.

50:45.004 --> 50:48.804
His Ameer. Ertugrul Brother loved Yigit.

50:48.871 --> 50:51.937
If he uttered words that
offended you, forgive him.

50:56.104 --> 50:59.904
Do not worry, Dundar.
I know about everything.

51:03.904 --> 51:06.237
You are the future of Kayi Tribe.

51:09.237 --> 51:10.837
May God protect you.

51:21.704 --> 51:22.704
His Ameer.

51:54.571 --> 51:57.104
I hardly contained myself
to not to draw my sword...

51:57.171 --> 51:58.904
...and cut that dog in half.

52:01.137 --> 52:03.171
If it was not for my nomad group...

52:03.237 --> 52:06.971
...for you, I would make
my nomad group merry with his carrion.

52:08.237 --> 52:10.204
Its time will come, too, Tugtekin Bey.

52:11.037 --> 52:13.471
Sooner or later, its time will come, too.

52:14.904 --> 52:16.137
What about Sungurtekin?

52:16.871 --> 52:19.204
He exceedingly confides Ameer's words.

52:20.204 --> 52:24.204
It is evident, he will not see
the truth until Kobek bites.

52:32.804 --> 52:36.904
Tugtekin Bey, I will set off
immediately to find Yigit, if you allow.

52:36.971 --> 52:39.937
What will you do, brother?
Will you take the boy's life?

52:41.037 --> 52:44.504
If necessary, yes.
This not only our matter.

52:44.571 --> 52:46.871
It is a matter of the state's continuity.

52:53.804 --> 52:55.504
Geyikli is here, Bey.

52:55.571 --> 52:58.237
-He says he brought an important news.
-Let him come.

53:08.671 --> 53:10.037
We found Noyan's den, Bey.

53:11.837 --> 53:14.537
-Where is it located, Geyikli?
-It is at Dumanlıdag.

53:15.471 --> 53:19.137
We saw three Turkmen Beys.
We followed them.

53:19.204 --> 53:23.271
Mongols greeted them on the way.
They took the Beys to the den.

53:27.737 --> 53:30.571
They must be the Beys
Ameer Sadettin mentioned.

53:30.637 --> 53:32.204
He was right again.

53:36.604 --> 53:38.971
-Where is Turgut?
-He is waiting for us there, Bey.

53:39.837 --> 53:42.937
He is tracking how many
they are, where the watchmen are.

53:44.071 --> 53:46.671
If we set off soon,
we will be there by night.

53:46.737 --> 53:49.604
The ridgeway is too steep.
We cannot travel at night.

53:50.771 --> 53:52.571
Geyikli is right, Tugtekin Bey.

53:53.137 --> 53:56.171
Let us make our preparations,
we will take off at dawn.

53:59.004 --> 54:01.671
Go to Dogan and Bamsi's tent. Rest.

54:01.737 --> 54:04.104
And tell them to be ready.

54:04.171 --> 54:05.504
As you wish, Bey.

54:11.904 --> 54:14.971
Brother, I want Yigit alive.

54:15.971 --> 54:18.504
I want to hear
the situation from him, too.

54:19.171 --> 54:20.971
Promise me on that.

54:22.004 --> 54:25.204
Sultan has an edict about Shahzada Yigit.

54:26.071 --> 54:29.071
If you will act weakly, do not come.

54:32.504 --> 54:34.637
We will talk about it when night comes.

54:57.004 --> 55:01.837
If Ameer Sadettin did not ask for
Oghuz Khan's seal from my dad...

55:02.871 --> 55:04.637
...they would be alive now.

55:08.637 --> 55:12.937
He handed your father to Ertugrul's sword
when he wanted to kill me.

55:19.204 --> 55:23.171
My only solace is, thanks to that mite...

55:24.237 --> 55:26.804
...I have a real man like you, Noyan.

55:33.571 --> 55:36.671
And what about the smart one, Gundogdu?

55:38.837 --> 55:41.504
You would have been
his woman if these did not happen.

55:47.837 --> 55:49.671
He will die like Selcan, Noyan.

55:51.137 --> 55:54.004
I will kill them both.

56:22.637 --> 56:23.837
Peace be upon you.

56:24.537 --> 56:25.804
Peace be upon you, Bey.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.004
Bey?

56:35.704 --> 56:36.804
Sungurtekin.

56:37.937 --> 56:42.104
He said Sadettin Kobek would not get into
such a big game only to get rid of me.

56:43.804 --> 56:45.004
He is right.

56:46.037 --> 56:47.871
I think alike, too, Bey.

56:47.937 --> 56:51.204
Sadettin Kobek must have
another deal other than this.

56:52.471 --> 56:58.071
However we should not forget,
Yigit grew up. He is matured.

56:59.037 --> 57:01.837
What if he was mesmerized
by the sultanate throne...

57:01.904 --> 57:03.704
...and his eyes were blinded?

57:07.104 --> 57:11.104
I think Yigit is doing what he is
asked to survive, Artuk Bey.

57:12.171 --> 57:18.237
But if the ones that tempted him
deceived him with a sultanate tale...

57:20.537 --> 57:22.637
...the aftermath will be calamity.

57:22.704 --> 57:25.804
God forbid, this would be
calamity for all of us, Bey.

57:28.771 --> 57:31.737
And Kobek? What is his deal, Bey?

57:33.237 --> 57:35.904
He said it with his own words
in my mother's marquee.

57:35.971 --> 57:41.104
To bring Sultan Aleaddin to Erzurum
by using three imprudent Turkmen Beys.

57:43.471 --> 57:44.737
And he achieved it.

57:49.204 --> 57:54.871
My real fear is Kobek's target
being Sultan Aleaddin.

57:58.237 --> 57:59.804
What are you talking about?

58:00.804 --> 58:03.571
You said Sultan
was coming with his soldiers.

58:05.904 --> 58:08.137
He cannot attempt
such a thing against Sultan.

58:09.204 --> 58:12.837
Sultan's soldiers protect him
only from his enemies, Artuk Bey.

58:12.904 --> 58:15.671
They cannot protect him from
his own ameer in Erzurum.

58:20.471 --> 58:22.171
Then what will you do, Bey?

58:23.837 --> 58:25.104
I will do nothing.

58:28.004 --> 58:29.637
They will do what they will.

58:30.604 --> 58:35.504
My part will be to go into
the trap they laid with my own feet.

58:46.574 --> 58:49.307
They already enacted the death warrant.

58:49.374 --> 58:51.607
They named my brother as a traitor.

58:53.374 --> 58:55.574
How can they believe it, Selcan?

58:56.241 --> 58:58.774
My brother would not fall
to the sultanate greed...

58:58.841 --> 59:00.774
...with the instigation of a betrayer.

59:01.574 --> 59:05.974
Do not worry Halime. The truth will
come out before Yigit is harmed.

59:07.274 --> 59:10.441
What if they execute my brother
before the truth comes out?

59:12.274 --> 59:15.574
Halime, your heart's fire
makes you say these.

59:16.607 --> 59:18.641
Please, do not think bad.

59:19.707 --> 59:22.941
God wiling, you will
regain your brother unharmed.

59:23.007 --> 59:24.007
If God permits.

59:25.041 --> 59:27.941
God, bless my brother to me.

59:30.407 --> 59:31.474
<i>Is there permission?</i>

59:32.607 --> 59:33.674
Come in, Ertugrul Bey.

59:50.674 --> 59:53.374
What kind of games are played
upon my brother, Ertugrul?

59:53.907 --> 59:55.007
I cannot understand.

00:59:57.674 --> 01:00:01.607
It is obvious that Kobek
is using Yigit for his aims.

01:00:02.774 --> 01:00:06.007
And he has Noyan
in his palms, playing with him.

01:00:08.041 --> 01:00:11.241
We will not stand idly while
they are setting these traps for us.

01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:16.674
Keep your heart at ease. I will save
Yigit from those carrion crows.

01:00:17.974 --> 01:00:21.341
There is not one trace of Yigit,
Ertugrul. How will you do it?

01:00:22.274 --> 01:00:23.807
I found Noyan's den.

01:00:25.674 --> 01:00:27.274
What are you saying, Ertugrul?

01:00:28.741 --> 01:00:32.941
Ertugrul Bey, Mother Hayme
and Gundogdu Bey are coming.

01:00:41.774 --> 01:00:43.941
-Welcome.
-Welcome, Bey.

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:47.841
-Welcome, Bey, may God heal you.
-Thank you.

01:00:47.907 --> 01:00:49.574
Welcome, Bey.

01:00:56.607 --> 01:00:59.274
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

01:01:11.307 --> 01:01:12.307
Gundogdu!

01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:14.974
Are you healed?

01:01:15.041 --> 01:01:16.474
-I am fine.
-Thank God.

01:01:19.774 --> 01:01:21.307
-Mother!
-Daughter!

01:01:21.841 --> 01:01:24.507
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

01:01:31.574 --> 01:01:33.441
-Mother!
-Dundar!

01:01:37.274 --> 01:01:38.374
Son!

01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:43.574
My son!

01:01:44.507 --> 01:01:46.507
-Welcome.
-Thank you mother.

01:01:46.574 --> 01:01:47.841
Thank God.

01:01:52.574 --> 01:01:54.441
My boy has become an Alp!

01:01:56.607 --> 01:01:58.307
-God bless, brother!
-Brother.

01:02:02.674 --> 01:02:04.574
-Welcome, mother.
-Thank you, son.

01:02:04.941 --> 01:02:06.041
They said you were ill.

01:02:06.274 --> 01:02:08.341
-I hope you are alright.
-Who said it?

01:02:08.407 --> 01:02:12.474
Whoever said it lied, brother.
I am rock solid. Thank you.

01:02:12.541 --> 01:02:13.707
Brother.

01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:18.274
-May it be gone, brother.
-Thank you, brother.

01:02:19.607 --> 01:02:21.541
How is my daughter, Halime?

01:02:22.507 --> 01:02:24.007
We had a son, mother.

01:02:26.807 --> 01:02:28.974
We named him Gunduz
as my father bequeathed.

01:02:29.941 --> 01:02:31.541
God bless, brother!

01:02:31.607 --> 01:02:33.907
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, brother.

01:02:34.774 --> 01:02:39.007
Congratulations. May he grow up
with his mother and father.

01:02:39.241 --> 01:02:40.241
Amen, mother.

01:02:40.307 --> 01:02:44.474
Thank God! Now our marquee will be
merry with the voice of our children.

01:02:45.241 --> 01:02:47.607
If God permits,
our children will grow up together.

01:02:47.674 --> 01:02:49.341
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

01:02:50.374 --> 01:02:51.807
Thank God.

01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:54.807
I should hold
my grandchild in my arms now.

01:02:54.874 --> 01:02:56.307
Mother.

01:03:04.841 --> 01:03:08.707
Noyan laid an ambush
while the boys were coming back.

01:03:11.941 --> 01:03:15.041
I was there, too. I could not stop it.

01:03:15.807 --> 01:03:18.541
Noyan kidnapped Dundar and Yigit.

01:03:20.907 --> 01:03:22.307
Welcome, mother.

01:03:23.441 --> 01:03:24.441
Brother.

01:03:26.541 --> 01:03:30.707
Ameer Sadettin rescued Dundar from
Noyan's hands and gave him to us, mother.

01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:37.507
I am fine mother. Do not worry.

01:03:39.541 --> 01:03:40.741
And Yigit?

01:03:41.941 --> 01:03:43.674
He is in Noyan's hands, brother.

01:03:49.441 --> 01:03:50.607
Halime.

01:04:11.407 --> 01:04:12.641
Welcome, mother.

01:04:13.341 --> 01:04:14.741
Gundogdu Brother.

01:04:14.807 --> 01:04:16.741
Thank you, my child.

01:04:16.807 --> 01:04:21.507
Congratulations.
May he grow up with his parents.

01:04:21.574 --> 01:04:23.807
May God protect him from evil.

01:04:24.774 --> 01:04:25.974
Thank you, mother.

01:04:29.274 --> 01:04:31.441
May God bless, brother. Praise be!

01:04:31.507 --> 01:04:32.807
Thank you, brother.

01:04:43.474 --> 01:04:46.007
May my mighty God render you sacred.

01:04:46.607 --> 01:04:50.041
May he continue your kin, your tribe.

01:04:52.007 --> 01:04:54.607
May he keep you away from calamities.

01:04:55.574 --> 01:04:57.741
May he render you beloved in both worlds.

01:04:58.541 --> 01:05:04.941
May God not shear you from your father's
mercy, from your mother's affection.

01:05:05.007 --> 01:05:06.407
Amen.

01:05:08.741 --> 01:05:11.941
May benison reach
to my nomad tent with your arrival.

01:05:12.874 --> 01:05:14.674
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:05:19.674 --> 01:05:24.307
My God, who bestowed you to us
will hopefully bestow Yigit Alp, too.

01:05:25.607 --> 01:05:30.474
Hopefully, he will return among us
in goodness and health, in no time.

01:05:30.541 --> 01:05:31.941
If God permits.

01:05:34.341 --> 01:05:36.374
We found Noyan's den mother.

01:05:37.707 --> 01:05:39.341
Thank God.

01:05:40.574 --> 01:05:43.974
If God allows, we will
pull Yigit out of this trouble.

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:46.774
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

01:05:49.774 --> 01:05:50.974
If God permits.

01:06:14.974 --> 01:06:17.774
Was Turgut Alp alone when he got caught?

01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:18.874
He was.

01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:22.007
There certainly was someone else with him.

01:06:22.974 --> 01:06:25.407
They must have already
sent a message to Ertugrul.

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:28.541
They will not venture to come at night.

01:06:29.474 --> 01:06:32.374
They will attack my den
tomorrow when the sun is rising.

01:06:35.607 --> 01:06:38.441
They will not find Turgut Alp there.

01:06:38.941 --> 01:06:39.941
Then what?

01:06:41.341 --> 01:06:45.307
They will attack with
a bigger rage to save Turgut like Yigit.

01:06:46.307 --> 01:06:51.341
I have laid such a trap on them that
none of them will get out of there alive.

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:53.841
Ertugrul will die tomorrow.

01:06:58.341 --> 01:07:01.041
Ertugrul's death does not
serve my purpose yet, Noyan.

01:07:04.307 --> 01:07:05.907
What are you saying, Sadettin?

01:07:06.707 --> 01:07:10.307
I tell you Ertugrul will die, you say
it does not serve your purpose.

01:07:10.374 --> 01:07:12.607
I am tired of your secretive moods.

01:07:13.907 --> 01:07:16.507
What crosses your mind?
Say it, so we know, too.

01:07:21.507 --> 01:07:26.307
All three of us want Ertugrul's
head, there is no harm in it.

01:07:26.374 --> 01:07:30.374
I will give you Ertugrul when it is time
for it. But everything has its time.

01:07:32.807 --> 01:07:36.474
First, I want to mar the alliance
between Kayi and Dodurga nomad groups.

01:07:36.941 --> 01:07:39.307
So, what is on your mind? Tell me.

01:07:43.341 --> 01:07:47.007
While your soldiers are trapping
the Alps going to the den...

01:07:47.241 --> 01:07:49.574
...you will kidnap
Gokce Hatun from the tent.

01:07:52.274 --> 01:07:54.741
What will you do with
the Fiery Boy's wife?

01:07:59.974 --> 01:08:01.941
Gokce Hatun will bring you Tugtekin.

01:08:03.441 --> 01:08:06.407
Were you not taking oaths
you will extinct Ertugrul's kin?

01:08:06.474 --> 01:08:07.641
Here is your chance.

01:08:08.274 --> 01:08:11.274
You will kill Tugtekin,
who shares Ertugrul's blood.

01:08:12.741 --> 01:08:13.907
You will kill him...

01:08:14.807 --> 01:08:18.874
...so I can bring loyal Sungurtekin
to the position he deserves.

01:08:37.607 --> 01:08:39.907
Turgut will be waiting in this area.

01:08:40.507 --> 01:08:41.741
The den is here.

01:08:41.807 --> 01:08:44.041
When Turgut tells us
where the watchmen are...

01:08:44.807 --> 01:08:47.374
...and how crowded they are...

01:08:48.274 --> 01:08:49.541
...we will attack the den.

01:08:50.407 --> 01:08:51.841
We should leave the horses here.

01:08:52.474 --> 01:08:54.041
It would be smarter to go on foot.

01:08:54.674 --> 01:08:59.241
If Noyan notices we came,
we can never see Yigit Alp's face again.

01:08:59.307 --> 01:09:01.674
We have to take him
from him unhurt, brother.

01:09:02.374 --> 01:09:04.607
What will happen
if we take Yigit unharmed.

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:06.341
We cannot bring him here.

01:09:07.474 --> 01:09:10.974
If we give him to Ameer Sadettin,
he will execute him right there.

01:09:11.774 --> 01:09:13.641
What is necessary should be done there.

01:09:18.307 --> 01:09:19.541
What are you saying?

01:09:19.607 --> 01:09:21.974
Are you talking about killing him there?

01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:25.607
Sultan's edict is evident, Ertugrul.
He will be executed on the spot.

01:09:28.974 --> 01:09:31.507
There is no coming back
from this. Not for any of us.

01:09:35.774 --> 01:09:38.474
We cannot endanger our nomad group...

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:41.507
...for a foolish boy
who declared his sultanate.

01:09:41.574 --> 01:09:44.707
Brother, Yigit is Halime's brother.

01:09:44.774 --> 01:09:47.241
<i>We are not only going</i>
 <i>there to free Yigit...</i>

01:09:47.307 --> 01:09:49.641
...but also to shatter Kobek's game.

01:09:49.707 --> 01:09:52.241
You are still saying
the same things, Ertugrul.

01:09:52.974 --> 01:09:55.674
You told us how both Yigit
and his father were made...

01:09:55.741 --> 01:09:58.374
...a cat's paw
of the Templars and Ayyubids.

01:09:58.441 --> 01:10:02.441
You have seen and lived all these things
and you still want to save that boy?

01:10:02.507 --> 01:10:04.507
This boy announced his sultanate.

01:10:04.941 --> 01:10:08.941
He asked for both my mom
and Tugtekin to submit to him.

01:10:09.574 --> 01:10:11.841
Do you not see
they are using him, brother?

01:10:11.907 --> 01:10:13.507
What does it change, Ertugrul?

01:10:13.574 --> 01:10:16.341
Sultan Aleaddin is already
on the way with his army.

01:10:16.741 --> 01:10:18.041
He is coming here.

01:10:18.641 --> 01:10:21.841
For now, three nomad groups
resorted to revoltion.

01:10:21.907 --> 01:10:24.607
Perhaps other nomad groups
will join the revoltion after.

01:10:25.641 --> 01:10:30.707
Every minute, every day
Yigit is alive is a threat to the state.

01:10:31.541 --> 01:10:37.474
Do not drag us to unpredictable ways
because he is Halime Sultan's brother.

01:10:38.374 --> 01:10:40.707
-What I...
-Enough!

01:10:40.774 --> 01:10:41.941
Enough!

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:47.374
Before one trouble ends, the other starts.

01:10:47.807 --> 01:10:50.974
And you fall out with
each other as if it was not enough.

01:10:54.374 --> 01:10:57.374
Ertugrul, Sungurtekin is right.

01:10:57.974 --> 01:11:01.907
Yigit is not only a threat to
the state but to us, as well.

01:11:03.907 --> 01:11:08.374
Do the raid
and wreck his den on Noyan's head first.

01:11:10.841 --> 01:11:15.274
As for Shahzada Yigit,
since you do not trust Kobek...

01:11:15.841 --> 01:11:21.374
...then you will surrender him to
Sultan whom we fought for, for years.

01:11:23.707 --> 01:11:27.307
After that Shahzada Yigit's life...

01:11:27.374 --> 01:11:31.974
...will be left to
Sultan's mercy and justice.

01:12:58.407 --> 01:12:59.707
His Ameer.

01:13:01.674 --> 01:13:03.341
Welcome, Bogac Alp.

01:13:05.974 --> 01:13:09.807
We will go somewhere
with Alps to raid in the morning.

01:13:10.907 --> 01:13:14.774
But the Beys keep where
we will go like a secret.

01:13:16.441 --> 01:13:18.041
I know where you will go.

01:13:18.907 --> 01:13:21.407
But you will not go to raid with them.

01:13:21.474 --> 01:13:23.507
What do you order me to do, his Ameer?

01:13:24.474 --> 01:13:25.907
One last mission, Bogac Alp.

01:13:35.407 --> 01:13:37.274
One more mission.

01:13:39.007 --> 01:13:44.974
God willing, when we finish
this business, I will go to Konya.

01:13:46.674 --> 01:13:51.307
I want you to come with me
and be under my retinue.

01:13:53.541 --> 01:13:55.707
However you deem fit, his Ameer.

01:13:57.607 --> 01:14:00.241
Then you will hand over
Gokce Hatun to Noyan.

01:14:02.741 --> 01:14:04.007
Noyan?

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:12.307
Do not worry. Noyan now knows
whose side he will fight, as you do.

01:14:13.474 --> 01:14:18.274
He chose to be
a loyal servant of state as you.

01:14:22.941 --> 01:14:25.807
-I am at your service, his Ameer.
-Very well.

01:14:26.874 --> 01:14:28.574
What would you like me to do?

01:14:31.641 --> 01:14:32.741
First...

01:14:34.407 --> 01:14:37.574
...you will find an opportunity
and enter Tugtekin's nomad tent.

01:14:59.307 --> 01:15:00.441
Sit down.

01:15:10.841 --> 01:15:12.641
How are the preparations going?

01:15:12.707 --> 01:15:15.041
You will set off before
the sun rises, Sultan.

01:15:15.874 --> 01:15:19.707
Your loyal Beys will take you
to your auspicious army.

01:15:19.774 --> 01:15:22.407
And my soldiers will
accompany you, Sultan.

01:15:23.807 --> 01:15:28.341
Many valiant men who are ready to die
for you are raring to see you, Sultan.

01:15:29.341 --> 01:15:34.407
When Sultan Aleaddin comes,
yourself will take his head, my Sultan.

01:15:34.474 --> 01:15:37.607
You will avenge your father's shed blood.

01:15:38.741 --> 01:15:41.941
Kaya Bey of Kefersud
and Kutlu Bey of Harput...

01:15:42.007 --> 01:15:45.341
...has set off with their Alps
to join your army, Sultan.

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:47.874
Your being has empowered us, Sultan.

01:15:48.974 --> 01:15:50.941
May God bless you to us.

01:15:54.441 --> 01:15:56.641
Is there any news from
Sultan Aleaddin, Noyan?

01:15:57.274 --> 01:16:00.574
We heard he set off
from Konya with his army.

01:16:00.641 --> 01:16:03.274
Now it is time for revenge for all of us.

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:40.541
We will rescue Yigit Alp and make
Mongols scarcer than hen's teeth.

01:16:41.641 --> 01:16:44.641
Then we will migrate to Byzantium
border with our minds at ease.

01:16:46.007 --> 01:16:49.674
Even though the conditions
are arduous the time to migrate has come.

01:16:53.341 --> 01:16:55.941
No matter how arduous
the conditions are....

01:16:56.007 --> 01:16:59.341
...there is always
a solution for us believers.

01:16:59.874 --> 01:17:02.841
Let's keep our hope abiding, brothers.

01:17:05.041 --> 01:17:07.774
Where we will migrate to
will not be a palace, brothers.

01:17:07.841 --> 01:17:09.941
Many troubles will pursue us there, too.

01:17:12.007 --> 01:17:15.007
Brother, as long as
the love of God is within us...

01:17:15.241 --> 01:17:17.407
...is there any palace
more divine than heart?

01:17:18.774 --> 01:17:20.407
Thank you, Bamsi Brother.

01:17:24.674 --> 01:17:27.907
-God bless your hands, Banu Cicek Hatun.
-Enjoy, Dervish Ishak.

01:17:29.274 --> 01:17:31.641
God bless your hands, sister.

01:17:31.707 --> 01:17:32.941
Thank you, Bamsi Beyrek.

01:17:35.474 --> 01:17:40.307
God, we are grateful to you
for the food you give us.

01:17:41.007 --> 01:17:46.841
Feed the hungry, the helpless,
the orphan and the homeless as you fed us.

01:17:47.707 --> 01:17:50.974
God, do not test us with hunger
and put to the proof with fullness.

01:17:51.941 --> 01:17:54.807
Make us of the ones
who appreciate the food you give.

01:17:55.574 --> 01:17:59.241
And render us of the ones
who are always grateful to you. Amen.

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.574
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:18:08.307 --> 01:18:09.907
Where are your thoughts lost in?

01:18:16.741 --> 01:18:19.341
I am talking to you.
What are you thinking about?

01:18:21.674 --> 01:18:25.441
Brother, I was thinking about
the beauty of being grateful.

01:18:26.407 --> 01:18:29.707
The man who knows
to be grateful, knows himself.

01:18:29.774 --> 01:18:32.541
Who knows himself, knows God, brother.

01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:38.541
Who knows his God,
sees and knows his helplessness.

01:18:39.441 --> 01:18:46.441
With that he becomes always grateful
to blessings God gives, brother.

01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:52.641
Thank you, Bamsi Brother.

01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:18.607
I saw your excitement when
Halime Sultan gave birth to her son.

01:21:21.241 --> 01:21:24.341
Your joy when Ertugrul hold his child.

01:21:27.407 --> 01:21:29.674
Ertugrul Bey has been a brother to me.

01:21:31.441 --> 01:21:33.841
And Halime Sultan
has become my sister now.

01:21:36.341 --> 01:21:38.607
And their child is
more than my own child.

01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:43.707
Gokce.

01:21:55.541 --> 01:21:58.507
You told me, I taught you
to love and to be loved.

01:22:01.407 --> 01:22:02.507
Why me?

01:22:06.807 --> 01:22:08.907
You taught me to love, Bey.

01:22:12.307 --> 01:22:16.907
You taught me not to be
a foolish child but a real woman.

01:22:20.041 --> 01:22:21.841
Thus, it is you.

01:22:29.274 --> 01:22:31.307
Even though you hate me...

01:22:35.807 --> 01:22:38.607
...even if I don't have as much worth...

01:22:41.274 --> 01:22:43.641
...as the dust on your boot...

01:22:51.241 --> 01:22:53.507
...I will love you until my last breath.

01:22:58.941 --> 01:23:01.874
If it is in my destiny
to love and not to be loved...

01:23:03.974 --> 01:23:05.441
...I will bow to my destiny.

01:23:14.774 --> 01:23:15.841
Gokce.

01:23:32.974 --> 01:23:35.274
Even if you cannot give me a child...

01:23:37.007 --> 01:23:38.841
...always give me life.

01:25:00.574 --> 01:25:02.574
I feel your pain in my heart, Halime.

01:25:03.707 --> 01:25:07.474
Be it my oath,
I will not make your brother a prey...

01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:09.407
....neither to Noyan nor Kobek.

01:25:09.974 --> 01:25:12.974
I will burn down
Noyan's den and save him.

01:25:13.607 --> 01:25:16.007
I have not an ounce
of doubt on it, Ertugrul.

01:25:16.607 --> 01:25:18.907
I remember how you
saved us from  the Templars...

01:25:18.974 --> 01:25:20.407
...as if it was yesterday.

01:25:22.707 --> 01:25:23.941
Yet...

01:25:29.307 --> 01:25:30.674
Why quiet, Halime?

01:25:32.041 --> 01:25:36.441
It is different this time. The ones
who think of my brother as a traitor...

01:25:36.507 --> 01:25:39.641
...desire his flesh,
his blood like hungry wolves.

01:25:43.874 --> 01:25:44.874
What if...

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:49.307
...Yigit wants to become
Sultan by his own will?

01:25:51.441 --> 01:25:53.007
What are you saying, Ertugrul?

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:56.607
How can you deem it likely
Yigit would fall to such negligence?

01:25:58.741 --> 01:26:01.441
Let's pray he did not fall
to such negligence.

01:26:01.507 --> 01:26:04.541
Or I have to surrender him to
Sultan with my own hands.

01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:13.274
If he did such a thing,
it is my duty to take his life.

01:27:04.907 --> 01:27:07.041
Bey. Tugtekin Bey.

01:27:18.407 --> 01:27:21.807
The horse is foundering.
It obviously hurts.

01:27:21.874 --> 01:27:23.274
It cannot ride.

01:27:24.441 --> 01:27:26.707
What is it, Bogac?
What is wrong with the animal?

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:28.941
Bey, it was fine when
we left the nomad tent.

01:27:29.007 --> 01:27:30.874
But now there is an oddness.

01:27:39.707 --> 01:27:43.674
Bogac, return to nomad tent.
Do not be a burden to us at war.

01:27:44.641 --> 01:27:45.974
As you wish, Bey.

01:28:19.374 --> 01:28:23.807
Artuk Bey, the ointment you asked
me to make for Gundogdu Bey's arm.

01:28:23.874 --> 01:28:26.341
-Here.
-Thank you, Dervish.

01:28:26.407 --> 01:28:29.541
Dervish Ishak,
may God be pleased with you.

01:28:29.607 --> 01:28:33.241
You suffered so much for me.
Do not withhold your prayers from us.

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:34.774
No need to mention.

01:28:34.841 --> 01:28:37.541
God is the one giving both
the trouble and the cure.

01:28:37.607 --> 01:28:39.041
Thank you.

01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:44.407
-If I may be excused to leave.
-You are excused.

01:28:45.974 --> 01:28:48.541
-Here, Selcan Hatun.
-Thank you, Bey.

01:28:51.474 --> 01:28:54.274
The furuncle is almost dry.

01:28:54.807 --> 01:28:57.507
The head doctor
in Erzurum showed his skill.

01:28:58.407 --> 01:29:00.707
-Your arm is getting better.
-Thank God.

01:29:01.841 --> 01:29:03.874
I have almost regained my strength, too.

01:29:03.941 --> 01:29:06.941
I would like to be at war
with my brothers in short time.

01:29:07.007 --> 01:29:10.707
Do not worry, Bey. What you said
will happen soon, if God permits.

01:29:10.774 --> 01:29:12.274
If God permits.

01:29:13.407 --> 01:29:14.941
If God permits.

01:29:15.007 --> 01:29:20.807
However, I do not see Ertugrul's and
nomad group's condition as too well.

01:29:37.007 --> 01:29:42.374
Rest assured, Bey. Just as how
Ertugrul Bey succeeded before...

01:29:42.441 --> 01:29:45.507
...he will do all he can after this, too.

01:29:45.574 --> 01:29:50.707
Surely, surely Artuk Bey but this time
the continuity of the state is in danger.

01:29:50.774 --> 01:29:55.807
Ameer Sadettin coming to the nomad tent,
Sultan Aleaddin knowing it...

01:29:55.874 --> 01:29:59.941
...gathering his armies, setting off...
These are not good signs.

01:30:00.974 --> 01:30:04.341
Moreover, my brother
renders Ameer Sadettin...

01:30:04.407 --> 01:30:07.507
...as his enemy rather than Noyan.

01:30:07.974 --> 01:30:09.574
This is no good.

01:32:58.807 --> 01:32:59.974
Geyikli.

01:33:01.474 --> 01:33:02.907
Are you certain it is here?

01:33:07.907 --> 01:33:08.907
Yes, Bey.

01:33:09.641 --> 01:33:12.407
Turgut Brother said
he would wait for us here.

01:33:17.307 --> 01:33:20.707
Bey. Or is what I think...

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:26.874
What is it that you think?
I do not understand.

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:34.541
They captured Turgut, Bamsi.

01:33:35.841 --> 01:33:36.941
Turgut Brother.

01:33:37.641 --> 01:33:38.907
Turgut Brother!

01:34:04.707 --> 01:34:06.741
What is it, brother?

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:08.307
They have Turgut, brother.

01:34:09.507 --> 01:34:11.241
He said he would wait for us here.

01:34:13.674 --> 01:34:16.474
He would have come forth
by now if there was not a trouble.

01:34:17.574 --> 01:34:20.874
There is no time to lose then.
Let us hit the road quickly.

01:34:22.507 --> 01:34:26.607
If Noyan captured Turgut,
it means he knows we will come, too.

01:34:28.774 --> 01:34:30.407
There can be traps everywhere.

01:34:31.641 --> 01:34:32.841
Let us move carefully.

01:34:51.007 --> 01:34:52.641
Okay.

01:35:15.607 --> 01:35:18.241
Our beloveds will return safely, Halime.

01:35:20.874 --> 01:35:23.641
If God permits,
they will bring Yigit Alp, too.

01:35:25.341 --> 01:35:26.774
If God permits, Gokce.

01:35:42.941 --> 01:35:47.407
I want you to find peace,
be happy with your son now.

01:35:47.474 --> 01:35:48.941
All together, Gokce.

01:35:49.007 --> 01:35:50.674
Altogether, if God permits.

01:35:53.574 --> 01:35:55.807
I have treated you
badly many times in past.

01:35:58.374 --> 01:35:59.774
And I hurt you many times.

01:36:02.707 --> 01:36:04.474
Forgive me, will you?

01:36:05.707 --> 01:36:06.774
Come.

01:36:10.607 --> 01:36:13.641
I do not have
one sibling anymore, I have three.

01:36:15.774 --> 01:36:18.507
May God unite us with
the ones we love, Gokce.

01:36:19.841 --> 01:36:24.874
May he save them from war, from captivity
and destine them to come to us safely.

01:36:24.941 --> 01:36:25.974
Amen.

01:38:10.585 --> 01:38:13.251
So you are out hunting, Fiery Boy.

01:38:14.418 --> 01:38:17.851
You do not know that
you will be the prey and lose your wife.

01:38:19.851 --> 01:38:22.418
Do not draw. Let them pass and go.

01:38:39.051 --> 01:38:40.918
Let us rest here a while.

01:38:43.151 --> 01:38:44.485
Sit here.

01:41:15.118 --> 01:41:17.451
We are close to Noyan's den, Bey.

01:41:18.051 --> 01:41:20.285
The den is a little bit ahead.

01:41:25.885 --> 01:41:28.118
He has both Turgut and Yigit.

01:41:28.918 --> 01:41:33.018
Our one small mistake
may cost their lives.

01:41:33.085 --> 01:41:35.051
Do not worry, Ertugrul Bey.

01:41:36.151 --> 01:41:38.551
We must take them out of there safely.

01:41:40.085 --> 01:41:41.818
That is what I want, too, Ertugrul.

01:41:42.351 --> 01:41:44.385
First, let us reach to the den safely.

01:41:45.551 --> 01:41:47.885
May God help us.

01:41:47.951 --> 01:41:49.485
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:41:50.151 --> 01:41:52.385
Come on, brothers, in the name of God.

01:42:37.418 --> 01:42:39.118
Look at you.

01:42:40.218 --> 01:42:42.251
You will be sultan...

01:42:43.185 --> 01:42:46.185
...of this herd of ignobles,
in those shiny clothes, is that so?

01:42:47.251 --> 01:42:48.285
Is this what you want?

01:42:50.385 --> 01:42:52.518
Do not push my patience, Turgut Alp.

01:42:53.418 --> 01:42:58.385
So you were weak, coward
and wretched like your father.

01:43:36.418 --> 01:43:41.018
I curse the day
I saved you from the Templars, Yigit.

01:43:46.018 --> 01:43:49.551
I will execute him myself before
my Alps who submitted to me.

01:43:55.485 --> 01:43:56.818
That is enough.

01:43:57.518 --> 01:44:00.851
I want to take to road and take
the rein of my army immediately.

01:44:00.918 --> 01:44:02.251
Be ready. We are going.

01:44:02.885 --> 01:44:05.451
Long live, Sultan!

01:44:05.518 --> 01:44:10.318
Long live, Sultan!

01:44:12.318 --> 01:44:18.151
Long live, Sultan!

01:45:06.551 --> 01:45:08.185
Alps!

01:49:17.818 --> 01:49:18.885
My God.

01:49:21.018 --> 01:49:23.118
Help Ertugrul.

01:49:24.918 --> 01:49:26.851
Do not withhold your help from him.

01:49:29.351 --> 01:49:31.318
Render him victorious on this path.

01:49:35.518 --> 01:49:38.418
Give him strength to save my brother.

01:49:56.418 --> 01:49:58.218
Permission to enter, Gokce Hatun?

01:50:00.985 --> 01:50:02.185
What is it, Bogac Alp?

01:50:02.251 --> 01:50:06.085
Ertugrul Bey and Tugtekin Bey tangled
with each other. We separated hardly them.

01:50:06.151 --> 01:50:08.885
What are you talking about?
Why did they fight?

01:50:08.951 --> 01:50:10.385
We could not understand it.

01:50:11.218 --> 01:50:14.151
-Where is Tugtekin Bey?
-He went to Duru Hatun's grave.

01:50:26.551 --> 01:50:29.418
-Son, is there permission?
-Of course, mother, come in.

01:50:35.218 --> 01:50:36.918
What are you doing?

01:50:36.985 --> 01:50:40.918
I am tired of resting, mother.
We wanted to walk a while with Selcan.

01:50:40.985 --> 01:50:42.085
It would be good.

01:50:44.151 --> 01:50:47.585
What is it? I see you are distressed.
Go ahead, come and sit.

01:51:03.151 --> 01:51:04.385
What is it, mother?

01:51:06.818 --> 01:51:11.485
Last night, Ertugrul and Sungur's
situation saddened me quite much, son.

01:51:12.451 --> 01:51:16.985
They went to raid our most thorny
enemy's den in that state.

01:51:19.285 --> 01:51:21.318
I could not sleep a wink until morning.

01:51:22.885 --> 01:51:25.951
Do not worry, mother.
They will be back unharmed.

01:51:26.351 --> 01:51:30.285
And you know very well, Ertugrul
will always take his own way.

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:35.918
Yesterday, with you,
today, with Sungurtekin.

01:51:36.918 --> 01:51:39.818
I always see discord among my sons.

01:51:43.118 --> 01:51:44.585
What will happen tomorrow?

01:51:45.518 --> 01:51:50.185
When we cast off this trouble,
what kind of trouble will find us?

01:51:52.218 --> 01:51:55.018
Mother. Migration knocks on our door.

01:51:55.851 --> 01:51:59.985
Ertugrul made it clear he may even
turn his back on headquarter's decision.

01:52:01.218 --> 01:52:04.285
He will go to Byzantium border
on his own, if necessary.

01:52:05.785 --> 01:52:07.351
Let's call a spade a spade.

01:52:08.518 --> 01:52:10.451
Time to migrate has come for Kayis.

01:52:11.551 --> 01:52:14.185
If necessary,
Ertugrul will set off alone...

01:52:15.285 --> 01:52:18.385
...and many Alps
will set off with him, too.

01:52:19.418 --> 01:52:21.951
It's better
if you prepare yourself for this.

01:52:24.485 --> 01:52:29.885
And what if the headquarter
decides on going to Byzantium border?

01:52:30.418 --> 01:52:32.851
What will you do then, son?

01:52:32.918 --> 01:52:34.585
Mother, you know me well.

01:52:34.818 --> 01:52:37.551
I have always respected
the headquarter's decisions.

01:52:37.785 --> 01:52:41.218
But I do not think the headquarter
will make such a decision at all.

01:52:41.918 --> 01:52:47.385
Ertugrul will go on this path alone and
he will drag many of our Alps with him.

01:52:51.351 --> 01:52:53.051
You are all Kayi's power, son.

01:52:53.885 --> 01:52:55.185
And its future.

01:52:55.251 --> 01:52:59.218
I am ready to do anything to
keep four of you together.

01:52:59.285 --> 01:53:02.818
We can go to the headquarter,
we can choose a new Bey.

01:53:02.885 --> 01:53:07.251
The others will comply with whoever
will be chosen Bey at the headquarter.

01:53:10.918 --> 01:53:11.918
Mother.

01:53:13.118 --> 01:53:14.985
Do not think of these now.

01:53:15.051 --> 01:53:17.918
Everything finds its own right path.

01:53:18.418 --> 01:53:21.851
Among all these trouble.
Let's walk a little.

01:53:21.918 --> 01:53:26.185
Let's visit my uncle and
Aunt Duru's grave and pray. Huh?

01:56:40.585 --> 01:56:41.885
Where is Ertugrul?

01:56:44.485 --> 01:56:46.085
Tugtekin Bey!

01:56:48.851 --> 01:56:49.951
Bey!

01:56:53.051 --> 01:56:54.385
Where are you, Bey?

01:56:58.785 --> 01:57:01.785
Do not waste your breath
in vain, Fiery Dame.

01:57:02.351 --> 01:57:04.485
Fiery Boy went to the den to kill me.

01:57:09.018 --> 01:57:13.285
-But he will be a prey like you.
-What are you talking about?

01:57:14.118 --> 01:57:17.885
The last I saw you, you were begging
to Ertugrul like a wretched lover.

01:57:18.351 --> 01:57:19.851
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

01:57:19.918 --> 01:57:22.385
What are you doing here?
We are swarmed with enemies.

01:57:22.451 --> 01:57:24.351
I could not accept you leaving.

01:57:25.051 --> 01:57:26.818
So, her name is Gokce.

01:57:31.585 --> 01:57:33.351
You were a covetous dame.

01:57:34.351 --> 01:57:37.018
You somehow managed
to become a Bey's wife.

01:57:37.418 --> 01:57:40.018
You enchanted that Fiery Boy of ours.

01:57:42.785 --> 01:57:44.885
And I will take
his head off, thanks to you.

01:57:45.785 --> 01:57:47.151
What do you want from me?

01:57:49.151 --> 01:57:54.251
Not you, I want Fiery Boy. Your husband.

01:57:58.185 --> 01:58:00.518
Let's see how much he wants you.

02:00:21.251 --> 02:00:22.585
Help me!

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:26.118
Help me!

02:00:33.218 --> 02:00:35.351
I should have been
with my brothers, mother.

02:00:35.418 --> 02:00:37.085
I should have fought with them.

02:00:38.285 --> 02:00:41.485
Its time will come, too, son.
You are an Alp now.

02:00:42.118 --> 02:00:43.918
Ertugrul Brother is making a mistake.

02:00:43.985 --> 02:00:47.951
Yigit betrayed us all.
He is a traitor as Sungurtekin said.

02:00:48.018 --> 02:00:51.318
And not only us, he betrayed
to the state, to our Sultan.

02:00:52.185 --> 02:00:53.951
I will not forgive him all my life.

02:00:54.518 --> 02:00:55.818
What does my mother say?

02:00:56.351 --> 02:00:58.585
She is trying for
the two groups not divide...

02:00:58.818 --> 02:01:00.951
...but it will be hard with my brother.

02:01:12.518 --> 02:01:13.518
What is it?

02:01:14.918 --> 02:01:15.951
This has blood on it.

02:01:20.085 --> 02:01:21.085
Bey.

02:01:25.485 --> 02:01:28.018
They hid them behind the trees, Bey.

02:01:34.018 --> 02:01:35.218
Mother.

02:01:35.285 --> 02:01:36.985
This place is not safe.

02:01:37.051 --> 02:01:38.885
We should go back immediately.

02:01:40.585 --> 02:01:43.851
Dundar, go to the nomad tent
and gather the Alps here. Quick.

02:01:48.318 --> 02:01:50.285
Do you think it's Noyan's doing?

02:01:50.351 --> 02:01:52.985
Who else would do this vagary, mother?

02:01:53.051 --> 02:01:54.351
Help me!

02:01:55.118 --> 02:01:56.851
Gokce!

02:01:56.918 --> 02:01:58.185
-Gokce!
-Hatun!

02:01:58.785 --> 02:02:00.951
-Gokce!
-Selcan, stop!

02:02:04.018 --> 02:02:05.518
Selcan!

02:02:07.151 --> 02:02:08.318
Help me!

02:02:10.251 --> 02:02:11.251
Help!

02:02:17.151 --> 02:02:18.785
Help me!

02:03:59.251 --> 02:04:00.551
Gokce!

02:04:06.318 --> 02:04:07.885
Gokce!

02:04:08.885 --> 02:04:09.885
Hatun!

02:04:11.051 --> 02:04:12.118
Hatun!

02:04:18.451 --> 02:04:19.985
Selcan, stop!

02:04:20.051 --> 02:04:21.351
Gokce!

02:04:24.218 --> 02:04:25.218
Selcan!

02:04:25.851 --> 02:04:26.918
Gokce!

02:05:01.985 --> 02:05:03.151
I have had enough of you!

02:05:04.585 --> 02:05:06.085
Get her on my horse.

02:06:43.318 --> 02:06:44.585
To the den!

02:07:27.418 --> 02:07:28.418
Gokce!

02:07:38.085 --> 02:07:40.318
Would you believe?
We met again, Selcan Hatun.

02:07:41.051 --> 02:07:42.051
Let my sister go!

02:07:43.285 --> 02:07:44.818
You are a vixen as always.

02:07:45.818 --> 02:07:47.251
However, I need your sister.

02:07:54.018 --> 02:07:55.051
Would you believe?

02:07:58.318 --> 02:07:59.585
Everyone is here.

02:08:14.318 --> 02:08:15.351
Noyan!

02:09:21.085 --> 02:09:23.818
Check everywhere.
They might have left a trace.

02:09:39.185 --> 02:09:40.551
They cleared the den.

02:09:41.585 --> 02:09:42.585
Be careful.

02:09:43.418 --> 02:09:45.351
They might have set other traps, too.

02:09:45.418 --> 02:09:48.251
That Noyan dog did not
have the courage to combat.

02:10:13.951 --> 02:10:15.051
Bey!

02:10:33.951 --> 02:10:34.985
It's Gokce's dress.

02:10:38.518 --> 02:10:40.185
There is a letter on it.

02:10:44.118 --> 02:10:45.585
What does it say?

02:10:54.285 --> 02:10:55.318
What does it say?

02:10:58.985 --> 02:11:00.318
Fiery Boy...

02:11:01.318 --> 02:11:03.218
...while you were dwelling at my den...

02:11:04.785 --> 02:11:06.318
...your wife fell prey to me.

02:11:09.885 --> 02:11:12.018
The war is starting now.
