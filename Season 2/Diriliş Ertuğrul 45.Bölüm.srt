00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 45 will start after 12:26 min.

12:26.695 --> 12:30.695
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:32.053 --> 12:35.553
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:35.945 --> 12:38.945
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:57.119 --> 13:01.719
For my God, flag and sword.

13:02.819 --> 13:05.685
Thank God, I am one of those
who are appointed for the duty.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.619
If I go back from this journey...

13:08.785 --> 13:11.019
...that I have for the
sons of my ancestor Oghuz...

13:11.319 --> 13:13.819
...let me be harvested with my own
black steel sword as immature harvest.

13:14.485 --> 13:17.985
Let the blue sky split off.
Let the dark ground be pierced.

13:18.852 --> 13:22.952
Let my Oghuz father and blessed
pavilion to be sue me in afterlife.

13:24.085 --> 13:26.752
Let Hizir Ata be my friend...

13:26.885 --> 13:29.619
...and Prophet Ali my sage
in the way to the holy war.

13:30.452 --> 13:33.452
Let the journey to be ours
and the victory to Gods.

13:46.452 --> 13:48.085
It is time to shear these sheep.

13:48.918 --> 13:51.052
Wool is needed in the carpet store.

13:53.652 --> 13:55.085
Help with it, Shepherd Mustafa.

13:55.652 --> 13:57.819
-With pleasure, Hanim.
-Thank you.

14:01.885 --> 14:05.752
Let us see about what  Goncagul Hatun
takes responsibility again.

14:07.019 --> 14:09.719
It is not easy to be a
Hanim to a Bey, Gundogdu Bey.

14:10.452 --> 14:13.685
You will try to help in every work
so the pavilion may have peace.

14:14.119 --> 14:17.452
What beautiful words
come from your mouth.

14:19.385 --> 14:23.652
I say, at dinner time, let us
talk to speed up the wedding issue.

14:25.452 --> 14:29.019
The girl's house is the coquetry
house. Pander to our whims a bit.

14:30.585 --> 14:31.585
Thank you.

14:34.085 --> 14:35.652
Bey!

14:38.319 --> 14:39.519
There is an issue.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.352
Alright, you can go.

14:50.552 --> 14:52.419
Is there an important issue, Bey?

14:53.019 --> 14:55.919
Hamza escaped from the trussed tent.

14:56.585 --> 14:57.719
Oh My God!

14:58.652 --> 15:01.919
-What will happen now? What will you do?
-Do not worry about it.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.919
Of course, there is
something that I know.

15:25.452 --> 15:28.619
Too much blood spilled for the
seal of Oghuz Kagan, Aytolun.

15:30.452 --> 15:34.785
It seems that there
will be more blood.

15:36.652 --> 15:38.519
What I really wonder is...

15:39.052 --> 15:42.685
...where this seal
comes to Sungurtekin.

15:45.652 --> 15:49.619
Sadettin Kobek knows
that he has the seal...

15:52.119 --> 15:54.452
...the seal must
have come from Konya.

15:55.419 --> 15:58.419
-From the palace?
-Yes, from the palace.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.785
From the hand of Sultan Aleaddin.

16:06.419 --> 16:09.852
Sultan Aleaddin must have given
the seal to Sungurtekin personally.

16:13.385 --> 16:16.819
When Sadettin Kobek learned that
Sungurtekin returned to the nomad tent...

16:17.919 --> 16:20.452
...he asked you to
take the seal from him.

16:24.085 --> 16:29.585
If Sultan is on one side and
Sadettin Kobek is on the other...

16:33.019 --> 16:35.352
...you should be
very careful, brother.

16:46.752 --> 16:49.352
Hamza escaped from his trussed tent.

16:52.619 --> 16:54.819
-How did he escape?
-I do not know.

16:56.552 --> 16:58.585
His news just came to Gundogdu.

17:17.919 --> 17:18.919
Bey.

17:20.385 --> 17:21.852
You know that we will die for you.

17:23.119 --> 17:24.419
You know that...

17:24.952 --> 17:28.385
If you excuse me, Bey
we wonder where we go.

17:29.652 --> 17:31.085
Yes, Bey, we wonder.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.785
We cannot eat out of curiosity.

17:43.352 --> 17:46.419
We are on the way from Otuken and we
travel from land to land, brothers.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.685
Our only concern...

17:51.052 --> 17:55.419
...is a homeland where our nomad
group, ancestry will find peace.

17:59.352 --> 18:01.319
The journey is ours
and the victory is Gods.

18:05.619 --> 18:09.485
There is no meal for those
who are not on the way...

18:10.552 --> 18:12.919
...do not hunt and do
not look for the meal.

18:17.485 --> 18:19.552
I hope we will find
what we are looking for.

18:20.385 --> 18:22.352
If God permits, Bey, thank you.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.052
-Thank you, Bey.
-Thank you, Bey.

18:27.785 --> 18:29.052
What are we looking for, Bey?

18:32.485 --> 18:35.519
It is a homeland that we will
breathe justice and liberty, Turgut.

18:39.552 --> 18:45.885
A homeland that we engrave
our tradition, soul and case.

18:51.585 --> 18:54.119
The crazy little
horses inside me say...

18:55.519 --> 19:00.019
...that this journey will not be like
the other journeys we had until now.

19:04.352 --> 19:09.919
We will ride our horses for the
future of our nomad group and ancestry.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.952
We will continue from the
lands where the sun rises and...

19:16.085 --> 19:19.119
...to the lands where the sun sets.

19:23.019 --> 19:25.052
Did you say the lands
where the sun sets, Bey?

19:30.085 --> 19:34.819
The lands where the
Byzantines and Crusaders rule.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.452
God is almighty.

19:48.552 --> 19:49.785
Peace be upon you.

19:50.052 --> 19:51.885
-And peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

20:10.385 --> 20:13.352
Never again! Brother, where
did you come from again?

20:13.885 --> 20:16.119
Do not care about who showed up
but care about who made him show up...

20:16.385 --> 20:19.352
...do not care about who came
but care about who sent him, brother.

20:23.452 --> 20:25.885
May God be with the one
who came and who sent.

20:34.085 --> 20:36.785
I brought you food so you
would not be hungry on the way.

20:38.085 --> 20:39.952
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

20:48.485 --> 20:49.985
Good appetite, brothers.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.552
Eat slowly you bear, it
will stick in your throat.

20:56.485 --> 20:57.885
Mind your own business!

20:58.785 --> 21:02.819
You had a handful of brain and
you fell in love and lost it too.

21:10.452 --> 21:13.852
Bey, if you excuse me I
would like to come with you.

21:32.352 --> 21:33.852
The wedding day approached, mother.

21:37.052 --> 21:38.852
Your marquee will have full of joy.

21:40.919 --> 21:43.685
Your son, Tugtekin will make your
descend to continue, God willing.

21:45.085 --> 21:46.085
Tugtekin Bey.

21:50.719 --> 21:51.719
Tell me, Bogac.

21:52.119 --> 21:53.319
Bey...

21:54.519 --> 21:56.552
-...Hamza escaped.
-What are you saying, Bogac?

21:57.452 --> 21:58.552
How could that happen?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.019
I do not know, Bey.

22:02.485 --> 22:03.585
Confound it!

22:03.985 --> 22:05.685
Kayis made what they
wanted to do again.

22:06.985 --> 22:09.019
They made nomad tent where
passengers frequently stop by. Walk.

22:14.119 --> 22:19.052
Why did not you say that you will abduct
Hamza and send him to Noyan's place...

22:19.685 --> 22:21.752
...as a spy to my brother Ertugrul?

22:22.852 --> 22:26.852
Sungur. Ertugrul brother
has a secret duty...

22:27.319 --> 22:30.019
...that he did not
tell me or my mother.

22:30.919 --> 22:32.452
I did not want to prevent him.

22:33.419 --> 22:36.819
That is why I decided
to paddle my own canoe.

22:37.785 --> 22:39.952
And I send Wild Dumrul
to follow Efrasiyab.

22:44.652 --> 22:48.719
-Does Korkut Bey know what happened?
-It is just around the corner.

22:56.485 --> 22:59.552
-Korkut Bey came, Mother Hayme.
-Send him in.

23:11.919 --> 23:13.619
How can Hamza escape, Gundogdu?

23:14.952 --> 23:17.952
He betrayed you and put you
in a difficult situation.

23:18.419 --> 23:22.052
But how could he escape
after we caught him?

23:22.685 --> 23:24.985
I do not go to bed with
the snake twice, uncle.

23:25.852 --> 23:30.319
Know that Hamza did not
escape. I let him to escape.

23:34.852 --> 23:38.352
I will send Alps after Hamza now.

23:39.885 --> 23:43.385
I want everybody, except those who
are here, to know that he escaped.

23:50.685 --> 23:52.085
What is this situation,
Gundogdu brother?

23:52.785 --> 23:54.885
Nomad tent became a place where
passengers frequently stop by.

23:55.952 --> 23:58.419
-Let us have a seat.
-Is it time to sit, Mother?

24:00.419 --> 24:02.785
We found and brought the traitor
who raised difficulties...

24:02.985 --> 24:04.952
...for our nomad group
and now he escaped.

24:05.419 --> 24:08.352
Have a seat, furious
man. Let us talk first.

24:08.919 --> 24:10.352
Have a seat.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.019
We are quite far away
from the nomad tent.

25:56.352 --> 25:57.552
Let us get Hamza out.

26:31.685 --> 26:33.452
You did a great job, Efrasiyab.

26:34.419 --> 26:37.019
Noyan does not leave any
favor without giving an award.

26:37.652 --> 26:39.719
-Thank you.
-It was not easy.

26:40.852 --> 26:45.019
Stupid Gundogdu meddled with it.
He went round but...

26:45.919 --> 26:49.585
...I got both of you out from
the nomad group as Noyan asked.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.819
Traitor!

27:37.685 --> 27:40.752
This cur was also a traitor like you.

27:41.385 --> 27:44.852
How could you do this to your tribe,
nomad group, tradition? How could you?

27:45.785 --> 27:49.452
You all will come to grief, you all!

27:49.719 --> 27:51.885
Traitors!

28:36.552 --> 28:38.652
Traitors!

28:39.885 --> 28:41.752
Traitor!

28:41.952 --> 28:45.085
You all will come
to grief as Kocabash.

28:45.685 --> 28:47.719
Traitors!

29:05.052 --> 29:06.452
Look who I brought.

29:10.385 --> 29:11.485
Dumrul.

29:22.885 --> 29:24.919
You hide your skills from us...

29:25.652 --> 29:28.085
...you escaped from
the nomad tent, Hamza.

29:32.752 --> 29:37.852
You talk like you do not know what
Noyan can do for his soldiers, Tangut.

29:39.485 --> 29:41.919
The skill is not mine, it is Noyan's.

29:47.385 --> 29:48.385
Tie them.

29:54.685 --> 29:58.052
Devils. Demon!

30:23.385 --> 30:24.385
Turali Alp.

30:25.619 --> 30:28.485
I think it is time for to be a man.

30:28.885 --> 30:29.985
What do you mean?

30:34.552 --> 30:37.652
If I will be a man that way,
I would accept it with pleasure, master.

30:38.719 --> 30:40.719
Well done, good for you.

30:43.519 --> 30:44.619
Halime Sultan.

30:47.985 --> 30:48.985
I hope nothing is wrong.

30:50.319 --> 30:52.685
Ertugrul Bey left. I
feel bored, Wild Demir.

30:56.685 --> 30:59.052
Do not worry about
Bey, Halime Sultan.

30:59.819 --> 31:02.619
-He will come back, with God's help.
-If God permits!

31:05.919 --> 31:07.485
Turali, what is this face?

31:09.952 --> 31:14.052
-The issue is big, Halime Sultan.
-What is this issue?

31:17.885 --> 31:19.585
It is a shame, I cannot tell.

31:22.419 --> 31:28.419
Halime Sultan, you do your own
business and we have something to do.

31:28.685 --> 31:30.085
All right, more power to you.

31:38.852 --> 31:39.852
Selcan.

31:56.685 --> 31:57.985
Gokce Hatun.

32:01.752 --> 32:03.985
Did you come to this tent because
you remembered your sister?

32:05.519 --> 32:07.819
Since when do you protect my sister?

32:09.852 --> 32:11.352
What are you doing in
my sister's marquee?

32:13.385 --> 32:15.319
We had something to
do with SelcanHatun.

32:16.119 --> 32:18.019
-When I could not find her anywhere...
-Do not you know...

32:18.452 --> 32:22.419
...that she is temperamental?
Who knows what she is after?

32:24.085 --> 32:25.619
She is your sister, Gokce.

32:27.852 --> 32:30.485
Do not turn your back on her
when she needs you the most.

32:32.019 --> 32:36.685
-She needs her beloved ones behind her.
-Where was she when I needed her?

32:39.119 --> 32:40.519
Do you know that?

32:42.052 --> 32:45.052
Do you know that how
she walked over me...

32:45.419 --> 32:49.785
...to became a wife of Bey
and sit in the tent, Halime?

32:56.119 --> 32:57.419
You tell me first.

32:58.752 --> 33:00.052
What were you supposed
to do with my sister?

33:07.752 --> 33:13.452
Or do you want to do that
my sister could not do once?

33:14.585 --> 33:17.619
Do you want to be the
wife of the marquee...

33:17.919 --> 33:21.685
...and sway like you put on airs?

33:21.752 --> 33:23.752
-Know your place, Gokce.
-What if I do not?

33:27.719 --> 33:30.352
Do you think that I do not
know what you are doing?

33:30.752 --> 33:34.752
You put a dagger on my throat in
my hardest, most desperate day.

33:37.519 --> 33:41.019
You bandied about Ertugrul Bey's
words from one marquee to the other.

33:41.919 --> 33:43.919
Mother Hayme was
like a mother to you.

33:44.985 --> 33:47.619
She did not keep you separated
from her own children.

33:49.452 --> 33:52.652
She put up with your bad manners
because of what happened to your father.

33:53.752 --> 33:56.852
But I am neither your
mother nor your sister.

33:59.052 --> 34:02.985
If you do one more mistake,
I will not forgive you.

34:18.885 --> 34:22.819
Vanguard of Noyan was
dispersed by the raid we made.

34:23.952 --> 34:28.085
It is possible that Noyan
asked for a reinforcing unit.

34:30.852 --> 34:34.019
It is true that the bigger
attacks are waiting for us.

34:35.019 --> 34:36.452
You are right, uncle.

34:37.052 --> 34:40.052
After that he will
attack more harshly.

34:42.019 --> 34:45.419
He will try to drive us from
these places by harassing us.

34:46.619 --> 34:47.885
His reputation is shaken.

34:50.819 --> 34:55.752
A person is defeated to his
own anger, not to a great army.

34:57.819 --> 35:00.519
The weakness of such
man is their anger.

35:01.719 --> 35:04.952
It is necessary to
excite his anger more.

35:08.519 --> 35:10.685
Turkmen nomad groups
that he overrode...

35:10.919 --> 35:14.019
...and also the non-Muslim
community of our Sultan...

35:15.052 --> 35:17.885
...heard about the defeat
that we caused to Noyan.

35:19.485 --> 35:23.452
The news about what we've done to Noyan's
curs has reached all the way to Konya.

35:24.985 --> 35:26.585
People are very happy.

35:27.519 --> 35:30.819
Fear of Mongolian left
its place for hope.

35:31.852 --> 35:32.952
Thank God.

35:34.652 --> 35:38.685
Noyan will do anything
to extinguish this hope.

35:42.119 --> 35:43.819
You are right, Gumustekin Bey.

35:44.719 --> 35:48.419
So; for this reason, while Noyan's
wound is still fresh...

35:49.085 --> 35:54.985
...I want to beat him in his
den without we lose any more men.

35:56.752 --> 36:01.385
Hamza gave me this opportunity. He will
learn where the cantonment of Noyan is.

36:02.819 --> 36:06.752
He will complete Abdurrahman's
unfinished blessed job.

36:08.785 --> 36:10.485
I agree with all of what you said.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.819
But at least you could
tell this to us Gundogdu Bey.

36:15.885 --> 36:18.985
Cousin, the Alp is my Alp.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.419
And the duty is my duty.

36:22.585 --> 36:24.852
I had to make an urgent
decision and I did it.

36:25.819 --> 36:27.785
Both the sin and good dead are on me.

36:31.485 --> 36:32.652
You thought right.

36:33.085 --> 36:37.685
But I hope that Hamza
will not betray you again.

36:38.819 --> 36:42.385
Uncle, let Hamza betray me again.

36:43.119 --> 36:45.485
At least we know who the traitor is.

36:46.385 --> 36:48.685
He will not stab us in
the back like Kocabash.

37:56.856 --> 38:00.456
You attack to an injured man like a dog,
he must scare you a lot.

38:01.223 --> 38:03.723
-What is your problem?
-This is not your business, Turkmen.

38:05.423 --> 38:06.723
Kill him!

39:54.789 --> 39:57.489
Tell me brother,
what do they want from you?

40:15.123 --> 40:16.356
Do you not still trust us?

40:25.123 --> 40:26.123
Help me.

40:28.189 --> 40:29.456
They will kill them all.

40:33.056 --> 40:38.289
My sheik, dervishes,
they will threat them all.

40:41.123 --> 40:43.889
-For God's sake, please help.
-Who are they?

40:45.156 --> 40:46.323
Why will they kill?

40:47.456 --> 40:48.823
Tell me who are you?

40:51.056 --> 40:52.189
They call me Ahi Evran.

40:54.156 --> 40:55.223
I am a profession expert.

41:00.323 --> 41:03.056
We were traveling with my master Kirmani.

41:04.423 --> 41:08.523
I remained behind in order to deliver
a consignation to somebody.

41:10.089 --> 41:11.289
My sheik is on the road.

41:12.889 --> 41:16.523
Other part of these cruel
will kill him, too.

41:19.089 --> 41:20.089
Who are they?

41:20.423 --> 41:22.223
You know that they are cruel,
it is enough.

41:27.356 --> 41:30.856
For God's sake! My sheik
is in shelter ahead.

41:32.189 --> 41:34.456
We should catch him, brothers.

41:38.456 --> 41:39.489
Come along Alps!

41:41.089 --> 41:42.089
To the horses!

43:48.489 --> 43:50.989
They say Sadettin Kopek
put someone on our tail.

43:53.023 --> 43:58.023
Enemy never stops cheating,
we never stop being true.

43:58.956 --> 44:03.789
Instead of speaking about cheating of
enemy, we should talk about truth, sons.

44:06.856 --> 44:11.489
Now, immediately we should
get organized in each city.

44:12.923 --> 44:17.289
If we do not improve lands
by science and economy...

44:18.123 --> 44:20.389
...we cannot make this place our home.

44:21.356 --> 44:23.789
We need men from all professions.

44:24.256 --> 44:28.456
Each product we produce
will carry our stamp.

44:29.323 --> 44:32.089
Each product is honor of his maker.

44:32.756 --> 44:39.089
So, we need to raise a group of tradesmen
that are not doing any cheating.

44:40.456 --> 44:43.823
This is the only way we can
get rid of dead soil on us.

44:45.389 --> 44:50.489
We work hard and gain much,
we only use it for favor.

44:51.289 --> 44:55.823
Do not forget sons, we will be
givers, not receivers.

44:59.956 --> 45:01.356
Come along. Help yourself.

45:55.456 --> 45:56.956
Nobody is here.

45:58.523 --> 45:59.723
Be careful.

46:05.323 --> 46:06.389
This way.

46:46.289 --> 46:50.023
From now on, your tongue and body
will be useless.

46:50.423 --> 46:53.489
Your eyes will work,
they will only see our victory.

47:17.089 --> 47:18.123
Master!

47:21.756 --> 47:22.956
Take care of wounded ones!

47:28.123 --> 47:30.089
Master! Thanks to God.

47:31.323 --> 47:33.189
We still have breathes to take, son.

47:35.156 --> 47:37.123
Who are these valiants
that we owe our lives?

47:38.323 --> 47:40.823
I am from Kayi tribe, Ertugrul,
son of Suleyman Shah.

47:45.156 --> 47:49.489
-Who are you?
-I am from Kayseri region, Kirmani.

48:55.823 --> 48:56.989
Tell me.

49:05.023 --> 49:08.256
-Who is this?
-Selcan, wife of Gundogdu.

49:09.889 --> 49:13.156
Are you trying to sell me the woman
that Gundogdu abandoned?

49:14.856 --> 49:17.023
Noyan, Gundogdu will not leave her.

49:24.956 --> 49:29.923
If Gundogdu will not come for her,
I will feed my dogs with you.

49:41.456 --> 49:46.989
I hope your cave will collapse on you.
Are you Noyan, Mongolian cur?

49:55.256 --> 49:58.189
This is not Kayi nomad group
that you rule.

50:08.089 --> 50:09.256
Take this treacherous away!

50:11.189 --> 50:12.823
Let me go!

50:13.923 --> 50:14.923
Let me go!

50:21.889 --> 50:22.989
Dishonest!

50:32.056 --> 50:35.256
You were asking about Hamza, Noyan.
Look, I brought him too.

50:45.723 --> 50:47.789
Come here my loyal Alp.

51:00.789 --> 51:03.256
Hamza, how fool you, Turks, are?

51:05.023 --> 51:08.256
Anyone can escape from your nomad group.

51:09.089 --> 51:12.289
First Abdurrahman, now you.

51:14.256 --> 51:16.023
Who will be tomorrow, we will see.

51:23.356 --> 51:26.056
Why do you think I fight for you, Tangut?

51:29.156 --> 51:33.056
Then escaping was not hard
for you at all, Hamza.

51:41.389 --> 51:42.789
Tell me Hamza.

51:44.223 --> 51:46.489
How you escaped, I wonder.

51:56.723 --> 51:57.989
I sold out Efrasiyab.

52:00.856 --> 52:02.923
I told Gundogdu that
Efrasiyab is a traitor.

52:12.389 --> 52:17.123
I said I am ashamed of what I have done
to my nomad group, I feel guilty.

52:22.989 --> 52:25.956
I said give me a last chance so that
I can bring head of Noyan to you.

52:32.256 --> 52:33.889
Gundogdu believed me like a fool.

52:39.723 --> 52:41.856
Now he waits for your head with all eyes.

52:42.989 --> 52:44.389
Well done Hamza.

52:48.423 --> 52:51.823
You did what was expected
from you. Well done.

53:03.856 --> 53:06.723
Look at that woman. I would not
wish it on worst enemy.

53:09.156 --> 53:10.856
Even devil may fear of her.

53:16.256 --> 53:18.256
I also have a gift for you, Noyan.

53:19.856 --> 53:21.023
Above all.

53:44.523 --> 53:46.156
He is cur of Gundogdu.

53:48.789 --> 53:51.089
He put him on tail of Efrasiyab.

53:57.023 --> 54:03.123
So smart boy Gundogdu did not trust
you and put him on tail of Efrasiyab.

54:34.256 --> 54:38.389
Dervish, give it to someone
to pick up fresh ones.

54:38.456 --> 54:40.756
-Thank you, Artuk Bey.
-Go now.

55:06.856 --> 55:09.089
-Welcome, Bey.
-Thank you, Artuk Bey.

55:10.156 --> 55:12.756
How is your health? I hope you are good.

55:13.356 --> 55:16.423
It is good Artuk Bey.
Thank to you I got over it.

55:17.923 --> 55:20.189
-You saved my life.
-It does not matter, Bey.

55:20.923 --> 55:22.189
We have not done anything.

55:22.723 --> 55:26.156
It is God gave you health,
we just delivered it.

55:26.856 --> 55:29.823
So you have more days to see, Bey.

55:30.389 --> 55:32.489
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

55:37.923 --> 55:40.223
Ertugrul told me about you
before he left.

55:41.123 --> 55:45.789
He said you know all the conditions.
He said you can trust to Artuk Bey.

55:46.823 --> 55:48.056
Thank you, Bey.

55:50.056 --> 55:51.989
We lost enough time.

55:52.989 --> 55:56.956
I want to be on road for my duty.

55:58.923 --> 56:01.323
I informed white-bearded
about conditions, Bey.

56:01.423 --> 56:03.423
After healing, we can be on road.

56:04.423 --> 56:07.089
They wait for you with
seal of Oghuz Khan.

56:09.323 --> 56:13.856
-Then, we go to road by tomorrow.
-As you wish, Bey.

57:04.389 --> 57:05.823
Cur of Gundogdu!

57:26.389 --> 57:27.856
You are a lucky man!

57:45.023 --> 57:49.789
I would separate your head from
your body but you are auspicious.

58:11.423 --> 58:13.023
What are you thinking, Noyan?

58:14.989 --> 58:18.923
So Gundogdu declared war against us,
we will give response to him!

58:21.289 --> 58:22.856
Now, listen to me carefully!

58:25.056 --> 58:28.523
Listen, so that you go and
tell Gundogdu what I said!

58:47.789 --> 58:49.289
Oh Selcan Hatun, oh!

58:50.723 --> 58:52.023
Where are you again?

59:10.123 --> 59:11.756
Who are the ones that ambushed you?

59:12.289 --> 59:15.856
While human is in the right way
there are many devils after him, son.

59:16.823 --> 59:18.989
Just a devil tried to trip us.

59:20.189 --> 59:22.523
Like I might be afraid of death
as an old man.

59:25.489 --> 59:27.089
Why did they want to kill you?

59:27.923 --> 59:29.723
Because son, by killing us...

59:29.856 --> 59:33.323
...they want to destroy Turkish-islamic
guild we formed in Anatolia.

59:38.889 --> 59:40.823
I have never heard of
this organization before.

59:41.123 --> 59:42.289
What is your duty?

59:44.189 --> 59:46.923
Our purpose is to raise good tradesmen...

59:47.089 --> 59:49.089
...that will bring halal income
to these lands.

59:50.723 --> 59:55.489
I completed my duty. I have been
living in Kayseri for years.

59:56.356 --> 59:59.723
Now, I am going back to Baghdad,
place I born.

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:04.989
I put my groom, Ahi Evran
to head of this organization.

01:00:06.356 --> 01:00:09.089
From now on, it will be mentioned
with his name.

01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:17.189
What is your purpose exactly?

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:22.256
Son, if you do not develop places...

01:00:22.323 --> 01:00:25.323
...you gained with good tradesmen...

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.756
...it means this Turkish-Islamic guild
remains incomplete.

01:00:28.823 --> 01:00:33.123
Unfortunately while we were kept away
from trade, occupational activities...

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:37.889
...cruel that got into it
had good profits.

01:00:39.989 --> 01:00:44.256
They want to control people with lucre
that they cannot beat with sword.

01:00:46.856 --> 01:00:49.889
How someone can beat someone with lucre
that cannot be beaten by sword, Bey?

01:00:51.723 --> 01:00:53.189
My dear young sons.

01:00:54.156 --> 01:00:58.156
They make it very well
and you cannot even notice it.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:06.389
If a nation cannot raise its own traders
masters, they will always be lowly.

01:01:07.523 --> 01:01:13.389
So, sons of this nation will work hard,
gain much and compete with each other.

01:01:17.523 --> 01:01:22.923
But master, why does someone
fight for a lucre?

01:01:23.389 --> 01:01:25.756
Eventually, this is an ephemeral world.

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:31.156
My dear son, is not it the idea
that makes us lowly?

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:37.023
We cannot say it is transitory life
and remain out of trading and be lazy.

01:01:37.856 --> 01:01:39.056
Never!

01:01:40.023 --> 01:01:45.156
First of all, was not our Prophet,
our guide a tradesman?

01:01:46.423 --> 01:01:49.389
He raised within trading
since his childhood.

01:01:50.389 --> 01:01:53.989
He worked for his halal food
in many caravans.

01:01:55.456 --> 01:01:59.856
We will earn, yes, but we will not be
slave of what we earned!

01:02:01.089 --> 01:02:04.889
We will give what we earned to the poor.

01:02:12.123 --> 01:02:13.156
Well said.

01:02:14.456 --> 01:02:15.823
You lightened us.

01:02:19.256 --> 01:02:20.723
We travel everywhere...

01:02:21.123 --> 01:02:23.756
...but we did not effort on
raising our masters...

01:02:23.889 --> 01:02:26.489
...and trading as much as
we did in wars.

01:02:27.956 --> 01:02:29.823
I memorized your words.

01:02:30.923 --> 01:02:33.023
One day if I have a seignior...

01:02:33.356 --> 01:02:36.923
...I will raise many masters and traders.

01:02:38.523 --> 01:02:40.089
Thank you, valiant man.

01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:43.223
We owe you a life.

01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:48.723
Know that from now on
first my groom Ahi Evran...

01:02:48.956 --> 01:02:52.289
...and all Turkish-Islamic guild
will be with you.

01:02:55.823 --> 01:03:01.456
Know that from now on wherever son of
Suleyman Shah, Ertugrul Bey goes...

01:03:02.223 --> 01:03:04.256
...they will always be with
Turkish-Islamic guild.

01:03:04.889 --> 01:03:05.923
Thank you.

01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:07.789
Thank you.

01:03:49.189 --> 01:03:52.523
It should be a wedding, that looks
good on both Kayi and Dodurga.

01:03:55.456 --> 01:03:58.756
Two marquees will have
two brides and two grooms.

01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:10.923
We need to invite all Beys of
nomad groups that are around us.

01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:15.423
Joy of double wedding should reach
to all tribes of Oghuz.

01:04:15.989 --> 01:04:17.123
What do you say, brother?

01:04:19.056 --> 01:04:22.756
We will do what Beys want
for my unique daughter.

01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:27.523
This is my happiest day.
I have a valiant son like Gundogdu.

01:04:29.323 --> 01:04:31.123
Thank you, Bey, thank you.

01:04:48.956 --> 01:04:53.489
Halime Sultan, you pull a long face.
What is happening?

01:04:56.156 --> 01:04:58.389
I have not seen Selcan Hatun
all day long, Bey.

01:04:59.256 --> 01:05:00.823
I feel worried because of this.

01:05:02.389 --> 01:05:05.789
When I came wounded, I know that
she was always watching me.

01:05:06.223 --> 01:05:09.789
But I have not seen her
since the time I recovered.

01:05:11.889 --> 01:05:15.189
Last time I saw her before dinner.
Then I have not seen her.

01:05:17.156 --> 01:05:18.823
It bothers me, Bey.

01:05:24.856 --> 01:05:28.489
What Tugtekin son and
Gokce daughter say to this?

01:05:33.489 --> 01:05:37.389
How our beys want it,
alright for us Mother Hayme.

01:05:46.856 --> 01:05:48.189
Mother Hayme, with your permission.

01:05:48.489 --> 01:05:51.323
Dumrul Alp arrived.
He wants to see Gundogdu Bey.

01:05:53.323 --> 01:05:54.423
Send him inside.

01:06:13.256 --> 01:06:14.456
-Dumrul!
-Bey.

01:06:15.756 --> 01:06:16.756
What happened?

01:06:18.323 --> 01:06:19.323
Noyan.

01:06:21.723 --> 01:06:22.756
What about Noyan?

01:06:27.923 --> 01:06:30.156
Talk to me, man, what about Noyan?

01:06:31.289 --> 01:06:34.156
Noyan kidnapped Selcan Hatun, bey.

01:06:43.089 --> 01:06:45.989
Dumrul, what are you saying, son?

01:06:46.489 --> 01:06:50.489
How can they kidnap my daughter,
wife of Bey from nomad group?

01:06:52.289 --> 01:06:54.089
Tell me, how did it happen?

01:06:55.156 --> 01:06:59.456
I was following caravan of Efrasiyab.
Tangut caught me.

01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:03.989
They blindfolded me and took me to a cave.

01:07:05.889 --> 01:07:07.956
Selcan Hatun was in caravan too, bey.

01:07:15.056 --> 01:07:20.456
Noyan preferred to send a message
to you, instead of killing my, Bey.

01:07:22.523 --> 01:07:23.789
Send what?

01:07:26.889 --> 01:07:28.356
What message, tell me!

01:07:28.456 --> 01:07:31.389
What does this Noyan centipede
wants from my daughter?

01:07:33.856 --> 01:07:36.123
Noyan wanted me to deliver a message...

01:07:37.489 --> 01:07:40.089
...but only to Gundogdu Bey,
Mother Hayme.

01:07:52.023 --> 01:07:53.156
Come with me!

01:07:59.389 --> 01:08:00.489
Mother.

01:08:01.823 --> 01:08:02.856
Come mother.

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:15.356
Tell me what does cur Noyan want?

01:08:16.089 --> 01:08:20.223
He will come to Gehenna Valley alone
only with Selcan Hatun.

01:08:22.089 --> 01:08:24.223
What does he want from me
as return to Selcan?

01:08:25.323 --> 01:08:27.923
He wants a consignation
that Sungurtekin has.

01:08:28.956 --> 01:08:31.523
-What consignation?
-He did not tell me, Bey.

01:08:32.389 --> 01:08:37.089
He only said that you should take it
and go to Gehenna Valley.

01:08:41.723 --> 01:08:45.723
He told me that if you will not come
alone, he will kill Selcan Hatun.

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:50.189
Do not tell anyone about it, understood?

01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:52.956
Go.

01:09:08.489 --> 01:09:12.123
Son, what does this cur Noyan
want from you?

01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:16.089
He wants a consignation
that Sungurtekin has, mother.

01:09:32.056 --> 01:09:36.356
I have nothing to give to this dishonest
man, except my life, brother.

01:09:37.323 --> 01:09:38.789
<i>Your brother Sungurtekin?</i>

01:09:39.356 --> 01:09:41.923
I know Noyan hates him, bey.

01:09:43.323 --> 01:09:47.156
He trusted him once, helped him
to raise with Ogeday...

01:09:47.323 --> 01:09:50.889
...and then Sungurtekin became
spy of Sultan Aladdin.

01:09:51.389 --> 01:09:53.023
<i>I know Mongolians do not take prisoners.</i>

01:09:53.089 --> 01:09:55.289
How did they take you, Sungurtekin Bey?

01:09:55.789 --> 01:09:57.323
Because I know a lot about horses.

01:09:57.723 --> 01:10:00.189
I watched horses of Genghis Khan
for years.

01:10:01.356 --> 01:10:02.356
Sungur!

01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:24.723
You are like your brother Ertugrul,
Sungur.

01:10:25.256 --> 01:10:28.156
You are like a tree that draws
a thunderbolt in a plain valley.

01:10:29.156 --> 01:10:33.389
You did not terminate suffer
you cause on us on your returns...

01:10:34.256 --> 01:10:36.123
...brought new ones instead.

01:10:38.223 --> 01:10:39.789
-Brother...
-Do not say it!

01:10:41.123 --> 01:10:42.389
Do not say it, Sungur!

01:10:44.789 --> 01:10:45.856
Gundogdu!

01:11:26.823 --> 01:11:31.189
<i>Gundogdu. I was not able to</i>
 <i>be a good wife for you again.</i>

01:11:32.723 --> 01:11:35.823
<i>You were about to find peace</i>
 <i>I caused trouble again.</i>

01:11:36.723 --> 01:11:38.456
<i>I turned your world into black.</i>

01:11:39.756 --> 01:11:42.723
<i>If God permits you give</i>
 <i>your blessing to me, Bey.</i>

01:11:44.289 --> 01:11:46.523
<i>However, death is the best for me.</i>

01:11:47.723 --> 01:11:50.523
<i>A life without you is death to me.</i>

01:12:44.423 --> 01:12:45.989
Oh Selcan!

01:12:48.389 --> 01:12:50.056
Such a bad fate you have.

01:12:53.523 --> 01:12:56.523
You are woman of such great examinations.

01:12:57.923 --> 01:13:00.389
Your existence is trouble,
your absence is grief.

01:13:04.489 --> 01:13:06.389
If something happens to you...

01:14:33.289 --> 01:14:34.423
Snake!

01:14:36.089 --> 01:14:38.089
Do not get close to me.

01:14:38.756 --> 01:14:40.856
I swear, I kill you.

01:15:13.756 --> 01:15:19.889
My favorite two smells,
blood and woman.

01:15:26.256 --> 01:15:27.289
Noyan!

01:15:38.489 --> 01:15:40.789
If it is understood that
you got close to her...

01:15:41.856 --> 01:15:43.423
...Gundogdu will not give you the seal.

01:15:55.156 --> 01:15:56.789
I will not sacrifice you now.

01:15:59.089 --> 01:16:00.456
You still have time.

01:16:03.989 --> 01:16:05.256
Ulubilge!

01:16:44.956 --> 01:16:46.223
Animal!

01:17:31.414 --> 01:17:32.414
Brother.

01:17:34.081 --> 01:17:35.948
Your fire of love just reappeared, right?

01:17:38.248 --> 01:17:40.448
Look at me Bamsi,
if you say one more word!

01:17:41.314 --> 01:17:43.681
What are you going to do brother,
are you going to kick me?

01:17:45.381 --> 01:17:48.414
Brother, in the part you hit,
roses will grow.

01:17:49.914 --> 01:17:53.214
Go on, if you feel
relieved brother, go on.

01:17:57.948 --> 01:18:00.114
Dogan, sit down.

01:18:03.381 --> 01:18:04.414
I said, sit!

01:18:12.714 --> 01:18:13.714
Come.

01:18:15.781 --> 01:18:16.881
Sit here.

01:18:33.214 --> 01:18:35.281
You look like a rotor, fell in a bougie.

01:18:35.714 --> 01:18:37.848
Yes, brother.
Neither rotor nor legs remained.

01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:39.148
Bamsi!

01:18:39.748 --> 01:18:41.348
If I talk again, I am a Mongolian cur.

01:18:44.248 --> 01:18:45.648
Is the matter Banu Cicek?

01:18:53.248 --> 01:18:54.981
-Is it a secret?
-Yes, it is.

01:19:00.314 --> 01:19:01.381
Alright, then.

01:19:02.248 --> 01:19:03.648
Keep your secret to yourself.

01:19:05.948 --> 01:19:07.248
But, talk with us please.

01:19:13.314 --> 01:19:16.081
Look brother, we have a long way.

01:19:20.181 --> 01:19:22.781
But with condition of you,
road will never ends.

01:19:30.148 --> 01:19:31.314
I am sorry brothers.

01:19:41.048 --> 01:19:42.214
Tell us, what happened?

01:19:43.748 --> 01:19:48.014
Banu Cicek have been saying it constantly.

01:19:51.381 --> 01:19:55.714
Fate brought to nomad groups together.

01:20:00.814 --> 01:20:02.314
Means it brought me to Banu Cicek.

01:20:06.214 --> 01:20:07.248
But now...

01:20:11.448 --> 01:20:13.214
What happened? Tell us.

01:20:16.448 --> 01:20:17.448
When I went to see her...

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:21.414
<i>...while my heart expects</i>
 <i>a nice conversation...</i>

01:20:24.381 --> 01:20:26.148
<i>Did Selcan Hatun send you here?</i>

01:20:33.248 --> 01:20:35.381
...my throat felt cold of
her dagger, brothers.

01:20:36.148 --> 01:20:37.148
Come along!

01:20:59.914 --> 01:21:03.148
<i>Each route I go, each range I arrive</i>
 <i>open me new doors.</i>

01:21:04.448 --> 01:21:07.214
<i>Each opened door invites me</i>
 <i>to new adventures.</i>

01:21:08.348 --> 01:21:12.448
<i>Crazy horses, riding within my soul</i>
 <i>big fires burn my heart...</i>

01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:16.448
<i>...tell me, what is at the end</i>
 <i>of this battle?</i>

01:21:17.781 --> 01:21:19.181
<i>Why these pains will be obtunded?</i>

01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:25.881
<i>Ibn-i Arabi, the white-bearded,</i>
 <i>Kirmani and Ahi Evran.</i>

01:21:27.214 --> 01:21:29.748
<i>Why these servants of you meet</i>
 <i>with poor people?</i>

01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:32.914
<i>There must be a reason for sure.</i>

01:21:35.381 --> 01:21:38.681
<i>Dear God, do not leave me to my desire.</i>

01:21:39.681 --> 01:21:41.248
<i>Meet me with your servants.</i>

01:21:42.248 --> 01:21:43.381
<i>Have mercy on me.</i>

01:22:22.214 --> 01:22:27.081
There is no one left in this nomad group
that he has not threated.

01:22:28.714 --> 01:22:32.714
My sons, daughter, myself.

01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:44.014
I will not let it, as Gundogdu does.

01:22:45.748 --> 01:22:51.714
Together we will take care
of this dishonest cur!

01:22:55.148 --> 01:22:58.814
While your nomad group
marquee of your father...

01:22:59.681 --> 01:23:01.381
...face with such a threat like that...

01:23:03.048 --> 01:23:05.014
...you still want to go, Sungurtekin?

01:23:11.448 --> 01:23:14.814
Mother, I want to...

01:23:15.148 --> 01:23:21.014
If you go before head of Noyan
is sticked to pole...

01:23:22.348 --> 01:23:23.881
...I will not give my blessing to you!

01:23:31.748 --> 01:23:32.848
From now on...

01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:36.148
...all people lives in this marquee...

01:23:37.981 --> 01:23:42.414
...member of this nomad group
will dedicate...

01:23:44.714 --> 01:23:47.114
...theirs to the war against Noyan!

01:23:53.848 --> 01:23:55.881
Noyan will die!

01:23:58.214 --> 01:23:59.448
Know it very well...

01:24:00.714 --> 01:24:02.048
...before he dies...

01:24:03.148 --> 01:24:04.681
...we are not foreseen as alive.

01:24:09.948 --> 01:24:15.348
Mother Hayme, people of Dodurga
and Tugtekin will do anything...

01:24:16.848 --> 01:24:19.314
...they can in order to save my sister.

01:24:23.714 --> 01:24:25.248
If God permits you are right, Gokce.

01:24:34.314 --> 01:24:35.648
What are you trying to say?

01:24:37.981 --> 01:24:41.781
God's sake, if something
happens to Selcan...

01:24:42.414 --> 01:24:44.114
I know so many people
that might be happy for it.

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:47.748
Especially in marquee of Korkut Bey.

01:24:52.681 --> 01:24:53.948
Enough!

01:24:56.048 --> 01:24:57.948
Such factiousness is this!

01:24:59.848 --> 01:25:01.914
How can you say it in a day like this?

01:25:07.414 --> 01:25:08.681
Mother!

01:25:09.681 --> 01:25:11.148
Bring your bride into line.

01:25:15.081 --> 01:25:19.248
Do it, if not I will cause an accident.

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:21.048
Enough, shut up now, both of you!

01:25:23.981 --> 01:25:24.981
Shut up!

01:25:39.414 --> 01:25:42.414
Sungurtekin obviously hides
what Noyan wants.

01:25:44.148 --> 01:25:46.781
Even if Sungurtekin gives Noyan
what he wants...

01:25:48.148 --> 01:25:50.214
...after Noyan gets what he wants...

01:25:50.381 --> 01:25:53.848
...he will not let Selcan Hatun
and Gundogdu Bey live.

01:25:56.748 --> 01:25:59.714
We cannot let Gundogdu Bey
come under ambush.

01:26:02.948 --> 01:26:05.648
He should not risk his life
for Selcan Hatun.

01:26:07.881 --> 01:26:11.448
He will go, Gundogdu I know would go.

01:26:14.148 --> 01:26:16.014
We need to prevent it.

01:26:20.114 --> 01:26:24.181
If he decides and do it...

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:27.448
...he will seek help from you.

01:26:29.314 --> 01:26:35.048
Do not destroy you and Goncagul's home
before you have it, son.

01:26:39.681 --> 01:26:44.914
Do not sacrifice yourself
for this ignoble woman.

01:26:47.114 --> 01:26:49.248
Make him change his decision tomorrow.

01:26:52.448 --> 01:26:56.981
Noyan will want to have his reputation
back that he lost with our attack.

01:26:57.881 --> 01:26:59.948
This is the reason why he batted Selcan.

01:27:01.081 --> 01:27:06.148
Do not come under ambush like good hearted
Gundogdu Bey does, Tugtekin.

01:27:09.414 --> 01:27:12.114
I do not want to lose
my son Gundogdu and you.

01:27:16.748 --> 01:27:20.648
This woman was the biggest obstacle
in front of your home, son.

01:27:21.181 --> 01:27:25.248
Do not dare to go.
Let him drown in his own dirt.

01:27:47.281 --> 01:27:49.114
Why Gundogdu has not come still?

01:28:02.981 --> 01:28:04.314
Women, leave us alone.

01:28:05.281 --> 01:28:07.414
I will talk with Sungurtekin and mother.

01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:25.114
Give me consignation Noyan wants, Sungur.

01:28:28.448 --> 01:28:32.181
I will bring you both your consignation
and Selcan sister.

01:28:35.414 --> 01:28:36.748
I cannot do it, brother.

01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:41.781
What does it mean, son?

01:28:43.748 --> 01:28:46.081
Is this consignation more valuable
than your sister...

01:28:46.314 --> 01:28:48.414
...is this the reason you say it?

01:28:54.814 --> 01:28:55.914
I cannot do it, mother.

01:28:58.281 --> 01:28:59.281
It is all.

01:29:03.948 --> 01:29:07.214
If my brother orders,
I go and fight for my sister...

01:29:08.948 --> 01:29:10.114
...give me life for her.

01:29:11.348 --> 01:29:14.148
But do not want what I have.

01:29:20.081 --> 01:29:22.048
Is there a contact with your unwilling...

01:29:23.281 --> 01:29:26.814
...for giving consignation and being
spy of Sultan Aladdin, brother?

01:29:31.748 --> 01:29:33.114
What are you saying, Gundogdu?

01:29:34.448 --> 01:29:35.848
Is it true, Sungurtekin?

01:29:40.014 --> 01:29:41.281
His eyes say it is true, mother.

01:29:45.048 --> 01:29:47.248
So this is a matter of state,
secret of state.

01:29:52.848 --> 01:29:56.214
Grooming horses of Genghis Khan
was not true also, right?

01:30:03.181 --> 01:30:04.948
Where is Ertugrul in this matter?

01:30:09.181 --> 01:30:11.214
Know that both me and Ertugrul...

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:17.114
...will not leave Oghuz Tribe
to Mongolian Curs and Crusader Army!

01:30:19.114 --> 01:30:20.448
There is nothing beyond it!

01:30:21.448 --> 01:30:25.214
Even if you give me this
consignation or not...

01:30:25.381 --> 01:30:27.248
...I will go and save Selcan, Sungur.

01:30:29.981 --> 01:30:34.048
Brother, let me come with you.

01:30:38.181 --> 01:30:40.014
Give this consignation to your brother.

01:30:43.381 --> 01:30:46.214
I cannot leave my daughter
to sword of Noyan.

01:30:47.248 --> 01:30:48.414
Mother.

01:30:50.114 --> 01:30:51.381
Suleyman Shah...

01:30:53.248 --> 01:30:57.148
...never let anybody to death
while he was ruling this marquee.

01:30:59.148 --> 01:31:01.881
I will not abandon as well.
Know it in this way, son.

01:31:07.048 --> 01:31:11.114
Sungur, I swear, I will bring you back...

01:31:11.981 --> 01:31:14.181
...your consignation and your sister.

01:31:15.348 --> 01:31:16.348
Come along.

01:32:21.747 --> 01:32:22.781
It is stolen, brother.

01:32:24.714 --> 01:32:25.848
What are you saying, Sungur?

01:32:26.714 --> 01:32:29.914
When I was wounded, Ertugrul took it
from hands of Noyan.

01:32:30.414 --> 01:32:31.714
Brought it to me.

01:32:32.314 --> 01:32:36.214
Seal was inside of carpetbag.
I hided carpetbeg under my pillow.

01:32:37.881 --> 01:32:39.081
What is happening, mother?

01:32:40.214 --> 01:32:43.348
Who can leak to marquee of Bey
and stole a secret of state?

01:32:44.714 --> 01:32:46.781
Besides, who knows secret of this seal?

01:32:49.381 --> 01:32:50.914
Someone connected with Noyan.

01:32:55.148 --> 01:32:58.081
So have not eradicated
traitors yet, mother.

01:32:58.914 --> 01:33:00.648
They can reach to our marquee even.

01:33:06.114 --> 01:33:10.314
If I find who did this,
I will kill by my own hands.

01:33:12.414 --> 01:33:18.081
As punish as a warning to others,
I will not take body down for months!

01:33:21.714 --> 01:33:24.814
I know that I will go to place
Noyan wants...

01:33:25.781 --> 01:33:27.348
...will take Selcan and kill him.

01:33:29.314 --> 01:33:31.148
Without seal, you cannot
go there, brother.

01:33:33.414 --> 01:33:38.914
Sungur, God's sake brother,
tell me what is this seal?

01:34:11.914 --> 01:34:14.348
-Peace be with you.
-And peace be with you, Bey.

01:34:14.948 --> 01:34:16.814
-Welcome, my Bey.
-Thanks.

01:34:18.981 --> 01:34:21.181
-Is he still unconscious?
-He is unconscious, Bey.

01:34:21.981 --> 01:34:24.281
But he will recover, if God permits.

01:34:25.014 --> 01:34:26.081
If God permits.

01:34:27.214 --> 01:34:29.781
Then we want to take your advice
about one thing, Bey.

01:34:30.381 --> 01:34:31.381
Yes, my Bey.

01:34:31.948 --> 01:34:34.314
We need a seal, can you do it?

01:34:35.981 --> 01:34:37.014
Seal of Oghuz Khan.

01:34:43.948 --> 01:34:46.914
I can do it, but before I do,
I need to see it Bey.

01:34:47.414 --> 01:34:48.914
I cannot do anything without seeing it.

01:34:52.948 --> 01:34:54.681
Artuk Bey, seal is missing.

01:34:58.748 --> 01:34:59.948
I can draw the seal.

01:35:00.781 --> 01:35:03.714
Great, my Bey.
Come along and draw the seal.

01:35:56.348 --> 01:35:58.748
-Welcome, Gokce.
-Thank you, Bey.

01:36:05.214 --> 01:36:07.114
Since last night I could not sleep.

01:36:10.281 --> 01:36:12.181
If something happens to my sister
I will be grieved.

01:36:17.114 --> 01:36:18.748
In spite of everything, she is my sister.

01:36:23.914 --> 01:36:24.914
Tugtekin.

01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:29.114
I am begging you, help saving my sister.

01:36:31.014 --> 01:36:32.714
Do not leave my brother Gundogdu.

01:36:34.348 --> 01:36:35.348
I am begging you.

01:36:37.814 --> 01:36:39.081
We should hope for the best, Gokce.

01:36:40.414 --> 01:36:41.748
We should hope for the best.

01:36:53.248 --> 01:36:55.448
With God's help, I can prepare it
for tomorrow, Bey.

01:36:56.914 --> 01:36:58.681
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

01:37:28.448 --> 01:37:29.748
Which one of you made this food?

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:35.048
This poor one, master.

01:37:37.181 --> 01:37:38.981
You have potential of Ahi-order, son.

01:37:39.848 --> 01:37:41.714
Everybody cannot make donut.

01:37:43.314 --> 01:37:44.381
May God bless you.

01:37:46.781 --> 01:37:48.848
I am good at eating meals, Bey.

01:37:49.781 --> 01:37:51.348
Do I have potential of Ahi-order?

01:37:52.814 --> 01:37:55.881
Bread is the staff of life, son.
Eating is also business of adults.

01:37:59.114 --> 01:38:00.381
Our horses are ready, sheik.

01:38:01.214 --> 01:38:02.948
We can be on the road anytime you want.

01:38:03.881 --> 01:38:05.048
Have a good trip brothers.

01:38:06.214 --> 01:38:07.848
-Have a good trip.
-Have a good trip.

01:38:09.148 --> 01:38:10.914
Come along. We need to be on the road.

01:38:12.414 --> 01:38:13.814
Come on.

01:38:18.648 --> 01:38:19.981
Do not forget to pray for us.

01:38:21.714 --> 01:38:25.048
You got the pray of Ibn Arabi, son.

01:38:26.314 --> 01:38:28.081
All we can do is just to say, amen.

01:38:33.214 --> 01:38:36.348
In the region you go,
there is Mahmut Dervish.

01:38:37.181 --> 01:38:40.081
Your routes will across with him.
He is a dervish with knowledge.

01:38:40.448 --> 01:38:41.881
Share his food.

01:38:42.814 --> 01:38:45.648
You have a long way to go,
always be prepared.

01:38:54.081 --> 01:38:55.681
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:39:21.648 --> 01:39:22.648
Hayme.

01:39:24.281 --> 01:39:27.814
As you also know,
Noyan will not let them live.

01:39:32.181 --> 01:39:37.148
When we assigned Gundogdu Bey
as head of Alps, we trusted him.

01:39:38.681 --> 01:39:41.314
Now, it is time to show it.

01:39:49.981 --> 01:39:51.048
Mother Hayme.

01:39:54.314 --> 01:39:59.348
Without wild one you cannot battle
or take a decision, Beys.

01:40:00.448 --> 01:40:04.081
I came to say, whatever you do,
I contribute.

01:40:08.714 --> 01:40:09.948
Welcome, master.

01:40:12.848 --> 01:40:18.148
Hayme Hatun, we know that Selcan is
like your daughter, as Gokce Hatun.

01:40:20.014 --> 01:40:21.948
Although betray of their father...

01:40:22.948 --> 01:40:26.381
...you raised these two girls...

01:40:27.148 --> 01:40:29.914
...innocent ones with mercy.

01:40:31.881 --> 01:40:34.014
But the matter is not being a mother.

01:40:35.381 --> 01:40:38.214
If something happens to our
head of Alps Gundogdu Bey...

01:40:38.781 --> 01:40:40.181
...both nomad groups will be damaged.

01:40:41.014 --> 01:40:43.448
What are we for, Gumustekin Bey?

01:40:44.848 --> 01:40:46.814
Do you plan to leave him alone?

01:40:49.081 --> 01:40:50.648
Of course we will not.

01:40:51.981 --> 01:40:57.048
But I say, we should send other Alps
instead of Gundogdu Bey.

01:40:59.748 --> 01:41:02.948
They should go with whatever
Noyan wants from Sungurtekin.

01:41:06.681 --> 01:41:09.448
Why Noyan wants specifically Gundogdu Bey?

01:41:14.014 --> 01:41:15.348
Obviously he is into something.

01:41:29.081 --> 01:41:31.281
I will go and take Selcan Hatun
from Noyan.

01:41:34.348 --> 01:41:37.081
I am not going to
leave my wife to a man...

01:41:37.448 --> 01:41:40.281
...that is out of control to leak
him men...

01:41:40.648 --> 01:41:43.314
...to our nomad group and
martyr our girls, women.

01:41:44.648 --> 01:41:46.114
Of course he will pay for it.

01:41:50.014 --> 01:41:54.714
Obviously, you took consignation
that Noyan wants from Sungurtekin.

01:42:07.081 --> 01:42:08.114
Now I am asking...

01:42:09.248 --> 01:42:11.181
...is he going to give you Selcan Hatun...

01:42:11.981 --> 01:42:14.281
...when you give him
what he wants, Gundogdu?

01:42:15.781 --> 01:42:18.048
I do not know if he does it
with his own wish or not.

01:42:19.248 --> 01:42:22.948
But if he does not, I will rip it of
with my teeth if necessary.

01:42:27.148 --> 01:42:29.348
Now, who is with me?

01:42:43.048 --> 01:42:44.114
You also, do not go.

01:42:45.914 --> 01:42:49.181
Noyan does not have his old power,
while we have weakened him...

01:42:49.881 --> 01:42:51.848
...we should send our other Alps.

01:42:53.881 --> 01:42:54.981
What do you say, son?

01:42:55.848 --> 01:42:57.114
Who else is with me?

01:43:04.414 --> 01:43:06.381
We will go and bring Selcan Hatun back,
brother Gundogdu.

01:43:43.414 --> 01:43:44.648
Are you ready, woman?

01:43:55.681 --> 01:43:56.748
Yes, Hamza.

01:43:57.414 --> 01:44:00.648
You have proven that you are a loyal
and valiant warrior once again.

01:44:02.381 --> 01:44:04.181
There were times,
I have doubted about you.

01:44:05.148 --> 01:44:08.448
But you deceived me.
You did not back-stab me.

01:44:10.414 --> 01:44:12.114
I was always with you, Noyan.

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:15.348
But your suspicion did not hurt me.

01:44:16.914 --> 01:44:18.348
I would be like Abdurrahman.

01:44:25.248 --> 01:44:27.214
I ask for another help from you, Hamza.

01:44:31.014 --> 01:44:33.448
Even kids know that Gundogdu
will not come alone.

01:44:34.948 --> 01:44:36.348
We should be prepared.

01:44:37.714 --> 01:44:38.848
What are you thinking?

01:44:40.681 --> 01:44:44.281
Take soldiers with you and position them
within Cehennem Valley.

01:44:46.248 --> 01:44:49.081
When Gundogdu comes, wait for my cue.

01:44:50.714 --> 01:44:53.814
Kill whoever is with or around him.

01:44:57.181 --> 01:44:58.348
Do not worry, Noyan.

01:44:59.714 --> 01:45:00.881
Do not worry.

01:45:42.048 --> 01:45:44.281
-Did you manage to finish, Artuk Bey?
-Yes, I did, Bey.

01:45:51.914 --> 01:45:53.248
-How it is?
-Praise be.

01:45:55.881 --> 01:45:57.214
It works, good.

01:45:58.114 --> 01:46:00.114
-Thank you, Bey.
-Thank you, Bey.

01:46:00.681 --> 01:46:02.048
I hope it helps.

01:46:03.114 --> 01:46:05.181
Bring Selcan Hatun back with no harm.

01:46:06.414 --> 01:46:07.648
If God permits.

01:46:23.081 --> 01:46:24.114
With name of God.

01:46:36.181 --> 01:46:37.781
With the name of God.

01:46:39.114 --> 01:46:43.848
<i>Greetings from assigned Artuk</i>
 <i>to white-bearded...</i>

01:46:45.248 --> 01:46:48.381
<i>...that forms and destroys states.</i>

01:46:50.414 --> 01:46:56.381
<i>Seal of Oghuz Khan came to nomad tent</i>
 <i>with Sungurtekin.</i>

01:46:57.914 --> 01:47:00.681
<i>But it was lost in nomad tent.</i>

01:47:25.181 --> 01:47:27.848
They will go to take Selcan Hatun
with Tugtekin.

01:47:29.814 --> 01:47:32.814
What are you saying, brother?
We just talked about it last night.

01:47:33.948 --> 01:47:37.248
Fool Tugtekin still wants to be a hero.

01:47:38.981 --> 01:47:41.314
Things we talked just passed
over his head.

01:47:42.948 --> 01:47:44.381
He could not manage to say no to Gundogdu.

01:47:45.648 --> 01:47:46.914
How is it going to happen?

01:47:47.281 --> 01:47:50.814
We have the seal Noyan wants.
Does he go to die.

01:47:56.814 --> 01:48:00.281
Maybe death of Gundogdu and Tugtekin
will suit our book.

01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:09.348
Obviously they both are arrogant
and fool not to hear what we say.

01:48:12.348 --> 01:48:13.448
If they die...

01:48:15.281 --> 01:48:17.181
...only Ertugrul and Korkut left.

01:48:19.714 --> 01:48:21.081
Maybe this will be better.

01:48:30.348 --> 01:48:32.381
If Noyan is into this seal...

01:48:35.648 --> 01:48:38.248
...it means that Sadettin Kopek
is in my hands.

01:48:52.914 --> 01:48:55.448
Alps are ready, Bey. They wait for you
at the entrance of nomad tent.

01:48:56.448 --> 01:49:00.748
We will go from stream bed, not to
let them notice us if they watch.

01:49:01.448 --> 01:49:02.448
Yes, my Bey.

01:49:18.448 --> 01:49:20.181
May God give you power, Bey.

01:49:21.881 --> 01:49:23.081
May God send help to you.

01:49:24.714 --> 01:49:27.014
You gave me top of world by
going to battle for my sister.

01:49:28.714 --> 01:49:30.714
May God keep you blessed in both worlds.

01:49:31.748 --> 01:49:33.347
Thank you, Gokce. Thank you.

01:49:47.781 --> 01:49:49.081
Go and bring your wife, son.

01:49:59.381 --> 01:50:02.381
Master Demir, stay here with my mother.

01:50:03.148 --> 01:50:04.748
Bey, how can I leave you alone?

01:50:06.314 --> 01:50:08.781
My mother needs you more than
we do, master.

01:50:12.914 --> 01:50:14.681
Alright, Bey. Alright.

01:50:19.414 --> 01:50:21.214
As you ordered,
we wait for bed stream, Bey.

01:50:28.081 --> 01:50:29.948
You start to move, I will catch you later.

01:50:39.681 --> 01:50:42.014
I have no right to say
you not to go Bey, I know.

01:50:43.881 --> 01:50:45.848
But do not go.

01:50:48.181 --> 01:50:50.314
I have no right to say you to be a coward.

01:50:51.948 --> 01:50:55.081
But be brave and do not go, Bey.

01:50:56.881 --> 01:50:58.314
If something happens to you,
I cannot stand.

01:50:59.714 --> 01:51:03.681
Goncagul Hatun, breathe of Azrael
is always on us.

01:51:04.848 --> 01:51:05.914
Either today or tomorrow.

01:51:37.948 --> 01:51:39.048
May God speed you, Bey.

01:51:40.314 --> 01:51:41.314
Thank you.

01:52:13.781 --> 01:52:17.414
<i>Gumustekin, Aytolun, Goncagul.</i>

01:52:18.748 --> 01:52:21.748
<i>They all want to unite and</i>
 <i>put us into a disaster.</i>

01:52:22.214 --> 01:52:26.648
<i>The main purpose of this gorgon Goncagul</i>
 <i>is not Gundogdu Bey, Halime.</i>

01:52:27.114 --> 01:52:29.814
<i>They all want only one thing.</i>

01:52:30.914 --> 01:52:33.448
<i>They want consignation of Suleyman Shah.</i>

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:39.414
<i>They want to settle to Dodurga marquee</i>
 <i>first and then Kayi marquee.</i>

01:53:03.281 --> 01:53:04.314
Come, Banu Cicek.

01:53:13.181 --> 01:53:14.781
I broke heart of Selcan Hatun.

01:53:17.348 --> 01:53:18.981
What will I do if something
happens to her?

01:53:21.014 --> 01:53:22.081
Do not worry.

01:53:23.281 --> 01:53:25.881
Gundogdu Bey will bring Selcan Hatun
back to nomad tent with no harm.

01:53:27.348 --> 01:53:29.948
-You say so, Halime Hatun?
-Of course.

01:53:31.348 --> 01:53:33.781
Do not bother, you did not do
anything wrong.

01:53:37.414 --> 01:53:40.014
If you think the thing you did was wrong
it is not nonrecoverable.

01:53:48.348 --> 01:53:49.381
Look, Banu Cicek.

01:53:51.148 --> 01:53:53.914
Go to marquee and find necklace.

01:53:56.214 --> 01:54:00.681
You will see when you find all troubles
will be solved one by one.

01:54:14.181 --> 01:54:16.214
First day on our road was
very plenteous, Alps.

01:54:18.148 --> 01:54:21.148
In this moorland we come out
of each stone, Bey.

01:54:22.748 --> 01:54:24.314
We will see which stone will be upon us.

01:54:26.014 --> 01:54:27.648
Stones should remain solid, brother.

01:54:31.848 --> 01:54:34.948
Bey, what have you put inside
of this carpetbag, stone?

01:54:37.781 --> 01:54:39.114
He lost his mind because of love...

01:54:39.914 --> 01:54:42.181
...now power and luster of these men
are also gone.

01:54:50.881 --> 01:54:51.881
My Bey!

01:54:54.714 --> 01:54:55.814
What happened, brother?

01:54:58.981 --> 01:55:01.114
-My Bey.
-What is happening, Dogan?

01:55:24.648 --> 01:55:27.148
So Master Kirmani meant this
by saying "be provident".

01:55:42.448 --> 01:55:45.848
If they get into our marquee
and get what they want...

01:55:47.714 --> 01:55:50.114
...it is our duty to find them.

01:55:51.781 --> 01:55:53.348
If not, we all be destroyed.

01:55:59.781 --> 01:56:03.781
Mother, if people hears about it
results will be worse.

01:56:05.248 --> 01:56:07.048
We should consider people...

01:56:07.348 --> 01:56:09.348
...we think they are suspect,
before they hear it.

01:56:12.848 --> 01:56:15.848
What are you saying, daughter?
Do you know something?

01:56:17.048 --> 01:56:18.214
Whoever did it...

01:56:19.314 --> 01:56:21.348
...it is someone that can enter and leave
to our marquee without hesitation.

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:29.281
I am talking about Gokce, mother.

01:56:31.748 --> 01:56:32.981
I know you raised her.

01:56:34.448 --> 01:56:37.214
But Gokce bandy about things spoken
in this marquee.

01:56:38.248 --> 01:56:41.281
She is the responsible of things
happened to Ertugrul Bey.

01:56:44.148 --> 01:56:45.748
Besides, she is not alone, mother.

01:56:51.848 --> 01:56:53.081
What are you saying?

01:56:55.914 --> 01:56:59.414
Gokce is not aware that she is being
a part of tricks of Goncagul and Aytolun.

01:57:06.848 --> 01:57:11.148
Halime, what do you know
and do not tell me?

01:57:12.748 --> 01:57:13.748
Tell me!

01:57:17.648 --> 01:57:22.748
Mother, Goncagul will become wife
of Gundogdu Bey. I respect to that.

01:57:24.114 --> 01:57:27.448
But things I have seen and heard
keeps me away from being silent.

01:57:29.448 --> 01:57:31.414
In the night we had dinner together
in marquee...

01:57:32.948 --> 01:57:36.914
...I saw Goncagul and Gokce, entering
to marquee of Sungurtekin Bey.

01:58:40.717 --> 01:58:43.650
Do you think that Gundogdu Bey
will let you get away with this?

01:58:46.517 --> 01:58:48.550
Do you think that Gundogdu Bey
will stay alive for another day?

01:58:53.517 --> 01:58:56.683
It is obvious that you are offended
with what Ertugrul Bey did to you.

01:58:59.850 --> 01:59:04.117
You seem to have no idea what you are
doing since you appeal to traitors.

01:59:05.083 --> 01:59:06.783
But my Gundogdu will come.

01:59:07.783 --> 01:59:11.383
He will feed hungry animals

01:59:12.083 --> 01:59:14.350
with your dirty carrion
in this wild place.

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:20.350
Everybody's turn will come. Everybody's.

01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:25.883
First Gundogdu and then Ertugrul will die.

01:59:27.783 --> 01:59:29.717
But before them all, you will die!

01:59:42.383 --> 01:59:43.383
Tangut.

01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:46.450
You go and take care of Hamza.

02:00:27.317 --> 02:00:28.317
Listen to me!

02:00:29.883 --> 02:00:30.983
Everybody hide.

02:00:32.517 --> 02:00:35.783
Do not move until I order you to.
Is that understood?

02:00:38.017 --> 02:00:41.383
-When will Noyan come?
-You will see him when he comes.

02:02:31.117 --> 02:02:36.383
While my brother Gundogdu is saving
Selcan Hatun, we should not idle.

02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:39.083
We must find the seal.

02:02:43.383 --> 02:02:47.383
Since Efrasiyab did not take it,
the seal is still in the nomad tent.

02:02:49.683 --> 02:02:50.783
You are right, Bey.

02:02:51.783 --> 02:02:55.617
But who else knows the secret
of the seal in the nomad group?

02:02:58.683 --> 02:03:00.550
You know this nomad group better
than me, Artuk Bey.

02:03:07.583 --> 02:03:08.917
Do you suspect someone, Bey?

02:03:12.717 --> 02:03:14.783
Tell me, Bey, who do you suspect?

02:03:19.450 --> 02:03:20.617
There is no such person.

02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:25.983
But the person who stole the seal is
not the man of the Mongolians for sure.

02:03:28.417 --> 02:03:32.017
Nobody knows the secret of the seal except
the inner circle of Sultan Alaeddin.

02:03:41.383 --> 02:03:42.483
Dear God.

02:03:43.917 --> 02:03:48.350
Protect our children and our nomad groups
from any kind of evil.

02:03:49.550 --> 02:03:51.083
Do not withhold your help from us.

02:03:52.717 --> 02:03:54.550
Do not give up on us, God.

02:03:59.417 --> 02:04:01.050
We do not have anyone else but You.

02:04:02.850 --> 02:04:09.417
No one else but You can protect us from
the betrayal in our marquee.

02:04:11.083 --> 02:04:12.483
Help us, God.

02:04:14.883 --> 02:04:16.350
What are you saying, Hayme?

02:04:24.050 --> 02:04:27.983
The betrayal is not only
in our nomad group, brother.

02:04:29.883 --> 02:04:31.617
It also entered our marquee.

02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:37.350
We do not know who to trust.

02:04:38.683 --> 02:04:43.450
Every day we are shaken by a new betrayal.

02:04:47.483 --> 02:04:49.483
What is it that make you tell these?

02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:53.817
We cleaned our nomad groups
from all traitors now.

02:04:56.717 --> 02:05:00.950
I also thought like you when Ertugrul
beheaded Kocabash.

02:05:02.317 --> 02:05:03.450
But I was wrong.

02:05:04.383 --> 02:05:09.383
Traitors are still running wild
in our nomad group.

02:05:15.117 --> 02:05:19.783
A very valuable thing that Noyan wants to
have so badly, but belongs to...

02:05:20.017 --> 02:05:22.383
...Sungurtekin has been stolen from my
marquee, brother.

02:05:22.650 --> 02:05:25.483
Who does that? How could this happen?

02:05:26.017 --> 02:05:27.317
I do not know.

02:05:29.617 --> 02:05:32.917
There are traitors...

02:05:34.583 --> 02:05:35.983
...in our nomad group,

02:05:37.117 --> 02:05:40.883
...among us, in our marquee and our
family, who are betraying us.

02:06:42.983 --> 02:06:45.083
Come here the smart boy
of the nomad group.

02:06:46.017 --> 02:06:47.017
Come here.

02:07:16.483 --> 02:07:17.517
So Noyan?

02:07:19.717 --> 02:07:21.950
In which den you have lived in
after your home demolished?

02:07:23.650 --> 02:07:25.750
Mountains and stones are my dens,
you smart boy.

02:07:27.550 --> 02:07:29.350
I heard that you have a second wife.

02:07:30.717 --> 02:07:33.983
Thus I thought you would not come but
you turned out to be a man of honor.

02:07:36.317 --> 02:07:37.583
You did not forget about your first wife.

02:07:42.850 --> 02:07:45.483
Cut it short. Send the woman.

02:07:45.883 --> 02:07:47.117
First I want to see the seal.

02:08:27.417 --> 02:08:28.683
The time of fulfilling your longing is up.

02:08:30.817 --> 02:08:31.950
Hamza!

02:08:46.617 --> 02:08:47.617
Hamza!

02:08:51.550 --> 02:08:52.550
Hamza!

02:09:34.083 --> 02:09:35.350
Bray slowly, Noyan.

02:09:38.383 --> 02:09:39.383
Be a little quiet.
