00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 55 will start after 12:28 min.

12:28.770 --> 12:32.770
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:59.245 --> 13:01.412
I rose from my ashes and came Ertugrul.

13:02.878 --> 13:04.912
To lead you and your kin to extinction.

13:06.245 --> 13:07.812
To sear your heart.

13:08.745 --> 13:10.045
Welcome to my hell.

13:10.112 --> 13:12.378
You came back to die, Noyan.

13:14.512 --> 13:15.512
Brother, help me!

13:19.078 --> 13:20.212
Ulubilge.

13:22.245 --> 13:23.345
Attack!

13:57.878 --> 13:59.912
As if he vanished off
the face of the earth.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.478
O, Bey, where have you gone?

14:10.745 --> 14:13.478
Brother, someone is lying there.

14:14.345 --> 14:15.445
Someone is lying there.

14:51.145 --> 14:52.345
A Mongolian arrow.

14:58.078 --> 14:59.845
Mongols killed him.

15:41.145 --> 15:42.845
Horseshoe marks.

15:43.845 --> 15:45.712
Ertugrul Bey must have come here.

16:01.278 --> 16:02.445
He went that way.

16:03.978 --> 16:05.278
To the horses, fast.

16:18.045 --> 16:21.045
I came to lead your kin
to extinction, as I promised.

16:25.478 --> 16:26.745
So come, goatherd.

16:36.345 --> 16:38.012
By God!

16:57.978 --> 16:59.845
You will find me...

16:59.912 --> 17:03.045
...on every step,
on every breath you take Ertugrul.

19:17.845 --> 19:19.078
Noyan!

19:22.712 --> 19:23.845
Noyan!

19:47.078 --> 19:48.278
Noyan!

20:22.078 --> 20:24.445
Mother Hayme and
Gundogdu Bey went to Erzurum.

20:25.378 --> 20:28.945
In what condition is
Gundogdu Bey's arm, Bogac Alp?

20:29.478 --> 20:30.945
It is no good.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.878
I'm told that it will be cut
unless a cure is found.

20:35.745 --> 20:39.078
And about Ertugrul? What is his matter?

20:40.045 --> 20:43.112
He coaxed both nomad
tribes' Beys throughout the council...

20:43.178 --> 20:45.512
...to convince them to migrate
to Byzantine border.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.045
-Was anyone convinced?
-No one.

20:49.278 --> 20:51.712
All the Beys want to migrate to Ahlat.

20:52.512 --> 20:57.378
However, Ertugrul Bey says he will
go alone, even if no one else comes.

21:27.845 --> 21:31.178
Ertugrul is left alone in his
nomad group henceforth, Ameer Sadettin.

21:32.312 --> 21:34.445
What is it that makes you so anxious?

21:38.712 --> 21:40.145
Ertugrul is not a fool.

21:42.078 --> 21:45.078
And he is certainly not a lonely lunatic.

21:49.745 --> 21:54.845
He would not take such a way
if he has not a great power behind him.

21:56.445 --> 21:58.012
What kind of power?

22:02.745 --> 22:03.812
I do not know.

22:05.112 --> 22:07.212
But I will find out at the earliest.

22:09.012 --> 22:12.512
Why is Byzantium border
this much important to you?

22:18.112 --> 22:24.345
There are rich lands neither Byzantium
nor Seljuk Empire have influence on.

22:26.978 --> 22:29.078
I want them for myself, Goncagul Hatun.

22:41.712 --> 22:44.812
How can I give this news
to Halime while she is with a child?

22:46.412 --> 22:50.345
And my mother? She talked about
nothing else but Dundar.

22:51.345 --> 22:55.012
My mother, who took to the roads
like a pilgrim for one of her sons...

22:55.078 --> 22:57.178
How will she accept
her other son's absence?

23:02.045 --> 23:04.912
Bey, catch your breath first.

23:06.012 --> 23:08.145
We will think calmly and find a way.

23:10.245 --> 23:12.078
How many hardships have we survived?

23:12.145 --> 23:14.378
-We will survive this, too.
-We will.

23:24.345 --> 23:25.345
Noyan...

23:27.012 --> 23:29.278
...knew Dundar and Yigit were coming.

23:30.178 --> 23:32.945
He did not lay a finger on them
when he had the chance.

23:35.378 --> 23:37.412
That dog desire for something else.

24:07.412 --> 24:12.445
Long live, Sungurtekin Bey!

24:13.045 --> 24:17.878
Long live, Sungurtekin Bey!

24:20.478 --> 24:25.412
Long live, Sungurtekin Bey!

24:31.278 --> 24:32.478
Alps!

24:33.312 --> 24:39.745
Because of his illness, Gundogdu Bey
gave up Lead Alp duty on his own accord.

24:41.145 --> 24:44.312
The Headquarters
deemed me worthy of this duty.

24:46.145 --> 24:50.178
The time has come
to make changes, to say new things.

24:51.312 --> 24:54.312
Hereafter, the Alps'
benchmarks will change.

24:56.012 --> 25:00.045
We will divide into sections
like the Seljukian Army does.

25:01.278 --> 25:03.912
Every section's duty will be different.

25:05.112 --> 25:10.812
And one will be responsible
for the duty of the section he belongs to.

25:16.845 --> 25:21.945
We will move much like a regular army
against the forthcoming dangers.

25:23.778 --> 25:25.978
Now, all to training!

25:36.112 --> 25:37.245
Go on!

25:48.278 --> 25:49.978
-Tugtekin Bey.
-Sungurtekin Bey.

25:52.012 --> 25:54.345
May your duty be fortunate
for you and nomad group.

25:54.412 --> 25:55.945
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey.

25:56.878 --> 25:59.478
Our Alps will learn a lot
from you thanks to your merits.

26:01.145 --> 26:05.112
However, you speak as if we are in war.

26:05.178 --> 26:07.512
Our nomad groups
may be in peace, Tugtekin Bey.

26:08.112 --> 26:11.345
But the time of peace
is the closest time to war.

26:14.945 --> 26:18.712
For this, our Alps
have to be ready for war at all times.

27:08.212 --> 27:11.945
-Do I have permission, Selcan Hatun?
-Come, Turali.

27:16.212 --> 27:18.778
Turali Alp, come.

27:21.078 --> 27:22.378
How have you been?

27:22.445 --> 27:25.245
-I am fine, thank you, Selcan Hatun.
-Thank God.

27:27.045 --> 27:30.778
Do not be upset and do not be
afraid because Gundogdu Bey left.

27:30.845 --> 27:33.912
I took an oath to protect
the women of our nomad group.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.045
God bless!

27:38.845 --> 27:42.178
Then your first Alp gold
is from Selcan Hatun.

27:49.978 --> 27:51.112
Here, take it.

27:58.012 --> 28:00.212
There is no more fear for us, from now on.

28:03.945 --> 28:06.945
The Alps always obey Ertugrul.

28:08.778 --> 28:15.012
If he put his mind to leaving as you said
his Alps would not leave him alone.

28:16.145 --> 28:18.912
But, without your permission...

28:18.978 --> 28:23.212
...neither the nomad group nor
Ertugrul can take a step, Ameer Sadettin.

28:30.812 --> 28:33.745
You are very well aware of
the governmental tendency.

28:34.712 --> 28:37.312
You are a smart woman. That is good.

28:38.112 --> 28:44.778
True, whoever desires to migrate
has to knock on my door.

28:47.212 --> 28:49.712
Still, I would not want
to let my guard down.

28:51.112 --> 28:55.512
Both Kayi and Dodurga
will learn to obey me.

28:59.212 --> 29:02.045
Or they will meet their match
like the rebel Turkmens.

29:03.878 --> 29:06.245
Although, the latter
would not suit my book.

29:07.412 --> 29:11.478
Sultan Aleaddin does not
like me being daggers drown...

29:12.912 --> 29:15.745
...with this void of
intellect Turkmen tribe.

29:16.912 --> 29:18.145
What will you do?

29:19.278 --> 29:23.778
I will conquer both
nomad group's tents from inside.

29:25.212 --> 29:28.478
Only then Ertugrul can be stopped.

29:30.812 --> 29:34.912
Ameer Sadettin, after all that is
happened, is this possible?

29:36.012 --> 29:38.312
Ertugrul is the hero
for both nomad groups.

29:39.878 --> 29:44.012
It is time he has the taste of a defeat.

29:45.378 --> 29:51.078
To one, the biggest strike
comes from his brothers.

29:52.312 --> 29:54.045
Goncagul Hatun...

29:54.178 --> 30:01.178
...what if I manage to sow discord
among Ertugrul and his brothers?

30:33.712 --> 30:37.078
I'm concerned about Ertugrul Bey's
words at the headquarters yesterday.

30:41.245 --> 30:45.812
It is an adventure to go to the lands
we do not know just when we found peace.

30:59.145 --> 31:01.512
I sit in front of
the cachet of my ancestors.

31:03.745 --> 31:06.912
How can I drag my people
to an unknown adventure...

31:06.978 --> 31:10.712
...while many Dodurgans follow
the words coming out of my mouth?

31:11.212 --> 31:13.812
I do not understand
Ertugrul Bey insisting on...

31:13.878 --> 31:15.312
...going to Byzantium border.

31:16.312 --> 31:20.778
Ertugrul Bey was right about everything
he said to this day, Tugtekin Bey.

31:20.845 --> 31:23.345
You are right, he was.

31:23.412 --> 31:25.178
But he is making a mistake now.

31:26.078 --> 31:28.812
I hope you did not think
like him, too, Sungurtekin Bey.

31:37.278 --> 31:40.112
It is early to talk about
such matters Tugtekin Bey.

31:40.178 --> 31:43.178
Once my mother and brother comes
back to nomad tent unharmed...

31:43.245 --> 31:46.512
...we will counsel.
Whatever necessary will be done.

31:46.745 --> 31:48.145
You are right.

31:51.778 --> 31:54.512
But you know Ertugrul Bey
better than I do, Sungurtekin Bey.

31:54.745 --> 31:56.178
His blood runs fast.

31:56.245 --> 32:01.945
And you know most of Kayi Alps will
follow Ertugrul Bey upon his one word.

32:02.012 --> 32:03.778
Gundogdu Bey knows this, too.

32:03.845 --> 32:08.278
But our path,
as Gundogdu Bey said, is Ahlat.

32:09.745 --> 32:12.278
Beyond that is nothing
but an unripe dream.

32:13.078 --> 32:15.745
After all the calamities,
when we found peace...

32:15.812 --> 32:17.778
...I do not want us to get divided.

32:19.712 --> 32:23.445
Tugtekin Bey, I think
in the same way as you.

32:24.145 --> 32:26.112
But this is not our only problem.

32:27.112 --> 32:31.312
As you know, too, no matter
which way our desire to migrate goes...

32:31.378 --> 32:34.245
...Ameer Sadettin will
certainly create difficulties.

33:06.345 --> 33:08.412
Welcome, Halime Sultan.

33:08.478 --> 33:10.212
Thank you, Banu Cicek.

33:11.245 --> 33:12.512
You bothered for me.

33:13.945 --> 33:15.778
What did I even do?

33:15.845 --> 33:20.845
Especially after all you did
for me with Ertugrul Bey.

33:20.912 --> 33:22.045
Do not mention it.

33:38.312 --> 33:42.445
It seems from your condition
you missed your brother very much.

33:42.512 --> 33:45.945
Would I not? I missed him so much.

33:46.012 --> 33:47.945
His longing fills my heart.

33:48.378 --> 33:50.912
You cannot imagine what a joy it is...

33:50.978 --> 33:53.045
...to know my brother will come to me.

33:53.845 --> 33:55.745
Yet, him leaving is one trouble...

33:56.178 --> 33:58.412
...waiting him to return
is thousands of trouble.

33:59.478 --> 34:03.812
When you longed for this much,
and while his return is soon...

34:03.878 --> 34:06.345
...why would waiting
be trouble, Halime Sultan?

34:08.978 --> 34:12.312
My father and I suffered a lot
because of Yigit becoming a shahzada.

34:13.512 --> 34:15.445
We fled from land to land to live.

34:16.912 --> 34:20.478
We went without food and water for days.
We did not sleep in peace for once.

34:23.712 --> 34:28.045
I always lived with the fear of something
happening to my brother and father.

34:31.145 --> 34:33.845
Now when I am far away
from Yigit, my fears grow more.

34:35.912 --> 34:38.412
Our state's enemies never missed a beat.

34:39.812 --> 34:41.145
They will not, I know.

34:42.345 --> 34:44.912
My fear is they will do
something to my brother.

34:44.978 --> 34:46.778
That is why I worry.

34:49.045 --> 34:53.978
The condition our state is in,
the traitors in the palace...

34:54.712 --> 34:56.845
Yigit becoming shahzada...

34:58.512 --> 35:01.112
My fear heightens when
I think about these.

35:02.912 --> 35:06.312
I hope I will rejoin with my brother
without any harm coming to him.

35:06.378 --> 35:08.978
You keep your heart at ease Halime Sultan.

35:09.945 --> 35:12.978
You will reach your brother
alive and well, hopefully.

35:13.045 --> 35:15.778
Hopefully. Thank you, Banu Cicek.

35:57.112 --> 35:59.078
Dundar? Dundar, are you okay?

36:00.945 --> 36:02.345
When Noyan strips your skin...

36:02.412 --> 36:06.745
...I will be with him, Dundar,
the son of Suleyman Shah.

36:07.912 --> 36:09.212
Tie them up!

36:14.312 --> 36:16.478
Let go!

36:16.712 --> 36:19.045
-Dundar, are you okay?
-Shut up boy!

36:19.112 --> 36:21.912
I am fine, brother. Do not worry.

37:03.078 --> 37:07.745
My God, grant Gundogdu Bey to me.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.078
Give him remedy.

37:13.445 --> 37:16.378
Do not test him with
his incapability, my God.

37:24.278 --> 37:25.412
Sister.

37:31.112 --> 37:32.812
Do not worry, sister.

37:35.245 --> 37:39.045
Brother Gundogdu will find cure and return
from Erzurum with God's permitting.

37:39.112 --> 37:41.978
I hope so, Gokce, I hope so.

37:45.245 --> 37:48.112
I hope you will recover from
what you are going through...

37:48.178 --> 37:49.812
...within a short time.

37:53.778 --> 37:55.012
Gokce...

37:57.512 --> 37:59.245
...I spoke with Tugtekin Bey.

37:59.878 --> 38:03.178
What? What are you saying, sister?

38:04.412 --> 38:06.878
Sister, why did you
speak with Tugtekin Bey?

38:08.812 --> 38:10.045
I wish you had not, sister.

38:15.878 --> 38:20.878
I know, Tugtekin Bey's anger
must have increased now.

38:22.912 --> 38:26.045
I could not stand for you
to fade away in front of my eyes.

38:26.112 --> 38:30.178
Should I have turned my back on your
sorrow and ignore your silent clamor?

38:32.745 --> 38:33.745
Sister.

38:35.845 --> 38:37.245
Please, forgive me.

38:39.945 --> 38:43.478
I do not know what to do,
what to say anymore.

38:48.312 --> 38:49.345
Sister.

38:52.045 --> 38:55.378
Did Tugtekin Bey say
"I will embrace Gokce"?

38:56.878 --> 38:59.112
Did he say he will forgive me?

39:01.845 --> 39:05.278
Or will he continue
to burn me in the fires of hell?

39:06.278 --> 39:07.912
Do not say that, sister.

39:07.978 --> 39:10.078
He will eventually understand the truth.

39:10.145 --> 39:14.345
Know this, a man's anger
is only as much as his love.

39:14.412 --> 39:16.345
Look at Gundogdu Bey and me.

39:16.412 --> 39:19.845
How many troubles we have
been through? How many pains we suffered?

39:19.912 --> 39:22.445
But our love won at the end.

39:22.512 --> 39:25.512
Eventually your love will win, too, Gokce.

39:27.745 --> 39:29.478
Do you mean that, sister?

39:30.912 --> 39:33.212
Does Tugtekin Bey still love me?

39:33.278 --> 39:34.712
Surely, he does.

39:35.345 --> 39:38.045
And do you think it only burns your heart?

39:38.112 --> 39:40.712
His heart is ablaze, too.

39:41.178 --> 39:43.112
His lungs burn with every breath.

39:43.878 --> 39:46.712
I saw it in Tugtekin Bey's eyes, sister.

39:49.212 --> 39:50.845
You stand tall.

39:50.912 --> 39:52.878
Be fortitude.

39:52.945 --> 39:55.312
All rivers fall into the sea.

39:57.512 --> 39:59.045
My sister.

41:04.712 --> 41:05.912
Halime Sultan.

41:05.978 --> 41:08.312
Let me know if you need anything.

41:08.378 --> 41:11.745
Thank you, Banu Cicek.
You are already exhausted enough.

41:35.978 --> 41:39.178
My God, what is wrong with them?

42:10.778 --> 42:12.712
Ertugrul Bey, did something happen?

42:19.078 --> 42:21.112
What is it with you?

42:30.812 --> 42:32.012
Dogan Alp.

42:35.345 --> 42:38.778
Ertugrul Bey, speak, please, tell me.

42:42.345 --> 42:43.778
Dogan Alp.

42:47.178 --> 42:48.878
Turgut.

42:51.445 --> 42:53.378
Bamsi, speak, what happened?

43:00.245 --> 43:01.245
Halime.

43:02.712 --> 43:04.345
Stay strong against what I will say.

43:08.445 --> 43:09.445
Noyan.

43:12.978 --> 43:15.812
-Noyan kidnapped Dundar and Yigit Alp.
-What?

43:16.812 --> 43:18.278
We couldn't catch him.

43:18.345 --> 43:21.078
My brother! Yigit!

43:25.512 --> 43:26.912
Halime.

43:30.312 --> 43:31.345
Halime.

43:33.078 --> 43:34.478
Halime.

43:34.712 --> 43:36.445
-Call Artuk Bey.
-Right off, Bey.

44:37.478 --> 44:39.745
I came to see his highness, Ameer.

44:52.778 --> 44:56.411
Your highness Ameer,
Merchant Abdullah wishes to see you.

44:57.312 --> 44:59.078
Merchant Abdullah, huh?

45:01.312 --> 45:02.712
Let him come in.

45:38.845 --> 45:40.312
You are hungry, I guess.

45:43.712 --> 45:45.078
You are in good spirits.

45:45.145 --> 45:47.345
So you captured those two boys.

45:48.845 --> 45:50.312
Yes, that's right.

45:51.178 --> 45:53.078
Moreover, Ertugrul was there, too.

45:54.012 --> 45:56.478
Ertugrul? What was he doing there?

45:56.712 --> 45:57.745
I do not know.

45:59.478 --> 46:05.145
But I sent both boys to my den,
staring into Ertugrul's eyes.

46:06.412 --> 46:08.012
Nice!

46:09.178 --> 46:12.712
Ertugrul must not have
the face to look at his wife's face.

46:17.212 --> 46:19.712
What about Dundar? Is Dundar alive?

46:21.178 --> 46:22.812
What will you do with Dundar?

46:31.512 --> 46:33.478
I want Dundar from you, Noyan.

46:34.145 --> 46:35.512
I need Dundar.

46:47.278 --> 46:48.278
Yigit.

46:50.078 --> 46:51.245
Yigit.

47:04.512 --> 47:07.512
Bey, Halime Sultan
is alright but she is in labour.

47:07.745 --> 47:09.312
Let Midwife Hatun know immediately.

47:10.978 --> 47:12.345
I will do it, Bey.

47:14.278 --> 47:18.278
Selcan Hatun, prepare hot water.
It will be needed when midwife arrives.

47:18.345 --> 47:19.978
I will prepare it right off.

47:41.778 --> 47:45.745
There was still time, Artuk Bey.
But you say my child will be born early.

47:45.812 --> 47:47.478
Did something happen to him?

47:47.712 --> 47:50.345
Bey, keep your heart at ease.

47:50.412 --> 47:53.378
Nothing bad happened
to your child, thank God.

47:53.445 --> 47:56.412
Halime Sultan's sorrow
must have triggered the birth.

47:56.478 --> 47:59.478
I hope, your child will be born in health.

48:00.412 --> 48:01.878
I hope.

48:10.212 --> 48:14.078
That Noyan dog will pay the price
for messing with my brothers.

48:24.012 --> 48:25.878
How is Halime Sultan, brother?

48:26.345 --> 48:29.145
-She is in labour, brother.
-What are you saying, Ertugrul?

48:29.212 --> 48:32.445
Halime's excitement hastened the birth.

48:32.512 --> 48:34.945
Is Noyan's vileness
the cause of all these?

48:37.312 --> 48:39.945
Ertugrul, tell me. How did it happen?

48:42.812 --> 48:47.112
Noyan knew Dundar and Yigit
would return to nomad site.

48:49.712 --> 48:52.978
What do you think, Ertugrul Bey?
Who did he get the news from?

48:53.045 --> 48:57.445
I do not know that but it is apparent
he took someone's help.

49:00.478 --> 49:02.078
I will find both.

49:02.745 --> 49:04.212
I will kill Noyan.

49:05.045 --> 49:06.378
I promise I will kill him!

49:07.045 --> 49:09.078
-Brother.
-Sungurtekin Bey.

49:09.145 --> 49:10.478
Keep your fortitude.

49:10.712 --> 49:12.745
Let us not get into a rage.

49:12.812 --> 49:14.812
We need to take a breath and then think.

49:14.878 --> 49:18.912
What is there to think when my brother
is in the hands of that dog, Tugtekin Bey?

49:18.978 --> 49:21.012
We must go and find them.

49:22.745 --> 49:24.078
I know Noyan.

49:25.345 --> 49:26.812
He will kill Dundar.

49:28.778 --> 49:32.845
If he was going to murder them
he would have done that on the spot.

49:34.345 --> 49:36.245
How can you say that so comfortably?

49:36.312 --> 49:38.845
Then why did not he do it
when he had the chance?

49:42.245 --> 49:44.078
There is a ruse within the ruse.

49:56.445 --> 49:59.245
It is what you say then, Ertugrul.

50:10.845 --> 50:13.845
Do you not know
why I came here, Sadettin?

50:13.912 --> 50:16.212
How can you ask for Dundar from me?

50:16.278 --> 50:18.178
I took Shahzada for you.

50:18.245 --> 50:20.145
Dundar is mine.

50:20.745 --> 50:21.878
He will die tonight.

50:21.945 --> 50:23.978
And the body will go to the nomad tent.

50:25.878 --> 50:29.245
Dundar's body will only fill a grave.

50:29.912 --> 50:31.945
But he is more valuable alive.

50:32.478 --> 50:34.912
It will open many new graves for you.

50:43.178 --> 50:46.312
Damn your graves!
What are you after, Sadettin?

50:47.245 --> 50:50.045
Both nomad groups must come under my rule.

50:50.112 --> 50:54.012
Give Dundar to me
for them to trust me, Noyan.

50:54.812 --> 50:57.812
May you and your rule go down, Sadettin.

50:57.878 --> 51:00.178
I am fed up with you and your games.

51:02.245 --> 51:05.445
You will learn to be patient
if you want to take revenge, Noyan.

51:07.445 --> 51:12.012
Besides, if it was not for me, you would
not even know about these two boys.

51:12.478 --> 51:16.812
You would look at the nomad tent and lick
yourself like a fox looking at a hencoop.

51:18.445 --> 51:23.512
I will make that hencoop's door wide
open for you like I gave you the kids.

51:55.665 --> 51:58.465
-You asked for me, Bey.
-You will go to Geyikli.

51:58.531 --> 52:00.865
He has been looking for
Noyan's den for a while.

52:00.931 --> 52:03.565
You will trace and find that dog.

52:03.631 --> 52:05.098
Your wish is my command, Bey.

52:07.898 --> 52:10.931
Brother, we will take the Alps...

52:11.898 --> 52:15.198
...and rummage
everywhere whether forest or cliff.

52:15.965 --> 52:20.165
Ertugrul Bey, stay with Halime Sultan.
We will do what is necessary.

52:20.231 --> 52:22.265
Tugtekin Bey is right, Ertugrul.

52:30.565 --> 52:34.131
Sungurtekin Bey,
assign all the Alps to research.

52:34.831 --> 52:38.065
Rummage day and night, if needed.

52:38.131 --> 52:40.831
Let us go and prepare
the Alps without losing time.

53:03.998 --> 53:07.531
Halime Sultan is
in the hands of Midwife from now.

53:09.065 --> 53:10.798
When will he be born, Artuk Bey?

53:10.865 --> 53:13.598
That depends, Bey.
It may extend to morning.

53:19.765 --> 53:23.598
Dundar is the last key left on our
hands to open the hencoop's door.

53:25.931 --> 53:27.631
Did you understand me, Noyan?

53:28.965 --> 53:30.831
Hand Dundar to me.

53:30.898 --> 53:32.898
Hand him so you can have the hencoop.

53:40.864 --> 53:44.065
There are three Turkmen Beys
which are enemies to Sultan Aleaddin.

53:44.131 --> 53:45.698
I have informed them.

53:46.531 --> 53:49.065
They wish to come
and see Shahzade tomorrow.

53:51.598 --> 53:54.965
Convince the Shahzade to become Sultan.

53:55.831 --> 54:00.465
Do that, so all the doors
will be wide open for us.

54:19.931 --> 54:21.998
I will take Goncagul along, too.

54:22.698 --> 54:26.098
-Why?
-That is how I like it to be, Sadettin.

54:27.865 --> 54:30.865
But you need to
convince her to come with you.

54:30.931 --> 54:33.631
I do not convince anyone, Sadettin.

54:33.698 --> 54:36.165
I take what I want and leave.

54:36.865 --> 54:38.965
I have no doubt about that, Noyan.

54:50.898 --> 54:52.465
No doubt.

55:26.098 --> 55:28.231
My heart is on fire Ertugrul.

55:28.465 --> 55:31.065
Our child arrives on a much painful day.

55:32.798 --> 55:35.231
Do not think of troubling things.
Think of our child.

55:35.965 --> 55:38.198
Sungurtekin Brother is
going out to search.

55:38.265 --> 55:40.765
We will find and bring Dundar and Yigit.

55:41.265 --> 55:44.265
Bring them both safely to the
nomad tent, would you, Ertugrul?

55:49.031 --> 55:51.631
Ertugrul Bey, she is going into labor.

55:51.698 --> 55:53.531
Keep your heart at ease.

55:53.598 --> 55:55.498
I will always be with Halime Sultan.

55:56.831 --> 55:59.898
I will do all I can for her.

55:59.965 --> 56:01.831
Oghuz women are strong.

56:01.898 --> 56:06.765
May God help us,
you will hold your child healthily.

57:24.065 --> 57:26.031
Did you take the boys, Noyan?

57:27.998 --> 57:28.998
I did.

57:30.865 --> 57:33.065
And now, I came to take you.

57:36.465 --> 57:41.131
Do you want me with you to convince
the Shahzade to become sultan?

57:42.931 --> 57:45.598
I want to see you by my side, woman.

57:46.598 --> 57:48.965
Do you absolutely need a reason?

57:50.665 --> 57:52.798
Fate, Noyan.

57:54.565 --> 57:57.098
Fate brought us together through revenge.

57:59.231 --> 58:01.531
I don't believe in fate, Goncagul Hatun.

58:02.165 --> 58:05.998
I only listen to
the humming of the desert within me.

58:08.898 --> 58:11.131
What would the desert
inside you want, Noyan?

58:13.965 --> 58:16.665
You will see it when you come with me.

58:54.765 --> 58:57.998
Alps, Noyan may lay an ambush on us.

58:58.731 --> 59:02.765
We will divide into groups in order to
not to be ambushed and save time.

59:02.831 --> 59:05.698
I sent a group of Alps
to search the riverside.

59:06.231 --> 59:08.898
And we will search
the forest and the rocky place.

59:09.531 --> 59:13.265
We will leave no land stepped,
no rocks searched under.

59:14.598 --> 59:15.598
All to their duties!

59:37.498 --> 59:38.865
Halime!

59:38.931 --> 59:40.565
Halime Sister, are you alright?

59:44.165 --> 59:47.231
-Midwife Hatun!
-Let us maintain our silence.

59:47.865 --> 59:49.931
Halime Hatun needs especially this.

59:51.098 --> 59:55.198
Midwife Hatun, I guess
my baby is coming. I feel it.

59:55.265 --> 59:57.698
If God permits.
There is still a little time.

00:59:58.665 --> 01:00:00.665
-What will we do?
-Let us take you here.

01:00:00.731 --> 01:00:02.598
Come.

01:00:04.465 --> 01:00:07.065
Calm down.

01:00:07.898 --> 01:00:09.665
Take deep breaths.

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:11.865
Calm down. Calm.

01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:16.565
-You are alright.
-Very nice.

01:00:17.131 --> 01:00:20.531
Calm down. Everything is alright.

01:00:23.665 --> 01:00:26.265
You are alright, aren't you? You are.

01:00:29.865 --> 01:00:32.765
Very nice. Take a deep breath.

01:00:56.165 --> 01:00:57.865
What is the situation?

01:00:57.931 --> 01:00:59.865
Our baby is on the way, Ertugrul Bey.

01:00:59.931 --> 01:01:02.865
But Midwife says
it does not seem as if it will be easy.

01:01:02.931 --> 01:01:04.065
Just a little patience.

01:01:10.931 --> 01:01:16.165
Ertugrul Bey, hopefully, Halime Sultan
will give birth to your child safely.

01:01:16.231 --> 01:01:18.831
Both nomad groups' midwifes are with her.

01:01:19.265 --> 01:01:21.265
You should keep your heart at ease.

01:01:23.965 --> 01:01:26.598
Thank you, Artuk Bey. Thank you.

01:01:44.998 --> 01:01:47.498
This is the path I mentioned, Turgut Alp.

01:02:02.998 --> 01:02:08.631
Since Ertugrul Bey knew Noyan would
be back, he ordered me to find his den.

01:02:09.598 --> 01:02:11.498
I have been tracing for a long time.

01:02:12.198 --> 01:02:15.665
But the only trace
I could find is on this path.

01:02:22.665 --> 01:02:23.765
The marks are quite old.

01:02:25.631 --> 01:02:27.265
No one lives around here.

01:02:29.665 --> 01:02:30.798
The odd thing is...

01:02:33.031 --> 01:02:34.965
...there are spoors of nearly 20 horses.

01:02:38.165 --> 01:02:40.998
Apparently someone used this path.

01:02:41.065 --> 01:02:42.731
It may be Noyan's soldiers.

01:02:43.998 --> 01:02:45.965
They may appear before us any moment.

01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:50.031
We will keep searching
without using the path.

01:02:51.031 --> 01:02:53.265
And we will go back to
Sungurtekin Bey at night.

01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:56.831
Brother, once they come before us...

01:02:56.898 --> 01:03:01.231
...we will make them sing
like a bird and learn the den's place.

01:03:03.765 --> 01:03:06.098
We did not come
to make anyone sing, brother.

01:03:06.165 --> 01:03:07.698
We are here to scout.

01:03:07.765 --> 01:03:10.531
Brother, what use a bird
that does not sing is to me?

01:03:11.898 --> 01:03:16.531
Bamsi, we will not do anything
even if they come across us.

01:03:17.031 --> 01:03:19.765
If they learn we came here...

01:03:20.265 --> 01:03:22.565
...we can never find Noyan's trace again.

01:03:22.631 --> 01:03:24.098
Do you understand, brother?

01:03:25.765 --> 01:03:27.998
Geyikli Brother, did I understand?

01:03:28.065 --> 01:03:29.665
You did, brother, you did.

01:03:31.098 --> 01:03:33.698
Turgut Brother, I understood.

01:03:41.198 --> 01:03:42.865
-Let us go.
-Come on.

01:03:55.931 --> 01:03:57.931
Do not ever be scared, Yigit Alp.

01:03:57.998 --> 01:03:59.765
My brothers will save us.

01:03:59.831 --> 01:04:03.665
I am not scared for myself,
I am scared for my sister.

01:04:03.731 --> 01:04:07.198
If something happens to me, she cannot
even be happy for her newborn child.

01:04:07.831 --> 01:04:11.231
My mother always dreamed of eating
together with her children, too.

01:04:11.465 --> 01:04:14.098
She waited for
my brother Sungurtekin for many years.

01:04:15.531 --> 01:04:16.831
And now, for me.

01:04:19.798 --> 01:04:21.965
We need to get out of here Yigit Alp.

01:04:22.031 --> 01:04:23.865
How will that happen?

01:04:23.931 --> 01:04:25.598
We either escape or we die.

01:04:26.731 --> 01:04:27.898
Be ready!

01:04:36.865 --> 01:04:38.498
-Take the dagger!
-OK.

01:05:00.465 --> 01:05:03.131
Untie Shahzade's hands.
He will eat with us.

01:05:16.265 --> 01:05:19.498
I have nothing to do with fools
who cannot even handle a boy.

01:05:26.165 --> 01:05:27.631
Dundar!

01:05:31.265 --> 01:05:33.565
Dundar, the son of Suleyman Shah.

01:05:37.465 --> 01:05:39.998
What will happen to him
depends on you, my Shahzade.

01:05:40.898 --> 01:05:45.598
He will either go back to
his marquee or he will breathe his last.

01:05:49.798 --> 01:05:54.631
You will decide this
at the feast table I prepared for you.

01:05:57.765 --> 01:05:58.765
Take him.

01:05:59.231 --> 01:06:01.498
-Dundar!
-Let go! Let go of me!

01:06:03.998 --> 01:06:04.998
Let go of me!

01:06:27.665 --> 01:06:29.731
Halime Sultan, take a deep breath.

01:06:31.798 --> 01:06:33.631
Take a deep breath.

01:06:37.265 --> 01:06:39.631
Go on. Go on, Halime.

01:06:39.698 --> 01:06:42.598
-Bring some more hot water.
-I will.

01:06:54.965 --> 01:06:57.198
Go on, Halime.

01:06:57.265 --> 01:06:59.198
Take a deep breath.

01:07:04.865 --> 01:07:06.565
God bless.

01:07:08.798 --> 01:07:11.731
Come on now, Halime. Come on.

01:07:30.098 --> 01:07:33.031
Gokce Hatun, how is Halime Sultan?

01:07:33.098 --> 01:07:36.731
Do not worry, Bey,
you will have a healthy child.

01:07:36.798 --> 01:07:39.065
Our marquee will liven up with his voice.

01:07:39.665 --> 01:07:40.998
Hopefully, Gokce Hatun.

01:08:04.898 --> 01:08:06.798
Keep strong, Halime Sultan.

01:08:09.231 --> 01:08:11.065
Take a deep breath.

01:08:12.565 --> 01:08:14.231
Take a deep breath.

01:08:16.265 --> 01:08:18.598
Keep strong.

01:08:25.165 --> 01:08:27.198
Selcan, are there any news from Yigit?

01:08:27.265 --> 01:08:28.865
Do not worry, Halime.

01:08:28.931 --> 01:08:31.231
Ertugrul will bring him safe and sound.

01:08:31.465 --> 01:08:33.031
Think about your child, now.

01:08:33.098 --> 01:08:35.865
You will finally hold him in
your arms, if God permits.

01:08:37.165 --> 01:08:39.031
Selcan Hatun is right.

01:08:39.098 --> 01:08:42.531
Who did our Beys
let them take until this day?

01:08:42.598 --> 01:08:44.565
Now, think about your child.

01:08:45.765 --> 01:08:46.765
Come on.

01:08:50.198 --> 01:08:52.931
Deep, deep breaths.

01:09:22.065 --> 01:09:24.898
We got out of many disasters.

01:09:25.531 --> 01:09:28.698
God's willing, you will
get through these rough days, too.

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:31.198
If God permits, Tugtekin Bey.

01:09:32.131 --> 01:09:35.765
Halime Hatun is trying to give birth
to your child amongst all these pains.

01:09:36.498 --> 01:09:39.798
But I know, she will succeed.

01:09:39.865 --> 01:09:43.731
Your love will
vitalise her, and your child.

01:09:45.931 --> 01:09:49.865
If God permits, you will hold
your child in your arms soon, too.

01:09:50.465 --> 01:09:51.731
If God permits.

01:10:20.165 --> 01:10:24.831
When you accept to become sultan
you will not only take your revenge...

01:10:24.898 --> 01:10:28.598
...on your father's murderer,
Sultan Aleaddin, my Shahzade.

01:10:29.565 --> 01:10:32.765
You will also be the hope of
many Turkmen nomad groups...

01:10:32.831 --> 01:10:36.498
...who are guardant to see such
a gallant sultan such as yourself.

01:10:37.998 --> 01:10:42.731
Neither me nor my father
rebelled against our state.

01:10:42.798 --> 01:10:44.631
You did not rebel and what happened?

01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:47.565
They throttled your father
like a crazy shepherd's dog.

01:10:56.598 --> 01:11:00.631
Why do you think Kara Toygar
went after you, my Shahzade?

01:11:01.131 --> 01:11:03.165
And Afsin Bey after that.

01:11:07.598 --> 01:11:10.865
-Send the shahzades, Ertugrul.
-And you send my father.

01:11:24.265 --> 01:11:27.031
-What is this?
-This necklace belongs to your family.

01:11:28.065 --> 01:11:31.498
-So you are Afsin Bey.
-That is right, Shahzade Numan.

01:11:31.565 --> 01:11:37.231
How will I know you are him, or that
this is not Sultan Aleaddin's game?

01:11:41.265 --> 01:11:42.798
How do you know these?

01:11:44.498 --> 01:11:48.231
Because, Sultan Aleaddin is the one...

01:11:48.465 --> 01:11:54.798
...who sent them both to kill your father,
Shahzade Numan, my Shahzade.

01:11:56.131 --> 01:11:57.998
I know him quite well.

01:11:59.231 --> 01:12:03.531
At one time, my late father
was on duty in the palace.

01:12:04.631 --> 01:12:05.765
He told me everything.

01:12:06.731 --> 01:12:10.565
In the end, when you were
held captive by the Ayyubids...

01:12:11.465 --> 01:12:15.165
...Afsin Bey killed
Shahzade Numan brutally with a bowstring.

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:19.498
The state would not forgive this.

01:12:23.598 --> 01:12:26.665
He took his innocent head
and covered it in wax.

01:12:27.098 --> 01:12:30.065
Then threw it before Sultan Aleaddin.

01:12:31.131 --> 01:12:35.065
The strange thing,
Ertugrul Bey knew everything.

01:12:36.498 --> 01:12:40.765
However, just to ingratiate
himself to Sultan Aleaddin...

01:12:41.531 --> 01:12:44.931
...he closed his eyes
to this brutal murder.

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.098
Where is Afsin Bey now?

01:12:52.465 --> 01:12:54.665
He got his deserts, my Shahzade.

01:12:55.131 --> 01:12:58.498
He never forgave himself
for killing your father.

01:12:58.565 --> 01:13:00.598
He became miserable with remorse...

01:13:00.665 --> 01:13:05.065
...and died in the streets
of Konya like an outcast lunatic.

01:13:06.631 --> 01:13:08.465
My father told me how he wailed...

01:13:08.531 --> 01:13:11.131
...that he fell into a big sin
even on his last breath.

01:13:14.798 --> 01:13:18.798
Turkmen Beys will visit you tomorrow...

01:13:18.865 --> 01:13:22.531
...to kiss your hand
and pay homage to you my Shahzade.

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:24.798
They have been
waiting for you for a long time.

01:13:24.865 --> 01:13:28.698
What about the Mongols?
What is their benefit from this?

01:13:34.065 --> 01:13:38.565
Noyan is serving
the Turkmen Beys, my Shahzade.

01:13:39.698 --> 01:13:42.131
The moment you accept to become Sultan...

01:13:43.098 --> 01:13:45.798
...he will serve you first and foremost.

01:14:30.231 --> 01:14:33.098
God, give strength to Halime Sultan.

01:14:34.098 --> 01:14:37.831
Ease her birth. Relieve her pains.

01:14:39.498 --> 01:14:43.065
Bestow her with the same cure
you bestowed on St. Mary.

01:14:43.665 --> 01:14:47.165
Reduce her pains.
Render her birth blessed.

01:14:49.565 --> 01:14:53.631
For the sake of your name,
Healer, bestow her remedy.

01:14:54.931 --> 01:14:58.498
Destine us to hold
our child in our arms unhurt.

01:14:58.565 --> 01:15:01.731
Be with him. Destine us a dutiful child.

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:05.465
Protect him from evil, from mischief.

01:15:06.631 --> 01:15:08.898
Keep him away from devil's malice.

01:15:08.965 --> 01:15:10.565
Embellish his morals.

01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:13.965
Do not deprive him from right.

01:15:14.031 --> 01:15:16.165
Render him victorious
on the path to right.

01:15:17.631 --> 01:15:21.465
Do not let him forget about the thousand
years of history of our ancestors.

01:15:22.765 --> 01:15:26.531
Bless him with favors both
in this world and the other.

01:15:27.598 --> 01:15:31.798
God, be our friend and our helper. Amen.

01:16:19.231 --> 01:16:21.698
I placed the Alps where you said, Bey.

01:16:21.765 --> 01:16:23.965
They will wait til dawn
without blinking an eye.

01:16:30.165 --> 01:16:33.131
And I covered the stream bed
with Alps, Bey. Do not worry.

01:16:33.198 --> 01:16:34.465
Thank you.

01:16:35.565 --> 01:16:38.765
Dogan and Bamsi took
the down road. Geyikli is with them, too.

01:16:46.965 --> 01:16:49.665
I should have gone
after him when he ran away.

01:16:53.265 --> 01:16:55.265
I should have found him and killed him.

01:16:56.731 --> 01:16:57.865
Bey.

01:16:59.931 --> 01:17:00.931
We will find them.

01:17:05.165 --> 01:17:06.998
I hope Ertugrul is right.

01:17:09.931 --> 01:17:12.131
If Noyan wants to use the boys...

01:17:13.665 --> 01:17:15.131
...they must be still alive.

01:17:17.131 --> 01:17:18.598
If not...

01:17:25.965 --> 01:17:29.531
Bey, you will return
to the nomad tent tomorrow.

01:17:30.198 --> 01:17:34.631
If you allow me,
I would like to stay with Geyikli.

01:17:38.865 --> 01:17:41.665
There is a road I suspect Mongols use.

01:17:42.998 --> 01:17:45.231
I would like to stay there and keep watch.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:52.598
I will stay put
even if Noyan comes across me.

01:17:53.131 --> 01:17:54.865
Do not worry.

01:17:54.931 --> 01:17:57.131
It is not about Noyan.

01:17:57.198 --> 01:18:00.231
It is about finding where
Dundar and Yigit are, I know.

01:18:03.465 --> 01:18:05.198
Keep an eye open, Turgut.

01:18:05.265 --> 01:18:06.731
Thank you.

01:18:09.031 --> 01:18:10.498
You need not worry.

01:18:22.598 --> 01:18:24.131
Where did you take Dundar?

01:18:25.798 --> 01:18:28.065
He is in a safe place, Shahzade.

01:18:28.131 --> 01:18:33.698
If you accept to take the rein of
Turkmens as sultan, like you deserve...

01:18:34.498 --> 01:18:37.098
...you will make the decision
about Dundar Bey.

01:18:43.065 --> 01:18:45.265
In that case send
Dundar Bey to his nomad group.

01:18:46.498 --> 01:18:48.898
And relay Ertugrul Bey
that I wish to talk to him...

01:18:48.965 --> 01:18:51.165
...about my father's death
within a short time.

01:18:51.231 --> 01:18:52.931
As you wish, my Shahzade.

01:18:52.998 --> 01:18:55.198
How will I know Dundar Bey
went his nomad group?

01:18:55.265 --> 01:19:00.631
You will announce you are the sultan
in a letter to Kayis and Dodurgans.

01:19:01.465 --> 01:19:03.898
They will come and pay homage to you.

01:19:03.965 --> 01:19:09.098
After they pay homage to you, you can go
to the nomad group and see Dundar Alp.

01:19:12.465 --> 01:19:18.231
Then you can take Dundar Bey by your
side and wage war on Sultan Aleaddin.

01:19:19.165 --> 01:19:20.831
What about Ertugrul Bey?

01:19:22.265 --> 01:19:27.931
After Halime Sultan pays homage
to you, I am sure Ertugrul Bey will, too.

01:19:28.765 --> 01:19:31.498
He will want to come and kiss your hand.

01:19:31.565 --> 01:19:36.098
Then you can either forgive him...

01:19:36.865 --> 01:19:40.198
...and assign him on
whichever duty you like...

01:19:41.131 --> 01:19:44.065
....or give him his punishment
if you wish, My Shahzade.

01:19:50.231 --> 01:19:51.965
From now on...

01:19:52.031 --> 01:19:56.231
...I would like to
call you "sultan" as you deserve...

01:19:56.465 --> 01:19:58.565
...instead of shahzade, Sultan.

01:19:59.798 --> 01:20:01.998
May your sultanate be blessed.

01:20:02.065 --> 01:20:04.065
May God bless you.

01:20:42.031 --> 01:20:45.898
Halime Sultan, it seems
your child will be very stubborn.

01:20:45.965 --> 01:20:48.465
He is persistent on not coming.

01:20:56.731 --> 01:21:00.198
Halime, drink a little of this milk,
get your strength back.

01:21:07.098 --> 01:21:09.998
Artuk Bey said to feed Halime Sultan date.

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:12.998
Mother Mary healed
with date while giving birth.

01:21:13.065 --> 01:21:14.465
Go on.

01:21:37.631 --> 01:21:39.531
I brought a cure for Halime Sultan.

01:21:40.531 --> 01:21:41.931
It's Mother Fatma's herb, Bey.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.265
Selcan Hatun.

01:21:47.665 --> 01:21:49.498
We were waiting for you, Artuk Bey.

01:21:51.665 --> 01:21:53.131
What is the situation?

01:21:53.198 --> 01:21:57.198
Do not worry, Bey, our nomad groups'
midwifes are doing their utmost.

01:21:58.165 --> 01:22:02.598
Selcan Hatun, put Mother Fatma herb
into warm water, it should wait.

01:22:02.665 --> 01:22:05.565
Keep it at her bedside
and make her drink its water.

01:22:05.631 --> 01:22:07.731
If God permits, it will be good for her.

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:09.998
If God permits, Bey.

01:22:43.565 --> 01:22:45.831
I had this room prepared
for you, Goncagul Hatun.

01:23:00.598 --> 01:23:03.498
I must admit, I was afraid when
I was coming here, Noyan.

01:23:04.898 --> 01:23:06.031
Were you afraid of me?

01:23:07.198 --> 01:23:11.165
Of everything that belongs to you.

01:23:12.731 --> 01:23:14.531
Are you still afraid?

01:23:18.465 --> 01:23:21.131
I was restless by Ameer Sadettin's side.

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:27.131
But now, I am where I am supposed to be.

01:23:28.765 --> 01:23:29.798
By your side.

01:23:37.465 --> 01:23:40.664
You mentioned me about the desert
inside you at the tavern, Noyan.

01:23:47.164 --> 01:23:49.098
As desolate as Gobi Desert...

01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:53.531
...as fervent as Gobi Desert.

01:23:54.798 --> 01:23:56.664
As brutal as Gobi Desert.

01:23:58.931 --> 01:24:00.498
Where you were born.

01:24:01.265 --> 01:24:03.164
Did you spend your childhood there?

01:24:03.931 --> 01:24:09.098
I have spent all my life there, until
you shared the same meal with me.

01:24:13.498 --> 01:24:19.598
Then what does the desert inside
you whistle to your ears, Noyan?

01:24:20.631 --> 01:24:21.831
Rain.

01:24:23.831 --> 01:24:25.765
Now, I am living in an oasis.

01:24:27.198 --> 01:24:30.131
Anywhere you are is my oasis.

01:25:31.065 --> 01:25:32.265
Father!

01:25:32.498 --> 01:25:34.498
Son. Come.

01:25:36.031 --> 01:25:37.031
Sit.

01:25:43.465 --> 01:25:44.465
Father.

01:25:53.465 --> 01:25:54.631
Son.

01:25:55.531 --> 01:25:58.265
When an animal dies its soot remains.

01:25:58.498 --> 01:26:01.098
When a human dies his work remains.

01:26:02.531 --> 01:26:05.698
A father's most
beautiful work is his children.

01:26:05.765 --> 01:26:08.198
And a Bey's most beautiful work is...

01:26:09.198 --> 01:26:12.998
...his nomad tent, tribe and his people.

01:26:14.998 --> 01:26:17.865
If you will become a Bey
and have your name known...

01:26:17.931 --> 01:26:22.865
....you should love and show mercy
for your people like your children.

01:26:26.498 --> 01:26:31.098
Just as how your heart aches
and your soul shakes for your child...

01:26:31.165 --> 01:26:35.098
...you should feel more of
it for your people, too.

01:26:36.198 --> 01:26:40.965
Now, you, who was destined
for roads and went beyond them....

01:26:41.598 --> 01:26:44.265
...do not desert from the road to God...

01:26:44.498 --> 01:26:47.831
...so your children's compass
can be on the way to God.

01:26:48.965 --> 01:26:53.031
Son. Hereafter,
it is your and your kin's duty...

01:26:53.098 --> 01:26:56.831
...to take over the flag
our ancestors carried.

01:26:58.865 --> 01:27:02.565
This duty is as arduous as it is supreme.

01:27:03.765 --> 01:27:06.831
Do not quail. Do not go down.

01:27:07.765 --> 01:27:09.231
Do not bend.

01:27:10.131 --> 01:27:13.565
Fight until you wither, until you die.

01:27:15.465 --> 01:27:19.731
May God grant you and your kin...

01:27:20.765 --> 01:27:22.665
...victorious on this path.

01:27:23.931 --> 01:27:25.065
Amen.

01:28:04.765 --> 01:28:07.831
May it be my oath
before the God Almighty...

01:28:07.898 --> 01:28:11.765
...the One that creates by saying it,
the One that fills our hearts with faith.

01:28:12.531 --> 01:28:13.765
I will not quail.

01:28:14.231 --> 01:28:15.865
I will not go down.

01:28:16.965 --> 01:28:18.231
I will thrive.

01:28:19.498 --> 01:28:20.765
I will thrive.

01:28:23.165 --> 01:28:24.798
I will thrive.

01:28:49.198 --> 01:28:52.098
God! I will be a father!

01:28:55.598 --> 01:28:59.231
<i>Thank God, who granted me with</i>
 <i>being a wife to an Alp like you.</i>

01:29:00.598 --> 01:29:02.265
<i>May God grant this union lasting.</i>

01:29:03.465 --> 01:29:05.531
<i>May He not give us the pain of separation.</i>

01:29:06.065 --> 01:29:09.931
<i>May he bless us</i>
 <i>a long life with our children.</i>

01:29:11.131 --> 01:29:14.531
<i>Kayi and Kinik became one in this tent.</i>

01:29:14.598 --> 01:29:16.831
<i>We made two tribes one, Ertugrul Bey.</i>

01:29:16.898 --> 01:29:19.898
<i>May the tribes be one</i>
 <i>and our kin be blessed, Halime Sultan.</i>

01:29:43.898 --> 01:29:45.265
Where are you taking me?

01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:48.531
Answer me!

01:30:30.998 --> 01:30:34.031
The captive is escaping,
catch him or Noyan will skin us.

01:34:42.088 --> 01:34:45.021
Bey. We could not find any traces.

01:34:50.388 --> 01:34:51.454
Are you alright, Bey?

01:34:52.821 --> 01:34:54.888
I am alright, Dogan.

01:34:58.754 --> 01:35:00.321
Someone is coming.

01:35:10.354 --> 01:35:13.954
Sungurtekin Bey, Ameer Sadettin Kobek
is expecting you at the tavern.

01:35:14.754 --> 01:35:17.454
-What is it?
-We do not have an information.

01:35:17.521 --> 01:35:19.321
But he said it was important.

01:35:25.354 --> 01:35:27.388
Alps, go back to nomad tent.

01:35:27.854 --> 01:35:30.054
Let other Alps search instead of you.

01:35:30.288 --> 01:35:31.654
As you wish, Bey.

01:35:32.454 --> 01:35:33.554
Dogan Alp.

01:36:27.288 --> 01:36:28.754
Do not worry, young boy.

01:36:29.588 --> 01:36:31.988
You are in good hands of Seljuk Empire.

01:36:34.654 --> 01:36:37.354
Now, tell me. Who are you?

01:36:37.421 --> 01:36:38.988
What were you doing with Mongols?

01:36:40.421 --> 01:36:42.888
I am Dundar Bey, son of
Suleyman Shah from Kayi Tribe.

01:36:43.754 --> 01:36:45.921
Noyan's soldiers were going to kill me.

01:36:47.854 --> 01:36:49.654
I was saved thanks to your soldiers.

01:36:50.354 --> 01:36:52.388
So you are Suleyman Shah's son.

01:36:55.821 --> 01:36:59.354
I always appreciated what
your father did for our state.

01:37:01.954 --> 01:37:03.421
Your brothers, too.

01:37:05.921 --> 01:37:07.488
And who are you?

01:37:08.621 --> 01:37:13.888
I am Sadettin Kobek,
Ameer of Sultan Aleaddin Keykubat.

01:37:17.888 --> 01:37:20.988
I will send news to your nomad tent.
They should know you are fine.

01:37:23.754 --> 01:37:25.421
You rest first.

01:37:26.421 --> 01:37:27.888
Thank you, your highness, Ameer.

01:38:11.788 --> 01:38:13.754
Noyan is waiting for you. Let us go.

01:38:31.654 --> 01:38:33.288
What will we do, Turgut Alp?

01:38:35.388 --> 01:38:38.654
They are going to Noyan.
We will go, too, Geyikli.

01:38:39.454 --> 01:38:40.488
Go on.

01:40:34.888 --> 01:40:39.554
Sultan Yigit, Turkmen Beys
came to pay homage to you.

01:40:39.621 --> 01:40:41.988
They ask permission to kiss your hand.

01:40:42.054 --> 01:40:43.721
Let them come.

01:40:53.288 --> 01:40:55.488
-Welcome.
-Thank you, Sultan.

01:40:57.621 --> 01:41:02.088
Sultan, from now on we recognize
and esteem you as our Sultan.

01:41:09.754 --> 01:41:12.954
My nomad group and I submit to you.

01:41:19.688 --> 01:41:22.088
We can no longer
find peace in our nomad tents.

01:41:23.021 --> 01:41:26.788
The state needs a new leader.
We submit to you, too, Sultan.

01:41:33.721 --> 01:41:37.421
I, Sultan Yigit, accept
your submittance to me.

01:41:38.521 --> 01:41:41.621
You should know, as your Sultan,
I will give you the support need.

01:41:42.354 --> 01:41:44.888
Your groups will be
introduced to peace and justice.

01:42:14.388 --> 01:42:16.588
His Ameer ordered for you to wait here.

01:42:37.288 --> 01:42:38.821
As I remember...

01:42:38.888 --> 01:42:43.554
...how the Great Seljuk Empire
divided, how it fell to pieces...

01:42:44.588 --> 01:42:48.621
...my heart swells with
a deep sorrow every time.

01:42:51.021 --> 01:42:54.754
Brothers must always
stand shoulder to shoulder.

01:42:55.454 --> 01:42:59.988
They must, so the state
can be everlasting.

01:43:22.354 --> 01:43:25.054
Your brother, Sungurtekin. Dundar.

01:43:27.454 --> 01:43:29.021
Brother.

01:43:39.788 --> 01:43:42.054
Brother, Dundar.

01:43:46.988 --> 01:43:50.721
My God, thanks to you. Brother.

01:43:56.554 --> 01:43:58.321
You are fine.

01:43:58.388 --> 01:44:00.421
You are, you are fine.

01:44:02.588 --> 01:44:04.321
How did you run away from Noyan?

01:44:04.388 --> 01:44:07.854
My soldiers captured
a few of them and saved Dundar Bey.

01:44:07.921 --> 01:44:09.854
Noyan's soldiers were going to kill me.

01:44:09.921 --> 01:44:13.088
If it was not for Ameer's soldiers,
I was dead by now, brother.

01:44:14.888 --> 01:44:17.088
What about Yigit, where is Yigit?

01:44:17.321 --> 01:44:20.588
-Yigit is left at Noyan's den, brother.
-Where is that den, Dundar?

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:22.388
They blindfolded him.

01:44:23.354 --> 01:44:27.754
If I knew where he was, I would have
already gone and done away with Noyan.

01:45:07.421 --> 01:45:08.421
Oh, kid.

01:45:16.088 --> 01:45:18.821
-Let go of Master Turgut.
-Kill me if you will.

01:45:20.654 --> 01:45:22.588
Do not be afraid, my shahzada.

01:45:23.621 --> 01:45:25.954
These will not be done to you.

01:45:26.021 --> 01:45:29.321
He is an innocent boy.
What do you want from him?

01:45:29.388 --> 01:45:31.521
You are of noble blood.

01:45:40.421 --> 01:45:44.488
The more of us he likes,
the easier it will be for us.

01:45:45.388 --> 01:45:46.888
What did you do, Yigit?

01:47:13.521 --> 01:47:16.921
Go to the nomad tent
and inform Ertugrul Bey.

01:47:17.554 --> 01:47:18.654
But, Turgut Alp...

01:47:19.588 --> 01:47:20.621
Do as I say.

01:47:50.588 --> 01:47:53.754
Thank God. Nowruz has come and gone.

01:47:54.721 --> 01:47:56.988
Winter was rough for everyone this year.

01:47:57.721 --> 01:48:00.988
Now, it is time to freshen.
Time to migrate.

01:48:01.788 --> 01:48:05.921
Turkmen nomad groups' Beys apply
to my door one by one for migration.

01:48:06.988 --> 01:48:09.854
None from you has come yet.
They must have no time.

01:48:13.054 --> 01:48:16.954
Your highness, Ameer, why are you
talking about this matter with me...

01:48:17.021 --> 01:48:19.388
...and not our nomad groups' Beys?

01:48:19.454 --> 01:48:24.054
Who would know how sensitive I am
about the matter of our migration...

01:48:24.288 --> 01:48:26.554
...better than you, Sungurtekin Bey?

01:48:26.621 --> 01:48:28.588
They will eventually apply to me.

01:48:29.554 --> 01:48:32.788
It is not that you will stay
at Pasinler plain forever.

01:48:35.688 --> 01:48:40.921
I would like you to migrate to the finest
places for your herds, for your trade.

01:48:41.788 --> 01:48:43.521
When you go back...

01:48:43.588 --> 01:48:46.421
...tell your Beys of these
sincere feelings of mine.

01:48:48.821 --> 01:48:52.354
Apparently, you have already decided
on somewhere, your highness.

01:48:53.454 --> 01:48:55.354
I had many places in mind.

01:48:55.421 --> 01:48:59.421
However I think Ahlat
would be the most convenient.

01:49:01.954 --> 01:49:03.954
Thank you, Ameer Sadettin.

01:49:04.021 --> 01:49:06.821
Nomad groups' Beys would like
to migrate near Ahlat, too.

01:49:06.888 --> 01:49:08.521
Very well.

01:49:08.588 --> 01:49:10.921
Then begin the preparations immediately.

01:49:13.321 --> 01:49:16.654
Yet, Ertugrul even calls me a traitor.

01:49:18.754 --> 01:49:21.388
But I am giving his brother to him.

01:49:22.954 --> 01:49:25.788
Hopefully everyone sees...

01:49:25.854 --> 01:49:29.921
...how the state holds the ones
by its side in high esteem.

01:49:33.688 --> 01:49:37.421
And send my kindest regards to
Hayme Hatun and Gundogdu Bey.

01:49:40.421 --> 01:49:42.921
What if one wants
to migrate some place else?

01:49:45.388 --> 01:49:48.621
Who would do
such a divisiveness, Sungurtekin Bey?

01:49:49.754 --> 01:49:52.554
And if they attempt to do such a thing...

01:49:52.621 --> 01:49:54.788
...I would expect you to decline first.

01:49:57.921 --> 01:50:00.588
Suppose, someone wanted to be a divider.

01:50:01.321 --> 01:50:03.688
I am the state here, Sungurtekin Bey.

01:50:03.754 --> 01:50:07.354
The state showed his merciful side today.

01:50:08.921 --> 01:50:15.588
No one should try to see
the ruthless side of the state.

01:50:34.321 --> 01:50:36.088
I wrote a letter to Sultan Aleaddin.

01:50:37.821 --> 01:50:42.021
I recounted what Ertugrul
did to Gumustekin Bey.

01:50:42.621 --> 01:50:44.721
Now, I am waiting for a reply from him.

01:50:47.521 --> 01:50:52.588
The one who punishes my margrave without
my acceptance will pay the price for it.

01:50:52.654 --> 01:50:54.088
Whether right or wrong.

01:50:54.754 --> 01:50:56.588
With her permission...

01:50:56.654 --> 01:51:00.454
...I would like to speak with
Halime Sultan about Shahzada.

01:51:02.554 --> 01:51:07.321
As you know well, this will suddenly
become the most important situation...

01:51:07.388 --> 01:51:12.388
...that will imperil the continuity
of the state for Sultan Aleaddin.

01:51:13.788 --> 01:51:18.088
If we cannot solve this matter
before he sets in on it...

01:51:18.321 --> 01:51:21.788
...God forbid, we all
will be left buried under it.

01:51:26.354 --> 01:51:28.988
Now, go. I will come to
the nomad tent after you.

01:51:31.754 --> 01:51:33.354
May God be pleased with you.

01:51:33.421 --> 01:51:35.054
I will not forget your kindness.

01:51:42.454 --> 01:51:44.421
May God keep your path bright, Dundar.

01:51:44.988 --> 01:51:49.888
Meeting a gallant young man
as yourself pleased me beyond measure.

01:51:52.754 --> 01:51:57.821
I will always be grateful to you for
granting us my brother, Ameer Sadettin.

01:51:58.954 --> 01:52:00.321
Thank you.

01:52:01.654 --> 01:52:04.688
Our state will always stand by you.

01:52:05.388 --> 01:52:06.488
You should know it.

01:54:52.021 --> 01:54:54.354
We captured this Alp by the den, Noyan.

01:54:54.421 --> 01:54:55.621
Turgut Alp!

01:54:57.888 --> 01:55:02.854
I see you two serpents found each other.

01:55:31.921 --> 01:55:35.354
-Does anyone know you came here?
-No.

01:55:36.721 --> 01:55:41.988
But you will fall into
Ertugrul Bey's hands sooner or later.

01:55:42.854 --> 01:55:43.921
That day...

01:55:44.854 --> 01:55:49.288
...will be the day
you die with this woman.

01:55:53.821 --> 01:55:55.054
You are lying.

01:55:56.788 --> 01:55:58.921
You found out the den's place.

01:56:14.888 --> 01:56:17.921
I bear witness,
God is the sole divinity...

01:56:18.721 --> 01:56:22.854
...and I bear witness Mohammad
is his servant and his messenger.

01:56:41.621 --> 01:56:44.421
His Ameer, a messenger
brought this letter.

01:57:13.654 --> 01:57:18.354
You will pay the price for
not yielding to the state's law, Ertugrul.

01:57:21.388 --> 01:57:25.454
You will learn who the state is here.

01:57:31.288 --> 01:57:32.721
<i>Do not be afraid!</i>

01:57:33.554 --> 01:57:35.588
<i>Halime Sultan, hold on.</i>

01:57:36.421 --> 01:57:38.421
<i>-Strive.</i>
 <i>-There is nothing to be afraid of.</i>

01:57:39.454 --> 01:57:41.854
<i>-Hang on, sister.</i>
 <i>-Silence, ladies.</i>

01:57:42.854 --> 01:57:44.488
<i>Come on now, sister.</i>

01:57:49.588 --> 01:57:52.421
You will hold your child in your arms.

01:57:53.388 --> 01:57:54.721
Come on, Halime.

01:57:55.588 --> 01:57:57.754
-God bless!
-Come on, Halime.

01:58:03.854 --> 01:58:06.421
Hang on. Hang on, Halime.

01:58:09.921 --> 01:58:12.621
Your child is stubborn, Halime Sultan.

01:58:12.688 --> 01:58:16.754
But do not be afraid,
he will be mighty like his father.

01:58:17.721 --> 01:58:20.321
-If God permits.
-Hang on.

01:58:20.388 --> 01:58:22.754
-Go on, sister.
-Go on, child.

01:58:22.821 --> 01:58:25.488
-We are almost there.
-Go on, Halime.

01:58:26.288 --> 01:58:28.688
My sister, bless you.

01:58:42.288 --> 01:58:43.754
God bless!

01:58:49.521 --> 01:58:51.421
Thank God.

01:58:54.588 --> 01:58:56.788
You have a child
that will continue your kin...

01:58:56.854 --> 01:58:58.788
...continue your tribe, Ertugrul Bey.

01:58:58.854 --> 01:59:00.088
Thank you, Gokce Hatun.

01:59:01.088 --> 01:59:02.588
Can I go inside?

01:59:02.654 --> 01:59:05.654
You should wait for a while.
Halime Sultan is recovering.

01:59:13.821 --> 01:59:16.288
May God let him grow up with his parents.

01:59:16.354 --> 01:59:18.554
Thank you, brother. Amen.

01:59:19.988 --> 01:59:21.521
My Bey.

01:59:23.654 --> 01:59:26.554
I hope he grows up
in health and wellness, Bey.

01:59:27.621 --> 01:59:29.854
Thank you, Artuk Bey. Thank you.

01:59:53.054 --> 01:59:55.088
Congratulations, Ertugrul Bey.

01:59:55.321 --> 01:59:58.321
May he bring joy to your marquee.

01:59:58.388 --> 02:00:00.888
May he continue your nomad group and kin.

02:00:00.954 --> 02:00:04.021
May our Mighty God always keep you happy.

02:00:04.721 --> 02:00:07.554
May God keep you with us. Thank you.

02:00:19.788 --> 02:00:20.988
Ertugrul Bey.

02:00:25.354 --> 02:00:27.954
We have a beautiful, healthy son.

02:00:29.721 --> 02:00:32.788
Thank God, he blessed you
both to me, Halime Sultan.

02:01:11.588 --> 02:01:14.854
Our marquee was last happy
with Dundar's voice, my Bey.

02:01:15.788 --> 02:01:18.888
We are happy again after a long time.

02:01:20.021 --> 02:01:26.054
My God made us merry with a hopeful gift
as him on this day of sorrow for us.

02:01:27.421 --> 02:01:30.688
May your kin and tribe continue.

02:01:31.654 --> 02:01:34.488
May God give a long life to your child.

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:37.388
Thank you, sister in law.

02:01:51.888 --> 02:01:53.988
Thank you, My God.

02:01:55.354 --> 02:01:59.054
Destine my son with a long life
and blessed holy wars.

02:02:02.021 --> 02:02:05.421
Destine him to grow up with his uncles.

02:02:12.621 --> 02:02:17.921
Ertugrul Bey. God will grant me
my brother as he did my son, too.

02:02:17.988 --> 02:02:19.054
If God permits.

02:02:25.088 --> 02:02:26.788
<i>If you have sons...</i>

02:02:26.854 --> 02:02:31.021
...name them after Savci Alp
who died for when in war with Mongols...

02:02:31.088 --> 02:02:37.688
...Gunduz Alp who fell martyr in my arms
and my late martyr uncle, Osman Alp.

02:02:40.721 --> 02:02:46.021
I have always wanted the names of these
blessed valorous men to live in our kin.

02:02:46.754 --> 02:02:48.488
If God destines and we have sons...

02:02:49.488 --> 02:02:52.621
...may these blessed Alps' names
give honor to our kin...

02:02:52.688 --> 02:02:55.754
...strength to our nomad group
and peace to our family.

02:02:59.521 --> 02:03:02.321
-May God make you happy.
 <i>-Amen.</i>

02:03:08.354 --> 02:03:10.321
Your name will be Gunduz.

02:03:10.388 --> 02:03:12.054
Your name will be Gunduz.

02:03:12.688 --> 02:03:14.388
Your name will be Gunduz.

02:03:19.488 --> 02:03:21.021
<i>Allahu akhbar.</i>

02:03:21.088 --> 02:03:22.088
<i>Allahu akhbar.</i>

02:03:23.321 --> 02:03:24.388
<i>Allahu akhbar.</i>

02:04:55.421 --> 02:04:57.721
I cannot even be happy
to return to marquee.

02:05:02.021 --> 02:05:04.021
What will we say to Halime Sultan?

02:05:35.654 --> 02:05:37.288
I named my son, Gunduz.

02:05:37.354 --> 02:05:40.721
You named him,
may God give him his age, Bey.

02:05:40.788 --> 02:05:41.921
Thank you.

02:05:41.988 --> 02:05:45.621
I hope Gunduz becomes
a gallant and nimble Alp as you.

02:05:46.354 --> 02:05:47.921
Thank you, Tugtekin Bey.

02:05:47.988 --> 02:05:50.288
May he have a bright life
like his name, Bey.

02:05:50.354 --> 02:05:51.621
Thank you, Gokce Hatun.

02:05:52.854 --> 02:05:56.921
If God permits, your child's voice will
fill your marquee at the earliest.

02:05:58.021 --> 02:05:59.088
If God permits.

02:06:12.854 --> 02:06:13.854
Dundar!

02:06:13.921 --> 02:06:15.988
God, you are almighty.

02:06:17.588 --> 02:06:18.854
Brother.

02:06:30.788 --> 02:06:32.688
Thank God.

02:06:35.721 --> 02:06:39.354
You granted me my son, Gunduz
and my brother, Dundar.

02:06:40.321 --> 02:06:42.088
You accepted my prayers. Thank God.

02:06:51.954 --> 02:06:53.654
How did you run away from Noyan?

02:06:53.721 --> 02:06:55.454
Ameer Sadettin saved me, brother.
