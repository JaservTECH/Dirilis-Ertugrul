WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 100 will start after 12:30 min.

12:58.962 --> 12:59.962
Titan.

13:02.442 --> 13:04.642
So, you've brought Ertuğrul's son to me.

13:54.322 --> 13:56.762
Welcome to your new home,
my little knight.

14:00.522 --> 14:02.682
I'll raise you to be a great knight.

14:09.002 --> 14:11.642
With your courage and your strength,

14:14.882 --> 14:17.482
you'll become a great
knight of the empire.

14:21.202 --> 14:22.882
From now on, your name is Kronos.

14:28.002 --> 14:28.922
Ares!

14:39.162 --> 14:40.922
Soldiers! Soldiers!

14:43.042 --> 14:44.842
Get a doctor, quickly!

14:45.522 --> 14:46.842
Quickly, quick!

14:47.642 --> 14:49.242
Damn it, my eye!

14:49.522 --> 14:52.922
-Marya. Take him away from here now.
-Let me go!

14:53.442 --> 14:55.602
-Let me go!
-Stop it, boy, come on.

14:55.682 --> 15:00.282
Let me go! My father will gut you all!
Let me go!

15:00.402 --> 15:02.922
Kostas, help Marya
get the child out of here.

15:03.162 --> 15:05.522
-Stop fighting me, child.
-Let go!

15:06.562 --> 15:07.562
Let me go!

15:08.762 --> 15:10.282
-I'll murder him!
-No!

15:10.682 --> 15:13.362
-Let me go.
-Ares! Remember, we need that boy.

15:14.802 --> 15:15.802
Let me go.

15:44.882 --> 15:49.442
We'll find Gündüz wherever he is,
have no fear about that, my Bey.

15:50.722 --> 15:54.482
We need to find the one
who ordered this, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

15:55.922 --> 15:57.962
It's obvious who ordered it.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.362
That bastard Ares.

16:14.962 --> 16:17.442
He's stabbed us in the back,
in our very own tribe.

16:18.602 --> 16:22.522
He has taken advantage of our mercy.

16:23.922 --> 16:27.042
With this despicable act
he hopes to save his castle

16:27.922 --> 16:30.322
and his neck from my sword.

16:33.202 --> 16:34.202
But...

16:35.282 --> 16:38.202
but all he's done is focus my fury, Bamsi.

16:41.042 --> 16:44.482
He saves Turgut and now he does this?

16:44.642 --> 16:47.162
How many faces does this man wear, my Bey?

16:48.602 --> 16:50.922
He must have discovered that
we planned to attack the castle, Bamsi.

16:52.682 --> 16:55.162
He's kidnapped Gündüz
to prevent us from doing so.

16:56.162 --> 16:58.602
Then... Then let's burn
that castle to the ground!

16:58.842 --> 17:02.402
We'll kill that dog
and save Gündüz's life, my Bey<i>.</i>

17:03.682 --> 17:07.722
If we do that... we'll fall into
one of his traps a second time.

17:09.082 --> 17:13.642
We would be risking Gündüz's life
while trying to save it.

17:14.402 --> 17:17.002
God forbid. That bastard
is capable of anything, my Bey.

17:19.842 --> 17:20.842
His intention is...

17:22.082 --> 17:25.682
to use my son against me
and force me to do what he wants.

17:27.762 --> 17:31.242
So, what will we do, my Bey?
How will we save Gündüz?

17:32.602 --> 17:36.642
First of all, we find out exactly
where Gündüz is being held.

17:38.482 --> 17:40.842
Let me go! Let go!

17:41.282 --> 17:44.882
-This castle will be burnt to the ground!
-Keep walking!

17:45.602 --> 17:46.522
Let go.

17:52.602 --> 17:53.762
What are you doing?

17:58.562 --> 17:59.922
-Walk.
-Let go!

18:02.922 --> 18:04.082
Let me go!

18:15.762 --> 18:16.762
Savcı.

18:18.442 --> 18:20.322
They can't hurt your brother.

18:22.122 --> 18:23.842
He has his sword with him.

18:24.802 --> 18:27.122
They couldn't hurt him, could they, son?

18:32.682 --> 18:34.962
My Ertuğrul will find him eventually.

18:36.522 --> 18:39.442
Your brother can look after himself
until he's found, can't he?

18:42.762 --> 18:45.202
And... you are his alp<i>.</i>

18:47.322 --> 18:49.802
An alp leader never leaves
his alps alone, right?

18:50.562 --> 18:51.562
Of course not.

18:53.642 --> 18:57.962
Gündüz will be back here in no time.
Yes, he will.

18:58.842 --> 19:00.562
What do they want with Gündüz?

19:02.882 --> 19:06.642
Do they think they can settle
their differences by using a child?

19:06.882 --> 19:08.922
What kind of cruelty is this?

19:13.202 --> 19:15.602
Mother Hayme, don't worry.

19:17.402 --> 19:19.202
Their disagreement isn't with Gündüz.

19:19.562 --> 19:22.002
-They won't hurt him.
-What then, my girl?

19:22.722 --> 19:24.762
Then why did they kidnap him?

19:26.962 --> 19:30.402
When they confront an enemy
beyond their capabilities,

19:31.682 --> 19:34.682
they resort to tactics like this
in order to subdue them.

19:40.082 --> 19:42.242
My girl, my girl.

19:43.922 --> 19:45.722
I can't take this anymore, Mother.

19:48.042 --> 19:50.562
Volcanos are erupting inside of me.

19:52.242 --> 19:54.682
I can't stand it anymore.

19:56.442 --> 19:58.802
Patience, my girl. Patience.

19:59.922 --> 20:01.962
Ertuğrul will find him
and bring him back to you.

20:03.842 --> 20:07.522
And he will make them pay
for what they've done.

20:09.122 --> 20:10.322
Be patient, my girl.

20:24.602 --> 20:25.602
Atsız.

20:28.082 --> 20:32.762
If he is in the castle, you must find out
exactly where he's being held.

20:33.722 --> 20:35.082
Very well, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

20:35.722 --> 20:38.762
But how are we going to do this?
Do you have a plan?

20:43.762 --> 20:45.882
You'll go to the castle
disguised as the trader Nico.

20:46.882 --> 20:48.642
You'll have a few soldiers with you.

20:49.202 --> 20:52.362
You'll meet with Ares and gain his trust.

20:53.562 --> 20:55.682
You'll find out where Gündüz is.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.482
If he's being kept at the castle,
you'll find out which room.

20:59.602 --> 21:02.282
If he isn't, you must find out
where they've taken him.

21:02.922 --> 21:05.602
Very well, Ertuğrul Bey<i>. </i>Don't worry.

21:06.682 --> 21:11.442
Question Nico again.
Gather every detail from him

21:13.122 --> 21:16.162
so that Ares won't doubt you
when he meets you.

21:17.362 --> 21:20.242
And tomorrow I'll go to see Ares myself.

21:21.122 --> 21:22.122
Why, my Bey?

21:23.882 --> 21:24.882
Ares

21:25.682 --> 21:30.122
will take more precautions
if he knows I suspect him.

21:31.082 --> 21:33.402
It'll make saving Gündüz even harder.

21:34.602 --> 21:39.082
That's why I'm going to act like I have
no idea he was the one who took Gündüz.

21:39.522 --> 21:41.642
I'll ask for his help locating Gündüz.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.922
And so, he'll relax.

21:47.282 --> 21:50.922
If Gündüz is in the castle,
I won't leave it.

21:51.802 --> 21:55.602
We'll leave at night,
once we've rescued my son.

21:57.682 --> 21:59.682
I'll contact you when
I'm inside the castle.

22:00.282 --> 22:02.762
We'll proceed according to
the information you provide.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.322
Be prepared.

22:06.202 --> 22:07.202
Ertuğrul Bey<i>...</i>

22:09.922 --> 22:11.722
What should I do with him
after I've questioned him?

22:13.402 --> 22:15.282
Keep him here until the battle is over.

22:16.162 --> 22:21.122
I'll hand him Ares' head
and send him back to Nicaea.

22:25.122 --> 22:29.162
-Have a man watch him.
-Of course, my Bey<i>. </i>Don't worry.

22:44.642 --> 22:47.002
Brother Atsız, brother Atsız.

22:47.402 --> 22:48.962
There's something I have to tell you.

22:50.002 --> 22:53.842
Brother, a woman named Marya came to us

22:54.322 --> 22:57.642
when we last went to the castle
with Ertuğrul Bey and Turgut.

22:58.082 --> 23:00.442
Clearly, she's Ares' woman.

23:02.002 --> 23:05.722
Back in the day,
she was one of Simko's slaves.

23:06.082 --> 23:09.362
Simko gifted this woman to Ares.

23:10.842 --> 23:12.162
Why did she tell you all that?

23:13.202 --> 23:17.202
Apparently, there was a disagreement.

23:17.642 --> 23:22.722
If you speak to her, you might
find out what her story is.

23:22.842 --> 23:24.122
Very well, brother Bamsi.

23:24.962 --> 23:27.202
Thanks, thanks, brother Atsız.

23:40.322 --> 23:43.242
-Keep walking. Keep walking, boy.
-Let go!

23:45.322 --> 23:46.322
Open the gates.

23:47.442 --> 23:48.442
Let go!

23:52.882 --> 23:55.082
Let go! Let me go.

23:56.482 --> 23:57.602
Let me go!

24:30.682 --> 24:34.842
Please behave.
I don't want anything to happen to you.

24:56.082 --> 24:59.082
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

24:59.362 --> 25:03.562
I am Gündüz, son of Ertuğrul Bey!
Let me out of here!

25:03.762 --> 25:07.202
Me and my father
will make you pay for this!

25:07.802 --> 25:09.162
Let me out of here.

25:09.522 --> 25:12.762
I've taken one eye
and my father will take the other.

25:13.322 --> 25:14.842
Let me out!

26:12.202 --> 26:14.082
-Sir.
-What?

26:15.602 --> 26:18.122
-I don't know how to say it.
-Speak, you moron!

26:19.842 --> 26:21.602
I did everything I could but...

26:21.922 --> 26:26.722
I'm sorry, your eye
was too seriously damaged.

26:26.962 --> 26:28.442
Stop blabbering.

26:29.082 --> 26:31.202
When can I take the bandage off?

26:31.802 --> 26:35.522
Sir, I'm sorry, you've
lost your sight in that eye.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.802
What are you saying?
Are you out of mind?

26:39.362 --> 26:41.002
Get me another doctor now!

26:41.522 --> 26:45.362
Sir, I'm sorry. The iris
was very seriously damaged.

26:47.042 --> 26:48.242
Get the hell out of here!

26:58.722 --> 27:00.282
Damned child!

27:02.322 --> 27:05.562
I'll kill all of you. Every single one.

27:06.482 --> 27:08.162
But I'll start with you.

27:13.842 --> 27:14.842
Door!

28:20.922 --> 28:21.922
Bahadir Bey.

28:28.522 --> 28:29.722
What? What do you want?

28:36.122 --> 28:37.402
So, you were hunting.

28:38.802 --> 28:39.802
That's right.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.442
Thank God, I've not come
back empty-handed.

28:43.402 --> 28:44.882
But I see you have.

28:46.082 --> 28:47.962
Not a good day hunting?

28:50.682 --> 28:52.122
Stop speaking nonsense.

28:53.722 --> 28:54.722
Kırca is missing.

28:55.882 --> 28:57.202
We've been looking for him.

28:58.242 --> 29:01.402
Kırca is missing. So what?

29:06.802 --> 29:07.802
You know...

29:09.162 --> 29:13.642
I was just asking,
I thought you might have run into him.

29:16.242 --> 29:18.762
You're meant to be Chief Alp,

29:20.122 --> 29:22.322
and your wife the tribe's Hatun.

29:23.962 --> 29:27.362
Yet your alps are able to wander off
whenever it pleases them.

29:27.922 --> 29:29.242
And you came to ask me?

29:30.082 --> 29:31.802
Am I meant to protect your alps?

29:32.882 --> 29:36.162
We won't rest while Kırca is missing.

29:36.882 --> 29:38.362
And if we don't rest...

29:41.922 --> 29:44.402
no one in this tribe can rest.

29:46.722 --> 29:47.722
Know that.

30:16.722 --> 30:17.882
Welcome, Turgut.

30:19.362 --> 30:21.882
What happened? Did you find Kırca?

30:23.482 --> 30:25.722
No, there's no sign of him, Aslihan.

30:27.482 --> 30:29.442
Why is he still not back?

30:31.562 --> 30:32.562
Don't worry.

30:33.322 --> 30:36.442
With God's permission,
we'll find him safe and well.

30:37.282 --> 30:40.882
Kırca would always return here,
no matter what, Turgut.

30:42.562 --> 30:46.202
It's not a good sign
that he's still not back.

30:52.122 --> 30:54.802
Speak of what's good,
so it shall happen, Aslihan.

30:55.122 --> 30:59.402
I'm afraid Bahadir Bey
has done something to him, Turgut.

31:01.322 --> 31:05.402
If he has dared to do that, he has
signed his own death sentence, Aslihan.

31:06.562 --> 31:09.522
There's a fire of vengeance
raging within him.

31:10.122 --> 31:12.122
There's nothing he wouldn't do.

31:13.202 --> 31:17.162
I'll kill him with my own two hands
if he's done anything to harm Kırca Alp.

31:19.762 --> 31:20.762
Don't worry.

31:22.202 --> 31:24.442
I won't let him do anything.

31:25.282 --> 31:27.562
I'll take every necessary precaution
and double the guards.

31:31.202 --> 31:32.402
Don't upset yourself.

32:18.922 --> 32:20.002
-Ertuğrul.
-Son.

32:31.842 --> 32:32.842
Ertuğrul.

32:34.642 --> 32:39.002
They kidnapped our son.
They took our Gündüz, Ertuğrul.

32:40.402 --> 32:42.922
Who knows where and how he is.

32:50.922 --> 32:55.642
Do not fear for his life, my Halime.
He is alive.

32:56.802 --> 32:59.802
With God's permission,
I'll bring him back to you.

32:59.922 --> 33:00.922
Amen to that.

33:02.042 --> 33:06.922
They don't intend to hurt him,
they want to use him to make me kneel.

33:08.042 --> 33:09.202
Is it Ares, my Bey?

33:13.842 --> 33:14.842
That devil.

33:15.722 --> 33:19.442
First, he separated us from Ertuğrul.
And now he's taken our Gündüz.

33:19.842 --> 33:22.162
We won't be able to rest
until that bastard is dead.

33:23.802 --> 33:29.402
Son, what kind of cruelty is this?
How could they kidnap a child?

33:30.802 --> 33:33.402
They must have learned that
we planned to attack the castle, Mother.

33:34.682 --> 33:37.362
They kidnapped Gündüz to stop us.

33:38.722 --> 33:42.842
Ertuğrul, what if they hurt Gündüz?

33:44.642 --> 33:46.642
How could we live with that pain?

33:47.562 --> 33:51.842
They won't do anything to him
until they get what they want from me.

33:53.082 --> 33:54.282
That's their intention.

33:54.362 --> 33:58.602
Son, you would never bow before them.
So what's going to happen?

33:59.242 --> 34:00.962
I'll neither bow before them,

34:01.722 --> 34:04.482
nor will I let them do
anything to Gündüz, Mother.

34:07.282 --> 34:08.882
I will save Gündüz...

34:09.922 --> 34:12.322
and cause their whole world
to come crashing down.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.762
But there's something
else troubling my mind.

34:22.922 --> 34:27.002
How was Darius able to find out about
the attack and tell Ares about it?

34:30.282 --> 34:34.762
My Bey<i>, </i>Gündüz was with us
when you were talking about it.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.922
He said he wanted to go into battle.

34:40.882 --> 34:41.922
I understand now.

34:43.402 --> 34:46.402
Darius learned about the raid from Gündüz.

34:47.202 --> 34:48.362
My God.

35:06.002 --> 35:08.762
Open the door. Quickly!

35:09.362 --> 35:10.362
Get behind me.

35:11.162 --> 35:15.562
Alps don't fear anyone and they
certainly don't hide behind a woman.

35:25.002 --> 35:26.162
Don't! He's just a child.

35:26.922 --> 35:27.922
Stand aside.

35:28.282 --> 35:30.082
I'm going to take his eye
and send it to his father.

35:30.162 --> 35:31.842
I can't let that happen, Ares.

35:31.962 --> 35:33.922
-I said stand aside!
-No!

35:40.002 --> 35:41.562
You'll get what you deserve, Ares!

35:42.602 --> 35:44.802
My father will make you
curse the day you were born.

35:45.002 --> 35:47.322
You and your father can go to hell!

35:51.882 --> 35:52.962
Ares!

35:53.642 --> 35:56.202
What are you doing? He must live.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.762
He must live for our holy cause.

35:59.162 --> 36:00.162
Look here.

36:01.082 --> 36:03.042
-He took my eye out.
-My friend...

36:04.082 --> 36:06.482
think of everything
our holy empire expects of us.

36:07.482 --> 36:09.162
You can't give in to your anger.

36:09.322 --> 36:12.162
If you kill him,
all our efforts will be for nothing.

36:13.442 --> 36:15.522
Ertuğrul can't attack the castle
so long as we have his son.

36:16.522 --> 36:20.162
Our troops will arrive soon. And then
we can slaughter every one of them.

36:22.922 --> 36:26.482
No one is to know his identity
or his location.

36:27.402 --> 36:28.402
Understood?

36:30.842 --> 36:33.442
I'm not done with you and your father yet.

37:32.842 --> 37:36.842
What about you, Samsa Alp?
When did you last see Darius?

37:39.122 --> 37:42.082
I saw him with the children.
He was talking to Gündüz.

37:42.602 --> 37:43.602
I went over to check.

37:44.402 --> 37:47.722
Gündüz said Darius was telling
them stories. And then he left.

37:48.642 --> 37:50.402
And I haven't seen the bastard since.

38:02.282 --> 38:03.282
My Bey.

38:09.202 --> 38:11.722
What did I tell you about Darius, Samsa?

38:13.882 --> 38:15.802
I'm asked you a question, Samsa.
What did I say?

38:18.082 --> 38:21.922
You said we should watch him, my Bey.

38:23.162 --> 38:24.162
And what did you do?

38:25.642 --> 38:27.602
I told you to keep an eye on him

38:28.602 --> 38:32.082
and then he kidnapped a son
of the bey and you didn't even notice.

38:35.402 --> 38:36.602
You're right, my Bey<i>.</i>

38:46.602 --> 38:50.202
That slap was not just for my son,

38:51.002 --> 38:52.642
but for all our sons.

38:55.442 --> 38:56.442
Today,

38:57.122 --> 38:59.322
they have been able
to kidnap a son of the bey.

38:59.962 --> 39:02.042
Tomorrow, they may
kidnap any child of ours,

39:02.242 --> 39:03.842
all because of your stupidity.

39:11.802 --> 39:15.882
Now, hand over your swords to Artuk bey<i>.</i>

39:17.042 --> 39:18.562
As you command, my Bey.

39:22.922 --> 39:24.522
And stay out of my sight for a while.

40:00.682 --> 40:03.602
My God, help me in my time of need.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.762
Don't upset my mother, father
and grandmother.

40:07.482 --> 40:09.842
Give me the strength
to get out of this place.

40:22.802 --> 40:24.962
I'm not here to hurt you.

40:26.882 --> 40:29.402
-I've brought you some food.
-I don't want it.

40:32.362 --> 40:33.362
But you need to eat.

40:37.122 --> 40:38.962
I don't eat the food of the enemy.

40:48.642 --> 40:50.602
I'm not your enemy like them.

40:51.482 --> 40:53.962
I want to help you,
why are you angry with me?

40:54.122 --> 40:56.642
I don't want your help.
You're all the same.

40:57.442 --> 40:59.602
You aren't any different to them.

41:12.922 --> 41:14.402
What are you going to do, my Bey?

41:21.362 --> 41:23.322
I'm going to talk to Ares tomorrow.

41:24.282 --> 41:26.962
I'll pretend I don't know
he kidnapped Gündüz.

41:27.802 --> 41:30.282
I'll ask for his help saving Gündüz.

41:30.642 --> 41:32.482
My Bey, why would you do that?

41:33.682 --> 41:35.762
To see if Gündüz is in the castle.

41:36.562 --> 41:41.242
One of my men is already inside the castle
disguised as a trader from Nicaea.

41:42.042 --> 41:46.122
He'll find out what's going on
while I keep Ares busy.

41:48.122 --> 41:49.522
Ares doesn't want war.

41:52.122 --> 41:54.962
He won't want to engage us
when he knows they're not strong enough.

41:56.922 --> 41:58.402
That's why he kidnapped my son.

42:00.962 --> 42:03.602
He wanted to take over our trade

42:04.522 --> 42:06.322
by assigning a trader called Nico
to the bazaar.

42:07.402 --> 42:09.962
I'll pretend to accept his demands.

42:10.322 --> 42:12.642
Son, may God help you.

42:13.442 --> 42:17.882
With God's permission,
I hope you bring Gündüz back here.

42:18.562 --> 42:19.562
God willing.

42:21.562 --> 42:24.642
I'll wait until I hear
from my man on the inside.

42:25.922 --> 42:27.762
Once I hear from him...

42:29.202 --> 42:32.242
with God's permission,
I'll grab Gündüz and come back.

42:32.642 --> 42:35.042
-I hope so.
-I hope so.

42:36.682 --> 42:37.682
Then...

42:39.562 --> 42:42.602
I'll burn that castle down
with Ares in it.

42:55.922 --> 42:57.482
Nico the merchant is here, sir.

43:02.042 --> 43:03.202
Governor Ares.

43:06.322 --> 43:08.442
I bring you the emperor's regards.

43:11.562 --> 43:13.042
Welcome, merchant Nico.

43:15.802 --> 43:17.322
I wish you a swift recovery, sir.

43:19.322 --> 43:21.282
I hope you aren't in pain.
How did it happen?

43:22.882 --> 43:26.002
The soldiers the emperor sent,
where are they?

43:27.442 --> 43:30.562
The emperor wanted special catapults
to defend the castle.

43:31.522 --> 43:34.282
But the carts pulling the catapults
were slowing us down,

43:34.602 --> 43:36.642
so I asked Commander Teodor's permission

43:36.922 --> 43:38.762
to travel ahead
with a few soldiers as guard.

43:41.362 --> 43:42.362
All right.

43:43.362 --> 43:46.042
-What about the man I sent?
-Yorgo.

43:47.202 --> 43:50.202
He told me what happened.
I know everything.

43:51.122 --> 43:53.802
He made sure we got here safely
and then he went back to Nicaea.

43:55.402 --> 43:58.202
Then you know why
you're here, merchant Nico.

43:59.202 --> 44:03.362
I'm to manage the bazaar,
as you requested from the emperor.

44:04.002 --> 44:06.202
And you'll take over the trade.

44:06.762 --> 44:09.122
Right, but that's easy to say.

44:10.202 --> 44:11.402
How will you do it?

44:12.602 --> 44:16.522
Don't worry, Governor Ares.
I came prepared.

44:17.522 --> 44:19.882
I'm sure you'll like what I have to say.

44:21.202 --> 44:22.282
Wonderful.

44:23.482 --> 44:26.242
Come, let's talk while we eat.

44:39.842 --> 44:41.362
Would you like some sherbet, my Bey?

44:47.402 --> 44:50.282
<i>-May I come in, my Bey?</i>
-Come in.

44:56.602 --> 44:58.282
What's the situation, Kayatekin?

44:58.402 --> 45:02.322
I took a look at the tribe, my Bey.
Turgut Alp has doubled the guards.

45:06.202 --> 45:10.442
With Kırca missing,
he suspects something is going to happen.

45:14.562 --> 45:15.882
The raid tonight...

45:17.602 --> 45:19.122
We can't attack tonight.

45:19.802 --> 45:20.802
Why not, my Bey<i>?</i>

45:20.962 --> 45:25.442
Apparently, the Cavdar alps like Turgut.

45:26.562 --> 45:29.882
If Turgut leads them, we run the risk
too much blood will be shed.

45:30.722 --> 45:34.682
My reputation will be tarnished
if I kill too many of their alps<i>.</i>

45:36.202 --> 45:40.642
There will be unrest in the tribe.
And that will make me lose.

45:41.202 --> 45:42.722
So what do we do, my Bey?

45:52.722 --> 45:56.482
Chief Alp Turgut
was unable to find Kırca today.

45:58.482 --> 46:01.282
He'll surely go out
searching again tomorrow.

46:02.842 --> 46:05.242
We'll move to strike then.

46:06.442 --> 46:11.362
Now, go and talk to Sancar.
Don't let anyone see you.

46:12.322 --> 46:14.202
Tell him to disguise himself

46:14.802 --> 46:17.362
and kill Turgut while
he's out looking for Kırca.

46:20.762 --> 46:23.002
Tell him he is to come here
as soon as Turgut is dead.

46:25.322 --> 46:27.842
I'll take over the tribe
with my son by my side.

46:28.642 --> 46:32.762
Then I'll show Ertuğrul
who has authority here,

46:33.082 --> 46:35.682
him or Bahadir Bey!

46:36.882 --> 46:37.882
As you command, my Bey.

46:39.362 --> 46:40.602
<i>May we come in, my Bey?</i>

46:41.842 --> 46:44.322
The beys are here. Yes!

46:49.202 --> 46:50.202
Welcome.

46:53.202 --> 46:55.122
Go ahead, take a seat.

47:01.722 --> 47:05.202
There is something very important
I want to talk to you about.

47:09.082 --> 47:11.602
Now, we'd like to drink
some sherbet, wife.

47:57.762 --> 48:01.682
I've doubled the guards. I've assigned
an additional alp to every position.

48:04.282 --> 48:05.522
We'll know if a bird flies by.

48:06.002 --> 48:10.162
The other alps are still
out looking for Kırca.

48:12.082 --> 48:15.202
I'm afraid Bahadir Bey has
done something to him, Turgut.

48:16.762 --> 48:20.322
If he has, I will not hesitate.

48:20.962 --> 48:22.442
I'll kill him myself.

48:24.202 --> 48:26.002
He's capable of anything.

48:29.722 --> 48:32.202
I'll look for Kırca again tomorrow.

48:34.122 --> 48:35.722
You should keep your wits about you here.

48:35.962 --> 48:39.442
As long as Bahadir is here, we can't rest.

48:40.362 --> 48:42.642
We're forced to keep
our swords unsheathed.

48:44.682 --> 48:47.402
If he tries to do anything...

48:48.682 --> 48:52.322
I swear to God,
I'll slay him with the sword of my kin.

48:58.442 --> 49:00.042
The Venetian trader, Alessandro,

49:00.722 --> 49:05.402
has agreed to bring his caravans
of precious gems and spices to the bazaar.

49:06.602 --> 49:08.522
What about the trader in Constantinople?

49:16.482 --> 49:17.682
Do you remember now?

49:19.082 --> 49:22.042
-Talk!
-Ares has a close friend

49:22.242 --> 49:23.642
in Constantinople.

49:24.282 --> 49:25.442
The merchant Ricardo.

49:25.842 --> 49:29.482
Ricardo will arrange
for them to meet in the bazaar.

49:29.762 --> 49:32.602
Go on! Go on!

49:38.162 --> 49:40.002
Your old merchant friend, Ricardo.

49:41.482 --> 49:43.602
He'll come here to visit you.

49:45.682 --> 49:47.842
It has been a while since I saw Ricardo.

49:48.922 --> 49:51.522
It'll be good to see him,
even if it is just for business.

49:55.882 --> 49:57.522
Marya, come in.

49:58.322 --> 49:59.642
Meet the merchant, Nico.

50:04.602 --> 50:05.602
My lady.

50:14.002 --> 50:15.402
How is our little friend?

50:17.002 --> 50:18.282
He won't eat or drink.

50:18.842 --> 50:20.402
Are you feeling sorry for him, Marya?

50:21.362 --> 50:22.962
He's just a child, Ares.

50:23.322 --> 50:25.242
I don't care if he lives or dies.

50:25.682 --> 50:28.002
-You either have him behave or--
-Don't worry.

50:28.562 --> 50:30.322
I'll take care of him, Ares.

50:37.682 --> 50:40.002
I'll want to see you tomorrow, Nico.

50:40.682 --> 50:44.682
We still have a lot to talk about.
Good night for now.

51:17.698 --> 51:20.858
Son... Son.

51:22.258 --> 51:23.418
My son.

51:25.298 --> 51:28.858
My son, whom I carried
in my belly for nine months.

51:30.738 --> 51:34.658
My son, to whom I gave
birth in the tenth month.

51:36.338 --> 51:38.498
Where are you, my beloved son?

51:41.138 --> 51:43.698
My beloved son.

51:54.058 --> 51:55.298
My Halime.

52:05.538 --> 52:06.698
Halime.

52:09.578 --> 52:11.178
You have a mother's heart.

52:12.858 --> 52:17.458
My words won't be enough to soothe
the pain you're feeling as a mother.

52:19.338 --> 52:20.898
But have faith in me.

52:22.858 --> 52:25.538
I'll save Gündüz
and bring him back safe to you.

52:28.138 --> 52:30.178
You won't have to sing
sad lullabies any longer.

52:32.098 --> 52:33.258
My Gündüz.

52:35.418 --> 52:39.018
Can you see what our mercy
has resulted in, Ertuğrul?

52:43.138 --> 52:47.978
I can't even look you in the eyes,
I wasn't able to protect our son.

52:50.018 --> 52:51.178
Halime.

52:53.698 --> 52:55.298
It wasn't your fault.

52:57.178 --> 52:59.058
Every cloud has a silver lining.

53:01.378 --> 53:03.218
Our mercy is like an ocean.

53:04.218 --> 53:06.738
We can't renounce it
just because the enemy poured

53:07.218 --> 53:08.938
a few drops of poison into it.

53:11.338 --> 53:14.818
We should be merciful
even if we get harmed in the end.

53:16.178 --> 53:19.458
But if it comes to it,
our revenge will be terrible.

53:31.698 --> 53:34.778
God willing, we'll discover
Kırca's tracks today.

53:35.458 --> 53:39.098
-Pray for us, Aslıhan.
-Stay safe, Turgut.

53:39.938 --> 53:42.898
I hope you find Kırca alive and well.

53:43.738 --> 53:45.978
I hope so too. Oğuz!

53:47.178 --> 53:50.978
-Stay here and guard the tribe.
-As you command, Chief Alp Turgut.

54:16.418 --> 54:17.458
Come on, alps!

54:26.098 --> 54:27.738
Turgut has finally left the tribe, my Bey.

54:29.018 --> 54:30.498
He's taken only a few alps with him.

54:31.538 --> 54:34.338
Sancar Bey will deal with them easily.

54:35.738 --> 54:41.618
Once Turgut has been dealt with,
Aslıhan and her alps will be vulnerable.

54:42.458 --> 54:44.498
And it'll be even easier
for us to assume control.

54:45.778 --> 54:48.698
Now, we must stay alert

54:49.178 --> 54:52.098
and wait for news from Sancar.

56:36.778 --> 56:39.938
You won't grow up
to be a great warrior if you don't eat.

56:40.458 --> 56:44.218
I don't need your food
to grow up to be a great warrior.

56:44.418 --> 56:47.618
I'm already an alp,
thanks to my mother's food.

56:48.778 --> 56:50.618
Do you want to get out of here?

56:55.898 --> 56:57.698
Then you must preserve your strength.

56:58.578 --> 57:02.018
-And to do that, you need to eat.
-I will preserve my strength!

57:02.338 --> 57:06.898
I'm going to make that traitor Darius pay,
just like I did to Ares.

57:07.418 --> 57:08.738
Of course you will.

57:10.218 --> 57:14.378
We showed him mercy, yet he betrayed us.

57:14.898 --> 57:17.258
I'll not show him any more mercy now.

57:19.938 --> 57:25.018
But mercy is a good thing, Gündüz.
It's the only thing that makes us human.

57:29.578 --> 57:32.658
-Are you a merciful person?
-Yes, of course.

57:33.098 --> 57:35.018
Then let me go.

57:36.938 --> 57:41.218
You have a very strong father, Gündüz.
He'll come for you.

57:42.938 --> 57:44.418
Now drink your soup.

57:45.698 --> 57:48.778
So that when your father comes
he will see you are still just as strong.

57:50.138 --> 57:51.298
Trust me.

57:59.178 --> 58:00.178
Here.

58:30.018 --> 58:30.938
Sir?

58:32.378 --> 58:36.098
-What the hell is that?
-It's opium, sir. It'll ease your pain.

58:36.178 --> 58:39.658
Do you expect me to drug myself
at a time like this, you fool?

58:41.698 --> 58:43.578
You're in a great deal of pain, sir.

58:43.698 --> 58:46.138
So much pain might affect
your ability to make decisions.

58:46.498 --> 58:48.818
That's why I thought we should
seek to ease your pain.

58:49.138 --> 58:52.738
Nothing could ever hurt me as much as
knowing the Turks are on our lands!

58:53.338 --> 58:54.858
Now, get the hell out of here!

59:07.178 --> 59:08.458
The gate!

59:35.418 --> 59:37.818
We weren't expecting you, Ertuğrul Bey.

59:38.778 --> 59:42.058
Let Governor Ares know I'm here.
I have things to discuss with him.

59:45.098 --> 59:48.738
Soldier, let the governor know
Ertuğrul Bey is here.

59:49.178 --> 59:50.058
Quickly!

59:54.258 --> 59:56.098
Sir, Ertuğrul Bey is here.

00:59:58.858 --> 01:00:01.058
-With how many alps?
-Only a few.

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:05.898
-Show him to my chamber!
-Yes, sir.

01:00:13.258 --> 01:00:14.658
You've come to me!

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.738
You've come to me
all by yourself, Ertuğrul!

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:24.298
He might be here to hold you accountable.

01:00:24.418 --> 01:00:27.858
Maybe. Or maybe he
is here to ask for my help.

01:00:28.738 --> 01:00:30.658
I helped him save Turgut,

01:00:30.778 --> 01:00:33.138
maybe he seeks my help
finding his son Gündüz, too.

01:00:34.938 --> 01:00:37.818
Right. We left no traces behind.

01:00:39.178 --> 01:00:41.578
He can't possibly know you have the child.

01:00:41.858 --> 01:00:45.618
No, but he probably suspects we have him.

01:00:46.338 --> 01:00:47.578
He'll try to trick us.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:49.698
So, what are you going to do?

01:00:50.778 --> 01:00:52.178
I'll do the same.

01:00:53.258 --> 01:00:57.898
This game will continue
until one of us is dead, Titan.

01:00:59.898 --> 01:01:04.218
Come with me and hide somewhere.
Listen to what's said.

01:01:14.978 --> 01:01:16.218
This way, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:01:57.738 --> 01:02:00.818
-Did you send word to our alps?
-Yes, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:02:01.258 --> 01:02:03.978
I'll check on them after this
and get them ready for the raid.

01:02:05.258 --> 01:02:07.218
What about you? Did you talk to your alps<i>?</i>

01:02:07.698 --> 01:02:09.338
Yes, my Bey<i>. </i>Don't you worry.

01:02:09.578 --> 01:02:13.138
Some of the alps will change sides and
fight with us once we've made our move.

01:02:13.538 --> 01:02:14.778
Good, good.

01:02:16.178 --> 01:02:20.458
Turgut left the tribe.
Sancar will take care of him soon.

01:02:21.658 --> 01:02:25.938
Remember, there is to be
no blood shed in the tribe.

01:02:28.018 --> 01:02:31.738
Turgut and Aslıhan are our targets,
I don't want anyone else harmed.

01:02:31.978 --> 01:02:35.138
-Act accordingly.
-Yes, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:02:36.098 --> 01:02:38.938
We should expect Ertuğrul Bey to
come down hard on us afterwards.

01:02:39.018 --> 01:02:40.498
What will we do then, my Bey?

01:02:43.298 --> 01:02:44.698
Don't worry.

01:02:46.338 --> 01:02:50.138
Ertuğrul will accept my leadership

01:02:50.298 --> 01:02:52.698
whether he likes it or not.

01:02:53.738 --> 01:02:58.178
Once Aslıhan and Turgut are dead...

01:03:01.018 --> 01:03:04.658
it'll be Ertuğrul's turn.

01:04:02.938 --> 01:04:04.378
The tracks go that way.

01:04:26.578 --> 01:04:27.658
Come on, alps!

01:04:38.418 --> 01:04:41.218
Turgut bought it.
He's following the tracks.

01:04:42.098 --> 01:04:44.898
Remember, this battle is crucial.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:49.058
Turgut has to die if we're to have
unity and peace in the Cavdar tribe.

01:04:49.898 --> 01:04:51.578
I'll be the one who takes his life.

01:04:52.618 --> 01:04:54.178
-You go that way.
-Yes, my Bey.

01:04:54.338 --> 01:04:55.378
And you go that way.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:57.938
-You'll come with me.
-Yes, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:04:59.538 --> 01:05:02.738
Who can save you
from me this time, Turgut Alp?

01:05:28.498 --> 01:05:32.138
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>
-Thank you, Governor Ares.

01:05:33.898 --> 01:05:35.338
What happened to your eye?

01:05:36.058 --> 01:05:37.218
An unfortunate accident.

01:05:39.538 --> 01:05:43.898
If you truly know your enemy
then you'll always be victorious, son.

01:05:44.378 --> 01:05:46.818
You need to hit them
where they're weakest.

01:05:47.458 --> 01:05:51.178
Just like Basat stabbing
the monster in its eye.

01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:57.338
-I'm sorry.
-Come on, let's take a seat.

01:06:00.618 --> 01:06:03.658
I wasn't expecting you.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

01:06:09.858 --> 01:06:13.178
My son Gündüz has been
taken from the tribe.

01:06:15.498 --> 01:06:16.578
Your son's been kidnapped?

01:06:19.018 --> 01:06:20.138
And from the tribe?

01:06:20.778 --> 01:06:22.778
Who would dare do
something like that, Ertuğrul Bey?

01:06:23.138 --> 01:06:24.858
A Greek trader called Darius.

01:06:27.898 --> 01:06:29.578
He had been injured by bandits.

01:06:29.978 --> 01:06:34.058
We showed him mercy, healed his wounds,
treated him as our guest.

01:06:35.178 --> 01:06:36.578
And then he kidnapped my son.

01:06:37.138 --> 01:06:38.818
A Greek trader, you say?

01:06:40.178 --> 01:06:42.338
I'm so sorry to hear this, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:06:42.738 --> 01:06:47.618
But if that's the case, he probably
intends to sell your son as a slave.

01:06:48.058 --> 01:06:50.698
I don't care what his plans are, Ares.

01:06:51.498 --> 01:06:54.258
I only care about saving my son.

01:06:57.378 --> 01:07:00.658
You know how grateful I am to you.

01:07:01.738 --> 01:07:03.778
You helped save the lives
of Turgut Alp and Aslıhan Hatun.

01:07:04.858 --> 01:07:06.538
It was nothing, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:07:06.738 --> 01:07:09.098
After all, we do business together.

01:07:10.018 --> 01:07:13.538
You should know that I'll do my best
to help you find your son, too.

01:07:14.658 --> 01:07:16.978
I came here confident
that you would help, Ares.

01:07:18.658 --> 01:07:20.618
You know the Greek traders well.

01:07:21.218 --> 01:07:23.578
You know better than anyone

01:07:24.018 --> 01:07:26.618
what they do and where they go.

01:07:27.138 --> 01:07:30.858
I'll gladly help you
Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i> Soldier!

01:07:36.858 --> 01:07:38.338
Send out your men.

01:07:38.538 --> 01:07:40.858
Question every Greek trader
you can get hold of.

01:07:40.978 --> 01:07:44.178
Whoever's holding the son of Ertuğrul Bey
must bring him to me at once.

01:07:44.698 --> 01:07:46.938
If they don't,
I'll behead them one by one.

01:07:47.258 --> 01:07:48.578
Yes, sir.

01:08:16.858 --> 01:08:20.258
-May I come in, Aslıhan Hatun?
-Come in, Oğuz.

01:08:26.298 --> 01:08:28.018
Has there been any news?

01:08:28.538 --> 01:08:33.058
-The news is not good, Aslıhan Hatun.
-Tell me, what's happened?

01:08:33.458 --> 01:08:35.378
Ertuğrul Bey's son has been kidnapped.

01:08:38.498 --> 01:08:42.098
Who... who would do that?
How is that possible?

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:45.098
A Greek trader. They let him in
because he was wounded.

01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:47.378
Ertuğrul Bey is chasing after him.

01:08:53.058 --> 01:08:55.178
Yet another disaster.

01:08:56.618 --> 01:08:59.538
God, keep all of us safe.

01:09:04.378 --> 01:09:09.178
-Oğuz, gather the beys here at once.
-Yes, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:09:11.138 --> 01:09:12.138
Door!

01:09:36.498 --> 01:09:39.898
Alps, tether your horses here.

01:09:48.698 --> 01:09:52.098
The weather has broken.
I hope that's a sign.

01:09:52.938 --> 01:09:53.938
Stay alert.

01:10:20.058 --> 01:10:21.418
<i>This was carved on purpose.</i>

01:10:22.258 --> 01:10:23.538
Alps<i>, </i>it's a trap!

01:11:03.338 --> 01:11:06.258
Surrender if you don't want
your alps to die, Turgut Alp.

01:11:19.938 --> 01:11:22.018
If you were only brave enough,

01:11:22.618 --> 01:11:25.138
you'd lower your hoods
and face me like real men.

01:11:25.978 --> 01:11:26.978
Where's Kırca?

01:12:28.378 --> 01:12:31.458
Relax, my Bey<i>.</i> Why don't you sit down?

01:12:33.098 --> 01:12:37.778
Now isn't the time to sit.
We move as soon as we hear from Sancar.

01:12:40.578 --> 01:12:42.618
Prepare my sword and armor.

01:12:43.938 --> 01:12:45.058
It's already done, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:12:46.098 --> 01:12:49.578
<i>-My Bey, may I come in?</i>
-Come in.

01:12:52.818 --> 01:12:56.458
My Bey<i>, </i>our alps are ready.

01:12:56.898 --> 01:13:00.258
We'll surround the tribe
as soon as you give the order.

01:13:02.698 --> 01:13:06.458
We need confirmation
of Turgut's death, first.

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:12.378
Come on Sancar, come on.

01:13:13.338 --> 01:13:16.618
Bring me word of his death
or even better bring me his head.

01:13:16.698 --> 01:13:21.738
Do whatever is necessary,
but get here right now!

01:13:22.698 --> 01:13:27.018
Get here so that
we may take over the tribe.

01:14:13.898 --> 01:14:16.138
-Brother, are you all right?
-Yes, Chief Alp Turgut<i>.</i>

01:14:16.795 --> 01:14:18.338
We need to get back
to the tribe right now.

01:14:18.458 --> 01:14:20.378
The bastards might have
already attacked. Come on.

01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:22.658
Leave me here, you'll get back faster.

01:14:23.698 --> 01:14:27.218
Not going to happen, brother.
We're in this together.

01:14:27.858 --> 01:14:28.858
Come on.

01:14:37.698 --> 01:14:41.858
Just like I said, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>
I'm happy to help you any way I can.

01:14:42.738 --> 01:14:45.298
I hope we find your son safe and well.

01:14:46.418 --> 01:14:48.338
I wasn't wrong to trust you, Ares.

01:14:49.338 --> 01:14:51.178
You honor me, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:14:51.898 --> 01:14:54.058
But I'd like to strengthen this bond.

01:14:55.018 --> 01:14:59.138
I think we should show sincerity
in peace and friendship.

01:15:01.458 --> 01:15:03.858
-How is that going to happen?
-With trade.

01:15:04.338 --> 01:15:05.338
Meaning?

01:15:06.178 --> 01:15:09.458
We can reinforce our partnership
through the bazaar.

01:15:12.218 --> 01:15:14.258
Tell me what you're thinking, Ares.

01:15:14.498 --> 01:15:18.378
Look Ertuğrul Bey, I've brought a skilled
trader from Nicaea. His name is Niko.

01:15:19.138 --> 01:15:22.258
Through him, a lot of Venetian and Greek
traders will come to the bazaar.

01:15:22.578 --> 01:15:24.258
We'll both make more money.

01:15:24.778 --> 01:15:28.738
But in order to do that, I need
some privileges over the bazaar.

01:15:29.098 --> 01:15:32.298
I believe you'll be amendable to that
after all the things I've done for you.

01:15:34.138 --> 01:15:37.138
Very well. Your offer is reasonable.

01:15:38.618 --> 01:15:43.898
But I need to find Gündüz first.
Then we can talk in more detail.

01:15:44.178 --> 01:15:46.818
Just let me introduce you
to Niko before you leave.

01:15:48.298 --> 01:15:49.218
Summon Niko.

01:15:57.658 --> 01:16:01.378
What's this all about, Aslıhan Hatun?
Why have you gathered us here?

01:16:02.498 --> 01:16:07.978
My beys and alps. As you all know,
after Kırca went missing

01:16:08.418 --> 01:16:11.538
we took the precaution
of doubling the guards.

01:16:12.138 --> 01:16:15.418
We now need to take further measures
to protect ourselves.

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.818
That's why I asked you here.

01:16:18.618 --> 01:16:20.498
But why is this necessary, Aslıhan Hatun?

01:16:21.378 --> 01:16:23.338
I received news from the Kayi Tribe.

01:16:24.018 --> 01:16:26.818
Gündüz, son of Ertuğrul Bey,
has been kidnapped.

01:16:27.538 --> 01:16:29.338
-How come?
-Who could do that?

01:16:29.458 --> 01:16:30.498
Who would dare do that?

01:16:39.778 --> 01:16:45.058
Whoever's capable of kidnapping the son
of Ertuğrul Bey is capable of anything.

01:16:45.298 --> 01:16:49.338
That's why the first thing we need to do
is make sure our tribe is secure.

01:16:50.098 --> 01:16:54.218
After that, we'll do whatever we can
to support the Kayi Tribe.

01:16:55.138 --> 01:16:58.978
-She's right.
-Aslıhan Hatun has a point.

01:16:59.058 --> 01:17:00.618
-She's right.
-She's right.

01:17:01.858 --> 01:17:05.418
Alps, double the guards.

01:17:06.298 --> 01:17:08.618
Have them patrol the tribe
in groups of two.

01:17:09.258 --> 01:17:11.138
Yes, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:17.458
My beys<i>, </i>you should be careful too.

01:17:17.818 --> 01:17:19.338
Yes, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:17:19.658 --> 01:17:23.138
Great games are being
played out around us.

01:17:23.698 --> 01:17:26.978
The enemy is rushing towards us
like a river in a flood.

01:17:27.378 --> 01:17:30.258
If we don't stand together

01:17:31.098 --> 01:17:33.338
this river will wash us away.

01:17:34.818 --> 01:17:37.458
-She's right.
-Aslıhan Hatun is right.

01:17:56.698 --> 01:18:00.178
-May I come in, my Bey?
-Come in.

01:18:04.858 --> 01:18:06.178
Any news from Sancar?

01:18:06.898 --> 01:18:09.138
No, my Bey<i>. </i>Not yet.

01:18:09.498 --> 01:18:11.738
-But there is something else.
-What?

01:18:13.018 --> 01:18:16.938
Aslıhan Hatun, she's doubled
the number of guards patrolling the tribe.

01:18:17.458 --> 01:18:19.978
And she gathered the beys and alps
and issued instructions to them.

01:18:23.978 --> 01:18:24.978
Interesting.

01:18:25.738 --> 01:18:27.858
I wonder if she's learned of the attack.

01:18:30.178 --> 01:18:33.898
Sancar! Why have you not yet
brought me Turgut's head?

01:18:35.898 --> 01:18:37.538
There's something else
you should know, my Bey.

01:18:38.858 --> 01:18:41.858
Ertuğrul Bey's son Gündüz
was kidnapped from his tribe.

01:18:45.098 --> 01:18:46.778
What did you just say, Kayatekin?

01:18:47.258 --> 01:18:50.298
Ertuğrul's son? From the tribe?

01:18:52.378 --> 01:18:55.098
-Who did it?
-We don't know, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:19:03.578 --> 01:19:08.378
That must be the reason
Aslıhan has taken all these precautions.

01:19:11.978 --> 01:19:16.658
Ertuğrul can't be in his right mind
if his son has been kidnapped.

01:19:17.738 --> 01:19:20.858
And once Turgut dies...

01:19:22.178 --> 01:19:24.258
everything will be in our favor.

01:19:25.338 --> 01:19:27.778
Come on, Sancar, come on.

01:19:29.178 --> 01:19:30.378
Come on.

01:19:33.778 --> 01:19:36.578
Niko. Meet Ertuğrul Bey,

01:19:37.658 --> 01:19:41.858
glorious margrave of the Seljuks
and owner of Hanlı bazaar.

01:19:45.298 --> 01:19:47.898
I hope we'll soon be working
together at the bazaar.

01:19:48.378 --> 01:19:49.818
Nice to meet you, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:19:55.018 --> 01:19:56.018
Thank you, Niko.

01:19:56.738 --> 01:19:58.538
As Governor Ares just said,

01:19:59.218 --> 01:20:01.858
I hope we get to work together
at Hanlı bazaar.

01:20:02.058 --> 01:20:06.418
Surely Ertuğrul Bey,
that would be in everyone's interest.

01:20:07.618 --> 01:20:09.858
Let's see what time brings us, Niko.

01:20:10.698 --> 01:20:13.218
We can talk about it again
when the time is right.

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:17.898
I best get going now, Governor Ares.

01:20:19.938 --> 01:20:22.898
I'll look forward to hearing
your decision, Ertuğrul bey<i>.</i>

01:20:24.578 --> 01:20:26.618
And I'll look forward
to hearing of Gündüz.

01:20:28.858 --> 01:20:29.738
Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:20:32.098 --> 01:20:34.578
It was an honor to meet you.

01:20:48.578 --> 01:20:52.258
Get to work, Niko.
I've dealt with the nasty part.

01:20:52.698 --> 01:20:55.098
The rest is up to you.

01:20:55.698 --> 01:20:58.338
-Prepare accordingly.
-Yes, sir.

01:21:20.698 --> 01:21:22.658
Ertuğrul is obviously playing with you.

01:21:24.098 --> 01:21:27.658
I know, Titan. But it's not one sided.

01:21:28.378 --> 01:21:32.058
I'm playing with him too
and I'll be the winner in the end.

01:22:17.138 --> 01:22:18.938
There is still no news.

01:22:22.818 --> 01:22:25.778
Do you think something
bad has happened, my Bey?

01:22:26.258 --> 01:22:29.058
Wife, think positively!

01:22:33.498 --> 01:22:36.098
-May I come in, my Bey?
-Come in, Kayatekin.

01:22:39.218 --> 01:22:40.138
My Bey.

01:22:41.458 --> 01:22:44.538
Turgut... Turgut is on his way
back to the tribe.

01:22:45.058 --> 01:22:46.178
My God.

01:22:48.778 --> 01:22:50.258
What the hell are you saying?

01:22:52.338 --> 01:22:53.338
Sancar.

01:22:57.218 --> 01:22:58.498
Wait here.

01:23:05.818 --> 01:23:08.778
-Where are the others?
-Where are the other alps?

01:23:31.778 --> 01:23:32.738
Alps!

01:23:35.738 --> 01:23:37.138
Where are our brothers?

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:41.338
What's happened to them?

01:23:41.778 --> 01:23:44.458
What happened, Chief Alp Turgut?
Did you find Kırca Alp?

01:23:44.618 --> 01:23:47.498
What's happened to our brothers?
Who did this, Chief Alp Turgut?

01:23:48.658 --> 01:23:50.178
They ambushed us.

01:23:51.298 --> 01:23:55.858
They hid their faces.
But... they each got what they deserved.

01:24:01.818 --> 01:24:03.378
Take him to the healing tent.

01:24:30.578 --> 01:24:32.858
Sancar... Sancar!

01:24:34.498 --> 01:24:36.498
-Kayatekin!
-Yes, my Bey?

01:24:37.098 --> 01:24:41.538
-Find out where Sancar is, right away.
-Yes, my Bey.

01:24:48.658 --> 01:24:50.098
<i>Turgut!</i>

01:24:50.898 --> 01:24:54.738
<i>Turgut! If you've done anything to my son,</i>

01:24:55.138 --> 01:24:58.858
<i>I swear to God,</i>
<i>I'll rain hell upon you</i>

01:24:59.298 --> 01:25:02.498
<i>and take your head in front of everyone.</i>

01:25:06.498 --> 01:25:08.778
What happened Turgut? Where are the alps<i>?</i>

01:25:12.938 --> 01:25:14.298
We were ambushed.

01:25:15.418 --> 01:25:16.778
Good God.

01:25:19.178 --> 01:25:22.138
Who? Who did this?

01:25:24.298 --> 01:25:25.298
I don't know.

01:25:26.818 --> 01:25:28.338
They looked like bandits.

01:25:30.458 --> 01:25:31.938
They hid their faces.

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:42.818
First Kırca, and now this ambush.
For God's sake, what's going on, Turgut?

01:25:45.738 --> 01:25:47.778
Whoever ambushed us...

01:25:51.098 --> 01:25:53.298
knew I'd be there.

01:25:56.418 --> 01:25:57.858
I suspect Bahadir.

01:25:59.618 --> 01:26:02.858
It might not have been Bahadir Bey<i>.</i>

01:26:05.538 --> 01:26:07.818
I got news from the Kayi Tribe today.

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:10.458
Ertuğrul Bey's son, Gündüz...

01:26:12.978 --> 01:26:14.458
What about Gündüz?

01:26:17.058 --> 01:26:18.698
Gündüz has been kidnapped.

01:26:20.218 --> 01:26:21.218
Who?

01:26:23.258 --> 01:26:24.658
Who kidnapped him?

01:26:26.858 --> 01:26:28.778
I can think of only one person.

01:26:36.498 --> 01:26:37.658
Governor Ares.

01:26:38.098 --> 01:26:41.298
He might also be the one
who had you ambushed.

01:27:00.658 --> 01:27:04.378
Go to Ertuğrul Bey if you like.
Don't leave him alone.

01:27:05.178 --> 01:27:06.858
Don't worry about us here.

01:27:07.298 --> 01:27:11.058
I've taken more precautions and increased
the guards. Nothing bad will happen.

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:18.218
I feel like I'm drowning in rage.

01:27:19.778 --> 01:27:24.658
But... it's still dangerous here.

01:27:25.698 --> 01:27:29.898
If I leave here, they'll look
to take advantage of my absence.

01:27:30.698 --> 01:27:32.258
This is where I must be.

01:27:41.618 --> 01:27:45.578
God willing, Ertuğrul Bey will
save his son without my help.

01:27:46.738 --> 01:27:47.738
I hope so.

01:28:07.738 --> 01:28:11.898
<i>Gündüz is alive and in the castle.</i>
<i>I'll locate him as soon as possible.</i>

01:28:12.058 --> 01:28:14.058
<i>Wait for me</i>
<i>in the empty shop, Ertuğrul Bey.</i>

01:28:44.698 --> 01:28:45.978
Gündüz is in the castle.

01:28:48.498 --> 01:28:49.898
Where is the empty shop?

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:52.538
-Let me take you there, my Bey.
-Not now.

01:28:53.818 --> 01:28:55.978
They must see us leave the castle.

01:28:57.658 --> 01:29:00.058
We'll come back in disguise.

01:29:01.818 --> 01:29:02.898
Come on.

01:29:30.338 --> 01:29:31.338
Come.

01:29:34.658 --> 01:29:35.658
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:29:46.898 --> 01:29:52.218
My brave son was going to go
hunting on wild horses.

01:29:54.898 --> 01:29:58.498
He was to ride horses and win battles.

01:30:00.058 --> 01:30:04.698
He will still do those things,
Halime Hatun. Try not to worry.

01:30:05.498 --> 01:30:11.258
I'd give my life to hold you
in my arms one more time, son.

01:30:16.018 --> 01:30:18.618
There are signs of him everywhere, Hafsa.

01:30:20.258 --> 01:30:22.538
Wherever I look, I see him.

01:30:24.298 --> 01:30:26.178
I'm dying inside.

01:30:27.858 --> 01:30:31.098
Halime Hatun, be patient, for God's sake.

01:30:32.218 --> 01:30:36.018
You'll see, Ertuğrul Bey
will come back with Gündüz.

01:30:37.618 --> 01:30:40.978
I hope so. I hope so, Hafsa.

01:31:16.892 --> 01:31:19.492
My mother must be crying a lot
at the marquee, Marya.

01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:22.372
You will soon get back to your tribe.

01:31:22.612 --> 01:31:24.492
Ares will not let me go.

01:31:25.252 --> 01:31:28.372
Weren't you an alp? Do alps surrender?

01:31:28.652 --> 01:31:32.172
Ertuğrul Bey's son, Gündüz,
never surrenders.

01:31:32.412 --> 01:31:33.532
Good for you.

01:31:33.972 --> 01:31:38.572
People sometimes do things they don't
believe in, but for good reason.

01:31:39.492 --> 01:31:41.852
You must be nice to Ares.

01:31:43.532 --> 01:31:45.532
Why are you helping me?

01:31:47.132 --> 01:31:49.292
Because you remind me of my brother.

01:31:49.932 --> 01:31:51.372
What happened to him?

01:31:53.372 --> 01:31:55.252
Some merciless people killed him.

01:31:57.572 --> 01:32:00.052
But I won't let anything happen to you.

01:32:00.612 --> 01:32:04.892
When I get out of here,
I will avenge your brother too.

01:32:18.372 --> 01:32:20.812
I have to go now. I will come back later.

01:32:21.252 --> 01:32:22.372
Eat your food.

01:32:31.612 --> 01:32:34.172
My God, let my father come and rescue me.

01:32:35.172 --> 01:32:37.612
Don't let my mother
and Grandmother worry too much.

01:33:30.612 --> 01:33:32.332
Let me see your face, Günküt.

01:33:37.092 --> 01:33:38.052
Good, good.

01:33:42.292 --> 01:33:43.812
Let me take a look, Bamsi.

01:33:47.812 --> 01:33:48.652
Bamsi?

01:34:10.212 --> 01:34:11.172
Put down your hands.

01:34:24.892 --> 01:34:25.972
Well, would you look at my alp.

01:34:27.532 --> 01:34:31.652
Why do you laugh so heartedly?
Look at your own moustache.

01:34:32.732 --> 01:34:35.452
I'm not ashamed of my moustache
that I would hide it like you.

01:34:35.772 --> 01:34:36.652
Günküt!

01:34:37.452 --> 01:34:40.532
You know I cut off
the tips of that moustache before.

01:34:41.452 --> 01:34:45.692
When this is over,
I'm going to pull them out one by one.

01:34:45.812 --> 01:34:47.332
One by one!

01:34:47.412 --> 01:34:48.772
That's enough, Bamsi.

01:34:49.892 --> 01:34:51.652
You both shaved like you're meant to.

01:34:54.652 --> 01:34:56.892
You have its roots. It will grow back.

01:34:57.532 --> 01:34:58.772
I hope so, my Bey.

01:34:59.092 --> 01:35:00.732
I hope it grows back in no time.

01:35:01.732 --> 01:35:03.172
It will Bamsi, God willing.

01:35:03.772 --> 01:35:04.932
Come on, to the horses.

01:35:05.172 --> 01:35:06.012
My Bey.

01:35:07.772 --> 01:35:11.412
What will Hafsa Hatun say
when she sees me like this?

01:35:12.092 --> 01:35:15.772
I fear she might frown
until it grows back.

01:35:16.852 --> 01:35:18.972
You're going to go back to the tribe
looking like that.

01:35:19.212 --> 01:35:22.892
And you're the head alp.
They will see you like this.

01:35:23.132 --> 01:35:24.572
That should be your main concern.

01:35:29.372 --> 01:35:32.772
You cut your beard for our duty.

01:35:33.572 --> 01:35:37.652
For our duty, we always do
what is necessary without considering

01:35:37.972 --> 01:35:40.332
what others might think, right?

01:35:40.692 --> 01:35:43.372
Right, my Bey.
Duty is what matters the most.

01:35:45.652 --> 01:35:47.092
Good for you, my man.

01:35:48.132 --> 01:35:50.452
-To the horses.
-All right.

01:36:01.412 --> 01:36:03.132
<i>My God, help me.</i>

01:36:04.332 --> 01:36:05.652
<i>Please.</i>

01:36:07.492 --> 01:36:10.132
Marya, is the kid all right?

01:36:15.252 --> 01:36:17.412
He is so small, Commander Kostas.

01:36:18.412 --> 01:36:21.852
Don't be weak, Marya.
He is very valuable to us.

01:36:23.492 --> 01:36:24.572
Don't worry.

01:36:52.372 --> 01:36:56.172
Oh, Sancar. You couldn't kill that dog.

01:36:58.812 --> 01:37:00.892
I hope your life is safe.

01:37:01.012 --> 01:37:03.172
My Bey... Calm down, my Bey.

01:37:03.732 --> 01:37:05.892
If anything had happened,
Turgut would've said something.

01:37:06.172 --> 01:37:08.372
<i>-Permission to enter, my Bey.</i>
-Come in.

01:37:12.372 --> 01:37:15.452
My Bey. Sancar Bey...

01:37:16.212 --> 01:37:17.572
he is wounded.

01:37:20.732 --> 01:37:21.572
Wounded?

01:37:24.852 --> 01:37:25.852
Is he all right?

01:37:27.292 --> 01:37:29.812
They dressed his wounds, my Bey.
He is all right for now.

01:37:31.772 --> 01:37:32.972
My God.

01:37:36.972 --> 01:37:39.532
And Turgut?

01:37:40.612 --> 01:37:42.212
Did Turgut see his face?

01:37:42.412 --> 01:37:43.532
He did not, my Bey.

01:37:43.852 --> 01:37:44.932
He did not.

01:37:48.732 --> 01:37:49.972
There, my Bey.

01:37:50.092 --> 01:37:53.332
Sancar Bey is all right.
And Turgut didn't see who he was.

01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:04.932
Hatun, do you think these things
are so easy?

01:38:05.932 --> 01:38:10.292
Even if they didn't see Sancar's face,
they will suspect us.

01:38:11.332 --> 01:38:13.652
They will be watching us.

01:38:16.172 --> 01:38:17.452
They might even...

01:38:20.692 --> 01:38:23.092
make a move against us.

01:38:26.412 --> 01:38:28.452
We didn't get what we hoped for.

01:38:30.852 --> 01:38:37.252
Now we must do whatever we can
so they do not to suspect us.

01:38:40.252 --> 01:38:44.012
That's why I am going to visit
Aslıhan and Turgut.

01:38:48.652 --> 01:38:53.572
Then I will go see Sancar
without anyone knowing.

01:39:20.092 --> 01:39:21.772
Somebody is coming. Get ready.

01:39:31.212 --> 01:39:32.212
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:39:33.052 --> 01:39:35.692
Ares' courtesan Marya knows
where they are keeping Gündüz.

01:39:36.572 --> 01:39:38.372
Bamsi Alp, you were right.

01:39:39.052 --> 01:39:40.652
What you said was useful. Thank you.

01:39:41.372 --> 01:39:42.452
You're welcome.

01:39:43.852 --> 01:39:45.972
You keeping your eye out helped us, Bamsi.

01:39:46.492 --> 01:39:49.172
You once again proved
that you deserve to be head alp.

01:39:50.372 --> 01:39:52.212
Thank you, my Bey. Thank you.

01:39:54.012 --> 01:39:55.612
Then we talk to Marya.

01:39:55.852 --> 01:39:58.972
I found Marya's quarters, my Bey.
We can go right away.

01:40:00.892 --> 01:40:02.652
Only Bamsi will come with us.

01:40:03.652 --> 01:40:05.972
With God's grace,
if we get Gündüz and get out...

01:40:06.652 --> 01:40:08.052
we will be out of the fort

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:09.732
before the doors are opened.

01:40:10.452 --> 01:40:12.012
And the next time we go there...

01:40:12.532 --> 01:40:14.492
it will be to conquer the fort
with God's permission.

01:40:15.052 --> 01:40:16.852
Hopefully, my Bey.

01:40:18.052 --> 01:40:19.092
You...

01:40:19.932 --> 01:40:21.972
lie in wait at the market and the gates.

01:40:22.092 --> 01:40:25.452
-As you wish, my Bey.
-Give us your blessing, men.

01:40:25.572 --> 01:40:27.852
-It is yours.
-It is yours, my Bey.

01:40:28.372 --> 01:40:29.772
I hope you come with your son.

01:40:31.132 --> 01:40:32.092
Thank you.

01:41:01.572 --> 01:41:03.132
<i>Permission to enter.</i>

01:41:11.772 --> 01:41:12.892
Come in.

01:41:23.812 --> 01:41:25.132
<i>Selamunaleykum</i>.

01:41:38.172 --> 01:41:39.332
<i>Aleykumselamun</i>.

01:41:40.812 --> 01:41:42.052
Why have you come, Bahadir Bey?

01:41:45.932 --> 01:41:48.492
You were eating, apologies.

01:41:50.332 --> 01:41:51.252
However...

01:41:52.012 --> 01:41:53.492
I heard something.

01:41:54.532 --> 01:41:57.292
Ertuğrul Bey's son was kidnapped.

01:42:04.012 --> 01:42:05.092
He was.

01:42:05.972 --> 01:42:06.932
However...

01:42:07.892 --> 01:42:11.532
our bey will retrieve Gündüz
in one piece, sooner or later.

01:42:12.212 --> 01:42:13.812
Hopefully.

01:42:15.372 --> 01:42:18.212
If there is anything I can do
to aid you in this...

01:42:18.612 --> 01:42:21.292
I am ready to do it,
that is what I came to say.

01:42:31.532 --> 01:42:33.052
Thank you, Bahadir Bey.

01:42:33.612 --> 01:42:35.092
There is no need for now.

01:42:39.492 --> 01:42:40.772
There might have been...

01:42:42.132 --> 01:42:45.212
some unpleasant dealings among us.

01:42:46.652 --> 01:42:47.572
But...

01:42:47.972 --> 01:42:51.372
a boy's life it at stake here.

01:42:52.532 --> 01:42:53.852
In situations like this...

01:42:54.972 --> 01:42:56.772
hostilities are left behind.

01:42:58.212 --> 01:43:00.332
If there is anything I can do...

01:43:01.132 --> 01:43:02.492
I will be in my tent.

01:43:08.372 --> 01:43:09.532
Good night.

01:43:14.932 --> 01:43:15.972
Thank you.

01:43:23.612 --> 01:43:24.572
Door.

01:43:45.092 --> 01:43:47.012
By kidnapping Ertuğrul's boy...

01:43:47.612 --> 01:43:49.852
we have greatly shaken
Ertuğrul and the Turks.

01:43:50.612 --> 01:43:53.172
We will continue to do so until they fall.

01:43:53.772 --> 01:43:55.572
Up next is Bahadir Bey.

01:43:56.132 --> 01:43:59.652
We will pull him into our ranks
and help him to get his tribe back.

01:44:01.612 --> 01:44:03.452
Ertuğrul will not like that at all.

01:44:05.052 --> 01:44:07.292
And it will cause a stir among the Turks.

01:44:07.492 --> 01:44:09.412
That's exactly what I want.

01:44:10.532 --> 01:44:12.732
Then it's up to you, Titan.

01:44:16.492 --> 01:44:17.332
What is?

01:44:18.092 --> 01:44:19.972
Call your men, get them here.

01:44:22.092 --> 01:44:24.932
We will watch what goes on among the Turks
from here.

01:44:25.132 --> 01:44:26.532
We will make our moves accordingly.

01:44:28.452 --> 01:44:31.012
I hope these moves
turn into big slaughters.

01:44:31.452 --> 01:44:32.852
They definitely will.

01:44:33.492 --> 01:44:36.332
When they start fighting among themselves
we will destroy them all.

01:44:37.372 --> 01:44:39.092
You don't have to worry about us.

01:44:39.892 --> 01:44:43.172
Me and my men
have been longing to shed Turkish blood.

01:44:43.332 --> 01:44:44.732
Just tell us

01:44:44.812 --> 01:44:46.852
when, where and what to do.

01:44:47.972 --> 01:44:48.932
Then...

01:44:49.412 --> 01:44:50.852
get on your walls...

01:44:51.372 --> 01:44:54.052
and watch the blood
that flows from Turk camps with pleasure.

01:45:01.532 --> 01:45:04.612
To our holy empire and cause.

01:45:29.852 --> 01:45:31.252
Here, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:46:04.052 --> 01:46:05.092
Who is it?

01:46:05.172 --> 01:46:06.692
Tekfur Ares sent me.

01:46:12.212 --> 01:46:13.292
What do you want?

01:46:23.732 --> 01:46:24.852
Marya.

01:46:25.692 --> 01:46:27.212
What are you up to?

01:46:29.092 --> 01:46:30.572
What do you mean?

01:46:31.372 --> 01:46:34.492
I know you have been
secretly talking to Ertuğrul's alps.

01:46:36.852 --> 01:46:38.172
You are out of your mind.

01:46:39.172 --> 01:46:41.932
Why did you tell them that you were...

01:46:42.852 --> 01:46:44.372
working for that dog Simko?

01:46:45.412 --> 01:46:47.292
What are you after, Marya?

01:46:47.492 --> 01:46:48.772
Talk to me.

01:46:50.052 --> 01:46:52.252
You came here uninvited. Get out!

01:46:55.892 --> 01:46:57.972
Ares will punish you.

01:47:04.092 --> 01:47:05.452
I don't think so.

01:47:06.252 --> 01:47:09.532
Ares will kill you
if he finds out that you have been

01:47:09.652 --> 01:47:11.732
whispering into alps' ears,
you know that right?

01:47:14.412 --> 01:47:15.412
Tell me.

01:47:16.412 --> 01:47:18.132
Why did you talk to the alps?

01:47:18.332 --> 01:47:19.732
Either you talk now...

01:47:21.052 --> 01:47:23.612
or I will tell Ares what I know.

01:47:23.692 --> 01:47:24.772
Come on.

01:47:26.532 --> 01:47:28.492
God damn you all!

01:47:31.372 --> 01:47:35.652
He will kill that innocent boy
just like he killed my brother.

01:47:37.292 --> 01:47:40.052
Enough, I can't take it anymore.

01:47:40.652 --> 01:47:41.812
Damn you...

01:47:42.452 --> 01:47:45.612
and that scum that is your lord!

01:47:47.732 --> 01:47:48.692
Yes.

01:47:49.892 --> 01:47:50.852
Damn him.

01:48:00.332 --> 01:48:01.652
Ertuğrul Bey!

01:48:03.292 --> 01:48:04.532
Where is my son, Marya?

01:48:07.772 --> 01:48:09.892
God has answered my prayers.

01:48:12.092 --> 01:48:13.572
I will take you to him.

01:48:14.892 --> 01:48:17.092
Just avenge my brother.

01:48:53.372 --> 01:48:54.212
Halime Hatun!

01:48:54.932 --> 01:48:55.892
Hafsa!

01:48:56.012 --> 01:48:59.532
I asked the alps,
still no word from Ertuğrul Bey.

01:49:02.772 --> 01:49:03.732
Mother...

01:49:04.612 --> 01:49:06.412
Still no word.

01:49:06.732 --> 01:49:09.412
How will I live
if something happened to Gündüz?

01:49:10.932 --> 01:49:12.652
My girl, my beautiful girl...

01:49:12.892 --> 01:49:14.572
hope for the best.

01:49:14.812 --> 01:49:17.132
My Ertuğrul will find him
and bring him to you.

01:49:17.532 --> 01:49:18.852
Don't you lose hope.

01:49:21.412 --> 01:49:22.932
You are right, mother.

01:49:23.412 --> 01:49:25.812
What can I say,
I can't make my heart listen.

01:49:26.772 --> 01:49:29.492
My Ertuğrul and my Gündüz
are at that forsaken fort.

01:49:30.972 --> 01:49:33.652
Every minute they don't return,
It eats me up inside.

01:49:34.252 --> 01:49:36.412
God willing,
they will return in one piece.

01:49:36.932 --> 01:49:38.852
You need to be strong.

01:49:39.292 --> 01:49:40.692
Trust in God.

01:49:41.132 --> 01:49:42.172
Okay?

01:49:42.772 --> 01:49:43.612
Okay?

01:49:43.692 --> 01:49:44.852
My dear God...

01:49:45.892 --> 01:49:49.252
please let them return to the tribe
in one piece.

01:49:50.172 --> 01:49:52.372
God willing. God help us.

01:50:00.612 --> 01:50:01.572
This way.

01:50:03.532 --> 01:50:07.452
Ares asked me to look after Gündüz
at night. He won't call for me.

01:50:08.212 --> 01:50:12.012
He doesn't want anyone to know that Gündüz
is at the fort. He increased security.

01:50:13.892 --> 01:50:15.372
Where are the guards, Marya?

01:50:15.452 --> 01:50:16.892
There are two at the door.

01:50:16.972 --> 01:50:19.452
And his special guards are on patrol,

01:50:20.052 --> 01:50:22.652
his best warriors,
the soldiers who are closest to Ares.

01:50:23.092 --> 01:50:24.532
Be careful.

01:50:24.612 --> 01:50:26.092
-Bamsi.
-Yes.

01:50:26.172 --> 01:50:27.412
I will go with Marya.

01:50:28.092 --> 01:50:30.772
Watch out for the guards, watch my back.

01:50:31.092 --> 01:50:32.972
Yes, my Bey. Yes.

01:50:33.052 --> 01:50:35.972
Do not engage with them unless necessary.

01:50:38.412 --> 01:50:39.532
Let's go, Marya.

01:51:04.292 --> 01:51:06.692
Tekfur Ares wants to see the boy
right away.

01:51:10.932 --> 01:51:12.092
Who is this?

01:51:50.852 --> 01:51:51.932
Gündüz...

01:52:09.892 --> 01:52:11.012
Father!

01:52:12.652 --> 01:52:14.212
Am I dreaming?

01:52:14.292 --> 01:52:15.732
It is not a dream, my boy.

01:52:16.292 --> 01:52:18.412
I came to take you home.

01:52:29.092 --> 01:52:32.092
You taught me
that a Turk doesn't surrender,

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:33.692
and I never did.

01:52:34.092 --> 01:52:35.279
I did not bring disgrace upon you.

01:52:35.652 --> 01:52:37.252
Well done, my boy.

01:52:39.252 --> 01:52:40.412
Ertuğrul Bey,

01:52:40.892 --> 01:52:43.212
the sun is about to rise,
the gates will be opened. Hurry.

01:52:44.092 --> 01:52:45.172
all right.

01:52:45.652 --> 01:52:46.812
Come on, my boy.

01:52:49.812 --> 01:52:51.212
This is yours from now on.

01:52:51.652 --> 01:52:53.892
Take it. You deserve it.

01:52:54.332 --> 01:52:55.732
Protect yourself if need be.

01:52:57.452 --> 01:52:58.972
This is the day, father.

01:52:59.132 --> 01:53:00.852
If enemies should befall me

01:53:00.932 --> 01:53:04.172
I will hit my first one with this.

01:53:04.412 --> 01:53:05.892
You will, my boy.

01:53:06.892 --> 01:53:08.212
You will.

01:53:19.212 --> 01:53:20.332
Come.

01:53:21.812 --> 01:53:23.492
Alert Tekfur Ares.

01:53:23.652 --> 01:53:24.892
Ertuğrul is in the fort.

01:53:24.972 --> 01:53:26.452
<i>Ya Allah!</i>

01:54:05.492 --> 01:54:07.132
Marya! Are you all right?

01:54:10.532 --> 01:54:11.772
Are you all right, Marya?

01:54:16.132 --> 01:54:17.052
I'm fine.

01:54:17.652 --> 01:54:18.852
Ertuğrul Bey,

01:54:19.452 --> 01:54:20.892
You go.

01:54:21.452 --> 01:54:22.292
I...

01:54:22.932 --> 01:54:24.692
I will take care of myself.

01:54:26.492 --> 01:54:27.732
Avenge...

01:54:28.012 --> 01:54:29.492
my brother.

01:54:29.732 --> 01:54:31.452
I give you my word, Marya.

01:54:32.292 --> 01:54:33.892
I will avenge your brother.

01:54:36.492 --> 01:54:37.652
Come on, son.

01:55:26.692 --> 01:55:32.212
<i>The light of my dark eye</i>

01:55:36.172 --> 01:55:40.732
<i>Atop the mountain that lies dark ahead</i>

01:55:41.852 --> 01:55:43.732
<i>My son</i>

01:55:47.012 --> 01:55:52.892
<i>May your wings never break</i>

01:55:55.172 --> 01:56:01.572
<i>May your rivers never run dry</i>

01:56:10.372 --> 01:56:12.092
Mighty Lord,

01:56:12.252 --> 01:56:16.012
for the sake of the prophet Muhammed...

01:56:16.732 --> 01:56:19.012
please spare my Gündüz.

01:56:20.572 --> 01:56:21.812
Spare him.

01:56:40.972 --> 01:56:43.052
My dear God, help us.

01:56:55.812 --> 01:56:56.932
God damn it!

01:56:57.892 --> 01:56:59.292
What happened here?

01:57:03.412 --> 01:57:04.412
Marya!

01:57:08.292 --> 01:57:09.132
Marya!

01:57:10.932 --> 01:57:13.692
She's hurt! Send for the healer at once!

01:57:17.292 --> 01:57:18.292
Gündüz!

01:57:30.412 --> 01:57:33.292
We need to pass the soldiers at the gates
before the ones in the fort come.

01:57:33.372 --> 01:57:34.372
Come on.

01:57:37.412 --> 01:57:38.852
Alert all the guards!

01:57:38.932 --> 01:57:40.452
Hold all the gates! Hurry!

01:57:51.812 --> 01:57:53.372
-What's going on, Niko?
-Not Niko.

01:57:53.772 --> 01:57:54.972
Atsız!

01:58:04.252 --> 01:58:06.172
Hide my boy, hide!

01:58:06.412 --> 01:58:08.012
Protect yourself, Gündüz!

01:59:24.932 --> 01:59:25.812
Kostas.

01:59:26.852 --> 01:59:30.692
All the wine I've drunk since morning
has not eased the pain.

01:59:33.012 --> 01:59:35.092
Give me some good news
that may help.

01:59:36.852 --> 01:59:37.972
My lord...

01:59:38.812 --> 01:59:40.292
They took Gündüz.

01:59:49.732 --> 01:59:51.212
What do you mean, they took him?

01:59:51.332 --> 01:59:52.572
What are you saying?

01:59:52.652 --> 01:59:55.532
My lord,
they killed the men in the hallway.

01:59:56.692 --> 01:59:58.852
I ran to the dungeon but...

01:59:59.372 --> 02:00:00.532
he wasn't there.

02:00:02.772 --> 02:00:05.412
Have you lost your mind,
what are you saying?

02:00:05.532 --> 02:00:06.812
Where is Marya?

02:00:06.972 --> 02:00:09.492
Marya is wounded, my lord.
They took her to her room.

02:00:15.412 --> 02:00:17.572
Ertuğrul has come to save his son.

02:00:18.812 --> 02:00:20.172
Close the gates.

02:00:20.292 --> 02:00:22.332
Alert the men, don't let them out.

02:00:22.492 --> 02:00:24.692
Why are you just standing there, go!

02:00:26.532 --> 02:00:27.652
Door.

02:00:38.292 --> 02:00:39.332
Ertuğrul!

02:00:40.572 --> 02:00:42.852
I will not let you win this time...

02:00:44.052 --> 02:00:46.452
no matter the cost.

02:01:09.132 --> 02:01:10.012
Father!

02:01:31.852 --> 02:01:33.012
Come, son.

02:01:33.292 --> 02:01:34.252
Come on.

02:01:45.812 --> 02:01:47.092
Thank you.

02:01:55.532 --> 02:01:57.692
I told you if Ertuğrul leaves, he wins.

02:01:58.132 --> 02:01:58.972
I can't let that happen.

02:01:59.332 --> 02:02:01.652
Run to the gates, don't let them out.

02:02:56.452 --> 02:02:58.332
They penetrated
the deepest corners of my fort,

02:02:59.412 --> 02:03:01.332
killed my men and left.

02:03:03.172 --> 02:03:05.492
Ertuğrul will pay for this.

02:03:06.332 --> 02:03:07.852
Ertuğrul broke the peace, Ares.

02:03:08.292 --> 02:03:09.892
Goddamn the peace!

02:03:10.652 --> 02:03:12.052
It is time for blood!

02:03:12.732 --> 02:03:13.812
Close the gates!

02:03:14.492 --> 02:03:16.372
No one goes out!

02:03:16.932 --> 02:03:18.772
The war with the Turks has begun!

02:04:09.092 --> 02:04:11.252
Yah!

02:04:49.212 --> 02:04:50.492
My girl...

02:04:51.012 --> 02:04:53.172
My girl, this is eating you up.

02:04:54.132 --> 02:04:55.452
Come, sit a little.

02:04:57.492 --> 02:04:59.012
How can I sit, mother?

02:04:59.212 --> 02:05:00.732
There's still no word.

02:05:01.732 --> 02:05:04.212
I cannot stay sat in this tent.

02:05:04.732 --> 02:05:07.532
I cannot rest until my Ertuğrul
and my Gündüz are back.

02:05:13.892 --> 02:05:15.532
My dear God,

02:05:15.612 --> 02:05:18.052
let them come to their tribe in one piece.

02:05:26.692 --> 02:05:27.972
The kettledrum.

02:05:28.092 --> 02:05:30.092
I hope they're signaling good news.

02:05:30.612 --> 02:05:31.732
God willing.

02:05:34.052 --> 02:05:35.612
My God.

02:05:37.212 --> 02:05:38.492
My God.

02:06:09.772 --> 02:06:14.132
Ertuğrul Bey brings Gündüz!

02:06:29.212 --> 02:06:32.132
Rejoice, Ertuğrul Bey is back.

02:06:46.932 --> 02:06:48.052
Gündüz!

02:06:49.452 --> 02:06:50.852
Gündüz! My son!

02:06:51.132 --> 02:06:52.812
Ertuğrul Bey is back!

02:07:09.132 --> 02:07:10.612
Welcome, my Bey.

02:07:17.252 --> 02:07:18.852
Mother, I'm back.

02:07:20.452 --> 02:07:22.292
Welcome, my Gündüz.

02:07:40.172 --> 02:07:41.492
My Gündüz.

02:07:48.012 --> 02:07:49.532
You are all right, aren't you?

02:07:49.652 --> 02:07:51.692
Those fiends didn't do anything to you,
did they?

02:07:52.092 --> 02:07:55.452
Don't worry, Mother,
your son made them sorry.

02:08:00.372 --> 02:08:01.772
Good for you.

02:08:01.972 --> 02:08:03.052
My Gündüz.

02:08:03.812 --> 02:08:04.932
Grandmother.

02:08:05.532 --> 02:08:06.852
I'd die for you.

02:08:09.492 --> 02:08:10.892
Oh, my dear.

02:08:11.572 --> 02:08:12.932
Oh, my dearest.

02:08:17.212 --> 02:08:18.372
Ertuğrul.

02:08:20.452 --> 02:08:22.332
Oh, my dear.

02:08:37.492 --> 02:08:38.692
Welcome.

02:08:38.772 --> 02:08:40.092
It's nice to be back.

02:08:45.172 --> 02:08:46.572
My Gündüz.

02:08:47.052 --> 02:08:48.212
I'd die for you.

02:08:49.092 --> 02:08:50.212
My son.

02:08:50.452 --> 02:08:52.132
God bless you.

02:08:52.652 --> 02:08:54.652
You gave us the joy of reunion.

02:08:57.132 --> 02:08:59.012
I was burning up inside, my Bey.

02:09:00.092 --> 02:09:02.492
But now that I see you in one piece...

02:09:03.292 --> 02:09:05.732
I wouldn't be sad even if the world fell.

02:09:06.172 --> 02:09:07.812
You gave me the biggest of joys.

02:09:08.652 --> 02:09:10.972
From now on, the fire in your heart
will subside, Halime.

02:09:13.252 --> 02:09:14.972
Their fire will begin.

02:09:20.892 --> 02:09:22.052
The enemy...

02:09:23.212 --> 02:09:26.372
can take nothing from us with traps.

02:09:27.172 --> 02:09:30.452
To the fiends
who rage to rid us of these lands...

02:09:31.732 --> 02:09:33.372
we have no son to give them.

02:09:34.172 --> 02:09:36.132
We have not an inch of land to give them.

02:09:38.132 --> 02:09:40.732
Evil has revealed its face.

02:09:41.612 --> 02:09:46.252
Conquest has become necessary
to keep order.

02:09:47.052 --> 02:09:50.092
From now on, swords will be drawn...

02:09:52.212 --> 02:09:54.532
and until the order of evil
is destroyed...

02:09:55.172 --> 02:09:57.652
they will not be put away.

02:09:57.812 --> 02:10:01.332
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

02:10:03.172 --> 02:10:08.172
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

02:10:12.972 --> 02:10:18.252
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>
