1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
episode 104 will start after 12:35 min.

2
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,247
It's possible to conquer everything
by the sword.

3
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:57,647
But what matters is to be able
to call it home.

4
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:05,007
We must make this place our home
and ensure peace for the Christians.

5
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,647
You're absolutely right, sir.

6
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:13,207
First, we must build a mosque
as the symbol of being owned by Islam.

7
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,487
Get it done, Bamsı.

8
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:21,647
Have the best artisans do it.
Buy whatever we need.

9
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:23,007
As you wish, sir.

10
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:26,607
Sir, from now on,
scholars will be visiting our home.

11
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:31,087
We need to build a place
for them, a madrasah.

12
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:33,847
Good thinking, Artuk Bey.

13
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:39,567
Education is the basis
for a prosperous home.

14
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:43,047
We must attract scholars,

15
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,887
and make sure they stay here,
if need be.

16
00:13:46,047 --> 00:13:48,647
Sir, we can use the artisans we brought

17
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:54,007
to build an almshouse for the poor
and infirmaries for the sick.

18
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,767
The biggest concern
of the Christians is tax.

19
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:03,567
They've been crushed
under the harsh Byzantine tax for a while.

20
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:11,207
And now they are afraid
of what taxes we'll ask of them.

21
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,367
What do you think about this, Artuk Bey?

22
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,527
Sir, our tradition dictates

23
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:21,687
that a bey is the one who gives,
and the brave are those who are strong.

24
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:27,127
Based on this, their bellies must be full
and their sacks filled with coins,

25
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,207
to live in peace.

26
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:31,687
If the people live in peace,

27
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:36,047
then they will be loyal to their ruler
and comply with him.

28
00:14:36,447 --> 00:14:38,167
I thought so, Artuk Bey.

29
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,247
That's why we must keep

30
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,647
the taxes we'll be taking
from the Christian tradesmen to a minimum.

31
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:46,447
Abdur Rahman.

32
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,727
Go out and gather the Greek.

33
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,807
Let them know that the taxes
are going to be minimal.

34
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:54,967
As you wish, sir.

35
00:15:00,807 --> 00:15:01,807
Artuk Bey.

36
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:06,487
Before all else, check the documents
we found here.

37
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:13,167
Surely, something that connects
Emir Sadettin and Ares will show up.

38
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:15,407
Check everything in detail.

39
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:17,367
This is important.

40
00:15:17,487 --> 00:15:18,847
As you wish, sir.

41
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:22,567
I shall go to the cellar now.
Ares' confidential documents are there.

42
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:23,887
All right.

43
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:26,287
Take Marya with you.

44
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,727
She'll help you read
the documents in Greek.

45
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:31,007
As you wish, sir.

46
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:11,872
Come in.

47
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:16,632
This is the last room.

48
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:22,352
This room has the best scenery
in the fortress.

49
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:26,632
So, it was used mostly to rest
or to host our guests overnight.

50
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:39,112
This great fortress belongs to you now.

51
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,032
You can arrange everything to your liking.

52
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:04,872
Oh, Suleyman Shah.

53
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:11,472
I wish you were alive...

54
00:17:13,272 --> 00:17:15,112
to see this great day.

55
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:29,752
Oh my God!

56
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,712
Oh my God!

57
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:36,352
-Mother?
-Mother Hayme?

58
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,032
What's wrong?

59
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:42,032
-Help her!
-Give us a hand.

60
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:50,432
Mother, are you okay?

61
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:53,752
Hafsa Hatun, call Artuk Bey.

62
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:55,672
Come, my dear.

63
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:58,392
Wait. Don't go.

64
00:17:58,832 --> 00:17:59,832
I'm okay.

65
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:02,992
It's passed.

66
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:04,472
What do you mean you are okay?

67
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:08,232
You were out of breath.
Let Artuk Bey check on you.

68
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:11,872
There's no need, dear.

69
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,712
See, I'm okay.

70
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:20,272
It's just... old age.

71
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:22,992
This much is normal.

72
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,072
-Halime.
-Yes, Mother?

73
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,592
This is an ephemeral world.

74
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:36,072
If something happens to me...

75
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:42,232
make sure that Dündar comes back
to your brother.

76
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:52,472
Keep your brothers together.

77
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:59,032
Don't let them be hostile to each other.

78
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:01,312
Look out for them.

79
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,792
Don't say that, Mother.

80
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:06,312
You will stay with us.
Don't speak like that.

81
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:09,712
Dear.

82
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:13,792
Fate will knock on my door as well.

83
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:18,072
Tomorrow, if not today.

84
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:30,152
Marya Hatun.

85
00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:33,872
Ertuğrul Bey wants you to check documents
in the cellar with Artuk Bey.

86
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:37,192
Excuse me.

87
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:42,552
Take care of yourself, Mother Hayme.

88
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,632
Thanks, dear.

89
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:47,952
God bless you.

90
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:02,752
Come on.

91
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:05,152
We have much to do.

92
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:07,152
Let's go.

93
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:08,992
Here, Mother.

94
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:12,552
It's okay.

95
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:15,272
I'm all right.

96
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:42,632
Ares.

97
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:44,272
Titan.

98
00:21:56,672 --> 00:21:58,952
Ertuğrul appeared
as I was waiting for you.

99
00:22:01,312 --> 00:22:03,952
We lost the fortress
due to your foolishness.

100
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:18,192
If your men holding the secret passage
had been alert,

101
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:19,792
we wouldn’t have ended up like this.

102
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,672
Don't you try to blame others
for your mistake.

103
00:22:23,032 --> 00:22:24,832
We ended up like this because of you.

104
00:22:32,312 --> 00:22:33,312
You are wounded.

105
00:22:34,432 --> 00:22:35,632
My wound is unimportant.

106
00:22:36,912 --> 00:22:38,432
To hell with my wound.

107
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:41,912
I was betrayed by the woman I love.

108
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:44,512
My fortress fell!

109
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,392
The war is not over just yet.

110
00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:01,472
Let's treat your wound.

111
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:05,312
The war is not over.

112
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,552
The war is not over just yet.

113
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:10,832
Not yet.

114
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:18,912
It's not over yet.

115
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:30,552
What's wrong, Abdur Rahman?

116
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:33,832
Ertuğrul Bey told me
not to allow anyone in.

117
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,712
Not even me? Let me pass.

118
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:40,592
Halime Sultan, his orders are absolute.

119
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:43,832
Don't put me in a difficult position.

120
00:23:44,832 --> 00:23:48,072
I'd lay my life down for you,
but I can't let you inside.

121
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:53,632
What's going on in there?

122
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,672
I can't say.

123
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,072
O almighty God.

124
00:24:15,032 --> 00:24:17,712
You are just and merciful.

125
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:20,792
I'm forlorn.

126
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:22,792
I'm helpless.

127
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:25,032
I'm poor.

128
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:29,312
Don't leave me alone
in this mortal life, God.

129
00:24:30,312 --> 00:24:31,312
Look out for me.

130
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:32,952
Grace me with your mercy.

131
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:34,552
Help me.

132
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:39,352
Don't let my heart be
a slave to this throne.

133
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:45,952
Don't let me be one of your subjects,
whose heart is stricken with ambition.

134
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:53,352
I only ask for your mercy
and bow down only to you.

135
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:58,792
Don't let me lose
to the trickeries of evil.

136
00:25:01,472 --> 00:25:05,432
Don't let me be blinded by this world
and forget about the afterlife.

137
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:08,792
I know.

138
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:11,752
Only you grant victory.

139
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:14,392
I know.

140
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:16,872
Only you grant power.

141
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:21,952
I know that only you grant glory.

142
00:25:22,992 --> 00:25:25,872
Don't let me be one of those
who don't know.

143
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,152
Don't let me be an ungrateful believer.

144
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:36,112
Don't let me fall prey to gracelessness.

145
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:42,232
I lay down my life for you.

146
00:25:43,272 --> 00:25:45,432
My people fight for your cause.

147
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:50,752
All I ask is for you
never to leave us alone.

148
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:54,152
Amen.

149
00:25:54,592 --> 00:25:55,992
<i>Al-Haqq.</i>

150
00:27:12,392 --> 00:27:13,752
What happened, Marya Hatun?

151
00:27:14,072 --> 00:27:15,872
Did you find an important document?

152
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:18,592
Sorry, not yet. They are
just ordinary scribbles.

153
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:29,352
Artuk Bey.

154
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,112
You're looking at them very intently.

155
00:27:33,472 --> 00:27:35,672
Are you looking for something specific?

156
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,232
If so, I'll be on the lookout for it.

157
00:27:40,512 --> 00:27:43,232
We are not looking
for a specific document, Marya Hatun.

158
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:45,232
Just keep looking.

159
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,632
Read it to me if you find
an important document.

160
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:50,752
Of course.

161
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:39,832
Men!

162
00:28:41,312 --> 00:28:42,312
Question.

163
00:28:43,992 --> 00:28:49,952
Is this fortress of stone
safer than our tents?

164
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:52,912
Of course, the stone is safer,
Commander Bamsı.

165
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:54,672
What's a tent, anyway?

166
00:28:57,272 --> 00:28:58,992
What about you, everybody?

167
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:03,392
-Günkut is right.
-Yes.

168
00:29:06,592 --> 00:29:07,592
Then...

169
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:09,752
Then, pity me.

170
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:11,392
Pity.

171
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:16,392
I'll have to break a sweat
to nail maturity in you.

172
00:29:18,672 --> 00:29:19,672
Men!

173
00:29:21,032 --> 00:29:24,112
First of all, an alp's safehouse
is his heart.

174
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:27,032
His sword is his mind.

175
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:30,232
Mere stone won't keep you safe
without your heart.

176
00:29:30,872 --> 00:29:33,552
And what good is a sword for a fool?

177
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:37,032
You asked if stone was sturdier
than a tent, Commander Bamsı.

178
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:39,952
Your question and your explanation
have nothing in common.

179
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:42,152
We already know what you mean.

180
00:29:43,592 --> 00:29:47,112
Of course, stone is sturdier
than some rags.

181
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:51,632
However,
those living in those tents made of rags

182
00:29:52,352 --> 00:29:54,752
prevailed over those
hiding behind this fortress.

183
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:58,872
Then, the might of stone
blew up in their face.

184
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:04,112
And you said stone was
stronger than rags?

185
00:30:06,832 --> 00:30:07,832
Everyone!

186
00:30:09,032 --> 00:30:11,872
It all depends on the situation.

187
00:30:12,032 --> 00:30:15,752
An alp must be able
to read between the lines.

188
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:17,232
He must feel it.

189
00:30:18,312 --> 00:30:21,832
He must see the intent
hidden behind faces.

190
00:30:24,552 --> 00:30:26,752
Why do you think we went through
all this trouble?

191
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:30,072
Why was our bey's son Gündüz kidnapped?

192
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:33,632
Why did we lose Doğan Alp?

193
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:35,992
And Samsa Alp...

194
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:38,232
Why was he killed?

195
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,312
It's because we couldn't read the enemy.

196
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:46,472
We couldn't realize
the schemes of the traitors.

197
00:30:47,752 --> 00:30:50,952
That's why you mustn't shake things off
as being just questions.

198
00:30:51,592 --> 00:30:54,912
Try to understand
the hidden meaning underneath.

199
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:00,592
I need soldiers that can see
through what is hidden.

200
00:31:02,072 --> 00:31:04,352
And read the enemy.

201
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:07,832
Men!

202
00:31:09,272 --> 00:31:11,672
If we show weakness,

203
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:14,672
we will just be a burden for Ertuğrul Bey.

204
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:19,992
We know how to take orders,
but we also need to know how to think.

205
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:25,352
Now, every morning and evening

206
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:30,552
I'll teach you how to shake off
the dust on your minds.

207
00:31:32,032 --> 00:31:35,352
-Have I made myself clear?
-Yes, Commander Bamsı.

208
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:40,632
Good.

209
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:51,712
What's your plan?

210
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:55,272
We need to take the fortress back first.

211
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:00,072
I sent a message
to the Governor of Bilecik.

212
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:01,872
He'll send a messenger.

213
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:06,112
He'll make a generous offer.

214
00:32:13,112 --> 00:32:16,312
Do you still think you can fool
Ertuğrul with your offers?

215
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:17,672
Of course, not.

216
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:21,872
But I'll corner him so badly
that he might be tempted...

217
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,752
to take the offer during our bargain.

218
00:32:42,832 --> 00:32:43,832
Are you ready?

219
00:33:36,072 --> 00:33:37,792
Sir, we couldn't find Ares, unfortunately.

220
00:33:39,952 --> 00:33:42,352
So, it's not his time
to die yet, Atsız Bey.

221
00:33:43,032 --> 00:33:44,192
It seems so.

222
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:47,792
This is amazing.

223
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:51,312
We were once slaves.

224
00:33:51,832 --> 00:33:53,712
And now, we own this fortress, Atsız.

225
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,832
May God give you abundance.

226
00:33:56,032 --> 00:33:57,512
May you conquer many others.

227
00:33:58,192 --> 00:34:00,072
May you might be everlasting,
Ertuğrul Bey.

228
00:34:00,632 --> 00:34:02,312
-Amen.
-Thank you.

229
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:04,392
May you live a long life.

230
00:34:05,312 --> 00:34:07,952
We couldn't have done this
without your help, Atsız.

231
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:14,832
Our country wouldn't support you without
your persistence, passion, and dreams.

232
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:16,632
God bless you.

233
00:34:17,832 --> 00:34:19,272
God bless us all.

234
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:20,632
Thank you.

235
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,312
Open the gate!

236
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:38,512
Commander Bamsı.
There's a Byzantine messenger.

237
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:45,832
Good, good.

238
00:34:46,392 --> 00:34:47,592
Take away his weapons.

239
00:34:48,312 --> 00:34:51,072
-They shall wait.
-As you wish, Commander.

240
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:00,512
Take off your weapons.

241
00:35:32,192 --> 00:35:36,072
Welcome to the fortress of Ertuğrul Bey,
bey of the Kayis.

242
00:35:37,592 --> 00:35:40,912
I came to tell Ertuğrul Bey
about the Governor of Bilecik's offer.

243
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:46,032
Who are you?

244
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:52,952
-Angelos, Governor of Bilecik's commander.
-I see.

245
00:35:55,312 --> 00:35:56,952
Well, then.

246
00:35:57,552 --> 00:36:00,432
You shall wait here.

247
00:36:00,832 --> 00:36:03,152
When Ertuğrul Bey is available,

248
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:05,832
and would like to see you,

249
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:07,512
I'll let you see him.

250
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:12,312
Dumrul.

251
00:36:13,232 --> 00:36:16,952
Help our guests with some sherbet.

252
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:18,392
As you wish, Commander.

253
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:20,912
Come on, then.

254
00:36:37,192 --> 00:36:40,432
Ertuğrul Bey, with this,
my mission is over. I'll excuse myself.

255
00:36:42,152 --> 00:36:43,392
Ilbey is waiting for me.

256
00:36:45,992 --> 00:36:46,992
All right, Atsız.

257
00:36:54,472 --> 00:36:55,352
Sir.

258
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:58,312
What is it Bamsı?

259
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:01,672
There's a messenger from Bilecik.

260
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:06,072
Here comes our new enemy, sir.

261
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:10,192
All right.

262
00:37:11,672 --> 00:37:13,472
Let him in at once.

263
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,512
We shall see his stature
and sharpen our blades accordingly.

264
00:37:17,872 --> 00:37:19,032
As you wish, sir.

265
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:23,312
What kind of enemy
would you like to have, Turgut?

266
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:27,712
I just hope they don't take me captive.

267
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,192
That's all I want.

268
00:37:29,712 --> 00:37:31,712
I'm tired of being captured and rescued.

269
00:37:37,112 --> 00:37:39,272
What about you, Bamsı?

270
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:40,592
Honestly, sir,

271
00:37:40,752 --> 00:37:44,552
I don't want an enemy
that sows discord among us, anymore.

272
00:37:46,232 --> 00:37:47,992
-Right.
-Ertuğrul Bey.

273
00:37:49,472 --> 00:37:50,472
What about you?

274
00:37:51,392 --> 00:37:53,112
What kind of enemy do you want?

275
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:57,952
We've had many enemies,

276
00:37:58,752 --> 00:37:59,992
and many traitors.

277
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:05,712
This is my verdict on the nature
of our enemies after all this struggle.

278
00:38:07,512 --> 00:38:11,392
Some enemies back-stabbed us
disguised as friends.

279
00:38:12,272 --> 00:38:15,072
Emir Sadettin, for one.

280
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:21,952
Such people are usually very destructive.

281
00:38:23,072 --> 00:38:25,792
It has proved hard to defend
against their schemes.

282
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:28,752
Some enemies are the heathens.

283
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,832
You know what to expect from them.

284
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,712
Their schemes show up in time.

285
00:38:36,472 --> 00:38:38,512
The most dangerous kind of enemy is...

286
00:38:39,472 --> 00:38:43,112
the one that allies with the heathens
disguised as a friend.

287
00:38:45,152 --> 00:38:47,192
It's tricky to deal with them.

288
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:49,072
It's painful.

289
00:38:51,272 --> 00:38:54,792
Thank God we got rid of such enemies.

290
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,592
However, we lost many men.

291
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:03,952
Now, we'll learn from all this pain.

292
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:09,832
We'll face our weaknesses.

293
00:39:12,552 --> 00:39:15,432
-Am I clear?
-Yes, sir.

294
00:39:17,552 --> 00:39:20,352
Now, let him in, Bamsı.

295
00:39:21,312 --> 00:39:22,432
Right on, sir.

296
00:39:26,432 --> 00:39:28,232
That barbaric Turk called Ertuğrul

297
00:39:29,152 --> 00:39:32,872
fights with not his mind
but his faith, Titan.

298
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,072
We must fight with our faith, as well.

299
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:43,672
If we really want to take revenge,
we must finish Ertuğrul in one fell swoop.

300
00:39:44,352 --> 00:39:45,352
Yes.

301
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:49,352
With just one move, but how?

302
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:54,272
We must get him to think we retreated
and disappeared.

303
00:39:55,152 --> 00:39:58,632
And we'll prepare to hit him
when he's vulnerable.

304
00:40:01,352 --> 00:40:03,712
We can't sneak into the fortress.

305
00:40:04,632 --> 00:40:08,512
Ertuğrul must have taken all kinds
of measures against our attack.

306
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,952
There's only one place we can use
to sneak in and ambush Ertuğrul.

307
00:40:16,672 --> 00:40:17,672
The Hanlı Bazaar.

308
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:25,952
The Hanlı Bazaar.

309
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:40,112
I'm Commander Angelos.

310
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,592
I brought you greetings
from the Governor of Bilecik.

311
00:40:44,352 --> 00:40:48,752
As the token of his good will,
he sent you this white flag.

312
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:12,352
Why would he send you
when the war has just ended?

313
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:15,712
This is a great victory for you,
no doubt, Ertuğrul Bey.

314
00:41:16,512 --> 00:41:17,992
You are a great warrior.

315
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:24,272
But I came here to talk about peace,
and not war.

316
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:27,832
The governors here said the same thing.

317
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:32,152
-I hope yours doesn't end up like them.
-I'll get straight to the point.

318
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:36,312
I want you to hand over
Karacahisar Fortress to us.

319
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:39,832
In return, we're offering you
something more valuable.

320
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:47,032
I'll give you the taxes
from Karacahisar and Bilecik,

321
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,072
as well as Governor Ares' head.

322
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:57,352
This fortress you're in,

323
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:02,792
and all the lands
up to the Bilecik border,

324
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:07,552
have been taken with the blood
of our people.

325
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:12,112
If you want to take what's ours,

326
00:42:12,672 --> 00:42:14,712
you must risk taking up arms against us,

327
00:42:15,152 --> 00:42:17,512
and shed blood.

328
00:42:19,392 --> 00:42:20,392
Ertuğrul Bey.

329
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:23,312
I came here with good intentions.

330
00:42:23,912 --> 00:42:25,992
We can find a middle ground.

331
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,832
Consider it well.

332
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:34,952
You don't know me, so I'll forgive
such an insolent offer.

333
00:42:35,712 --> 00:42:38,992
Do you think I'd trust men
that would sell out

334
00:42:39,592 --> 00:42:42,192
the governor that sought refuge with them?

335
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:45,792
I'll take Ares' head sooner or later.

336
00:42:47,152 --> 00:42:53,672
You just need to stop supporting Ares,
if you want your head intact.

337
00:42:57,872 --> 00:42:58,952
Now, go back.

338
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:04,592
Tell your governor to think long and hard.

339
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:10,912
Make him realize he is playing with fire
by protecting Ares.

340
00:43:12,552 --> 00:43:14,472
I'll pretend you didn't make this offer.

341
00:43:15,112 --> 00:43:17,672
Your attitude will cause yet another war.

342
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:24,952
The honest war I fight is more honorable
than your treacherous peace.

343
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:30,712
I came to these lands
to collapse the nest of evil around you.

344
00:43:32,752 --> 00:43:33,672
You may go now.

345
00:43:38,672 --> 00:43:39,512
Ertuğrul Bey.

346
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:44,512
I said the man that'll take us
to Ares would come to our doorstep.

347
00:43:45,512 --> 00:43:48,392
I'll track Ares down, if I may.

348
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:50,832
That shall be my last mission.

349
00:43:51,232 --> 00:43:52,232
Thank you.

350
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:56,432
Take some men with you, Atsız.
Follow that commander.

351
00:43:57,352 --> 00:43:59,552
See where they are hiding Ares.

352
00:43:59,792 --> 00:44:00,992
Let me know.

353
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:02,912
Yes, Ertuğrul Bey.

354
00:44:10,432 --> 00:44:14,312
Sir. Atsız went after him.
What should we do?

355
00:44:16,072 --> 00:44:20,552
They'll do their best to wear us out
until an army from Nicaea arrives, Bamsı.

356
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:26,072
We must all take measure
to destroy their schemes.

357
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:32,472
Tomorrow, I'll explain what measures
to the Oghuz beys at the meeting.

358
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:36,472
We'll deal with our own problems.

359
00:44:38,672 --> 00:44:40,592
Did you tell the merchants
at the Hanlı Bazaar

360
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:42,072
that we'd come after the meeting?

361
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:43,712
We did, sir.

362
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,072
Good.

363
00:44:45,672 --> 00:44:48,752
They should know what
they must do in this new order.

364
00:44:51,992 --> 00:44:53,872
How are things in your tribe, Turgut?

365
00:44:54,232 --> 00:44:57,672
Bahadir's tribe has come
and they want to see me, sir.

366
00:44:57,832 --> 00:44:58,912
Well then.

367
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:00,432
Go back to your tribe.

368
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:04,112
Invite them to your marquee
and tell them the state of things.

369
00:45:04,832 --> 00:45:07,512
If they comply with you,
they may live in your tribe.

370
00:45:08,352 --> 00:45:13,592
If they don't comply,
and want to be left alone,

371
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:16,952
then they should know
what will happen to them.

372
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,872
As you wish, sir.

373
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:21,672
Thank you.

374
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:55,432
He won't leave me be.

375
00:45:56,872 --> 00:45:58,032
What is it now, Göktuğ?

376
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:02,632
Why did he send for me?

377
00:46:02,872 --> 00:46:04,632
I spoke to the men close to him.

378
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,232
There's no sign of anything, sir.

379
00:46:09,472 --> 00:46:10,472
It's just...

380
00:46:11,392 --> 00:46:12,392
Just what?

381
00:46:15,432 --> 00:46:19,352
They say a messenger
from Karacahisar has arrived.

382
00:46:20,232 --> 00:46:21,672
Is it from Ertuğrul?

383
00:46:27,912 --> 00:46:29,112
Emir, sir.

384
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,472
His Highness is waiting for you.

385
00:46:56,672 --> 00:46:58,312
The well-being of Turkmen tribes...

386
00:46:59,872 --> 00:47:01,912
means the well-being of our country.

387
00:47:03,632 --> 00:47:06,752
Is that why you ordered
an attack on the east, Your Highness?

388
00:47:08,232 --> 00:47:09,232
Yes.

389
00:47:09,912 --> 00:47:14,512
I want them to see that
we are strong and agile enough to fight

390
00:47:15,152 --> 00:47:18,192
against the Mongols
with the Turkmen tribes at all times.

391
00:47:23,352 --> 00:47:25,232
Make preparations at once.

392
00:47:25,392 --> 00:47:26,672
As you wish, Your Highness.

393
00:47:49,352 --> 00:47:51,232
You sent for me, Your Highness?

394
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:54,072
Sadettin, Ertuğrul Bey sent a messenger.

395
00:47:55,912 --> 00:47:56,912
Is that so?

396
00:47:57,392 --> 00:47:59,512
And what does he say?

397
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:06,592
Ertuğrul Bey conquered
the Karacahisar Fortress.

398
00:48:15,432 --> 00:48:16,512
Are you so surprised?

399
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:21,072
It's happiness, Your Highness.

400
00:48:22,592 --> 00:48:24,432
I'm tongue-tied with happiness.

401
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:32,072
I hope that Ertuğrul Bey managed

402
00:48:32,152 --> 00:48:36,072
to hang the head of that dog Ares
on the gates.

403
00:48:41,592 --> 00:48:44,192
That dog Ares managed to escape.

404
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:27,032
Artuk Bey.

405
00:49:27,952 --> 00:49:29,632
I found an important letter.

406
00:49:30,872 --> 00:49:31,872
What does it say?

407
00:49:32,912 --> 00:49:38,072
It says that they gave Bahadir Bey
money to buy the Hanlı Bazaar

408
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,792
upon a request from an emir
of the Seljuks.

409
00:49:44,592 --> 00:49:45,752
Are you sure, Marya?

410
00:49:45,992 --> 00:49:46,992
I'm sure.

411
00:49:49,192 --> 00:49:53,472
You keep looking.
I need to see Ertuğrul Bey.

412
00:50:01,672 --> 00:50:08,032
Sadettin, I want you to write a letter
to Ertuğrul Bey, saying that

413
00:50:09,032 --> 00:50:11,592
I shall award him
the Karacahisar Fortress,

414
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:13,712
plus Söğüt and Domaniç.

415
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,352
Your Highness.

416
00:50:26,632 --> 00:50:31,032
Ertuğrul Bey deserves the best
of everything

417
00:50:31,752 --> 00:50:33,912
for his loyalty and bravery.

418
00:50:34,672 --> 00:50:35,672
That's for sure.

419
00:50:36,632 --> 00:50:40,312
However, I'd like to remind you

420
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:44,392
that you haven't given such a privilege
to any other beys.

421
00:50:46,152 --> 00:50:51,872
I'm afraid it may cause a falling out
between the beys.

422
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:53,432
No.

423
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:57,152
On the contrary.

424
00:51:01,432 --> 00:51:05,832
They will all learn to be unflinching
just like Ertuğrul Bey.

425
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:09,872
Not just the beys that are subject to me,

426
00:51:10,832 --> 00:51:12,712
but also the servants at my palace.

427
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:20,032
When our country is fighting
on both sides, trying to survive,

428
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:25,552
what we need the most
is courage and loyalty.

429
00:51:27,272 --> 00:51:28,752
Just like Ertuğrul Bey.

430
00:51:31,712 --> 00:51:33,312
Ertuğrul Bey says

431
00:51:33,992 --> 00:51:38,232
he wants to see me
and come to Konya personally to give me

432
00:51:39,152 --> 00:51:40,992
one fifth of the spoils from the conquest.

433
00:51:44,832 --> 00:51:45,992
Your Highness.

434
00:51:46,872 --> 00:51:52,632
I thought you were going to make
for Erzurum and Ahlat with our armies

435
00:51:53,552 --> 00:51:57,832
to check our borders, and then spend
the summer at Alaiye

436
00:51:58,232 --> 00:52:00,112
with your wife Hunat Hatun.

437
00:52:00,512 --> 00:52:03,312
I'll postpone the attack for a while
to see Ertuğrul.

438
00:52:10,112 --> 00:52:14,512
Do you have any evidence
on the traps that were set

439
00:52:15,312 --> 00:52:17,032
for me and Ertuğrul Bey, Sadettin?

440
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:20,912
Soon, Your Highness.

441
00:52:22,992 --> 00:52:24,752
There is not much time left.

442
00:52:26,832 --> 00:52:30,072
You'll find out about everything soon.

443
00:52:38,192 --> 00:52:39,792
Same for you, Sadettin.

444
00:52:41,872 --> 00:52:43,792
There's not much time left for you.

445
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:26,472
I was just talking about you, Artuk Bey.

446
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,032
Right, sir.

447
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,672
We found something important.

448
00:53:31,832 --> 00:53:33,272
What is it?

449
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:38,352
Sir, it'd be in our best interest to talk
about this alone when you're available.

450
00:53:40,992 --> 00:53:41,992
All right.

451
00:53:43,592 --> 00:53:46,952
Let the Greek people know what I said.

452
00:53:47,672 --> 00:53:49,192
You may leave.

453
00:53:49,312 --> 00:53:51,192
God bless you.

454
00:54:10,232 --> 00:54:12,672
Sir, Marya found an important letter.

455
00:54:13,872 --> 00:54:17,392
She said it says Bahadir Bey received
some money to buy the Hanlı Bazaar

456
00:54:17,952 --> 00:54:20,592
on the orders of an emir of the Seljuks.

457
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:30,352
On the orders
of an emir of the Seljuks, huh?

458
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:35,512
Emir Sadettin.

459
00:54:39,312 --> 00:54:40,792
Your schemes are over.

460
00:54:43,272 --> 00:54:47,232
The jackals that have spread
in our country showed themselves.

461
00:54:47,872 --> 00:54:49,192
What will you do now, sir?

462
00:54:54,712 --> 00:54:58,152
I'll take this letter with me
when I go to see the Sultan.

463
00:54:58,952 --> 00:55:04,552
This letter will be a death sentence
for Emir Sadettin.

464
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:17,209
Watch out.

465
00:57:56,369 --> 00:57:57,809
Must be Commander Angelos.

466
00:58:24,009 --> 00:58:25,489
Why are these infidels here?

467
00:58:30,409 --> 00:58:31,969
Must be a secret location.

468
00:58:33,649 --> 00:58:36,929
We'll spend the night to find out
what happens inside.

469
00:58:47,209 --> 00:58:48,329
Commander Angelos.

470
00:58:50,449 --> 00:58:53,129
I'm sure Ertuğrul welcomed you with joy.

471
00:58:54,289 --> 00:58:56,609
He crushed me with his words.

472
00:58:57,929 --> 00:58:59,729
He wanted war, I wanted peace.

473
00:59:01,889 --> 00:59:03,449
He wanted blood and profit.

474
00:59:05,929 --> 00:59:06,929
What did you expect?

475
00:59:07,649 --> 00:59:10,049
For him to just hand over the castle?

476
00:59:11,169 --> 00:59:12,569
Like you, Ares?

477
00:59:15,409 --> 00:59:16,409
What are you doing?

478
00:59:17,209 --> 00:59:21,129
Do you want to grant a victory to
the enemy with your own hands? Ares!

479
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:25,089
Be grateful that the Emperor hasn't
given up on you, Ares.

480
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:29,249
Otherwise, I'd make you pay for
what you've done.

481
00:59:29,689 --> 00:59:32,529
I'll make you eat your words, Angelos.

482
00:59:33,209 --> 00:59:34,209
Don't forget.

483
00:59:35,089 --> 00:59:38,529
The Emperor will not tolerate
another failure.

484
00:59:39,169 --> 00:59:40,329
Don't forget it.

485
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:41,649
Don't worry.

486
00:59:43,169 --> 00:59:46,049
I'll bring his head to the Emperor myself.

487
00:59:49,329 --> 00:59:52,609
How will you do this
when Ertuğrul has taken precautions?

488
00:59:53,209 --> 00:59:54,529
You can't even come close.

489
00:59:55,289 --> 00:59:58,289
He'll be defenseless at the Hanlı Bazaar.

490
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:03,449
I'll infiltrate the Hanlı Bazaar
and kill him.

491
01:00:05,809 --> 01:00:08,449
Since you wish to kill him
at the Hanlı Bazaar,

492
01:00:09,009 --> 01:00:11,609
I have some information for you.

493
01:00:14,169 --> 01:00:16,049
One of my spies there has said

494
01:00:16,769 --> 01:00:19,569
that Ertuğrul was going
to hold a meeting at the castle.

495
01:00:20,569 --> 01:00:24,009
He and his beys would go
to the Hanlı Bazaar afterwards.

496
01:00:24,609 --> 01:00:27,089
Ertuğrul will be defenseless near
the merchants.

497
01:00:27,729 --> 01:00:29,809
I need men for this, Angelos.

498
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:36,209
This great victory is not only for me,
but for the Emperor.

499
01:00:39,209 --> 01:00:40,209
All right.

500
01:00:41,009 --> 01:00:43,089
I'll give you men for our Emperor.

501
01:00:43,649 --> 01:00:45,249
But if you fail...

502
01:00:46,689 --> 01:00:48,889
there'll be hell to pay, Ares.

503
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:53,609
We don't have many men there.

504
01:00:54,329 --> 01:00:57,409
Even if we kill Ertuğrul,
it would be hard to leave.

505
01:00:58,169 --> 01:00:59,169
You're right.

506
01:01:01,889 --> 01:01:04,369
While I infiltrate the Hanlı Bazaar
with the men,

507
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:08,409
you and Commander Angelos must go
to Bilecik and get reinforcements.

508
01:01:09,409 --> 01:01:13,289
Don't forget, Titan, you're the key
to get us out of the Hanlı Bazaar.

509
01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:32,169
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you.

510
01:01:32,649 --> 01:01:33,729
Thank you, all.

511
01:01:34,129 --> 01:01:35,129
Thanks.

512
01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:38,169
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you.

513
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:40,089
Good day.

514
01:01:41,129 --> 01:01:43,449
-Eat well.
-Thank you.

515
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:45,369
Thank you, sit.

516
01:01:45,729 --> 01:01:47,769
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

517
01:01:49,249 --> 01:01:53,489
-Welcome.
-Thanks, my Bey.

518
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:56,529
-Thanks.
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.

519
01:01:56,689 --> 01:01:58,209
Thank you.

520
01:01:58,729 --> 01:02:01,209
-Welcome, my bey.
-Thank you.

521
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,169
Thank you.

522
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:04,849
Welcome, my bey.

523
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,529
We heard what you said about us.

524
01:02:07,649 --> 01:02:09,729
You saved us from Ares.

525
01:02:10,729 --> 01:02:11,729
Scum.

526
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:13,609
They're licking his boots.

527
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:16,769
Now we have food.
God bless you, Ertuğrul Bey.

528
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:18,889
That's our last chance.

529
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:22,369
We either kill him now or never.

530
01:02:23,649 --> 01:02:28,329
We either die with honor or we live
as slaves under the Turk's sword.

531
01:02:31,169 --> 01:02:35,049
You are our neighbors,
our people.

532
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:40,489
Sometimes we share our sadness,
and sometimes our happiness with you.

533
01:02:41,209 --> 01:02:45,449
As we try to be just for the sake
of our faith,

534
01:02:46,249 --> 01:02:51,049
you must try to be the same
with your money and balances.

535
01:02:51,529 --> 01:02:54,689
Do the same,
so that we can respect you.

536
01:02:57,529 --> 01:02:59,529
Trader, how much for this?

537
01:03:00,249 --> 01:03:03,009
The bag for my mother,
and this for my grandmother.

538
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:05,969
You're Ertuğrul Bey's son,
we won't take your gold.

539
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,809
No, you'll get your money.

540
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:11,729
Then I'll lower the price for two bags.

541
01:03:12,129 --> 01:03:13,569
All right then, Gündüz Bey.

542
01:03:14,089 --> 01:03:15,529
Bargaining is a good thing.

543
01:03:18,649 --> 01:03:21,889
-God bless you.
-Thanks.

544
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:27,209
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you.

545
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:28,649
Thank you.

546
01:03:29,329 --> 01:03:31,809
-What is it, Gündüz?
-If you allow, Father,

547
01:03:32,049 --> 01:03:35,569
I'll buy this bag for Mother
and this one for Grandmother.

548
01:03:36,169 --> 01:03:38,809
I'm glad you thought about them.

549
01:03:39,489 --> 01:03:40,489
All right then.

550
01:03:41,049 --> 01:03:43,609
-How much for them?
-My bey, please.

551
01:03:44,049 --> 01:03:47,369
You helped everyone.
I can't take your money.

552
01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:50,929
I must pay you your time's worth.

553
01:03:51,089 --> 01:03:52,929
-How much?
-Your son said the same.

554
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:54,289
You raised him well.

555
01:03:54,729 --> 01:03:57,249
Three gold coins for them, Ertuğrul Bey.

556
01:03:58,289 --> 01:03:59,289
All right.

557
01:04:56,609 --> 01:04:57,809
Forgive me, my bey.

558
01:04:58,489 --> 01:05:01,329
Forgiving the evil is condemning the good.

559
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:19,049
Good boy, come here.

560
01:05:19,969 --> 01:05:21,169
Well done.

561
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:24,649
Abdur Rahman.

562
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:26,689
Gather the bodies.

563
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:28,729
As you order.

564
01:05:36,289 --> 01:05:39,369
Bahadır Bey has overstepped his bounds.

565
01:05:41,329 --> 01:05:45,049
Ertuğrul Bey and I attempted to reconcile
with him. He refused.

566
01:05:47,289 --> 01:05:49,089
He got what he deserved.

567
01:05:51,569 --> 01:05:55,009
Turgut Bey has become
the Çavdar Tribe's bey,

568
01:05:55,329 --> 01:05:57,329
by the frontier bey Ertuğrul's order.

569
01:05:57,769 --> 01:05:58,769
Congratulations.

570
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:00,209
Thank you.

571
01:06:00,529 --> 01:06:02,449
We heard about Bahadır Bey's doings.

572
01:06:02,649 --> 01:06:05,089
They have disappointed us.

573
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,769
We didn't think this would happen.

574
01:06:09,849 --> 01:06:13,489
We set off to unite our tribes.

575
01:06:15,329 --> 01:06:17,169
We won't make anyone suffer.

576
01:06:18,169 --> 01:06:23,769
If you wish to unite,
we can live together in peace.

577
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:26,209
We'd be glad.

578
01:06:27,209 --> 01:06:29,729
If you wish to live together
in the village,

579
01:06:31,209 --> 01:06:33,449
you must obey Turgut Bey first.

580
01:06:44,249 --> 01:06:45,809
I wish you a good reign.

581
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,169
Thank you.

582
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:55,409
I wish you a good reign.

583
01:06:56,329 --> 01:06:57,329
Thank you.

584
01:07:05,729 --> 01:07:07,209
I wish you a good reign.

585
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:09,289
Thank you.

586
01:07:14,009 --> 01:07:17,009
Tomorrow, Ertuğrul Bey holds a council
at the castle.

587
01:07:18,609 --> 01:07:21,609
-You should attend too.
-As you order.

588
01:07:30,249 --> 01:07:31,249
Oğuz.

589
01:07:32,409 --> 01:07:33,409
Leave.

590
01:07:34,129 --> 01:07:35,129
As you order.

591
01:07:41,209 --> 01:07:42,929
Who is the bey, Aslıhan Hatun?

592
01:07:50,329 --> 01:07:51,409
You are, Turgut.

593
01:07:53,849 --> 01:07:56,929
Then, don't speak after me.

594
01:07:59,169 --> 01:08:00,169
Turgut.

595
01:08:06,409 --> 01:08:09,969
From now on,
don't get involved in tribal matters.

596
01:08:11,209 --> 01:08:12,609
You won't attend councils.

597
01:08:13,369 --> 01:08:16,009
You're responsible
for the women and the tailors.

598
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:19,969
In this village, I have the last word.

599
01:08:21,729 --> 01:08:25,569
I have the only sword, I rule alone.

600
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:36,049
Did you understand?

601
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:39,569
You're my husband.

602
01:08:52,889 --> 01:08:53,889
You're my husband.

603
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:00,649
You're my husband.

604
01:09:05,409 --> 01:09:06,529
You're my husband.

605
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:27,409
You're my love.

606
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:34,449
My honor.

607
01:09:41,049 --> 01:09:42,049
My pride.

608
01:09:49,329 --> 01:09:51,209
How are the preparations going?

609
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,449
Everything is set, my bey.

610
01:09:54,369 --> 01:09:57,369
Tomorrow, we'll have a council
worthy of our victory.

611
01:09:57,609 --> 01:09:58,729
Don't worry.

612
01:09:59,489 --> 01:10:02,649
Both mother and I are taking care
of everything.

613
01:10:03,529 --> 01:10:04,529
Thank you.

614
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:10,209
Hand out food for the elderly and homeless
at the market.

615
01:10:10,649 --> 01:10:14,249
As you order.
I'll take care of it personally.

616
01:10:16,569 --> 01:10:17,969
How is Marya?

617
01:10:18,249 --> 01:10:19,249
She's fine.

618
01:10:19,609 --> 01:10:22,489
She works to do her duty.

619
01:10:22,889 --> 01:10:25,529
She and Artuk Bey search the documents.

620
01:10:26,209 --> 01:10:27,209
Good.

621
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:53,089
-What is this?
-A letter from the Emperor for you.

622
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:07,129
Our Emperor gave Ares a last chance.

623
01:11:09,729 --> 01:11:13,169
If he fails again, you'll kill him...

624
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:16,649
and become commander.

625
01:11:18,689 --> 01:11:21,329
You'll fight Ertuğrul under my orders.

626
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:26,289
I'll take care of all your needs
including reinforcements.

627
01:11:36,449 --> 01:11:37,889
I'll never betray Ares.

628
01:11:45,169 --> 01:11:46,169
Titan.

629
01:11:47,769 --> 01:11:50,449
Nobody knows your bravery and loyalty
like I do.

630
01:11:51,449 --> 01:11:53,009
Didn't you see Ares?

631
01:11:54,529 --> 01:11:57,289
Ertuğrul has poisoned his soul.

632
01:11:58,729 --> 01:12:02,289
We lost hundreds of men
for his rage and pride.

633
01:12:03,289 --> 01:12:07,689
The Turks have taken
our most important castle.

634
01:12:08,969 --> 01:12:12,009
And more importantly,
we lost our prestige.

635
01:12:14,969 --> 01:12:16,089
Nicaea is worried.

636
01:12:16,809 --> 01:12:17,889
So are the people.

637
01:12:18,529 --> 01:12:20,409
A civil war might even erupt.

638
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:25,689
If Nicaea falls,
think about what will happen.

639
01:12:42,249 --> 01:12:43,249
Father.

640
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,569
We only had one village.

641
01:12:46,049 --> 01:12:47,969
Now, we have a castle.

642
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:50,249
How did we become so strong?

643
01:12:54,129 --> 01:12:57,049
Look Gündüz, do you see?

644
01:12:57,849 --> 01:13:02,969
Small sparks have united
to become a big fire.

645
01:13:04,729 --> 01:13:06,649
Union makes strength.

646
01:13:08,169 --> 01:13:12,929
We became a big fire by uniting ourselves
just like these sparks.

647
01:13:14,369 --> 01:13:16,609
We gave warmth to our friends,

648
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:20,089
we burned away our enemies.

649
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:24,649
Look, son.

650
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:28,889
We endured many difficulties on this path.

651
01:13:29,849 --> 01:13:32,289
Our tribe was hungry.

652
01:13:32,969 --> 01:13:34,529
Our animals died.

653
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:38,409
We lost many brave men.

654
01:13:40,209 --> 01:13:42,769
We settled on barren lands.

655
01:13:43,649 --> 01:13:48,129
What brought us here from those places
was our loyalty

656
01:13:48,289 --> 01:13:53,649
to God's cause and tradition
and to each other.

657
01:13:54,649 --> 01:14:00,289
Father, if I have difficulties
when I grow up, what should I do?

658
01:14:06,449 --> 01:14:09,689
Always mention God's name, son.

659
01:14:10,849 --> 01:14:13,129
If you fall into a dark hole someday,

660
01:14:13,769 --> 01:14:17,489
hold God's hand so you can live.

661
01:14:18,489 --> 01:14:23,689
If you take up God's cause,
he won't leave you alone.

662
01:14:25,129 --> 01:14:28,649
Your people and your friends
will support you.

663
01:14:30,769 --> 01:14:37,489
If you don't leave the right path,
the followers of God will be your friends.

664
01:14:38,249 --> 01:14:40,849
Father, how will I find them?

665
01:14:42,689 --> 01:14:46,649
If you follow the path,
they will find you, son.

666
01:14:58,769 --> 01:15:00,529
You have an important guest.

667
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:02,129
Who, Abdur Rahman?

668
01:15:05,449 --> 01:15:07,889
Just a poor fellow on the road.

669
01:15:08,889 --> 01:15:10,049
Good to see you.

670
01:15:12,289 --> 01:15:13,329
<i>Selamunaleykum.</i>

671
01:15:13,689 --> 01:15:14,769
<i>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

672
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:22,009
-Welcome.
-Thank you, son.

673
01:15:26,969 --> 01:15:28,329
<i>Mashallah.</i>

674
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:29,969
Thank you, brave warrior.

675
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:33,449
Come along.

676
01:15:43,369 --> 01:15:44,969
Come, son.

677
01:16:10,449 --> 01:16:15,569
Peace and mercy of God be upon you.

678
01:16:16,889 --> 01:16:17,889
Amen.

679
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:27,649
Oh, God.

680
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:34,169
You granted me many things
in this mortal world.

681
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:41,489
You let me raise my kids
and see my grandchildren.

682
01:16:43,569 --> 01:16:49,889
You granted me and Suleyman Shah
many conquests.

683
01:16:51,729 --> 01:16:56,049
You helped us endure
many troubles and evil men,

684
01:16:57,009 --> 01:17:01,009
and conquer castles
with my son Ertuğrul.

685
01:17:04,729 --> 01:17:07,329
All the glory to you, oh God.

686
01:17:10,369 --> 01:17:15,489
When it's time to die,
give me faith and strength, oh God.

687
01:17:17,129 --> 01:17:21,769
Reunite me with Suleyman Shah
in Heaven.

688
01:17:22,729 --> 01:17:25,849
Protect my tribe and my children.

689
01:17:27,129 --> 01:17:29,009
Keep me near our Prophet.

690
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:37,369
I only ask your help,
I only seek your refuge.

691
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:40,489
Amen.

692
01:17:49,209 --> 01:17:50,209
Oh, God.

693
01:17:52,609 --> 01:17:54,209
Help us.

694
01:18:29,649 --> 01:18:32,089
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

695
01:18:33,169 --> 01:18:36,809
We really missed your wise words.

696
01:18:37,249 --> 01:18:38,849
I was in the Holy Land.

697
01:18:39,929 --> 01:18:42,169
The land of our Prophet.

698
01:18:42,889 --> 01:18:46,009
As soon as I arrived,
I heard the news and came to visit.

699
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:48,049
You honored us.

700
01:18:49,329 --> 01:18:50,409
<i>Hallelujah.</i>

701
01:18:50,889 --> 01:18:53,849
You conquered this castle,
now it belongs to Islam.

702
01:18:54,849 --> 01:18:57,169
You opened the way for many good things.

703
01:18:57,769 --> 01:18:59,049
A good conquest.

704
01:19:00,209 --> 01:19:02,769
May it allow you to conquer hearts
as well.

705
01:19:02,929 --> 01:19:04,569
Amen. Amen.

706
01:19:06,369 --> 01:19:10,929
Ertuğrul Bey,
your conquest reminds me of Umar

707
01:19:11,609 --> 01:19:15,089
who took Jerusalem from non-Muslims
and made it an Islamic city.

708
01:19:16,489 --> 01:19:19,969
Jerusalem was conquered
by the armies of Islam.

709
01:19:21,209 --> 01:19:22,649
The former administrators said

710
01:19:23,129 --> 01:19:26,369
they would only give the keys
of the city to the Caliph.

711
01:19:27,049 --> 01:19:31,769
Therefore, Umar and his slave
set off with a camel.

712
01:19:32,169 --> 01:19:36,649
Umar and his slave took turns
riding the camel.

713
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:39,089
At last they arrive...

714
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:42,809
and they see Jerusalem from a hill.

715
01:19:43,289 --> 01:19:46,169
Then, it was the slave's turn
to ride the camel.

716
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:49,529
The slave forfeits his turn and says,

717
01:19:50,009 --> 01:19:51,489
"Oh, Leader of the Faithful,

718
01:19:52,009 --> 01:19:56,169
it would be more appropriate for you
to ride the camel."

719
01:19:57,609 --> 01:19:59,369
Umar refuses.

720
01:20:01,609 --> 01:20:05,009
"He whose turn has come,
shall go riding" he says.

721
01:20:06,329 --> 01:20:09,089
So, he holds the camel
while the slave rides

722
01:20:10,409 --> 01:20:12,849
and they enter the city.

723
01:20:14,289 --> 01:20:17,489
Those who waited thought
the slave was the Caliph

724
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:18,969
and showed him respect.

725
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:20,929
He was ashamed.

726
01:20:21,969 --> 01:20:26,489
He says he's not the Caliph,
that the Caliph is the one walking.

727
01:20:27,729 --> 01:20:29,329
Everyone is shocked.

728
01:20:30,729 --> 01:20:33,329
"How can that Caliph,
who makes the world tremble,

729
01:20:33,769 --> 01:20:37,289
enter the city holding the camel
which carries a slave?"

730
01:20:38,249 --> 01:20:39,809
They ask this to Umar.

731
01:20:40,609 --> 01:20:41,609
He replies,

732
01:20:42,369 --> 01:20:45,769
"Before God,
there's no difference between us.

733
01:20:46,769 --> 01:20:50,089
The superiority is about loyalty to God.

734
01:20:52,209 --> 01:20:54,449
We took turns on the camel.

735
01:20:55,049 --> 01:20:58,089
It was his turn, so, he was riding it."

736
01:20:58,969 --> 01:21:01,529
The people were shocked.

737
01:21:02,249 --> 01:21:08,529
Umar's act helped him conquer
the hearts of many non-Muslims.

738
01:21:10,729 --> 01:21:11,729
Ertuğrul Bey,

739
01:21:12,049 --> 01:21:16,089
you did a great duty conquering this place
in the name of Islam.

740
01:21:16,889 --> 01:21:19,689
But your real duty has not yet begun.

741
01:21:20,169 --> 01:21:25,209
For greater conquests,
you must raise men of merit.

742
01:21:29,729 --> 01:21:32,209
For it is men who keep a country running.

743
01:21:33,129 --> 01:21:36,249
If you don't have any men of merit...

744
01:21:37,529 --> 01:21:39,249
your conquests won't last.

745
01:21:40,489 --> 01:21:43,169
That's why you must rule with justice.

746
01:21:44,409 --> 01:21:46,529
Conquer hearts with justice.

747
01:21:46,809 --> 01:21:48,929
Make the world tremble with your glory.

748
01:21:51,529 --> 01:21:54,609
Your duty is harder,
your load is heavier.

749
01:21:55,449 --> 01:21:59,449
But don't forget,
as long as you follow the path...

750
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:03,409
God's mercy will always be upon you.

751
01:22:06,369 --> 01:22:07,369
Thank you.

752
01:22:21,529 --> 01:22:22,929
Marya Hatun, mashallah.

753
01:22:23,489 --> 01:22:25,289
You're talented.

754
01:22:26,529 --> 01:22:28,049
And you have a good heart.

755
01:22:29,729 --> 01:22:31,009
We love you a lot.

756
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:33,569
Therefore,

757
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:38,689
Ertuğrul Bey wants you to have a family
and raise children like yourself,

758
01:22:39,129 --> 01:22:41,329
instead of being alone.

759
01:22:46,569 --> 01:22:49,209
Does Ertuğrul Bey want me married?

760
01:22:49,969 --> 01:22:50,969
Yes.

761
01:22:51,969 --> 01:22:55,529
Ertuğrul Bey found you a suitor as well.

762
01:22:58,889 --> 01:23:00,489
I don't know what to say.

763
01:23:03,329 --> 01:23:04,329
But how?

764
01:23:04,529 --> 01:23:08,129
If Ertuğrul Bey found someone for you,
he won't force you.

765
01:23:08,969 --> 01:23:10,649
We don't do that here.

766
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:14,369
What's important is your desire.

767
01:23:19,249 --> 01:23:21,729
Can I adapt to your customs?

768
01:23:22,409 --> 01:23:23,529
I'm a Christian, too.

769
01:23:24,769 --> 01:23:27,569
Would one of you marry me?

770
01:23:28,289 --> 01:23:29,289
Marya Hatun...

771
01:23:29,889 --> 01:23:33,769
You being Christian poses
no religious problems to us.

772
01:23:35,209 --> 01:23:39,089
In our religion,
a Christian woman can marry a Muslim man.

773
01:23:40,009 --> 01:23:42,209
Don't feel under pressure, okay?

774
01:23:43,089 --> 01:23:45,249
What's important is your desire.

775
01:23:47,929 --> 01:23:48,929
Marya.

776
01:23:49,489 --> 01:23:54,409
I was a Christian
just before I married Bamsı.

777
01:23:58,169 --> 01:24:03,889
But the hospitality of these people
has really affected me.

778
01:24:05,169 --> 01:24:08,369
And I converted to Islam of my own will.

779
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:15,369
Also, the suitor Ertuğrul Bey has found
for you

780
01:24:15,849 --> 01:24:19,809
is also a good and a talented person.
It's Artuk Bey.

781
01:24:23,769 --> 01:24:26,609
-Artuk Bey?
-Yeah, Artuk Bey.

782
01:24:38,769 --> 01:24:43,209
Artuk Bey,
he's a good and talented man...

783
01:24:45,769 --> 01:24:46,769
like you said.

784
01:24:47,889 --> 01:24:48,889
He is.

785
01:24:56,409 --> 01:24:59,369
If Artuk Bey wants it,
then I want it too.

786
01:25:03,249 --> 01:25:07,489
Marya, you'll have the time of your life.

787
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:10,369
You won't regret it.

788
01:25:13,529 --> 01:25:14,529
Thank you.

789
01:25:15,409 --> 01:25:16,569
Thank you as well.

790
01:25:17,569 --> 01:25:19,369
-Thanks.
-You too.

791
01:25:23,249 --> 01:25:24,969
Despite his failures,

792
01:25:25,849 --> 01:25:28,809
I asked the Emperor to give
Ares another chance.

793
01:25:29,689 --> 01:25:32,569
Without me, he would be dead.

794
01:25:33,609 --> 01:25:37,489
If Ares succeeds,
we'll stand by him until the end.

795
01:25:38,249 --> 01:25:39,249
Both of us.

796
01:25:40,689 --> 01:25:42,049
But if he fails again...

797
01:25:44,409 --> 01:25:46,209
Then the duty awaits you, Titan.

798
01:25:48,529 --> 01:25:53,009
If you won't,
I have the authority to send you away.

799
01:25:55,569 --> 01:25:57,369
The Emperor prepares his army.

800
01:25:58,849 --> 01:26:00,809
We'll both lead the army.

801
01:26:21,449 --> 01:26:23,209
I spoke with the soldiers outside.

802
01:26:24,969 --> 01:26:28,849
They can't wait to attack the Hanlı Bazaar
and avenge their fallen friends.

803
01:26:29,729 --> 01:26:31,249
They're all ready to die.

804
01:26:31,809 --> 01:26:33,529
Good luck, Commander Ares.

805
01:26:35,289 --> 01:26:36,849
May God forgive our sins.

806
01:27:00,609 --> 01:27:01,689
Are you okay, Halime?

807
01:27:02,649 --> 01:27:03,689
You look sad.

808
01:27:05,409 --> 01:27:07,329
No, I'm fine.

809
01:27:27,569 --> 01:27:29,249
Tell me Halime, what happened?

810
01:27:30,089 --> 01:27:31,209
I know you well.

811
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:38,209
I was going to see you today, Ertuğrul.

812
01:27:39,089 --> 01:27:41,089
Abdur Rahman Alp didn't let me in.

813
01:27:42,409 --> 01:27:43,609
It annoyed me.

814
01:27:45,729 --> 01:27:51,249
I wonder if these stones will make us
grow distant.

815
01:27:54,489 --> 01:27:55,489
My Halime...

816
01:27:59,089 --> 01:28:00,089
My Halime.

817
01:28:00,729 --> 01:28:01,729
What do you mean?

818
01:28:02,929 --> 01:28:09,849
Our love will overcome even steel fences,
let alone walls of stone.

819
01:28:11,049 --> 01:28:13,649
Your place is where I am.

820
01:28:16,289 --> 01:28:18,649
Then why wasn't I allowed in, Ertuğrul?

821
01:28:23,729 --> 01:28:28,009
I looked behind and saw
how our lives changed.

822
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:35,569
A person might forget that it was God
who brought him where he is.

823
01:28:37,329 --> 01:28:41,369
I'm afraid of making the same mistake
if I don't paying attention.

824
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:48,769
That's why I wanted to be alone
and think.

825
01:28:54,769 --> 01:28:55,769
My Halime.

826
01:28:56,729 --> 01:29:00,809
You're my love,
the throne of my heart.

827
01:29:02,329 --> 01:29:05,769
Your place is always my side.

828
01:29:14,609 --> 01:29:19,089
May God never let me
out of your heart and mind, Ertuğrul.

829
01:29:43,489 --> 01:29:46,129
We spoke with Marya Hatun today.

830
01:29:46,769 --> 01:29:49,009
She wants to marry Artuk Bey.

831
01:29:50,729 --> 01:29:51,729
All right.

832
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:54,369
And I told Bamsı Alp.

833
01:29:55,609 --> 01:29:58,209
Asked him to talk to Artuk Bey.

834
01:29:59,609 --> 01:30:02,049
I hope they'll be happily married.

835
01:30:02,329 --> 01:30:03,329
So do I.

836
01:30:10,129 --> 01:30:12,609
I have another thing to say, my bey.

837
01:30:13,169 --> 01:30:14,169
Tell me.

838
01:30:15,049 --> 01:30:16,169
It's about Mother.

839
01:30:17,369 --> 01:30:19,369
What happened to Mother, Halime?

840
01:30:21,729 --> 01:30:23,809
Her heart had a problem this morning.

841
01:30:24,529 --> 01:30:25,889
She was in pain.

842
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:29,369
She told me she was all right,
but I'm worried.

843
01:30:31,049 --> 01:30:32,929
Go see your mother tomorrow.

844
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:36,049
Don't tell her I told you,
she'll be angry.

845
01:30:37,489 --> 01:30:38,489
Okay.

846
01:30:39,489 --> 01:30:42,209
I'll see her before the Friday prayers.

847
01:31:16,769 --> 01:31:17,769
Bamsı.

848
01:31:18,569 --> 01:31:20,049
Don't play with them.

849
01:31:23,289 --> 01:31:25,089
All right.

850
01:31:25,489 --> 01:31:27,249
I'll go anyway.

851
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:29,769
It's late.

852
01:31:30,689 --> 01:31:31,729
Hafsa waits for me.

853
01:31:32,649 --> 01:31:33,649
Artuk Bey,

854
01:31:34,729 --> 01:31:37,169
marriage is such a good thing.

855
01:31:37,889 --> 01:31:38,889
What do you say?

856
01:31:40,289 --> 01:31:41,969
Don't you think about it?

857
01:31:43,329 --> 01:31:45,889
I never thought about marriage
all these years.

858
01:31:46,889 --> 01:31:47,929
I chose science.

859
01:31:49,809 --> 01:31:54,009
Look, you work so hard
all the time.

860
01:31:54,529 --> 01:32:00,529
Would it be so bad to have a wife
and babies in your tent?

861
01:32:01,929 --> 01:32:05,369
Bamsı. Enough. I'm working.

862
01:32:07,769 --> 01:32:09,129
Artuk Bey.

863
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:10,649
Artuk Bey.

864
01:32:11,489 --> 01:32:13,249
Marriage is the real science.

865
01:32:14,049 --> 01:32:18,529
Wise is the man who can get along
with a woman and raise kids.

866
01:32:19,129 --> 01:32:21,969
Artuk Bey,
talking about the babies,

867
01:32:22,489 --> 01:32:27,649
if there were many little Artuks,
lots of little Artuks,

868
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,649
you could teach them.

869
01:32:30,889 --> 01:32:32,889
You should get married, Artuk Bey.

870
01:32:33,449 --> 01:32:38,809
If you dedicated yourself to science,
you must raise educated kids.

871
01:32:41,729 --> 01:32:42,729
Alps.

872
01:32:47,369 --> 01:32:49,369
Bamsı Alp will leave now.

873
01:32:49,849 --> 01:32:52,689
When he leaves, don't let anyone in.

874
01:32:52,769 --> 01:32:54,369
As you order.

875
01:32:55,569 --> 01:32:57,209
Good.

876
01:32:57,769 --> 01:32:58,769
I'll go.

877
01:33:00,049 --> 01:33:03,849
Keep working Artuk Bey. Work hard.

878
01:33:04,369 --> 01:33:06,369
And when you want some soup,

879
01:33:06,609 --> 01:33:10,649
these papers will bring it to you
right away.

880
01:33:12,329 --> 01:33:13,329
Alps.

881
01:33:57,209 --> 01:33:58,209
Ares and Titan.

882
01:33:58,929 --> 01:33:59,929
At last.

883
01:34:11,329 --> 01:34:13,449
They're with the Tekfur's commander.

884
01:34:15,329 --> 01:34:19,729
Those who wish to die at the battle
of the Hanlı Bazaar, take a step forward.

885
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:31,009
As long as I have such brave men,

886
01:34:31,769 --> 01:34:36,409
killing Ertuğrul or driving the Turks away
will be easy.

887
01:34:37,809 --> 01:34:40,729
Ertuğrul will go to the Hanlı Bazaar
tomorrow to meet the traders.

888
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:43,769
Yanis and you three,

889
01:34:44,489 --> 01:34:47,329
you'll go there tonight dressed
as merchants.

890
01:34:49,529 --> 01:34:53,929
Spend the night there
and hide your swords under the tables.

891
01:34:55,609 --> 01:35:00,289
Me and the other soldiers will go in
when Ertuğrul comes, using the chaos.

892
01:35:00,729 --> 01:35:01,729
Scum.

893
01:35:02,529 --> 01:35:04,209
They'll ambush Ertuğrul Bey.

894
01:35:05,089 --> 01:35:10,009
When we go to the Hanlı Bazaar,
Titan will bring men from Bilecik.

895
01:35:10,449 --> 01:35:15,129
When it starts, our soldiers will surround
the Hanlı Bazaar.

896
01:35:16,729 --> 01:35:21,809
At last, we'll take our revenge from
Ertuğrul who killed many of our heroes.

897
01:35:38,045 --> 01:35:39,845
<i>Bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

898
01:35:48,765 --> 01:35:49,965
Mother.

899
01:35:51,085 --> 01:35:52,405
Come, my brave son.

900
01:35:53,645 --> 01:35:54,965
Come, the light of my eye.

901
01:36:03,045 --> 01:36:05,525
How are you, Mother?
Is there anything you need?

902
01:36:06,045 --> 01:36:07,765
Thank God for this day.

903
01:36:10,245 --> 01:36:11,245
What is it, Mother?

904
01:36:11,925 --> 01:36:12,965
Is something the matter?

905
01:36:13,645 --> 01:36:14,645
No, my son.

906
01:36:15,045 --> 01:36:15,925
No, I'm fine.

907
01:36:17,245 --> 01:36:19,565
I'm fine. I know you worry.

908
01:36:21,245 --> 01:36:23,125
But don't you worry.

909
01:36:26,925 --> 01:36:27,925
Well,

910
01:36:28,405 --> 01:36:29,605
I have grown old.

911
01:36:30,965 --> 01:36:32,405
It is almost time...

912
01:36:33,605 --> 01:36:34,885
for me to ride...

913
01:36:36,045 --> 01:36:38,285
the horse of fate to the other side.

914
01:36:38,445 --> 01:36:39,445
Don't say that, Mother.

915
01:36:39,765 --> 01:36:41,165
May God keep you with us.

916
01:36:43,365 --> 01:36:45,205
It is so, my son.

917
01:36:48,205 --> 01:36:49,205
In this world,

918
01:36:50,725 --> 01:36:52,565
I have seen my share of hardship.

919
01:36:53,805 --> 01:36:56,325
Thanks to your father, Suleyman Shah,

920
01:36:58,525 --> 01:36:59,685
and thanks to you,

921
01:37:00,805 --> 01:37:02,365
I have been proud many times.

922
01:37:04,965 --> 01:37:08,445
I finally saw you conquer
this castle, too.

923
01:37:12,485 --> 01:37:14,365
If I am to have one last wish,

924
01:37:17,045 --> 01:37:20,445
it would be to see my sons together.

925
01:37:25,805 --> 01:37:26,845
Let me see us...

926
01:37:28,285 --> 01:37:31,005
celebrate our victory altogether.

927
01:37:32,205 --> 01:37:33,525
My Sungur Tekin,

928
01:37:35,805 --> 01:37:36,805
my Gündoğdu,

929
01:37:38,765 --> 01:37:40,005
my Dündar.

930
01:37:42,245 --> 01:37:43,485
Let them come here.

931
01:37:46,165 --> 01:37:49,245
Still, you know what's best, my son.

932
01:37:50,605 --> 01:37:51,605
However,

933
01:37:52,605 --> 01:37:53,845
that is my wish.

934
01:37:59,725 --> 01:38:00,645
Mother,

935
01:38:01,845 --> 01:38:03,725
Just be all right.

936
01:38:04,925 --> 01:38:07,565
I will send a messenger
to my brothers right away.

937
01:38:12,165 --> 01:38:13,805
May God look upon you.

938
01:38:17,845 --> 01:38:19,645
May God take from my life

939
01:38:20,085 --> 01:38:21,445
and give to you, my son.

940
01:38:22,085 --> 01:38:23,085
Don't say that, Mother.

941
01:38:23,885 --> 01:38:24,885
Don't say that.

942
01:38:54,525 --> 01:38:55,805
Come on, brave men.

943
01:38:56,685 --> 01:38:58,845
We need to tell Ertuğrul Bey. Come on.

944
01:39:06,045 --> 01:39:07,045
Spies!

945
01:39:12,805 --> 01:39:15,485
Spies! Don't let them get away,
go after them.

946
01:39:15,725 --> 01:39:17,005
Commanders, stay here.

947
01:39:17,325 --> 01:39:18,325
Come on.

948
01:39:20,365 --> 01:39:21,845
Everybody look around.

949
01:39:29,565 --> 01:39:30,925
Come on, no time to rest.

950
01:39:31,085 --> 01:39:33,965
We need to get to Ertuğrul Bey
to prevent the infidels' plan.

951
01:39:53,565 --> 01:39:54,485
Damn.

952
01:40:03,725 --> 01:40:04,725
Titan!

953
01:40:04,925 --> 01:40:06,205
We can't let him get away.

954
01:40:06,405 --> 01:40:09,365
Ertuğrul will find out everything.
We need to get him, dead or alive.

955
01:40:09,525 --> 01:40:11,045
Knights, to your horses.

956
01:40:34,245 --> 01:40:35,645
Are the documents done, Artuk Bey?

957
01:40:36,085 --> 01:40:37,085
Almost, my bey.

958
01:40:37,325 --> 01:40:39,245
We are arranging them all with great care.

959
01:40:39,925 --> 01:40:42,485
Marya Hatun is of great help, praise her.

960
01:40:43,605 --> 01:40:44,765
Good.

961
01:40:45,365 --> 01:40:46,925
Marya Hatun is a clever woman.

962
01:40:47,965 --> 01:40:49,765
She quickly integrated with us.

963
01:40:50,325 --> 01:40:51,325
She did, my bey.

964
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:53,765
She is eager to learn.

965
01:40:54,205 --> 01:40:55,605
She doesn't have any family.

966
01:40:56,565 --> 01:40:58,605
I wish she would have a home.

967
01:40:59,445 --> 01:41:01,605
Bear children, have a family.

968
01:41:02,525 --> 01:41:04,805
I wish to hand her over
to a competent man.

969
01:41:05,565 --> 01:41:06,925
That would be wise, my bey.

970
01:41:07,805 --> 01:41:09,405
Is there someone on your mind?

971
01:41:10,765 --> 01:41:11,765
Yes, Artuk Bey.

972
01:41:13,405 --> 01:41:14,485
You are on my mind.

973
01:41:17,365 --> 01:41:18,365
Me?

974
01:41:22,045 --> 01:41:23,045
Well, my bey,

975
01:41:23,725 --> 01:41:24,965
I don't know what to say.

976
01:41:27,525 --> 01:41:28,525
Artuk Bey,

977
01:41:29,565 --> 01:41:33,485
your home, too, should be filled
with your children.

978
01:41:35,245 --> 01:41:36,245
My bey,

979
01:41:37,045 --> 01:41:39,925
all these years, I never thought
of getting married.

980
01:41:40,805 --> 01:41:42,085
I dedicated myself to knowledge.

981
01:41:43,325 --> 01:41:44,645
I don't know how this will work.

982
01:41:45,685 --> 01:41:48,085
It will do good. It will be for the best.

983
01:41:49,325 --> 01:41:52,245
Our prophet ordered his ummah

984
01:41:52,645 --> 01:41:54,125
to marry and reproduce.

985
01:41:55,525 --> 01:41:57,445
Marya too has knowledge.

986
01:41:58,285 --> 01:42:01,245
You are the best match for each other.

987
01:42:03,205 --> 01:42:04,205
My bey,

988
01:42:04,565 --> 01:42:06,725
will Marya accept?

989
01:42:08,165 --> 01:42:09,525
She has, Artuk Bey.

990
01:42:10,365 --> 01:42:12,405
Halime Hatun has spoken with Marya Hatun.

991
01:42:13,245 --> 01:42:14,965
If you accept too,

992
01:42:15,485 --> 01:42:16,485
after the celebration<i>,</i>

993
01:42:16,925 --> 01:42:17,925
I wish to...

994
01:42:18,805 --> 01:42:19,845
honor our victory

995
01:42:20,205 --> 01:42:22,045
with your engagement.

996
01:42:23,605 --> 01:42:26,445
Well, if Marya accepts, too...

997
01:42:29,965 --> 01:42:31,325
As you wish, my bey.

998
01:42:33,405 --> 01:42:34,405
Thank you.

999
01:42:35,765 --> 01:42:37,885
May it be for the best then, Artuk Bey.

1000
01:42:38,325 --> 01:42:39,325
I am very pleased.

1001
01:42:43,005 --> 01:42:44,005
Grandmother,

1002
01:42:44,165 --> 01:42:46,165
when will my uncles come?

1003
01:42:47,245 --> 01:42:49,885
Your father sent the fastest messengers.

1004
01:42:50,445 --> 01:42:54,165
Your uncles will hit the road
as soon as they receive the invite.

1005
01:42:54,845 --> 01:42:55,845
God willing.

1006
01:43:03,245 --> 01:43:04,245
Grandmother,

1007
01:43:04,925 --> 01:43:06,525
I never knew my grandfather.

1008
01:43:07,005 --> 01:43:08,725
Tell me about him a little.

1009
01:43:10,285 --> 01:43:12,605
I wouldn't know how to tell you.

1010
01:43:16,805 --> 01:43:17,885
The roads he rode,

1011
01:43:18,925 --> 01:43:20,485
the mountains he passed,

1012
01:43:21,485 --> 01:43:23,325
should tell you about him.

1013
01:43:25,805 --> 01:43:28,485
He didn't give in to the cruel...

1014
01:43:29,965 --> 01:43:31,405
and he helped the oppressed.

1015
01:43:33,565 --> 01:43:36,125
Those who saw his shadow
would pay respect...

1016
01:43:39,045 --> 01:43:42,565
and his enemies would search
for a place to hide.

1017
01:43:44,845 --> 01:43:46,165
He roared like a lion,

1018
01:43:47,605 --> 01:43:48,725
walked like a wolf...

1019
01:43:50,125 --> 01:43:51,445
and had the eyes of an eagle.

1020
01:43:53,525 --> 01:43:55,725
In the field of battle,
he was unrivaled...

1021
01:43:57,005 --> 01:43:59,765
and he brought the backs
of many a wrestler to the ground.

1022
01:44:06,485 --> 01:44:07,885
That which Suleyman Shah said...

1023
01:44:08,925 --> 01:44:10,125
wasn't possible...

1024
01:44:12,165 --> 01:44:14,845
has never been proven possible
by a single soul.

1025
01:44:17,645 --> 01:44:20,045
He gave me sons as valiant
as your father...

1026
01:44:23,005 --> 01:44:25,485
and grandsons like you.

1027
01:44:30,365 --> 01:44:32,765
May God bless him, my dear.

1028
01:44:34,925 --> 01:44:35,925
Amen.

1029
01:44:46,005 --> 01:44:47,885
How many sons do you have, Grandmother?

1030
01:44:50,885 --> 01:44:52,165
I had six sons.

1031
01:44:54,685 --> 01:44:57,445
Two were killed in the war
against the Mongols.

1032
01:44:59,765 --> 01:45:01,325
How many grandsons do you have?

1033
01:45:03,565 --> 01:45:04,805
Your uncle Gündoğdu...

1034
01:45:05,405 --> 01:45:06,405
has two sons.

1035
01:45:07,685 --> 01:45:10,405
And you uncle Sungur Tekin has one son.

1036
01:45:12,405 --> 01:45:14,525
Me, one and Savcı...

1037
01:45:14,925 --> 01:45:17,365
Then you have five grandsons, Grandmother.

1038
01:45:18,445 --> 01:45:19,765
Right.

1039
01:45:21,205 --> 01:45:25,405
I have five grandsons,
smart like you, my dear.

1040
01:45:25,765 --> 01:45:28,125
I hope they come soon.

1041
01:45:29,005 --> 01:45:30,845
I've never seen them.

1042
01:45:31,365 --> 01:45:32,525
I wish to know them.

1043
01:45:33,325 --> 01:45:34,525
God willing, my boy.

1044
01:45:38,845 --> 01:45:40,925
What's wrong, Grandmother?
Are you all right?

1045
01:45:41,565 --> 01:45:42,565
I'm fine.

1046
01:45:43,885 --> 01:45:45,165
I'm fine, my dear.

1047
01:45:45,645 --> 01:45:47,125
I'm fine.

1048
01:45:48,245 --> 01:45:49,245
You go,

1049
01:45:49,445 --> 01:45:50,885
be with your brother.

1050
01:45:53,245 --> 01:45:54,805
Let me rest a little, eh?

1051
01:45:55,445 --> 01:45:56,445
Okay.

1052
01:45:56,605 --> 01:45:57,605
Okay, Grandmother.

1053
01:45:57,845 --> 01:45:58,885
Oh!

1054
01:46:00,605 --> 01:46:01,965
Oh, I'd die for you.

1055
01:46:02,645 --> 01:46:04,205
I'd die for you.

1056
01:46:04,885 --> 01:46:05,885
Come on.

1057
01:47:03,645 --> 01:47:04,645
Go.

1058
01:47:21,485 --> 01:47:22,645
Go on.

1059
01:47:27,005 --> 01:47:28,005
Stop.

1060
01:47:45,765 --> 01:47:46,765
Go.

1061
01:49:09,045 --> 01:49:10,805
On this sacred Friday,

1062
01:49:11,605 --> 01:49:14,245
at this time that prayers are heard,

1063
01:49:14,565 --> 01:49:19,205
we thank God that with your effort,
believers who have come together,

1064
01:49:20,085 --> 01:49:21,925
and the help of our God,

1065
01:49:23,725 --> 01:49:26,405
it has befallen us to perform
Friday prayers here.

1066
01:49:27,405 --> 01:49:32,045
God willing, all your generations
may perform Friday prayers here forever.

1067
01:49:32,205 --> 01:49:33,245
Amen.

1068
01:49:34,445 --> 01:49:36,445
As our great prophet says...

1069
01:49:36,645 --> 01:49:38,405
Peace be upon him.

1070
01:49:38,845 --> 01:49:40,605
"Islam is good morality.

1071
01:49:41,845 --> 01:49:43,845
A Muslim is someone...

1072
01:49:44,405 --> 01:49:46,405
whose word and work is true.

1073
01:49:48,765 --> 01:49:51,285
Conquering a castle is important business.

1074
01:49:53,165 --> 01:49:56,525
But the important thing
is to conquer the castle of hearts."

1075
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:00,925
Our prophet says...

1076
01:50:01,125 --> 01:50:03,125
Peace be upon him.

1077
01:50:04,485 --> 01:50:07,165
"If people look at your conduct

1078
01:50:07,325 --> 01:50:09,445
and do not aspire to Islam,

1079
01:50:11,205 --> 01:50:13,005
review your faith."

1080
01:50:15,565 --> 01:50:17,965
Just as you raised our glorious banner

1081
01:50:18,605 --> 01:50:20,765
and made this place an Islamic land,

1082
01:50:21,925 --> 01:50:24,925
you are required to make people feel...

1083
01:50:25,685 --> 01:50:27,845
the encompassing warmth of Islam

1084
01:50:28,085 --> 01:50:30,165
with your just and merciful behavior.

1085
01:50:31,445 --> 01:50:34,845
Our Lord says in the Surah Ali Imran:

1086
01:50:35,885 --> 01:50:39,325
"If you had been mean and cold-hearted,

1087
01:50:40,365 --> 01:50:43,165
it is with no doubt that they would
leave you."

1088
01:50:44,965 --> 01:50:46,325
Venerable believers,

1089
01:50:47,365 --> 01:50:50,565
as God commands, we shall...

1090
01:50:51,165 --> 01:50:54,005
be kind towards the oppressed.

1091
01:50:55,005 --> 01:50:58,645
However, against the cruel,
we shall always be resolute.

1092
01:50:59,685 --> 01:51:02,845
To live in harmony with unity
and prosperity,

1093
01:51:04,325 --> 01:51:07,125
we will firmly embrace this line
from the Quran...

1094
01:51:09,925 --> 01:51:14,445
and walk a righteous path
with the guidance of our prophet.

1095
01:51:15,725 --> 01:51:17,765
May God bless your Friday prayer.

1096
01:51:17,925 --> 01:51:19,085
Amen.

1097
01:51:20,085 --> 01:51:22,605
-May your conquest be blessed.
-Amen.

1098
01:52:03,005 --> 01:52:04,005
Merchant Niko.

1099
01:52:04,525 --> 01:52:05,885
I caught you at last.

1100
01:52:12,685 --> 01:52:13,685
Not Niko,

1101
01:52:15,325 --> 01:52:16,325
Atsız.

1102
01:52:16,885 --> 01:52:18,285
You still haven't learned.

1103
01:52:34,965 --> 01:52:37,085
You won't be able
to tell Ertuğrul this time.

1104
01:52:46,765 --> 01:52:47,765
Bastards.

1105
01:52:50,085 --> 01:52:52,205
You only know how to fight dirty.

1106
01:53:41,485 --> 01:53:43,165
You truly are a great spy,

1107
01:53:44,405 --> 01:53:47,805
a spy good enough to get near me.
But don't forget...

1108
01:53:48,565 --> 01:53:49,965
that I am a great warrior.

1109
01:53:50,765 --> 01:53:52,085
And I won this game.

1110
01:53:53,925 --> 01:53:56,685
Who knows how upset Ertuğrul will be
when he loses such a spy.

1111
01:53:57,125 --> 01:53:58,885
No matter what traps you set,

1112
01:54:00,565 --> 01:54:01,565
Ertuğrul Bey...

1113
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:04,685
will do away with you all.

1114
01:54:09,565 --> 01:54:12,005
Your rule of these lands is over.

1115
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:20,165
Keep on resisting.

1116
01:54:20,965 --> 01:54:23,285
I will have you beg for your life.

1117
01:54:27,445 --> 01:54:28,485
Do what you will.

1118
01:54:30,965 --> 01:54:33,325
But the last breath of a Turk...

1119
01:54:36,565 --> 01:54:37,605
will not be for mercy...

1120
01:54:39,205 --> 01:54:40,205
but the proud smile...

1121
01:54:41,725 --> 01:54:43,085
of martyrdom.

1122
01:56:02,805 --> 01:56:04,685
Our margrave, Ertuğrul Bey.

1123
01:56:10,285 --> 01:56:13,365
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you.

1124
01:56:18,045 --> 01:56:19,805
<i>Bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

1125
01:56:29,845 --> 01:56:31,445
Welcome, my beys.

1126
01:56:31,725 --> 01:56:33,525
Glad to be here, Ertuğrul Bey.

1127
01:56:37,965 --> 01:56:38,965
Sit.

1128
01:56:47,325 --> 01:56:48,685
In the 99 names...

1129
01:56:49,525 --> 01:56:50,565
of God,

1130
01:56:50,685 --> 01:56:54,325
who makes things happen
and fills our hearts with faith,

1131
01:56:56,405 --> 01:56:58,085
may our celebration be<i>...</i>

1132
01:56:58,605 --> 01:57:00,925
for the best and for good fortune.

1133
01:57:01,085 --> 01:57:02,605
Amen.

1134
01:57:03,365 --> 01:57:05,485
When you broke the infidels
on our doorstep,

1135
01:57:06,325 --> 01:57:09,005
our tribes and families
were filled with joy.

1136
01:57:09,685 --> 01:57:11,125
Ertuğrul Bey, may God...

1137
01:57:11,925 --> 01:57:13,965
further your victories and your name.

1138
01:57:14,925 --> 01:57:17,445
-Thank you.
-May your victories be lasting.

1139
01:57:17,845 --> 01:57:18,845
Thank you.

1140
01:57:19,285 --> 01:57:20,285
Thank you.

1141
01:57:22,405 --> 01:57:23,405
Victory...

1142
01:57:24,005 --> 01:57:25,205
is God's, my beys.

1143
01:57:26,285 --> 01:57:27,405
Name and reputation...

1144
01:57:28,085 --> 01:57:30,445
are transient matters of the world.

1145
01:57:31,245 --> 01:57:32,245
Our fight...

1146
01:57:32,685 --> 01:57:34,085
and our conquests...

1147
01:57:34,645 --> 01:57:36,525
are for the grace of God.

1148
01:57:37,845 --> 01:57:40,525
And we gather here today to share this...

1149
01:57:41,645 --> 01:57:45,205
and to consult on the new order.

1150
01:57:45,565 --> 01:57:47,245
Yes, Ertuğrul Bey.

1151
01:57:56,325 --> 01:57:57,325
Ertuğrul Bey,

1152
01:57:57,565 --> 01:57:59,965
Sultan Alaeddin's lieutenant has arrived.

1153
01:58:01,125 --> 01:58:02,205
Bring him in, Abdur Rahman.

1154
01:58:24,565 --> 01:58:25,565
Welcome.

1155
01:58:25,765 --> 01:58:26,925
You are most welcome.

1156
01:58:27,285 --> 01:58:28,285
Glad to be here.

1157
01:58:28,525 --> 01:58:30,325
May your celebration be blessed,
Ertuğrul Bey.

1158
01:58:30,725 --> 01:58:31,725
Thank you.

1159
01:58:31,885 --> 01:58:34,565
I bring you Sultan Alaeddin's...

1160
01:58:35,045 --> 01:58:37,605
conquest gifts and edict.

1161
01:58:49,765 --> 01:58:52,365
If it would please you, I'd like to read
our sultan's edict...

1162
01:58:52,885 --> 01:58:54,165
to the beys.

1163
01:58:58,965 --> 01:58:59,965
Please do.

1164
01:59:14,725 --> 01:59:18,845
"Ertuğrul Bey, Bey of the Kayi,
son of Suleyman Shah.

1165
01:59:19,245 --> 01:59:20,885
May God render your sword sharp,

1166
01:59:21,645 --> 01:59:24,805
your victories perpetual,
your life fruitful.

1167
01:59:25,725 --> 01:59:27,965
The conquest of Karacahisar,

1168
01:59:28,365 --> 01:59:30,045
through the gallantry of you
and your alps,

1169
01:59:30,165 --> 01:59:32,005
has increased the power of our state.

1170
01:59:32,445 --> 01:59:33,805
Following this conquest,

1171
01:59:34,365 --> 01:59:35,365
henceforth,

1172
01:59:35,925 --> 01:59:41,005
I give you Domaniç for the summer
and Söğüt for the winter.

1173
01:59:42,085 --> 01:59:44,445
The rule and the protection of these lands

1174
01:59:44,685 --> 01:59:45,925
are under your command.

1175
01:59:46,645 --> 01:59:50,045
Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad the Victorious."

1176
01:59:50,245 --> 01:59:53,885
-May it be for the best, my bey.
-Thank you.

1177
01:59:54,165 --> 01:59:56,125
May God bless you, my bey.

1178
01:59:56,765 --> 02:00:00,285
May God give you the strength
to do what you wish.

1179
02:00:01,085 --> 02:00:02,085
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

1180
02:00:02,405 --> 02:00:03,565
May our offspring be wolves...

1181
02:00:04,245 --> 02:00:06,365
and everywhere we set foot be our land.

1182
02:00:06,965 --> 02:00:07,965
Thank you, brother.

1183
02:00:08,445 --> 02:00:09,765
You are our state's protector,

1184
02:00:10,325 --> 02:00:12,645
the pride of the Turk tribes,
Ertuğrul Bey.

1185
02:00:13,365 --> 02:00:15,325
May God render you always victorious.

1186
02:00:15,645 --> 02:00:18,125
-Amen.
-May God bless you, my bey.

1187
02:00:19,925 --> 02:00:21,125
Thank you, my beys.

1188
02:00:21,765 --> 02:00:22,765
Thank you.

1189
02:00:23,045 --> 02:00:25,485
May our state stand tall.

1190
02:00:26,245 --> 02:00:27,685
As our sultan commanded,

1191
02:00:28,485 --> 02:00:29,485
from now on,

1192
02:00:29,845 --> 02:00:31,245
Söğüt and Domaniç...

1193
02:00:31,885 --> 02:00:34,125
are our lands.

1194
02:00:35,045 --> 02:00:39,205
We will start working on the improvement
of these places right away.

1195
02:00:40,085 --> 02:00:42,485
And I shall soon ride to Konya

1196
02:00:42,965 --> 02:00:46,245
to surrender our sultan's
right to the spoils.

1197
02:00:47,205 --> 02:00:48,205
Soon.

1198
02:00:51,445 --> 02:00:53,565
Now, let us eat.

1199
02:00:54,085 --> 02:00:55,085
Come, sit.

1200
02:01:00,965 --> 02:01:02,485
<i>Bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

1201
02:01:02,645 --> 02:01:03,925
<i>Bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

1202
02:01:16,725 --> 02:01:19,485
<i>Look at the bride</i>

1203
02:01:19,725 --> 02:01:22,485
<i>She has henna on her hands</i>

1204
02:01:22,885 --> 02:01:25,685
<i>Don't say anything to her</i>

1205
02:01:26,045 --> 02:01:28,925
<i>She'll be offended and go back home</i>

1206
02:01:29,245 --> 02:01:32,085
<i>Henna on her door</i>

1207
02:01:32,485 --> 02:01:35,365
<i>She is an angel</i>

1208
02:01:35,685 --> 02:01:38,965
<i>-May your bridal henna be merry</i>
<i>-Bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

1209
02:01:39,085 --> 02:01:41,885
<i>May your prosperity be sweet</i>

1210
02:01:42,285 --> 02:01:45,085
<i>Look at the bride</i>

1211
02:01:45,405 --> 02:01:48,245
<i>She has henna on her hand</i>

1212
02:02:17,765 --> 02:02:18,885
Who are you?

1213
02:02:19,965 --> 02:02:22,725
We are merchants. We wish to spend
the night.

1214
02:02:23,085 --> 02:02:24,165
Where do you come from?

1215
02:02:26,645 --> 02:02:29,125
We come to Hanli Bazaar
from Söğüt to trade.

1216
02:02:29,685 --> 02:02:33,805
We heard that Ertuğrul Bey will
accept merchants here tomorrow.

1217
02:02:34,645 --> 02:02:37,645
We would like to stay here
and meet him in person.

1218
02:02:38,525 --> 02:02:41,685
All right, then. Surrender your swords
and daggers.

1219
02:02:42,005 --> 02:02:43,405
Then you may come inside.

1220
02:03:00,525 --> 02:03:02,965
<i>Henna on her door</i>

1221
02:03:03,325 --> 02:03:05,885
<i>She is an angel</i>

1222
02:03:06,365 --> 02:03:09,285
<i>-May your bridal henna be merry</i>
-God willing, may you have

1223
02:03:09,685 --> 02:03:12,205
armies of sons and tribes of daughters.

1224
02:03:13,445 --> 02:03:15,125
May your home be prosperous.

1225
02:03:15,325 --> 02:03:17,885
<i>She has henna on her hand</i>

1226
02:03:18,285 --> 02:03:19,285
This...

1227
02:03:20,445 --> 02:03:22,245
is our wedding gift to you.

1228
02:03:24,485 --> 02:03:27,005
<i>Her door has henna</i>

1229
02:03:27,285 --> 02:03:29,765
-Halime.
-I'll put it on, Mother.

1230
02:03:30,285 --> 02:03:33,085
<i>May your bridal henna be merry</i>

1231
02:03:33,325 --> 02:03:36,005
<i>May your prosperity be sweet</i>

1232
02:03:36,285 --> 02:03:38,925
<i>Look at the bride</i>

1233
02:03:39,245 --> 02:03:42,765
<i>-She has henna on her hand</i>
-I don't know what to say.

1234
02:03:44,685 --> 02:03:46,245
You've made me so happy.

1235
02:03:47,085 --> 02:03:48,485
You are so beautiful, Marya.

1236
02:03:49,165 --> 02:03:51,085
May God protect you from evil eyes.

1237
02:03:51,205 --> 02:03:52,445
-Amen.
-Amen.

1238
02:03:53,005 --> 02:03:54,005
Thank you.

1239
02:03:54,965 --> 02:03:56,725
You've helped me so much.

1240
02:03:57,525 --> 02:03:58,805
I appreciate it.

1241
02:04:01,005 --> 02:04:02,005
I wish...

1242
02:04:02,325 --> 02:04:03,605
my brother was here...

1243
02:04:05,405 --> 02:04:06,525
to see this day.

1244
02:04:07,645 --> 02:04:08,645
Marya Hatun,

1245
02:04:09,565 --> 02:04:10,565
don't be sad.

1246
02:04:11,365 --> 02:04:13,405
And don't feel alone.

1247
02:04:14,565 --> 02:04:15,965
You lost your brother.

1248
02:04:16,965 --> 02:04:18,565
But if we may,

1249
02:04:18,885 --> 02:04:21,605
we would like to be your sisters.

1250
02:04:23,925 --> 02:04:26,565
<i>Look at the bride</i>

1251
02:04:26,845 --> 02:04:29,405
<i>-She has henna on her hand</i>
-You are such good people.

1252
02:04:31,605 --> 02:04:34,605
I thank God that he led me to you.

1253
02:04:38,605 --> 02:04:39,605
Sit here.

1254
02:04:41,525 --> 02:04:44,325
Eat something. I will get
your quarters ready.

1255
02:04:44,405 --> 02:04:45,405
Thank you.

1256
02:04:45,645 --> 02:04:46,645
You're welcome.

1257
02:04:56,085 --> 02:04:58,045
Bring some food to this table.

1258
02:05:10,245 --> 02:05:13,045
Let's sneak down at night
and place the swords under the tables.

1259
02:05:14,765 --> 02:05:17,845
We will take our place inside
before Ertuğrul comes tomorrow.

1260
02:05:18,085 --> 02:05:19,765
Everybody knows what to do.

1261
02:05:27,245 --> 02:05:28,245
The emperor...

1262
02:05:29,045 --> 02:05:30,605
will do everything he can...

1263
02:05:31,165 --> 02:05:32,565
to take back...

1264
02:05:33,005 --> 02:05:34,845
Karacahisar Castle from us.

1265
02:05:35,365 --> 02:05:36,365
Ares...

1266
02:05:36,845 --> 02:05:38,565
and the governor of Bilecik...

1267
02:05:39,005 --> 02:05:41,045
will always threaten us.

1268
02:05:41,805 --> 02:05:44,365
That's why we have to get rid of Ares...

1269
02:05:45,325 --> 02:05:48,285
and conquer Bilecik.

1270
02:05:49,925 --> 02:05:53,885
The war between us will go on
until we end...

1271
02:05:55,085 --> 02:05:56,485
Nicaea's rule...

1272
02:05:57,125 --> 02:05:58,205
over these lands.

1273
02:06:11,445 --> 02:06:13,845
We await your command
and are always ready to fight,

1274
02:06:14,525 --> 02:06:16,125
Ertuğrul Bey.

1275
02:06:17,205 --> 02:06:18,205
Thank you.

1276
02:06:33,285 --> 02:06:36,325
This is a symbol of our endless allegiance
to you.

1277
02:06:37,165 --> 02:06:38,325
The moment you send this,

1278
02:06:38,605 --> 02:06:40,725
I will come under your command
with all my alps.

1279
02:06:41,405 --> 02:06:42,405
Thank you.

1280
02:07:06,365 --> 02:07:07,725
The basis of prosperity...

1281
02:07:08,285 --> 02:07:09,285
is unity.

1282
02:07:10,445 --> 02:07:13,605
I have no doubt that the Oğuz Beys
who have not rejected...

1283
02:07:14,045 --> 02:07:17,445
unity so far will not do so going forth.

1284
02:07:19,685 --> 02:07:20,685
I'd like to know...

1285
02:07:21,525 --> 02:07:24,965
what the newly arrived Cavdar beys
think of this matter.

1286
02:07:56,965 --> 02:07:59,085
We too are under your command,
Ertuğrul Bey.

1287
02:07:59,565 --> 02:08:02,165
We have come to accept Turgut Bey
as our bey.

1288
02:08:03,005 --> 02:08:04,005
Thank you.

1289
02:08:08,085 --> 02:08:09,085
Thank you.

1290
02:08:11,685 --> 02:08:12,685
Bamsi.

1291
02:08:13,325 --> 02:08:14,325
Give me an arrow.

1292
02:08:21,485 --> 02:08:22,485
He who...

1293
02:08:23,085 --> 02:08:24,525
isn't united...

1294
02:08:25,485 --> 02:08:27,685
and acts alone...

1295
02:08:29,605 --> 02:08:31,245
will break as easily as this.

1296
02:08:38,405 --> 02:08:39,405
However,

1297
02:08:40,245 --> 02:08:41,645
if we are one,

1298
02:08:42,365 --> 02:08:45,045
nobody can break us.

1299
02:08:51,365 --> 02:08:52,365
I would like...

1300
02:08:53,485 --> 02:08:56,405
to add joy to this day that we celebrate
our prosperity...

1301
02:08:57,205 --> 02:09:00,045
and unity with a wedding.

1302
02:09:02,525 --> 02:09:04,605
In front of all the beys,

1303
02:09:06,005 --> 02:09:09,125
we shall wed Artuk Bey and Marya.

1304
02:09:09,645 --> 02:09:11,805
Congratulations, Artuk Bey.

1305
02:09:11,925 --> 02:09:13,325
May it be for the best.

1306
02:09:14,485 --> 02:09:18,365
May you have armies of sons...
and tribes of daughters, Artuk Bey.

1307
02:09:18,965 --> 02:09:20,565
Thank you, Turgut Bey.

1308
02:09:21,765 --> 02:09:23,125
Thank you, my beys.

1309
02:09:24,805 --> 02:09:25,965
Thank you, my bey.

1310
02:09:27,085 --> 02:09:28,525
God bless you.

1311
02:09:30,205 --> 02:09:31,205
Bamsi.

1312
02:09:33,845 --> 02:09:36,565
Tell the women to bring Marya Hatun.

1313
02:09:36,845 --> 02:09:37,845
Yes, my bey.

1314
02:09:56,365 --> 02:09:57,685
This room is for two.

1315
02:09:58,365 --> 02:09:59,365
You have water.

1316
02:09:59,645 --> 02:10:02,645
If you need anything else,
there's an alp on guard.

1317
02:10:03,005 --> 02:10:05,445
-Call for him.
-You've hosted us well.

1318
02:10:05,725 --> 02:10:06,725
Thank you.

1319
02:10:07,405 --> 02:10:08,885
-Good night.
-You're welcome.

1320
02:10:09,165 --> 02:10:10,165
Good night.

1321
02:10:20,805 --> 02:10:24,485
I have wed you in front of the witnesses

1322
02:10:24,725 --> 02:10:25,845
and the people here.

1323
02:10:27,565 --> 02:10:29,325
May God bless your covenant.

1324
02:10:29,485 --> 02:10:30,565
Amen.

1325
02:10:30,765 --> 02:10:31,765
Oh, God.

1326
02:10:34,285 --> 02:10:37,485
We are witness to this wedding covenant.

1327
02:10:38,005 --> 02:10:39,165
You witness it too.

1328
02:10:39,565 --> 02:10:42,245
My God, bless this wedding covenant.

1329
02:10:42,765 --> 02:10:43,765
Amen.

1330
02:10:43,965 --> 02:10:45,725
Help this couple get along,

1331
02:10:46,165 --> 02:10:47,165
give them love

1332
02:10:47,325 --> 02:10:50,245
-and patience in marriage.
-Amen.

1333
02:10:50,805 --> 02:10:51,805
My God,

1334
02:10:52,325 --> 02:10:53,645
grant this couple...

1335
02:10:54,645 --> 02:10:56,725
the friendship, peace and happiness

1336
02:10:57,245 --> 02:10:59,045
that was among the prophet Adam...

1337
02:11:00,165 --> 02:11:03,565
and our mother, Eve,
among our prophet Muhammed,

1338
02:11:05,325 --> 02:11:07,325
may peace be upon him,

1339
02:11:08,005 --> 02:11:11,485
and our mother, Hatice,

1340
02:11:11,805 --> 02:11:15,525
-and among Ali and Fatima.
-Amen.

1341
02:11:16,165 --> 02:11:17,165
My God,

1342
02:11:17,285 --> 02:11:19,765
grant this couple suitable children,

1343
02:11:20,125 --> 02:11:24,365
-long life and plenty of livelihood.
-Amen.

1344
02:11:24,925 --> 02:11:29,125
Our God, grant us, in this world
and the next, blessed wellness

1345
02:11:29,205 --> 02:11:30,925
-and beauty.
-Amen.

1346
02:11:31,765 --> 02:11:34,525
-Protect us from hell fire.
-Amen.

1347
02:11:35,285 --> 02:11:36,285
Al-Fatiha.

1348
02:11:59,285 --> 02:12:01,125
After everyone settles in,

1349
02:12:01,205 --> 02:12:03,565
we will hide the swords
beneath the tables tonight.

1350
02:12:03,885 --> 02:12:07,085
When Ertuğrul comes tomorrow,
Ares will be here to finish him off.

1351
02:12:08,725 --> 02:12:09,805
<i>Come in.</i>

1352
02:12:13,485 --> 02:12:15,285
We risked everything coming here.

1353
02:12:16,445 --> 02:12:19,085
Ertuğrul must be celebrating victory
at the castle with his beys.

1354
02:12:21,325 --> 02:12:22,445
But tomorrow, this inn...

1355
02:12:23,765 --> 02:12:25,045
will be his grave.

1356
02:12:40,285 --> 02:12:42,165
May God render your union perpetual,
Artuk Bey.

1357
02:12:42,965 --> 02:12:44,845
May he soon give you valiant sons.

1358
02:12:45,205 --> 02:12:47,445
God bless you, my bey.

1359
02:12:47,565 --> 02:12:48,565
Thank you.

1360
02:12:57,445 --> 02:12:58,445
Artuk Bey,

1361
02:12:58,605 --> 02:13:01,165
may God further your lineage
and give you many children.

1362
02:13:02,045 --> 02:13:05,005
May God protect you from all evil.

1363
02:13:05,325 --> 02:13:06,965
Thank you, Turgut Alp.

1364
02:13:07,205 --> 02:13:08,205
Thank you.

1365
02:13:11,685 --> 02:13:12,845
May it be for the good.

1366
02:13:13,205 --> 02:13:14,525
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.

1367
02:13:16,485 --> 02:13:17,605
May it be for the good.

1368
02:13:17,845 --> 02:13:19,685
May God bless you, Artuk Bey.

1369
02:13:21,605 --> 02:13:22,925
May you have armies of sons...

1370
02:13:24,045 --> 02:13:26,485
and tribes of daughters. God willing.

1371
02:13:26,725 --> 02:13:28,245
Thank you, Hayme Hatun.

1372
02:13:28,405 --> 02:13:29,405
Thank you.

1373
02:13:31,405 --> 02:13:33,565
-May you be happy, Artuk Bey.
-Hayme Ana.

1374
02:13:33,885 --> 02:13:35,485
God bless you, Halime Sultan.

1375
02:13:36,845 --> 02:13:39,485
Thanks to you, I have found happiness.
Thank you.

1376
02:13:40,325 --> 02:13:41,325
Be happy, my girl.

1377
02:13:43,245 --> 02:13:45,405
May you always be happy, Artuk Bey.

1378
02:13:45,685 --> 02:13:48,085
Thank you, Aslıhan Hatun, thank you.

1379
02:13:53,005 --> 02:13:55,845
May you have little children, Artuk Bey.

1380
02:13:56,005 --> 02:13:57,285
Bring pride to our tribe.

1381
02:13:57,845 --> 02:13:58,845
Bamsi.

1382
02:13:58,925 --> 02:14:00,725
Come on, let's hug and celebrate.

1383
02:14:03,285 --> 02:14:04,285
Marya Hatun.

1384
02:14:16,605 --> 02:14:17,605
Mother.

1385
02:14:18,445 --> 02:14:20,285
-Mother!
-Hayme Ana.

1386
02:14:21,885 --> 02:14:22,965
-Wake up.
-Mother.

1387
02:14:23,125 --> 02:14:24,645
Mother.

1388
02:14:25,045 --> 02:14:26,045
Mother.

1389
02:14:26,925 --> 02:14:27,925
Grandmother.

1390
02:14:30,085 --> 02:14:31,085
I'd die...

1391
02:14:31,725 --> 02:14:32,725
for you.

1392
02:14:33,725 --> 02:14:35,245
Mother, come to.

1393
02:14:36,365 --> 02:14:37,365
Mother.

1394
02:14:39,485 --> 02:14:41,405
-Speak, Mother.
-Ertuğrul.

1395
02:14:42,045 --> 02:14:43,045
Son...

1396
02:14:46,125 --> 02:14:47,125
Son.

1397
02:14:50,605 --> 02:14:51,605
Give me...

1398
02:14:53,045 --> 02:14:54,045
Don't say that, Mother.

1399
02:14:54,285 --> 02:14:55,285
Don't.

1400
02:14:57,085 --> 02:14:58,685
Give me your...

1401
02:15:00,205 --> 02:15:01,205
Mother!

1402
02:15:03,565 --> 02:15:04,565
Mother!

1403
02:15:11,125 --> 02:15:12,125
Ble...

1404
02:15:13,205 --> 02:15:14,725
Bless...
