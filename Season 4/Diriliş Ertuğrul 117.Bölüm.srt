1
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:06,182
Artuk Bey...

2
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:09,782
How did we suddenly lose Halime Hatun?

3
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:14,662
An act of God, Günalp Bey.

4
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:18,022
She looked healthy.

5
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:24,542
But we've been having
a lot of trouble lately.

6
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:31,302
Even though Halime Hatun stood tall,

7
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:35,342
it seems that everything that happened
was too much for her.

8
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:39,342
Combining that with labor pain...

9
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:42,022
her heart couldn't take it.

10
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:51,822
That is very tough...

11
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:54,542
on our Bey.

12
00:03:57,262 --> 00:04:00,102
It's so difficult to say goodbye
to his wife

13
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:01,942
that he loves more than himself.

14
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:10,262
Even though he's trying to be strong...

15
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:12,902
it's not easy.

16
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,502
I know, brother.

17
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:24,502
It's so hard to overcome.

18
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:31,822
However...

19
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:35,102
our Bey knows...

20
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:38,902
the one who gives and takes is
the almighty God.

21
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,462
The only thing...

22
00:04:46,942 --> 00:04:48,942
we can do is to support our Bey.

23
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,222
My almighty God...

24
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:41,422
My Halime...

25
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:48,702
My gazelle-eyed...

26
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:52,662
faithful wife.

27
00:05:56,942 --> 00:05:58,382
The first one I saw...

28
00:06:00,982 --> 00:06:02,782
and fell in love with.

29
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,262
The owner of my white veil.

30
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:18,822
The hope of my heart.

31
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:48,662
Now will you leave our white pavilion
and go under the black earth?

32
00:06:57,342 --> 00:06:58,542
Why do I have...

33
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:05,782
to see you in a white shroud?

34
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:23,422
What am I going to do?

35
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:27,182
Where do I go?

36
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:30,382
Where do I go?

37
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:40,982
Now I'm grieving.

38
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:48,342
Now I'm suffering.

39
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:52,942
<i>The mother of my three children,</i>
<i>my gazelle-eyed wife.</i>

40
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:59,342
You made me happy in this world
with the three children you gave me.

41
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:08,862
My God granted me such a great destiny,

42
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:12,022
that I became the woman you love,

43
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:14,862
and the mother of your children.

44
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:40,302
The mother of my three children.

45
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:44,062
My brave wife.

46
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:54,302
Don't you worry.

47
00:08:57,782 --> 00:09:00,862
I'll take care of our children
that you entrusted me with.

48
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:11,422
You have stood tall...

49
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:15,462
against every trouble for so long.

50
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:18,902
You suffered so much.

51
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:24,222
You survived many hardships.

52
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:32,222
You took care of our village
and our children.

53
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:38,742
I...

54
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:42,502
Whatever I do,
I can't repay what you've done.

55
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,262
My gazelle-eyed mother.

56
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:20,702
My beautiful mother.

57
00:10:28,022 --> 00:10:29,182
Grandmother.

58
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:30,462
Huh?

59
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:33,702
My mother won't leave us alone, will she?

60
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:41,822
She has to see us become alps.

61
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:47,582
She'll see me carrying my wooden sword
and my armor.

62
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:53,062
She wanted to see my wedding.

63
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:56,262
She always told me so.

64
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:11,302
My brave boy.

65
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:16,822
You have to be strong.

66
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:19,462
You're the elder brother.

67
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:23,502
You are responsible for them.

68
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:29,102
You'll support and protect them.

69
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:34,942
What would they do if you act like this?

70
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,502
Even if I stand tall...

71
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:42,422
my brothers are so young, grandmother.

72
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:51,222
What would they do without my mother?

73
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:54,982
Osman is a newborn.

74
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:01,222
Don't worry, my brave boy.

75
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,862
God will help you.

76
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,702
If you let yourself go...

77
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:11,062
your mother and father
would be very sad.

78
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:16,302
I'll protect my brothers
with everything I have.

79
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:21,662
I won't let anyone harm Savcı and Osman.

80
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,582
Was I supposed to see...

81
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:09,782
the day that prayer would be said
for you, my Halime?

82
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:51,982
Come on, brother.

83
00:13:55,822 --> 00:13:58,102
Come on, Artuk Bey. It's time.

84
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,302
Can I come in, Bey?

85
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:30,422
Come in.

86
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,542
My Bey...

87
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:01,462
It's time.

88
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:48,702
My Gündüz.

89
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:54,182
Come on, it's time.

90
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:59,222
My mother is not dead,
you can't take her away.

91
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:02,342
I won't let her go!

92
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:04,662
Don't do that, son.

93
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:06,942
What did we just talk about?

94
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:10,662
No, grandmother.
They can't take my mother away.

95
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:13,742
My Gündüz!

96
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:19,142
You can't take her! I won't let you!

97
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:21,942
My gazelle-eyed mother.

98
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:25,582
My mother should be in the white pavilion,
not under the black earth.

99
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:31,622
I can't let my mother be
under the black earth, Father.

100
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,902
My brave boy, my son...

101
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:49,382
My Gündüz...

102
00:16:52,222 --> 00:16:54,902
God is the one that gives and takes.

103
00:17:00,702 --> 00:17:02,182
We can't do anything...

104
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:06,182
if that's what God wants.

105
00:17:09,782 --> 00:17:12,662
My beautiful mother.

106
00:17:13,862 --> 00:17:15,182
Don't leave us!

107
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,902
Know that...

108
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:20,902
death doesn't mean separation,
my Gündüz.

109
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:26,902
My beautiful mother,
my brother is asking for you.

110
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:30,062
Come on, get up!

111
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,942
The people who love each other...

112
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,902
meet in the afterlife.

113
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,342
Your mother is leaving now.

114
00:17:51,142 --> 00:17:53,662
But sooner or later,
we'll be there with her too.

115
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:57,742
My dear mother.

116
00:18:00,142 --> 00:18:02,382
Just as we are here together...

117
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:05,422
we'll be together there too.

118
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:15,582
And you have to protect your brothers.

119
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:21,422
Come on, my brave boy.

120
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:24,502
Pull yourself together.

121
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,262
Your mother would hate
to see you this way.

122
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,382
Be strong, my brave boy.

123
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:41,902
Be strong.

124
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,262
My beautiful mother.

125
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:48,622
My gazelle-eyed mother.

126
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,462
My gazelle-eyed mother.

127
00:18:54,982 --> 00:18:56,182
My son.

128
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,022
Our Osman needs milk.

129
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:06,542
We don't have any women in the village
who just gave birth. What will we do?

130
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:11,742
Artuk Bey...

131
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:14,302
Yes, Bey.

132
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,182
Let all the tribes know.

133
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:26,622
Osman needs milk.

134
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:29,142
Find someone.

135
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:31,342
Your wish is my command, Bey.

136
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,822
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

137
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:49,222
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

138
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:38,222
Welcome, traveler.

139
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:40,542
Thank you.

140
00:23:05,742 --> 00:23:08,422
Leave that plain Byzantine wine, Governor.

141
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:11,742
We'll drink Turks' blood now.

142
00:23:17,582 --> 00:23:19,902
-Turks' blood?
-Yes, Turks' blood.

143
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:21,982
And the darkest of them.

144
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:24,462
Ertuğrul's blood.

145
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:31,502
What are you trying to say?

146
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:33,982
Ertuğrul's wing is hurt, Governor.

147
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:36,422
Ertuğrul's wife died.

148
00:23:38,702 --> 00:23:41,262
And we'll break that wing off

149
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:44,422
before he can fly again.

150
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:47,462
I like what you say.

151
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:52,742
But I care more about fancy ideas
than fancy words.

152
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:59,102
Many scholars and merchants are
immigrating to Ertuğrul's land.

153
00:24:01,102 --> 00:24:04,342
Very soon, Turkish presence will get
stronger in these lands.

154
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:08,582
To prevent that,

155
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:11,102
we'll attack the merchants.

156
00:24:12,382 --> 00:24:15,822
What does that have to do
with drinking Ertuğrul's blood?

157
00:24:17,102 --> 00:24:20,342
Ertuğrul's spy, Ares-- I mean, Ahmet.

158
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,382
He'll let Ertuğrul know.

159
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,902
And Ertuğrul will try to ambush you.

160
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:33,582
But we'll be the ones to actually
set him up.

161
00:24:34,902 --> 00:24:36,502
Oh, Governor...

162
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:39,062
When you brought that Byzantine wine,

163
00:24:39,622 --> 00:24:43,262
and started to talk about Turkish blood,
you got much smarter.

164
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:45,142
Huh?

165
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:52,382
And in exchange, I'd like a gift from you.

166
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,822
Tell me.

167
00:24:56,182 --> 00:24:57,382
Ares.

168
00:24:58,342 --> 00:24:59,902
I'll cut off his head.

169
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,542
Where will we ambush him?

170
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:08,182
With a bright woman called Almıla.

171
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:10,502
In her own tannery.

172
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:15,048
Have you thought about this, traveler?

173
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:24,888
Commander Ares is here, sir.

174
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:26,448
Good.

175
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,128
He may come in.

176
00:26:35,408 --> 00:26:37,568
The hunter awaits his prey.

177
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:41,768
Don't worry, it's hunting season
for us both.

178
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:01,248
Who is this man?

179
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:04,208
A traveler.

180
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:08,168
You will know him soon.

181
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:11,888
Weird.

182
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:16,928
No matter.
You know that Ertuğrul's wife is dead.

183
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:19,088
Yes, I do.

184
00:27:20,728 --> 00:27:22,248
Ertuğrul is mourning now.

185
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:27,008
He's weak. We'll use this.

186
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:29,648
So, what will you do?

187
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,728
We'll attack, Ares.

188
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:40,328
The merchants are coming
to Ertuğrul's lands on his invitation.

189
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:46,768
This strengthens the Turkish presence
there.

190
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:48,568
We can't allow it.

191
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:51,288
So what, will you attack the merchants?

192
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:52,398
Yes.

193
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,808
A big tannery has been built.

194
00:27:56,368 --> 00:28:01,368
We'll attack there, kill the tanners
and destroy the tannery.

195
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,408
The merchants will fear us.

196
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:10,248
Ertuğrul will be hit once again
in his weakest moment.

197
00:28:12,528 --> 00:28:14,328
Good idea, Kritos.

198
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:16,888
Well thought out.

199
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:22,728
Good. Now, go and prepare.

200
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:31,608
Open the door.

201
00:29:43,128 --> 00:29:44,128
Ertuğrul will die.

202
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:49,128
And when he dies, we'll stay here
and hide ourselves.

203
00:29:50,568 --> 00:29:53,528
Until Noyan comes and invades these lands.

204
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:59,328
We're not here for Ertuğrul,
but for the Seljuk State, Mergen.

205
00:29:59,888 --> 00:30:01,368
Don't forget that.

206
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:28,528
What do the spirits say,
Bergütay?

207
00:31:57,688 --> 00:32:00,488
Where is Ertuğrul?

208
00:32:03,728 --> 00:32:06,168
Where is Ertuğrul?

209
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:10,528
What did you see? Speak!

210
00:32:20,728 --> 00:32:23,328
We'll prepare for the Governor's attack.

211
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:26,368
When Ertuğrul comes,
he and the Governor will die.

212
00:32:29,768 --> 00:32:32,408
We'll set Nicaea and the Seljuks
against each other.

213
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:37,008
Ertuğrul won't live long enough
to mourn Halime.

214
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:57,928
God is great.

215
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:03,728
May the peace and mercy of God
be upon you.

216
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,928
May the peace and mercy of God
be upon you.

217
00:33:11,808 --> 00:33:17,408
Al-Fatiha, for the soul of the deceased.

218
00:33:59,048 --> 00:34:02,168
Death only brings joy to the deceased

219
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,488
for the rest, it's pain.

220
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:06,968
Sorrow.

221
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:11,648
God Almighty says,

222
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:15,968
"All creatures will taste death.

223
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:21,688
You will come back to us."

224
00:34:25,928 --> 00:34:30,048
The deceased Halime Hatun was
a brave woman

225
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:33,688
who gave Ertuğrul Bey
three strong sons.

226
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:38,648
Maternity is such a holy duty...

227
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:43,608
that our Prophet,
a hadith in the sheriff said,

228
00:34:45,568 --> 00:34:48,888
"Heaven lies under the mother's feet."

229
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:56,208
Halime Hatun was a mother worthy of this.

230
00:34:58,128 --> 00:34:59,968
God grant her peace.

231
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,568
Amen!

232
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:07,248
Know that there is no separation
for lovers.

233
00:35:08,328 --> 00:35:10,528
Mortal life is temporary.

234
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,048
When your time here is over, you travel
to the other side.

235
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:18,968
We shall go there one day

236
00:35:20,528 --> 00:35:24,488
and hopefully, we will reunite
with our loved ones.

237
00:35:26,048 --> 00:35:28,888
May God consider us worthy
for both this world

238
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:32,408
and the other one!

239
00:35:32,888 --> 00:35:34,088
Amen!

240
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:11,088
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

241
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,168
Come on, Alps.

242
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:11,448
My bey, I know you're suffering.

243
00:40:13,768 --> 00:40:15,848
Allow us to stay with you.

244
00:40:18,088 --> 00:40:19,408
To share your pain.

245
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:27,728
Go to the village.

246
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,328
Protect the village.

247
00:40:35,488 --> 00:40:36,688
As you command.

248
00:41:12,648 --> 00:41:14,408
Son, come on.

249
00:41:15,448 --> 00:41:17,648
Time to stand up.

250
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:40,048
Your pain is fresh.

251
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:43,648
It's hard to resist.

252
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:49,208
But you must have patience.

253
00:41:50,368 --> 00:41:53,728
Your patience and strength will encourage
the people to do also.

254
00:41:55,968 --> 00:41:57,688
I don't care for my pain, but...

255
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:03,608
how can I make my three children
accept this?

256
00:42:07,408 --> 00:42:08,568
Our Prophet...

257
00:42:10,288 --> 00:42:13,008
has endured many sorrows of death.

258
00:42:14,128 --> 00:42:18,328
He lost his wife Hatice and his uncle
Abu Talib,

259
00:42:19,648 --> 00:42:22,328
which caused him great pain.

260
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:31,528
The pain was so great that,
the year when they both died was called

261
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,208
"The Year of Sorrow".

262
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:40,528
When Hatice died,
our Prophet had children.

263
00:42:41,568 --> 00:42:44,608
He took care of them himself.

264
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:47,568
Kept them safe.

265
00:42:50,128 --> 00:42:55,808
He never neglected them despite
numerous problems in the community.

266
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:06,208
You're the soldier of a just cause,
leader of the people.

267
00:43:07,648 --> 00:43:11,048
Everybody looks up to you for hope.

268
00:43:15,448 --> 00:43:19,488
If you can't stay strong
and fall into despair,

269
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:24,448
those who follow you will suffer
and get lost.

270
00:43:25,848 --> 00:43:28,448
No matter how hard I try to stay strong...

271
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,168
this test is too hard for me.

272
00:43:34,848 --> 00:43:41,288
But I know that I must obey fate.

273
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:49,568
God giveth, and God taketh away, son.

274
00:43:51,768 --> 00:43:53,608
If we praise him when he gives,

275
00:43:54,568 --> 00:43:57,088
we must be patient when he takes away.

276
00:44:00,328 --> 00:44:02,768
Holy God says in
the Surah Al-Baqarah...

277
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:07,688
"And We will surely test you
with fear and hunger

278
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:13,768
and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits,
but give good tidings to the patient,

279
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:20,928
who, when disaster strikes them, say,
'Indeed we belong to God

280
00:44:22,248 --> 00:44:26,688
and indeed to Him we will return.'"

281
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:33,688
That's why God shows mercy
and gives rewards.

282
00:44:36,968 --> 00:44:39,728
Those are the ones who found
the right path.

283
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:49,208
You risk your life for a just cause, Son.

284
00:44:54,288 --> 00:44:57,208
This is God's cause.

285
00:44:59,248 --> 00:45:03,488
This is such a holy cause that,
only the ones who have a strong faith

286
00:45:04,088 --> 00:45:07,528
can reach it.

287
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,808
This path is full of obstacles
and dangers.

288
00:45:14,248 --> 00:45:20,168
But at the end, it will give you
many rewards and blessings.

289
00:45:21,408 --> 00:45:25,208
Those who follow you in this cause,

290
00:45:25,928 --> 00:45:29,528
don't deserve to fall into despair.

291
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:38,488
As I said, I'm not me anymore.

292
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:45,528
Osman has no milk.

293
00:45:48,488 --> 00:45:50,728
He's hungry and wants food.

294
00:45:53,448 --> 00:45:57,048
I don't know how long he can survive.

295
00:45:59,368 --> 00:46:01,768
Osman needs a wet nurse.

296
00:46:07,528 --> 00:46:11,088
God willing, Osman will grow up
to be strong, Son.

297
00:46:16,408 --> 00:46:18,328
That child belongs to God.

298
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:23,128
God is the sole hope of the hopeless,

299
00:46:24,168 --> 00:46:25,848
and the curer of the sick.

300
00:46:27,048 --> 00:46:29,048
Hope of the lonely.

301
00:46:30,528 --> 00:46:32,248
He does not abandon

302
00:46:33,048 --> 00:46:36,488
those who seek refuge in him.

303
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:40,448
He always welcomes.

304
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:44,328
He awards those who show patience.

305
00:46:47,128 --> 00:46:49,648
Now, go on your way.

306
00:46:51,048 --> 00:46:53,408
Those who advance shall win.

307
00:46:54,408 --> 00:46:56,888
Those who advance shall find peace.

308
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:01,288
Those who advance shall be legends.

309
00:47:02,728 --> 00:47:05,408
Know that God's mercy has no limits.

310
00:47:06,808 --> 00:47:10,288
Osman will hopefully have a bright future.

311
00:47:36,408 --> 00:47:37,448
God willing.

312
00:47:38,368 --> 00:47:40,928
Godspeed, Son.

313
00:47:43,008 --> 00:47:44,088
Amen.

314
00:48:35,648 --> 00:48:39,328
My brave brother, our mother is gone.

315
00:48:40,448 --> 00:48:43,168
But we shall see her again.

316
00:48:43,848 --> 00:48:46,088
She sees and watches us.

317
00:48:46,688 --> 00:48:49,848
She'll be glad if we're strong.

318
00:48:55,448 --> 00:48:56,648
Oh, God...

319
00:48:58,528 --> 00:48:59,968
Please help us.

320
00:49:00,888 --> 00:49:03,768
Our father is a brave bey

321
00:49:04,128 --> 00:49:07,048
and we'll be children worthy of him.

322
00:49:07,888 --> 00:49:11,688
We'll be beys worthy
of our mothers and fathers.

323
00:49:15,848 --> 00:49:18,528
Now, we must stay strong.

324
00:49:20,528 --> 00:49:24,208
Don't fear, I'll always be with you.

325
00:49:59,368 --> 00:50:00,608
Mother Hayme...

326
00:50:01,808 --> 00:50:03,888
What will happen to Osman?

327
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,568
How will he live without milk?

328
00:50:07,048 --> 00:50:09,048
There are no wet nurses in the village.

329
00:50:14,568 --> 00:50:16,288
I await news from the alps.

330
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:20,008
God is great.

331
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:24,648
A wet nurse for Osman will be found.

332
00:50:27,088 --> 00:50:31,288
God won't abandon this innocent baby.

333
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:34,968
God willing.

334
00:50:37,048 --> 00:50:39,288
God willing, we'll receive good news.

335
00:50:40,888 --> 00:50:42,048
God willing, dear.

336
00:50:42,568 --> 00:50:44,288
Has Ertuğrul Bey come back?

337
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,968
Not yet, Mother Hayme.

338
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:49,128
All right.

339
00:50:53,608 --> 00:50:54,968
Oh, sweet child.

340
00:51:00,408 --> 00:51:01,928
Oh, God.

341
00:51:03,008 --> 00:51:04,728
Help us.

342
00:51:06,288 --> 00:51:07,928
Help us, God.

343
00:51:53,128 --> 00:51:54,968
You're cold.

344
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,568
Your eyes are lifeless.

345
00:52:11,288 --> 00:52:14,088
How can your mother live
with this pain, Son?

346
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:18,128
I wish I was buried.

347
00:53:19,048 --> 00:53:22,408
I wish my death would give you life!

348
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:26,488
Take it.

349
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:33,728
The glorious state should be your cradle,
but instead it became your grave.

350
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:46,248
Halime.

351
00:53:47,768 --> 00:53:48,768
My Halime.

352
00:54:00,568 --> 00:54:01,888
Aktolgali...

353
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:07,848
My sword is hopeless,
my heart is aflame.

354
00:54:11,408 --> 00:54:13,768
I know you can't disobey fate.

355
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,368
God help me...

356
00:54:20,328 --> 00:54:21,328
for my children...

357
00:54:23,048 --> 00:54:25,528
for my village and give me strength.

358
00:54:28,448 --> 00:54:29,528
God...

359
00:54:31,608 --> 00:54:33,688
Give strength to my orphans...

360
00:54:36,288 --> 00:54:38,768
and to Osman who is hungry.

361
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:44,008
<i>I stand strong and proud, Ertuğrul.</i>

362
00:54:45,488 --> 00:54:47,368
May my tears accompany you.

363
00:54:49,448 --> 00:54:51,488
May my love shield you.

364
00:54:55,928 --> 00:54:57,288
May the blue sky

365
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,928
and the ground be your friends.

366
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:05,448
If you listen to strong winds,

367
00:55:06,248 --> 00:55:07,728
you'll hear me.

368
00:55:08,368 --> 00:55:10,568
The rain will bring my love to you.

369
00:55:16,568 --> 00:55:19,608
<i>May God look after you, Ertuğrul.</i>

370
00:55:19,968 --> 00:55:22,288
<i>I know that he'll protect you.</i>

371
00:55:25,128 --> 00:55:26,128
My Halime.

372
00:55:27,928 --> 00:55:28,928
Oh, God...

373
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:33,328
God, give us strength.

374
00:55:37,688 --> 00:55:40,848
Help us so my Osman doesn't stay hungry.

375
00:55:44,768 --> 00:55:47,288
Help him survive.

376
00:55:53,448 --> 00:55:55,608
Even in mourning we fight, Aktolgali.

377
00:55:58,968 --> 00:56:00,808
My children wait for me.

378
00:56:02,928 --> 00:56:04,768
My crying mother looks for me.

379
00:56:10,688 --> 00:56:12,768
While Osman sleeps hungrily,

380
00:56:13,688 --> 00:56:17,248
I can't mourn or worry, Aktolgali.

381
00:56:45,728 --> 00:56:46,728
Aktolgali!

382
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,008
Aktolgali!

383
00:57:31,808 --> 00:57:32,928
Oh, God...

384
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:37,488
God, give me strength.

385
00:57:43,568 --> 00:57:44,808
Or take my life.

386
00:57:46,448 --> 00:57:47,728
End my suffering.

387
00:58:55,968 --> 00:58:57,408
Aktolgali!

388
00:59:25,568 --> 00:59:26,608
I can't.

389
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:28,648
I can't you give my son.

390
00:59:29,728 --> 00:59:32,088
He died before I could feed him.

391
00:59:33,648 --> 00:59:37,128
I won't give him to you or to the ground.

392
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:40,128
I share your pain.

393
00:59:41,168 --> 00:59:43,528
In this mountain, I share your pain.

394
00:59:46,248 --> 00:59:49,768
I'm not an enemy, but a brother.

395
00:59:52,848 --> 00:59:54,848
My son belongs in the ground.

396
00:59:56,408 --> 00:59:57,688
I can't give him away.

397
01:00:00,488 --> 01:00:02,128
It's a dark day for us.

398
01:00:04,728 --> 01:00:06,768
I just buried my wife.

399
01:00:13,288 --> 01:00:14,928
My three children are orphans.

400
01:00:16,688 --> 01:00:17,688
My Osman...

401
01:00:19,688 --> 01:00:21,288
doesn't stop crying.

402
01:00:23,688 --> 01:00:26,408
My hands still smell like earth.

403
01:00:29,648 --> 01:00:31,448
You lost your child.

404
01:00:34,688 --> 01:00:35,968
I saw your pain.

405
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,408
I felt your pain.

406
01:00:41,968 --> 01:00:44,208
Let me help you on this dark day.

407
01:00:46,488 --> 01:00:50,608
Let me pray for your son.

408
01:01:06,928 --> 01:01:08,208
Sorry for your loss.

409
01:01:10,808 --> 01:01:12,528
You're in pain too.

410
01:01:17,968 --> 01:01:21,808
I don't know how to live with this pain.

411
01:01:23,608 --> 01:01:27,848
You'll do your duty first, and then mourn.

412
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:33,368
If you can't bury him,

413
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:36,368
let me do it for you.

414
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,208
Let's pray for his soul.

415
01:02:01,088 --> 01:02:03,008
He was just a baby.

416
01:02:04,328 --> 01:02:06,248
Born in the joy of the spring.

417
01:02:07,608 --> 01:02:10,768
Died with the summer, my son.

418
01:02:14,968 --> 01:02:16,248
I'll always miss him.

419
01:02:18,328 --> 01:02:20,048
He belongs in the ground now.

420
01:02:49,488 --> 01:02:51,008
Oh, my dear.

421
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:54,248
Mother Hayme, I did all I could.

422
01:02:54,528 --> 01:02:57,168
But my milk isn't enough for him.

423
01:02:59,528 --> 01:03:00,968
My baby is still young too.

424
01:03:01,328 --> 01:03:03,088
I have to feed him as well.

425
01:03:05,488 --> 01:03:08,368
We need another woman.

426
01:03:09,608 --> 01:03:12,248
We will surely find one, dear.

427
01:03:13,848 --> 01:03:16,808
God will always present an opportunity.

428
01:03:23,848 --> 01:03:25,368
God bless you.

429
01:03:26,688 --> 01:03:28,128
You fed our Osman.

430
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:30,848
You gave us hope.

431
01:03:31,528 --> 01:03:33,888
Don't mention it, Mother Hayme.

432
01:03:43,048 --> 01:03:46,128
God, help us.

433
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:48,688
Help us.

434
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:53,168
Oh! Oh, my sweet boy.

435
01:03:53,728 --> 01:03:55,128
Oh, my baby.

436
01:04:53,928 --> 01:04:56,248
Now, bring me Ertuğrul.

437
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:24,810
My brave horse.

438
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:29,490
My friend on this dark day.

439
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,050
You're more than a brother to me.

440
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:43,730
You brought hope to Osman
in my darkest hour.

441
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:15,530
The water that rushes out of the rocks.

442
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:20,810
The water that moves...

443
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:23,410
the ships.

444
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:27,850
The water that gives life...

445
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:30,850
to vineyards and gardens.

446
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:35,690
The water drunk by...

447
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:38,930
beautiful horses, red camels...

448
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,450
white sheep...

449
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:44,370
and around which they rest.

450
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:51,610
Do you know my son?

451
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,530
Oh, dear water.

452
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:17,610
May God keep our faith pure
when death comes.

453
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:20,450
May He accept...

454
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:25,330
this innocent one into Heaven
in the name of Muhammad Mustafa.

455
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,130
Amen.

456
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,530
Have you got anybody?

457
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:38,210
Then let me take you to my village.

458
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:42,490
You go to your village.

459
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:47,050
You're burdened enough...

460
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,850
let me be with my pain.

461
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:53,490
Go to your children.

462
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,850
And I'll go to mine.

463
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,370
I can't leave you alone here.

464
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:04,050
It will be dangerous.

465
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:09,930
How can I leave my child alone here,
my bey?

466
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:17,530
How can I leave my son to the cold
and the darkness of the night?

467
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:21,610
I won't leave until my last breath.

468
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:23,530
Stop.

469
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:26,930
Do you want to die on his grave?

470
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:30,210
If so,

471
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:33,410
this is disobedience against God.

472
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:35,850
<i>Hyah!</i>

473
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:37,930
Hyah!

474
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:43,570
They won't have my son.

475
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:46,050
Go away, my bey. Ride away.

476
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,170
Don't get involved with this scum.

477
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:49,770
Who are they?

478
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:17,410
Ho!

479
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:52,930
Come on.

480
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:22,770
So, you couldn't leave your wife.

481
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:26,090
Don't worry.

482
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:28,930
I'll send you to her soon.

483
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,410
-Turgut Bey.
-<i>Selamun aleykum.</i>

484
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,490
<i>Aleykum selam.</i>

485
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:07,770
Any news, Ahmet?

486
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:09,730
No good news, Turgut Bey.

487
01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:12,730
Governor Kritos prepares to attack.

488
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,330
Attack? Where?

489
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,610
In some tannery.

490
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:22,690
Almıla Hatun and her men.

491
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:26,490
Ertuğrul Bey is mourning,
he's using it.

492
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,250
Scum.

493
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,290
You're right, Günalp Bey.

494
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,450
He'll hit him when he's weak.

495
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,450
Where is my bey?

496
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:37,770
He went to the mountains to be alone.

497
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:41,090
Maybe he's returned.

498
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:43,650
Then let's go to the village.

499
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:44,930
No.

500
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:46,850
No time to go there.

501
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,330
They could attack any time.

502
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:52,250
We have to go to the tannery
at once.

503
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:53,330
And Ertuğrul Bey?

504
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:57,410
While you go to the tannery,
send an alp to Ertuğrul Bey.

505
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:59,570
I'll go get my men from the castle.

506
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:00,930
Let's go at once.

507
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:04,210
All right, Günalp Bey. You're right.

508
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:08,530
Let my bey mourn.

509
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:15,370
We'll take care of this
without disappointing him.

510
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:18,890
-Of course.
-Then, I'll meet you at the fight.

511
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:21,250
May God help us all.

512
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:22,810
-Amen.
-Amen.

513
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,610
-Let's go finish them.
-Come on.

514
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,530
Oğuz,

515
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:41,250
go to the village
and let Ertuğrul Bey know.

516
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:45,010
Tell him the governor is attacking
the tannery.

517
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:47,650
We'll go there quickly.

518
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:50,250
As you command.

519
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,490
Come on, brothers.

520
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:09,490
Hyah!

521
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,850
Come on!

522
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:29,890
The bird of prey waits eagerly.

523
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:32,570
Come on, brave boy.

524
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:43,210
Sugay Hatun.

525
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:46,010
You buried my bey's grandson.

526
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:47,890
You'll pay for this.

527
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:49,930
Take the woman.

528
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:52,010
Our bey will make you pay.

529
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:53,850
The woman is in pain.

530
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,290
I don't know you.

531
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:01,410
But I won't let you take her away.

532
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:03,330
Who are you?

533
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:05,450
Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

534
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:16,690
You can't stop us just because
you're the margrave.

535
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:18,850
This is bigger than you.

536
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,410
Go away, my bey.

537
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:27,730
Then come and take Sugay Hatun.

538
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:31,730
Who are you? Step aside.

539
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:33,490
Think.

540
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,250
You will remember.

541
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,810
<i>Who is this?</i>

542
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,370
<i>A traveler.</i>

543
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:52,410
<i>You'll know him soon.</i>

544
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:54,210
You,

545
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:57,170
the strange man with Governor Kritos.

546
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:58,330
What do you want?

547
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:01,210
Your life.

548
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:04,130
What does that mean?

549
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,930
Old Governor Ares.

550
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:11,370
Now called Ahmet Alp.

551
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:16,370
Everybody knows what you are,

552
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:21,450
how you're spying for Ertuğrul.

553
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:23,570
So does Kritos.

554
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:25,570
What are you saying, you fool?

555
01:16:25,970 --> 01:16:27,730
Step aside before I crush you!

556
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,850
Why are you denying, Ahmet Alp?

557
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:34,850
We know you told Ertuğrul
about the attack.

558
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:39,770
You won't spy for Ertuğrul anymore.

559
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:43,090
Because Ertuğrul will die.

560
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:46,930
And I, Noyan, shall kill you.

561
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:48,850
You are...

562
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,210
Ögeday's commander Noyan.

563
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:57,170
You worked with Kritos
to attack Ertuğrul.

564
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:59,290
I'll crush you.

565
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,850
I won't let them be ambushed.

566
01:17:15,450 --> 01:17:16,930
Come on, brave boy.

567
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:21,090
Show your loyalty to Ertuğrul Bey.

568
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:55,090
The vultures and the crows are impatient.

569
01:17:56,290 --> 01:17:58,610
They wish to feed on a corpse.

570
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:01,290
Your corpse.

571
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:05,490
Even if I die, I'll be a martyr
for my cause.

572
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,250
Good, then.

573
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:14,210
You should be grateful,
since I'll help you get there.

574
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:18,250
Let the vultures and the crows wait.

575
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,810
Now's the time for the hunter.

576
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,170
The hunters fly above their prey.

577
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:29,090
As they fly, death approaches.

578
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:08,490
Gök Tengri's black bird...

579
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:11,690
The right wing blocks the sun,

580
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:16,530
the left wing blocks the moon.

581
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:22,370
I wield the soul of that black bird.

582
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:28,130
I heard death.

583
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,610
The flapping of the black wings of death.

584
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,210
When the black bird descends,

585
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:45,250
no man can run away.

586
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:51,010
You won't run away from me.

587
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:57,330
Noyan's sword will bring you death.

588
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:14,210
<i>There is only one God...</i>

589
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:17,130
<i>and Muhammad...</i>

590
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,210
<i>is his servant...</i>

591
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:21,410
<i>and his messenger.</i>

592
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:34,090
Incoming.

593
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:35,610
The guards are signaling.

594
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:41,570
Must be Ertuğrul.

595
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:45,170
The time has come.
Get ready.

596
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:47,250
Don't mess it up.

597
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,130
Everyone, back to work.

598
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,410
Where is Ertuğrul?

599
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:28,610
He'll come, be patient.

600
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:46,370
Chief Alp Bamsi, Turgut Bey.

601
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:48,410
Welcome.

602
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:50,450
Thanks, Almıla Hatun.

603
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:53,530
Thank you.
Thank you, Almıla Hatun.

604
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:56,650
You honor our tannery. Please.

605
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:02,530
Nice tannery. You're doing good work,
but we have bad news.

606
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:07,930
What are you saying?

607
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:09,290
Governor Kritos.

608
01:24:09,650 --> 01:24:13,130
He will attack to prevent the artisans
invited by Ertuğrul Bey

609
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:14,610
from coming here.

610
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:20,130
The infidel can go to hell!

611
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:21,930
We're not afraid.

612
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:26,650
I'll fight along my brothers.

613
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:32,890
We don't doubt your bravery,
but you have no choice.

614
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:36,410
They'll attack before sunset.

615
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:39,970
Then they'll disappear in the dark.

616
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:46,250
And Ertuğrul Bey?

617
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:50,690
He isn't aware.

618
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:58,050
We will take care of this.

619
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,610
Where is your frontier bey?

620
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:09,130
His wife passed away. He's mourning.

621
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:12,330
So I heard.

622
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:14,170
I'm sorry.

623
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:18,570
Now, you'll go away.

624
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:25,250
We'll ambush them with our men.

625
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:30,810
Almıla,

626
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:33,250
we can't just leave here.

627
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:43,090
Eynece, Turgut Bey is right.

628
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:47,570
We'll do as he says.

629
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:58,210
All right, then.

630
01:26:19,930 --> 01:26:21,170
Now, tell me.

631
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:23,730
Who are you?

632
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:27,010
A shepherd's wife.

633
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:30,090
He herded the Greek's animals.

634
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:33,730
He was killed in the Amid campaign.

635
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:37,130
I don't have anybody, Ertuğrul Bey,

636
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:42,090
except my little boy who died.

637
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:45,170
Who were these men?

638
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:49,330
My husband's relatives.

639
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:52,170
When he died,

640
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:55,690
they wanted me to marry his brother.

641
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:58,650
I didn't want to. I ran away.

642
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:00,690
I became a shepherd.

643
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:03,570
I herded the Greeks' goats.

644
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:08,210
My son was born on Nowruz.

645
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:12,650
I would raise him.

646
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:14,170
But...

647
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:17,650
he had a fever.

648
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,490
In the morning, he closed his eyes.

649
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:24,770
And he never...

650
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:27,770
If they found you today,

651
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,370
they'll do so tomorrow.

652
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,290
I don't care.

653
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:35,690
What is your tribe?

654
01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:37,610
Tell me.

655
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:41,490
So that I can help end this.

656
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:45,970
I'm not from here.

657
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:49,130
My tribe is the Khwarazmians.

658
01:27:50,570 --> 01:27:51,930
I came from far away.

659
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:57,250
Look.

660
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:00,530
My son needs a wet nurse.

661
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:03,930
Come to my village.

662
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:06,290
Be my son's wet nurse.

663
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:08,850
Join us.

664
01:28:12,970 --> 01:28:14,490
You can come here later,

665
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:16,370
whenever you wish,

666
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:18,010
to pray for him.

667
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:25,770
Maybe feeding my son will ease the pain
of your son's passing.

668
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:47,530
Come on.

669
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:51,050
Don't torture yourself.

670
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:53,450
Pull yourself together.

671
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:54,730
Huh?

672
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:57,770
How can I forget about my mother?

673
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:59,650
I'm patient.

674
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:02,530
But my heart aches, Grandmother.

675
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:06,090
What will we do with my brothers?

676
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,410
From now on,

677
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:16,290
I'll be your grandmother
and your mother.

678
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:19,690
I'll treat you equally.

679
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,610
Don't forget.

680
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:28,490
It would anger God to be so sad
before death.

681
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:36,290
He gives life and takes it away.

682
01:29:38,890 --> 01:29:39,890
Also,

683
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:43,730
your father will always be with you.

684
01:29:44,530 --> 01:29:45,650
-Grandmother.
-Yes?

685
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:49,530
My father doesn't show it,
but he's sad too.

686
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:51,650
Rest assured, son.

687
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:55,490
Ertuğrul will mourn...

688
01:29:56,970 --> 01:30:01,090
and then he'll come back to his village
and to his family.

689
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:19,650
-Grandmother, Osman is hungry.
-Huh?

690
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:22,050
He needs milk.

691
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:24,730
Look, he's crying.

692
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:29,730
We will find some.

693
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:31,730
Keep praying.

694
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:39,290
God won't refuse prayers
made in times of pain.

695
01:30:44,130 --> 01:30:46,050
He will surely show mercy.

696
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:47,890
I hope so, Grandmother.

697
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,010
Hold on, Osman.

698
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:55,810
My brave son.

699
01:30:57,290 --> 01:30:58,650
Hold on.

700
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:01,770
You shall be fed, God willing.

701
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:06,610
Oh, God,

702
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:09,210
help us.

703
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:16,850
Show mercy to this child of yours,
oh, God.

704
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:04,650
<i>Permission to enter, Artuk Bey?</i>

705
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:06,490
Come in, Oğuz Alp.

706
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:13,130
What's the matter?

707
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:16,290
My bey, Ahmet Alp brought news
from the governor.

708
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:18,650
He will attack the tanners.

709
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:21,570
Attack?

710
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:25,490
Turgut Bey, Günalp Bey and Chief Alp Bamsi
are stationed there.

711
01:32:26,090 --> 01:32:27,290
And Ertuğrul Bey?

712
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:30,410
I'm here to let him know, my bey.

713
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:31,890
But he isn't here.

714
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:35,850
Ertuğrul Bey will surely come.

715
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:38,010
The duty falls on us now.

716
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:41,050
Get reinforcements and go there.

717
01:32:41,850 --> 01:32:44,330
I'll let Ertuğrul Bey know when he comes.

718
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:46,650
As you order.

719
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:48,290
Be safe.

720
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,170
The milk I couldn't give you...

721
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:06,170
will give life to Ertuğrul Bey's son,
Osman.

722
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:10,490
I'll always come to visit you.

723
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:16,290
I'll water the grave and pray
for your soul.

724
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:29,770
Let's not keep Osman waiting.

725
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:36,050
The spirits want you dead, Ertuğrul.

726
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:39,610
Gök Tengri wants your meat.

727
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:51,290
Erlik Khan wants your soul.

728
01:35:53,050 --> 01:35:56,290
The great mountains and mysterious rivers
want your blood.

729
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:14,930
Your rotten flesh will feed
the maggots...

730
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:22,330
and your corpse, the trees.

731
01:36:55,170 --> 01:36:56,170
Speak.

732
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:01,050
Is Ertuğrul coming?

733
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:03,650
No, brother.

734
01:37:18,330 --> 01:37:19,330
Why?

735
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:22,290
Turgut and Bamsi came.

736
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,970
They said Ertuğrul was mourning
over Halime.

737
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:28,930
They don't know where.

738
01:37:32,650 --> 01:37:34,690
We can postpone the attack.

739
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:36,810
Ahmet is dead.

740
01:37:37,330 --> 01:37:38,330
It's too late.

741
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:44,250
What good is the attack
if Ertuğrul doesn't die?

742
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:47,370
Ertuğrul will be worse than dead.

743
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:09,330
You'll attack the tannery with your men.

744
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:11,890
Surround them, let no one escape.

745
01:38:12,290 --> 01:38:13,690
As you wish, sir.

746
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:15,450
You, take the remaining men
and come with me.

747
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:18,490
We'll attack Ertuğrul's men.
I want no mistakes.

748
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:20,890
-They will all die, understood?
-Yes, sir.

749
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:22,210
Go on.

750
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:44,890
Ambush!

751
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:48,450
For God!

752
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:49,730
We'll attack when we see
the governor and his men.

753
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:54,450
It's an ambush, my bey.

754
01:39:58,250 --> 01:39:59,170
Hide!

755
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:01,450
What's happening?

756
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:11,410
Go on, men!

757
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:47,250
For God!

758
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:18,490
-Are you okay?
-Yes, Turgut Bey.

759
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:20,170
Is everyone okay?

760
01:42:32,930 --> 01:42:33,970
Where is Ertuğrul?

761
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:38,850
Was he too scared to come when Ares,

762
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:41,810
or should I say Ahmet Alp,
brought the news?

763
01:42:42,810 --> 01:42:43,810
Ahmet Alp...

764
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:46,730
Yes, Ahmet Alp,

765
01:42:47,290 --> 01:42:48,290
Ahmet Alp.

766
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:53,850
That traitor, Ertuğrul's spy,
lies dead on the road.

767
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:55,930
The carrion will have your corpse.

768
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:57,650
Scum!

769
01:42:58,410 --> 01:43:01,490
Do you think I'll go down without a fight?

770
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:03,650
Huh?

771
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:16,170
-What is this?
-We're here, Günalp Bey!

772
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:20,530
Ambush! We're ambushed!

773
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:21,730
Attack!

774
01:44:30,570 --> 01:44:31,650
{\an8}That scum is running away.

775
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:34,530
{\an8}We'll make him pay. Go to the tannery.

776
01:44:48,373 --> 01:44:50,213
Oh, my dear.

777
01:44:51,093 --> 01:44:53,133
God, I beg you.

778
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:55,773
You give us bread.

779
01:44:57,213 --> 01:44:59,573
You don't abandon your servants.

780
01:45:06,253 --> 01:45:11,493
God, please show us your mercy
so that my baby Osman can be fed.

781
01:45:13,093 --> 01:45:15,013
Oh, my dear boy.

782
01:45:20,373 --> 01:45:21,453
Ah, my son.

783
01:45:22,053 --> 01:45:23,053
Son.

784
01:45:25,613 --> 01:45:26,693
How is Osman?

785
01:45:27,213 --> 01:45:29,053
He wants to be fed.

786
01:45:30,293 --> 01:45:32,413
Look how he's crying.

787
01:45:49,813 --> 01:45:50,813
Sugay Hatun.

788
01:45:55,613 --> 01:45:58,053
God willing, she'll feed Osman, mother.

789
01:46:04,373 --> 01:46:05,373
Oh, God...

790
01:46:06,733 --> 01:46:08,013
praise your name.

791
01:46:10,333 --> 01:46:11,613
Welcome, dear.

792
01:46:12,133 --> 01:46:13,133
Thank you.

793
01:46:15,453 --> 01:46:17,373
Sugay Hatun lost her baby, Mother.

794
01:46:25,253 --> 01:46:27,293
God helped and made us meet.

795
01:46:28,493 --> 01:46:31,333
God willing,
Sugay Hatun will greatly help us...

796
01:46:33,773 --> 01:46:35,813
and end Osman's hunger.

797
01:46:36,773 --> 01:46:37,773
God willing.

798
01:46:38,733 --> 01:46:40,293
Sorry for your loss, dear.

799
01:46:41,533 --> 01:46:43,173
May God dull your pain.

800
01:47:02,013 --> 01:47:03,173
Hush.

801
01:48:03,493 --> 01:48:05,013
Oh, God Almighty,

802
01:48:05,773 --> 01:48:07,333
how beautiful you are.

803
01:48:10,013 --> 01:48:11,133
Mashallah to you.

804
01:48:12,373 --> 01:48:13,533
You smell like heaven,

805
01:48:14,413 --> 01:48:15,413
beautiful face.

806
01:48:25,933 --> 01:48:28,613
What a sweet baby you are.

807
01:48:34,773 --> 01:48:37,653
I saw the gardens of Heaven in your eyes.

808
01:48:38,653 --> 01:48:41,533
As if they were taking me there.

809
01:48:50,293 --> 01:48:51,413
Oh God...

810
01:48:52,813 --> 01:48:54,173
praise your name.

811
01:48:56,893 --> 01:48:58,573
You took my child.

812
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:00,333
But...

813
01:49:01,613 --> 01:49:05,573
granted me another baby
whom I can call my child.

814
01:49:13,453 --> 01:49:15,413
Your power can't be doubted.

815
01:49:16,893 --> 01:49:18,773
I can't praise you enough.

816
01:49:27,253 --> 01:49:28,253
Ertuğrul Bey.

817
01:49:30,533 --> 01:49:33,053
You helped me out of a great trouble.

818
01:49:35,453 --> 01:49:38,813
Being the wet nurse of this sweet baby
is an honor.

819
01:49:41,253 --> 01:49:42,413
Thank you, Sugay Hatun.

820
01:49:50,053 --> 01:49:52,533
Then, let's get inside.

821
01:49:54,413 --> 01:49:56,573
Feed Osman at once.

822
01:50:07,293 --> 01:50:08,293
Come, dear.

823
01:50:29,253 --> 01:50:30,253
My baby.

824
01:50:31,253 --> 01:50:32,413
Are you hungry?

825
01:50:34,333 --> 01:50:35,453
Be patient.

826
01:50:36,093 --> 01:50:37,453
I'll feed you now.

827
01:51:20,213 --> 01:51:21,573
Where is Ahmet Alp?

828
01:51:23,693 --> 01:51:24,933
I didn't see him.

829
01:51:27,933 --> 01:51:30,213
Maybe he's where Günalp Bey was ambushed.

830
01:51:43,373 --> 01:51:44,453
Günalp Bey?

831
01:51:44,773 --> 01:51:47,053
Did you finish off the infidels?

832
01:51:53,173 --> 01:51:54,173
Günalp Bey...

833
01:51:55,893 --> 01:51:56,893
tell me.

834
01:51:58,013 --> 01:52:00,133
Or did the infidel prevail?

835
01:52:00,333 --> 01:52:01,333
No,

836
01:52:01,893 --> 01:52:03,133
they could not.

837
01:52:03,733 --> 01:52:05,133
We beat the scum.

838
01:52:09,773 --> 01:52:11,933
But I lost all my men.

839
01:52:17,493 --> 01:52:18,493
For our State...

840
01:52:20,733 --> 01:52:21,813
and country.

841
01:52:22,053 --> 01:52:23,333
-Indeed.
-Amen.

842
01:52:26,053 --> 01:52:27,053
Only I survived.

843
01:52:27,853 --> 01:52:29,533
Almıla Hatun and his men came.

844
01:52:31,173 --> 01:52:32,533
The Governor ran away.

845
01:52:33,173 --> 01:52:35,093
Almıla Hatun's men chased him.

846
01:52:35,413 --> 01:52:36,413
Brave woman.

847
01:52:37,653 --> 01:52:38,973
Any news from Ahmet?

848
01:52:41,253 --> 01:52:43,173
Governor Kritos said he killed him.

849
01:52:43,653 --> 01:52:45,373
Killed him? How?

850
01:52:48,373 --> 01:52:50,933
How? Why, Günalp Bey?

851
01:52:51,453 --> 01:52:53,213
He learned his name was Ahmet Alp.

852
01:52:54,133 --> 01:52:55,853
He learned he was a spy.

853
01:53:00,733 --> 01:53:02,533
We must find him at once.

854
01:53:04,173 --> 01:53:06,173
The Governor said he left him on the road.

855
01:53:07,093 --> 01:53:08,493
Let's go then.

856
01:53:08,693 --> 01:53:09,693
Quickly.

857
01:53:10,253 --> 01:53:11,973
-Come on.
-Let's go.

858
01:53:35,733 --> 01:53:37,693
You treacherous woman.

859
01:54:27,213 --> 01:54:28,213
Noyan.

860
01:54:32,573 --> 01:54:33,573
Noyan?

861
01:54:33,853 --> 01:54:35,413
This one's head is yours.

862
01:54:36,053 --> 01:54:37,293
You...

863
01:54:41,133 --> 01:54:42,653
It's yours, Alangoya.

864
01:54:44,453 --> 01:54:45,773
You scum.

865
01:54:47,093 --> 01:54:48,173
Mongol scum.

866
01:54:48,453 --> 01:54:49,613
You tricked me.

867
01:55:26,413 --> 01:55:29,213
The merciful man inside me is awake,
Alangoya.

868
01:55:34,693 --> 01:55:38,693
I won't let Ertuğrul's three sons grow up
as orphans.

869
01:55:41,733 --> 01:55:42,733
Gündüz,

870
01:55:43,333 --> 01:55:44,333
Savcı,

871
01:55:45,053 --> 01:55:46,053
Osman...

872
01:55:47,373 --> 01:55:49,253
These three orphans...

873
01:55:50,533 --> 01:55:52,213
need a mother like you.

874
01:55:56,213 --> 01:55:58,053
You'll seduce Ertuğrul,

875
01:55:59,213 --> 01:56:03,173
you'll make the bravest Turkish Bey
your plaything.

876
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:08,493
With your beauty,

877
01:56:09,533 --> 01:56:11,453
and the help of the spirits,

878
01:56:12,293 --> 01:56:14,533
Ertuğrul will fall in love with you.

879
01:56:18,133 --> 01:56:20,733
When you bring him the Governor's head,

880
01:56:21,253 --> 01:56:24,093
you'll conquer his heart.

881
01:56:28,973 --> 01:56:30,613
Ertuğrul's bed is my bed,

882
01:56:31,493 --> 01:56:32,893
his children mine,

883
01:56:33,893 --> 01:56:35,373
when the time comes,

884
01:56:35,533 --> 01:56:38,453
their fathers' skin will cover our tent.
And his children's blood...

885
01:56:42,653 --> 01:56:44,533
will cover our swords.

886
01:57:35,613 --> 01:57:38,493
Since a brave man's bed is never empty...

887
01:57:40,213 --> 01:57:45,173
Ertuğrul's bed is worthy
of a woman like you.

888
01:57:47,813 --> 01:57:48,813
Don't forget,

889
01:57:49,733 --> 01:57:51,333
you don't look...

890
01:57:52,413 --> 01:57:54,493
a gift horse in the mouth.

891
01:58:16,493 --> 01:58:18,053
<i>Permission to enter, my Bey?</i>

892
01:58:19,693 --> 01:58:20,733
Come in, Artuk Bey.

893
01:58:31,253 --> 01:58:32,253
Welcome, my Bey.

894
01:58:32,613 --> 01:58:33,693
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

895
01:58:34,533 --> 01:58:35,533
Any news?

896
01:58:35,773 --> 01:58:38,253
Ahmet Alp brought news from the Governor.

897
01:58:38,493 --> 01:58:42,293
Governor Kritos will attack
Almıla Hatun's tannery.

898
01:58:43,173 --> 01:58:44,733
Attack the tannery?

899
01:58:45,773 --> 01:58:48,293
How can that scum dare to do such a thing?

900
01:58:48,493 --> 01:58:51,453
My Bey,
since you're mourning Halime Hatun,

901
01:58:51,693 --> 01:58:54,093
-he wanted to use--
-Scum!

902
01:58:57,493 --> 01:58:58,893
Did you take precautions?

903
01:58:59,173 --> 01:59:00,893
Did Turgut, Bamsı and Günalp go?

904
01:59:01,053 --> 01:59:02,173
They're all there.

905
01:59:02,333 --> 01:59:05,013
They sent Oğuz Alp here to let you know.

906
01:59:05,453 --> 01:59:06,773
But you weren't here.

907
01:59:09,293 --> 01:59:12,093
I brought a woman to feed Osman,
Artuk Bey.

908
01:59:14,173 --> 01:59:15,213
Where is she?

909
01:59:16,933 --> 01:59:17,933
Inside, feeding.

910
01:59:19,613 --> 01:59:21,253
I hope Osman will be okay.

911
01:59:22,133 --> 01:59:23,973
God willing, my Bey.

912
01:59:24,893 --> 01:59:27,653
Turgut Bey, Günalp Bey and Chief Alp Bamsı

913
01:59:28,133 --> 01:59:31,533
will take care of that dog of a Governor,
have no fear.

914
01:59:33,173 --> 01:59:34,173
Thanks, Artuk Bey.

915
01:59:35,293 --> 01:59:36,293
Thanks.

916
01:59:40,173 --> 01:59:44,173
<i>My lucky land</i>

917
01:59:46,533 --> 01:59:52,653
<i>May your black mountains stand high</i>

918
01:59:55,213 --> 02:00:01,413
<i>May your trees not be cut down</i>

919
02:00:03,933 --> 02:00:10,853
<i>May your water never cease to flow</i>

920
02:00:13,133 --> 02:00:19,853
<i>May fate never make you beg</i>
<i>To a dishonest man</i>

921
02:00:22,973 --> 02:00:28,933
<i>May your white steed run free</i>

922
02:00:33,453 --> 02:00:34,973
My dear baby.

923
02:00:37,293 --> 02:00:39,613
God willing, you'll always be at peace.

924
02:00:45,973 --> 02:00:47,813
God bless you, dear.

925
02:00:49,013 --> 02:00:50,693
You did us a great favor.

926
02:00:53,133 --> 02:00:55,133
My Osman lost his mother.

927
02:00:57,093 --> 02:01:00,573
But found warmth in you.

928
02:01:01,653 --> 02:01:04,933
It's no coincidence that he likes you.

929
02:01:08,693 --> 02:01:10,133
God sent you.

930
02:01:12,253 --> 02:01:18,093
I see that you found your lost baby
in our Osman.

931
02:01:27,653 --> 02:01:31,653
I still feel the pain I felt for my son.

932
02:01:33,973 --> 02:01:36,173
But, as you said...

933
02:01:37,253 --> 02:01:38,253
Osman...

934
02:01:39,573 --> 02:01:42,093
dulled the pain I feel in my heart.

935
02:01:45,293 --> 02:01:48,053
Thanks to God, I ran into Ertuğrul Bey.

936
02:01:52,533 --> 02:01:53,733
You're right.

937
02:01:55,613 --> 02:01:58,533
There's no questioning his mercy.

938
02:02:00,133 --> 02:02:02,933
Whatever he does, he is benevolent.

939
02:02:04,893 --> 02:02:06,973
God willing, Osman will be healthy.

940
02:02:07,893 --> 02:02:09,613
I'll raise him as if he's mine.

941
02:02:10,013 --> 02:02:11,013
Hopefully.

942
02:02:16,933 --> 02:02:18,333
<i>Permission to enter?</i>

943
02:02:18,933 --> 02:02:20,493
Come, son.

944
02:02:53,053 --> 02:02:54,893
God bless you, Sugay Hatun.

945
02:02:57,533 --> 02:02:58,733
You gave hope to Osman.

946
02:03:01,693 --> 02:03:03,493
We can't ever repay you for that.

947
02:03:06,893 --> 02:03:08,333
Thanks to you,

948
02:03:09,493 --> 02:03:10,693
he's alive.

949
02:03:12,973 --> 02:03:14,773
God bless you.

950
02:03:16,853 --> 02:03:20,613
You raised me up
and saved me from those men.

951
02:03:24,213 --> 02:03:25,733
God wanted this to happen.

952
02:03:27,453 --> 02:03:29,813
I only did the necessary, Sugay Hatun.

953
02:03:31,573 --> 02:03:37,373
I only wanted to forget
about my pain and suffering.

954
02:03:42,373 --> 02:03:44,013
Osman gave me hope too.

955
02:03:45,213 --> 02:03:46,373
He lit up my world.

956
02:03:50,053 --> 02:03:53,533
Then, join our tribe.

957
02:03:57,373 --> 02:03:59,093
We'll prepare a tent for you.

958
02:04:00,453 --> 02:04:01,893
Stay here, Sugay Hatun.

959
02:04:05,133 --> 02:04:07,093
Pain had made me lose my way.

960
02:04:07,973 --> 02:04:09,013
You helped me.

961
02:04:10,773 --> 02:04:14,413
From now on, I'll feed Osman.

962
02:04:16,973 --> 02:04:18,693
I'll look after him.

963
02:04:26,853 --> 02:04:28,173
Then, from now on,

964
02:04:30,013 --> 02:04:32,853
you're my daughter too, Sugay.

965
02:04:35,053 --> 02:04:36,413
Welcome,

966
02:04:37,173 --> 02:04:38,493
and thank you.

967
02:04:39,133 --> 02:04:40,333
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

968
02:04:45,013 --> 02:04:46,933
<i>Permission to enter, my Bey?</i>

969
02:04:53,413 --> 02:04:54,413
Come in.

970
02:04:58,853 --> 02:05:00,813
-Speak.
-Almıla Hatun has arrived.

971
02:05:01,093 --> 02:05:02,253
She asks for you.

972
02:05:02,973 --> 02:05:04,093
Let's go, Abdur Rahman.

973
02:05:13,213 --> 02:05:14,693
I'll stay with Osman.

974
02:05:14,893 --> 02:05:15,893
Don't worry.

975
02:06:28,453 --> 02:06:30,573
The spirits are with you, Noyan.

976
02:06:33,173 --> 02:06:34,533
Know that...

977
02:06:36,013 --> 02:06:37,013
Ertuğrul...

978
02:06:38,733 --> 02:06:40,493
will bring suffering.

979
02:06:41,973 --> 02:06:43,653
I killed ten sheep.

980
02:06:44,613 --> 02:06:46,773
Sculpted a leg bone.

981
02:06:48,053 --> 02:06:51,373
Gave it to the fire and saw the future.

982
02:06:53,893 --> 02:06:54,893
I saw that...

983
02:06:58,053 --> 02:06:59,373
I saw that...

984
02:07:00,773 --> 02:07:02,133
I saw that...

985
02:07:03,173 --> 02:07:04,373
Ertuğrul...

986
02:07:18,733 --> 02:07:19,733
Ertuğrul...

987
02:07:48,693 --> 02:07:52,013
The spirits that have not abandoned me...

988
02:07:53,933 --> 02:07:56,173
keep me away from all harm.

989
02:07:57,693 --> 02:08:00,413
Be the guardians of the night.

990
02:08:03,053 --> 02:08:04,853
You raised me from the grave

991
02:08:05,773 --> 02:08:08,253
and gave me titles.

992
02:08:10,693 --> 02:08:11,693
I swear.

993
02:08:14,493 --> 02:08:15,893
I'll kill Ertuğrul,

994
02:08:16,693 --> 02:08:20,333
and make tents out of Turks' skins.

995
02:08:21,773 --> 02:08:24,573
May Erlik Khan's dark sons accompany me.

996
02:08:25,813 --> 02:08:28,533
May my enemies suffer in Red Tamu.

997
02:08:31,053 --> 02:08:33,093
May dark spirits help me.

998
02:08:34,453 --> 02:08:36,973
May dark spirits help me.

999
02:08:38,333 --> 02:08:40,693
May dark spirits help me.

1000
02:08:49,253 --> 02:08:50,413
<i>Permission to enter?</i>

1001
02:08:51,053 --> 02:08:52,253
Come in, Almıla Hatun.

1002
02:09:03,493 --> 02:09:04,853
Welcome, Almıla Hatun.

1003
02:09:05,213 --> 02:09:06,213
Thank you.

1004
02:09:07,613 --> 02:09:11,493
The alps set up an ambush for the Governor
when they heard about his plans.

1005
02:09:12,253 --> 02:09:13,333
What happened?

1006
02:09:13,893 --> 02:09:16,413
Your alps killed the soldiers.

1007
02:09:19,493 --> 02:09:21,533
And I went ahead in your mourning day

1008
02:09:21,653 --> 02:09:24,493
and took care of the attacker,
my Bey Ertuğrul.

1009
02:09:39,933 --> 02:09:41,253
Governor Kritos.

1010
02:09:47,893 --> 02:09:51,733
His head is worthy of resting
below your feet.

1011
02:09:55,253 --> 02:09:57,653
Your alps are fine, don't worry.

1012
02:10:06,453 --> 02:10:09,733
It's not easy for a woman to kill
a Governor.

1013
02:10:14,853 --> 02:10:16,773
You're very brave, Almıla Hatun.

1014
02:10:23,573 --> 02:10:25,733
We respect you.

1015
02:10:29,893 --> 02:10:34,293
From now on, if anyone messes
with our trade,

1016
02:10:34,773 --> 02:10:36,693
he'll be punished, Ertuğrul Bey.

1017
02:10:39,933 --> 02:10:41,533
<i>Permission to enter, my Bey?</i>

1018
02:10:42,693 --> 02:10:43,933
Come, Günalp Bey.

1019
02:10:57,813 --> 02:11:00,973
Almıla Hatun beheaded the Governor.

1020
02:11:08,413 --> 02:11:09,653
What news do you have?

1021
02:11:12,013 --> 02:11:13,573
We have bad news.

1022
02:11:17,373 --> 02:11:18,373
Tell me.

1023
02:11:21,093 --> 02:11:22,733
Is it Turgut and Bamsı?

1024
02:11:28,973 --> 02:11:31,013
Turgut Bey, Chief Alp Bamsı.

1025
02:12:02,893 --> 02:12:03,893
Ahmet.

1026
02:12:04,533 --> 02:12:05,693
Oh God.

1027
02:12:10,813 --> 02:12:11,813
Ahmet.

1028
02:12:16,693 --> 02:12:17,693
My brother.

1029
02:12:21,853 --> 02:12:22,853
Ahmet.

1030
02:12:28,613 --> 02:12:30,013
Who killed you?

1031
02:12:31,413 --> 02:12:32,493
Who did this?

1032
02:12:34,853 --> 02:12:35,973
How did this happen?

1033
02:12:38,333 --> 02:12:39,333
Who did it?

1034
02:12:40,133 --> 02:12:42,693
That dog, Governor Kritos,
killed and hung him.

1035
02:12:47,533 --> 02:12:48,533
My brother.

1036
02:12:50,213 --> 02:12:52,213
You followed God's path

1037
02:12:52,773 --> 02:12:55,613
and made many sacrifices for our cause.

1038
02:12:56,493 --> 02:12:58,213
Now, you gave your life

1039
02:12:59,253 --> 02:13:01,973
and became a martyr.

1040
02:13:04,813 --> 02:13:08,293
May you and all our martyrs rest in peace.

1041
02:13:10,973 --> 02:13:13,693
Bless every single drop of blood you shed.

1042
02:13:16,213 --> 02:13:17,493
We'll beat the enemy,

1043
02:13:18,413 --> 02:13:19,933
take the world,

1044
02:13:20,773 --> 02:13:23,453
and put the souls of our martyrs to rest.

1045
02:13:27,293 --> 02:13:31,013
God willing, we'll never stop
until our cause prevails

1046
02:13:31,773 --> 02:13:33,533
everywhere in the world.

1047
02:13:34,253 --> 02:13:37,933
Until the last of us meets death.
