WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 99 will start after 12:49 min.

12:59.576 --> 13:03.256
Know that I don't fear death.

13:04.456 --> 13:08.576
But I did not poison you!

13:14.096 --> 13:17.456
I am not guilty of this treachery!

13:22.776 --> 13:23.976
Enough!

13:28.936 --> 13:30.136
What is it, Artuk Bey?

13:31.096 --> 13:32.216
Stop, my Bey.

14:00.776 --> 14:05.496
My Bey, Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut Alp
were not poisoned by Bahadir Bey.

14:07.176 --> 14:08.656
What are you saying, Artuk Bey?

14:09.256 --> 14:14.256
I found the poison given to the Sultan
in the cave of the herbalist, my Bey.

14:15.496 --> 14:17.536
-Are you sure?
-I am sure, my Bey.

14:19.736 --> 14:24.096
The poison that was given
to our sultan contained wolfsbane.

14:24.616 --> 14:29.376
Among other poisonous herbs.
I'm sure, my Bey. Absolutely sure.

14:31.576 --> 14:36.376
Bahadir wasn't here when
our sultan was poisoned.

14:37.816 --> 14:40.456
My Bey, whoever poisoned the sultan

14:40.616 --> 14:43.696
also poisoned Turgut Alp
and Aslıhan Hatun.

14:45.576 --> 14:49.736
This person used Esma and Bahadir's alp

14:50.456 --> 14:54.216
so that we would pin the blame on him.

14:56.936 --> 14:58.896
Only one person is capable of this.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.856
Emir Sadettin!

15:13.336 --> 15:15.376
-Brother! Brother!
-Turgut!

15:16.696 --> 15:17.736
Stop.

15:24.096 --> 15:25.416
You weren't poisoned...

15:27.576 --> 15:28.856
by Bahadir Bey.

15:31.216 --> 15:32.856
Release Bahadir Bey.

15:36.016 --> 15:37.096
Untie his alps.

15:54.896 --> 15:56.256
You...

15:56.936 --> 15:59.576
humiliated me for nothing.

16:00.536 --> 16:05.216
How do you intend to make amends?

16:06.776 --> 16:09.576
Consider it your punishment

16:10.736 --> 16:12.736
for the evil you have spread up until now.

16:14.496 --> 16:18.456
I suggest you get a grip of yourself
from this point on

16:19.096 --> 16:23.456
so that your head might remain
upon your shoulders.

16:25.976 --> 16:27.256
That's all I'll say.

16:52.336 --> 16:54.816
We'll discuss this later, Turgut.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.496
Be wary of Bahadir from now on.

16:59.656 --> 17:03.616
He'll come after you
for his revenge sooner or later.

17:05.536 --> 17:07.336
As you command, my Bey.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.936
What is Niko the Merchant
doing with all these soldiers, Atsiz?

17:58.656 --> 18:03.336
Ares must have asked
the emperor for reinforcements.

18:10.976 --> 18:13.656
That's a good-sized Byzantine unit.

18:14.096 --> 18:15.496
If we can't stop them...

18:16.616 --> 18:18.656
they'll cause us problems
when we attack the castle.

18:20.496 --> 18:23.536
Abdurrahman, go quickly.

18:24.496 --> 18:26.296
Ertuğrul Bey should know about this.

18:26.616 --> 18:27.776
What will you do?

18:30.616 --> 18:32.776
I'll try to infiltrate them.

18:34.096 --> 18:36.816
I'll see what I can learn
from this merchant, Niko.

18:38.936 --> 18:40.536
God help you, my Bey.

18:41.176 --> 18:42.736
They've travelled far.

18:44.496 --> 18:46.976
They have carriages full of equipment.

18:49.936 --> 18:51.416
They can't travel at night.

18:53.056 --> 18:55.456
They'll set up camp soon.

18:57.256 --> 19:01.496
Abdurrahman, this will have
to be done tomorrow. Be quick.

19:02.456 --> 19:03.456
All right.

19:41.656 --> 19:46.336
Hopefully this balm will heal
the wounds caused by the poison.

19:48.016 --> 19:49.456
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

19:51.136 --> 19:56.056
Thank God this curse has gone
from your bodies.

19:56.376 --> 19:57.536
Thank God.

19:58.936 --> 20:03.776
God spared your lives and gave you
back to us, my beautiful daughter.

20:04.336 --> 20:09.576
Thank you, Mother Hayme.
May God keep you with us.

20:13.776 --> 20:15.016
Who did this?

20:17.336 --> 20:20.336
Who dared infiltrate our tribe?

20:20.816 --> 20:23.056
Who had us poisoned in our own home?

20:33.576 --> 20:39.056
Turgut Alp, we don't have any evidence
yet, but we'll find out who it was.

20:42.976 --> 20:45.056
Alpamis was Bahadir Bey's alp.

20:46.896 --> 20:49.496
Given we know Alpamis had
something to do with this,

20:50.256 --> 20:52.936
why did you let Bahadir go, Ertuğrul Bey?

20:55.816 --> 21:00.456
There are some secrets
which are heavier than mountains.

21:01.616 --> 21:04.256
If they're revealed at the wrong time
they would crush everyone.

21:08.296 --> 21:12.056
He killed Alpamis and Esma
to leave no traces behind.

21:13.336 --> 21:14.496
Don't worry.

21:15.096 --> 21:21.456
I'll find out who was ultimately
responsible for having you poisoned...

21:23.296 --> 21:24.736
sooner or later.

21:26.016 --> 21:28.256
Then the world will know who he is.

21:34.976 --> 21:36.816
What about the conquest
of Karacahisar, my Bey?

21:39.216 --> 21:41.136
Nothing's changed
in respect of that, Turgut.

21:41.736 --> 21:44.296
We'll return home
and continue preparations.

21:45.176 --> 21:48.216
You stay here. Gather our forces.

21:49.696 --> 21:51.016
Assemble the beys.

21:52.216 --> 21:56.296
Bahadir is furious. Be careful.

21:58.096 --> 22:00.456
His fury can't touch me, my Bey.

22:01.416 --> 22:02.776
Don't worry.

22:03.376 --> 22:05.616
Thanks, Turgut. Thanks.

22:27.816 --> 22:30.056
I don't care if they'd shed
only one drop of your blood,

22:30.536 --> 22:32.696
I'll make them pay for an eternity,
my Bey.

22:35.776 --> 22:41.536
He humiliated me and my alps
on my turf and in front of everyone.

22:43.616 --> 22:47.656
I'll drown him and his alps
in their own blood.

22:49.056 --> 22:51.296
I'll make Ertuğrul regret what he's done.

22:53.416 --> 22:57.336
Look at what they did
to the great Bahadir Bey and his wife!

22:58.616 --> 23:01.296
We shouldn't so much as
let them breathe, my Bey.

23:03.576 --> 23:09.176
If they try to make that man bey
tomorrow, I won't stand for it.

23:09.696 --> 23:13.376
What did you just say, wife?
How could he possibly be bey before I die?

23:16.696 --> 23:22.456
I'd rather burn this tent and this tribe
to the ground than hand them over to them.

23:23.936 --> 23:29.416
I'll kill whoever stands in my way
and leave his body for the carrion.

23:31.456 --> 23:33.216
The dye has been cast.

23:36.616 --> 23:40.576
Dark clouds have been gathering
above them for some time.

23:41.976 --> 23:48.216
Henceforth, they'll have all kinds
of trouble raining down upon them!

23:52.376 --> 23:56.336
When Sancar arrives with his alps...

23:59.496 --> 24:02.376
I'll attack Aslıhan Hatun's tent.

24:04.096 --> 24:07.096
Who among them is capable
of escaping your grasp, my Bey?

24:07.576 --> 24:09.936
I'll kill them both
with my own two hands.

24:12.056 --> 24:18.016
Let Ertuğrul see then
who enjoys the last laugh.

24:49.136 --> 24:50.936
A stranger approaches!

25:01.696 --> 25:02.896
Let him approach!

25:25.296 --> 25:27.616
Who are you? What do you want here?

25:30.296 --> 25:33.336
Brave warriors of Jesus!

25:34.656 --> 25:37.136
God bless you all!

25:39.136 --> 25:42.056
I'm a merchant from Hanli bazaar.

25:43.416 --> 25:44.736
My name is Alfonso.

25:47.976 --> 25:49.176
What is it you seek, merchant?

25:50.496 --> 25:51.936
There are a lot of bandits around.

25:52.536 --> 25:54.376
I'm worried about traveling
to the castle alone.

25:54.736 --> 25:58.136
I'd be grateful if I was allowed to spend
the night in your camp, commander.

26:04.136 --> 26:08.136
Your name is Alfonso. Are you from Venice?

26:12.696 --> 26:16.336
No! No, sir.

26:18.376 --> 26:19.256
I am from Genova.

26:25.696 --> 26:27.976
Welcome to Arycanda.

26:28.816 --> 26:30.416
Thank you.

26:32.056 --> 26:33.496
Take Alfonso the Merchant's horse.

26:41.496 --> 26:46.656
So, you're a merchant?
What do you trade at Hanli Bazaar?

26:48.136 --> 26:52.576
My customers are usually Turks.
I sell whatever they desire.

26:53.376 --> 26:57.376
Most of your clients are Turks?
Then you'll know them well.

27:02.416 --> 27:04.616
I know those barbarians all too well.

27:08.816 --> 27:10.736
I'd like to hear what you know.

27:12.136 --> 27:15.696
Commander, the merchant will be
our guest until we get to the castle.

27:17.336 --> 27:20.496
Take his sword.
He can have it back tomorrow morning.

27:22.416 --> 27:23.456
God bless you.

27:30.336 --> 27:32.696
My name is Niko. I'm a merchant too.

27:34.336 --> 27:36.576
Ertuğrul, Bey of the Kayis is back.

27:37.576 --> 27:40.416
Tell me, what do the traders
of Hanli bazaar say about that?

27:42.216 --> 27:45.416
The Turks are happy Ertuğrul's back.

27:45.776 --> 27:46.896
But not you.

27:48.176 --> 27:51.056
Does Ertuğrul Bey not get along
with Christian merchants?

27:53.336 --> 27:57.256
Ertuğrul Bey treats everyone equally.

27:58.816 --> 28:00.256
But that's irrelevant.

28:01.256 --> 28:02.416
He's a Turk.

28:03.336 --> 28:05.656
We don't want a Turk holding the reins.

28:06.056 --> 28:09.896
You make the most of the gold you take
off the Turks, but you don't like them.

28:10.296 --> 28:14.336
I'm not your average merchant
who only thinks of profit.

28:15.696 --> 28:19.136
Until the Turks are thrown
out of these lands,

28:20.096 --> 28:21.896
we'll never have order here.

28:23.816 --> 28:28.176
Both smart and loyal.
It'll be a pleasure talking with you.

28:28.856 --> 28:31.536
But rest now, we can continue this later.

28:37.256 --> 28:40.296
-The soldiers should rest.
-As you wish.

29:09.296 --> 29:12.016
The knights continue their training.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.176
They improve every day, thanks to you.

29:15.376 --> 29:17.176
It won't be enough, Kostas.

29:18.376 --> 29:21.576
The Turks have alps who can shoot
arrows accurately from horseback.

29:22.616 --> 29:24.896
They're all ready to die and go to heaven.

29:25.496 --> 29:28.696
They're skillful enough to scale
the walls of this castle.

29:29.896 --> 29:33.456
Whatever we do, it won't be enough
when the war begins.

29:34.776 --> 29:38.176
The units coming from Nicaea
will make us stronger, sir.

29:38.416 --> 29:39.456
Exactly.

29:40.256 --> 29:42.296
The merchant who came
with the soldiers, Niko...

29:43.136 --> 29:46.176
I can use him to control
the trade in these lands, Kostas.

29:46.976 --> 29:49.456
He's as precious to me as an army.

29:50.616 --> 29:52.456
Will Ertuğrul stand for that?

29:53.976 --> 29:56.416
I saved Ertuğrul's best friend.

29:57.176 --> 29:58.456
He's indebted to me.

29:59.096 --> 30:02.936
My first request will deal with trade.
He won't be able to refuse.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.376
I have no concerns about Ertuğrul.

30:06.216 --> 30:08.336
But first, the envoy
and soldiers must get here.

30:09.216 --> 30:12.136
We'll be a lot stronger
militarily and economically then.

30:14.816 --> 30:17.456
And Bahadir? What's the latest update?

30:17.816 --> 30:22.016
Ertuğrul humiliated him thoroughly,
in front of his own people too.

30:23.576 --> 30:27.016
-Bahadir is furious with Ertuğrul.
-Very good.

30:28.136 --> 30:30.336
Bahadir isn't on good terms
with Emir Sadettin.

30:30.816 --> 30:32.216
And now he's enemies with Ertuğrul.

30:33.136 --> 30:36.016
He's like a tiger that
wants to rip its prey apart.

30:36.976 --> 30:38.816
An ideal partner for me.

30:39.696 --> 30:41.376
What are your orders, sir?

30:43.456 --> 30:46.976
Go to Bahadir at once. Tell him
I want to talk to him over dinner.

30:47.536 --> 30:49.496
Let's see if he wants to be our new ally.

30:50.536 --> 30:52.416
If it happens as I think it will,

30:53.016 --> 30:55.976
I can't even imagine
what we'll do to Ertuğrul.

30:57.496 --> 30:58.816
As you command, sir.

31:41.976 --> 31:43.816
Have you spotted the well?

31:44.056 --> 31:47.136
We have, my Bey.
We await your permission to dig it.

31:48.416 --> 31:51.616
-Is it close to the tribe?
-It is, my Bey.

31:52.416 --> 31:53.376
All right.

31:54.456 --> 31:58.416
One well wasn't enough during the summer.
A second well will be good for the people.

31:59.016 --> 32:03.376
Prepare the stones well.
Get a stonemason if needed.

32:03.536 --> 32:04.696
As you wish, my Bey.

32:13.976 --> 32:18.176
Artuk Bey, has a place been spotted
close by Hanli bazaar for a well?

32:18.776 --> 32:24.296
My Bey, following your order,
I assigned three people to the task.

32:24.816 --> 32:28.016
They'll fulfil that duty soon.

32:28.496 --> 32:29.616
All right.

32:31.936 --> 32:33.776
How are your alps, Bamsi?

32:34.136 --> 32:37.816
They're well, my Bey. Training continues.

32:38.016 --> 32:41.456
The alps are impatient
to attack the castle.

32:44.456 --> 32:48.896
Turgut Alp will live with
the Cavdar tribe from now on.

32:50.336 --> 32:53.056
Hopefully, he'll become their bey.

32:56.496 --> 33:01.176
You'll be responsible
for the alps from now on.

33:03.256 --> 33:06.056
-You're the head alp now, Bamsi.
-Thank you.

33:06.296 --> 33:08.456
As you command my Bey.

33:08.856 --> 33:12.696
I'll perform my duties honorably, my Bey.

33:13.176 --> 33:14.576
Thank you, Bamsi. Thank you.

33:26.776 --> 33:30.616
Thank God, seeing you
like this has reassured us.

33:32.656 --> 33:37.776
Who would dare do such a thing
to the Hatun of the Cavdar tribe?

33:38.096 --> 33:40.816
We should take their heads.

33:41.336 --> 33:43.936
-He's right.
-Let's take their heads.

33:44.016 --> 33:48.096
-Cut their heads off.
-How could this happen?

33:48.176 --> 33:49.296
My beys...

33:50.256 --> 33:54.696
Ertuğrul Bey and I will not let this go.

33:55.376 --> 33:57.496
But there are more pressing matters
in front of us.

33:58.176 --> 34:02.136
The unity and very existence
of the Cavdar tribe is under threat.

34:03.016 --> 34:06.496
We must look to preserve our unity first.

34:06.896 --> 34:10.816
-True. He's right.
-The threat must be defeated.

34:14.776 --> 34:20.016
Bahadir Bey is out of control.
His fury knows no limits.

34:20.616 --> 34:25.176
Our fear is that he might attempt
to hurt the people of the Cavdar tribe

34:25.496 --> 34:28.976
and damage our kinship
with the Kayi tribe.

34:31.336 --> 34:34.376
Bahadir Bey suffered too, Aslıhan Hatun.

34:34.776 --> 34:39.616
He and his wife were humiliated unfairly.
His honor was tarnished.

34:44.096 --> 34:47.456
You forget what Bahadir Bey
has done in the past, Ivaz Bey.

34:48.456 --> 34:51.256
Don't forget what he did
to Ertuğrul Bey at the inn.

34:54.016 --> 34:56.216
And it was Alpamis
who gave the poison to Esma.

34:58.816 --> 35:02.056
Alpamis was Bahadir's alp.
Or didn't you know that?

35:03.576 --> 35:07.056
-How could this happen?
-How could Bahadir Bey attempt this?

35:07.256 --> 35:08.296
Impossible.

35:08.936 --> 35:11.216
If he believed Bahadir Bey was guilty,

35:11.456 --> 35:13.856
why did Ertuğrul Bey let him go free?

35:17.736 --> 35:21.776
Ertuğrul Bey learned Bahadir Bey
hadn't given the poison to Alpamis,

35:22.376 --> 35:23.496
so he freed him.

35:25.056 --> 35:27.656
Bahadir Bey was unable
to control his own alp.

35:28.016 --> 35:33.496
His mistake almost led to my death
and that of Aslıhan Hatun.

35:34.016 --> 35:37.216
-He's right.
-True.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.096
Ertuğrul Bey knows what he's doing.

35:40.936 --> 35:44.656
When the time comes,
he'll tell us everything.

35:45.816 --> 35:50.256
For now, we must focus on keeping
our tribe unified and safe.

35:50.656 --> 35:51.816
He's right.

35:53.896 --> 35:57.816
To this end, I, Hatun
of the Cavdar tribe, demand

35:58.256 --> 36:00.776
a council is convened as soon as possible

36:01.176 --> 36:04.576
to elect Turgut Alp as our bey.

36:17.456 --> 36:19.416
I still don't understand it, my Bey.

36:19.816 --> 36:22.376
How could Emir Sadettin
try something like this?

36:23.656 --> 36:27.176
How could he become so angry that
he was able to do such a terrible thing

36:27.296 --> 36:28.696
to two innocent people, my Bey?

36:31.096 --> 36:36.296
Rage consumes the mind, Artuk Bey.

36:36.896 --> 36:40.816
My Bey, what kind of rage is this?
What kind of rage could have possessed him

36:40.896 --> 36:43.896
to the extent he even tried
to poison the Seljuk Sultan?

36:44.456 --> 36:45.976
Why would he do it, my Bey?

36:46.336 --> 36:51.056
It's obvious he wants
to be Sultan instead of Emir.

36:52.416 --> 36:57.576
My Bey, is it not our duty
to tell our sultan of this?

37:01.216 --> 37:03.896
We will, Artuk Bey, we will.

37:04.976 --> 37:07.176
As soon as we take Karacahisar Castle

37:07.776 --> 37:11.056
I'll go to the sultan myself
to tell him everything we've learned.

37:13.296 --> 37:19.376
But this must remain a secret
known only to you and me until then.

37:19.496 --> 37:23.776
Don't worry, my Bey.
I know how important this is.

37:27.776 --> 37:28.976
Artuk Bey...

37:30.656 --> 37:34.016
our state and Sultan face a deadly threat.

37:35.696 --> 37:40.376
It is our duty to defeat this threat.

37:42.736 --> 37:44.816
If something should happen to me...

37:45.656 --> 37:49.256
I want you to tell our sultan
what we've discovered.

37:51.056 --> 37:52.376
As you command, my Bey.

37:53.056 --> 37:57.496
May God protect our state and our sultan.

37:58.256 --> 37:59.176
Amen.

38:01.896 --> 38:02.896
Amen.

38:09.536 --> 38:10.856
Aslıhan Hatun is right.

38:13.016 --> 38:14.576
Aslıhan Hatun is right.

38:19.376 --> 38:21.096
I support Aslıhan Hatun's decision.

38:25.736 --> 38:26.896
My beys...

38:28.656 --> 38:32.056
Turgut Alp has led our alps into battle.

38:32.616 --> 38:35.456
He has their love and respect.

38:36.136 --> 38:40.416
He protected us against the Crusaders,
Governor Vasilius, even my brother Ural.

38:40.776 --> 38:45.976
He deserves to be our Bey.
He is worthy of being our Bey.

38:46.456 --> 38:50.296
He'll make our kinship
with the Kayis eternal.

38:54.296 --> 38:57.176
Bahadir Bey has Cavdar blood.
He's your uncle.

38:57.896 --> 39:01.016
Can a stranger be our bey when
someone with Cavdar blood still lives?

39:02.296 --> 39:06.296
It is not a question of blood,
Ivaz Bey, it is one of merit.

39:07.056 --> 39:09.056
Our unity is threatened.

39:09.776 --> 39:14.376
The enemy grows stronger
and comes closer every day.

39:14.776 --> 39:17.016
For this reason, the Cavdar tribe

39:17.096 --> 39:21.496
needs a strong and brave bey
such as Turgut Alp.

39:21.776 --> 39:24.856
-Aslıhan Hatun is right.
-She speaks the truth.

39:26.376 --> 39:28.936
The Kayi and Cavdar tribes are one.

39:30.256 --> 39:31.616
No differences.

39:32.576 --> 39:35.896
We are Cavdar and we are Kayi.

39:36.616 --> 39:38.216
This is my tribe.

39:39.056 --> 39:45.096
It is my sworn duty to keep
the tribe both unified and strong.

39:46.256 --> 39:49.976
A strong bey makes
for a strong tribe and people.

39:50.456 --> 39:54.496
-May God grant us good fortune.
-Amen.

39:55.376 --> 39:57.176
-Amen.
-Amen.

39:57.776 --> 40:00.096
A council will be held soon.

40:12.742 --> 40:14.022
May I enter, my Bey?

40:15.542 --> 40:16.542
Come in, Bamsi!

40:26.502 --> 40:27.702
Sit down.

40:34.822 --> 40:36.502
Did you catch the trader, Abdurrahman?

40:36.942 --> 40:39.182
He was accompanied
by a lot of soldiers, my Bey.

40:39.702 --> 40:42.662
Atsiz is trying to
infiltrate the military unit

40:42.942 --> 40:44.662
so as to get information from Niko.

40:45.582 --> 40:48.182
He must have been worried
the trader might die in an ambush, my Bey.

40:48.262 --> 40:49.702
He wants to discover what he knows.

40:50.862 --> 40:53.422
He'll do what he said he'd do, Artuk Bey.

40:53.942 --> 40:58.622
The soldiers probably aren't here
purely to protect the merchant, my Bey.

41:00.782 --> 41:02.782
Ares asked for reinforcements.

41:04.662 --> 41:09.582
He makes a show of being our friend
but he's plotting behind our backs.

41:10.182 --> 41:12.902
But this will benefit us
more than it does him.

41:14.422 --> 41:17.582
His precautions are
going to backfire on him.

41:19.622 --> 41:21.182
What are we going to do, my Bey?

41:25.142 --> 41:29.222
We'll attack the soldiers
when they least expect it, Bamsi.

41:29.902 --> 41:33.742
Then, we'll enter castle dressed as them.

41:35.302 --> 41:38.622
So, so... We fight tomorrow, my Bey?

41:42.982 --> 41:46.582
God willing, we fight tomorrow.

41:47.902 --> 41:48.982
It's time for war.

41:52.862 --> 41:55.142
I'll lead the alps
disguised as the soldiers,

41:55.222 --> 41:58.582
while you get the remaining alps
ready to attack the castle, Artuk Bey.

41:58.742 --> 41:59.742
As you command, my Bey.

42:02.342 --> 42:06.062
Your job will be to prepare
the alps for the initial attack, Bamsi.

42:07.062 --> 42:10.142
-We'll set out at once.
-As you command, my Bey.

42:29.222 --> 42:30.102
Kirca!

42:31.302 --> 42:32.622
Yes, Chief Alp Turgut.

42:34.982 --> 42:38.782
Follow Ivaz Bey.
Keep an eye on him at all times.

42:39.382 --> 42:42.982
If he meets Bahadir Bey, let me know...
immediately.

42:43.182 --> 42:44.742
As you command, Chief Alp Turgut.

43:08.422 --> 43:10.502
We've overcome many troubles, Aslıhan.

43:12.342 --> 43:14.542
Curses fell upon us like rain.

43:15.702 --> 43:18.662
We narrowly escaped death. But...

43:21.022 --> 43:22.902
We never gave up, Aslıhan.

43:23.622 --> 43:25.982
I've caused you so much pain and torment.

43:26.742 --> 43:29.902
But at all times you thought only of me,
never yourself.

43:31.542 --> 43:33.822
I don't know how
I can ever repay you, Turgut.

43:36.542 --> 43:38.422
You're my wife, Aslıhan.

43:40.862 --> 43:44.022
You are my life, you are my blood.

43:46.142 --> 43:50.782
My one hope is to protect you...
from all harm.

44:00.862 --> 44:04.462
Hopefully, we have seen
the last of our troubles.

44:04.902 --> 44:07.022
Evil-doers can no longer reach us, Turgut.

44:09.622 --> 44:11.982
Our love is shielded by

44:12.662 --> 44:16.622
faith, belief and passion, Aslıhan.

44:19.942 --> 44:22.022
As long as we keep it that way,

44:24.062 --> 44:28.742
any dangers or hardships
we may face in the future,

44:30.222 --> 44:31.782
will spring back from whence they came.

45:03.462 --> 45:04.702
May I enter, my Bey?

45:07.622 --> 45:09.142
Come in, Kayatekin.

45:11.182 --> 45:12.262
My Bey...

45:14.302 --> 45:15.782
We've heard from Sancar Bey.

45:17.502 --> 45:21.662
He's at the Bloody Hill with the alps.
He awaits your word to attack.

45:22.182 --> 45:26.062
My brave son! Just in time.

45:27.462 --> 45:32.462
At last. No longer will we have
to keep our rage hidden within.

45:33.782 --> 45:36.662
We'll show them what kind
of man Bahadir Bey is.

45:39.382 --> 45:45.302
Tomorrow night I'll attack their tent
and take their heads myself.

45:47.182 --> 45:52.702
I shall become Bey and show everyone
who scorned me who Bahadir Bey really is.

45:54.422 --> 45:58.662
Ertuğrul can't stop me, not even
Sultan Alaeddin himself can stop me.

46:02.502 --> 46:04.382
-Kayatekin.
-Yes, my Bey.

46:04.702 --> 46:07.702
I will go and see Sancar
and the alps tomorrow.

46:08.462 --> 46:12.982
You will be responsible for
preparing our alps here for the attack.

46:13.182 --> 46:14.422
As you command, my Bey.

46:26.582 --> 46:30.302
The tables are turning at last, wife.

46:48.502 --> 46:51.262
God. God.

46:52.382 --> 46:57.462
I don't want to wear it but duty calls.
Forgive me, God. Forgive me.

46:59.542 --> 47:00.622
Amen.

47:04.822 --> 47:05.902
My god!

47:07.622 --> 47:08.662
Who are you?

47:09.222 --> 47:11.422
-Hafsa, what are you doing?
-Bamsi?

47:12.222 --> 47:13.302
What is this?

47:13.782 --> 47:17.382
Hafsa... Duty, I'm doing my duty.

47:17.582 --> 47:20.262
That's the reason
I'm wearing this infidel uniform.

47:20.622 --> 47:24.902
God... I was so scared!
I thought you were one of them!

47:25.262 --> 47:26.942
That's good, good...

47:27.222 --> 47:32.542
If my own wife believed it,
the infidels will surely fall for it.

47:33.902 --> 47:35.182
My sweet wife...

47:35.462 --> 47:39.342
I have to go now.
Let's say our goodbyes, come on.

47:43.782 --> 47:45.462
What's wrong, wife?

47:46.662 --> 47:50.862
I know it's you underneath that
but if I touch you

47:51.542 --> 47:54.102
I'll feel like I'm hugging one of them.

47:54.662 --> 47:58.262
Come on, Hafsa, don't be silly.
Let me say goodbye...

47:58.462 --> 47:59.662
No, no!

48:00.822 --> 48:04.462
Go now, please.
We'll hug all you want when you return.

48:06.302 --> 48:08.382
Go... Godspeed!

48:08.942 --> 48:11.102
My Hafsa... If that's what you want...

48:15.022 --> 48:18.662
Even the clothes of the infidel
bring me bad luck!

48:19.502 --> 48:22.382
Right then. I'll go.

48:37.342 --> 48:42.982
Tomorrow, we attack Karacahisar Castle
like hawks upon an owl's nest.

48:45.622 --> 48:49.462
I hope you return with a victory
worthy of you, son.

48:50.022 --> 48:53.542
May your sword be as sharp
as your cause is just.

48:54.422 --> 48:55.582
Thank you, Mother.

48:56.382 --> 48:58.822
I hope the battle is short, my Bey.

49:00.302 --> 49:02.622
Karacahisar is a formidable fortress.

49:03.422 --> 49:06.782
It will be hard to take,
though you know that better than I.

49:07.462 --> 49:10.182
We are strengthened by
two great forces, Halime.

49:10.542 --> 49:12.582
Effort and faith.

49:13.302 --> 49:16.182
As long as we put all our effort into it,

49:16.782 --> 49:22.582
a century might become a second.

49:23.862 --> 49:26.822
And as we give our all,
so will God give us faith.

49:28.542 --> 49:30.342
God willing, God willing.

49:33.102 --> 49:36.142
I can swing my sword
just like you showed me, Father.

49:36.462 --> 49:37.342
I've learned.

49:39.022 --> 49:40.702
My brave warrior.

49:42.302 --> 49:45.742
The way you swing your sword
is dictated by your enemy.

49:46.582 --> 49:50.782
You must find where he is weakest
and direct your sword to that point.

49:51.462 --> 49:52.582
How?

49:53.902 --> 49:54.982
Come.

50:00.142 --> 50:01.142
Listen, son...

50:01.742 --> 50:04.142
Once upon a time, the Oghuz tribe

50:04.302 --> 50:08.502
kept being attacked
by a monster called Tepegoz.

50:09.302 --> 50:14.622
The monster would eat 500 sheep
and two men every day.

50:15.742 --> 50:18.622
The Oghuz had no way of fighting it.

50:20.222 --> 50:24.502
At the time there lived a warrior
called Basat, son of Uruz.

50:24.982 --> 50:28.062
The monster Tepegoz killed his brother.

50:28.782 --> 50:33.742
So Basat swore an oath to kill Tepegoz.

50:34.582 --> 50:37.902
Even though everyone said
it was impossible,

50:38.022 --> 50:44.742
Basat took up his sword
and headed for Tepegoz's cave.

50:46.342 --> 50:48.902
-Did he kill it?
-Just wait.

50:51.982 --> 50:57.662
Basat had learned that the monster's
weakest spot was its eye.

50:58.582 --> 51:04.102
He found a place to hide
and heated a piece of metal over a fire.

51:04.702 --> 51:08.702
Then he stabbed Tepegoz
in the eye with it.

51:10.582 --> 51:15.982
Tepegoz screamed so loudly
that even the mountains trembled.

51:17.382 --> 51:21.262
Basat, after stabbing
the monster in its eye,

51:22.342 --> 51:25.102
slit its throat with
his sword and killed it.

51:25.862 --> 51:27.622
What a hero, Father!

51:29.662 --> 51:33.822
He who knows his enemy is always a hero.

51:35.422 --> 51:37.822
Always hit them where they are weakest.

51:38.582 --> 51:42.462
Just like Basat hitting Tepegoz
in the eye.

51:43.822 --> 51:45.982
-Got it?
-Yes, Father.

51:46.422 --> 51:47.502
Good boy!

51:50.382 --> 51:54.182
Go along now. I have things to do.
Keep swinging your sword.

52:01.262 --> 52:02.382
God protect you.

52:03.782 --> 52:05.262
May God protect you.

52:11.382 --> 52:14.462
Mother, Father is going to kill
all his enemies at the castle.

52:14.742 --> 52:16.542
I wish I could go too.

52:20.462 --> 52:24.982
What castle, Gündüz?
Put down your sword and go to bed. Now.

52:29.542 --> 52:31.982
Your father will take you
on a hunt, tomorrow.

52:32.342 --> 52:34.902
Sleep now so that morning comes quick.

52:37.542 --> 52:39.662
Go now. Sweet dreams.

52:39.782 --> 52:41.622
-Sweet dreams, dear.
-Come on.

53:13.382 --> 53:17.902
Commerce is unknown to Turks.
They understand only one thing.

53:18.662 --> 53:19.662
War.

53:21.942 --> 53:23.062
Scoundrels!

53:23.902 --> 53:26.262
They'll be sent back to the hell
from whence they came.

53:27.542 --> 53:29.902
I heard that Commander Ares
is a great warrior.

53:31.062 --> 53:32.222
Only a man like him...

53:33.502 --> 53:35.742
can be relied upon to succeed.

53:36.542 --> 53:38.142
You heard right, Alfonso.

53:40.622 --> 53:44.462
It'd be much better for us
if Governor Ares controlled Hanli bazaar.

53:44.862 --> 53:48.582
Commander Ares wanted the emperor
to send me here anyway.

53:51.702 --> 53:54.262
How well do you know Commander Ares?

53:55.622 --> 53:59.502
I don't. Not at all. Never even met him.

54:00.622 --> 54:03.822
All I know is that he's a great warrior.
That's it.

54:05.182 --> 54:06.822
If a warrior like Commander Ares

54:07.022 --> 54:11.262
and a merchant like you ruled
Hanli bazaar, we'd all be rich.

54:22.502 --> 54:25.382
Ertuğrul Bey! You just won't die.

54:27.502 --> 54:28.462
Don't worry...

54:29.222 --> 54:30.582
It's not over yet.

54:31.262 --> 54:32.702
Come to Karacahisar with us.

54:33.022 --> 54:35.782
I'm sure Commander Ares will be
pleased to make your acquaintance.

54:36.382 --> 54:39.022
I'd be glad of that too,
Merchant Niko.

54:51.182 --> 54:52.222
What's wrong?

54:53.542 --> 54:57.342
The wheel's broken.
We can't move until it's fixed.

55:25.342 --> 55:26.822
I own several carriages.

55:27.262 --> 55:29.702
I know how to fix them. I'd like to help.

55:40.862 --> 55:41.782
Speak.

55:42.142 --> 55:44.462
Turgut Alp and Aslıhan Hatun
gathered us together last night.

55:44.902 --> 55:47.222
They asked us to support
Turgut Alp being elected Bey.

55:48.902 --> 55:50.662
How dare they!

55:51.502 --> 55:53.382
After everything they've done...

55:54.702 --> 55:57.422
they still want to usurp my birth right.

55:57.982 --> 56:00.382
I don't know about the others
but I don't support it, my Bey.

56:00.702 --> 56:04.102
You were right. Ertuğrul is doing it
to seize control of our tribe.

56:07.022 --> 56:08.422
Look at me!

56:08.702 --> 56:11.822
Do I look like the sort of man who'd let

56:11.902 --> 56:14.262
Ertuğrul's chief alp
take my tribe from me?

56:14.902 --> 56:16.062
No, my Bey.

56:20.622 --> 56:23.742
They thought I'd stand silently by,

56:24.102 --> 56:27.102
no matter what they do to provoke me.

56:28.062 --> 56:31.542
I'll show them my claws
and roar so loudly they'll be in no doubt

56:32.702 --> 56:35.702
that the lion still lives.

57:48.822 --> 57:51.142
Training must continue.

58:10.462 --> 58:13.302
Keep a close watch over everything.

58:27.822 --> 58:28.822
Hello, hero.

58:38.862 --> 58:42.222
You don't look very happy.
What happened?

58:42.542 --> 58:46.102
My father was meant to take me on a hunt.
But he hasn't come home yet.

58:48.902 --> 58:50.542
I saw your father ride away.

58:52.742 --> 58:54.262
Did he go far away?

58:58.302 --> 59:00.262
If I knew where he went...

59:02.502 --> 59:04.822
I'd be able to tell you
when he'll get back.

59:08.662 --> 59:12.222
So be it.
I can't help if you don't tell me.

59:14.982 --> 59:16.822
He went to fight.

59:22.462 --> 59:23.462
Where?

59:24.782 --> 59:26.782
Karacahisar Castle.

59:31.702 --> 59:33.342
Karacahisar Castle?

59:40.702 --> 59:43.262
You know what? Don't worry.

59:45.702 --> 59:47.742
I've got some good news for you.

59:49.902 --> 59:52.342
-The flying horse is coming.
-The flying horse?

59:52.542 --> 59:55.782
Be quiet. If anybody hears,
the horse won't come.

00:59:57.302 --> 01:00:01.902
If you want to see it, come
to the big tree behind the tribe. Okay?

01:00:02.782 --> 01:00:04.022
I'll wait for you there.

01:00:04.782 --> 01:00:09.022
And... your first hunt will be
on a flying horse.

01:00:10.342 --> 01:00:12.142
But don't be dressed like an alp.

01:00:12.422 --> 01:00:14.302
-The horse will be scared.
-Okay, okay.

01:00:18.102 --> 01:00:21.662
Don't forget what I said.
Come by yourself and don't tell anyone.

01:00:21.982 --> 01:00:25.182
If anyone else knows,
the horse will go away, deal?

01:00:25.342 --> 01:00:28.182
Deal. I won't tell a soul.

01:00:29.262 --> 01:00:33.782
Okay. Go to the tent and get ready.
I'll be waiting for you.

01:00:39.582 --> 01:00:40.582
What's up, Darius?

01:00:42.182 --> 01:00:44.582
Nothing. We were just talking.

01:00:47.302 --> 01:00:49.742
Darius tells good stories.

01:00:54.142 --> 01:00:55.142
All right then.

01:00:56.982 --> 01:00:57.982
Alps!

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:40.942
Ivaz Bey went
straight to Bahadir Bey's tent.

01:01:43.862 --> 01:01:46.142
He probably told him everything.

01:01:47.182 --> 01:01:49.302
He won't stay down now.

01:01:49.422 --> 01:01:53.182
Kirca, be well prepared.
Bahadir will make his move soon.

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:54.662
As you command, Chief Alp Turgut.

01:02:01.102 --> 01:02:03.422
How dare you enter without permission?

01:02:03.822 --> 01:02:05.422
You slandered me.

01:02:06.782 --> 01:02:08.662
You humiliated me.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:15.302
Instead of asking for my forgiveness
you claim my right for your own!

01:02:16.382 --> 01:02:21.102
Are you wholly without shame?

01:02:21.582 --> 01:02:24.822
Know your place, Bahadir Bey.
Know your place!

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.862
You're the one who doesn't know his place!

01:02:30.982 --> 01:02:33.262
Being Bey is my right!

01:02:35.582 --> 01:02:41.142
I'll burn this tent down if I have to,
but I won't let you take my right!

01:02:44.142 --> 01:02:46.022
My wife is the Hatun.

01:02:46.822 --> 01:02:51.142
It is my right as much as yours...
to be Bey.

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:56.662
If you're so confident of your right,
face me in the council...

01:02:57.702 --> 01:02:58.742
and claim it.

01:02:59.702 --> 01:03:02.022
Even admitting your right
to challenge me...

01:03:03.662 --> 01:03:06.902
would besmirch the good name of the tribe.

01:03:12.542 --> 01:03:15.822
You... are a Kayi alp.

01:03:17.822 --> 01:03:21.142
You have no right
to be Bey of the Cavdars!

01:03:21.782 --> 01:03:22.822
Enough!

01:03:23.462 --> 01:03:25.102
It was Ertuğrul Bey's decision.

01:03:25.942 --> 01:03:30.142
Turgut will stand. And you will accept it.

01:03:32.342 --> 01:03:33.662
Ertuğrul Bey...

01:03:37.382 --> 01:03:38.862
And what if I don't?

01:03:42.982 --> 01:03:47.462
Then your neck will know my axe.

01:03:47.862 --> 01:03:48.862
But...

01:03:51.342 --> 01:03:54.102
nobody will save you this time.

01:03:59.342 --> 01:04:03.062
I'm warning you for the last time.

01:04:04.902 --> 01:04:07.382
Drop this claim...

01:04:08.862 --> 01:04:11.262
and don't stand in my way.

01:04:16.182 --> 01:04:17.902
You know where we are, Bahadir Bey.

01:04:19.302 --> 01:04:21.262
We'll be waiting for you.

01:04:26.742 --> 01:04:29.462
I tried everything I could.

01:04:35.302 --> 01:04:40.382
I'll gladly shed my blood...
if that's what it takes to stop you.

01:04:41.582 --> 01:04:47.342
You'll see who Bahadir Bey... really is.

01:04:57.702 --> 01:04:58.742
Door!

01:05:03.902 --> 01:05:06.902
Kirca... Follow him wherever he goes.

01:05:09.302 --> 01:05:11.502
I want to know everything he does.

01:05:12.142 --> 01:05:13.542
As you command, Chief Alp Turgut.

01:05:47.022 --> 01:05:51.902
Atsiz has infiltrated them.
He broke the wheel to slow them down.

01:05:52.742 --> 01:05:56.982
Indeed, my Bey.
He's stopped them in their tracks.

01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:25.502
The gear has fallen off.

01:06:27.542 --> 01:06:28.462
We'll have to find it.

01:06:30.342 --> 01:06:31.422
Soldiers!

01:06:33.062 --> 01:06:35.982
Be careful. Guard both sides of the road.

01:06:36.302 --> 01:06:38.542
You go that way and you over there, go!

01:06:40.382 --> 01:06:42.542
Everyone else look for the gear. Go!

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:00.462
Do we attack, my Bey?

01:07:01.422 --> 01:07:02.422
Wait.

01:07:03.862 --> 01:07:05.382
Let's see what happens, Bamsi.

01:07:18.542 --> 01:07:21.702
This Atsiz is a smart man, my Bey.

01:07:23.702 --> 01:07:26.422
If we proceed carefully
we can finish this, Bamsi.

01:07:28.222 --> 01:07:32.702
Put on the Byzantine uniforms we brought
and make your way into their camp.

01:07:33.222 --> 01:07:37.062
You'll attack from within,
we'll attack from without.

01:07:37.942 --> 01:07:38.942
Got it, my Bey.

01:07:39.502 --> 01:07:43.262
We hawks will attack this
flock of birds in unison.

01:07:48.062 --> 01:07:51.302
Go now, Bamsi. God help you.

01:07:52.142 --> 01:07:54.862
Amen, my Bey. Let's go.

01:09:52.942 --> 01:09:57.262
I frequently travel by carriage.
I've never seen such a thing.

01:09:59.102 --> 01:10:02.302
No one could be in any doubt we're
approaching the cursed Turkish lands.

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:05.182
Let's put the wheel back on.

01:10:17.342 --> 01:10:19.062
We're not going anywhere
without that gear.

01:10:48.822 --> 01:10:49.942
Be on your guard!

01:10:59.142 --> 01:11:01.022
That's Kostas,
one of Ares' commanders, my Bey.

01:11:01.302 --> 01:11:02.302
At ease.

01:11:02.942 --> 01:11:07.422
-What's he doing here?
-Ares is obviously looking for a new ally

01:11:07.622 --> 01:11:09.822
to replace Emir Sadettin.

01:11:19.662 --> 01:11:20.742
Something wrong, commander?

01:11:21.822 --> 01:11:22.982
Lost your way?

01:11:23.142 --> 01:11:25.822
I thought I might have,
Bahadir Bey, but...

01:11:26.342 --> 01:11:29.142
now that I've seen you,
I know we're on the right path.

01:11:37.342 --> 01:11:40.422
I'm sorry for what was done to you.

01:11:41.102 --> 01:11:44.502
If it hadn't been for Governor Ares,
Ertuğrul would have had your head.

01:11:45.622 --> 01:11:49.382
Governor Ares told Ertuğrul,
where to find the antidote

01:11:50.262 --> 01:11:52.342
for Turgut Alp and Aslıhan Hatun.

01:11:59.822 --> 01:12:04.862
Thanks to Governor Ares,
Ertuğrul realized you were innocent.

01:12:07.662 --> 01:12:11.622
So are you saying
I owe my life to Ares, commander?

01:12:13.782 --> 01:12:14.782
Tell me.

01:12:15.262 --> 01:12:19.182
Should I consider myself
indebted to him, commander?

01:12:20.942 --> 01:12:22.462
You already know that

01:12:22.982 --> 01:12:26.942
Ertuğrul is a threat
to commerce and to peace.

01:12:27.382 --> 01:12:30.422
So? Say it already.

01:12:30.862 --> 01:12:33.302
If you have something to say,
say it like a man!

01:12:36.022 --> 01:12:38.702
We wish to live in peace
with the Turks here .

01:12:38.822 --> 01:12:41.262
and protect our mutual interests.

01:12:41.382 --> 01:12:44.902
But Ertuğrul Bey makes this impossible.

01:12:49.142 --> 01:12:51.422
He's the margrave of these lands.

01:12:52.382 --> 01:12:56.742
If you have a problem,
I suggest you take it up with him.

01:12:57.902 --> 01:12:59.702
Being the margrave means nothing.

01:13:00.302 --> 01:13:04.302
He who cooperates
with Governor Ares, wins.

01:13:05.462 --> 01:13:09.062
We don't want Ertuğrul Bey to win,
we want you to win.

01:13:12.982 --> 01:13:17.542
Well... so...
what do you want from me?

01:13:18.942 --> 01:13:21.222
Commander Ares invites you
to dine with him.

01:13:22.262 --> 01:13:26.622
He wants to discuss matters
of trade and cooperation with you.

01:13:30.222 --> 01:13:32.702
I'd like that too.

01:13:33.262 --> 01:13:39.222
But if Ares wants to talk to me,
he should come to my tent as my guest.

01:13:40.262 --> 01:13:45.222
When he's ready, have him send
a messenger and I'll invite him.

01:13:46.862 --> 01:13:50.342
Now return to your master...
and tell him what I said.

01:13:54.502 --> 01:13:56.942
Alps... Let's go.

01:16:30.102 --> 01:16:31.182
<i>Bismillah.</i>

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:17.142
Spread out, all sides of the camp.

01:17:19.262 --> 01:17:20.502
Guard your positions.

01:17:21.902 --> 01:17:25.782
Destroy them as soon
as we get the signal.

01:19:38.302 --> 01:19:39.462
<i>Well done, kid.</i>

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:56.182
We'll enjoy many great victories
soon, Marya.

01:19:58.262 --> 01:20:00.982
I'd like to celebrate it
with a child of our own.

01:20:10.622 --> 01:20:11.942
A child?

01:20:12.302 --> 01:20:14.342
Yes, our child.

01:20:16.862 --> 01:20:18.342
I grew up alone, Marya.

01:20:19.662 --> 01:20:21.022
I'd like to have a family.

01:20:22.462 --> 01:20:25.582
And you're worthy
of being the mother of my child.

01:20:31.142 --> 01:20:32.742
I like children too.

01:20:33.622 --> 01:20:35.862
I raised my younger brother.

01:20:37.062 --> 01:20:40.062
I'm grateful
that you believe I am worthy of this.

01:20:45.342 --> 01:20:48.462
Sir, a pigeon has come with a message.

01:20:56.382 --> 01:20:59.822
<i>Ertuğrul knows everything.</i>
<i>He'll attack the castle tonight.</i>

01:21:00.342 --> 01:21:03.022
<i>I'll bring his son Gündüz</i>
<i>to you today, as agreed.</i>

01:21:04.742 --> 01:21:05.742
<i>Titan.</i>

01:21:06.702 --> 01:21:10.622
I saved your chief alp and best friend,
and still you will not stop!

01:21:15.702 --> 01:21:18.582
You won't dare do anything
if your son is in my hands, Ertuğrul.

01:21:22.582 --> 01:21:23.862
Is everything all right?

01:21:24.742 --> 01:21:29.262
You just said that you liked children
and that you looked after your brother.

01:21:31.222 --> 01:21:34.982
Today, for our empire,
I'll give you a son.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:40.022
We'll make a Turk-blooded knight
out of him...

01:21:41.142 --> 01:21:42.782
and you'll be his mother.

01:22:05.089 --> 01:22:09.929
<i>I'll give you good news, madam</i>

01:22:12.249 --> 01:22:16.209
<i>May your mountains</i>

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:19.369
<i>Stand tall</i>

01:22:20.729 --> 01:22:25.049
<i>Your tree that has a shadow</i>

01:22:25.489 --> 01:22:27.969
<i>Should not be cut down</i>

01:22:29.489 --> 01:22:33.729
<i>May your water that flows like blood</i>

01:22:34.689 --> 01:22:37.569
<i>Never dry out</i>

01:22:39.809 --> 01:22:43.289
<i>May your wings</i>

01:22:43.849 --> 01:22:46.529
<i>Never fall apart</i>

01:22:47.969 --> 01:22:51.649
<i>May your white horse never stumble</i>

01:22:52.609 --> 01:22:56.129
<i>When it's galloping</i>

01:23:02.169 --> 01:23:03.529
He's finally asleep!

01:23:04.449 --> 01:23:08.849
Savcı will be just like Gündüz.
That boy just won't stop!

01:23:09.209 --> 01:23:10.289
Praise be.

01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:14.769
You should have seen Ertuğrul.
He gave us such a hard time!

01:23:26.329 --> 01:23:27.329
Alçiçek?

01:23:30.249 --> 01:23:31.369
Where is Gündüz?

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.609
He said he was sleepy, Halime Sultan.

01:23:41.849 --> 01:23:43.849
He's taken off his alp clothes.

01:23:50.529 --> 01:23:54.809
He never takes those off.
Where is the boy?

01:23:58.209 --> 01:23:59.529
His cap is here too.

01:24:02.409 --> 01:24:05.209
No, Mother. That's not a good sign.

01:24:05.489 --> 01:24:08.849
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go
look for Gündüz, or I won't feel at ease.

01:24:09.009 --> 01:24:11.529
Wait, don't start worrying.

01:24:12.969 --> 01:24:15.569
You go, I'll look after Savcı.

01:24:16.529 --> 01:24:18.489
Who knows what kind
of mischief he's up to.

01:24:19.729 --> 01:24:22.329
-I'll come with you, Halime Sultan.
-Alçiçek.

01:24:22.529 --> 01:24:26.449
Check around the well.
I'll check the training ground.

01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:28.769
-Of course, Halime Sultan.
-Hafsa, come on.

01:24:29.849 --> 01:24:31.569
My dear God.

01:24:49.009 --> 01:24:50.809
Aren't you done with the wheel yet?

01:24:58.289 --> 01:24:59.569
I'm talking to you!

01:25:01.449 --> 01:25:02.449
Nearly done.

01:25:07.169 --> 01:25:08.009
Who are you?

01:25:13.889 --> 01:25:17.889
So you'll bring up as your own
the son of a great Turk like Ertuğrul.

01:25:20.009 --> 01:25:24.929
You really are a commander
who deserves to be a holy knight.

01:25:34.769 --> 01:25:36.169
Excuse us for a moment, Marya.

01:25:49.409 --> 01:25:51.089
Is what I just heard true, sir?

01:25:52.329 --> 01:25:54.729
He wouldn't dare attack my castle
when I have his son.

01:25:56.129 --> 01:25:58.969
If he does, he'll pay for it
with the life of his son.

01:26:00.529 --> 01:26:02.409
Tell me, did you speak with Bahadir?

01:26:02.929 --> 01:26:07.009
Bahadir Bey said he will host
you in his tent when the time comes.

01:26:08.289 --> 01:26:09.449
In his own tent?

01:26:12.249 --> 01:26:13.769
Do you know what that means, Kostas?

01:26:16.169 --> 01:26:18.729
Bahadir is planning to raid Aslıhan's tent
and take over her tribe.

01:26:19.529 --> 01:26:21.489
How will he do that
while Ertuğrul is around, sir?

01:26:22.089 --> 01:26:26.049
They'll suck each other's blood, Kostas.
Isn't that enough?

01:26:31.209 --> 01:26:34.129
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Show me your face.

01:26:40.009 --> 01:26:40.849
I'm your death!

01:26:42.609 --> 01:26:44.169
-Damn it.
-Arrows!

01:26:44.409 --> 01:26:47.289
God is the greatest!
God is the greatest!

01:26:52.449 --> 01:26:53.489
God is one.

01:27:03.369 --> 01:27:05.369
Come on, my lions! Come on!

01:27:05.809 --> 01:27:08.689
Finish off those heathens
with your swords. It's time for a battle.

01:27:09.089 --> 01:27:12.129
Your swords won't go back into their
sheaths without blood on them!

01:27:12.409 --> 01:27:14.849
God is the greatest!

01:27:17.289 --> 01:27:18.649
God is one!

01:27:59.129 --> 01:28:00.329
My God, my God.

01:28:00.849 --> 01:28:02.969
He's nowhere to be seen. Where can he be?

01:28:03.289 --> 01:28:06.089
We'll find him, Halime Hatun.
Try to calm down.

01:28:07.249 --> 01:28:10.089
Hafsa, he never stops.
Don't you know that?

01:28:10.569 --> 01:28:12.089
Who knows where could have got to.

01:28:16.929 --> 01:28:18.329
-We'll find him--
-Alçiçek!

01:28:24.929 --> 01:28:26.169
He's not here, Halime Hatun.

01:28:26.729 --> 01:28:29.849
We went all the way down to the well.
We looked everywhere.

01:28:30.609 --> 01:28:32.169
All the way to the gate.

01:28:32.929 --> 01:28:36.289
He's gone. God forbid,
I even looked in the well.

01:28:37.649 --> 01:28:39.049
He's not at the training ground.

01:28:40.089 --> 01:28:41.769
I have this fear in me, Hafsa.

01:28:42.729 --> 01:28:45.569
Let's tell the guards.
Get them to look for him.

01:28:45.849 --> 01:28:47.809
He's a child, he'll be hiding somewhere.

01:28:48.369 --> 01:28:52.849
Alçiçek, let the guards know
they must look for Gündüz.

01:28:53.209 --> 01:28:56.529
This doesn't bode well.
Let my mother and Artuk Bey know.

01:28:57.049 --> 01:29:00.809
Hafsa, let's check the back
of the training ground. Come on.

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:24.329
-What happened? Did you find him?
-He's nowhere to be found, Mother Hayme.

01:29:25.569 --> 01:29:28.089
Halime Hatun and the alps
are looking for him.

01:29:32.289 --> 01:29:33.889
I can't just sit here.

01:29:34.809 --> 01:29:36.089
I'll go look for him too.

01:29:36.809 --> 01:29:40.009
-Don't leave Savcı's side.
-Yes, Mother Hayme.

01:29:49.209 --> 01:29:50.769
Where are you, flying horse?

01:30:31.849 --> 01:30:34.449
Gündüz Alp? What are you doing here?

01:30:35.089 --> 01:30:36.649
What are you doing here?

01:30:37.409 --> 01:30:39.649
You should go, you can't be here.

01:30:39.849 --> 01:30:42.329
I can't leave you here.
You're away from the tribe.

01:30:42.929 --> 01:30:46.089
No, you should go.
I'm looking for the flying horse.

01:30:46.609 --> 01:30:48.289
What do you mean, Gündüz?
A flying horse?

01:30:51.969 --> 01:30:52.929
Darius!

01:30:57.809 --> 01:30:58.929
What are you doing here?

01:31:03.489 --> 01:31:07.369
Tell him to go away so that I
can see the flying horse, Darius.

01:31:12.529 --> 01:31:14.409
Gündüz. Run home.

01:31:15.049 --> 01:31:16.489
Why are you saying that?

01:31:16.769 --> 01:31:20.009
Just do what I tell you, Gündüz.
Gündüz, run home!

01:31:21.689 --> 01:31:24.729
You scoundrel.
So you're biting the hand that feeds you?

01:31:39.209 --> 01:31:40.209
Murderer.

01:31:42.249 --> 01:31:43.249
Gündüz!

01:31:46.849 --> 01:31:48.089
Gündüz!

01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:50.969
I'm here, Samsa Alp, I'm here!

01:31:54.529 --> 01:31:56.289
Gündüz!

01:32:14.649 --> 01:32:15.649
Gündüz!

01:32:19.569 --> 01:32:20.569
Gündüz!

01:32:25.409 --> 01:32:26.529
Gündüz!

01:32:40.929 --> 01:32:41.929
Brother!

01:33:42.809 --> 01:33:44.369
Brother? Brother!

01:33:44.449 --> 01:33:48.249
What happened to you?
Who did this to you? Tell me.

01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:59.569
My God.

01:34:00.409 --> 01:34:03.329
Samsa! What's going on here?

01:34:03.649 --> 01:34:06.409
I don't know, Halime Sultan.
I found our alp here, wounded.

01:34:12.009 --> 01:34:15.009
Alp, what happened? Who did this to you?

01:34:16.289 --> 01:34:18.969
-Darius.
-Darius?

01:34:39.489 --> 01:34:40.689
Gündüz.

01:34:41.849 --> 01:34:43.969
Darius took Gündüz.

01:34:44.969 --> 01:34:46.729
What do you mean he took Gündüz?

01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:51.689
Gündüz!

01:34:52.369 --> 01:34:54.609
-Gündüz!
-Halime Hatun.

01:34:56.769 --> 01:34:58.289
What are we going to do now?

01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:49.249
You couldn't escape us even if you
hid in the seventh layer of Hell.

01:36:49.809 --> 01:36:52.369
You... Who are you?

01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:54.809
Son of Suleyman Shah, Ertuğrul.

01:36:56.969 --> 01:36:58.249
Ertuğrul?

01:37:01.449 --> 01:37:06.769
You... So you were on his side all along?
How did I miss that?

01:37:07.329 --> 01:37:09.649
Your mind isn't capable of
comprehending our strength.

01:37:10.649 --> 01:37:13.529
Don't exhaust yourself.
You've got a great deal to tell us.

01:37:14.689 --> 01:37:16.049
What will we do with him, my Bey?

01:37:23.609 --> 01:37:25.529
We'll question him first, Bamsi.

01:37:27.209 --> 01:37:30.969
We'll raid the castle tonight.
Let's find a cave to hide in for now.

01:37:33.729 --> 01:37:35.089
We'll question him there.

01:37:37.209 --> 01:37:40.089
Collect the clothes that are
in good condition from the dead soldiers.

01:37:42.449 --> 01:37:44.889
-Take this degenerate.
-As you command, my Bey.

01:38:01.969 --> 01:38:04.289
Halime Sultan, it's too dangerous here.

01:38:04.889 --> 01:38:07.569
-You should go back.
-What are you talking about, Samsa?

01:38:08.369 --> 01:38:10.249
How can I go back
before we've found Gündüz?

01:38:12.089 --> 01:38:15.009
Alps! Alps!
Go back right away.

01:38:15.489 --> 01:38:18.129
Gündüz has been abducted. It was Darius.

01:38:23.969 --> 01:38:27.289
They've taken my son.
They've taken my Gündüz!

01:38:27.529 --> 01:38:30.409
Halime Hatun, we'll find him. We will.

01:38:31.089 --> 01:38:34.329
I'm not going anywhere
until I find him. Alps!

01:38:34.609 --> 01:38:37.289
-With me!
-Come on.

01:38:40.969 --> 01:38:42.209
Gündüz!

01:39:44.969 --> 01:39:47.689
Where's the loyal servant
of Governor Ares going?

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:50.369
Let me go! Let me go!

01:39:51.529 --> 01:39:54.569
It's not that easy.
You've to become a great knight first.

01:39:55.049 --> 01:39:57.129
Let me go. Let me go!

01:40:01.009 --> 01:40:02.689
But we have to train you first.

01:40:03.129 --> 01:40:04.129
Let me go.

01:40:04.489 --> 01:40:07.449
My father will destroy you and Ares.
Let me go!

01:40:07.929 --> 01:40:09.809
First, he'll have to save you from me.

01:40:40.209 --> 01:40:45.249
Murderer. You killed our alp.
My father will catch you.

01:40:51.289 --> 01:40:52.289
Let go of me!

01:41:01.329 --> 01:41:02.329
Let me go.

01:41:04.769 --> 01:41:06.969
-Let me go.
-Get inside.

01:41:10.089 --> 01:41:11.289
Let me go.

01:41:16.809 --> 01:41:18.289
Halime!

01:41:24.529 --> 01:41:25.889
Halime!

01:41:28.569 --> 01:41:29.889
Gündüz!

01:41:31.049 --> 01:41:33.249
-Halime!
-Mother!

01:41:37.929 --> 01:41:39.649
They've taken my Gündüz, Mother.

01:41:42.969 --> 01:41:46.049
-They've abducted my Gündüz.
-I know. I know.

01:41:46.569 --> 01:41:47.889
Don't worry, we'll find him.

01:41:48.369 --> 01:41:51.289
Our Alps have the place surrounded.
They have nowhere to hide.

01:41:51.489 --> 01:41:52.729
-We'll find him.
-We'll find him.

01:41:52.929 --> 01:41:54.009
-I hope so.
-We will.

01:41:55.849 --> 01:41:57.009
Gündüz!

01:41:57.689 --> 01:41:58.729
Gündüz!

01:42:02.609 --> 01:42:03.609
Artuk Bey.

01:42:05.609 --> 01:42:06.609
Artuk Bey.

01:42:13.169 --> 01:42:16.169
Artuk Bey, that devil
Darius has taken Gündüz.

01:42:16.409 --> 01:42:17.689
Is there any trace of him?

01:42:18.129 --> 01:42:21.689
He's already escaped, Halime Sultan.
But he left his horse.

01:42:22.769 --> 01:42:25.969
-So he can't go far.
-He can't, Hayme Hatun.

01:42:26.369 --> 01:42:30.649
All right. Why do you think he
has taken my Gündüz, Artuk Bey?

01:42:31.449 --> 01:42:35.129
In my opinion, Governor Ares
has something to do with this.

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:37.129
He ordered him to kidnap Gündüz.

01:42:39.689 --> 01:42:42.169
There will be no peace for any of us
until that degenerate dies.

01:42:42.609 --> 01:42:44.369
I'm not going back until I find my son.

01:42:45.049 --> 01:42:46.569
No one's going back.

01:42:47.569 --> 01:42:48.569
Yağız Alp!

01:42:51.289 --> 01:42:54.529
Find Ertuğrul Bey quickly.
Tell him what's happened.

01:42:54.929 --> 01:42:56.009
Right away, Artuk Bey.

01:42:58.249 --> 01:43:02.289
-We'll keep searching. Alps!
-Come on, Alps!

01:43:07.289 --> 01:43:08.289
Alps!

01:43:08.489 --> 01:43:10.849
-Come on, Alps!
-Gündüz!

01:43:25.729 --> 01:43:26.889
May I enter, Bey?

01:43:34.249 --> 01:43:35.249
Come in, Oğuz.

01:43:37.969 --> 01:43:39.689
You asked for me, Chief Alp Turgut.

01:43:41.809 --> 01:43:44.969
From now on, you'll stay
at my side in Cavdar tribe.

01:43:45.529 --> 01:43:46.969
As you command, Chief Alp Turgut.

01:43:52.369 --> 01:43:53.929
Now, I have a mission for you.

01:43:55.449 --> 01:44:00.929
I sent Kırca Alp after Bahadir. However,
I haven't heard from him for some time.

01:44:02.049 --> 01:44:04.689
-Look everywhere for him.
-As you command.

01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:27.649
We've hunted and trained,
just as you ordered.

01:44:28.089 --> 01:44:29.969
We've sharpened our swords with our anger.

01:44:30.809 --> 01:44:33.449
We're all waiting to hear your orders
so that we may obey them.

01:44:37.209 --> 01:44:38.529
My brave Alps!

01:44:40.129 --> 01:44:46.529
We have piled up heads
upon heads in so many battles.

01:44:47.049 --> 01:44:50.729
No army can stand in our way.

01:44:52.009 --> 01:44:55.529
And now... a few scoundrels...

01:44:56.569 --> 01:44:59.729
aim to take our rights away from us.

01:45:00.849 --> 01:45:05.329
They think we're weak
and won't put up a fight.

01:45:05.769 --> 01:45:09.609
Will we let these fools
get the better of us?

01:45:09.769 --> 01:45:10.889
We won't!

01:45:12.929 --> 01:45:15.889
No one can run us down.

01:45:18.409 --> 01:45:22.049
Now... it's time to

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:26.649
gut our enemies and have
their blood flow as rivers.

01:45:27.849 --> 01:45:31.209
We'll ride into that tribe
with our swords unsheathed

01:45:31.729 --> 01:45:34.969
and take back with blood what is ours.

01:45:35.449 --> 01:45:36.969
We'll take it with blood!

01:45:37.049 --> 01:45:39.689
-With blood!
-With blood!

01:45:39.809 --> 01:45:42.369
-With blood!
-With blood!

01:45:45.769 --> 01:45:47.169
So you were following us?

01:45:53.609 --> 01:45:54.649
Kırca is escaping!

01:45:55.369 --> 01:45:56.369
Get him!

01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:57.849
Go after him!

01:46:37.609 --> 01:46:38.569
Gündüz!

01:46:38.689 --> 01:46:40.009
-Gündüz!
-My Gündüz Bey!

01:46:41.449 --> 01:46:42.449
Gündüz!

01:46:43.049 --> 01:46:44.929
-My Gündüz Bey!
-Gündüz!

01:46:45.849 --> 01:46:47.929
-My Gündüz Bey!
-Gündüz!

01:46:48.889 --> 01:46:51.369
-Gündüz.
-My Gündüz Bey.

01:46:52.929 --> 01:46:54.409
-Gündüz!
-My Gündüz Bey!

01:46:54.889 --> 01:46:56.129
-My Gündüz Bey!
-Gündüz!

01:46:56.289 --> 01:46:58.249
-Gündüz!
-Gündüz!

01:46:58.969 --> 01:47:01.569
-Gündüz!
-My Gündüz Bey!

01:47:04.929 --> 01:47:06.569
-My Gündüz Bey!
-Gündüz!

01:47:09.129 --> 01:47:11.249
-Gündüz!
-My Gündüz Bey!

01:47:15.329 --> 01:47:16.329
My Bey.

01:47:18.929 --> 01:47:20.649
-Bey, we found something.
-What is it?

01:47:20.849 --> 01:47:22.729
-Tell me.
-Follow me.

01:47:23.849 --> 01:47:24.849
Good.

01:47:26.769 --> 01:47:27.889
Come on, hurry.

01:47:45.329 --> 01:47:46.489
Do you know who I am?

01:47:48.649 --> 01:47:51.129
The emperor will have his revenge.

01:47:51.849 --> 01:47:53.889
You'll pay a heavy price
for what you've done.

01:48:00.689 --> 01:48:02.849
Your emperor sent
a lot of men to fight me.

01:48:04.609 --> 01:48:05.929
I killed every one of them.

01:48:07.209 --> 01:48:08.409
You think he'll save you?

01:48:10.969 --> 01:48:12.409
Now answer my question.

01:48:13.889 --> 01:48:15.809
Will other armies come?

01:48:19.649 --> 01:48:24.089
Bigger armies will come.
Greater than you could ever imagine.

01:48:25.369 --> 01:48:26.969
You'll be destroyed.

01:48:27.849 --> 01:48:29.929
Our vengeance will follow you
wherever you go.

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:43.649
All the armies...

01:48:45.209 --> 01:48:47.409
in the world could come after us.

01:48:49.489 --> 01:48:51.769
To fight the Turks on the steppe...

01:48:52.569 --> 01:48:56.569
is nothing like playing games
behind castle walls.

01:49:00.529 --> 01:49:04.929
We turned these lands
into our home with our blood.

01:49:06.449 --> 01:49:08.169
We're here until doomsday.

01:49:20.169 --> 01:49:22.769
What did you gain by killing
those soldiers and capturing me?

01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:25.169
What do you think you can do?

01:49:27.689 --> 01:49:32.089
Your emperor sent those soldiers
to Karacahisar to fight us.

01:49:34.769 --> 01:49:39.569
We will enter Karacahisar
disguised as those soldiers.

01:49:46.689 --> 01:49:50.329
You won't be able to. You can't.

01:49:52.929 --> 01:49:53.929
Tomorrow...

01:49:54.849 --> 01:49:57.849
when I get the head of that traitor Ares,

01:49:58.609 --> 01:50:00.849
everyone will see if I can or not.

01:50:03.609 --> 01:50:04.969
You'll take that head...

01:50:07.329 --> 01:50:09.329
and tell all of Nicaea of my victory.

01:50:33.129 --> 01:50:35.529
My Bey! Bey, he's here!

01:50:43.569 --> 01:50:44.569
Stop.

01:51:22.889 --> 01:51:26.969
The dog of Aslıhan... and Turgut Alp.

01:51:30.569 --> 01:51:33.609
Your owner sent you after us.

01:51:34.609 --> 01:51:37.209
And you were going to report back to him?

01:51:38.569 --> 01:51:41.289
Do whatever you want.
I'm not scared of you.

01:51:46.169 --> 01:51:50.609
They say there's no
point in fearing your own death, Kırca.

01:51:55.169 --> 01:51:58.489
Don't worry. We'll take over the tribe.

01:52:00.169 --> 01:52:01.169
Maybe,

01:52:01.529 --> 01:52:06.009
your Hatun and your commander
will come after you.

01:52:11.849 --> 01:52:15.129
You think you can take the tribe where
Ertuğrul humiliated you and had you kneel?

01:52:15.929 --> 01:52:17.489
You can't do anything.

01:52:18.209 --> 01:52:21.969
My Ertuğrul Bey and Turgut Alp
will avenge my death.

01:52:22.769 --> 01:52:24.729
They'll humiliate you
and make you kneel again.

01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:28.049
This time you won't be
able to save yourself

01:52:28.409 --> 01:52:29.649
from Ertuğrul Bey's sword.

01:52:47.569 --> 01:52:50.649
Shall we ride into the tribe
carrying this dog's head, Father?

01:52:52.489 --> 01:52:55.649
When there are more
important heads for us to take,

01:52:56.649 --> 01:52:58.689
there's no point taking this one.

01:53:02.009 --> 01:53:05.529
Now... it's time to take back our tribe.

01:53:06.329 --> 01:53:08.129
Wait for my word.

01:53:41.649 --> 01:53:43.169
These are the tracks we found, my Bey.

01:54:03.049 --> 01:54:05.169
They lead up to that cave.

01:54:06.369 --> 01:54:08.569
I hope they're there.

01:54:09.009 --> 01:54:12.169
Let's be quick, Artuk Bey.
There's no point in waiting, come on.

01:54:12.289 --> 01:54:14.369
-My God.
-In the name of God. Come on.

01:54:14.729 --> 01:54:16.489
-Gündüz!
-Gündüz!

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:18.689
-Gündüz!
-Gündüz!

01:54:21.449 --> 01:54:22.689
Gündüz!

01:54:30.369 --> 01:54:32.969
Why does the sultan
want to talk to me, Göktuğ?

01:54:33.809 --> 01:54:35.289
I don't know, Eminence.

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:37.649
His servant will come and tell us.

01:54:39.569 --> 01:54:41.329
He must have found out.

01:54:44.609 --> 01:54:46.729
If Ertuğrul found out about priest's cave,

01:54:48.729 --> 01:54:51.929
he'll suspect you were responsible for
what happened to Turgut Alp and Aslıhan.

01:54:54.649 --> 01:54:55.649
Worse than that,

01:54:56.009 --> 01:54:59.849
they'll hold me responsible for
our sultan being poisoned.

01:55:03.049 --> 01:55:04.049
Eminence,

01:55:05.049 --> 01:55:08.769
we have to prevent Ertuğrul getting a
message to the sultan with his suspicions.

01:55:11.649 --> 01:55:13.809
Ertuğrul is not so stupid that he would

01:55:14.609 --> 01:55:17.449
communicate such a sensitive matter
to the sultan by writing to him.

01:55:19.209 --> 01:55:22.289
He'll want to tell the sultan about
his suspicions face to face.

01:55:31.329 --> 01:55:34.209
Eminence. Our Sultan is waiting for you.

01:56:07.089 --> 01:56:09.169
I have received information
from my scouts, Sadettin.

01:56:09.809 --> 01:56:10.809
What's wrong, my Sultan?

01:56:12.289 --> 01:56:16.489
An attempt was made to poison
Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut Alp.

01:56:17.609 --> 01:56:18.609
How dare they?

01:56:18.689 --> 01:56:21.049
What is the motive for
such a despicable act?

01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:26.009
Maybe to weaken a margrave

01:56:26.969 --> 01:56:30.089
as strong and brave as Ertuğrul,
my Sultan.

01:56:36.409 --> 01:56:39.249
My Sultan, the news you have received

01:56:39.689 --> 01:56:43.009
and the evidence I have collected
match perfectly.

01:56:44.569 --> 01:56:46.249
Which evidence, Sadettin?

01:56:49.049 --> 01:56:50.409
I have no doubt

01:56:51.449 --> 01:56:57.209
that the traitors who cooperated
with the emperor are in Konya.

01:56:58.769 --> 01:56:59.769
Don't you dare

01:57:00.769 --> 01:57:03.849
cast aspersions upon the people
I have in my palace, Sadettin.

01:57:05.729 --> 01:57:07.769
I will not tolerate such behavior!

01:57:09.129 --> 01:57:12.009
I know who it was
the traitors cooperated with

01:57:12.169 --> 01:57:16.089
to poison you and trap Ertuğrul Bey.

01:57:17.889 --> 01:57:19.769
I have their names.

01:57:34.729 --> 01:57:38.289
Kırca hasn't returned.
Where could he be?

01:57:43.769 --> 01:57:46.889
It's not a good sign that
he's failed to come back.

01:57:48.609 --> 01:57:50.249
I've sent Oğuz Alp after him.

01:57:52.689 --> 01:57:55.809
-Do you think something's happened to him?
-That's what I'm afraid of.

01:57:56.449 --> 01:57:58.729
That demon Bahadir is capable of anything.

01:57:59.449 --> 01:58:04.409
He's breathing fire, he wants blood.
There's nothing he won't do.

01:58:08.209 --> 01:58:10.689
<i>-Can I come in, Turgut Alp?</i>
-Come in.

01:58:15.849 --> 01:58:19.209
Turgut Alp, I looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find Kırca Alp.

01:58:19.529 --> 01:58:20.609
No one has seen him.

01:58:23.369 --> 01:58:24.489
How's that possible?

01:58:37.449 --> 01:58:38.449
Aslıhan.

01:58:39.329 --> 01:58:43.169
I can't just sit here doing nothing.
Something's wrong.

01:58:46.529 --> 01:58:48.049
I'd better go look for him.

01:58:52.089 --> 01:58:54.849
Turgut, wait.
Where do you think you're going?

01:58:55.209 --> 01:58:57.569
You haven't recovered yet.
You have to rest.

01:58:58.689 --> 01:59:00.009
Let's send the alps.

01:59:03.289 --> 01:59:07.289
I can't sit and hide in our tent, Aslıhan.
I have to lead my men.

01:59:10.049 --> 01:59:11.049
Turgut.

01:59:13.969 --> 01:59:14.969
Please don't go.

01:59:23.849 --> 01:59:24.849
Don't worry.

01:59:26.849 --> 01:59:27.849
I'll come back to you.

01:59:38.009 --> 01:59:40.769
My God, may you protect him.

01:59:49.209 --> 01:59:50.209
Who?

01:59:51.609 --> 01:59:52.609
Ekaterina.

01:59:53.969 --> 01:59:55.969
-Wife of Ural Bey?
-Yes.

01:59:58.209 --> 01:59:59.209
She was the one

01:59:59.729 --> 02:00:03.409
who provided the connection
between Nicaea and your palace.

02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:09.969
What's your evidence, Sadettin?

02:00:11.569 --> 02:00:13.209
A priest who abandoned his religion.

02:00:15.129 --> 02:00:17.209
We know he's a skilled herbalist.

02:00:18.129 --> 02:00:22.929
I've been told by reliable witnesses
that he was known to Ekaterina.

02:00:24.449 --> 02:00:27.249
Ekaterina was the one
who asked for the poison.

02:00:29.529 --> 02:00:33.969
They heard from the traitors in your
palace that you were at Hanlı bazaar.

02:00:34.449 --> 02:00:35.729
But it wasn't enough for them.

02:00:36.209 --> 02:00:39.449
They laid a trap for Ertuğrul Bey.

02:00:39.809 --> 02:00:42.689
Where is this Hatun?
Find her and bring her to me immediately.

02:00:45.529 --> 02:00:49.049
Unfortunately, I've just heard
that she's been killed.

02:00:52.489 --> 02:00:56.089
The traitors killed her
when they realized they'd failed.

02:00:57.529 --> 02:01:02.089
They then turned their deadly sights
on Aslıhan Hatun.

02:01:07.489 --> 02:01:08.849
If you'll let me

02:01:09.769 --> 02:01:12.369
I'd like to track down
the traitors in your palace.

02:01:14.969 --> 02:01:19.529
I'll have this matter resolved
within the time I promised you.

02:01:22.729 --> 02:01:26.289
Otherwise, living would be a sin for me.

02:01:30.649 --> 02:01:31.729
Gündüz!

02:01:32.969 --> 02:01:33.969
-Gündüz!
-Gündüz!

02:01:34.649 --> 02:01:35.969
-Gündüz!
-Gündüz!

02:01:54.449 --> 02:01:56.129
Does this belong to Gündüz, Halime Sultan?

02:02:00.489 --> 02:02:01.489
My son.

02:02:04.529 --> 02:02:05.529
My Gündüz.

02:02:09.249 --> 02:02:10.489
It's his, Artuk Bey.

02:02:11.009 --> 02:02:13.129
That dog was using
this place as his hideout.

02:02:14.329 --> 02:02:15.329
My God.

02:02:15.849 --> 02:02:18.369
Please don't let us go through
the pain of losing a child.

02:02:27.129 --> 02:02:29.009
I'll kill him with my own hands.

02:02:29.809 --> 02:02:32.169
-Halime Hatun, please stop.
-Move, Hafsa! Move!

02:02:32.249 --> 02:02:33.249
Halime!

02:02:34.449 --> 02:02:35.609
Pull yourself together.

02:02:36.249 --> 02:02:38.369
I won't let him take
my son from me, Mother.

02:02:38.529 --> 02:02:40.249
-Get out of my way.
-Halime!

02:02:40.329 --> 02:02:41.849
-Let go of me!
-Halime!

02:02:42.969 --> 02:02:44.049
Look at me.

02:02:45.929 --> 02:02:48.569
We'll find him. We'll find him.

02:02:49.249 --> 02:02:50.369
Calm yourself.

02:02:51.049 --> 02:02:53.129
Artuk Bey will let Ertuğrul know.

02:02:55.609 --> 02:02:57.009
Now, let's go back to the tribe.

02:02:58.329 --> 02:03:00.849
Ertuğrul will find him
and bring him back to us.

02:03:09.049 --> 02:03:12.169
-This is hell.
-It's all right.

02:03:12.889 --> 02:03:15.409
It's all right.
It's all right, daughter.

02:03:17.569 --> 02:03:18.849
{\an8}It's all right, dear.

02:03:28.997 --> 02:03:30.077
Aziz!

02:03:41.797 --> 02:03:45.477
-Yes, my Sultan.
-Ekaterina. And the priest.

02:03:48.237 --> 02:03:49.597
I want to know who they are,

02:03:50.637 --> 02:03:53.317
and what dealings they had
with those who poisoned me.

02:03:54.797 --> 02:03:58.157
Assign your best men
to gather information.

02:03:59.037 --> 02:04:00.197
Yes, my Sultan.

02:04:01.557 --> 02:04:02.917
We're going to the palace.

02:04:04.477 --> 02:04:07.157
The sultan is convinced
the traitors are in the palace.

02:04:09.397 --> 02:04:10.477
The time has come.

02:04:12.717 --> 02:04:14.837
We move soon to kill the sultan.

02:04:16.517 --> 02:04:18.757
You go there first
and let our friends know.

02:04:20.117 --> 02:04:22.117
Tell them I'll be waiting
in the Caravansary.

02:04:22.797 --> 02:04:24.557
We'll throw a grand feast for them.

02:04:25.797 --> 02:04:27.877
What if they don't obey, Eminence?

02:04:28.677 --> 02:04:32.077
Then they will be put to death
for attempting to kill the sultan.

02:04:34.597 --> 02:04:39.437
It's high time they learned
who really represents the state.

02:04:52.917 --> 02:04:54.037
And about Sadettin...

02:04:55.437 --> 02:04:57.917
I want to know which emirs and commanders

02:04:58.717 --> 02:05:02.157
he contacts when he reaches Konya.

02:05:02.917 --> 02:05:04.317
As you command, my Sultan.

02:05:40.077 --> 02:05:41.077
My Bey<i>.</i>

02:05:51.517 --> 02:05:53.957
My Bey<i>, </i>Yağız Alp is here.
He has news from the tribe.

02:05:55.157 --> 02:05:57.797
I hope all is well. Let him come in.

02:06:09.877 --> 02:06:10.877
Well, Yağız Alp?

02:06:12.077 --> 02:06:14.797
Artuk Bey sent me, my Bey. Gündüz...

02:06:17.957 --> 02:06:18.997
What about Gündüz?

02:06:26.757 --> 02:06:30.517
I'm asking you. What about him?

02:06:36.637 --> 02:06:39.637
Gündüz... Gündüz has been
taken from the tribe, my Bey.

02:06:55.357 --> 02:06:58.277
-Who?
-The trader Darius, my Bey.

02:07:37.763 --> 02:07:38.763
Titan.

02:07:40.068 --> 02:07:42.268
So, you've brought Ertuğrul's son to me.

02:08:32.681 --> 02:08:35.121
Welcome to your new home,
my little knight.

02:08:38.881 --> 02:08:41.041
I'll raise you to be a great knight.

02:08:47.361 --> 02:08:50.001
With your courage and your strength,

02:08:53.241 --> 02:08:55.841
you'll become a great
knight of the empire.

02:08:59.561 --> 02:09:01.241
From now on, your name is Kronos.

02:09:24.704 --> 02:09:25.624
Ares!
