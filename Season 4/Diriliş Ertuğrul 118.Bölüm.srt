1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 118 will start after 12:10 min.

2
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,745
My dear son.

3
00:12:43,745 --> 00:12:48,345
Eat your food
and be a glorious alp.

4
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:54,025
Come, Gündüz.

5
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:55,545
Come, sit.

6
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:05,665
Father.

7
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:10,225
Will you take care of us
when Mother is gone?

8
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:16,265
Will you feed Savcı?

9
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:25,225
I will, son.

10
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:28,785
I will.

11
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:37,465
I'll help you, Father.

12
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:42,625
I shall feed both my brothers.

13
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,265
I shall protect them.

14
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:53,505
I'm proud of you.

15
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:01,665
Go on.

16
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:07,225
Father, my brother is full.

17
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:09,345
He is, son.

18
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:11,505
He is.

19
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,185
I'm proud of you.

20
00:14:22,065 --> 00:14:24,065
A brave brother like you,

21
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:27,065
feeds his brother with his own hands.

22
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:29,265
I'm proud of you.

23
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:34,585
And I'm proud of you as well.

24
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:55,465
My Sultan.

25
00:15:56,025 --> 00:16:00,665
It's not good that Ögeday sent Noyan
as a messenger.

26
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:06,305
Their wish is clear,
Hüsamettin Karaca.

27
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:10,585
We already pay our taxes, my Sultan.

28
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:12,545
What else?

29
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:15,265
The Mongols are at the Danube.

30
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:19,505
Desht-i Kipchak and
the Black sea are theirs.

31
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:22,625
They're pressuring us.

32
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,625
That scum is trying to take advantage
of this

33
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:29,985
to try to create chaos in the Seljuk lands
every day.

34
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:34,585
Ögeday will consider all this
and raise his demands.

35
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:41,225
May God protect us from them.

36
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,345
Alps, brothers.

37
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:49,265
Be cautious.

38
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:52,345
These are treacherous times.

39
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,345
We must be ever vigilant.

40
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:32,065
Is this the next problem
the Emperor has for us?

41
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:33,625
We'll see, brother.

42
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:34,985
We'll see.

43
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:40,585
-Be careful, alps.
-As you order.

44
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:41,865
Just in case.

45
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:57,465
I'm the new commander
of Bilecik Castle.

46
00:17:58,185 --> 00:17:59,185
My name is Romanos.

47
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:00,785
Welcome.

48
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:02,585
Welcome.

49
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,065
Thank you.

50
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:07,585
I heard that Ertuğrul Bey lost his wife.

51
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:12,065
I've come to offer condolences
and for peace talks.

52
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,625
Huh.

53
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:16,945
What peace?

54
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:20,145
Our Emperor specifically tasked me
with this.

55
00:18:21,145 --> 00:18:23,425
I wish to see Ertuğrul Bey, if possible.

56
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:27,585
Wait here.

57
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:31,385
I'll tell Ertuğrul Bey.

58
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:52,545
My Sultan,

59
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,705
Noyan asks to see you.

60
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:57,465
Let him in.

61
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:50,745
Do you not know
how to respect a Sultan, Noyan?

62
00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:57,745
I'm the messenger of Ögeday Khan,
the Khan of Khans.

63
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:02,665
If I am to respect someone,

64
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,785
he must be mightier than my Khan.

65
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:16,785
I don't see anyone like that.

66
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:22,425
What does your...

67
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:24,745
Ögeday Khan want?

68
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:26,945
My Khan's demands

69
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:29,105
are in this letter.

70
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:32,505
Let me see.

71
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:47,145
God created you so beautifully.

72
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:50,185
My little lion.

73
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,025
My brave son.

74
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:01,665
<i>Permission to enter, my Bey?</i>

75
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:05,425
Come, Turgut.

76
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:18,265
-Speak.
-My Bey.

77
00:22:19,865 --> 00:22:21,785
A man named Commander Romanos came.

78
00:22:22,185 --> 00:22:23,345
For you.

79
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:27,025
What does he want?

80
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:30,585
To offer his condolences...

81
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,265
and to discuss peace.

82
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:42,265
Wait, son, don't cry.

83
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:44,545
My Osman.

84
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:46,305
Don't cry.

85
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:54,865
Turgut, you and Bamsı speak with him.

86
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:57,945
You'll tell me about it after.

87
00:23:00,065 --> 00:23:01,065
As you order.

88
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:02,825
Excuse me.

89
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:06,065
My son.

90
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:07,945
Look,

91
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:09,905
I'm here, I didn't go.

92
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:14,105
I'm with you.

93
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:15,865
Don't cry, my son.

94
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:17,825
Don't cry.

95
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,610
The tributes your khan demands
would weaken my state.

96
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,570
It wouldn't do you any good,

97
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,850
even if you were strong,
Sultan Giyaseddin.

98
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,970
Power is not important when you are
under Ogedei Khan's rule...

99
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,370
obedience is.

100
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,530
I agree to... Ogedei Khan's request.

101
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,090
I will double the tributes
I have paid up to now.

102
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,570
But of course you will, Sultan Giyaseddin.

103
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,810
The future of your state
and your throne depends on it.

104
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,130
However... I have a request of my own
for your khan.

105
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,450
What is it?

106
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,330
When you ride to deliver my answer
to your khan,

107
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,770
my emissary will accompany you.

108
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,570
There are important matters
I wish to communicate to Ogedei Khan.

109
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,410
I pity that emissary already.

110
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,850
Who will this emissary be?

111
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,250
Ertuğrul Bey.

112
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,210
Ertuğrul?

113
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,570
Husamettin Karaca will give you my decree.

114
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,210
No one will stand in the way
of you leaving.

115
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,530
You may go now.

116
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,850
I would be honored to have
Ertuğrul Bey's company on the journey.

117
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:23,050
But be careful you don't
provoke Ogedei Khan's anger.

118
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,570
It would break my heart if Ogedei got to
take Ertuğrul's head instead of me.

119
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,650
I bring our emperor's greetings
and condolences to Ertuğrul Bey.

120
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,210
He sends his deepest regrets
over the loss of his dear wife.

121
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,410
Thank you, Commander Romanos.

122
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,970
Our emperor also sends this letter
of friendship to Ertuğrul Bey.

123
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,610
We wish to make a strong
and lasting peace with you.

124
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,810
Your emperor has frequently made
promises of peace to our bey and sultan.

125
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:12,170
But... each time he breaks it
with some new act of treachery.

126
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,890
The hand of peace you extend to us
comes dripping with betrayal and blood.

127
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,330
How can you expect us to believe you
after everything that's happened?

128
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,090
The Mongols.

129
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,290
What do the Mongols have to do with peace?

130
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:38,010
The Mongols have taken Crimea.
The Black Sea is now under their rule.

131
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,770
They will soon reach Baghdad.

132
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,290
They will surround Anatolia
on three sides.

133
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,370
Look, it's just you and us out here.

134
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,690
We have to make peace in order to protect
Anatolia from a Mongolian invasion.

135
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,970
We are aware of everything you speak of.

136
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,370
We too are taking precautions as a state.

137
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,170
However, none of that
is enough for us to trust you.

138
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,690
In exchange for peace,

139
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,250
our emperor will not challenge
your right to settle in Söğüt.

140
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,530
You can settle there whenever you want.

141
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,890
Just agree to unite with us
against the Mongols.

142
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,970
Don't try to suggest your emperor
is bestowing anything on us.

143
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,530
Söğüt is ours to take.

144
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,050
It's not in our interest
to turn away the hand of peace.

145
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,770
We won't let you down.

146
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:47,930
But, Commander Romanos, if you do
let us down, we will destroy you.

147
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,970
If you betray us one more time...

148
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,090
know that we will trample you
under our horses hooves.

149
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,610
We both want peace.

150
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,530
Then...

151
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,090
good day to you.

152
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,490
Osman, you are such a beautiful child.

153
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,730
I just got him to sleep. Don't touch him.

154
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,570
What's with the temper?

155
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,930
Why do you protect the child so?

156
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,050
Its own mother wouldn't be so cautious.

157
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,490
Do you not trust me?

158
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,090
You brought the head
of Ertuğrul Bey's enemy to the tent.

159
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,490
Ertuğrul Bey trusts you.

160
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,170
However...

161
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,810
even though I didn't
bear Osman, I do feed him.

162
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,330
I look after him
as if he was my own child.

163
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,650
What harm do you see in me caressing him
that causes you to intervene?

164
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,850
Osman didn't eat for a long time.

165
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,530
He has my milk now
but he needs to rest to grow stronger.

166
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,130
What's going on, ladies?

167
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,770
We are tending to Osman, Hayme Hatun.

168
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:22,170
God bless him.
He is like a ray of light, praise be.

169
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,010
It's obvious he will be a wonderful child.

170
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,570
Sugay, my girl.

171
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,570
Are you all right? You look so tired.

172
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,890
I hope nothing is wrong.

173
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,250
As you said,
I am a little tired, Hayme Hatun.

174
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:54,530
I will rest as soon as Osman
recovers a little more of his strength.

175
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,170
All right, my girl.

176
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:03,330
Ertuğrul Bey is inside. You may see him.

177
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,770
Your brother fell asleep at last.

178
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:20,050
Father, you've taken care of us
since my mother left.

179
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,370
You feed us, give us water,
dress us, and put us to sleep.

180
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,210
Of course I do, son.

181
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,850
But you also have your duty to do.

182
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,330
How is it you're always looking after us?

183
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,050
Maybe you should think about
getting us a new mother, Father.

184
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,530
-May I enter, Ertuğrul Bey?
-Come, Almila Hatun.

185
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,090
My condolences, Ertuğrul Bey.

186
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,090
Thank you.

187
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,530
-What is it?
-I came about a matter of trade.

188
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,050
But I can see you are busy.

189
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,730
Come, sit down.

190
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,050
Talk to me, Almila Hatun.

191
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,530
Our hides have proved
popular with the people.

192
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,210
I spoke to the Rum notables.
They too liked our hides very much.

193
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,890
They want to buy a great number from us.

194
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:57,330
Our earnings will increase and it will
provide work for the people here.

195
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,450
And you will make earnings
through the tax due to you.

196
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,130
I want authority from you

197
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,810
to agree the deal and set it in
motion with the Rum merchants.

198
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,170
With the honesty
you've shown at Hanli bazaar

199
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,650
you helped us establish
a more just system, Almila Hatun.

200
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,370
On top of that, by bringing me
the head of Kritos after the tannery raid,

201
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,570
you gained my trust.

202
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,890
I would like to receive you
at my tent this evening.

203
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,610
We can talk about
this matter in more detail.

204
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:37,130
As you wish, Ertuğrul Bey. Thank you.

205
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,970
May God allow you to see the day
your sons wield swords, Ertuğrul Bey.

206
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,690
Amen.

207
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,290
The Mongols killed my mother and father.

208
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,530
My brother and I grew up alone.

209
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,010
Your sons are very fortunate
to have a father like you

210
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,690
and a grandmother like
Mother Hayme to take care of them.

211
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,930
You tend to your sons
despite your other responsibilities.

212
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,650
May God always keep you with them.

213
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,730
Amen, Almila Hatun.

214
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,050
-Excuse me.
-You may go.

215
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:51,450
Gündüz, see to the bed
so I can put your brother down.

216
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,010
Men, this is the way to Söğüt.

217
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,130
Those in the vanguard will take measures
to establish where the tribe will be set.

218
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:18,930
A unit is to be positioned at stages
along the road to ensure safe passage.

219
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:24,930
Two units, one at the front and one
at the rear, will escort the convoy.

220
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,330
-May I enter, my Bey?
-Come.

221
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,170
My bey, a commander
has arrived from Konya.

222
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,770
He says he brings an important
letter from the sultan.

223
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,250
A letter from the sultan? Show him in.

224
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,410
-Begin preparations.
-As you command, my Bey.

225
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,450
What's this about a letter
from our sultan, commander?

226
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,810
Our sultan commands Ertuğrul Bey act
as envoy to the Mongol Khan Ogedei.

227
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,890
Envoy to Ogedei?

228
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,210
This is the sealed order, my Bey.

229
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,490
And these are to be
entrusted to Ertuğrul Bey.

230
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,810
-Is there a situation, Commander?
-I don't know, my Bey.

231
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:33,890
The sultan's personal demands
are contained in these documents.

232
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,450
They need to be given
to Ertuğrul Bey immediately.

233
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,690
All right.

234
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,090
Then let's get them
to Ertuğrul Bey right now.

235
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,810
Can I come in?

236
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,210
My Osman.

237
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,170
My brave son who came as a gift.

238
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,690
May God render you fortunate.

239
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,890
I thank God for sending you to me.

240
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,610
Sugay Hatun.

241
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,490
May God bless you too.

242
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,570
You came at my darkest hour...

243
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,530
and what you brought kept my Osman alive.

244
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,930
You provided hope... for Osman and for me.

245
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,490
In his mother's absence...

246
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,650
you took him as your own.

247
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:07,410
It was very hard to bear
the loss of my own child.

248
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,490
But... Osman has come
into my life like the sun.

249
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,890
God has allowed me
to nurse this beautiful child.

250
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:23,490
I would like to bring him up
worthy of God.

251
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:29,250
You and I are being tested
severely, Sugay Hatun.

252
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,010
What God sends...

253
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,210
we must accept without question.

254
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:44,890
From now on...
my home is your home.

255
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,770
And Osman...

256
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,130
will always be a son of yours.

257
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,090
That would please me greatly,
Ertuğrul Bey.

258
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,810
My dear mother. My doe-eyed mother.

259
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,490
If only you knew
how much I missed you already.

260
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:17,730
If you came back now...
I'd hug you so tight.

261
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,450
If you would say once more to me,
"My Gündüz, my valiant son",

262
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:31,850
I'd never upset you again
and I'd always do what you said.

263
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,650
If only you knew how
much I missed you, Mother.

264
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,050
My brothers are so small.

265
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:16,570
My father does everything he can
to tend to our every need.

266
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:24,570
But how can he carry
this burden on his own?

267
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,490
What will we do without you, Mother?

268
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,370
Son.

269
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,010
Ibnu'l Arabi, sir.

270
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,570
Were you pouring water
over your mother's grave and praying, son?

271
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,290
Yes, sir.

272
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,890
Good for you.

273
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,410
He who visits his mother's grave
to pray and pour water over it...

274
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,850
is a very dutiful child.

275
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:58,890
Thank you, sir.

276
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,290
However, I'm very upset
my mother went away.

277
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:10,690
I want to stand tall. But it is very hard.

278
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:14,970
Come now.

279
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,250
Come and sit.

280
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,690
I want to tell you about someone.

281
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,530
When this boy was still
in his mother's womb

282
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:57,050
he lost his father.

283
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,290
He was born fatherless.

284
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:07,890
He lost his mother as a small child
and soon after that his grandfather too,

285
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,570
the man who had taken him under his wing.

286
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:18,010
Cruel men who saw he had no one...
pursued him without mercy.

287
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:23,810
They wanted to turn him from his cause.

288
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,970
They tortured and tormented him.

289
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:35,050
They despised him and poured dirt
over his head... while he was praying.

290
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,930
He sought to enlighten their dark souls...

291
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,450
but those cruel men just made fun of him.

292
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,530
If that wasn't enough,
they had him stoned.

293
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,210
But even as he was being stoned...

294
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,490
he did not pray ill
of those who had ordered it.

295
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,090
He prayed they should be saved.

296
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:05,450
He then saw the loss of his precious wife,
his beloved and his source of comfort...

297
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:08,570
and also his uncle,
who had protected him.

298
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:12,450
These losses weighed
so heavily on his heart

299
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,650
the year was deemed "the year of sorrow".

300
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:23,610
He buried his young children
with his own hands.

301
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,330
Do you know what he did
in the face of all this pain, son?

302
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,370
What did he do, sir?

303
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,130
He showed no sign of despair.

304
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,890
He spoke not a word
of defiance against his fate.

305
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,250
With determination...

306
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,330
and with loyalty to his cause...

307
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,370
he continued on his path.

308
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,490
Who is this blessed person, sir?

309
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:58,210
Why did he have to endure so much?

310
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,890
The master of the universe...

311
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:06,330
he who was sent
as a blessing to the realms...

312
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,730
our great prophet
Muhammed Mustafa, my son.

313
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:20,930
Our Prophet was steadfast
and compassionate.

314
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,410
He was patient in the face
of so many trials.

315
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:30,610
My father tells us
to follow our Prophet's path

316
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:34,330
and let him guide us.

317
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:36,170
I guess that's why.

318
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:43,370
My son, this world is full
of things which will test us.

319
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,690
God demands the most
of the ones he loves the most.

320
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,450
Because if God loves a person...

321
00:46:54,530 --> 00:47:00,130
he strengthens them and helps them rise
by making them endure such ordeals.

322
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:05,050
You know, the further back
an arrow is pulled...

323
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,570
the further it flies when released.

324
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:15,970
It falls on you now
to take care of your brothers.

325
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,010
To support your father.

326
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,770
If you make the effort...

327
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:28,650
God will reward you with the patience
and resilience to see it through.

328
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:30,810
God willing, sir.

329
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,570
Come now, let us pray
for the souls of our Prophet...

330
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,730
and of Halime Sultan.

331
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,490
I told them,
"If you ever betray this peace...

332
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,930
we will trample you
under our horses hooves," my Bey.

333
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,810
Good, Turgut.

334
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,570
We need to be cautious.

335
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,650
Keep your eyes and ears open.

336
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:21,730
Byzantium has ten tongues
and every one of them lies.

337
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:28,290
The doors to Söğüt
are now open to us, my Bey.

338
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,730
Söğüt...

339
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,170
Halime and I...

340
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,810
would often talk about
the home we would create there.

341
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,730
We were going to further our tribe...

342
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,410
and our lineage there.

343
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,170
My Bey...

344
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:21,730
That blessed home will still
be built there, thanks to you.

345
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:26,450
We will further our tribe and lineage.

346
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:28,610
My father...

347
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,770
died in my arms.

348
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,690
I've lost so many loved ones, Bamsı.

349
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:41,410
But the pain of losing Halime...

350
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,330
cuts into my heart like a knife.

351
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,490
With every passing moment,
it cuts me deeper.

352
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,170
I know, my Bey, I know.

353
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,610
I know only too well
how that pain takes root in your heart.

354
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,130
It seems...

355
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,650
we only truly understand...

356
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,290
the value of our loved ones
when they are gone.

357
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:23,330
I wish I'd given her more of my time
while she was alive.

358
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:28,570
I would give the world
to have her here by my side

359
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:32,450
so that I may look
into her eyes one more time.

360
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:36,810
When a man buries his beloved,

361
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,330
he buries half his heart
beside her, my Bey.

362
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:43,890
That is true, Turgut.

363
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,610
And what's left of our heart
belongs to our children...

364
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,090
and our cause.

365
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:58,930
If not this way...

366
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:03,970
the pain of our loss
would make the world unendurable.

367
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,170
We...

368
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,810
need to collect ourselves.

369
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,170
We should not...

370
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,490
make an extravagant display
of either our pain or our love.

371
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,810
-You're right, my Bey.
-You're right, my Bey.

372
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,970
Come now, my brave men.

373
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:05,730
Can I come in?

374
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,290
Welcome, my son.

375
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:24,610
Praise be...
Osman is growing stronger, Mother.

376
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:26,650
Thank God.

377
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,530
Thank God for sending
Sugay Hatun to you, my son.

378
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:36,250
She treats Osman as if he were her own.

379
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,370
If it hadn't been for her...

380
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,250
where would our Osman be now?

381
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:45,090
Thank God, Mother.

382
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,010
Sugay Hatun is a part of our family now.

383
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:55,010
As you ordered...
a tent is being prepared for her.

384
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,850
It will be ready soon, God willing.

385
00:52:58,610 --> 00:52:59,890
God willing, Mother.

386
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,290
What would I have done
if I'd not had you here with me, Mother?

387
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,090
May God always keep you with us.

388
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,650
My valiant boy.

389
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,250
You have survived many ordeals.

390
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,330
You have walked fiery paths.

391
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,690
But you never gave up.

392
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,210
I know.

393
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:35,450
The pain of losing Halime
lies heavy on your heart.

394
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,770
But even in your saddest moments...

395
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:47,090
you still thought of your children,
of your family, of your tribe.

396
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:53,010
May God always keep <i>you </i>with us, my son.

397
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:01,050
My Gündüz, my Savci, my Osman...

398
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,450
they are all my sons.

399
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,170
They are a piece of me.

400
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,050
Be comforted by that.

401
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,010
Mother.

402
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,290
What could those drums herald?

403
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,250
I hope all is well.

404
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,290
The alps are outside, Mother.
They'll come and tell us soon.

405
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,450
He burned everything down!

406
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,410
Alps! Alps!

407
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,330
Return your swords to their scabbards!

408
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:27,090
We need to find out first what has given
this bastard the audacity to come here.

409
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,090
I come in peace.

410
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:49,130
What peace?
We've no time for your lies, Noyan!

411
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:50,930
How dare you come here?

412
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,490
I come here at the order of Ogedei,
Khan of Khans...

413
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:59,850
and at the request
of your sultan, Giyaseddin.

414
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:03,090
What did the dog say?

415
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:30,170
Here is your sultan's decree.

416
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,890
He burned everything we had!

417
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:49,010
What are you doing, woman?

418
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:53,530
-Murderer!
-Punish him!

419
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:56,490
This bastard put my tribe to the sword.
Let go of me!

420
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:01,690
-I'm going to kill this dog, let go!
-Calm down, woman.

421
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,450
Are you going to allow...

422
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,770
a half-crazed woman
to attack Ogedei's envoy?

423
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,770
Oguz Alp, get Almila Hatun out of here<i>.</i>

424
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:29,450
If you don't punish the greatest devil
this world has ever known,

425
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:33,370
tell Ertuğrul Bey I will torment him
in this world and the next!

426
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:39,290
-Oguz Alp.
-Let go! Let go of me!

427
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,250
Let go!

428
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,250
Tell Ertuğrul Bey I am here.

429
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:19,730
Abdurrahman.

430
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,090
Go to Ertuğrul Bey immediately.

431
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:26,010
-Kill him!
-Take his head!

432
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:28,130
Kill him!

433
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:30,130
Get rid of him!

434
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:48,250
-May I enter, my Bey?
-Come, Abdurrahman.

435
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,530
-My Bey.
-What's all the noise, Abdurrahman?

436
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:57,690
Noyan.

437
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:04,650
He has come here to see you
at the request of our sultan.

438
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:08,450
-What are you saying, Abdurrahman?
-My God.

439
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:11,050
My God, give me strength.

440
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:13,690
Our sultan's decree, my Bey.

441
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:48,610
Tell Artuk Bey, Turgut Bey and Bamsı
to go to my tent and wait for me there.

442
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,890
-Let Noyan wait.
-As you command, my Bey.

443
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:59,850
What does this dog want from us, son?
What is he doing here?

444
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:05,290
Our Sultan entrusts Noyan's life
to me in his decree, Mother.

445
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,650
He wants us to treat him as our guest.

446
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:17,690
But he is to say why...
with his own messengers.

447
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:50,610
What is it, Almila Hatun?

448
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:56,970
I come from the tribe, Günalp Bey.
Noyan just turned up there.

449
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:59,770
-Noyan?
-Noyan.

450
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,850
He was one of the bastards
who murdered my family.

451
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:06,490
I'd have killed him
but the alps stopped me.

452
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:10,970
All right. We ride to the tribe too.

453
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:15,370
Let's hurry. God speed.

454
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:17,810
God speed, Günalp Bey.

455
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:31,250
<i>Why do you show yourself</i>
<i>like this, brother, why?</i>

456
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:47,130
That woman rides
just like the Mongols do, my Bey.

457
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:50,250
Her horse is like theirs, too.

458
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:56,570
{\an8}I noticed. Come on.

459
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,159
My Bey, we don't know
if he's telling the truth or not.

460
01:03:06,439 --> 01:03:09,479
Let me kill him for you right here.

461
01:03:11,919 --> 01:03:16,279
If we were to kill an envoy of Ögedei
who was here at the orders of our Sultan,

462
01:03:16,999 --> 01:03:19,719
we'd give him the excuse
he wants to attack our land, Bamsi.

463
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:27,519
Ögedei Khan would call
our Sultan to account for Noyan,

464
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:30,199
knowing his army is a stone's
throw away from us in Şimal.

465
01:03:31,439 --> 01:03:35,119
What if he's lying?
What if this is a ploy, my Bey?

466
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:38,959
The only way we'll find out for sure

467
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,679
is to have Noyan address
Ertuğrul Bey directly.

468
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:51,359
Abdur Rahman.

469
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,799
-Show Noyan in.
-Your wish is my command, my Bey.

470
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:02,759
May God steer us safely through this.

471
01:05:58,719 --> 01:05:59,959
Gok Tengri.<i>..</i>

472
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:07,119
rotates the world around the sun
on and on, never stopping.

473
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,359
He turns it...

474
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:14,199
to keep our eagerness...

475
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:20,039
to stand up and fight
constant and undiminished.

476
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,919
Here I am again, Ertuğrul.

477
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,279
The spirits didn't want me to die.

478
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:37,799
The spirits...

479
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:43,319
know the account between
you and me is not yet settled.

480
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,319
You wanted to bury me in the ground.

481
01:06:56,399 --> 01:06:59,079
But mother earth didn't take me.

482
01:06:59,759 --> 01:07:05,079
Mother earth would have vomited
a bastard like you out of her soil, Noyan.

483
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:15,279
Your tongue is
as sharp as your sword, Ertuğrul.

484
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:22,439
I'm grateful to the spirits,

485
01:07:22,999 --> 01:07:27,079
for granting me a wise
and brave enemy like you.

486
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:31,599
Tell me, what is it you want, Noyan?

487
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:38,519
First, my condolences.

488
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:44,599
I heard that Halime Sultan died.

489
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:52,679
She was a courageous woman.

490
01:07:54,399 --> 01:07:58,439
At one time, she gave me
as hard a time as you did.

491
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:05,399
What do Ögedei Khan
and our sultan want with me?

492
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:09,559
You probably heard
the khan of the khans, Ögedei Khan,

493
01:08:09,959 --> 01:08:13,079
and I won a famous victory
in a great battle recently.

494
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:17,319
We took Kiev.

495
01:08:19,239 --> 01:08:25,799
The Black Sea, just like the Caspian
and the Aral seas, is our sea now.

496
01:08:28,519 --> 01:08:31,039
We rule half the world, Ertuğrul.

497
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:35,759
Now we're impatient
to take the other half.

498
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:40,879
Get to the point.
Why are you here, Noyan?

499
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:53,439
I am here as Ögedei Khan's envoy, bringing
his orders to your Sultan Giyaseddin.

500
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:03,119
As you'll have surmised, your sultan...
swore to follow the orders of my Khan.

501
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:12,959
But your young sultan has made
a request to Ögedei Khan.

502
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:24,119
And the envoy he chose
to convey this request, is you.

503
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:40,919
So you see, you and I have
a long journey ahead of us, Ertuğrul.

504
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,599
My Bey, you can't trust a word he says.

505
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,559
-<i>May I enter, my Bey?</i>
-Come, Günalp Bey.

506
01:10:14,839 --> 01:10:16,519
Orders from our sultan, my Bey.

507
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:27,319
Read it aloud so everyone knows
this heathen speaks the truth.

508
01:10:50,919 --> 01:10:51,959
Our sultan...

509
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:59,759
orders me to be his envoy...
to Ögedei Khan.

510
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:21,759
Our sultan wants you
to take this bag with you.

511
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:35,439
Sugay, daughter,
put this thick blanket on too.

512
01:12:35,799 --> 01:12:37,679
It's going to be frosty tonight.

513
01:13:01,959 --> 01:13:03,119
Mother Hayme...

514
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:07,039
we had our share of trouble
from those bastard Mongols too.

515
01:13:08,959 --> 01:13:13,559
They used to raid our tents.
They never got tired of harassing us.

516
01:13:19,519 --> 01:13:22,239
They showed no mercy
when they slaughtered my family.

517
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:25,159
I've hated them my whole life.

518
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:28,639
May God save us from their malice.

519
01:13:29,559 --> 01:13:31,799
I see you have suffered
a great deal, daughter.

520
01:13:33,479 --> 01:13:36,399
May God ensure your parents rest in peace.

521
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:39,959
It's not easy to bear
what you've been through.

522
01:13:42,599 --> 01:13:47,239
Amen. Our struggle against
the Mongols is very hard.

523
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,279
May God help Ertuğrul Bey and our state.

524
01:13:55,479 --> 01:13:57,799
Amen, my girl. Amen.

525
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:04,359
As soon as we rid ourselves
of one trouble, another rears its head.

526
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:10,759
We only just dealt with that evil Kopek...

527
01:14:11,879 --> 01:14:15,879
and now it is this bastard Noyan
who haunts us.

528
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:18,879
May God help us.

529
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:25,119
A new plague has reached our door.

530
01:14:26,439 --> 01:14:28,039
We have to be careful.

531
01:14:29,479 --> 01:14:33,999
If we stand united against the enemy,
no one can defeat us.

532
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,039
I hope so, my girl. I hope so.

533
01:15:21,599 --> 01:15:23,159
God help us.

534
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:50,319
Bamsi,

535
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:55,119
take Abdur Rahman and Oğuz and five alps.

536
01:15:57,239 --> 01:15:59,199
Noyan will stay
at the Hanlı Bazaar tonight.

537
01:15:59,759 --> 01:16:01,479
Your wish is my command, my Bey.

538
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:05,839
You won't have me stay here
as your guest, Ertuğrul?

539
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:11,199
We don't turn anyone
away from our tent, Noyan.

540
01:16:12,679 --> 01:16:14,479
You'll be my guest at the Hanlı Bazaar.

541
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:17,039
When do we set forth?

542
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:25,479
You'll find out in the morning, Noyan.

543
01:16:30,279 --> 01:16:31,799
What are you saying, Ertuğrul?

544
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:35,279
Will you refuse
to be your sultan's envoy?

545
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:41,719
Bamsi.

546
01:16:45,959 --> 01:16:50,919
Get Noyan away from here
before something happens to him.

547
01:16:57,799 --> 01:16:59,319
That's all I'll say now.

548
01:18:46,559 --> 01:18:47,839
Alps.

549
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:55,399
What have they been up to?

550
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:59,679
All they've done in eat, like bears
that've just woken up, Chief Alp Bamsi.

551
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:02,919
They eat more than me.

552
01:19:06,639 --> 01:19:10,119
Watch they don't choke on it and die.

553
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:14,919
Whatever Ertuğrul Bey's orders are,

554
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:18,079
death will come
to this heathen by our hands.

555
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,999
You said it, Chief Alp Bamsi. God willing.

556
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,199
God willing. God willing.

557
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:33,319
Come over, iron man.
Come and share my table.

558
01:19:34,959 --> 01:19:38,159
I wouldn't even share my sin
with someone like you, Noyan.

559
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,319
But if you can't share my dinner now...

560
01:19:46,639 --> 01:19:51,919
how will you share your stinking state
and these glorious lands,

561
01:19:52,599 --> 01:19:56,039
and even those rosy-cheeked women
of yours, when the time comes?

562
01:20:09,799 --> 01:20:12,639
What's wrong, iron man? Why hold back?

563
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:16,439
Or do you want to keep that grudge
you nurture all to yourself too?

564
01:20:17,919 --> 01:20:20,999
Its time will come, Noyan.
Its time will come.

565
01:20:21,799 --> 01:20:27,119
And when it does,
I'll cut out your snake's tongue.

566
01:20:28,759 --> 01:20:31,639
I'll tell you what will happen
when the time comes, iron man.

567
01:20:33,839 --> 01:20:35,039
When the time comes,

568
01:20:35,799 --> 01:20:39,719
the spirits hidden in the beech trees
will appear one by one.

569
01:20:41,559 --> 01:20:46,919
The screams of these spirits
will drown out the sound of your horses.

570
01:20:47,919 --> 01:20:52,079
While your Sultan Giyaseddin
washes his father's blood off his hands,

571
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:56,839
he'll keep on making mistakes,
keep on making terrible mistakes,

572
01:20:57,399 --> 01:21:02,399
so that first, he'll have to share
his palace with me and then his harem.

573
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:24,759
Then I'll come back here.

574
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,959
I'll destroy the regime
Ertuğrul has maintained.

575
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:34,759
He'll be scorched by my fire
under the shade of his tent.

576
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:38,999
Along with all his family.

577
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:42,199
Comrades!

578
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:51,439
The Avsars, the Kiniks...

579
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:59,679
the Dodurgas and the Cavdars,
will have no place to run.

580
01:22:00,599 --> 01:22:02,959
They'll surrender to the fate laid out
for them

581
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:04,919
on the slopes of Khan Tengri mountain.

582
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:12,039
They'll stand in front of me
with bent necks and kiss my boots.

583
01:22:14,799 --> 01:22:18,559
As for the Kayi, they won't get away
just with kissing my boots.

584
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,879
I'll make them taste a less happy fate.

585
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:36,919
I'll skin Ertuğrul's whole family

586
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,359
and sew myself a great tent out of them.

587
01:22:42,559 --> 01:22:48,599
Skin your bastards first, Noyan,
to patch the holes in your rotten flesh

588
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:51,239
that my Bey made with his sword.

589
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:57,319
Your foul-smelling, rotten flesh
which I wouldn't even use

590
01:22:57,559 --> 01:23:00,079
to line the soles of my boots.

591
01:23:19,399 --> 01:23:21,359
Laugh, Noyan. Laugh.

592
01:23:22,919 --> 01:23:26,839
When the cool dawn wind blows, Noyan!

593
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,119
When the northern goshawk
with the grey beard sings;

594
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:33,639
when the Bedouin horses
see their master and neigh;

595
01:23:33,919 --> 01:23:39,679
when the long-bearded stranger shouts;
when white becomes black;

596
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:45,399
when the bride and daughter
of the numerous Oghuz

597
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:48,719
is decked out for battle, for freedom;

598
01:23:48,879 --> 01:23:54,039
when the sun hits the beautifully
breasted rough mountains;

599
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:59,119
when the brave men, the heroes,
come together;

600
01:23:59,919 --> 01:24:05,399
the wrath of God, Noyan, will be on you!

601
01:24:05,599 --> 01:24:07,359
God is the greatest!

602
01:24:07,519 --> 01:24:08,959
God is the greatest!

603
01:24:09,319 --> 01:24:10,799
God is the greatest!

604
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,799
God is the greatest!

605
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:20,239
You keep taking shelter
behind the tales of your ancestors.

606
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:25,559
I came here not to retell tales,
I came here to make history.

607
01:24:29,559 --> 01:24:31,039
God is the greatest!

608
01:24:31,159 --> 01:24:32,759
God is the greatest!

609
01:24:32,879 --> 01:24:34,479
God is the greatest!

610
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:35,999
God is the greatest!

611
01:24:36,199 --> 01:24:37,439
God is the greatest!

612
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:39,279
God is the greatest!

613
01:24:43,719 --> 01:24:46,479
Our sultan wants to send you
into the Mongolian hell, my Bey.

614
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:52,159
But as long as Noyan remains with us,
we won't be safe.

615
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:57,239
Our sultan knows that you and Noyan are
at daggers drawn, my Bey.

616
01:24:58,599 --> 01:25:02,359
So why does he take the risk
of sending you with him?

617
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,999
-There, there, Savci.
-Give him to me.

618
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:36,479
Keep on growing, my lion.
You're going to be a fine man.

619
01:25:39,799 --> 01:25:42,199
You'll travel these lands
on the back of your horse.

620
01:25:43,959 --> 01:25:47,039
Everyone will know you
when you put on your sword.

621
01:25:49,919 --> 01:25:54,839
Wolf-eyed like my ancestor Oghuz,
my heavenly son.

622
01:25:57,239 --> 01:26:02,799
Son, what is this about
our sultan wanting you to be his envoy?

623
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:05,359
It's important, Mother.

624
01:26:12,799 --> 01:26:15,119
I've never seen Ertuğrul Bey
look so worried before.

625
01:26:15,759 --> 01:26:19,159
More pain comes before the last
has receded, Günalp Bey.

626
01:26:20,999 --> 01:26:24,159
His alps, brave men, all martyred.

627
01:26:25,159 --> 01:26:27,839
The grief of losing
Halime Hatun still consumes him.

628
01:26:28,919 --> 01:26:31,759
He's not being given a chance
to mourn his woman.

629
01:26:33,639 --> 01:26:37,479
First brother Ahmet,
and now this devil Noyan turns up.

630
01:26:45,639 --> 01:26:46,799
His children...

631
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,319
Those three little boys left motherless.

632
01:26:59,599 --> 01:27:01,919
Our bey will make his decision.

633
01:27:02,599 --> 01:27:06,959
And when he does,
he will fulfil his promise,

634
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:09,079
even if it kills him.

635
01:27:09,559 --> 01:27:11,719
-God protect him.
-God protect him.

636
01:27:14,879 --> 01:27:18,919
Do you remember Mother,
when I first brought Halime to the tent...

637
01:27:19,839 --> 01:27:22,039
I was an envoy then too.

638
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:27,119
Now Halime is gone,

639
01:27:28,959 --> 01:27:30,839
and I have the duties
of an envoy once again.

640
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:33,799
It is fate, Mother.

641
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:40,239
I remember. How could I forget?

642
01:27:42,599 --> 01:27:44,639
Duty is important son,

643
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:50,039
but going to the Mongol Khan
with this evil Noyan...

644
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,759
We can't know what will happen,
what troubles you'll face.

645
01:28:00,599 --> 01:28:04,359
Father, are you going to leave us again?

646
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,159
What will we do when you're gone?

647
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:13,079
I'm big now, but what about Savci?

648
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:15,919
And Osman?

649
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:22,039
Look how quiet Osman is when
you hold him in your arms.

650
01:28:22,879 --> 01:28:26,639
What if he cries again and wants you?

651
01:28:39,519 --> 01:28:42,119
My Gündüz, my lion.

652
01:28:42,679 --> 01:28:46,759
You said it was important.
What if you don't come back?

653
01:28:47,519 --> 01:28:49,079
My mother's gone.

654
01:28:50,519 --> 01:28:53,559
How are we to manage if you go too?

655
01:28:57,079 --> 01:29:00,279
What will we do if
you leave this world too?

656
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:31,319
I've been waiting for you, Alangoya.

657
01:29:49,999 --> 01:29:51,519
Is what I heard true, brother?

658
01:29:54,959 --> 01:29:59,279
Ertuğrul will accompany me
to see Ögedei as an envoy.

659
01:30:02,919 --> 01:30:04,719
And you'll kill him on the way.

660
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:07,999
That depends on what Ertuğrul decides.

661
01:30:11,159 --> 01:30:12,359
What do you mean?

662
01:30:12,839 --> 01:30:16,919
Whether my grudge remains or not
depends on what Ertuğrul decides.

663
01:30:17,559 --> 01:30:19,159
What do you want from him, brother?

664
01:30:23,319 --> 01:30:24,839
Victory, Alangoya.

665
01:30:26,559 --> 01:30:27,599
Victory.

666
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:30,399
A bloodless victory.

667
01:30:31,919 --> 01:30:37,439
Ögedei asked me to persuade
the brave Turk beys to obey him.

668
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:41,959
Beginning with Ertuğrul.

669
01:30:43,559 --> 01:30:48,439
Now, as Ertuğrul is due to
come before Ögedei as an envoy...

670
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,919
Ögedei will hear Ertuğrul's
decision himself.

671
01:30:54,439 --> 01:30:57,799
We'll win this battle without
our swords being soaked in blood.

672
01:31:02,279 --> 01:31:04,119
As for you, Alangoya...

673
01:31:06,919 --> 01:31:10,239
you are to remain
as my eyes and ears in these lands.

674
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:15,279
Rouse the broody hen inside you.

675
01:31:17,479 --> 01:31:21,439
Endear yourself...

676
01:31:22,759 --> 01:31:26,279
to the hearts of Ertuğrul's children
and his mother.

677
01:31:27,079 --> 01:31:31,999
Neither Ertuğrul nor his family
should learn who you are.

678
01:31:33,319 --> 01:31:36,199
Until we have achieved
our purpose, that is.

679
01:31:39,759 --> 01:31:42,039
What if Ertuğrul refuses to obey Ögedei ?

680
01:31:46,039 --> 01:31:49,959
Then they all die,
including Osman in his cradle.

681
01:31:53,959 --> 01:31:57,839
Keep your sword sharp
and your heart as soft

682
01:31:57,919 --> 01:32:01,079
as the snow on the slopes
of Khan Tengri mountain, Alangoya.

683
01:32:20,199 --> 01:32:25,639
Apparently, the fate of the state
depends once more upon us doing our duty.

684
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:31,919
We need to fulfill this duty

685
01:32:32,959 --> 01:32:35,559
if we are going to ensure
no lives are lost.

686
01:32:38,439 --> 01:32:42,719
We'll set forth tomorrow morning
for Ögedei Khan.

687
01:32:51,079 --> 01:32:54,199
Turgut, Bamsi and some
of the alps will accompany me.

688
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:56,519
Of course, my Bey.

689
01:32:56,879 --> 01:32:58,519
The castle is entrusted
to you, Günalp Bey.

690
01:32:58,919 --> 01:32:59,959
Very good, my Bey.

691
01:33:01,759 --> 01:33:04,639
Artuk Bey, you will be responsible
for the tribe and the Hanlı Bazaar.

692
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:06,839
As you command, my Bey.

693
01:33:10,119 --> 01:33:13,719
All of you, keep your eyes
and ears open.

694
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:21,159
Monitor who comes and goes
and check them all thoroughly.

695
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:25,679
Be sure they are who they say they are.

696
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:31,599
If Noyan has returned...

697
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:36,279
I've no doubt he's placed his spies
in every corner.

698
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:40,919
After the dark days we've experienced,
we head into our toughest mission yet.

699
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:44,319
May God help us all, my Bey.

700
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:46,639
Amen, Turgut.

701
01:33:49,519 --> 01:33:52,799
For the sake of our state,
we will endure our darkest hour

702
01:33:53,479 --> 01:33:57,359
by turning our hearts as hard as stone
as we set out on the road again.

703
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:04,319
In this blessed cause, we will be
separated from the people of our tribe.

704
01:34:06,559 --> 01:34:11,319
If the need arises, we must be prepared
to be separated

705
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:14,199
from our loved ones and our home.

706
01:34:18,759 --> 01:34:21,199
If the state isn't everlasting...

707
01:34:22,919 --> 01:34:25,399
if our homeland isn't prosperous...

708
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:32,639
our tents, our children,
what does any of it matter?

709
01:34:33,999 --> 01:34:35,879
Only that the state exists.

710
01:34:37,559 --> 01:34:39,719
Only that our homeland survives.

711
01:34:41,479 --> 01:34:45,279
Only that we are free.

712
01:34:52,959 --> 01:34:59,639
It is an honor for us to commit our hearts
and our lives to this blessed cause.

713
01:35:32,839 --> 01:35:34,239
My Savci.

714
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:44,439
My Osman.

715
01:36:47,559 --> 01:36:48,759
My Savci.

716
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:51,559
My Gündüz.

717
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:56,199
I thank God for giving you to me.

718
01:37:30,439 --> 01:37:34,959
Son, you only just buried your wife...

719
01:37:37,079 --> 01:37:42,599
Your tiny son is still in his cradle.
And now this parting...

720
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:48,079
When the order comes from the sultan,
we must surrender to our fate.

721
01:37:48,839 --> 01:37:49,919
You know that, Mother.

722
01:37:52,199 --> 01:37:54,919
Our way is one of sacrifice...

723
01:37:56,959 --> 01:37:59,279
not just our lives,
but in leaving loved ones behind.

724
01:38:03,559 --> 01:38:05,879
Go, son. Go.

725
01:38:07,919 --> 01:38:09,639
The decree comes from the state.

726
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:13,839
You've remained patient
through a grueling ordeal...

727
01:38:15,399 --> 01:38:17,519
God willing, you'll come through this.

728
01:38:18,799 --> 01:38:19,799
God willing, Mother.

729
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:24,119
Father?

730
01:38:24,879 --> 01:38:26,559
You're going too, now?

731
01:38:29,959 --> 01:38:34,919
What will I do with my brothers?
Can't you stay?

732
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:49,879
I can't do that.
How could we refuse our sultan's order?

733
01:38:52,079 --> 01:38:53,839
Grandmother will stay with you.

734
01:38:56,439 --> 01:38:57,879
Sugay Hatun, too.

735
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:02,039
Osman is so much stronger
now thanks to her.

736
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:07,479
And tell you what...

737
01:39:08,119 --> 01:39:12,159
Aren't you the bey of this tent?
Do beys ever show fear?

738
01:39:13,799 --> 01:39:15,159
As you command, Father.

739
01:39:17,759 --> 01:39:20,639
You're setting forth
on a difficult mission.

740
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:25,559
My duty is to take care of my brothers.

741
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:28,079
Yes, just like that, my brave son.

742
01:39:32,999 --> 01:39:37,199
I entrust all of you first to God,
and then to grandmother and Sugay Hatun.

743
01:39:41,079 --> 01:39:45,759
Now, it's time for you to show
what a brave bey you are, Gündüz.

744
01:39:47,799 --> 01:39:52,239
In my absence, I entrust your brothers
and the tent to your care.

745
01:39:52,839 --> 01:39:58,359
You are the bey of this tent
when I'm gone.

746
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:00,439
As you command, my Bey!

747
01:40:00,879 --> 01:40:02,799
God bless you, my brave son.

748
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:10,199
Don't you worry, my lion.

749
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:15,079
Sugay Hatun and I will do our best.

750
01:40:15,879 --> 01:40:17,119
Thank you, Mother.

751
01:40:18,279 --> 01:40:22,159
We could have no more important work
than taking care of them for you.

752
01:40:22,839 --> 01:40:24,399
Rest assured of that, Ertuğrul Bey.

753
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:28,399
Thank you, Sugay Hatun.

754
01:40:33,559 --> 01:40:34,879
I should go, Mother.

755
01:40:45,479 --> 01:40:46,959
God bless you.

756
01:40:51,639 --> 01:40:52,679
Ertuğrul...

757
01:40:55,479 --> 01:40:56,759
Be careful.

758
01:40:57,599 --> 01:41:00,599
That bastard Noyan is unpredictable.

759
01:41:00,959 --> 01:41:02,239
I will, Mother.

760
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:07,239
Until I'm sure he's dead,
I'll be sure to watch my back.

761
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:10,959
I won't give him his chance.

762
01:41:12,759 --> 01:41:14,039
Very good, son.

763
01:41:14,679 --> 01:41:17,119
We've had our fair share of misfortune.

764
01:41:17,799 --> 01:41:21,399
Make sure you come back to us safe,
God willing.

765
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:24,839
With God's permission I will, Mother.

766
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:28,639
You must start preparing
for our migration.

767
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:31,879
No more obstacles stand in our way.

768
01:41:31,959 --> 01:41:33,359
I hope not, my brave son.

769
01:41:34,039 --> 01:41:36,839
The women and I will
make sure everything is ready.

770
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:17,640
-Sir, your messenger is here.
-Bring him now.

771
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,280
I hope for good news.

772
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:34,880
Noyan is at Ertuğrul's inn, sir.

773
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,520
They'll probably set off together
with Ertuğrul.

774
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,960
Now that's good news.

775
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:44,720
Noyan is both Ögedei's best commander
and his messenger.

776
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,800
If Noyan dies, Ögedei will destroy
the Seljuks.

777
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,600
We'll start such a fire that it will
consume the Seljuks,

778
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:58,360
Ertuğrul and all the Turks in Anatolia.

779
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,240
Gather the men, we'll set off now.

780
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:03,560
I will personally come.

781
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:30,280
My love.

782
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:34,720
My brave wife.

783
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,880
Death took you to the afterlife.

784
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:50,440
I know that nobody dies before their time,

785
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:53,520
and that those who go don't return.

786
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,560
But your absence is hard, Halime.

787
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:01,800
I speak but...

788
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,000
I can't explain the fire inside me.

789
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:14,000
Only God and I know how my heart burns.

790
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,440
Our Prophet said,

791
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:29,000
"Humans are split in two,

792
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,760
and they are complete when married."

793
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,760
You completed me.

794
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:40,600
Now I'm missing a half.

795
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,600
Now I have a difficult
and fiery path ahead.

796
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:54,200
You always said farewell...

797
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,800
and prayed for me.

798
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:03,280
My heart is longing for your sweet words.

799
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,520
There's a reunion after each separation.

800
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:15,360
I hope that...

801
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:19,360
God will bring us together
in the afterlife,

802
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,640
just like he did in this one.

803
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:52,000
Turgut, you've removed the traces
of the past from your heart.

804
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,000
I see a tense bow in front of me.

805
01:46:56,200 --> 01:47:00,720
The suffering you caused to our tribe
and our loved ones...

806
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,040
sharpens our swords, Noyan.

807
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,280
-Just like old days, huh, Ertuğrul?
-Nothing is like the old days, Noyan.

808
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:13,440
True.

809
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:17,960
You're not the crybaby running after
Gündoğdu and Sungur...

810
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,400
and I'm not the Noyan
who has come to torture Erzurum.

811
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:31,120
Now, I'm a friend of your state, for which
you've risked your life many times.

812
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:42,920
I see a poor Mongol dog who I beat
many times with my sword, Noyan.

813
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:50,280
I await the moment that I take your head
like the others who threatened my state.

814
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:55,880
You mean like Emir Sadettin,
whom I had put on a leash some time ago?

815
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:03,520
Do you not know that I hold
Sultan Gıyaseddin's leash now?

816
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,880
You'll never enslave the Turks, Noyan.

817
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:15,960
Ah, Ertuğrul!

818
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:20,960
When you're in the presence
of Ögedei Khan,

819
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,440
you'll see the gates
of the world opening for you.

820
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:32,160
You and your dogs listen to me, Noyan.

821
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,240
You'll be under my protection on the road.

822
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,320
It's my duty to bring you to Ögedei Khan
safely and soundly.

823
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:44,480
Know that I'll give my life to do that.

824
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:46,800
But...

825
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,520
know that...

826
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:54,760
if you try anything against my alps
on the road,

827
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:56,920
I'll make you vomit blood.

828
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,280
Even a single drop
of my blood on these lands

829
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,600
is an invitation to Ögedei's army.

830
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:06,640
If trouble is coming,

831
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:10,680
we'll face it and crush it, Noyan.

832
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,480
I've got my eye on you.

833
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:24,200
If you're protecting me, very well.

834
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,280
Let's go.

835
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:30,080
We can't make Ögedei,
the Khan of Khans, wait.

836
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,320
Come on, alps!

837
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,480
What's the matter, Almıla Hatun?

838
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:32,960
What are those for?

839
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:36,560
For Ertuğrul Bey's children

840
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:41,080
and for any children in the tribe
who might need them, Sugay Hatun.

841
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,760
They should be happy.

842
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,320
So thoughtful.

843
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,440
They should surely be happy.

844
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:56,400
Why do you hate the Mongols so much,
Almıla Hatun?

845
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,840
The Mongols massacred my children.

846
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:13,600
So, I try to make children happy

847
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:17,920
and consider them my own children,
Sugay Hatun.

848
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,600
You don't know my pain.

849
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:30,640
I had no idea, Almıla Hatun.

850
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,680
I know what it means to lose a child.

851
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,200
It's hard.

852
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:50,200
Osman helps me dull my pain.

853
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,640
Those Mongol scum...

854
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:59,880
killed all my family.

855
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:09,120
Many children in my village were orphaned.

856
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:15,040
I long to become a mother again.

857
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:20,200
You have no idea how much it hurts,
Sugay Hatun.

858
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,160
Don't worry.

859
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,320
Keep praying.

860
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:33,360
God will answer sooner or later.

861
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,040
What are you doing, Sugay Hatun?

862
01:52:47,480 --> 01:52:48,640
Almıla Hatun...

863
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:53,200
brought hats and leather clothes
for the children.

864
01:52:55,160 --> 01:52:58,520
-So thoughtful, Almıla Hatun.
-Let's try them.

865
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:14,120
Looks good, right?

866
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,640
Anything looks good on Gündüz Alp.

867
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,920
Thanks, Almıla Hatun.

868
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:22,520
Thank you, Almıla Hatun.

869
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:25,720
I just want the kids to be happy,
Hayme Hatun.

870
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:31,360
Can I hold Osman?

871
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:51,240
Almıla Hatun.

872
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:58,120
Oh, my dear.

873
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:25,240
What's your tribe? Where are you from?

874
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:29,600
I'm from the Taurus Mountains.
I came to Ertuğrul Bey's rich lands

875
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,800
to graze and sell my herd.

876
01:54:32,440 --> 01:54:33,720
With my tribe.

877
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,320
All right, welcome.

878
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:44,360
Now, go. Have the bazaar scribe write down
your name, tribe, et cetera.

879
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:47,240
Then start trading. Go!

880
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:49,960
Thank you.

881
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,160
All right.

882
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:56,760
-Good day, Artuk Bey.
-Welcome, Günalp Bey.

883
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:59,200
-Sit down.
-Thanks.

884
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:06,480
-Are you speaking to the newcomers?
-Yes.

885
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:12,560
Ertuğrul Bey wants all incoming tribes

886
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:17,200
and merchants investigated.

887
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:21,480
So, I'm investigating them.

888
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:25,840
A new tribe is coming soon,
I'll investigate them.

889
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,440
They might have Noyan's spies among them.

890
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,040
<i>The woman rides like the Mongols, my bey.</i>

891
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:35,240
<i>Her horse looks like a Mongol horse too.</i>

892
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,080
He's right, Artuk Bey.

893
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,760
We must dig deeper into this.

894
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:49,760
I'll see what I can find
about Almıla and her men.

895
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:51,760
Almıla and her men?

896
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:56,080
Why investigate her, Günalp Bey?

897
01:55:57,320 --> 01:55:59,480
Ertuğrul Bey gave them a spot
in the bazaar.

898
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:06,400
But we don't really know who they are
and where they come from.

899
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:12,360
Foxes dressed as sheep, Artuk Bey.

900
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,120
Anyone might be a threat.

901
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:19,560
-Anyone.
-All right.

902
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,400
The horses will rest here.

903
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:56,040
We'll be at the caravansary before dark.

904
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:48,720
Great Tengri! Give me strength!

905
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:01,640
I'll burn your flesh like this, Ertuğrul!

906
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:06,880
I'll send all your family to the Red Tamu.

907
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:12,960
<i>You'll suffer what I suffered</i>
<i>one-thousand-fold!</i>

908
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:30,240
May your sword never be broken.

909
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:33,800
May your red flag never fall.

910
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,840
May your white crowned mother
rest in heaven.

911
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,120
May you never lose the hope
God gave you.

912
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:45,000
May you never lose faith.

913
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:50,360
May these prayers be accepted.

914
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:11,040
God bless you, dear.

915
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:15,520
You got used to us quickly.

916
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:18,040
And we got used to you.

917
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:47,840
I consider you my mother.

918
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,400
My dear.

919
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:03,400
Tell me now.

920
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:07,400
What's your problem?

921
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,440
If you let me,

922
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:16,000
I wish to visit my son's grave.

923
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:21,320
Of course, my dear.

924
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:22,840
Go.

925
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:26,240
See your child.

926
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:33,680
-The alps will escort you.
-Thank you, Mother Hayme.

927
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:35,080
I won't be late.

928
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:59,600
If you'd bent the knee to Ögedei,

929
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:05,840
instead of bringing the begging words
of your sultan to Ögedei now,

930
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:10,680
we'd be riding together to Danube,
Ertuğrul.

931
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:15,320
The Syr Darya and Amu Darya,

932
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:19,440
Euphrates and Tigris, we took them all.

933
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:22,800
We would tame the great Danube.

934
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:36,480
If I obeyed Ögedei,

935
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:40,080
I would have been crushed, Noyan.

936
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:52,760
We'd fight together, ride together.

937
02:04:57,440 --> 02:04:59,960
The sky would be the limit.

938
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:06,280
But if you continue like this,

939
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:10,200
following a boy sultan
who killed his father,

940
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:14,320
neither your family nor your tribe
will ever see peace.

941
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:18,800
What does that mean, Noyan?

942
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:22,120
I mean, instead of being
the sultan's messenger,

943
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:26,400
you'd lead Ögedei Khan's armies.

944
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,880
We'll surround them from three directions.

945
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:03,600
We'll kill them all.

946
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:09,720
But our main target is Noyan.

947
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:15,280
We must kill him, no matter what.

948
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,600
Noyan can't leave this place alive.

949
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,600
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

950
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:51,800
Incoming!

951
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:18,080
-Who is that?
-Günalp Bey, the castellan.

952
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:19,760
What is he doing here?

953
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,360
Don't break character.

954
02:07:32,240 --> 02:07:33,520
Good day, Almıla Hatun.

955
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:37,320
Thank you, Günalp Bey. Welcome.

956
02:07:37,880 --> 02:07:39,200
Thank you.

957
02:07:42,120 --> 02:07:44,960
Well done, you're really working hard.

958
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:50,560
We try to do our best.

959
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:54,240
I hope there aren't any problems with us.

960
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:57,320
No, don't worry.

961
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:05,080
I wanted to see the tannery
and ask if you were okay.

962
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:07,760
We never talked about...

963
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:12,560
where you're from
and what you did before.

964
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:15,400
Then come in, drink our ayran.

965
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:16,960
Thank you.

966
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:37,360
You've been rolling like a snowball
towards an abyss, Ertuğrul.

967
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:41,040
Nowhere to escape, now.

968
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:43,960
You're about to fall.

969
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:49,280
Both your state and your tribes
will surrender.

970
02:08:54,760 --> 02:08:56,600
Instead of surrendering with blood,

971
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:01,480
honorably obeying Ögedei with your swords

972
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:04,920
will make you rulers of the world,
not slaves.

973
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,760
Don't you see that?

974
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:18,280
To hell with you and your global empire!

975
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:19,560
Scum!

976
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,520
You lost many lives.

977
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:30,000
Why? For nothing.

978
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:32,320
Not for nothing, Noyan.

979
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:34,560
To be free.

980
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:38,600
Do you think you're free,
Abdur Rahman Alp?

981
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:44,560
Have patience.

982
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:48,800
You'll soon be our slaves...

983
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,120
or you'll die.

984
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:02,760
Abdur Rahman!

985
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:14,160
Noyan.

986
02:10:27,560 --> 02:10:28,520
So?

987
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:31,120
Where were you before coming here?

988
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:33,960
Around Kayseri.

989
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:38,920
We would hunt in the mountain
and produce leather products to sell.

990
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:40,520
Kayseri?

991
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:43,800
There are Ahis in Kayseri.

992
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:46,760
All tanners are united.

993
02:10:47,720 --> 02:10:48,960
You're not Ahis.

994
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,600
How did you work there?

995
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:55,240
We didn't stay long.

996
02:10:55,960 --> 02:10:59,920
We came here when we couldn't stay there.

997
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:07,960
Thanks to Ertuğrul Bey,
we're making money.

998
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:10,480
Bless him.

999
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:26,840
You were a hunter, right?

1000
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:32,480
I am.

1001
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:34,720
I've hunted since childhood.

1002
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:38,760
-I'm a good archer.
-I see that.

1003
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:42,440
Your bow shows that.

1004
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:01,280
Made from a birch tree.

1005
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:04,120
Sheep bone at both ends.

1006
02:12:08,080 --> 02:12:11,600
This has twice the range of a normal bow.

1007
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:20,120
I bought it from a trader.

1008
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:26,240
You had to have been an archer
since childhood to be able to use this.

1009
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:31,360
Because this is a Mongol bow.

1010
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:46,440
But you mastered it right after buying it.

1011
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:50,080
Well done.

1012
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:58,760
Well, enough talk.

1013
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:01,520
The castle waits.

1014
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:05,600
Have a good day.

1015
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:50,880
I told you to hide your bow and arrows,
didn't I?

1016
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:55,280
I said nobody was to use Mongol goods,
didn't I?

1017
02:13:56,280 --> 02:13:58,760
Alangoya, the man was smart.

1018
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:01,080
So what if he saw Mergen's bow?

1019
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:04,400
He was suspicious even when he came,
didn't you see?

1020
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:11,800
You're right, Bergütay.

1021
02:14:12,760 --> 02:14:14,000
He was suspicious.

1022
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:17,600
He came here to be sure.

1023
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,200
And we gave him a reason.

1024
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:21,960
How can we eliminate his doubts?

1025
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:27,320
By eliminating him.

1026
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,120
There's no other choice.

1027
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:37,200
Mergen, go kill Günalp!

1028
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:00,560
The Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit help us.

1029
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:05,440
Come on.

1030
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:27,280
Attack!

1031
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:30,560
Who shot my comrade?

1032
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:32,640
Attack, my heroic knights!

1033
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:38,840
-Kill them all!
-Commander Romanos!

1034
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:42,240
Romanos? Who is that?

1035
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:43,640
Treacherous scum!

1036
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:52,560
The scum show their filth again!

1037
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:05,160
Unleash hell!

1038
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:08,800
We'll use their skulls to drink
our victory sherbet!

1039
02:17:20,720 --> 02:17:22,040
That's them!

1040
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:26,240
Bring Sugay Hatun alive.

1041
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,400
Sugay Hatun, run!

1042
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:14,560
Catch her! The woman is getting away!

1043
02:18:57,400 --> 02:19:01,040
You're wasting our time, woman.
Drop the sword and surrender.

1044
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:06,360
I won't let you take me again, you scum!

1045
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:10,360
You tortured me.

1046
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:13,600
I buried my own baby.

1047
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:17,440
I'd rather go to hell!

1048
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:19,120
Well, we tried.

1049
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,840
Cover Bamsi!

1050
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:19,280
Here I am, brother!

1051
02:21:25,240 --> 02:21:28,120
-Bamsi, are you okay?
-Yes, brother!

1052
02:22:09,360 --> 02:22:10,600
Noyan!

1053
