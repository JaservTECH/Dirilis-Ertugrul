WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 95 will start after 12:35 min.

12:57.508 --> 12:58.748
You leave...

12:59.828 --> 13:02.028
the presence of Majesty Emir...

13:02.988 --> 13:05.508
to talk to this commander,

13:06.108 --> 13:09.068
you don't have morals
nor do you follow tradition.

13:09.908 --> 13:11.828
You can't teach me about tradition.

13:12.388 --> 13:17.068
If the hatun of the pavilion and Emir
are here, your words have no effect.

13:17.988 --> 13:19.228
How dare you?

13:29.108 --> 13:32.348
Is it tradition to advance towards
a hatun that took over...

13:33.548 --> 13:34.948
the Beylic, Bahadir Bey?

13:35.948 --> 13:37.348
You have no manners!

13:38.388 --> 13:40.788
How dare you touch a Bey?

13:43.548 --> 13:44.948
Turgut!

14:15.068 --> 14:16.028
Turgut.

14:24.348 --> 14:26.268
If you are a bey, act like one.

14:28.308 --> 14:30.148
If I didn't respect the pavilion,

14:30.868 --> 14:33.908
I'd sacrifice you with your own dagger.

14:37.708 --> 14:38.948
Enough!

14:50.748 --> 14:52.268
What is this tactlessness?

14:55.828 --> 14:57.548
Did you forget you're in my presence?

15:01.148 --> 15:02.988
You've all crossed the line.

15:03.308 --> 15:04.708
All of you.

15:10.428 --> 15:11.588
Bahadir Bey.

15:12.068 --> 15:13.828
Take your son, go to your tent.

15:14.828 --> 15:17.108
This incident will stay in this pavilion.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.428
No one will hear about it.

15:20.468 --> 15:21.748
Understood?

15:36.588 --> 15:37.748
I'll go now.

15:39.228 --> 15:41.668
But it's not over, Turgut Alp.

15:43.388 --> 15:44.628
Don't you forget that.

15:46.628 --> 15:47.788
Door!

16:09.108 --> 16:10.188
From now on...

16:11.868 --> 16:14.348
be careful about the breaths you take.

16:16.548 --> 16:19.188
If you cause trouble

16:19.508 --> 16:21.308
within the lands that I rule...

16:23.668 --> 16:25.748
I'll make you both pay for it.

16:33.068 --> 16:34.228
Door!

17:40.188 --> 17:42.068
Two of you go this way.

17:42.548 --> 17:43.628
We'll go that way.

17:44.548 --> 17:45.748
If you see something,

17:46.148 --> 17:48.868
-let me know right away.
-Yes, Commander Lukas.

18:10.508 --> 18:14.748
Let the folks know that the Beylic council
will come together in the morning.

18:16.268 --> 18:17.548
When the bey is selected,

18:17.988 --> 18:21.068
I'll go to Hanlı Bazaar
and finish the job with Bahadir Bey.

18:21.508 --> 18:25.108
After that I'll immigrate where
my brothers Gündoğdu and Sungurtekin are

18:25.788 --> 18:27.108
and unite the Kayis.

18:27.548 --> 18:29.868
-It's your call, Bey.
-Let's hope for the best.

19:45.908 --> 19:47.708
Mother, why are you crying?

19:54.868 --> 19:56.228
I miss your father, son.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.108
If your father was here...

20:00.228 --> 20:02.748
we'd never have to go through
troubles like these.

20:07.548 --> 20:08.748
Don't worry, Mother.

20:09.308 --> 20:10.868
I'll be the bey soon.

20:11.508 --> 20:13.508
You'll all live comfortably.

20:20.668 --> 20:21.948
I hope so, my Gündüz.

20:24.668 --> 20:26.508
You'll be the bey of all beys.

20:27.548 --> 20:30.228
You'll carry on your father's will.

20:31.588 --> 20:33.028
You'll spread fear among...

20:33.908 --> 20:35.668
the enemy, spread hope among the innocent.

20:39.228 --> 20:41.028
My Gündüz.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.548
Come on.

21:13.868 --> 21:14.868
Damn it.

21:16.348 --> 21:17.628
Its horseshoe has fallen off.

21:19.628 --> 21:20.828
Perfect timing.

21:22.188 --> 21:24.308
Come on, boy. Hold on a little longer.
Okay?

21:24.388 --> 21:26.388
Just a little bit more.
I know you can do it.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.188
Is that your brother?

22:14.228 --> 22:18.428
Pedro!

22:18.508 --> 22:20.828
My brother!

22:21.028 --> 22:25.588
Pedro, forgive me, Pedro.

22:26.588 --> 22:29.308
Forgive me, I couldn't protect you.

22:31.788 --> 22:36.828
Who did this, sir? Tell me
so I can kill them with my own hands.

22:39.388 --> 22:41.468
The killers of your brother
have died, Marya.

22:42.668 --> 22:43.748
I killed them all.

22:44.308 --> 22:45.468
Except Simko.

22:45.908 --> 22:48.468
He'll be here as well. When he is,
he'll get his punishment.

22:54.788 --> 22:55.948
I...

22:58.428 --> 23:00.668
I don't want you to forgive me.

23:02.668 --> 23:04.028
Kill me.

23:04.308 --> 23:07.548
Kill me right here,
right next to my brother.

23:08.708 --> 23:10.708
I don't deserve to live.

23:11.868 --> 23:14.988
I couldn't protect him
and I wasn't worthy of you.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.548
I betrayed you.

23:20.668 --> 23:22.908
Your brother paid for you betrayal, Marya.

23:23.628 --> 23:24.748
As for you,

23:25.708 --> 23:26.988
you'll be my woman

23:27.868 --> 23:31.428
till your beauty dies or someone else
seduces you and you make a mistake.

23:33.948 --> 23:35.108
Take her away.

23:35.908 --> 23:37.268
Pedro.

23:37.588 --> 23:39.708
Pedro, my brother!

23:39.828 --> 23:41.708
Pedro!

23:42.908 --> 23:46.228
Pedro, forgive me, brother.

23:47.108 --> 23:48.188
Forgive me...

23:49.308 --> 23:50.428
Come on, Ertuğrul.

23:51.148 --> 23:52.428
Come to me.

24:19.308 --> 24:20.508
His horse is missing a shoe.

24:21.508 --> 24:23.268
He can't go far, it'll stumble.

24:26.148 --> 24:27.308
Let's go after him.

24:47.748 --> 24:49.988
The dagger that you avoided
in the battlefield,

24:51.508 --> 24:52.828
found you in my pavilion.

24:54.748 --> 24:57.348
The battlefield is afield for brave men.

24:59.228 --> 25:00.708
They were only brave enough to stab us...

25:03.308 --> 25:07.028
in the field of disorder,
not on the battlefield.

25:08.948 --> 25:10.828
They partnered with Emir Sadettin

25:12.308 --> 25:14.988
and shed blood in the holy pavilion
of my Aliyar Bey.

25:18.308 --> 25:21.308
They will surely pay
for that blood one day.

25:22.428 --> 25:23.668
If not...

25:26.948 --> 25:29.628
the posts of this holy pavilion
will come down on us.

25:31.668 --> 25:32.868
Neither you nor your pavilion

25:33.788 --> 25:36.628
can see any good from a bey

25:37.388 --> 25:38.708
that serves Emir Sadettin.

25:39.548 --> 25:40.588
Turgut.

25:41.988 --> 25:44.268
I'm not strong enough to stop Bahadir Bey.

25:51.308 --> 25:52.468
You will be, Aslıhan Hatun.

25:53.948 --> 25:55.028
You will be.

25:55.948 --> 25:56.948
You should be.

25:58.468 --> 26:02.468
Bahadir's dagger
will turn around to stab you.

26:03.428 --> 26:06.028
It'll stab my people, and everything

26:06.828 --> 26:09.548
my Ertuğrul Bey and Aliyar Bey

26:10.228 --> 26:11.268
entrusted with us.

26:16.708 --> 26:17.988
We won't let that happen.

26:20.148 --> 26:21.308
Do you understand me?

26:22.948 --> 26:23.988
Even if his dagger...

26:25.628 --> 26:26.668
stabs my flesh,

26:27.628 --> 26:29.188
it can't pierce the armor in my heart.

26:31.668 --> 26:33.468
Despair doesn't suit us.

26:35.068 --> 26:37.788
You were always by my side
when I was battling...

26:39.828 --> 26:41.148
with the enemy on the border.

26:43.228 --> 26:44.388
You're the spouse in my heart

26:45.748 --> 26:47.468
and my companion for my life.

26:53.428 --> 26:55.868
None of us have the right to go back.

27:04.348 --> 27:05.948
Even if your people immigrate?

27:07.668 --> 27:09.948
Even if Bahadir Bey works
with Emir Sadettin

27:11.108 --> 27:12.908
and makes life unbearable for us?

27:13.588 --> 27:14.988
I won't let you be alone,

27:15.988 --> 27:18.188
even if the whole world
comes down on us...

27:20.028 --> 27:21.308
let alone those two degenerates.

27:23.228 --> 27:24.908
As long as I'm alive...

27:27.868 --> 27:29.188
I'll live by this oath.

27:30.788 --> 27:31.868
Your life is mine,

27:32.788 --> 27:36.628
your blood is mine,
your oath is mine, Turgut Alp.

27:38.428 --> 27:39.508
So I'll have to...

27:40.708 --> 27:42.028
go back to my pavilion

27:42.948 --> 27:46.988
and take Dündar Bey out
of the heedlessness pit that he fell in.

27:51.388 --> 27:53.548
Don't you give in to those degenerates.

27:56.308 --> 28:01.388
You should know that
both Ertuğrul Bey's men and I

28:02.788 --> 28:03.868
will have your back.

28:33.188 --> 28:35.508
No morals or tradition is left.

28:37.788 --> 28:39.228
She won't follow my command.

28:41.108 --> 28:44.708
With Ertuğrul's scumbag by her side
she shows her teeth.

28:46.868 --> 28:49.508
If it wasn't for Emir Sadettin

28:49.988 --> 28:51.188
I'd show her...

28:51.868 --> 28:54.788
Seems like his axe won't stop
before it cuts his own throat.

28:55.308 --> 28:56.508
Give your command, Father,

28:57.228 --> 29:00.708
so I can show that scumbag's mad head
to everyone.

29:03.948 --> 29:06.548
That will happen
when the time comes, son.

29:07.188 --> 29:10.748
However, for now
you have to control your anger.

29:11.268 --> 29:12.468
You'll control it so...

29:13.868 --> 29:15.108
when the time comes...

29:16.148 --> 29:18.868
whoever can't control their hands
and their mouth

29:19.268 --> 29:20.708
will pay for what they've done.

29:22.068 --> 29:23.708
Those people have decayed, Bey.

29:25.068 --> 29:27.028
What kind of a hell are we in?

29:28.068 --> 29:30.308
I'm afraid they'll get worse
if we keep quiet.

29:35.268 --> 29:36.268
Hatun,

29:36.868 --> 29:38.428
don't you know your Bey?

29:39.068 --> 29:40.388
Don't you see what's happening?

29:43.588 --> 29:44.588
Father.

29:45.068 --> 29:48.268
How can we keep quiet just because
the Emir of the government approves this?

29:49.468 --> 29:51.828
I'd be less offended if my arm broke off.

29:53.428 --> 29:54.428
I can't stand this.

29:58.508 --> 30:00.148
Not now, Sancar.

30:00.468 --> 30:01.668
Not now.

30:05.388 --> 30:06.588
Let go of your anger.

30:07.468 --> 30:10.948
Let it go,
so it can come back as a storm.

30:23.388 --> 30:24.388
Go, ha!

30:26.708 --> 30:27.708
Come on, ha!

30:33.908 --> 30:34.908
Go!

30:51.428 --> 30:52.588
Damn you, animal!

31:02.268 --> 31:03.628
Be useful one last time.

31:04.348 --> 31:06.228
Disorient Ertuğrul for me.

31:07.748 --> 31:08.748
Come on.

31:12.708 --> 31:13.708
Go.

31:48.148 --> 31:49.948
Thank God.

31:50.708 --> 31:52.668
My God let us see you alive.

32:36.068 --> 32:39.028
Don't think you'll get away with
what you've done, Turgut Alp.

32:40.108 --> 32:41.628
My breath will always be...

32:42.508 --> 32:43.508
on your neck.

32:45.948 --> 32:47.508
I'm too tired to deal with you.

32:48.508 --> 32:52.028
Go away before your anger
gets you in trouble.

32:54.028 --> 32:56.508
I'll walk all over you, Turgut.

33:05.908 --> 33:08.548
Your father has no tongue to respond,

33:09.268 --> 33:12.068
has no hands to make someone pay...

33:14.828 --> 33:16.548
so he sends his lamb after me?

33:25.068 --> 33:27.788
That's the kind of language scumbags
like you would understand.

33:28.668 --> 33:30.628
Even if your bey comes out of his grave,

33:31.508 --> 33:32.708
he won't save you.

33:43.908 --> 33:46.188
I'll make you crawl
with my own hands, Turgut.

33:48.548 --> 33:50.308
You'll leave this pavilion crawling.

33:51.588 --> 33:52.588
Come on.

33:53.508 --> 33:54.508
Come here.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.500
Damn it.

35:27.580 --> 35:28.780
How could this happen?

35:50.700 --> 35:51.820
Where is Ertuğrul?

35:53.140 --> 35:55.220
He got away.

35:57.940 --> 36:00.220
How can a wounded man do this all alone?

36:01.420 --> 36:03.180
He wasn't alone.

36:04.380 --> 36:06.700
He created an army out of slaves.

36:07.220 --> 36:08.540
Which way did they go?

36:09.340 --> 36:10.540
Simko.

36:11.540 --> 36:13.340
Simko captured them.

36:13.940 --> 36:15.220
Which way did they go?

36:18.420 --> 36:20.300
That way.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.260
Hurry up. We're leaving.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.660
Please don't leave me here.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.740
Take me with you.

36:31.060 --> 36:32.060
Please.

37:03.140 --> 37:04.140
Enough!

37:04.700 --> 37:06.500
Turgut, Sancar Bey!

37:09.620 --> 37:11.260
How dare you?

37:12.620 --> 37:14.540
What are you looking at?

37:15.460 --> 37:18.380
Why didn't you stop him?

37:19.740 --> 37:23.100
Sancar Bey disrespected us
by punching Turgut Alp

37:23.220 --> 37:24.740
who fought by our side.

37:25.020 --> 37:26.540
Yes, he is right.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.260
Sancar Bey started it.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.060
We won't take part in this fight.

37:31.980 --> 37:34.020
No, we won't!

37:35.620 --> 37:37.100
Teach your son some manners.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.740
Or I'll teach him.

37:41.140 --> 37:42.540
Mark my words.

37:43.180 --> 37:44.060
Enough!

37:44.700 --> 37:46.820
Sancar Bey is the one without manners.

37:54.980 --> 37:55.980
Turgut Alp<i>...</i>

37:57.060 --> 37:58.700
go to your tribe in peace.

38:00.860 --> 38:04.860
All the Çavdars appreciate you
leading our alps

38:05.900 --> 38:08.180
and fighting alongside them.

38:08.740 --> 38:11.660
May you never lose a fight, Turgut Alp!

38:12.060 --> 38:15.260
May God deliver you from evil!

38:15.460 --> 38:18.660
May you never lose a fight, Turgut Alp!

38:18.780 --> 38:22.020
May God deliver you from evil!

38:22.220 --> 38:25.500
May you never lose a fight, Turgut Alp!

38:25.660 --> 38:28.900
May God deliver you from evil!

38:48.100 --> 38:51.620
Lady Aslıhan, we didn't let the enemy
take over our flag, we protected it.

39:04.820 --> 39:07.100
May God bless you, brave warriors.

39:08.140 --> 39:11.500
May God host our martyrs in his heaven.

39:12.220 --> 39:14.980
May God deliver you, our state

39:15.860 --> 39:17.900
and our homes from evil.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.620
Amen.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.500
O' Turgut.

40:23.300 --> 40:26.020
I won't have my peace

40:26.660 --> 40:28.180
until I bury you with Ertuğrul.

40:38.780 --> 40:40.140
Blessed vizier.

40:41.780 --> 40:43.860
A letter from our sultan has arrived.

40:48.940 --> 40:49.940
Read it.

41:04.900 --> 41:06.980
"You, my vizier Sadettin.

41:08.340 --> 41:12.060
If a margrave of a state,
who is destined to be glorious

41:12.900 --> 41:17.300
is ambushed and attacked,
then the responsible ones will pay.

41:18.140 --> 41:22.980
I've been waiting to hear from you
about the matter yet you've been silent.

41:24.060 --> 41:27.780
It's your responsibility
to hold them accountable.

41:28.140 --> 41:30.860
Make them pay for what they did
to my margrave at once."

41:43.460 --> 41:44.980
Blessed vizier.

41:52.020 --> 41:55.980
It's time to make the murderers
of Ertuğrul pay for their crimes.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.220
We'll let our sultan know

42:02.540 --> 42:06.540
Ares ambushed and killed Ertuğrul

42:07.740 --> 42:09.460
once Bahadir Bey takes over the bazaar.

42:32.260 --> 42:34.900
Sir, a letter from the emperor
has arrived at the castle.

42:35.020 --> 42:36.620
Your soldiers brought it here.

42:44.940 --> 42:48.700
<i>It's a smart move to be partners</i>
<i>with Vizier Sadettin in the bazaar.</i>

42:48.780 --> 42:52.420
<i>We'll send the qualified trader</i>
<i>you demanded from us.</i>

42:52.540 --> 42:55.260
<i>With his help,</i>
<i>you'll make the bazaar inoperative.</i>

42:55.900 --> 42:58.060
<i>Once the Turks are worn out</i>

42:58.140 --> 43:01.140
<i>we'll strike with our great army</i>
<i>and destroy them.</i>

43:01.300 --> 43:05.340
<i>You have the capacity and the wit</i>
<i>to do greater goods.</i>

43:05.620 --> 43:09.380
<i>Our religion and holy emperor</i>
<i>expect more from you.</i>

43:09.540 --> 43:11.300
Come on then, Ertuğrul.

43:14.420 --> 43:16.460
Let's see how you'll save yourself
this time.

44:06.500 --> 44:08.700
Horses seem to have gone that way.

44:09.300 --> 44:11.300
But this might be a trap.

44:13.780 --> 44:15.260
Just like you said, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

44:15.900 --> 44:17.460
Footprints go this way.

44:19.820 --> 44:23.100
He can't go far on foot.
Let's go after him.

44:24.300 --> 44:26.140
Get on your horses, men, this way.

44:55.780 --> 44:58.220
That's Ertuğrul. Let Commander Lukas
know right away.

45:07.060 --> 45:10.140
I wouldn't want something like this
to happen on your watch.

45:10.740 --> 45:12.420
-But...
-Relax.

45:14.380 --> 45:15.980
That Turgut will get what he deserves.

45:17.580 --> 45:19.300
He knows if he does it again

45:19.620 --> 45:22.940
that dagger will go through his heart,
not his shoulder.

45:24.820 --> 45:26.220
Relax.

45:26.500 --> 45:29.620
But, Sancar Bey<i>...</i>

45:32.340 --> 45:33.620
He is hard to contain.

45:34.500 --> 45:35.980
And Turgut is a wild one.

45:36.740 --> 45:40.420
Be careful. I wouldn't want
your only son to be harmed.

45:41.140 --> 45:44.660
If he does anything to my son,
aside from killing Turgut,

45:44.780 --> 45:46.620
I'd burn his tribe down to the ground.

45:47.740 --> 45:51.140
Quietly and smoothly.

45:54.940 --> 45:58.260
You should keep this in mind at all times.

46:02.380 --> 46:06.660
First, let Dündar be chosen as the leader
and you take Hanlı Bazaar.

46:08.620 --> 46:10.380
Then Turgut's time will come.

46:13.260 --> 46:14.340
Don't worry.

46:15.540 --> 46:19.700
I see you watching over us,
I now have worries, blessed vizier.

46:24.180 --> 46:26.060
Go to the beys of the tribe at once.

46:26.740 --> 46:30.580
As a victorious bey
who demands Hanlı Bazaar,

46:30.940 --> 46:34.340
convince them to hold a council meeting.

46:36.100 --> 46:41.740
Seeing Turgut's support,
Aslıhan will make it hard for you.

46:42.100 --> 46:43.540
Don't worry about her.

46:45.900 --> 46:52.020
Inform your beys that you have my blessing
to become the new margrave.

46:54.580 --> 46:57.820
From now on, Aslıhan shouldn't have a say
in that tribe.

46:58.780 --> 47:00.780
May God protect our state.

47:01.300 --> 47:03.340
And let you live long.

47:29.980 --> 47:31.260
Thank you, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

47:33.380 --> 47:35.740
So, Brother... Why are we still here?

47:36.100 --> 47:39.300
-Let's take our swords and gut them.
-Bamsi, enough.

47:40.180 --> 47:43.380
We already have too much on our plates.

47:44.940 --> 47:47.700
No one in the tribe will know about it
except for you.

47:48.260 --> 47:50.220
Brother, are you listening to yourself?

47:50.340 --> 47:53.180
Are we going to let the serpent
grow under our noses?

47:53.420 --> 47:56.300
We need to crush its head
before it bites all of us.

47:56.540 --> 48:00.380
Bamsi, don't you know that
the head of the serpent is Sadettin?

48:02.020 --> 48:03.780
He was the one who brought Bahadir here.

48:03.980 --> 48:06.300
He probably also has a part
in the purchase of the bazaar.

48:06.660 --> 48:10.140
They're doing all they can
to banish us from these lands.

48:11.860 --> 48:16.340
It'll be our heads that get crushed
if we don't act cautiously, Bamsi.

48:17.020 --> 48:18.940
First, we will face Dündar Bey<i>.</i>

48:19.380 --> 48:21.620
What if they choose Dündar Bey
at the council meeting?

48:22.780 --> 48:24.500
Let's decide now

48:24.700 --> 48:26.740
so we will know what to do later.

48:28.140 --> 48:31.940
We will not leave here
even if Dündar Bey is chosen.

48:34.620 --> 48:36.740
We won't leave this place

48:38.020 --> 48:41.260
until we make them pay for
what they did to Ertuğrul Bey

48:42.060 --> 48:44.100
and turn them into ashes.

48:44.220 --> 48:47.940
We won't turn our backs on these lands
nor on our bey<i>.</i>

48:52.300 --> 48:53.620
Lady Aslıhan

48:54.540 --> 48:57.940
and Çavdar's alps who supported us
are with us.

49:01.420 --> 49:02.380
We are not alone.

49:04.620 --> 49:08.540
Alps! We will do all we can
without spoiling our traditions

49:08.780 --> 49:10.060
and without opposing our state.

49:10.340 --> 49:12.660
-Very well.
-Very well.

49:12.740 --> 49:13.940
Very well, Artuk Bey.

51:37.420 --> 51:38.500
Ertuğrul.

51:42.540 --> 51:43.700
You are back?

52:33.540 --> 52:34.900
Ertuğrul.

52:38.340 --> 52:39.380
Don't leave!

52:44.940 --> 52:46.140
Don't leave, Ertuğrul.

52:47.900 --> 52:48.940
Don't!

52:50.540 --> 52:51.460
Don't.

53:02.140 --> 53:03.340
Dear God...

53:05.060 --> 53:07.180
I can't take this anymore.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.820
Please give me strength.

53:14.460 --> 53:15.740
Give me strength.

53:45.660 --> 53:49.100
You took away everything I had, Ertuğrul.

53:50.220 --> 53:52.660
I lost everything I had.

53:54.860 --> 53:57.260
You'll pay dearly for it.

53:59.820 --> 54:01.620
And Ares will get what he deserves.

54:03.700 --> 54:06.700
Thanks to you, I'll be super rich.

54:08.620 --> 54:11.900
Did you think the shadows
could conceal you, bastard?

54:16.540 --> 54:17.620
Atsiz.

54:18.980 --> 54:20.220
Let's surround him.

54:21.340 --> 54:22.820
We won't let him get away.

55:06.340 --> 55:08.340
So we meet again, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

55:10.740 --> 55:13.900
They said you were a dangerous man.

55:14.620 --> 55:15.940
I underestimated you.

55:16.620 --> 55:19.500
You haven't paid the price
for underestimating me, yet.

55:20.100 --> 55:21.380
Neither have you, Ertuğrul Bey.

55:22.380 --> 55:23.620
Neither have you.

55:24.700 --> 55:26.900
I saved your life.

55:27.820 --> 55:30.460
How easily did you forget?
You are indebted to me.

55:31.220 --> 55:33.820
What do you want in return
for saving my life?

55:37.500 --> 55:38.500
Gold.

55:40.260 --> 55:41.500
I want gold, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

55:42.540 --> 55:44.060
What else would I want?

55:45.300 --> 55:47.580
Look, let's make a deal.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.620
You give me the gold,

55:53.180 --> 55:56.620
and I'll tell you who ambushed you.

56:22.820 --> 56:25.140
Kill them all. Don't leave any alive.

58:08.780 --> 58:09.900
Simko got away.

58:10.980 --> 58:13.100
He was ready to tell everything
to save his own life.

58:15.300 --> 58:19.460
Don't worry, Atsiz. There is someone else.

58:35.660 --> 58:40.340
You shed blood in my tent
and your son didn't behave.

58:40.740 --> 58:43.300
I'm staying silent so as to not spoil
the peace within the tribe.

58:45.260 --> 58:47.460
But if you disrupt the peace again

58:47.740 --> 58:49.980
I'll have you banished
from my tribe, Bahadir Bey<i>.</i>

58:52.620 --> 58:55.460
If you summoned me here to threaten me,

58:56.300 --> 58:58.380
then know that I won't take this lightly.

58:59.940 --> 59:01.940
I came here with state's orders.

59:02.300 --> 59:05.420
No one has the power
to banish me from here.

59:05.900 --> 59:10.380
Vizier Sadettin won't be able to help,
Bahadir Bey<i>.</i>

59:11.140 --> 59:15.340
I am the leader of this tribe,
my words are the rules here.

59:15.700 --> 59:18.220
This tribe is also my tribe.

59:20.020 --> 59:23.300
And soon I'll be the leader.

59:27.100 --> 59:31.900
In the past, you supported Ertuğrul
and caused disgrace to our tribe.

59:33.380 --> 59:36.380
Now you rely on the support
of the Turgut and Kayi tribes.

59:37.220 --> 59:38.540
But it's in vain.

59:41.140 --> 59:44.580
Ertuğrul Bey followed the path
of the state and God.

59:45.740 --> 59:48.780
While it's not clear
whose path you are on.

59:52.700 --> 59:55.300
I won't leave this tribe to your hands.

00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:02.380
We'll see, Lady Aslıhan. We'll see.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.580
Neither of you will have a say here

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:10.180
once the Kayi tribe choose Dündar
as their leader.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:15.980
Let aside Turgut,
even Ertuğrul won't be able

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:21.300
to keep you as the leader
even if he were to rise from his grave.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:26.020
The door!

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.220
He is regaining consciousness.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.180
So you are awake.

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.180
Come here.

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:17.940
Come and eat some food.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:20.220
Gather your strength.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.500
You have so much to tell me.

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.580
I have nothing to say to you, Turk.

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.340
Don't be so sure.

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.340
I am in no hurry.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.300
We'll be around here

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.460
until you decide to talk.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.060
I don't know who you are.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.380
We just wanted the gold.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.580
And you happened to be poor.

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.420
It was the wrong tree.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.780
Kill me and be done with it.

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.940
Not that easily, you bastard!

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.220
Death would be an escape for you.

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.940
Now, tell me.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.060
Who sent you after me?

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.340
My men and I were looking for gold.

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.100
Don't you get it?

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.420
We saw someone by a fire.

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:28.380
You came up
just when we were about to attack him.

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.580
Who sent you after me?

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.460
I swear in Jesus' name.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.100
I don't know you.

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.460
I told you, we were after the gold.

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:44.340
Simko wanted to sell me for gold.
Who is your master?

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.740
Who sent you
and Simko to kill me, tell me!

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.780
I swear I don't know.

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.140
I don't understand what you are saying.

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.700
My decision is final.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.300
The bazaar will be sold
to a brave Turkish bey

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.260
who has the support of vizier Sadettin.

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:47.100
And then I will unite our tribe
with Gündoğdu

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:49.060
and Sungurtekin's tribes.

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:52.340
Well thought, Dündar Bey<i>.</i>

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.220
-That's the appropriate thing to do.
-He is right.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.380
It's for the best.

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.500
-It's for the best.
-It's for the best.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.620
What about Artuk Bey's direction?

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:08.580
My direction includes patience,
effort and our religion.

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:13.140
I'd like to keep
Ertuğrul Bey's cause alive.

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.300
<i>Right.</i>

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:17.260
No good can come
from digressing from Ertuğrul Bey's path.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:20.420
There would only be bad things.

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:23.580
-He is right.
-Right.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:28.740
<i>-</i>Artuk Bey is right.
-He speaks the truth.

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.300
This is a place
for consultation, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:35.980
Words like these are not suitable
for a man of your wisdom.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:42.700
Ertuğrul Bey<i>'s</i> blood is running
through my veins.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.580
He is right.

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.460
Who can follow his path better than I can?

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:54.660
Dündar Bey<i>, </i>you're suggesting
we leave all our efforts behind.

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.940
This is not about Ertuğrul Bey<i>'</i>s path
or about bravery.

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.060
That's correct. He is right.

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.900
-We can't let that happen.
-My beys!

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.660
My beys<i>...</i>

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.500
Both Artuk Bey and Dündar Bey

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:21.780
revealed their directions.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:27.260
It's up to you to decide now.

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:33.060
May the best decision
for our tribe be made.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:35.780
Amen. May it be for the best.

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:40.020
Hopefully, it'll be for the best.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.060
Go to hell, Ertuğrul!

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.460
Good.

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.140
So you know my name.

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.460
Are you still going to deny knowing me?

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:32.340
I killed all the soldiers
who served your master

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.700
and sent a message to him with pigeons.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.500
And he sent you to me, right?

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:43.020
Where did the pigeons go?

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.980
Whose place was it?

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:53.340
Nothing will come out of my mouth
except for blood, Ertuğrul.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.180
So, you are loyal to your master, huh?

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.020
Let's see how loyal you are.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:15.900
Loyal dog, you'll talk!

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.700
I won't talk
even if you kill me, Ertuğrul.

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:39.260
Stop it!

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.220
You will talk! Who sent you?

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.220
Ares!

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.660
Commander Ares.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.900
He'll be the death of you
and all the other Turks.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:14.260
He'll slay all the women and children

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.460
just like he ambushed you
and slayed your warriors.

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:24.620
You'll all be erased from these lands.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:31.500
I'll burn down the Karacahisar Castle

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:34.620
with your master in it.

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.260
I'll make these lands a grave

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.580
for those who even think

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.460
about erasing Turks from these lands.

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.260
All in favor of Artuk Bey
being the leader of the Kayi?

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:52.260
All in favor of Dündar Bey
being the leader of the Kayi?

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.900
The council has decided.

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:20.780
Dündar Bey will be the leader of the Kayi.

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:26.460
From now on, Dündar Bey will lead us

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.500
with his decisions.

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:33.420
May it be the best for our tribe.

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.860
So be it.

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:40.380
May it be for the best.

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.780
May it be for the best, beys<i>.</i>

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:45.700
May it be the best for all of us.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.100
May it be beneficial.

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:54.300
-May it be the best for our tribe, my Bey.
-Thanks.

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:57.260
-Good luck, Dündar Bey.
-Do you have anything to say, Artuk Bey<i>?</i>

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:05.620
You'll be governed as you deserve.

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.260
We shall see.

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:36.180
-Good luck, Son.
-Thank you, Mother.

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.620
Good luck, Dündar Bey<i>.</i>

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:48.980
May it be beneficial.

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:51.980
May it be beneficial for all of us.

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:55.980
I grant every tent a sheep
as a token of my leadership.

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.300
Thank you, my bey<i>.</i>

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:00.180
The inn will be sold

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:04.380
and in no time
the Kayi tribe will be reunited again.

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.940
Let it be known to everyone.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:10.300
Good luck, my bey<i>.</i>

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.060
Appreciate it.

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.700
Atsiz, let's be on our way.

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.780
Ares has probably already taken advantage
of my absence.

01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.580
We have no time to lose.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.672
You've revealed everything, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.180
What's your next move?

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:29.460
Now, it's our right to conquer.

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.260
I'll cut off Ares' head
and send it to the emperor.

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:39.500
I will burn the Karacahisar Castle
to the ground if that's what it takes.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:43.620
Then I'll sneak into the castle
and gather information for you.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:48.100
Know that, Ertuğrul Bey,
I'll be with you till my last breath.

01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:51.660
I appreciate it, Atsiz.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.300
Brave warriors, go to IlBeyi at once.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.500
Let him know Ertuğrul Bey is on his way,
safe and sound.

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:44.260
What is it? Are they here?

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:48.100
No, sir, we're still watching the roads.
Nobody has arrived yet.

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:59.420
Eventually, they both will come here.
I will gut them both.

01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.060
You go back to your post!

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:04.780
Let me know as soon as
you see them coming. Right away!

01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:06.380
Yes, Sir.

01:15:20.788 --> 01:15:25.668
Soon, the Kayi tribe will
only be history in these lands.

01:15:26.828 --> 01:15:29.628
Our fortune has been served to us
on a silver platter.

01:15:30.588 --> 01:15:34.588
We'll rise once again as the Cavdar tribe.

01:15:35.228 --> 01:15:36.788
Thank you, my bey.

01:15:48.988 --> 01:15:51.548
-Wow...
-Holy...

01:15:52.308 --> 01:15:55.068
-What is this?
-It's a gold chest!

01:15:56.828 --> 01:16:00.268
Useless men talk in vain,

01:16:00.588 --> 01:16:05.348
real men show off their power.

01:16:06.948 --> 01:16:08.508
I'll purchase the bazaar

01:16:08.708 --> 01:16:11.508
and make this tribe
the richest Turkish tribe.

01:16:11.628 --> 01:16:12.668
Hopefully.

01:16:12.748 --> 01:16:17.828
We'll be glorious with our goods,
army and properties.

01:16:18.548 --> 01:16:22.268
-We believe in you, Bahadir Bey.
-When will you purchase the bazaar?

01:16:23.228 --> 01:16:25.188
I'm waiting to hear from the Kayi tribe.

01:16:26.908 --> 01:16:29.188
Once Dündar Bey is elected as the leader

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.348
I'll purchase the bazaar.

01:16:32.308 --> 01:16:36.108
<i>-May I come in?</i>
-Come in.

01:16:41.228 --> 01:16:45.308
I have news from the Kayi tribe, my bey.
The council made a decision.

01:16:45.948 --> 01:16:49.108
Dündar Bey has been elected
as the new leader of Kayi tribe.

01:17:00.828 --> 01:17:03.828
Now, the time has come for us.

01:17:04.388 --> 01:17:07.948
I'll do my part and purchase the bazaar.

01:17:09.268 --> 01:17:11.548
You should play your part

01:17:12.388 --> 01:17:15.028
and demand a council meeting right away.

01:17:15.588 --> 01:17:17.148
Very well, my <i>bey.</i>

01:17:19.628 --> 01:17:23.908
It's time to shake heathen's lands
with our raids,

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:28.508
it's time
to wave our flag in hostile lands,

01:17:29.348 --> 01:17:33.828
it's time to be the richest tribe.

01:17:36.748 --> 01:17:39.388
Now make your decision.

01:17:40.468 --> 01:17:42.668
Would you rather be on Lady Aslıhan's side

01:17:43.708 --> 01:17:46.348
and keep on goofing around in the tribe?

01:17:47.708 --> 01:17:52.868
Or would you rather be with me
and spread our glory everywhere?

01:17:55.828 --> 01:17:56.948
Of course.

01:17:57.228 --> 01:17:58.988
Let's spread our glory.

01:17:59.988 --> 01:18:01.948
That's what I thought.

01:19:15.228 --> 01:19:18.348
Our Bey is coming. Here comes Dündar Bey.

01:19:31.908 --> 01:19:34.308
With the permission of God,

01:19:35.068 --> 01:19:36.868
I have the responsibility

01:19:37.548 --> 01:19:39.868
to carry our customs, traditions

01:19:40.388 --> 01:19:42.668
and memories of our martyrs

01:19:43.628 --> 01:19:45.308
to the future, now.

01:19:46.028 --> 01:19:47.948
He is right. He is the leader now.

01:19:48.228 --> 01:19:50.748
Long live Dündar Bey!

01:19:54.348 --> 01:19:55.588
First order of business,

01:19:55.908 --> 01:19:57.228
I will sell the bazaar

01:19:57.588 --> 01:20:00.508
to a brave Turkish bey

01:20:01.148 --> 01:20:03.028
for a very good price.

01:20:03.468 --> 01:20:06.388
What! How come?

01:20:07.828 --> 01:20:09.908
You cannot sell the bazaar!

01:20:10.348 --> 01:20:12.268
We won't let that happen!

01:20:12.588 --> 01:20:14.948
How can he do that?

01:20:15.068 --> 01:20:17.828
Dündar Bey!

01:20:23.948 --> 01:20:25.788
When did we ever

01:20:26.308 --> 01:20:31.468
sell something for which we shed blood?
Why would we do it now?

01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:34.588
When did we ever...

01:20:35.708 --> 01:20:38.548
forgot the memories of our martyrs

01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:42.268
and run away without looking back?
And why would we do it now?

01:20:42.428 --> 01:20:44.308
Know your place, Bamsi!

01:20:45.068 --> 01:20:46.548
Know your place!

01:20:57.988 --> 01:21:00.868
We are not running away from anyone.

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:02.388
Then...

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:07.708
why are we selling the bazaar in a hurry
and leaving our land?

01:21:08.428 --> 01:21:09.788
Why the hurry?

01:21:10.468 --> 01:21:12.628
What about Ertuğrul Bey's revenge?

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:29.628
Since when did you start
to question the bey's orders, Turgut?

01:21:33.428 --> 01:21:34.748
You have the right to rule.

01:21:35.428 --> 01:21:36.708
And we deeply respect

01:21:37.588 --> 01:21:39.348
our traditions and customs.

01:21:40.548 --> 01:21:43.708
But know this, Dündar Bey...

01:21:45.028 --> 01:21:49.308
We won't turn our backs on these lands

01:21:49.628 --> 01:21:51.508
for which we lost many good men!

01:21:51.588 --> 01:21:54.388
We won't!

01:21:54.508 --> 01:21:55.668
And of course,

01:21:55.868 --> 01:21:59.308
we won't go anywhere
without avenging Ertuğrul Bey's death.

01:21:59.548 --> 01:22:01.228
We won't!

01:22:24.588 --> 01:22:26.348
Our path is clear.

01:22:28.508 --> 01:22:30.068
I will not change my decision.

01:22:31.508 --> 01:22:33.348
If you disobey our traditions

01:22:33.988 --> 01:22:36.068
and oppose your leader's decisions

01:22:36.788 --> 01:22:38.228
then you can go your own way.

01:22:49.988 --> 01:22:53.108
Is this how you respect
your brother and his memory?

01:23:03.388 --> 01:23:06.228
-Will the tribe be divided now?
-We can't go anywhere without alps.

01:23:08.788 --> 01:23:11.228
We won't leave our tribe!

01:24:31.588 --> 01:24:33.988
You entered my tent without permission

01:24:34.348 --> 01:24:36.348
and sat in my spot!

01:24:36.868 --> 01:24:38.868
Move away right now, Bahadir Bey!

01:24:39.428 --> 01:24:40.508
Right now!

01:24:45.068 --> 01:24:48.348
I'm not here to argue with you,
Lady Aslıhan.

01:24:50.708 --> 01:24:51.948
The Kayi tribe

01:24:52.428 --> 01:24:54.188
has elected Dündar as their leader.

01:24:57.628 --> 01:24:58.788
Now,

01:24:59.508 --> 01:25:01.188
I'm on my way to buy the bazaar.

01:25:02.468 --> 01:25:04.948
I talked to all the beys of Cavdar.

01:25:05.868 --> 01:25:07.388
They all obeyed me.

01:25:09.548 --> 01:25:11.708
You can't avoid it any longer.

01:25:13.268 --> 01:25:14.948
The ruler of the Cavdar tribe

01:25:15.628 --> 01:25:18.548
will be changed by tomorrow.

01:25:19.348 --> 01:25:23.588
Everyone will bow before me.

01:25:27.908 --> 01:25:32.828
Do what I asked last time
and call for a council meeting.

01:25:37.908 --> 01:25:39.188
The door!

01:25:47.668 --> 01:25:49.428
What happened, Lady Aslıhan?

01:25:50.028 --> 01:25:53.028
Lady Esma, prepare the alps.

01:25:53.588 --> 01:25:55.388
We're going to the Kayi Tribe.

01:26:07.508 --> 01:26:09.508
I'll not let the coyotes roam freely

01:26:09.868 --> 01:26:12.708
in the absence of the lions, Aliyar Bey.

01:26:14.468 --> 01:26:19.268
I swear to God, I'll resist
until I take my last breath.

01:26:24.148 --> 01:26:27.988
Blessed vizier, this is a sword
from Damascus, made by a master.

01:26:34.468 --> 01:26:35.508
Nice.

01:26:53.788 --> 01:26:54.948
Nice.

01:26:55.028 --> 01:26:57.868
Dündar deserved this.

01:27:01.388 --> 01:27:03.028
Well done, Dündar.

01:27:03.748 --> 01:27:06.188
He did everything
and has become the new leader.

01:27:06.508 --> 01:27:11.468
He shouldn't be worried.
I'll always be with him.

01:27:13.828 --> 01:27:15.908
I'll always be with him

01:27:16.828 --> 01:27:18.948
so that he can kill two birds
with only one stone.

01:27:29.148 --> 01:27:31.428
He will get rid of the Kayi tribe...

01:27:33.708 --> 01:27:35.068
and Ares.

01:27:36.388 --> 01:27:38.228
<i>What else can Sadettin do?</i>

01:27:39.548 --> 01:27:41.348
The life is going on, Ertuğrul.

01:27:42.108 --> 01:27:43.228
See.

01:27:44.828 --> 01:27:46.508
I don't speak in vain.

01:27:47.068 --> 01:27:49.468
The wisdom will prevail.

01:27:56.588 --> 01:27:58.868
Your time will come, Lady Aslıhan.

01:28:01.868 --> 01:28:04.028
Your time will come.

01:28:26.828 --> 01:28:30.508
I won't let you be the first and worst
defeat of my life, Ertuğrul.

01:28:38.428 --> 01:28:41.268
-What is it?
-News from Dündar Bey.

01:28:41.388 --> 01:28:44.028
-What about him?
-He has been elected as the leader.

01:28:45.548 --> 01:28:50.468
So they will sell the bazaar today.
Right on time, damn it!

01:28:50.628 --> 01:28:53.868
He invites you as the witness
of the Greek traders.

01:28:53.948 --> 01:28:55.708
I can't go anywhere

01:28:55.828 --> 01:28:58.148
without killing Simko and Ertuğrul.
Any news from Lukas?

01:28:58.308 --> 01:28:59.548
Not yet.

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:02.988
They will come. They'll both come.
Stay alert.

01:29:03.228 --> 01:29:04.348
Yes, sir.

01:29:10.908 --> 01:29:13.908
Lord almighty, help me.

01:29:15.228 --> 01:29:18.748
Let me see my enemy
so that I can finish what I've started.

01:29:58.308 --> 01:29:59.468
Give me your blessing, Atsız.

01:29:59.548 --> 01:30:01.228
You have it, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:30:01.308 --> 01:30:05.228
We will not rest until we get rid
of the enemy's swamp of evil.

01:30:05.908 --> 01:30:09.188
Now it's time to draw swords

01:30:09.988 --> 01:30:13.708
and wave the flags of conquering.

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:15.788
I'm always with you, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:30:16.268 --> 01:30:18.228
I'll be your eyes and ears in the castle.

01:30:18.308 --> 01:30:20.788
I'll be with you till we wave our flag
upon that castle.

01:30:21.068 --> 01:30:22.348
Thank you.

01:30:22.668 --> 01:30:27.108
We will drain the swamp of evil
in the name of God.

01:30:27.228 --> 01:30:30.548
Hopefully, Ertuğrul Bey<i>. </i>May God help us.

01:30:30.868 --> 01:30:32.028
Thank you.

01:30:32.788 --> 01:30:34.228
Be safe, Atsız.

01:30:34.308 --> 01:30:35.348
You too, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:30:35.628 --> 01:30:37.108
Farewell, then.

01:30:50.908 --> 01:30:52.748
You see, Aktolgali?

01:30:54.428 --> 01:30:57.548
We ran across vast lands.

01:30:59.148 --> 01:31:02.228
We swam across powerful rivers.

01:31:03.388 --> 01:31:06.108
We lost so many lives.

01:31:09.108 --> 01:31:12.548
Yet we failed to overcome
the traps of devils.

01:31:17.028 --> 01:31:21.108
We made the brutes beg for mercy.

01:31:22.388 --> 01:31:25.148
Yet we failed to guide
someone of our own blood.

01:31:26.588 --> 01:31:29.468
Your heart is bigger than ours, Aktolgali.

01:31:30.908 --> 01:31:34.668
Go, be on your way. Meet with your peers.

01:31:35.308 --> 01:31:37.028
Run freely on the mountains.

01:31:38.428 --> 01:31:41.548
Don't stay in this hole.

01:31:50.188 --> 01:31:53.868
He is a relic from my Ertuğrul,
my daughter.

01:31:57.508 --> 01:32:00.908
Why are you trying
to end everything, Halime?

01:32:02.108 --> 01:32:05.988
What ended is the efforts
and endeavors of Ertuğrul, mother.

01:32:08.388 --> 01:32:11.308
Many powerful storms failed
to destroy his tree.

01:32:12.868 --> 01:32:15.988
Yet his own brother took it away
from its roots.

01:32:19.588 --> 01:32:21.908
Don't you feel bad, mother?

01:32:22.268 --> 01:32:24.308
Don't you think of Ertuğrul?

01:32:29.748 --> 01:32:31.908
I feel so bad...

01:32:33.668 --> 01:32:35.228
and it's so excruciating...

01:32:39.708 --> 01:32:43.468
Words are not enough to describe.

01:32:44.108 --> 01:32:48.988
I still wait for his return,
yet I know he won't come back.

01:32:50.028 --> 01:32:53.468
I sometimes see him

01:32:54.548 --> 01:32:57.548
rearing up Aktolgali in front of our tent.

01:33:00.628 --> 01:33:04.628
And then, every now and then he says,

01:33:05.468 --> 01:33:07.588
"Don't go, mother," in my dreams.

01:33:09.388 --> 01:33:13.468
"Don't go. Don't leave me here."

01:33:13.628 --> 01:33:15.268
Then don't go, mother.

01:33:15.508 --> 01:33:16.748
Stay here.

01:33:16.868 --> 01:33:18.908
Let's get revenge for Ertuğrul <i>Bey.</i>

01:33:21.068 --> 01:33:23.628
Let's see what happens, my Halime.

01:33:25.948 --> 01:33:29.028
We need to be patient, my girl.

01:33:30.348 --> 01:33:31.948
Aktolgali shouldn't stay here.

01:33:35.028 --> 01:33:39.188
He should go meet with his peers.

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:41.548
Let's not keep him here.

01:33:42.348 --> 01:33:45.948
So that he won't have to witness
the derogation we are in.

01:34:50.108 --> 01:34:51.348
My boy!

01:34:52.468 --> 01:34:54.188
My boy!

01:36:22.308 --> 01:36:25.308
Welcome, blessed vizier.
What a nice surprise.

01:36:25.468 --> 01:36:28.468
Welcome, Bahadir Bey and Sancar Bey.

01:36:28.988 --> 01:36:32.228
Thank you, Dündar Bey,
the leader of the Kayi tribe.

01:36:33.668 --> 01:36:35.308
Congratulations.

01:36:35.468 --> 01:36:37.188
With God's permission,

01:36:37.308 --> 01:36:39.868
I'll serve for the good of our state,
blessed vizier.

01:36:47.228 --> 01:36:50.748
God bless your council
and may your leadership be glorious.

01:36:51.388 --> 01:36:55.588
And may your home be prosperous.

01:36:56.508 --> 01:37:00.228
In the name of the state,
I acknowledge your leadership

01:37:00.988 --> 01:37:03.708
and approve its legitimacy.

01:37:22.668 --> 01:37:24.188
Thank you, blessed vizier.

01:37:25.388 --> 01:37:26.508
Thank you.

01:37:26.948 --> 01:37:28.948
May God help you, Dündar Bey.

01:37:29.468 --> 01:37:30.828
May you be glorious.

01:37:31.908 --> 01:37:33.308
I appreciate it.

01:37:34.748 --> 01:37:35.988
Please.

01:37:37.748 --> 01:37:39.028
Why is Ares not here?

01:37:39.108 --> 01:37:40.548
We don't know, sir.

01:38:31.388 --> 01:38:32.388
Aktolgali?

01:39:09.468 --> 01:39:10.628
My Aktolgali.

01:39:13.828 --> 01:39:16.748
So you were looking for me
to return, huh?

01:39:19.028 --> 01:39:20.548
I wouldn't call you "brother".

01:39:21.268 --> 01:39:23.308
You are way more precious to me.

01:39:25.868 --> 01:39:27.428
We are back together now.

01:39:28.708 --> 01:39:30.628
Those who did this to us
failed to become successful.

01:39:31.548 --> 01:39:35.628
Now it's time to catch those bastards.

01:39:36.148 --> 01:39:40.268
We will go through the enemy lines
together again.

01:39:43.028 --> 01:39:48.908
Our prophet said, "True happiness
is on the back of a horse."

01:39:49.748 --> 01:39:53.388
My true happiness is to be with my tribe.

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:58.028
Now you shall be my wings...

01:39:59.028 --> 01:40:01.108
and take me to my true happiness.

01:41:21.268 --> 01:41:22.428
Antheus?

01:41:25.228 --> 01:41:26.588
Antheus?

01:42:03.988 --> 01:42:05.228
Where is Ertuğrul, Simko?

01:42:07.668 --> 01:42:09.308
I asked you a question.

01:42:09.468 --> 01:42:14.068
You and me,
we failed to get rid of one Turk.

01:42:16.748 --> 01:42:18.148
But it seems...

01:42:19.148 --> 01:42:20.868
he will get rid of us both.

01:42:31.988 --> 01:42:35.188
How did Ertuğrul escape
from his chains, Simko?

01:42:35.908 --> 01:42:38.308
A couple of Turks attacked us.

01:42:38.588 --> 01:42:40.668
They killed all my men.

01:42:40.828 --> 01:42:43.188
And saved Ertuğrul.

01:42:43.988 --> 01:42:45.668
I barely made it out of there alive.

01:42:45.948 --> 01:42:47.788
He is probably on his way to his tribe.

01:42:47.988 --> 01:42:51.988
I swear I don't know anything else.
How did you find me here?

01:42:52.468 --> 01:42:55.708
Marya told me everything, Simko,

01:42:56.228 --> 01:42:59.468
how you used your brothers,
I know everything.

01:43:00.308 --> 01:43:01.588
Marya.

01:43:02.588 --> 01:43:04.268
Poor girl.

01:43:06.188 --> 01:43:08.548
But it's you I pity most,
do you know that, Ares?

01:43:10.228 --> 01:43:13.588
You have made such a great enemy
that neither your troops

01:43:13.788 --> 01:43:16.588
nor your emperor will be able to save you!

01:43:17.028 --> 01:43:19.988
Ertuğrul is coming for you, Ares!

01:43:20.428 --> 01:43:22.668
He is coming for you!

01:43:34.828 --> 01:43:35.868
Commander.

01:43:36.388 --> 01:43:37.588
Get ready.

01:43:37.788 --> 01:43:39.628
We're going to take over the bazaar.

01:43:39.908 --> 01:43:41.668
Yes, sir.

01:45:47.868 --> 01:45:49.468
<i>May I come in?</i>

01:45:52.228 --> 01:45:53.228
Come in, my daughter.

01:46:02.788 --> 01:46:05.908
-Welcome.
-Thank you, mother.

01:46:06.388 --> 01:46:08.988
-Welcome, Aslıhan.
-Halime...

01:46:15.028 --> 01:46:17.188
Firstly, congratulations
on the council decision.

01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:19.148
Thank you, my daughter.

01:46:20.948 --> 01:46:22.468
What is going to happen now?

01:46:22.628 --> 01:46:24.428
Will you leave these lands, Mother?

01:46:27.628 --> 01:46:29.268
It's not yet clear, my daughter.

01:46:30.268 --> 01:46:33.428
It'll be decided when the time comes.

01:46:34.788 --> 01:46:37.028
You are always welcome in my tribe.

01:46:37.908 --> 01:46:39.708
I talked to Turgut Alp.

01:46:40.308 --> 01:46:45.268
He is sure he'll stay here
with the alps even if you leave.

01:46:45.868 --> 01:46:47.668
Why don't you all stay?

01:46:48.548 --> 01:46:50.748
I'd be an honor to host you in my tribe.

01:46:51.508 --> 01:46:53.268
We'll be stronger together.

01:46:54.308 --> 01:46:57.348
-Thank you, Lady Aslıhan.
-Thank you.

01:47:29.348 --> 01:47:30.228
What is it?

01:47:30.628 --> 01:47:34.628
It must be someone important
because of the sound of the drums.

01:47:44.468 --> 01:47:47.628
-What is going on?
-Someone is coming.

01:47:55.548 --> 01:47:58.748
-There's a horseman.
-Someone is there.

01:47:58.868 --> 01:48:00.948
-What is going on?
-I wonder who it is.

01:48:03.268 --> 01:48:06.388
Come, let's have a look.

01:48:06.868 --> 01:48:08.148
<i>I can't see him.</i>

01:48:10.308 --> 01:48:13.508
<i>-Let's see who he is.</i>
<i>-Come on.</i>

01:48:17.788 --> 01:48:19.788
Our Ertuğrul Bey is coming!

01:48:32.628 --> 01:48:33.868
Mother.

01:49:17.508 --> 01:49:18.468
Mother.

01:49:27.388 --> 01:49:28.908
Ertuğrul!

01:49:35.388 --> 01:49:37.388
Goodness gracious! Our bey is alive!

01:49:37.468 --> 01:49:40.948
Good God! He is back. Thank God!

01:49:42.268 --> 01:49:44.188
Thank God.

01:49:48.388 --> 01:49:50.468
Oh, thank God.

01:50:21.468 --> 01:50:22.788
Our bey is alive.

01:50:42.988 --> 01:50:44.268
Dad!

01:50:49.908 --> 01:50:51.828
Dad! I knew you'd come back.

01:50:51.908 --> 01:50:53.828
Oh, my lion.

01:50:54.388 --> 01:50:55.868
Oh, my boy.

01:51:14.468 --> 01:51:18.188
Long live my bey! God spared you for us!

01:51:18.268 --> 01:51:19.428
Oh, my brave boy.

01:51:19.988 --> 01:51:23.668
Amen. Thank God!

01:51:28.748 --> 01:51:30.108
Either I'm dead...

01:51:31.788 --> 01:51:33.548
or you are resurrected, Ertuğrul.

01:51:34.308 --> 01:51:35.788
Neither. You aren't dead...

01:51:36.228 --> 01:51:37.988
nor am I resurrected, my Halime.

01:51:42.988 --> 01:51:46.228
I ruined the enemy's traps and came back.

01:52:26.588 --> 01:52:29.228
-Welcome.
-Thank you, my Halime.

01:52:34.588 --> 01:52:35.548
Mother.

01:52:48.268 --> 01:52:49.348
My mother.

01:52:50.828 --> 01:52:53.228
Son...

01:52:56.468 --> 01:52:58.148
My son.

01:53:10.788 --> 01:53:12.068
My lion.

01:53:32.668 --> 01:53:33.748
My mother.

01:53:34.668 --> 01:53:35.748
My son.

01:53:36.788 --> 01:53:38.468
My son.

01:53:41.788 --> 01:53:44.468
Welcome Ertuğrul Bey.
Thank God you are back.

01:53:44.948 --> 01:53:46.148
Thank you, Lady Aslıhan.

01:54:00.068 --> 01:54:01.148
Brother.

01:54:01.228 --> 01:54:02.348
My bey.

01:54:02.708 --> 01:54:04.428
Good man.

01:54:06.228 --> 01:54:07.788
Brother.

01:54:13.708 --> 01:54:15.308
Thank God, my bey.

01:54:15.428 --> 01:54:16.708
My brave brother.

01:54:16.788 --> 01:54:18.068
Good man.

01:54:21.868 --> 01:54:24.868
Thank God, my bey.

01:54:24.988 --> 01:54:26.308
Artuk Bey.

01:54:33.668 --> 01:54:36.228
Bring it in, alps. Come here! Hey!

01:54:36.468 --> 01:54:39.348
My lions! Oh my lions!

01:54:39.948 --> 01:54:42.748
-Welcome my bey.
-Good men.

01:54:42.828 --> 01:54:46.188
-Good men.
-Oh, God, thank you.

01:54:46.348 --> 01:54:50.868
-Lions, my lions!
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:54:54.668 --> 01:54:55.828
Bamsi...

01:54:57.628 --> 01:54:58.788
My Bamsi.

01:54:59.508 --> 01:55:02.428
Oh, my brother. Good man.

01:55:03.228 --> 01:55:04.868
-My lion.
-My bey.

01:55:04.948 --> 01:55:07.268
-My lion.
-My bey, forgive me.

01:55:07.388 --> 01:55:09.828
Forgive me, my bey.

01:55:10.108 --> 01:55:12.548
I failed to protect you, my bey.

01:55:12.668 --> 01:55:14.388
Forgive me, my bey.

01:55:14.708 --> 01:55:15.868
-My bey...
-You...

01:55:15.988 --> 01:55:18.068
I caused you
to be separated from your loved ones.

01:55:18.188 --> 01:55:19.748
Forgive me, my bey.

01:55:20.028 --> 01:55:22.268
You did all you could, Bamsi.

01:55:22.748 --> 01:55:26.028
You made yourself a shield for me.
You got wounded.

01:55:29.028 --> 01:55:30.588
Good man.

01:55:30.828 --> 01:55:32.668
Oh, good man.

01:55:33.708 --> 01:55:35.588
My bey.

01:55:36.148 --> 01:55:40.188
I wish I had died instead of you.

01:55:40.388 --> 01:55:45.148
So these things wouldn't have happened
to the tribe.

01:55:46.388 --> 01:55:47.708
What are you saying, Bamsi?

01:55:52.668 --> 01:55:54.348
What happened?

01:56:00.268 --> 01:56:01.628
Where is Dündar?

01:56:08.388 --> 01:56:09.468
Son.

01:56:10.548 --> 01:56:14.148
Our economy wasn't doing well
when we lost you.

01:56:17.108 --> 01:56:18.788
Dündar became the leader.

01:56:20.828 --> 01:56:24.988
He decided to sell the bazaar

01:56:25.588 --> 01:56:27.988
and reunite with his brothers, Gündoğdu

01:56:28.508 --> 01:56:31.028
and Sungurtekin's tribes.

01:56:34.548 --> 01:56:35.788
What are you saying, Mother?

01:56:44.628 --> 01:56:46.508
Where is Dündar now?

01:56:47.548 --> 01:56:51.668
He went to sell the bazaar
before we leave these lands, my bey.

01:56:57.028 --> 01:56:59.268
-Dündar!
-Dad.

01:56:59.508 --> 01:57:01.068
Don't go without your sword.

01:57:05.108 --> 01:57:06.308
Thank you.

01:57:07.228 --> 01:57:08.428
Thank you, my boy.

01:57:10.428 --> 01:57:13.028
Son, go and save our bazaar.

01:57:13.188 --> 01:57:14.628
Be quick, son.

01:57:16.908 --> 01:57:18.388
Come on, alps.

01:57:18.468 --> 01:57:19.788
To the bazaar.

01:57:31.668 --> 01:57:34.268
It seems coyotes run wild

01:57:34.868 --> 01:57:36.908
when they get the chance.

01:57:37.548 --> 01:57:38.828
Let it be known...

01:57:39.668 --> 01:57:41.468
Coyotes rule...

01:57:42.308 --> 01:57:45.668
only until the wolves come back!

01:57:49.388 --> 01:57:51.508
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:57:51.668 --> 01:57:53.148
