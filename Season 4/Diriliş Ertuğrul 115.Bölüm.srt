1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Episode 115 will start after 12:07 min.

2
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:27,762
What do you want?

3
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:29,322
Step aside.

4
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,442
We need to talk to the Sultan.

5
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:35,922
What do you mean?

6
00:12:36,082 --> 00:12:37,882
What would the Sultan be doing
among our tribe?

7
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:50,442
Traitors!

8
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:51,882
God is good!

9
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,602
I hope nothing is wrong.

10
00:12:58,122 --> 00:12:59,602
Who are they, Artuk Bey<i>?</i>

11
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:01,842
God is good!

12
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:20,482
What's going on, Artuk Bey<i>?</i>

13
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:26,242
I have a bad feeling
about this, my Sultan.

14
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:44,482
-They will kill my son.
-Lady Mahperi.

15
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:46,002
-Stop.
-I can't.

16
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,562
He is pointing his sword
at my son. I can't stop.

17
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:02,242
Do you know what I see
when I look at you, Ertuğrul Bey<i>?</i>

18
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:07,042
A liar disguised as a valiant man.

19
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,522
Now surrender yourself.

20
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:17,322
Ask for the mercy of Vizier Sadettin
as they go on their raid.

21
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:22,602
We only surrender ourselves
to God, Günalp Bey<i>.</i>

22
00:14:38,882 --> 00:14:39,882
Then...

23
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:46,122
you came of your own will
to meet your death, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

24
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:48,642
I'll be your executioner.

25
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:52,362
This will be a holy day for many brave men
who sacrificed their lives

26
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:55,082
for the state.

27
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:02,842
I pray to God
to give you a little bit of sense.

28
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:06,162
Just know that,

29
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,482
I won't stop
until that bastard Sadettin dies.

30
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:13,962
Now...

31
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:18,842
Give me your best shot.

32
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:24,802
Then it's the end of the road for you.

33
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:09,402
You fools! How dare you raid
the tent of the Sultan!

34
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:10,962
You will die now.

35
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:13,322
-Attack!
-God is good!

36
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:22,762
Lady Mahperi, we need to defend
this place.

37
00:16:23,962 --> 00:16:26,482
Mother, bring us the swords.

38
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:31,202
If they try to come here,
we will protect the babies.

39
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:33,482
Give me a sword too, Lady Hayme.

40
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:34,682
Give me any weapon.

41
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:36,842
I'll do my best to defend this place.

42
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:53,522
God is good!

43
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,522
Artuk Bey!

44
00:17:12,522 --> 00:17:14,802
I know you very well, Ertuğrul <i>Bey.</i>

45
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,602
I knew you wouldn't stop
chasing Vizier Sadettin.

46
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,122
Günalp Bey<i>.</i>

47
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,642
Blessed Vizier.

48
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:45,682
Günalp. Why did you use
the secret passage to the tent?

49
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:48,202
Ertuğrul is coming after you.

50
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:51,722
Günalp Bey. He can't possibly come

51
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:54,202
to a military headquarter
with thousands of soldiers in it.

52
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,042
He will surely come.

53
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,242
Günalp is right.

54
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:00,162
Then, we should double the precautions.

55
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:01,482
No, we won't.

56
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:03,522
We will leave them as they are.

57
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:07,162
Let Ertuğrul come to kill me.

58
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:11,042
It won't be possible for him to kill you
if you go for the raid tomorrow.

59
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:14,802
But he will find a way to infiltrate
the tent tonight.

60
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:18,562
He won't even wait for the night.

61
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:21,562
He will come at an unexpected time.

62
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:25,562
Blessed Vizier...

63
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:29,402
I have unfinished business with him.

64
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:31,722
Let me be the one to welcome him.

65
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:39,802
I'm proud of your loyalty
and determination, Günalp.

66
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:11,682
Come on, my Bey<i>.</i>

67
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,002
Kill that bastard already.

68
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:17,882
Ertuğrul will come out once he is done.

69
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:20,122
We should get him

70
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:23,002
out of here safe and sound.

71
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:28,442
Husamettin, who will take over
once Sadettin dies, will handle the rest.

72
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:30,522
God willing.

73
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:32,362
God willing.

74
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:57,402
What's going on?

75
00:19:58,442 --> 00:19:59,842
Why are the soldiers here?

76
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:07,122
Bring them to me!

77
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:28,682
Who sent you?

78
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:30,442
Who?

79
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,202
He handed over his weapon
before entering the tent.

80
00:20:57,402 --> 00:20:58,602
Blessed Vizier...

81
00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:01,962
Günalp Bey should have already been out
with Ertuğrul's head in his hand.

82
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:04,962
You still don't know much
about Ertuğrul, Kayraldi.

83
00:21:05,642 --> 00:21:07,962
Ertuğrul's persistence is his weapon.

84
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,842
Surrender, Ertuğrul!

85
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,682
Surrender.

86
00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:17,562
And ask for my mercy.

87
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:22,602
Surrender, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

88
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:24,122
It's the end of the road.

89
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:26,682
There is no way out.

90
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:32,242
Stay there!

91
00:21:56,242 --> 00:21:57,642
Move back!

92
00:22:02,962 --> 00:22:03,962
Artuk Bey!

93
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:12,962
You shall die!

94
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,562
My Sultan!

95
00:23:03,202 --> 00:23:04,882
I will rip you apart.

96
00:23:05,922 --> 00:23:07,562
I will rip you apart!

97
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:10,482
I'd love to see you try!

98
00:23:18,642 --> 00:23:20,002
Now...

99
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:22,882
Where is your owner to save you?

100
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:26,282
Who will save you from me, now?

101
00:23:30,922 --> 00:23:33,242
Ertuğrul! Surrender!

102
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:44,242
You are in my headquarters,
surrounded by my army!

103
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:47,402
There is no escape!

104
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,162
Stop!

105
00:23:52,962 --> 00:23:53,962
Stop.

106
00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:58,482
Ertuğrul is trapped. Only we can save him.

107
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,002
They won't let my Bey live.

108
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:03,002
They will kill us too if we are spotted.

109
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:09,602
The duty to kill Sadettin will be ours
if anything happens to Ertuğrul.

110
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:13,842
There will be no one to kill that dog
if we are spotted.

111
00:24:41,642 --> 00:24:44,802
It's me or Köpek...

112
00:24:45,762 --> 00:24:49,402
It's justice or cruelty, Günalp Bey<i>.</i>

113
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:52,322
Your point of view...

114
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:55,242
will be the cause of your death.

115
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,922
They ambushed Ertuğrul <i>Bey.</i>

116
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:23,282
That bastard should die

117
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,322
before anything happens to Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

118
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:29,402
Turgut Bey and Sancar Bey are still here.

119
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:32,562
We still have hope.

120
00:25:47,242 --> 00:25:49,442
Finally, I have him in my grasp.

121
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:53,162
Thank God.

122
00:25:54,642 --> 00:25:56,082
You will have his head

123
00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:59,242
before you go on the raid.

124
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:02,922
All right, that's enough.

125
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:04,162
Prepare yourselves.

126
00:26:05,122 --> 00:26:06,362
We'll attack.

127
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:17,882
Go ahead, Günalp Bey<i>.</i>

128
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:21,562
Let's see how much Sadettin,

129
00:26:22,522 --> 00:26:25,402
whom you love as a father
and whom you'd die for,

130
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:28,122
likes you.

131
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:31,282
Go on!

132
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:51,842
-God damn you!
-He has Günalp.

133
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:55,242
There is still hope, Turgut.

134
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:58,922
There will always be hope
as long as Ertuğrul lives.

135
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:00,282
For sure!

136
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:07,322
I will kill you.

137
00:27:19,962 --> 00:27:20,962
Get ready!

138
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:24,122
We will attack.

139
00:27:26,322 --> 00:27:28,722
Are you going to sacrifice Günalp Bey,
blessed Vizier?

140
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:29,962
I'd even sacrifice

141
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,522
my own son for the sake of our state.

142
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:34,722
For sure!

143
00:27:57,162 --> 00:27:59,002
Son. Are you okay?

144
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:01,682
I'm fine, mother. Don't worry.

145
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:10,042
You should patch that up, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

146
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:15,922
As you order, my Sultan.

147
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:24,082
Raiding the tent, huh?

148
00:28:26,242 --> 00:28:28,242
Trying to assassinate the sultan, huh?

149
00:28:28,882 --> 00:28:32,122
Your master is scum
and you are a scumbag!

150
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:34,882
My Sultan...

151
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:38,922
Let me behead this bastard
in front of you.

152
00:28:39,962 --> 00:28:41,362
Not now, Bamsi Alp<i>.</i>

153
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:49,282
Why are you sparing someone
who tried to kill you, my Sultan?

154
00:28:51,002 --> 00:28:53,202
This bastard must die at once.

155
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,482
Mother!

156
00:28:58,322 --> 00:28:59,522
I said not now.

157
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:02,442
Don't make me

158
00:29:02,922 --> 00:29:04,402
repeat myself again.

159
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:26,122
Ertuğrul...

160
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:30,722
Did you really think

161
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:35,202
you could save yourself
if you had Günalp, huh?

162
00:29:38,722 --> 00:29:41,082
Don't you know

163
00:29:41,602 --> 00:29:43,442
I'd even sacrifice Günalp,

164
00:29:43,722 --> 00:29:46,842
whom I love as a son, to get you?

165
00:29:49,242 --> 00:29:51,282
Surrender and ask for my mercy.

166
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:55,922
Or die together with Günalp!

167
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:00,322
This is my last warning.

168
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:03,602
Archers!

169
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:15,922
So, you've seen the true face

170
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:19,002
of a man whom you love as a father.

171
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:26,162
Sooner or later, you'll realize
how wretched he is.

172
00:30:27,282 --> 00:30:28,282
If I die...

173
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:31,002
the duty to kill him is yours.

174
00:30:32,522 --> 00:30:34,402
I promise you that, Günalp Bey<i>.</i>

175
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:40,882
Now...

176
00:30:41,962 --> 00:30:43,642
I will surrender...

177
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:46,002
so that you can live.

178
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:04,762
Get him.

179
00:31:16,402 --> 00:31:19,602
Let me behead him right here
and right now, blessed Vizier!

180
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:24,322
No.

181
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:27,602
He is mine.

182
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,002
But wait...

183
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:49,282
I have to find out his accomplices first.

184
00:31:51,962 --> 00:31:53,722
How did he enter my headquarters?

185
00:31:56,642 --> 00:31:58,162
Who were the two commanders...

186
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,842
who let him in here?

187
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:06,802
Who was behind this scheme?

188
00:32:08,322 --> 00:32:09,802
I will find out.

189
00:32:12,842 --> 00:32:14,962
And your death won't be that easy.

190
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:32,482
I heard that the coward Sultan,

191
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:36,242
whom you respect dearly,

192
00:32:37,242 --> 00:32:39,722
held his mother's hand

193
00:32:40,322 --> 00:32:42,762
and took her to your tribe.

194
00:32:45,162 --> 00:32:49,962
For them,
there is no one else to trust but you.

195
00:32:51,842 --> 00:32:52,842
None but you.

196
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,602
Now tell me.

197
00:33:01,802 --> 00:33:03,402
How did you enter my headquarters?

198
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:20,522
You'll stay silent, huh?

199
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:26,442
Let's see if you are able

200
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:29,482
to be silent after I'm done with you.

201
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:33,602
Kayraldi.

202
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,162
Take him to my tent.

203
00:33:59,362 --> 00:34:00,602
How did he...

204
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:05,522
find the courage to enter my headquarters

205
00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:07,842
with those two commanders?

206
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:16,362
I'll find out.

207
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:21,162
I'll find out.

208
00:34:31,442 --> 00:34:34,682
I'm sure the emperor will also
like these plans, Ares.

209
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:36,642
That's what I thought, Kritos.

210
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,842
The emperor will be pleased, too.

211
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,362
What is it, Marya?

212
00:34:45,442 --> 00:34:47,162
What is it you want to discuss with me?

213
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:50,562
Sir, I've brought important information
about the Kayis.

214
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,082
What is it, Marya?

215
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,162
I heard that

216
00:34:56,242 --> 00:34:57,522
Sultan Giyaseddin left Konya,

217
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:00,242
and is currently residing
with the Kayi Tribe.

218
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:02,122
Are you sure?

219
00:35:03,642 --> 00:35:04,642
Yes, sir.

220
00:35:06,802 --> 00:35:08,042
I told you.

221
00:35:09,642 --> 00:35:12,322
I have sources to gather information
about them.

222
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:15,202
How did you get this information, Marya?

223
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,362
A woman from the Cavdar Tribe.

224
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:23,522
Sadettin Köpek

225
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:26,762
is very powerful within the state.

226
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:32,082
The sultan is aware of this situation.
He must have thought he'd be bested

227
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:35,082
so he took refuge in Ertuğrul's tribe.

228
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:42,202
It's a great opportunity to create chaos
among the Turks, Ares.

229
00:35:42,602 --> 00:35:44,202
We should use it wisely.

230
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:48,802
We will kill the sultan

231
00:35:49,322 --> 00:35:51,922
in the place where he took refuge.

232
00:35:52,562 --> 00:35:55,562
Thus, Ertuğrul's reputation
will be devastated.

233
00:35:57,002 --> 00:36:00,602
You will have this great honor, Ares.

234
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:03,562
Yes, Kritos.

235
00:36:04,922 --> 00:36:07,802
I truly have the Turks
in my claws this time.

236
00:36:08,682 --> 00:36:09,882
Then, lose no time.

237
00:36:10,562 --> 00:36:13,082
Take your men and go to attack him.

238
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:15,642
The sultan will not leave there alive.

239
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:17,962
I knew you'd say that, Kritos.

240
00:36:46,852 --> 00:36:50,572
So you wanted to raid the village
and attempt to kill me in broad day.

241
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:56,652
And you disguised yourself as a soldier
of my state with no shame.

242
00:36:58,092 --> 00:36:59,492
Tell me whose dog you are.

243
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:05,292
My sultan.
He's the helper of Günalp Bey.

244
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:07,052
Günalp Bey?

245
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:12,172
Ertuğrul Bey said
Günalp Bey was loyal to his state.

246
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,692
How could a traitor like him
be his helper?

247
00:37:17,372 --> 00:37:20,012
He doesn't act on his own, my sultan.

248
00:37:24,012 --> 00:37:25,292
Who has your leash?

249
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:27,252
Sadettin Köpek?

250
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:29,612
Whose dog are you?

251
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:31,612
Traitor.

252
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:33,532
You're the real traitor.

253
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:37,852
You and your mother betrayed the state
by killing the sultan.

254
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:39,972
You'll pay for this.

255
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:44,812
How dare you talk to our sultan like this?

256
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:47,812
How dare you talk to our sultan like this?

257
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:51,532
Majesty Emir will toll
the death knell for you all.

258
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,772
You'll all die in pain.

259
00:37:58,212 --> 00:37:59,452
Let him go, Bamsi Alp.

260
00:38:01,132 --> 00:38:03,372
Seems like Sadettin poisoned this jackal.

261
00:38:06,092 --> 00:38:07,092
My sultan.

262
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:08,772
What are you going to do?

263
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:16,252
Bamsi.

264
00:38:31,972 --> 00:38:33,732
To forgive jackals like him would be...

265
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:36,412
a cruelty to justice.

266
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:43,532
First, your pathetic life.

267
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,132
And then Sadettin Köpek's.

268
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:00,932
My sultan.

269
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:38,132
Who let you enter my camp, Ertuğrul?

270
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:42,532
Who were those...

271
00:39:43,612 --> 00:39:44,732
two commanders?

272
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:49,732
No one knows those two commanders,
Majesty Emir.

273
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:54,052
If we find out
who those commanders were...

274
00:39:55,892 --> 00:40:00,812
we'll find out who let Ertuğrul Bey
enter my pavilion.

275
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:07,652
They were brave men loyal to their states,
and who wanted to kill a degenerate

276
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,732
that has the ambition to be the sultan.

277
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:19,052
You should know that
there are many more of them, Sadettin.

278
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:24,812
Sooner or later,

279
00:40:25,612 --> 00:40:29,732
one of them will cut
your sinister head off.

280
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:38,052
I'll cut your head off personally
in front of my commanders, Ertuğrul.

281
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,452
I will parade it all over the land.

282
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,452
I'll display it until it decays.

283
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:59,812
However, first, you'll tell me the names
of those commanders.

284
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:55,812
-They told us to be ready.
-Hurry up.

285
00:42:01,012 --> 00:42:02,252
It's surrounded everywhere.

286
00:42:02,972 --> 00:42:05,292
It's not possible to save Ertuğrul
from that camp.

287
00:42:08,252 --> 00:42:11,532
They'll try to torture my bey
and make him talk.

288
00:42:12,492 --> 00:42:15,132
Ertuğrul won't talk.
Köpek knows that too.

289
00:42:17,172 --> 00:42:19,132
Now, we'll have to think it through.

290
00:42:21,212 --> 00:42:24,532
Our first goal is to find a way
to rescue Ertuğrul.

291
00:42:27,092 --> 00:42:28,172
What will we do?

292
00:42:31,692 --> 00:42:33,692
Togan Bey showed us a tent.

293
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:38,172
We'll sneak in and talk to him.

294
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:41,372
We'll put our heads together and discuss.

295
00:42:42,972 --> 00:42:43,972
Good idea.

296
00:42:45,172 --> 00:42:46,252
Let's go then.

297
00:43:15,332 --> 00:43:18,612
Thank you, Halime Hatun.
May God bless you.

298
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:23,612
-How have you been, Artuk Bey?
-There's nothing

299
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:24,932
to worry about, my sultan.

300
00:43:26,452 --> 00:43:27,572
Thank God, I'm fine.

301
00:43:30,292 --> 00:43:31,932
Can I come in, my sultan?

302
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:35,492
Come in.

303
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,252
My sultan, Ertuğrul Bey rescued
Emir Kamyeri, he's alive and well.

304
00:43:46,052 --> 00:43:48,132
After that, he set off

305
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:51,092
with Hüsamettin Karaca
to raid Sadettin Köpek's camp.

306
00:43:52,612 --> 00:43:53,612
My brave man.

307
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:56,412
Thank God.

308
00:43:56,972 --> 00:43:58,212
Good.

309
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:01,292
I had no doubt
that Ertuğrul Bey would succeed.

310
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:04,212
My sultan, Emir Kamyeri's army is ready.

311
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:06,412
They are on their way to outer Konya.

312
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,252
If something goes wrong,

313
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:11,372
Emir Kamyeri's army will attack
Sadettin Köpek's army.

314
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:15,492
Good.

315
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,252
They should wait for my command.

316
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:21,692
I'll lead the army personally.

317
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:23,692
Your wish is my command.

318
00:44:28,492 --> 00:44:29,492
My sultan.

319
00:44:30,572 --> 00:44:33,732
Emir Sadettin and his jackals found out
that you're here.

320
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:35,292
If you'll allow me,

321
00:44:35,732 --> 00:44:39,252
I'd like to invite the tribe beys
who are loyal to Ertuğrul Bey.

322
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:44,812
Having them here would leverage
our unity and strength.

323
00:44:45,652 --> 00:44:48,972
It's also important for you to be safe,
my sultan.

324
00:44:53,772 --> 00:44:55,172
Good idea, Artuk Bey.

325
00:44:56,132 --> 00:44:58,892
But what if they get afraid
of Emir Sadettin and fail to show up?

326
00:44:59,732 --> 00:45:01,452
Still, we should invite them here,
my sultan.

327
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:09,572
Fine.

328
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:11,572
Send a messenger to the beys, then.

329
00:45:12,052 --> 00:45:14,012
They should be here
if they love their state.

330
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:18,652
Your wish is my command.

331
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:47,292
Tell me.

332
00:45:50,532 --> 00:45:51,532
Tell me.

333
00:45:53,692 --> 00:45:56,412
From whom were
those two commanders getting orders?

334
00:46:06,612 --> 00:46:08,852
Who did they obey...

335
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:14,452
and who brought you into my pavilion?

336
00:46:17,012 --> 00:46:18,652
They were serving justice.

337
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,932
There's only one type of justice
in this pavilion, Ertuğrul.

338
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:35,532
And that's my bloody justice.

339
00:47:03,692 --> 00:47:07,092
You've got time until the steel thickens,
Ertuğrul.

340
00:47:09,812 --> 00:47:11,212
And I've got plenty of time.

341
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,452
Now, I'm asking you again.

342
00:47:18,892 --> 00:47:21,052
Who were the two commanders?

343
00:47:25,652 --> 00:47:29,252
Who did you ally with to get in here?

344
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:35,052
They were brave men,

345
00:47:36,052 --> 00:47:38,092
loyal to Sultan Gıyaseddin
and their state.

346
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:42,932
That's a lie.

347
00:47:47,452 --> 00:47:49,132
If you try to harm our sultan...

348
00:47:49,892 --> 00:47:53,332
who ran away from your cruelty
and took shelter in our village...

349
00:47:54,932 --> 00:47:57,972
you'll be crushed under the throne
that you're dying to sit on.

350
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:03,612
Majesty Emir.

351
00:48:05,972 --> 00:48:07,932
Is His Majesty The Sultan
in the Kayi Village?

352
00:48:12,572 --> 00:48:13,572
Günalp Bey.

353
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,252
I don't doubt a bit
that your helper Aydoğmuş

354
00:48:18,492 --> 00:48:21,532
is on his way to kill our sultan
under this scumbag's order.

355
00:48:23,172 --> 00:48:28,172
However, he'll pay for this with his life.

356
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:33,492
Majesty Emir.

357
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,252
What is he saying?

358
00:48:36,172 --> 00:48:38,972
What would our sultan do
in this dog's village, Günalp Bey?

359
00:48:42,012 --> 00:48:45,452
You still trust his words
that are full of betrayal.

360
00:48:58,172 --> 00:48:59,172
Günalp Bey.

361
00:48:59,732 --> 00:49:01,772
You either trust my words,

362
00:49:02,812 --> 00:49:06,052
or Prince Sadettin's.

363
00:49:08,092 --> 00:49:09,452
What are you saying?

364
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:10,972
Prince?

365
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:12,852
This scumbag Sadettin

366
00:49:13,692 --> 00:49:17,212
has been lying about being the son
of our late sultan, haven't you heard?

367
00:49:21,172 --> 00:49:22,892
In his greed to be the sultan,

368
00:49:23,732 --> 00:49:27,492
he poisoned our late
Sultan Alaeddin Keykubat.

369
00:49:31,292 --> 00:49:37,012
Sultan Gıyaseddin left the palace
to find me because of his treachery.

370
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:47,252
So I sent him to my village
to make sure he was safe.

371
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:48,852
Silence.

372
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:57,612
I'll kill this degenerate right away

373
00:49:58,132 --> 00:50:01,292
and leave with my army
for our state and our sultan.

374
00:50:01,652 --> 00:50:02,652
Kayraldı.

375
00:50:03,892 --> 00:50:06,092
The execution shall be performed
right away.

376
00:50:07,412 --> 00:50:12,052
I'll cut his head off myself
in the middle of my camp.

377
00:50:15,932 --> 00:50:16,932
Take him.

378
00:50:18,372 --> 00:50:19,372
Günalp Bey.

379
00:50:19,852 --> 00:50:21,492
Why would I go through so much trouble

380
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:25,892
when I could kiss this dog's skirt
and solidify my rule over my land?

381
00:50:26,492 --> 00:50:28,892
Open your eyes.
Open them!

382
00:51:14,452 --> 00:51:15,452
Ertuğrul.

383
00:51:17,772 --> 00:51:19,012
It's your time, huh?

384
00:51:27,052 --> 00:51:28,252
Come on, my brave men.

385
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:31,132
It's your turn now.

386
00:51:33,092 --> 00:51:34,092
Günalp.

387
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:37,052
Günalp!

388
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:39,692
Go now.

389
00:51:42,452 --> 00:51:46,972
If God permits, we'll save our state
and our sultan from this traitor.

390
00:52:29,652 --> 00:52:31,532
We survived many hardships.

391
00:52:33,332 --> 00:52:37,092
We struggled
with many enemies and traitors.

392
00:52:38,652 --> 00:52:43,212
However, we've never gone through
something like this.

393
00:52:44,132 --> 00:52:46,532
Our state has never been
in such difficulty

394
00:52:47,892 --> 00:52:49,892
and surrounded by jackals.

395
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:56,812
May God protect our children.

396
00:53:02,092 --> 00:53:04,372
May God protect our state.

397
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:05,932
Amen.

398
00:53:07,132 --> 00:53:08,132
Amen.

399
00:53:21,612 --> 00:53:23,532
God forbid, if something goes wrong,

400
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,972
I have no doubt that my Gıyaseddin

401
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:30,012
will take the lead of his army
and finish that degenerate.

402
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:36,332
However, I hope Ertuğrul Bey succeeds,
so that won't be necessary.

403
00:53:37,012 --> 00:53:38,292
God willing, Mahperi Hatun.

404
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:40,292
God willing.

405
00:53:41,332 --> 00:53:43,852
My Ertuğrul Bey will deal
with Emir Sadettin

406
00:53:44,372 --> 00:53:48,852
just like he did
with his wildest enemies and traitors.

407
00:53:51,492 --> 00:53:55,292
Our state will revive, if God permits.

408
00:53:57,772 --> 00:53:58,772
God willing.

409
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,692
However, Mahperi Hatun,

410
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:09,052
I wish such things never happened.

411
00:54:15,692 --> 00:54:17,212
I know you're angry with me.

412
00:54:18,852 --> 00:54:20,212
And you have the right to be.

413
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:27,332
That traitor Emir Sadettin poisoned me
like he poisoned everyone around him.

414
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:33,252
You have no idea how much
my conscience suffers from what I did.

415
00:54:36,132 --> 00:54:37,972
If we eventually succeed...

416
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:41,412
maybe my son and I will drift apart.

417
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:48,852
I know very well that he won't forgive me.

418
00:54:51,572 --> 00:54:52,812
But that's okay.

419
00:54:53,652 --> 00:54:54,932
As long as our state,

420
00:54:55,372 --> 00:54:58,492
Ertuğrul Bey and my son
are alive and well.

421
00:54:59,612 --> 00:55:01,092
No one else should get hurt.

422
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,092
I'll harden my heart, if necessary.

423
00:55:07,852 --> 00:55:09,132
I'll pray to God...

424
00:55:10,772 --> 00:55:11,932
ask for forgiveness.

425
00:55:19,612 --> 00:55:20,612
Mahperi Hatun.

426
00:55:23,772 --> 00:55:26,332
The important thing is not to be perfect.

427
00:55:28,972 --> 00:55:32,932
The important thing is
learning from your mistakes.

428
00:55:35,452 --> 00:55:39,292
A good scare is worth more
than a good advice.

429
00:55:42,532 --> 00:55:43,532
Maybe...

430
00:55:44,972 --> 00:55:46,652
to see the mistake you made...

431
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:50,812
you had to have a scare.

432
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:58,372
Let's pray
that God lets us reach safety...

433
00:56:00,052 --> 00:56:01,812
before anyone else gets hurt.

434
00:56:03,972 --> 00:56:04,972
God willing.

435
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,172
God willing.

436
00:56:23,772 --> 00:56:25,692
If we can capture Sadettin Köpek,

437
00:56:26,572 --> 00:56:29,012
we may trade him for Ertuğrul Bey.

438
00:56:31,292 --> 00:56:32,332
That's the only way.

439
00:56:32,772 --> 00:56:34,212
We have to find the best time.

440
00:56:37,252 --> 00:56:39,972
We can only do that
before he gets out in the yard.

441
00:56:41,212 --> 00:56:43,092
It's almost impossible
to enter his pavilion.

442
00:56:45,092 --> 00:56:47,932
So we'll finish that business
in the only place we can.

443
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:50,892
Where is that?

444
00:56:52,732 --> 00:56:53,932
In front of his pavilion.

445
00:56:56,092 --> 00:56:57,012
Turgut Bey is right.

446
00:57:01,052 --> 00:57:03,092
-What happened, Togan?
-They took Ertuğrul Bey out

447
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:04,212
to execute him.

448
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:06,092
What are you saying?

449
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:11,372
It's time.

450
00:57:13,252 --> 00:57:15,372
Be very specific about the time you act.

451
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:19,732
If you are late by even one second,
Sadettin Köpek will get away.

452
00:57:22,612 --> 00:57:26,692
Show us the way where we can get
to the pavilion without anyone seeing us.

453
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:29,412
Let's go.

454
00:57:31,972 --> 00:57:32,972
My God.

455
00:57:41,212 --> 00:57:44,212
You handed over the state
to this dog, Günalp Bey.

456
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,092
Many more people...

457
00:57:53,692 --> 00:57:56,172
will die,
like your mother and father.

458
00:57:59,132 --> 00:58:00,132
Stop!

459
00:58:00,772 --> 00:58:01,772
Stop.

460
00:58:19,732 --> 00:58:21,012
Ertuğrul Bey...

461
00:58:22,372 --> 00:58:23,972
belongs to Emir Sadettin.

462
00:58:39,132 --> 00:58:41,692
<i>You were the one to trap our sultan</i>
<i>in the Hanlı Bazaar,</i>

463
00:58:42,412 --> 00:58:44,492
the one to set me and my Alps up,

464
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:47,732
and the one who sent the letter to Ares,
Emir Sadettin.

465
00:58:49,812 --> 00:58:53,492
<i>I relieve you of all your duties,</i>
<i>Sadettin.</i>

466
00:58:54,132 --> 00:58:59,292
<i>You prevented me from serving my state</i>
<i>with your lies.</i>

467
00:58:59,732 --> 00:59:01,012
Your defamation,

468
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:02,612
your crossing of the line,

469
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:06,492
and insulting me in front
of the palace seniors.

470
00:59:06,812 --> 00:59:09,252
Did you think I'd forget that, Ertuğrul?

471
00:59:09,852 --> 00:59:15,612
<i>Just like you disgraced me</i>
<i>in front of the palace seniors,</i>

472
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:20,492
<i>I'll make your death painful and shameful.</i>

473
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:23,732
<i>Even though I couldn't deal with you</i>
<i>as an emir,</i>

474
00:59:24,332 --> 00:59:27,452
<i>I'll defeat you as the sultan, Ertuğrul.</i>

475
00:59:28,692 --> 00:59:29,812
Die, Sadettin.

476
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:32,132
Die so the world can be a better place.

477
00:59:44,772 --> 00:59:45,772
Aslıhan.

478
00:59:50,612 --> 00:59:51,652
Aslıhan.

479
01:00:09,492 --> 01:00:15,812
<i>Sultan Alaeddin gifted me this sword</i>
<i>for saving his life in a battle.</i>

480
01:00:23,212 --> 01:00:24,212
Now...

481
01:00:27,412 --> 01:00:32,732
Now you'll die with the sword
of the sultan that you crushed me for.

482
01:00:40,972 --> 01:00:43,532
Your death won't be so easy.

483
01:00:46,252 --> 01:00:49,652
I won't let you die with the single blow
of a sharp sword.

484
01:01:01,772 --> 01:01:04,532
I'll take over the throne
of the Seljuk Dynasty...

485
01:01:05,652 --> 01:01:07,492
with your head.

486
01:01:13,172 --> 01:01:19,612
A blunt sword like this is suitable
for your ominous head.

487
01:02:32,012 --> 01:02:33,012
Don't get close.

488
01:02:35,492 --> 01:02:36,732
Or I'll cut his throat.

489
01:02:37,052 --> 01:02:38,292
Soldiers, step back!

490
01:03:02,852 --> 01:03:04,332
Now you're in my hands, Köpek.

491
01:03:07,612 --> 01:03:11,732
I would cut your head off right here,
and give it to the coyotes.

492
01:03:12,572 --> 01:03:15,812
But be grateful to my Ertuğrul Bey.

493
01:03:17,612 --> 01:03:20,012
Now you'll release Ertuğrul Bey.

494
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:26,492
-Or else...
-Günalp.

495
01:03:30,332 --> 01:03:31,372
Do what he says.

496
01:03:33,612 --> 01:03:35,692
They don't have anywhere to run.

497
01:03:38,572 --> 01:03:39,572
Günalp Bey.

498
01:03:39,972 --> 01:03:42,012
Bring three horses
to the exit of the camp.

499
01:03:43,092 --> 01:03:45,532
Only two men will bring Ertuğrul Bey.

500
01:03:46,532 --> 01:03:48,252
The soldiers will step back.

501
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:51,932
Otherwise Sadettin dies.

502
01:03:53,492 --> 01:03:54,892
Do what he says, Günalp.

503
01:03:57,252 --> 01:03:58,252
Come on!

504
01:04:22,212 --> 01:04:25,212
Governor Kritos found out about the sultan
being in the Kayi Village.

505
01:04:25,972 --> 01:04:28,252
He found out?
How did he find out?

506
01:04:28,412 --> 01:04:29,412
Marya.

507
01:04:29,572 --> 01:04:31,372
She was a spy for Sadettin Köpek.

508
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:36,172
He got the information from Köpek's men,
and let Governor Kritos know.

509
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:39,532
Brother,
the horses and the dogs got mixed up.

510
01:04:39,812 --> 01:04:41,732
I won't rest until I get rid of the dogs.

511
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:43,132
Bamsi.

512
01:04:43,932 --> 01:04:45,612
Governor Kritos knows

513
01:04:46,172 --> 01:04:49,612
that the sultan is in the Kayi Village
because of Emir Sadettin.

514
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:53,652
He wants me take advantage
of the commotion and raid the village.

515
01:04:54,972 --> 01:04:56,052
I can prevent that.

516
01:04:56,652 --> 01:04:58,012
But I have to find a way.

517
01:05:00,932 --> 01:05:02,092
Brother Ahmet.

518
01:05:02,852 --> 01:05:05,452
Don't you worry.
There's a way.

519
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:10,412
The Oghuz beys loyal to my Ertuğrul Bey
will be by our sultan's side.

520
01:05:10,772 --> 01:05:12,892
Alps will secure the village.

521
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:15,652
Now go and tell that to the Governor.

522
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:20,292
Tell him that it's not possible to raid
the village when the Oghuz beys are there.

523
01:05:20,692 --> 01:05:22,452
I'm glad you said that, Bamsi.

524
01:05:23,092 --> 01:05:26,612
Governor Kritos might give up
on raiding the village

525
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:29,292
when the Oghuz beys are there
with their alps.

526
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:31,652
But we have a bigger problem.

527
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:33,172
What's that, Brother?

528
01:05:33,452 --> 01:05:34,852
The big army from Nicaea.

529
01:05:35,612 --> 01:05:37,412
It's almost ready and about to leave.

530
01:05:38,012 --> 01:05:39,292
I can't stop them.

531
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:41,892
Ahmet, my brother.

532
01:05:42,332 --> 01:05:43,772
Do whatever you can.

533
01:05:44,092 --> 01:05:46,852
We'll start the preparations.

534
01:05:47,212 --> 01:05:49,452
First, my Ertuğrul Bey will get back
alive and well,

535
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:53,492
after that, we'll destroy
the governor and the army.

536
01:05:53,852 --> 01:05:55,012
God willing, Bamsi.

537
01:05:55,772 --> 01:05:59,452
I'll go back to Bilecik right away
and let Governor Kritos know.

538
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:02,452
Thank you, Brother.

539
01:06:03,052 --> 01:06:04,052
Thank you.

540
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:06,252
Come on.

541
01:07:03,612 --> 01:07:04,612
Go.

542
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:23,172
Untie Ertuğrul Bey's hands.

543
01:07:26,812 --> 01:07:28,212
Do what he says, Günalp.

544
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:47,532
Now, let Ertuğrul Bey go.

545
01:07:53,052 --> 01:07:54,772
When you let Ertuğrul Bey go,

546
01:07:55,332 --> 01:07:56,972
we'll let Sadettin go.

547
01:08:01,812 --> 01:08:03,332
Do as he says, Kayraldı.

548
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:05,812
Go, Ertuğrul.

549
01:08:06,092 --> 01:08:07,852
Let's see how far you can go.

550
01:08:11,092 --> 01:08:13,132
Your death is upon you, you should know.

551
01:08:34,212 --> 01:08:36,172
I'll come after you, Ertuğrul.

552
01:08:38,052 --> 01:08:39,052
I'll kill you...

553
01:08:40,332 --> 01:08:41,332
your tribe...

554
01:08:42,772 --> 01:08:44,972
and your family.

555
01:08:47,692 --> 01:08:50,492
I'll slaughter Gündoğdu Bey's tribe
as well.

556
01:08:52,372 --> 01:08:53,572
Just wait, Sadettin.

557
01:08:56,252 --> 01:08:58,652
You'll get your share of justice's sword.

558
01:09:02,092 --> 01:09:06,092
I'll make everyone pay
for what you did.

559
01:09:11,252 --> 01:09:13,092
My rage won't cool down until...

560
01:09:14,332 --> 01:09:15,572
I kill all of the Kayis.

561
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:20,052
Your rage will be buried with you.

562
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:24,292
I'll cut off your head

563
01:09:25,252 --> 01:09:26,572
before you can hurt anyone.

564
01:10:07,332 --> 01:10:08,332
Giddy up!

565
01:10:19,092 --> 01:10:20,492
We'll go after them.

566
01:10:20,972 --> 01:10:22,532
Don't worry, Majesty Emir.

567
01:10:23,492 --> 01:10:24,892
They won't get far.

568
01:10:27,372 --> 01:10:28,732
I removed their horseshoes.

569
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:34,452
That's a great idea, Kayraldı.

570
01:10:36,852 --> 01:10:37,972
We're leaving now.

571
01:10:44,372 --> 01:10:45,812
Do you hear me, Günalp?

572
01:10:47,852 --> 01:10:49,532
We'll find them, Majesty Emir.

573
01:11:09,052 --> 01:11:10,932
I know where they are going, Karaca.

574
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,580
Something's wrong with the horses.

575
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,260
They removed my horseshoes.

576
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,140
Mine too.

577
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,020
They must be after us.

578
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:36,140
We have to get to the cave
where we're meeting Togan Bey.

579
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,820
Whatever they do,

580
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,340
we won't go back
before we have Sadettin's head.

581
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:49,460
First, let's get to the cave
and treat your wounds.

582
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:51,820
Gather your strength.

583
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:56,740
Come on.

584
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:04,940
You're a disgrace!

585
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,260
You have no skill!

586
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:13,860
Two alps...

587
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,380
come up to my pavilion,

588
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:20,660
and no one knows about it.

589
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:27,340
They took me hostage
in front of my pavilion.

590
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:30,100
In front of my soldiers.

591
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,820
We can't even catch a traitor.

592
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,660
And we're supposed to
take over Samsat Castle?

593
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:41,220
Is this how we'll do it?

594
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:50,260
As for you...

595
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:58,660
I put you in charge of a big camp.

596
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,780
You said it was secured everywhere.

597
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:06,500
Where did those two alps come from?

598
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,180
Forgive me, Majesty Emir.

599
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,460
-Believe--
-I can't forgive.

600
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:14,380
"Forgive me."

601
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:17,060
If you can't do your duty,

602
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,060
why should you even live?

603
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:36,700
Kayraldı.

604
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:41,300
Throw his body to the ravens.

605
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:05,620
Hüsamettin.

606
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:07,780
What's the situation?

607
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:13,620
The soldiers are deployed on high hills.

608
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,860
They can't get away.

609
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:18,940
Majesty Emir.

610
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,820
The only place they can run to
is the creek bed.

611
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,420
Fine, the creek bed it is.

612
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,500
I'll personally go that direction
with my soldiers.

613
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,700
Majesty Emir.

614
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,620
I'd like to go look for them now.

615
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,980
I've done night searches many times.

616
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:49,740
Fine.

617
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,260
Take big units with you.

618
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:55,700
Everyone should search
the area they are responsible for.

619
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:57,740
Nothing will pass.

620
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,380
You've seen what happens to those
who fail their duties.

621
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,060
Come on.

622
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,260
Everybody, get back to work.

623
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,150
May I enter, my Sultan?

624
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:40,550
Come in, Ibn Al Arabi.

625
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:49,990
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

626
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:52,710
Sit down, please.

627
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:06,310
I heard what happened, my Sultan.

628
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,270
I'm sorry.

629
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:13,150
Thank God you were able
to overcome these dark forces.

630
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:16,510
God protected you.

631
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:19,190
God bless you, Ibn Al Arabi.

632
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:22,110
The enemy pursues us relentlessly.

633
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:25,830
But thanks to God
and the bravery of the alps,

634
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:27,790
we were able to overcome them.

635
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:35,390
This war is clearly destined
to continue until one of us is dead.

636
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:41,430
This is a struggle between
good and evil, my Sultan.

637
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:44,070
This struggle

638
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:48,350
began when the world began,
and will go on until the apocalypse.

639
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:51,190
Everything has its opposite.

640
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:53,950
Good cannot exist without evil.

641
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:58,710
Sweetness cannot exist without bitterness.

642
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:04,950
Our duty is to sustain that which is good,
and prevent that which is evil.

643
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:07,470
He whose intention is good...

644
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:11,630
is strengthened when exposed to evil.

645
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:17,990
He can destroy its cruelty and treachery
with the power of an erupting volcano.

646
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:23,670
Don't be afraid of their numbers
and power, my Sultan.

647
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:29,870
Abraha led an army
of elephants against the Ka'ba.

648
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:34,190
But God destroyed them
with the Ababil birds.

649
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,190
If we stand with God,

650
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:40,190
God will stand with us.

651
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:45,830
Holy God says this in the Qur'an,

652
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:50,470
"So, do not weaken, and do not grieve,

653
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:55,870
and you will be superior,
if you are true believers."

654
01:19:57,550 --> 01:20:01,790
There is something which worries me,
which I'd like to talk to you about.

655
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:03,870
Of course, my Sultan.

656
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:09,830
My own mother was involved...
in these calamities.

657
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:14,350
She shows regret now.

658
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:17,910
But... I don't know how I should react.

659
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:23,630
You are not one of the people,
you are responsible for the people.

660
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:26,270
You are the sultan.

661
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:31,590
The people will obey whatever you command.

662
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:36,030
You can't ever go to extremes.

663
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:41,070
In matters of justice,
of mercy, of affection,

664
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:43,190
you must show restraint

665
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:47,790
and stay on the path of righteousness.

666
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:55,230
For you set an example to the people
with the decisions you make.

667
01:20:57,230 --> 01:20:59,630
Holy God says in the Qur'an,

668
01:21:00,790 --> 01:21:03,390
"If you show good or conceal it,

669
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:06,790
or pardon an offense,

670
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:10,630
know that God is ever Pardoning.

671
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:14,070
He is ever Competent."

672
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:21,470
Punishment serves to
better the wrong-doer.

673
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:25,390
If she regrets what she's done...

674
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:31,310
and if you're convinced
she won't repeat it...

675
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:37,750
you must decide justly,
taking all that into consideration.

676
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:42,830
In times of trouble your guidance
has helped me to act justly.

677
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:47,070
Now, in these troubled times,

678
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:49,350
your words are a source
of great comfort to me

679
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:52,270
and will, I hope,
help me establish true justice.

680
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:54,510
God willing.

681
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:58,230
God willing.

682
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:23,550
-Ertuğrul Bey.
-Come, Togan Bey.

683
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:38,070
I thank God you're all right,
Ertuğrul Bey.

684
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:39,950
Thank you.

685
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:42,510
Any news?

686
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:46,190
Sadettin's soldiers are everywhere.
He's somewhere among them.

687
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:49,550
He's leading the search himself.

688
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:52,870
And Günalp Bey?

689
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:56,190
He's involved in the search too,
in another direction.

690
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:00,990
He's operating separately
from Sadettin's army.

691
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:06,710
While he's looking for us...

692
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:09,830
we'll catch him off guard.

693
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:15,790
Together with Hüsamettin Karaca
we'll gather our loyal soldiers

694
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:17,430
and catch up with you.

695
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:20,030
Thank you, Togan Bey.

696
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:23,830
What now, my Bey?

697
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:38,350
We're going to lure Köpek, Turgut.

698
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:42,350
We're going to get him where we want him.

699
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:47,270
Then the hunt can begin.

700
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,390
God help you, Ertuğrul Bey.

701
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:55,350
-God help us all, Togan Bey.
-Amen.

702
01:24:57,230 --> 01:25:00,270
Sadettin Köpek is prey
that will come to us.

703
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:03,070
We'll surround him like a pack of wolves.

704
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:08,430
When he's trapped, we'll strike,

705
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:13,230
then finish him with our claws and swords.

706
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:22,430
The time for talking is over.

707
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:28,110
We'll speak our last words to Köpek

708
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:30,430
with our swords and claws.

709
01:25:45,110 --> 01:25:48,750
Governor Kritos learned that you
and Mahperi Hatun were here

710
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:51,710
through Sadettin, my Sultan.

711
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:53,950
How?

712
01:25:54,950 --> 01:26:00,830
Köpek has a female spy
near to Governor Kritos, Marya.

713
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:06,430
Köpek's guard told Marya that you
were here. And Marya told the Governor.

714
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:08,070
Köpek.

715
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:12,630
That bastard is prepared to work
with the governor if it helps him.

716
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:16,710
This state has never
known a traitor like him.

717
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:20,550
Even the infidels know we're here.

718
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:24,070
-We must act.
-May I enter, my Sultan?

719
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:25,750
Come in, Artuk Bey.

720
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:38,990
My Sultan, if you'll permit it,
the Oğuz beys wish to see you.

721
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:41,550
Show them in, Artuk Bey. Show them in.

722
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:44,910
Come in, beys.

723
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:35,470
Welcome, my beys.

724
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:37,550
-Thank you, my Sultan.
-Thank you, my Sultan.

725
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:42,110
It pleases me greatly to see you here.

726
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:46,110
My Sultan, we came as soon
as we heard you were here.

727
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:50,350
The traitors' attempt on your life
has angered us all.

728
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:53,270
Our alps will protect the Kayi tribe.

729
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:57,310
Not even the emperor,
let alone the governor,

730
01:27:57,870 --> 01:27:59,070
will be able to harm you.

731
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:07,190
Once again you have proven your worth.

732
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:10,670
As long as there are
loyal men such as yourselves

733
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:13,190
our state will always prevail.

734
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:15,510
-Thank you, my Sultan.
-Thank you, my Sultan.

735
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:19,710
Sit down, my beys.
There's no need to stand.

736
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:34,270
You'll be rewarded for bringing me
such important news, Marya.

737
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:41,710
Governor Kritos.

738
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:44,870
I went to the Kayi tribe.

739
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:47,750
But we can't possibly attack them now.

740
01:28:48,230 --> 01:28:50,910
-Why not?
-The beys of the tribes

741
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:54,830
have joined together there
to protect the sultan.

742
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:58,230
Attacking the tribe now
would be an act of madness.

743
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:02,750
What then?
Do we just abandon this opportunity?

744
01:29:03,430 --> 01:29:06,070
Kritos, whatever we do,
we must do it right.

745
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:08,910
If we don't, we'll pay a heavy price.

746
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:11,030
There must be a way, Ares!

747
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:16,030
-We can't just give up.
-We'll never give up, Kritos.

748
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,950
But if we make a move
before the army gets here

749
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:22,550
they'll massacre
every single one of our men.

750
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:24,070
You're right.

751
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:27,070
We must wait for the army.

752
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:31,150
Trust me on this, Kritos. Don't worry.

753
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:34,510
Even if the sultan
manages to leave the tribe alive,

754
01:29:35,230 --> 01:29:37,950
I'll finish him off on the road to Konya.

755
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:42,390
This is of crucial importance to us, Ares.

756
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:49,510
I have work to do now.
We'll discuss this later.

757
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:51,430
As you wish, Kritos.

758
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:55,430
Door.

759
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:06,350
You weren't this afraid
of the Turks before, Ares.

760
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,390
What changed?

761
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:17,870
Are your days of being
a great warrior behind--

762
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:22,830
What do you know of war, Marya?

763
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:25,470
Don't provoke me.

764
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:30,230
Unless you want to join your brother,
don't push me.

765
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:31,910
Understand?

766
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:50,390
I'll find out what you're up to, Ares.

767
01:30:58,270 --> 01:31:00,270
I'll have my revenge
for my brother's death.

768
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:04,150
You'll curse the day you were born.

769
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:12,190
Begin, my beys.

770
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:17,550
-<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>
-<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

771
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:29,070
My beys, I intend to stay away
from the palace for a while.

772
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:34,550
My absence from the palace will end
when the traitors have been purged.

773
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:36,230
-God willing.
-God willing.

774
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:40,150
Be assured I'm doing everything
in my power to save our state.

775
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:43,390
If I am to die,

776
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:46,750
I will die fighting alongside
my beys and alps.

777
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:50,830
My Sultan, has there been
any news from Ertuğrul Bey?

778
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:56,030
Ertuğrul Bey is hunting down
our enemy, Sadettin Köpek.

779
01:31:57,190 --> 01:31:59,350
And if he can't kill
Sadettin Köpek, my Sultan?

780
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:03,790
Then I will take command
of Emir Kamyeri's army myself.

781
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:08,550
Defeating Sadettin Köpek
is a cause I am prepared to die for.

782
01:32:11,910 --> 01:32:15,470
I wanted to see for myself
that my beys were with me.

783
01:32:16,710 --> 01:32:18,710
We're with you, my Sultan.

784
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,190
And not just here.

785
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:24,750
Wherever you go,
we'll be with you with our alps.

786
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:34,710
We live to serve God,
our state and our country.

787
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:39,950
If we need to unite today, we will unite.

788
01:32:41,550 --> 01:32:44,110
If we must die, we'll die together.

789
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:56,470
I, Giyaseddin Keyhüsrev,
son of Sultan Alaeddin,

790
01:32:57,510 --> 01:33:01,350
swear that I'll fight
to the death for my state.

791
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:04,830
We swear loyalty
to our state and our sultan.

792
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:24,190
They're gone.

793
01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:30,070
They ran away?

794
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:32,670
They escaped.

795
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:39,110
They still intend to kill Emir Sadettin.

796
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:40,790
How could they, my Bey?

797
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:43,990
They left their horses here
to create a diversion.

798
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:46,510
They're still after Emir Sadettin.

799
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:48,670
This is madness.

800
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:52,990
What can three men do
among all those soldiers, my Bey?

801
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:58,390
Ertuğrul led us here deliberately,

802
01:33:59,030 --> 01:34:02,030
to reduce the number of soldiers
Emir Sadettin has around him.

803
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:06,110
But how could they know
where His Eminence is, my Bey?

804
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:08,390
Ertuğrul is not alone.

805
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:13,710
His allies will have told him.

806
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:20,110
If that's the case, they'll have
no trouble locating Emir Sadettin.

807
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:22,110
We must go now.

808
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:27,150
I'm going to make my way up
the river. Catch up with me there.

809
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:29,150
As you command, my Bey.

810
01:34:30,910 --> 01:34:33,990
<i>You either listen to me or...</i>

811
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:36,270
to Prince Sadettin.

812
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:38,350
What are you talking about, Ertuğrul Bey?
What prince?

813
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:40,070
The dog Sadettin

814
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:44,150
likes to spread the lie that he's the late
Sultan's son, or didn't you know that?

815
01:34:45,190 --> 01:34:46,190
Commander?

816
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:49,030
Have you ever heard it said

817
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:52,070
that Emir Sadettin's father was

818
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:55,030
Sultan Alaeddin,
father of Sultan Keyhüsrev?

819
01:34:58,390 --> 01:34:59,390
Tell me, commander.

820
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:02,950
I have, my Bey.

821
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:09,030
From whom?

822
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:13,190
From... Emir Sadettin himself.

823
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:17,790
Come on, Emir Sadettin.

824
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:27,470
My Bey.

825
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:31,550
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine, brother.

826
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:35,390
I'm fine.

827
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:39,030
God willing

828
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:42,830
we won't rest until Köpek is dead.

829
01:36:43,070 --> 01:36:44,070
Agreed.

830
01:36:46,630 --> 01:36:47,630
Agreed.

831
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:51,550
My Sultan.

832
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:55,590
-Are you training, Gündüz Alp?
-I am, my Sultan.

833
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:57,750
I didn't know you were there.

834
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:00,630
Come and sit down, Gündüz Alp.

835
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:12,070
You are a fine swordsman.

836
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,670
Thank you, my Sultan.

837
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:16,270
My father left me to guard the tribe.

838
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:19,270
It's my duty to protect it
while he's away.

839
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:23,550
-That's why I train all the time.
-Well said.

840
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:29,430
To protect the legacy of our fathers,
and keep their memory alive,

841
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:31,550
is a son's most important duty.

842
01:38:31,790 --> 01:38:34,230
My father taught me how to use a sword.

843
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:37,630
Did Sultan Alaeddin teach you too?

844
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,230
Yes. He did.

845
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:45,710
When I was a child
he would take us on hunts.

846
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:49,870
Sahbaz would teach me
to ride and shoot arrows.

847
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:54,430
"The son will replace his father.

848
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:57,750
One of his two eyes.

849
01:38:58,910 --> 01:39:01,990
A son is everything to the ruler.

850
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:06,270
A father leaves something to the son,

851
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:10,110
but what good comes of that
if there is no state?"

852
01:39:10,990 --> 01:39:12,510
That's what my father always said.

853
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:16,790
You are protecting his legacy, my Sultan.

854
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:20,510
You defeated all the traitors.

855
01:39:20,990 --> 01:39:22,430
Thank you, Gündüz Alp.

856
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:26,590
My father has gone
to fight the traitors, too.

857
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:30,270
It's been a long time since he left.

858
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:32,590
I miss him.

859
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:37,030
But I know his duty is more important.

860
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:40,310
So, I try to stay strong.

861
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:42,470
Good for you, Gündüz Alp.

862
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:47,430
As long as brave men
father such brave sons,

863
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:50,270
I know the state shall prevail.

864
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:54,110
It will, my Sultan.

865
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:28,590
Take a good look round.

866
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:55,830
Stop!

867
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:08,950
Your Eminence.
They've withdrawn into the forest.

868
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:14,590
I'm going to find and kill them
even if they're in hell.

869
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:17,190
Commander, cover our backs.

870
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:18,910
As you command, Your Eminence.

871
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:20,870
You're responsible for covering our front.

872
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:24,790
Search everywhere.
Leave no stone unturned.

873
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:29,150
Ertuğrul is not to leave
this forest alive. Got it?

874
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:31,470
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

875
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:53,670
Right. Time to show ourselves.

876
01:43:17,870 --> 01:43:19,190
Ertuğrul!

877
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:23,430
Come on, brothers.
For our state, for our country,

878
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:26,910
for our late Sultan Alaeddin.

879
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:30,390
For Aslihan Hatun.

880
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:34,950
For every one of our fallen brothers.

881
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:36,870
Attack!

882
01:43:37,190 --> 01:43:38,942
For God!

883
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:40,870
-For God!
-For God!

884
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:41,990
Kayraldi!

885
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:54,710
We're here, Ertuğrul Bey.

886
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:59,070
Traitors!

887
01:45:06,190 --> 01:45:07,190
Ertuğrul!

888
01:45:08,230 --> 01:45:09,230
Köpek's running away!

889
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:16,390
My Bey, Aslihan Hatun's dagger!

890
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:20,470
Kill Köpek with it.

891
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:44,630
My goodness, Mother!

892
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:48,750
What a nice cap. Did you make it?

893
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:50,950
Yes.

894
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:54,830
For Bamsi and Hafsa's baby.

895
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:59,350
My dear Hafsa.
I wonder what she's doing now?

896
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:02,830
Do you think she's all right?

897
01:47:04,190 --> 01:47:05,590
Do you think she's better?

898
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:08,990
I'm sure she is, dear. I'm sure she is.

899
01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:15,630
There isn't anything we can do
except pray for her.

900
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:23,550
God willing, she'll return
to our tribe soon with her baby.

901
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:26,470
God willing, Mother.

902
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:33,310
Aslihan's death, Hafsa leaving...

903
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:36,910
It all came at once.

904
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:42,110
And Ertuğrul.

905
01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:49,790
It's been a long time, Mother.

906
01:47:51,670 --> 01:47:54,510
I know, his is a difficult task.

907
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:59,070
But bearing the longing
in my heart is difficult too.

908
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:03,950
My dear daughter.

909
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:07,950
A long time ago...

910
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:11,590
my husband, Suleyman Shah...

911
01:48:12,670 --> 01:48:16,790
would leave on perilous missions
and I'd feel just the same as you.

912
01:48:19,190 --> 01:48:23,110
And now I wait like that once more...

913
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:25,310
whenever Ertuğrul is gone.

914
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:29,950
What keeps us going...

915
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:35,110
is the just cause of those who are gone.

916
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:36,910
True, Mother.

917
01:48:39,230 --> 01:48:45,230
I hope that Ertuğrul destroys
the tyrants with his own sword

918
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:48,830
and disperses the dark clouds above us.

919
01:48:52,030 --> 01:48:54,750
The sun will rise over our country again.

920
01:48:56,350 --> 01:49:02,550
I hope Ertuğrul brings light
to our tribe and tent again soon, Mother.

921
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:06,430
I hope so too, dear. I hope so too.

922
01:49:08,310 --> 01:49:11,430
May Ertuğrul return victorious to us.

923
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:16,630
I hope the sun comes with your baby.

924
01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:18,870
I hope so too, Mother.

925
01:49:20,110 --> 01:49:21,110
I hope so.

926
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:27,550
May God protect Ertuğrul for our state,
our country and our children.

927
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:30,670
Amen, dear. Amen.

928
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:48,310
Ertuğrul...

929
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:51,470
Look at yourself.

930
01:50:56,230 --> 01:51:00,150
My path I walk will be soaked
with your blood.

931
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:13,790
Stubborn. Always so stubborn.

932
01:51:15,190 --> 01:51:17,150
Your stubbornness brought you to this.

933
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:25,790
Was it worth it?

934
01:51:28,510 --> 01:51:29,590
Was it? Tell me.

935
01:51:31,910 --> 01:51:37,830
If you'd obeyed me we could
have united to save the state.

936
01:51:39,190 --> 01:51:43,830
The state will be saved...
when you die, Sadettin.

937
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:51,710
I've only ever loved two things.

938
01:51:54,230 --> 01:51:55,230
My state...

939
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:57,750
and Aslihan.

940
01:52:01,190 --> 01:52:02,950
You made Aslihan my enemy.

941
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:06,510
You took her from me.

942
01:52:08,190 --> 01:52:10,310
You made me spill my beloved's blood.

943
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:17,870
But it's over.

944
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:22,390
I've dedicated my life
to ascending the Seljuk throne,

945
01:52:23,110 --> 01:52:25,510
I won't let you take it from me.

946
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:39,710
I'm going to kill you with
the dagger of the woman you murdered.

947
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:24,710
Günalp.

948
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:28,190
My son, Günalp!

949
01:53:39,837 --> 01:53:40,750
Kill him!

950
01:53:44,070 --> 01:53:45,550
Kill him, finish this!

951
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:47,950
Emir Sadettin...

952
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:54,350
Did you kill Sultan Alaeddin?

953
01:54:00,030 --> 01:54:01,230
Tell me, now!

954
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:05,350
Do you lie that you are a prince
so that you can be sultan?

955
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,390
Can you hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

956
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:11,110
Don't lie to me!

957
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:16,590
You declared yourself to be a prince.

958
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:23,350
So I did!

959
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:30,910
You... are obliged to obey my command!

960
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:37,710
Yes, I killed the sultan!

961
01:54:42,630 --> 01:54:45,230
Because that throne is my right.

962
01:54:45,830 --> 01:54:47,990
My right!

963
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:54,510
Now, you will obey me
and kill Ertuğrul. Do it!

964
01:54:56,110 --> 01:54:58,390
You are a liar!

965
01:54:59,950 --> 01:55:02,350
Everything you've said
up to now has been a lie!

966
01:55:03,310 --> 01:55:07,430
I won't allow you to poison
anyone else with your lies.

967
01:55:10,270 --> 01:55:11,270
Ertuğrul Bey.

968
01:55:14,110 --> 01:55:17,670
This dog deserves to feel your sword.

969
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:36,270
Bastard!

970
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:44,830
Your father didn't obey me either.

971
01:55:50,270 --> 01:55:53,110
Your father rebelled against me.

972
01:55:56,350 --> 01:56:00,110
Your parents got what they deserved.

973
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:07,510
I raised you...

974
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:12,790
And you disobeyed me.

975
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:19,390
Just like them... you have to die.

976
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:51,860
The path of migration...

977
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:56,460
is so perilous.

978
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,020
Shelter...

979
01:58:04,740 --> 01:58:06,500
so far away.

980
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:14,700
There is no road that doesn't end.

981
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:21,540
Do not feel remorse, Sultan Sadettin.

982
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:28,260
Aslıhan...

983
01:58:33,020 --> 01:58:34,380
Aslıhan...

984
01:58:44,220 --> 01:58:46,060
No more dark words, Köpek.

985
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:58,340
It's time dark blood ran down dark steel.

986
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:04,780
Time the dark soil is drenched in blood.

987
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:09,580
Time the dark clouds dispersed...

988
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:14,020
before the brightness of the new day.

989
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:15,100
As with our other gallants...

990
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:21,620
your death was not in vain, Aslıhan.

991
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:38,820
My loyal castle commander, Günalp Bey.

992
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:42,940
Leave us now and resume your duties.

993
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:46,900
I entrust Karacahisar to you.

994
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:17,060
Aslıhan was avenged, my bey.

995
02:01:18,260 --> 02:01:19,260
She was, Turgut.

996
02:01:28,500 --> 02:01:29,740
Thank you, my bey.

997
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:33,460
Ertuğrul.

998
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:41,180
Brother.

999
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:47,580
By command of our sultan...

1000
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:51,580
the head of the traitor has been severed,
Husamettin Karaca.

1001
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:54,900
We have done our duty.

1002
02:01:58,460 --> 02:02:00,420
I will take command of the army.

1003
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:03,700
-Rest easy now.
-Thank you.

1004
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:08,220
May God bless you.

1005
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:11,500
May God bless you too, Ertuğrul Bey.

1006
02:02:12,620 --> 02:02:15,660
We will display that dog Sadettin's
head for the people to see...

1007
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:19,100
just as he planned to do to you.

1008
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:26,780
May the traitors among us,
and the enemies which covet our land,

1009
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:29,700
know of Köpek's end.

1010
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:36,820
May they know it so
that they can have no doubt...

1011
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:41,020
that our state will be eternal.

1012
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:54,260
May they come to know with certainty
that no one can destroy the Turkish state.

1013
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:04,860
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

1014
02:03:05,460 --> 02:03:06,940
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

1015
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:09,220
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

1016
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:11,420
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

1017
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:13,500
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

1018
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:15,580
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

1019
02:03:34,740 --> 02:03:37,420
Köpek will be on the road to Samsat soon.

1020
02:03:38,740 --> 02:03:39,780
My sultan,

1021
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:44,020
Ertuğrul Bey will have dealt with that
bastard before he has a chance to move.

1022
02:03:44,540 --> 02:03:46,740
I'm sure we'll hear
from Ertuğrul Bey soon.

1023
02:03:51,940 --> 02:03:54,780
I hope they signal good news.
At this time of night...

1024
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:02,900
It is unusual for someone
to approach the tribe so late.

1025
02:04:05,740 --> 02:04:09,300
My sultan, if you will allow it,
let us go check who it is.

1026
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:14,620
-May I enter, my sultan?
-Come in.

1027
02:04:16,940 --> 02:04:18,100
My sultan.

1028
02:04:20,620 --> 02:04:24,300
My sultan, good news,
Ertuğrul Bey has returned.

1029
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:27,780
Ertuğrul Bey?

1030
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:32,540
Thank you, God.

1031
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:46,380
My sultan.

1032
02:04:56,900 --> 02:04:58,220
Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.

1033
02:04:58,700 --> 02:05:01,420
-I'm glad to be back, my sultan.
-I hope you bring good news.

1034
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:14,140
With God's permission, the duty you
gave us has been fulfilled, my sultan.

1035
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:18,180
The menace that was Sadettin Köpek
has been dealt with.

1036
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:28,300
The road we embarked upon
to secure the future of our state...

1037
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:32,140
led either to martyrdom or victory.

1038
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:39,140
Thank God, with his help...
it led to our victory.

1039
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:42,300
The traitors among us,

1040
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:45,260
and the enemies who supported them,

1041
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:47,100
have been disappointed, my sultan.

1042
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:51,420
Justice prevailed
and the evil-doers punished.

1043
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:56,780
You have avenged our late sultan,
Alaeddin Kayqubad...

1044
02:05:58,420 --> 02:06:00,420
Turgut Bey's wife, Aslıhan Hatun...

1045
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:06,780
and all those suffering
oppression, Ertuğrul Bey.

1046
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:11,060
The sun of the state
rises once more over our land.

1047
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:16,100
Stories of your heroism
will be told and retold for centuries.

1048
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:25,140
"No matter how big the snake's head...

1049
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:29,060
our swords will suffice
to sever its head."

1050
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:30,860
That's what you said, Ertuğrul Bey.

1051
02:06:33,220 --> 02:06:37,500
May God gaze upon your heart,
your wrist and your sword.

1052
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:43,620
I came to understand that a state grows
not only with the might of its reign...

1053
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:46,900
but with the loyalty and skill...

1054
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:49,860
of the brave men who
offer their lives in its service.

1055
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:58,540
May God not deprive our state
of brave men like yourselves.

1056
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:02,460
Thank you, Mahperi Hatun.

1057
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:07,220
This is my command...

1058
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:11,420
Ertuğrul Bey, the title
of frontier bey is once again yours.

1059
02:07:20,620 --> 02:07:23,860
These lands shall be under
your command and rule.

1060
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:28,660
May the Seljuk banner be raised
once more at the tribe and the castle.

1061
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:37,060
I shall ride back to Konya
and resume my duties.

1062
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:43,100
My mother will no longer
involve herself with matters of state

1063
02:07:43,220 --> 02:07:44,860
and will remain at the Alaiye Palace.

1064
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:48,740
As you wish, my sultan.

1065
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:53,300
I am content as long as you
and our state prosper.

1066
02:07:55,820 --> 02:07:57,380
With your permission, my sultan...

1067
02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:03,780
Mother.

1068
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:07,100
My son.

1069
02:08:08,420 --> 02:08:09,580
As you said...

1070
02:08:10,180 --> 02:08:14,180
I proved myself worthy of both my
ancestors' blood and your milk, Mother.

1071
02:08:15,380 --> 02:08:16,740
My brave son.

1072
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:29,980
May God keep you with us always, my son.

1073
02:08:30,140 --> 02:08:32,940
-Amen.
-May God keep you with us always, Mother.

1074
02:08:37,700 --> 02:08:38,940
My Ertuğrul Bey.

1075
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:42,740
My brave son.

1076
02:08:43,820 --> 02:08:47,540
You rid our state and our lands
of a great evil, Ertuğrul Bey.

1077
02:08:48,980 --> 02:08:50,740
May God bless you.

1078
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:53,660
May God bless us all, Halime Hatun.

1079
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:05,980
My brave boy.

1080
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:26,580
May your victory be blessed, my bey.

1081
02:09:27,620 --> 02:09:30,860
I hope God bestows
many victories upon you.

1082
02:09:31,300 --> 02:09:33,300
-Amen.
-Amen.

1083
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:35,020
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

1084
02:09:37,340 --> 02:09:39,340
I will leave tomorrow, God willing.

1085
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:42,140
Is there anything you wish of me
before I go, Ertuğrul Bey?

1086
02:09:43,380 --> 02:09:46,980
My sultan, my only wish is
that you fare well...

1087
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:51,100
and that your reign
furthers the power of our state.

1088
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:57,420
And we will begin the preparations
that will see Sogut become our home.

1089
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:01,900
A new era has begun for us all.

1090
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:08,740
My sultan...

1091
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:14,500
we founded this state with our
pure faith, our honorable blood,

1092
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:16,980
and our unwavering courage.

1093
02:10:20,940 --> 02:10:22,660
As long as these continue undiminished

1094
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:29,020
nobody's power will be such that
they can harm the state of the Turks.

1095
02:10:33,634 --> 02:11:04,434
