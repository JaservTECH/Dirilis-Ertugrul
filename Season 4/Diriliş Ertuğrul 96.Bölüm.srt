00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 96 will start after 12:28 min.

12:39.029 --> 12:42.949
<i>I swear to God, his holy book, his flag</i>

12:43.549 --> 12:45.389
<i>and to my steel sword.</i>

12:45.989 --> 12:48.629
<i>May the blue skies and the brown earth</i>
<i>be my witness.</i>

12:49.389 --> 12:51.349
<i>I swear on everything</i>

12:51.829 --> 12:55.109
<i>that I will not stop</i>
<i>until I make those who set traps</i>

12:55.589 --> 12:58.509
<i>and betrayed us pay for what they did.</i>

12:58.829 --> 13:02.269
<i>In this pursuit of justice and order,</i>

13:02.789 --> 13:06.029
<i>I will be the nightmare of the oppressors</i>
<i>and the thugs.</i>

13:06.429 --> 13:10.309
<i>I'll keep being the fear of the oppressors</i>
<i>and hope of the oppressed.</i>

13:27.269 --> 13:28.469
Goktug...

13:32.029 --> 13:33.709
Where is this Ares?

13:34.189 --> 13:36.389
He was so willing to sell the bazaar,

13:36.549 --> 13:39.749
it's not a good sign that he is late,
blessed vizier.

13:49.989 --> 13:51.349
Vizier Sadettin...

13:53.069 --> 13:54.749
We've been waiting for you, Governor.

13:55.709 --> 13:59.109
I wouldn't want to keep you waiting
but something came up.

13:59.629 --> 14:02.229
I need to be leaving soon,
so let's get this over with.

14:02.389 --> 14:04.109
Why the hurry, Ares?

14:04.509 --> 14:05.909
You look very worried.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.589
As if you saw a ghost.

14:14.869 --> 14:16.949
The contracts are ready, blessed vizier.

14:17.109 --> 14:18.149
Good.

14:19.109 --> 14:21.549
The governor is in a hurry,

14:21.669 --> 14:25.109
so let's complete the agreement
with us bearing witness.

14:58.829 --> 15:01.389
My Ertuğrul, my brave heart.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.789
We thought he was under the ground,

15:07.229 --> 15:09.749
but he was just out there
somewhere, struggling.

15:12.469 --> 15:16.189
We crushed his hopes and dreams...

15:18.229 --> 15:22.949
while he was away fighting evil.

15:25.829 --> 15:26.949
Mother,

15:29.509 --> 15:31.309
do not grieve any longer.

15:32.869 --> 15:34.309
My bey is back.

15:34.989 --> 15:37.309
Your son came back safe and unharmed.

15:37.949 --> 15:41.789
Who cares if the world burns now?

15:43.109 --> 15:45.549
Do not wear yourself out like this.

15:45.869 --> 15:49.989
You supported the decision
to reunite your sons.

15:51.349 --> 15:52.429
My girl,

15:53.949 --> 15:55.589
what if they sell the bazaar?

15:57.109 --> 15:59.549
How can we look Ertuğrul in the eye?

16:02.469 --> 16:05.029
What about Dündar? What will he do?

16:06.389 --> 16:07.709
Mother...

16:12.149 --> 16:13.309
My beautiful mother.

16:13.429 --> 16:15.829
Let the winds carry your worries away.

16:17.069 --> 16:19.069
Stop upsetting yourself now.

16:20.389 --> 16:24.069
My bey, your son, is back.
That's all that matters.

16:24.829 --> 16:29.069
And you'll see Ertuğrul Bey
will make it there in time.

16:29.429 --> 16:33.429
My girl, I'm thinking about Dündar,

16:34.349 --> 16:35.789
not myself.

16:36.589 --> 16:38.869
My only concern is for him.

16:41.549 --> 16:46.069
I'm afraid Ertuğrul won't forgive him
this time.

16:46.309 --> 16:51.429
Mother, don't you know how close
Ertuğrul Bey is to his brother?

16:52.509 --> 16:55.309
He does whatever is best for his brother.

17:01.829 --> 17:03.989
Every winter carries its spring, Mother.

17:05.389 --> 17:09.309
It's time to dispel the black clouds
above us.

17:16.989 --> 17:18.629
My beautiful daughter-in-law.

17:21.509 --> 17:23.829
You bravely stood your ground.

17:25.229 --> 17:27.229
You saw what was right and wrong.

17:29.789 --> 17:34.029
You showed what it really is
to be a wife of a bey<i>.</i>

17:35.509 --> 17:37.389
My beautiful daughter-in-law.

17:39.189 --> 17:41.909
We've learned how it is to be a wife
of a bey from you, Mother.

17:44.109 --> 17:46.149
May God bless you.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.189
Oh, my beautiful girl.

17:53.149 --> 17:55.189
Oh, my beautiful daughter-in-law.

17:58.629 --> 18:00.029
Dündar Bey,

18:00.429 --> 18:04.469
with this contract, Bahadır Bey
will stay loyal

18:04.869 --> 18:09.349
to the promises given to the traders
by Ertuğrul Bey.

18:10.949 --> 18:15.629
And governor Ares will assign
a skillful trader

18:16.029 --> 18:18.069
to help him out.

18:18.189 --> 18:21.029
They'll improve the bazaar together.

18:24.149 --> 18:26.029
And everyone will win.

18:26.229 --> 18:28.869
I'll stay loyal to the promise
I gave to Ertuğrul Bey.

18:28.989 --> 18:31.109
With the trader I'll assign,

18:31.189 --> 18:34.669
I'll convince Greek traders
to trade in these lands again.

18:56.629 --> 18:57.789
Finally.

18:58.949 --> 19:00.509
Let's get this over with.

20:08.469 --> 20:10.509
<i>We'll establish Islam here.</i>

20:10.989 --> 20:14.669
<i>Allah is everlasting!</i>

20:36.869 --> 20:40.549
We will make it a glorious inn,
having announced the call to prayer.

20:41.349 --> 20:42.829
Let the people know

20:42.989 --> 20:44.389
they are not to be afraid.

20:44.629 --> 20:46.189
The oppression has come to an end.

20:57.749 --> 21:01.349
Ertuğrul Bey<i>...</i>

21:11.629 --> 21:14.349
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

21:18.949 --> 21:22.349
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

21:23.509 --> 21:25.629
Long live Ertuğrul Bey.

21:39.869 --> 21:42.189
<i>Our bey is alive.</i>

21:43.829 --> 21:46.429
My Ertuğrul Bey! Ertuğrul Bey is alive.

21:56.069 --> 21:58.549
May it be for the best.

21:59.229 --> 22:04.189
Let this purchase be prosperous
for trade.

22:06.189 --> 22:08.349
There you go, Bahadır Bey.
Congratulations.

22:08.469 --> 22:10.709
Congratulations to all of us,
blessed vizier.

23:00.709 --> 23:01.869
Brother!

23:03.229 --> 23:04.749
Ertuğrul...

23:51.509 --> 23:52.829
Ertuğrul.

23:53.309 --> 23:55.509
A thousand thanks to God, Ertuğrul,

23:55.869 --> 23:57.629
that you are here with us.

23:59.549 --> 24:00.989
How did this happen?

24:01.949 --> 24:07.269
It seems I still have time to live
and to shorten the lives of my enemies,

24:09.629 --> 24:11.429
Vizier Sadettin.

24:12.389 --> 24:13.989
We all thought you were dead.

24:15.229 --> 24:17.029
We buried you.

24:18.949 --> 24:20.709
The body you buried was not mine,

24:21.309 --> 24:23.549
it was one of the ambushers'.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.589
Very well, very well.

24:32.789 --> 24:35.589
Where have you been
all this time, Ertuğrul Bey?

24:36.549 --> 24:39.789
I was captured by a slave trader.

24:42.509 --> 24:45.589
But thank God, I survived.

24:46.669 --> 24:47.709
I'm here now.

24:49.869 --> 24:50.749
Good.

24:51.309 --> 24:52.229
Good.

24:52.789 --> 24:54.349
Welcome back.

24:57.589 --> 25:02.189
We have just completed a good deal.

25:02.949 --> 25:06.269
I know my brother Dündar is here
to sell the bazaar.

25:08.589 --> 25:09.669
But...

25:11.549 --> 25:16.669
I also know that no one is to benefit
from the bad fortune of Kayi tribe.

25:18.909 --> 25:22.669
And that's why

25:23.149 --> 25:25.669
this agreement has no value to me.

25:31.669 --> 25:33.349
What are you saying, Ertuğrul Bey<i>?</i>

25:34.949 --> 25:38.669
Dündar Bey signed the contract
with the stamp of Kayi.

25:38.949 --> 25:44.029
He accepted the gold
in the presence of witnesses.

25:45.229 --> 25:50.549
As long as I hold this agreement
with the Kayi stamp on it,

25:52.389 --> 25:55.909
your words have no value, either.

26:05.389 --> 26:06.549
Ertuğrul!

26:22.509 --> 26:24.469
How could you disrespect my father!

26:31.909 --> 26:33.229
Ertuğrul!

26:49.349 --> 26:51.629
Why the hurry, Bahadır Bey?

26:53.429 --> 26:55.109
It seems you are sick

26:55.389 --> 27:00.149
of waiting to tear apart my dead body,
along with your son.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.389
Bahadır Bey.

27:12.509 --> 27:14.549
Keep your sword in its sheath.

27:21.709 --> 27:27.349
I am the margrave of these lands.

27:31.389 --> 27:35.149
The bazaar is my property.

27:36.389 --> 27:37.669
I'm not selling it.

27:40.189 --> 27:45.669
Either you make my hands dirty
with your blood

27:46.469 --> 27:48.669
or you obey me.

27:50.069 --> 27:55.469
The leader of Cavdars
does not obey anyone,

27:56.029 --> 27:57.749
Ertuğrul Bey!

28:01.149 --> 28:04.669
Then we will spare a place for you

28:04.789 --> 28:08.549
alongside your cousin Ural,
who refused to obey in the past.

28:12.749 --> 28:18.149
How could you let him
tear up the contract, blessed vizier?

28:20.709 --> 28:25.829
How could you rebel against a margrave?

28:29.589 --> 28:33.589
Ertuğrul Bey
is the margrave of these lands.

28:43.429 --> 28:44.509
Sancar Bey.

28:45.309 --> 28:48.349
Take your Alps and leave here at once.

28:53.269 --> 28:54.989
We'll deal with this matter

28:55.509 --> 29:00.309
calmly and collectively,
with Ertuğrul Bey.

29:03.749 --> 29:04.909
Hopefully.

29:10.069 --> 29:11.309
Turgut.

29:18.309 --> 29:19.509
Alps!

29:51.749 --> 29:53.349
Look here, Turgut.

29:54.909 --> 29:58.429
Don't think you'll be relieved
now that your bey is back.

29:59.789 --> 30:02.709
You'll be held responsible
for all your doings.

30:03.829 --> 30:06.949
From now on, think twice
before doing anything.

30:10.149 --> 30:11.429
Look at this halfwit!

30:11.709 --> 30:13.149
Just look at him!

30:13.309 --> 30:15.829
This ignorant halfwit!

30:16.589 --> 30:20.349
He's all talk!

30:28.669 --> 30:32.549
Don't think you coyotes have any chance
to roam freely.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.629
We will not let that happen,

30:37.469 --> 30:40.829
just as we didn't
while Ertuğrul Bey wasn't around.

30:42.589 --> 30:48.069
You, your bey and your tribe
still have a price to pay, Turgut.

30:50.309 --> 30:52.549
The amount is getting bigger and bigger.

30:53.469 --> 30:58.109
You will pay the price in blood
when the time comes.

31:02.349 --> 31:05.589
Your teeth are not strong enough
to chew us.

31:06.469 --> 31:09.029
Don't draw your swords
in the wrong places.

31:10.829 --> 31:13.949
You may end up cutting your own throats.

31:15.069 --> 31:21.469
Then we'll see the pool of blood.

31:24.029 --> 31:25.389
We'll see, Turgut.

31:26.509 --> 31:27.949
We will.

31:42.789 --> 31:46.109
Ertuğrul Bey, bandits took advantage
of your absence

31:46.429 --> 31:48.269
and attacked the traders.

31:48.389 --> 31:49.749
The bazaar's operations were disrupted.

31:50.389 --> 31:53.629
Both my people and the Turks
were harmed as the consequence.

31:55.069 --> 31:57.749
Bahadır Bey was going to buy the bazaar.

31:58.269 --> 32:01.869
Governor Ares was going to assign
a skillful trader

32:01.949 --> 32:04.029
who would improve ties with the Frankish.

32:04.149 --> 32:05.549
As for Dündar Bey,

32:05.909 --> 32:08.829
he stayed loyal to your wishes to the end.

32:09.749 --> 32:12.869
He protected the traders as per your wish.

32:13.469 --> 32:16.229
There is no reason to be angry or resent.

32:17.029 --> 32:18.869
In these turbulent times,

32:18.989 --> 32:21.229
I did my best to protect
both my own people's

32:21.349 --> 32:23.589
and the Turks' interests.

32:24.669 --> 32:25.869
Your death

32:26.389 --> 32:28.709
caused a weakness among Kayi tribe,
that's the issue.

32:28.869 --> 32:31.109
This weakness caused harm

32:31.509 --> 32:34.189
both to trade
and to the livelihoods of the people.

32:35.549 --> 32:39.589
They did the tough thing
by buying a dying bazaar.

32:41.109 --> 32:42.269
So if the operations

32:42.629 --> 32:45.269
of the bazaar were disrupted
while I was away,

32:45.829 --> 32:49.669
as the margrave it's my duty
to re-establish order

32:50.189 --> 32:53.229
in these lands.

32:55.789 --> 32:56.709
Governor Ares,

32:57.709 --> 33:03.469
we will meet and talk
about whatever is necessary

33:03.549 --> 33:05.109
to revive the trade in the bazaar.

33:06.469 --> 33:09.949
I'm sure you want
the best for your people, too.

33:13.629 --> 33:15.669
I'll come to your castle and talk to you.

33:17.189 --> 33:18.549
Now, you can leave.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.989
As for you, Bahadır Bey...

33:33.029 --> 33:34.229
Tomorrow,

33:34.949 --> 33:38.189
I'll gather the council in the bazaar.

33:40.589 --> 33:41.749
I'll question your son,

33:42.549 --> 33:44.269
for he drew his sword

33:45.109 --> 33:46.469
to the margrave.

33:47.669 --> 33:49.269
As for your tribe...

33:49.669 --> 33:51.629
I'll make the decision about your tribe
during the meeting.

33:55.029 --> 33:56.509
I'm the only one

33:57.109 --> 34:00.389
who can make decisions about my tribe.

34:00.909 --> 34:02.069
Then,

34:02.829 --> 34:04.389
your will to decide

34:04.989 --> 34:07.389
will be at the mercy of my sword,
Bahadır Bey.

34:12.389 --> 34:13.669
You can leave now.

34:25.389 --> 34:26.509
Bahadır Bey.

34:27.189 --> 34:28.909
Don't forget your precious gold.

34:35.269 --> 34:36.189
Alps!

34:39.989 --> 34:40.949
Take the box.

35:07.789 --> 35:08.949
Bring my horse!

35:25.389 --> 35:27.309
<i>You've cut each other’s throats now,</i>
<i>damn Turks.</i>

35:27.829 --> 35:29.029
<i>Let us be ridden of you all.</i>

35:29.149 --> 35:32.509
<i>You cut each other today,</i>
<i>tomorrow I'll cut you all anyway.</i>

35:33.469 --> 35:35.309
We're leaving!

35:41.989 --> 35:43.189
<i>Shame on you!</i>

35:48.029 --> 35:50.869
How did the order of the bazaar
go sideways, Vizier Sadettin?

35:51.389 --> 35:53.349
Why didn't you take precautions?

35:54.109 --> 35:56.989
How could you let the bandits be

35:57.469 --> 35:58.989
while they didn't let the people be?

35:59.709 --> 36:02.349
Do you hold me responsible
for what happened, Ertuğrul?

36:03.429 --> 36:05.029
You couldn't find those

36:05.709 --> 36:07.949
who ambushed me and killed my Alps.

36:09.509 --> 36:13.629
You failed to prevent the Turkish tribes
from going into turmoil while I was away.

36:13.789 --> 36:18.949
I had my soldiers
chase the bandits for days.

36:19.509 --> 36:21.789
I questioned those we captured.

36:22.029 --> 36:24.989
I did my best to find

36:25.069 --> 36:27.269
who did this to you and your Alps.

36:28.149 --> 36:30.509
Dündar is the primary witness
of my efforts.

36:34.109 --> 36:37.229
Our Sultan assigned you to take care

36:37.469 --> 36:39.949
of these lands while I was away.

36:41.629 --> 36:42.909
And what did you do?

36:45.189 --> 36:48.149
You convinced my brother
to sell the bazaar

36:48.269 --> 36:50.789
for which we lost so many soldiers.

36:54.869 --> 36:58.869
Instead of preventing him from emigrating,
you encouraged him.

37:01.029 --> 37:04.549
Don't tell me you were doing your job.

37:06.309 --> 37:09.109
I'm happy you are alive, Ertuğrul.

37:11.869 --> 37:15.189
Don't dampen my happiness

37:15.909 --> 37:18.029
with your rage.

37:22.549 --> 37:24.909
You'll be my guest at the council tomorrow
for the last time.

37:27.669 --> 37:28.829
I'm back.

37:30.189 --> 37:32.989
Your job here is done.

37:35.349 --> 37:36.429
Don't you dare

37:37.149 --> 37:39.029
enter my territory again.

37:42.909 --> 37:44.269
Now,

37:44.749 --> 37:47.989
I represent the state in these lands.

37:59.389 --> 38:03.429
Even the shadow of my bey
is enough to scare them off.

38:03.669 --> 38:07.229
Let's see how that devil,
so called Bahadır,

38:07.389 --> 38:09.189
talks from now on.

38:27.789 --> 38:31.749
So, let's start your wedding preparations
with Lady Aslıhan then.

38:31.869 --> 38:37.869
Let's have a legendary wedding for you,
so that our enemies envy you

38:38.109 --> 38:40.909
and lose their minds over it.

38:43.269 --> 38:46.229
Just an order of Ertuğrul Bey
would be enough, brother.

38:48.829 --> 38:50.789
No one has the power to prevent it

38:51.109 --> 38:52.989
once he gives the go ahead.

39:28.829 --> 39:29.949
Brother...

39:33.269 --> 39:34.469
I made a mistake.

39:35.229 --> 39:36.429
Forgive me.

39:37.269 --> 39:38.669
I caused all this turmoil.

39:45.509 --> 39:47.269
You surrendered willingly

39:48.189 --> 39:52.349
and knowingly
because of your stupidity, Dündar!

39:54.109 --> 39:55.989
How can you ask for forgiveness?

39:56.389 --> 39:58.109
-Brother--
-Don't!

40:02.149 --> 40:03.389
Don't call me brother!

40:04.669 --> 40:05.669
I'll make you

40:06.389 --> 40:09.029
and those who supported you
pay for this!

40:24.589 --> 40:26.509
-Turgut.
-Yes, my bey.

40:26.709 --> 40:28.629
Go to Cavdar tribe at once.

40:28.749 --> 40:30.189
Let Lady Aslıhan know

40:30.669 --> 40:33.789
that once Bahadır Bey's tribe
reaches our lands,

40:34.309 --> 40:36.389
there will be a council meeting
for the leadership.

40:38.229 --> 40:41.789
Tomorrow, we'll be having
a council meeting in the bazaar.

40:42.509 --> 40:43.749
Lady Aslıhan is also invited.

40:45.389 --> 40:46.709
The sentence for Sancar Bey,

40:47.069 --> 40:50.949
who drew his sword to the margrave,
will be decided tomorrow.

40:51.989 --> 40:53.709
Carry my exact words.

40:56.269 --> 40:57.629
Yes, my bey.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.349
Good.

42:31.629 --> 42:33.029
Make way.

43:00.389 --> 43:02.229
<i>Oh, this bastard.</i>

43:06.349 --> 43:07.869
So you are here.

43:08.309 --> 43:09.749
Let's see where you're going.

43:25.029 --> 43:27.389
Commander Ares, I've got news for you.

43:27.829 --> 43:29.829
You couldn't catch a single man,

43:29.909 --> 43:32.309
yet still you are here speaking nonsense!

43:32.509 --> 43:35.069
-It's important, sir.
-Get inside!

43:41.869 --> 43:44.069
Those bastards.

43:44.429 --> 43:47.069
<i>You'll pay for your dirty tricks.</i>

43:47.309 --> 43:49.829
<i>For sure you'll come out of that hole.</i>

43:50.149 --> 43:52.669
<i>You still have things to explain</i>
<i>to Ertuğrul Bey.</i>

44:01.149 --> 44:03.429
My Ertuğrul Bey is coming!

44:03.509 --> 44:09.949
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

44:12.429 --> 44:17.429
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

44:30.869 --> 44:37.709
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

44:46.429 --> 44:48.989
Praise be to God, who brings the morning
after the dark night,

44:50.189 --> 44:52.949
and who ends the winter with the spring.

44:55.229 --> 44:57.109
I've heard about the bandit problem.

44:58.269 --> 45:01.429
These are the tricks of the devil.

45:02.709 --> 45:04.269
Don't despair.

45:05.589 --> 45:08.229
Don't be fooled by their ticks.

45:09.309 --> 45:14.109
As long as you appreciate your lands,
properties, and our bazaar

45:14.629 --> 45:19.069
and work hard,
these tricks will become useless.

45:19.789 --> 45:21.989
And our income will be
even more prosperous.

45:22.789 --> 45:24.109
Hopefully.

45:25.349 --> 45:27.949
This I promise as your margrave.

45:29.509 --> 45:32.789
The bandit problem will be solved
in no time.

45:33.549 --> 45:35.069
Hopefully.

45:36.629 --> 45:37.789
Our Sultan,

45:38.469 --> 45:40.549
and I, as the margrave,

45:40.789 --> 45:42.069
are always there for you.

45:43.189 --> 45:46.589
You'll be working and trading
in an environment of peace.

45:47.229 --> 45:53.509
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

45:55.549 --> 46:00.309
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

46:11.749 --> 46:17.429
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

46:28.029 --> 46:29.669
How did Ertuğrul manage

46:29.829 --> 46:32.949
to get away from you and the slave traders
all by himself, Yorgo?

46:33.229 --> 46:35.069
He didn't, sir. He was rescued.

46:35.309 --> 46:36.549
Rescued?

46:36.709 --> 46:37.669
By whom?

46:38.189 --> 46:41.469
-I don't know who, but--
-But what!

46:43.069 --> 46:44.909
They were no ordinary men, sir.

46:45.109 --> 46:46.309
They came prepared.

46:46.549 --> 46:49.149
-They were master warriors.
-What do you mean?

46:49.429 --> 46:52.709
Ertuğrul is protected by certain people
who are unknown to us, sir.

46:53.109 --> 46:55.389
Ertuğrul doesn't know
I'm the mastermind behind all this!

46:56.109 --> 46:58.029
I'll use this to my advantage!

46:58.149 --> 46:59.869
I'm just getting started!

47:00.629 --> 47:02.629
And I'll not deliver the bazaar to him!

47:03.229 --> 47:05.509
A trader is coming from Nicaea.
His name is Niko.

47:06.029 --> 47:07.389
He'll be here in a couple of days.

47:07.789 --> 47:10.309
We need him to incapacitate the bazaar.

47:10.389 --> 47:12.629
He needs to get here safe and sound.
Understood?

47:12.789 --> 47:14.989
Take your men and accompany him.

47:15.069 --> 47:16.349
And don't be seen by anyone.

47:16.669 --> 47:18.709
-Yes, sir.
-Get out!

47:43.309 --> 47:44.709
<i>Someone is coming!</i>

47:52.229 --> 47:56.149
Ertuğrul Bey! Welcome, my bey!

48:04.989 --> 48:08.589
Long live my bey! Welcome!

48:10.029 --> 48:12.029
Long live my bey!

48:19.749 --> 48:21.869
Thank God.

48:24.509 --> 48:26.029
Thank God.

48:58.789 --> 49:01.189
Long live my bey!
Long live my Ertuğrul Bey!

49:05.309 --> 49:06.669
<i>God bless you my bey!</i>

49:07.149 --> 49:08.869
Brave hearts of Kayi tribe!

49:09.229 --> 49:10.069
People of Kayi!

49:10.789 --> 49:12.709
I know there is a bleeding wound...

49:14.189 --> 49:16.389
in each of your hearts.

49:17.789 --> 49:19.189
But don't you worry.

49:21.589 --> 49:25.109
The bazaar still belongs to the Kayi!

49:27.789 --> 49:31.229
God bless you! Long live my bey!

49:40.389 --> 49:42.069
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

49:44.229 --> 49:47.429
What kind of Kayi beys are you...

49:48.509 --> 49:50.389
that you decided to give in

49:51.029 --> 49:53.509
when the hard times came,
instead of resisting?

49:54.229 --> 49:55.589
Forgive us, my bey.

49:55.709 --> 49:56.789
We thought you were dead.

50:00.869 --> 50:02.469
Even if I die,

50:03.189 --> 50:04.589
the cause still lives!

50:06.149 --> 50:07.429
This cause...

50:08.149 --> 50:09.389
is the cause of God!

50:10.669 --> 50:12.549
It began long ago

50:12.909 --> 50:14.989
and it will exist forever!

50:17.189 --> 50:18.389
When our prophet...

50:20.069 --> 50:21.589
went to the afterlife,

50:22.189 --> 50:25.389
what did Ebubekir say to his friends

50:26.069 --> 50:30.029
who went into despair?

50:33.709 --> 50:35.349
"Muhammad

50:36.029 --> 50:38.389
was just a messenger of God.

50:39.789 --> 50:43.149
There have been many other prophets
who have come and gone.

50:45.469 --> 50:49.189
Now, if he is to die or to be killed

50:50.309 --> 50:52.309
will you step back from his cause?

50:56.189 --> 50:59.429
Whoever steps back...

51:00.789 --> 51:02.789
cannot harm God.

51:05.149 --> 51:09.309
Yet God will reward those
who feel gratitude."

51:11.549 --> 51:13.869
They didn't step back from the cause
they believed in.

51:14.789 --> 51:18.949
They waved the flags of justice
in every corner of the world.

51:21.989 --> 51:23.349
And you?

51:26.069 --> 51:27.269
What did you do?

51:33.349 --> 51:34.669
Let this be known:

51:35.429 --> 51:39.429
the Kayi is not defined by Ertuğrul Bey!

51:41.229 --> 51:43.989
Those who embrace the cause of God...

51:45.229 --> 51:47.509
stand their ground

51:47.669 --> 51:49.709
even if flames rain on them.

51:52.189 --> 51:55.429
Yet you all failed to stand your ground.

51:57.829 --> 51:58.949
This is my order!

52:02.149 --> 52:06.389
Dündar Bey and other beys
who supported him

52:07.589 --> 52:08.989
are no longer beys.

52:15.749 --> 52:19.469
Your wish is our command, my bey.
We're just grateful you are alive.

52:25.189 --> 52:26.629
As you order, my bey.

52:34.149 --> 52:37.309
Let this be an example for everyone!

52:38.509 --> 52:40.949
Those who don't stay loyal to the cause...

52:41.429 --> 52:43.549
and don't stand their ground...

52:44.229 --> 52:46.669
are not welcome in this tribe!

52:50.469 --> 52:55.829
Those who want to leave can leave now!

52:56.589 --> 53:00.669
Your way is our way, Ertuğrul Bey!
Your path is our path!

53:06.229 --> 53:09.269
I'll wait for you in my tent, Dündar.
Come and see me.

54:28.461 --> 54:30.541
How could they lose themselves like this?

54:31.981 --> 54:34.341
How could they
draw swords on a frontier bey?

54:40.261 --> 54:45.341
Ertuğrul Bey will give the decision about
Sancar in the feast of beys tomorrow.

54:46.901 --> 54:51.901
Bahadir Bey will listen to no decision,
Turgut Alp. He'll do anything for his son.

54:52.101 --> 54:56.901
I remember well how he stood up against
my father and the oba once.

54:58.581 --> 55:02.501
You saw how he got the support of
Emir Sadettin.

55:02.981 --> 55:06.421
He got to my beys too
and persuaded them to a feast!

55:06.661 --> 55:10.901
Turgut, I don't know
how to stop him anymore.

55:13.101 --> 55:15.901
Ertuğrul Bey wishes you
to postpone the feast.

55:18.301 --> 55:21.701
The beys support him. How can I do that?

55:21.941 --> 55:24.701
Tell your beys,
"It is Ertuğrul Bey's command,

55:24.981 --> 55:28.981
there won't be a feast
until Bahadir's oba arrives."

55:31.981 --> 55:34.381
Ertuğrul Bey has thought this through.

55:34.901 --> 55:37.901
Since the two tribes
of the Cavdars are to unite,

55:38.261 --> 55:42.781
the beys of the two Cavdar obas
should come together and decide.

55:45.341 --> 55:47.541
This will buy us time.

55:47.861 --> 55:50.861
My bey wishes to see you too
at the feast tomorrow, Aslıhan Hatun.

55:53.461 --> 55:56.221
Ertuğrul Bey's wish is my command.

55:56.581 --> 56:00.901
Go and tell him,
"Aslıhan Hatun will do what's necessary."

56:01.221 --> 56:06.821
Neither my alps nor my people
will turn their backs on Ertuğrul Bey.

56:07.421 --> 56:10.901
So long as Ertuğrul Bey is here.

56:12.861 --> 56:14.941
So long as you are next to me.

56:16.621 --> 56:18.181
Your oba is my oba...

56:19.981 --> 56:22.141
Your life is my life, Aslıhan Hatun.

56:23.701 --> 56:30.261
I will allow neither him nor his son
to ignite the fire of unrest in our obas.

56:31.821 --> 56:33.421
Don't you worry.

57:04.181 --> 57:05.341
My brave sons.

57:07.541 --> 57:10.621
I was in agony longing for you.

57:12.381 --> 57:15.021
Now, even if they gave me the world...

57:15.661 --> 57:17.781
I wouldn't exchange this for anything.

57:30.021 --> 57:32.581
Father, when will you take me hunting?

57:34.341 --> 57:37.221
We will go, my son. We will go.

57:37.741 --> 57:40.141
From now on, we will always be together.

57:40.741 --> 57:43.781
We will go to your little brother's
first hunt too

57:43.901 --> 57:47.341
and ride into your first battle
together too, God willing.

57:49.421 --> 57:50.821
God willing.

57:52.981 --> 57:56.741
My Gündüz was so brave
while you were gone.

57:58.461 --> 58:01.501
You should have seen him
swearing for revenge,

58:01.661 --> 58:03.501
he roared like a lion.

58:04.541 --> 58:06.901
He was the one
who fought our cause the most.

58:10.901 --> 58:12.301
My Gündüz...

58:13.101 --> 58:15.661
is my trusted one, my source of pride.

58:19.981 --> 58:22.741
While this innocent boy's heart
is aflame

58:22.981 --> 58:25.461
our cause could
never be left undone, Halime.

58:27.501 --> 58:32.181
My Gündüz's heart is larger than Dündar
and those witless beys.

58:40.781 --> 58:44.421
Gündüz, go to Aktolga, my son.

58:44.581 --> 58:47.381
I won't go.
I'm going to stay with my father.

58:48.821 --> 58:49.901
Gündüz.

58:50.301 --> 58:53.421
There is more to being an alp
than the sword.

58:54.741 --> 58:56.981
Come, tend a little to Aktolga.

58:58.381 --> 59:01.701
Without being a fellow to your horse,
you can't be an alp.

59:02.101 --> 59:04.221
As you wish, my bey.

59:05.341 --> 59:06.581
Run along then.

59:08.901 --> 59:10.661
I'd die for him.

59:20.221 --> 59:21.501
Ertuğrul.

59:23.181 --> 59:25.501
Dündar made a bad choice.

59:26.541 --> 59:28.181
I stood against him.

59:29.701 --> 59:31.141
He made a mistake.

59:33.141 --> 59:35.661
You stripped him of his beyhood
in front of everyone.

59:36.981 --> 59:38.861
Why don't you go easy on him now.

59:39.821 --> 59:43.341
Things are not what they seem, Halime.

59:44.421 --> 59:48.781
There are bigger forces at play beneath
this market and immigration business.

59:49.741 --> 59:51.301
What are you saying, Ertuğrul?

59:54.341 --> 59:56.221
The hungry wolves have gathered.

00:59:57.661 --> 01:00:03.141
My brother and the witless beys
were about to be fed to them.

01:00:05.461 --> 01:00:06.861
We stopped it for now.

01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:11.621
However, the game is still on.

01:00:15.781 --> 01:00:21.981
Dündar will learn
what his foolishness has cost.

01:00:23.381 --> 01:00:24.821
He will pay the price.

01:00:52.021 --> 01:00:53.581
Eminence.

01:00:53.861 --> 01:00:58.581
Even if an outcast from my oba is harmed
I would make that man regret he was born.

01:00:59.021 --> 01:01:01.941
That Ertuğrul slew my alps
in front of my eyes.

01:01:02.301 --> 01:01:06.341
Give me permission to slaughter him
with my hands and feed him to the ravens.

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:15.341
Whether we like it or not, Ertuğrul Bey
is the frontier bey of these lands.

01:01:16.301 --> 01:01:19.781
If you stand up to a frontier bey,
you will deal with the consequences.

01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:23.541
Forget it, it's in the past.

01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:27.141
Now, be patient, it is time for patience.

01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:31.381
Eminence, not even a dog
can stomach what he did.

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:36.541
I cannot be patient. Give me permission,
I will take his head off.

01:01:37.341 --> 01:01:38.621
Bahadir Bey.

01:01:38.741 --> 01:01:41.541
When rage is high, all logic is lost.

01:01:42.661 --> 01:01:45.341
Learn to take control of your anger first.

01:01:45.981 --> 01:01:50.141
The sultan will soon call me to Konya.
What will you do when I'm gone?

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:54.741
Ertuğrul is the frontier bey of this land.
Do you think he will let you stay here?

01:01:56.981 --> 01:02:02.661
It is up to Ertuğrul
to let you settle here. Don't you see?

01:02:05.821 --> 01:02:08.021
I see, Eminence.

01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:09.581
Good.

01:02:11.181 --> 01:02:12.581
Now, quickly get to your oba.

01:02:13.421 --> 01:02:16.221
Gather your beys in the morning
and hold the feast.

01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:18.741
Become the bey.

01:02:20.061 --> 01:02:22.141
When you get to Ertuğrul,

01:02:22.261 --> 01:02:26.021
he will have nothing to say to you
as you will be the bey of the Cavdar.

01:02:27.741 --> 01:02:30.541
As you wish, Eminence.

01:02:56.821 --> 01:03:00.341
When I sat on this hide,
I had but one goal.

01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:05.661
To take my homeland further than
where Suleyman Shah had carried it.

01:03:16.701 --> 01:03:17.901
I was left without ancestors.

01:03:18.981 --> 01:03:25.021
But I did not leave my oba leaderless,
helpless and run away!

01:03:28.181 --> 01:03:29.221
What did my...

01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:32.181
beloved brother do?

01:03:33.541 --> 01:03:39.821
Just because the bey died he tried to bury
the memory of all those people and run.

01:03:42.461 --> 01:03:43.861
Whatever punishment you see fit...

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:47.501
I will take on, brother.

01:03:49.541 --> 01:03:50.621
I...

01:03:53.141 --> 01:03:54.621
I am not you, brother.

01:03:55.421 --> 01:03:58.821
I am not as powerful, as brave as you.

01:04:00.301 --> 01:04:01.701
I did what I could.

01:04:04.021 --> 01:04:07.741
I was afraid the Kayi would fall apart.
I was afraid I couldn't handle them.

01:04:15.501 --> 01:04:18.101
Son.

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:20.261
If there is a fault, it falls on us all.

01:04:21.021 --> 01:04:22.501
Stay out of this, Mother.

01:04:23.381 --> 01:04:27.741
The one who assumes beyhood
should be ready to pay the price!

01:04:38.501 --> 01:04:39.701
You!

01:04:40.621 --> 01:04:43.061
You were the flag-bearer of a cause!

01:04:43.821 --> 01:04:45.581
Did you not know our way at all?

01:04:47.181 --> 01:04:49.221
Everything went awry
in your absence, brother.

01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:52.421
Hanlı Bazaar's order was disturbed.

01:04:52.781 --> 01:04:55.661
Bandits hit the caravans.
We couldn't take them down.

01:04:57.181 --> 01:04:59.021
Tekfur Ares came to the market.

01:04:59.981 --> 01:05:03.381
He said he would pull out his merchants
if I didn't sell the market.

01:05:03.661 --> 01:05:05.781
Ameer Sadettin backed me into selling.

01:05:06.221 --> 01:05:10.181
I had no other choice.

01:05:13.501 --> 01:05:16.221
You know who Tekfur Ares is, Dündar?

01:05:17.661 --> 01:05:21.181
Tekfur Ares is the one who ambushed me
and my alps and killed them!

01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:25.541
What did you say, son?

01:05:29.021 --> 01:05:30.701
Foul bastard!

01:05:33.341 --> 01:05:34.621
Brother...

01:05:34.941 --> 01:05:36.301
How could I have known?

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:41.621
Forgive me.

01:05:44.381 --> 01:05:46.581
What's been said here
will be kept a secret.

01:05:47.781 --> 01:05:49.301
I have things to attend to.

01:05:51.461 --> 01:05:52.821
Now, we wait.

01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:57.861
When the time comes,
everything will be dealt with.

01:06:03.461 --> 01:06:05.341
This shame is too heavy for me, brother.

01:06:06.381 --> 01:06:07.741
Give the order...

01:06:08.461 --> 01:06:11.981
I will get that bastard's head
to make up for my faults.

01:06:12.541 --> 01:06:13.941
You're going to take his head, eh?

01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:22.141
I will fight together with the ones
who gave their hearts to my cause.

01:06:23.541 --> 01:06:27.501
However, you have no place in that fight.

01:06:32.501 --> 01:06:34.061
It is my order...

01:06:36.981 --> 01:06:38.181
gather your things.

01:06:44.341 --> 01:06:46.821
Get to my brothers' oba in haste.

01:06:47.301 --> 01:06:51.221
Tell them
that your brother Ertuğrul is alive,

01:06:52.741 --> 01:06:54.581
so they don't mourn for their sibling.

01:06:56.941 --> 01:07:01.061
And don't return to this oba
until I send word.

01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:06.821
Son...

01:07:15.421 --> 01:07:16.621
As you command, my bey.

01:07:23.341 --> 01:07:25.141
We have a rough war awaiting us.

01:07:26.661 --> 01:07:32.021
There is no place in it
for the faint-hearted or the weak-minded.

01:08:48.341 --> 01:08:49.661
Who are you?

01:08:52.781 --> 01:08:53.861
You!

01:09:01.221 --> 01:09:03.101
-Guards!
-What's that?

01:09:13.381 --> 01:09:16.341
God forbid, my bey,
if anything happened to you

01:09:16.501 --> 01:09:18.941
we saw what would become of us.

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:22.341
Everyone will have learned
their lesson from it.

01:09:24.701 --> 01:09:27.061
You sought our cause in my absence.

01:09:29.781 --> 01:09:31.141
You did not leave the path.

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:33.901
Thank you, my beys.

01:09:34.941 --> 01:09:38.141
Thank you, too.
Ever be here to lead us, my bey.

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:42.501
Until we find who ambushed you
and our alps and make him pay,

01:09:42.661 --> 01:09:45.301
may God not let us rest, my bey.

01:09:46.101 --> 01:09:48.261
I know who ambushed me.

01:09:52.261 --> 01:09:53.861
Who was it, my bey?

01:09:55.301 --> 01:09:56.501
Tekfur Ares.

01:09:58.701 --> 01:10:01.301
My bey, then...

01:10:01.541 --> 01:10:04.421
Then what are we waiting for,
my bey? To war!

01:10:05.261 --> 01:10:07.981
Let's take that bastard infidel's head.

01:10:08.981 --> 01:10:12.661
That scoundrel! Let us get to his fort
right away and give him what's coming.

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.101
Make him pay.

01:10:14.741 --> 01:10:19.461
Let us hang that dog from the walls of
Karacahisar and make an example of him.

01:10:19.981 --> 01:10:24.421
I will set up the one who set us up
with the biggest of ambushes, Turgut.

01:10:27.021 --> 01:10:30.341
I will catch him off-guard
at his own fort.

01:10:32.781 --> 01:10:37.461
I will not let him hide behind his lies,

01:10:37.621 --> 01:10:40.661
his deceit or his walls.

01:10:52.741 --> 01:10:56.301
It's Commander Yorgo. Commander Yorgo?

01:10:57.301 --> 01:10:58.981
Send word to the fort.

01:11:21.541 --> 01:11:24.141
I will write a letter to our sultan
explaining everything.

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:29.381
We will get everything ready
by the time the firman to conquer arrives.

01:11:30.461 --> 01:11:35.261
But my bey,
why didn't you behead that infidel today?

01:11:37.021 --> 01:11:42.261
I wanted to see if he had anything
to do with Ameer Sadettin, Bamsi.

01:11:44.461 --> 01:11:46.621
I will act as if I know nothing.

01:11:48.101 --> 01:11:50.621
Meanwhile, we will begin preparations
to conquer.

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:56.501
We will go visit the fort.
I will reach out in fellowship.

01:11:57.741 --> 01:12:01.661
When we are there,
we will inspect the fort thoroughly.

01:12:02.381 --> 01:12:04.581
We will see how fortified it is.

01:12:06.501 --> 01:12:11.181
If they fight us from behind the walls

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.141
the emperor will send help.

01:12:16.701 --> 01:12:18.421
The siege will last for months.

01:12:18.941 --> 01:12:22.541
We will raid it off guard.

01:12:22.941 --> 01:12:25.661
We will catch them as if in their sleep.

01:12:25.901 --> 01:12:27.861
With you leading us, my bey...

01:12:28.421 --> 01:12:32.061
we have no fear of the enemy,
no doubt of victory.

01:12:33.021 --> 01:12:35.741
None, my bey, none. Oh, my heart!

01:12:35.901 --> 01:12:38.661
It runs wild like a horse, my bey.

01:12:38.861 --> 01:12:41.901
May God permit me to see
the day we take it, my bey.

01:12:43.941 --> 01:12:49.501
We had been left to rust in your absence.
Now we are sharp as honed swords, my bey.

01:12:59.301 --> 01:13:04.021
Our cause is to engrave God's justice
onto even the smallest stone.

01:13:06.101 --> 01:13:07.901
Now, we fight for this cause.

01:13:10.141 --> 01:13:14.981
The firman is from our sultan,
martyrdom is from God.

01:13:16.221 --> 01:13:19.261
May God be with us and help us.

01:13:19.421 --> 01:13:22.781
Yes, Ertuğrul Bey. As you command.

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:40.821
Ertuğrul...

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:48.541
He is to decide about my son
and my oba in front of the beys tomorrow.

01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:52.421
Let's see what his decision will be.

01:13:53.141 --> 01:13:55.981
Who does he think he is
to decide in front of the beys?

01:13:56.381 --> 01:14:00.141
After all his impertinence,
what business do we have there?

01:14:01.101 --> 01:14:03.021
Let's not go, so he'll be humiliated.

01:14:06.941 --> 01:14:10.221
Don't get involved in things
you don't understand, Sancar.

01:14:11.701 --> 01:14:14.661
I want Ertuğrul's head more than you do.

01:14:15.221 --> 01:14:18.381
Alas, everything has its time.

01:14:18.781 --> 01:14:21.301
He humiliated us in front of everyone.

01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:24.421
To top it off, he slew our alps.

01:14:25.341 --> 01:14:28.181
-I can no longer take it.
-Sancar!

01:14:29.741 --> 01:14:33.421
Don't do something crazy.
This is a serious matter.

01:14:35.461 --> 01:14:37.661
It is time to think with your head.

01:14:40.021 --> 01:14:42.421
Ertuğrul said that he will decide

01:14:42.581 --> 01:14:45.061
both about you and our oba
at the feast of beys tomorrow.

01:14:47.021 --> 01:14:48.221
Don't you get that?

01:14:49.101 --> 01:14:53.581
It would not benefit us to stand back,
Father. We cannot bow to his threats.

01:14:54.381 --> 01:14:57.821
Tomorrow morning, at our oba's feast,
Bahadir Bey will sit in our marquee.

01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:03.941
Bahadir Bey will arrive at Ertuğrul Bey's
feast as the bey of the unified Cavdars.

01:15:06.581 --> 01:15:08.621
Then, he will decide accordingly.

01:15:09.661 --> 01:15:11.061
Oh, Sancar!

01:15:12.301 --> 01:15:14.901
If only you had half the wit my hatun has.

01:15:18.341 --> 01:15:22.181
Do you think I will stomach
what Ertuğrul has done?

01:15:27.461 --> 01:15:31.341
Let him play sovereign for now.

01:15:32.981 --> 01:15:37.501
I will make the real decision
once the time comes.

01:15:43.101 --> 01:15:45.181
<i>Permission to enter, Bahadir Bey.</i>

01:15:50.621 --> 01:15:52.421
Come in, Kırca.

01:15:57.381 --> 01:16:01.341
Aslıhan Hatun wishes to see you
with the beys at her marquee, Bahadir Bey.

01:16:13.621 --> 01:16:16.181
What is that impudent woman up to now?

01:16:16.901 --> 01:16:18.461
Let us go and see.

01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:39.101
You'll be of great use to us, bastard.
You will confess to everything.

01:17:25.301 --> 01:17:26.581
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>

01:17:26.701 --> 01:17:28.621
<i>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

01:17:33.461 --> 01:17:35.141
Come, sit, Bahadir Bey.

01:17:36.141 --> 01:17:41.021
I consulted with my beys on a matter.
I wanted you to participate as well.

01:18:01.661 --> 01:18:03.541
What's is it, Aslıhan Hatun?

01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:07.461
What did you consult without informing me?

01:18:09.301 --> 01:18:11.821
I have things to say about the feast,
Bahadir Bey.

01:18:13.861 --> 01:18:16.181
I have postponed our oba's feast
for beyhood,

01:18:16.301 --> 01:18:19.061
with permission from Ertuğrul Bey.

01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:28.741
When your oba arrives, the beys
of the two fellow obas will sit...

01:18:29.261 --> 01:18:31.101
and choose the Cavdar's bey.

01:18:33.741 --> 01:18:38.141
You have no authority
or power to do that, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:18:39.541 --> 01:18:43.741
You've had the Cavdars be belittled
following Ertuğrul's tail long enough.

01:18:45.741 --> 01:18:48.021
I will no longer allow it.

01:18:48.821 --> 01:18:51.501
The feast for beyhood
will be held in the morning.

01:19:05.461 --> 01:19:07.421
You cowards!

01:19:10.861 --> 01:19:12.461
What is this, Bahadir Bey?

01:19:16.061 --> 01:19:18.301
Will you rebel against me too?

01:19:20.861 --> 01:19:22.541
Will you stab me too?

01:19:26.581 --> 01:19:29.021
I heard that your son and your alps...

01:19:29.461 --> 01:19:32.501
stood up to our frontier bey
and drew their swords on him.

01:19:33.781 --> 01:19:37.261
You sacrificed two alps in your fury.

01:19:40.061 --> 01:19:44.381
Still, you come before me and think that
I will surrender my oba to you.

01:19:45.061 --> 01:19:46.941
Alas, you are wrong.

01:19:47.741 --> 01:19:50.261
Just wait till our Ertuğrul Bey
makes his decision,

01:19:50.541 --> 01:19:54.581
then we will decide what to do together.

01:19:56.821 --> 01:20:00.461
We decided to hold a feast with the beys.

01:20:01.541 --> 01:20:06.181
-Why does Ertuğrul meddle in our feast?
-He is not just a frontier bey.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:11.621
Ertuğrul Bey has defended our oba's honor
and given many a life for it.

01:20:12.261 --> 01:20:15.781
Do not make us choose
between the two of you.

01:20:16.341 --> 01:20:17.821
You will lose.

01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:23.901
It will be as our Ertuğrul Bey has said.

01:20:24.101 --> 01:20:27.381
Those who don't like my decision
may leave my marquee.

01:20:36.661 --> 01:20:39.341
This feast will be held sooner or later.

01:20:40.181 --> 01:20:42.901
My oba will settle here.

01:20:43.541 --> 01:20:45.821
I will become the bey of all the Cavdars.

01:20:49.141 --> 01:20:53.101
You cannot deprive me of my oba
by coercing with Ertuğrul.

01:20:54.821 --> 01:20:59.781
Now, those beys who trust me, follow me.

01:21:03.741 --> 01:21:07.061
The rest, what a shame...

01:21:51.461 --> 01:21:53.101
<i>May I come in, mother?</i>

01:21:54.021 --> 01:21:56.061
Come in, my son. Come in.

01:22:03.221 --> 01:22:04.581
Mother.

01:22:07.181 --> 01:22:08.701
The apple of my eye.

01:22:10.661 --> 01:22:13.741
My son, the lion of great mountains.

01:22:14.741 --> 01:22:16.541
Forgive me, mother.

01:22:17.021 --> 01:22:19.501
I haven't been able to tend to you
since I returned.

01:22:26.461 --> 01:22:28.901
I'd die for a single hair on your head.

01:22:31.941 --> 01:22:35.861
Son, you are our only safeguard.

01:22:37.181 --> 01:22:38.701
Just you lead us.

01:22:41.341 --> 01:22:44.381
You came back, that's enough for me.

01:22:50.261 --> 01:22:51.661
What are these, Mother?

01:22:56.021 --> 01:22:58.381
Yours, Dündar's...

01:22:59.781 --> 01:23:02.541
your brothers' first caps.

01:23:07.781 --> 01:23:09.661
I sewed them with my own hands.

01:23:14.021 --> 01:23:15.941
Your brothers left us.

01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:22.501
You sent Dündar away.

01:23:25.141 --> 01:23:26.821
My heart is in pieces.

01:23:29.261 --> 01:23:32.661
I look at these and love you
as if all of you were here.

01:23:35.541 --> 01:23:37.021
Mother...

01:23:37.821 --> 01:23:39.341
Dündar is naive.

01:23:40.821 --> 01:23:42.261
He needs to mature.

01:23:43.461 --> 01:23:44.901
I did what was necessary.

01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:52.181
He will learn that there is a price for
beyhood and the things he did.

01:23:54.901 --> 01:23:57.061
I want Dündar to see his mistake, Mother.

01:23:59.981 --> 01:24:03.541
When I believe he has,
I will call him back to the oba.

01:24:04.781 --> 01:24:08.941
And when he is back,
I will give him an important mission...

01:24:09.501 --> 01:24:11.261
to show me that he is ready.

01:24:16.461 --> 01:24:17.901
You are right, son.

01:24:19.101 --> 01:24:20.901
May God watch over you.

01:24:47.101 --> 01:24:48.461
Come, Marya.

01:24:59.941 --> 01:25:01.341
My lord.

01:25:11.301 --> 01:25:13.621
You haven't slept for days.

01:25:15.061 --> 01:25:18.021
I fear your rage might hurt you.

01:25:21.621 --> 01:25:23.261
What if you rested a little?

01:25:24.021 --> 01:25:25.661
Ertuğrul is back, Marya.

01:25:28.701 --> 01:25:30.261
There will be no sleep for me.

01:25:31.981 --> 01:25:33.981
I will not rest until I kill Ertuğrul.

01:25:34.501 --> 01:25:38.501
That wretched man again.
Everything is his doing.

01:25:40.701 --> 01:25:42.621
My brother died because of him.

01:25:45.901 --> 01:25:47.461
A man that...

01:25:48.661 --> 01:25:52.301
goes dark at night and bright in day
is unpredictable.

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:55.541
I have to be cautious at all times, Marya.

01:25:56.261 --> 01:26:00.781
I will not rest until I kill Ertuğrul
with his own sword. Understand?

01:26:05.901 --> 01:26:09.781
Nobody can harm you
so long as you stay strong, my lord.

01:26:10.741 --> 01:26:12.021
Even Ertuğrul.

01:26:13.301 --> 01:26:15.461
Let our enemies fear you.

01:26:23.141 --> 01:26:24.621
What is it?

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:29.101
My lord,
we found two dead soldiers in the fort.

01:26:29.261 --> 01:26:30.461
What?

01:26:33.341 --> 01:26:34.461
Who killed them?

01:26:34.581 --> 01:26:36.581
We don't know, my lord. We found no trace.

01:26:36.661 --> 01:26:39.901
What do you mean, you don't know,
you idiot? What good are you?

01:26:39.981 --> 01:26:43.421
Search every corner of the fort!
Find who did this!

01:26:43.541 --> 01:26:46.941
Nobody sleeps until you do! Now get out!

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:48.541
Yes, my lord.

01:26:53.781 --> 01:26:55.101
My lord...

01:26:56.861 --> 01:26:58.301
Ertuğrul...

01:27:00.821 --> 01:27:03.341
What if he knows that I was the one
who set him up?

01:27:04.341 --> 01:27:06.101
What if he's playing me?

01:27:24.021 --> 01:27:25.661
Door.

01:27:45.221 --> 01:27:47.941
Now that Ertuğrul is back at his oba...

01:27:48.541 --> 01:27:51.381
our sultan will soon
call me back to Konya.

01:27:57.101 --> 01:27:59.301
We cannot leave these lands unattended.

01:28:00.741 --> 01:28:03.381
Tomorrow we go to Ares first thing.

01:28:04.541 --> 01:28:06.261
Yes, Eminence.

01:28:08.301 --> 01:28:12.701
Ertuğrul Bey has sent word to oba beys
about the feast tomorrow at Hanlı Market.

01:28:13.861 --> 01:28:16.581
It's clear he will get their backing
and seek revenge.

01:28:22.061 --> 01:28:25.101
We need to keep our end tight.

01:28:27.101 --> 01:28:31.821
Ertuğrul will figure out this set up
one way or the other.

01:28:32.741 --> 01:28:37.021
Then he will occupy the fort
with the order of our sultan.

01:28:43.061 --> 01:28:44.981
We cannot let him have this prize.

01:28:47.141 --> 01:28:51.901
He will figure everything out
once he learns it was Ares who set him up.

01:28:54.781 --> 01:28:56.181
Both Ekaterina...

01:28:57.341 --> 01:28:58.701
and you.

01:29:08.541 --> 01:29:09.981
It's crooked.

01:29:12.261 --> 01:29:14.221
I put so much effort into it...

01:29:14.741 --> 01:29:16.661
but it's still crooked.

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:22.101
A crooked arrow won't find its target.

01:29:26.021 --> 01:29:27.621
So, I shouldn't work on it.

01:29:30.981 --> 01:29:33.861
I worked hard
to pull Ertuğrul my way.

01:29:35.821 --> 01:29:38.381
But he always went in his own direction.

01:29:39.381 --> 01:29:42.061
He always stood in the way of my goal.

01:29:44.341 --> 01:29:48.141
Alas, from now on
I will do whatever it takes...

01:29:49.061 --> 01:29:52.301
collaborate with whoever I need to
so that he may not.

01:29:55.261 --> 01:29:57.781
Even if I leave this land...

01:29:58.901 --> 01:30:01.621
I will break his arms and wings.

01:30:21.941 --> 01:30:23.221
That's what happened, Halime.

01:30:25.301 --> 01:30:27.221
I finally made it back...

01:30:28.461 --> 01:30:32.701
by evading human traffickers
and the ambushes of the inglorious.

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:42.501
I came to you.

01:30:43.141 --> 01:30:46.061
Oh, the things
you've gone through, Ertuğrul!

01:30:47.181 --> 01:30:49.301
How did you put up with all that?

01:30:50.461 --> 01:30:55.181
I took refuge in God
and thought of my cause...

01:30:56.301 --> 01:30:59.661
my oba, my sons and you, Halime.

01:31:02.381 --> 01:31:03.821
It's God's will.

01:31:05.301 --> 01:31:09.541
I have life left to further our cause,
see our children grow...

01:31:10.661 --> 01:31:13.901
and grow old with you.

01:31:23.941 --> 01:31:26.341
May God give you a long life, Ertuğrul.

01:31:27.621 --> 01:31:29.821
May he not leave us without you.

01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:34.621
We saw what would happen in your absence.

01:31:41.101 --> 01:31:43.181
It is all over now.

01:31:43.661 --> 01:31:45.781
I am at the head of our oba...

01:31:46.741 --> 01:31:49.061
and with you and our children.

01:31:52.741 --> 01:31:56.101
I will hold a great feast tomorrow
at the Hanlı Market in honor of my return.

01:31:57.901 --> 01:32:00.221
All the beys in the vicinity will come.

01:32:00.941 --> 01:32:06.141
I want you and my mother to be there.
May it be a feast worthy of us.

01:32:07.581 --> 01:32:13.021
Let both our friends and our foes see that
we are one and in prosperity.

01:33:05.581 --> 01:33:09.421
-Turgut, take precautions.
-Alps! Surround him.

01:33:20.141 --> 01:33:21.701
Who the hell are you?

01:33:21.781 --> 01:33:24.701
Show your face.
Else I'll cut you with my sword.

01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:27.861
Speak, who are you?

01:33:32.501 --> 01:33:34.021
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum,</i> Ertuğrul Bey.

01:33:35.181 --> 01:33:37.061
<i>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam</i>, Atsız.

01:33:41.461 --> 01:33:43.221
Who is this Atsız, my bey?

01:33:44.421 --> 01:33:45.381
What is this?

01:33:45.741 --> 01:33:47.861
I have important news for you.

01:33:48.021 --> 01:33:50.461
I caught one of the men who ambushed us.

01:33:51.221 --> 01:33:52.981
He has things to tell you.

01:33:53.301 --> 01:33:54.661
Where is he?

01:33:56.061 --> 01:33:57.341
Come with me.

01:33:58.101 --> 01:33:59.861
Come on alps, after him.

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:06.941
Who is this, Artuk Bey?

01:34:07.381 --> 01:34:10.101
{\an8}It's clear he came in the nick of time,
Turgut Alp.

01:34:37.217 --> 01:34:40.697
You're talking about power, rulership,
gold, Emir Sadettin but...

01:34:41.897 --> 01:34:43.697
you couldn't handle even a margrave.

01:34:44.137 --> 01:34:47.177
Ertuğrul buried you in the ground
in front of us.

01:34:53.417 --> 01:34:54.457
Once...

01:34:55.657 --> 01:34:57.857
I was playing chess here.

01:34:58.777 --> 01:35:00.897
Commander Vasilius
was sitting right there.

01:35:01.897 --> 01:35:05.297
He used to say the exact same words
as you do.

01:35:06.217 --> 01:35:08.057
But he didn't listen to me.

01:35:08.137 --> 01:35:10.977
Then, Ertuğrul beheaded him.

01:35:11.297 --> 01:35:12.177
So, be careful.

01:35:12.657 --> 01:35:14.417
You might face the same destiny.

01:35:15.737 --> 01:35:18.937
Know, Emir Sadettin, that I only
tolerate you in the name of peace

01:35:19.017 --> 01:35:21.017
and trust between us at the bazaar.

01:35:28.217 --> 01:35:29.977
You're so noble.

01:35:31.657 --> 01:35:35.697
You're the one who ambushed Ertuğrul
and killed his alps. I know that.

01:35:36.217 --> 01:35:40.457
I could take your head
and your castle if I wanted to.

01:35:51.537 --> 01:35:53.657
You could never prove that, Emir Sadettin.

01:35:55.817 --> 01:35:58.177
That wound on your back.
How did you get it?

01:35:59.377 --> 01:36:00.777
Is it getting better?

01:36:00.937 --> 01:36:04.697
The wound dealt to you by Bamsi,
one of Ertuğrul's alps,

01:36:04.777 --> 01:36:06.857
when you set up the ambush.

01:36:08.057 --> 01:36:09.057
Emir Sadettin...

01:36:10.817 --> 01:36:12.937
If you think I’m not aware

01:36:13.537 --> 01:36:15.457
that you sent that letter to Ekaterina

01:36:15.537 --> 01:36:17.497
to get me to ambush Ertuğrul,
you’re wrong.

01:36:18.577 --> 01:36:20.337
The letter wasn't sealed
by you, obviously.

01:36:21.177 --> 01:36:22.537
But your rage was in there.

01:36:23.417 --> 01:36:26.857
Let me give you some advice.

01:36:27.257 --> 01:36:32.017
A man should not pursue dreams
that he cannot ever achieve.

01:36:32.657 --> 01:36:34.257
Otherwise, it will end in frustration.

01:36:35.377 --> 01:36:38.697
Only pursue God and the truth.

01:36:39.257 --> 01:36:40.937
Truth is gold.

01:36:42.057 --> 01:36:45.657
And gold is what fills our pockets,

01:36:46.457 --> 01:36:49.617
providing there is peace
between the two states.

01:36:50.697 --> 01:36:55.257
If you wish to get rich
by committing to our agreement,

01:36:55.377 --> 01:36:57.057
then you will heed my words.

01:36:58.897 --> 01:36:59.817
Yes.

01:37:00.577 --> 01:37:03.217
But you'll go back to Konya soon.
Then what?

01:37:03.577 --> 01:37:05.017
Bahadir Bey is here.

01:37:05.697 --> 01:37:08.977
Regard him as my lieutenant.
Our agreement will proceed as is.

01:37:09.577 --> 01:37:10.497
Bahadir Bey.

01:37:12.897 --> 01:37:15.497
I saw the wrath of him and his sons
at Hanlı Bazaar.

01:37:16.857 --> 01:37:18.697
We have wrath, don’t we Ares?

01:37:20.817 --> 01:37:22.417
What about Ertuğrul's wrath?

01:37:23.097 --> 01:37:24.017
What about that?

01:37:26.937 --> 01:37:28.977
Last night,
two men were killed in my castle.

01:37:30.737 --> 01:37:32.217
The killer is still at large.

01:37:33.017 --> 01:37:33.937
So?

01:37:35.577 --> 01:37:37.617
I doubt Ertuğrul knows the truth.

01:37:39.177 --> 01:37:41.417
But he might be involved
in last night's incident.

01:37:42.457 --> 01:37:43.337
What if...

01:37:44.697 --> 01:37:46.657
he knows the truth and is playing with us?

01:37:51.977 --> 01:37:53.857
Rest assured, Tekfur Ares.

01:37:55.297 --> 01:37:57.497
If Ertuğrul knew
that you were the ambusher,

01:37:58.337 --> 01:38:00.777
he would have already taken your head
at Hanlı Bazaar.

01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:03.457
He'll gather his beys today.

01:38:03.857 --> 01:38:06.057
He'll go after the brigands

01:38:06.577 --> 01:38:09.577
that attacked merchants,
as well as the man that ambushed him.

01:38:09.857 --> 01:38:14.137
Before he finds out it was you,
we'll take him down, god willing.

01:38:17.137 --> 01:38:20.457
Maybe it is indeed wise
for you go back to Konya, Emir Sadettin.

01:38:21.457 --> 01:38:23.617
While we prepare for Ertuğrul's end,

01:38:24.017 --> 01:38:26.137
you can distract the Sultan
and keep his eyes diverted.

01:38:27.097 --> 01:38:29.017
Hopefully, he'll never open them again.

01:38:31.777 --> 01:38:36.337
As long there is peace, Emir Sadettin,
we have the same interests.

01:38:40.857 --> 01:38:44.297
Then appreciate the peace, Tekfur Ares.

01:38:45.537 --> 01:38:49.577
Let Ertuğrul die,
so we can profit forever.

01:39:02.377 --> 01:39:03.297
I know everything.

01:39:03.937 --> 01:39:07.617
Ares ambushed me, killed my alps.

01:39:08.057 --> 01:39:10.817
Knowing that I'm alive,
he sent you after me.

01:39:11.177 --> 01:39:14.457
You ran to him
right after you escaped from us.

01:39:14.977 --> 01:39:15.897
I know everything.

01:39:17.737 --> 01:39:20.097
Then why don't you kill me?

01:39:21.017 --> 01:39:23.537
You'll tell me everything you know.

01:39:25.537 --> 01:39:27.137
I know nothing.

01:39:36.897 --> 01:39:37.897
Talk...

01:39:38.977 --> 01:39:41.217
or face pain.

01:39:57.817 --> 01:40:00.337
Wait, I'll tell you everything!

01:40:05.097 --> 01:40:09.817
Were you there when Ares
ambushed my alps and I?

01:40:12.497 --> 01:40:14.337
How did he know where I was?

01:40:15.257 --> 01:40:16.137
That night...

01:40:17.137 --> 01:40:19.097
We got the command that night.

01:40:19.817 --> 01:40:22.497
We were told to dress like brigands.

01:40:23.297 --> 01:40:27.057
Ares was dressed like one, too.

01:40:27.577 --> 01:40:31.337
He said we were going to kill you.

01:40:36.097 --> 01:40:37.017
Bey...

01:40:38.097 --> 01:40:43.177
Ares probably got the command
right after Sultan decided on voyage.

01:40:48.017 --> 01:40:48.897
Who told Ares...

01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:52.257
we were going off on a voyage?

01:40:53.617 --> 01:40:56.297
I don't know, I swear.

01:41:01.017 --> 01:41:04.057
Ekaterina was with him.

01:41:06.457 --> 01:41:10.697
They were pretty sure you were dead.

01:41:11.417 --> 01:41:14.017
They were laughing with joy.

01:41:15.417 --> 01:41:16.657
Ekaterina...

01:41:18.137 --> 01:41:19.017
Bey...

01:41:19.897 --> 01:41:22.577
She took an oath to take revenge on Ural.

01:41:23.737 --> 01:41:25.497
So, she's in on it, too.

01:41:26.257 --> 01:41:27.737
Who told her?

01:41:30.177 --> 01:41:31.737
Anyone close to the Sultan

01:41:32.617 --> 01:41:35.537
who knew about the voyage

01:41:36.097 --> 01:41:37.577
has to be a suspect.

01:41:38.737 --> 01:41:40.817
Emir Sadettin was there too, bey.

01:41:42.337 --> 01:41:44.977
I see him as a suspect too, Artuk Bey.

01:41:58.857 --> 01:42:00.857
Ertuğrul's return has
messed everything up.

01:42:01.737 --> 01:42:04.617
In addition to that, our strongest ally
is returning to Konya.

01:42:05.297 --> 01:42:06.857
This will make things difficult.

01:42:07.257 --> 01:42:08.737
But we'll get through it.

01:42:09.977 --> 01:42:11.897
What is our next move against Ertuğrul?

01:42:12.497 --> 01:42:15.577
Ertuğrul acted like he didn't know
I was the one who ambushed him.

01:42:16.537 --> 01:42:19.177
I still doubt whether he really knows.

01:42:19.257 --> 01:42:23.137
But the soldiers killed in the castle
last night have risen my suspicions.

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:26.217
Ertuğrul could be behind it.

01:42:26.297 --> 01:42:29.617
So, you think Ertuğrul
might be playing with us, Sir?

01:42:29.737 --> 01:42:31.057
Anything is possible.

01:42:31.497 --> 01:42:34.657
Ertuğrul is not just a warrior.
He is a quick-witted Turk.

01:42:35.177 --> 01:42:38.657
Remember, even Emir Sadettin
couldn't bring him down.

01:42:39.057 --> 01:42:42.177
But to defeat the Turks,
we must defeat Ertuğrul.

01:42:43.537 --> 01:42:45.897
And until then,
we must be quick-witted too.

01:42:47.937 --> 01:42:51.417
Ertuğrul will be the object of focus
until we regather our strength.

01:42:52.777 --> 01:42:54.737
We'll accept the olive branch he extended,

01:42:55.017 --> 01:42:58.337
but on the sly, we'll corner him.

01:42:59.257 --> 01:43:02.577
If he's playing games with us,
we'll play one with him, too.

01:43:05.377 --> 01:43:06.497
When you escaped,

01:43:07.377 --> 01:43:09.657
what did you talk about with Ares
in the castle?

01:43:13.617 --> 01:43:18.377
He was angry with you
for breaking the bazaar agreement.

01:43:20.257 --> 01:43:23.897
He swore to kill all trade in the bazaar.

01:43:26.017 --> 01:43:26.977
Nicaea...

01:43:27.217 --> 01:43:29.257
There is this merchant from Nicaea.

01:43:31.137 --> 01:43:32.097
Niko...

01:43:32.697 --> 01:43:36.777
He sent me to bring
that merchant alive to castle.

01:43:38.377 --> 01:43:40.057
When is this merchant coming?

01:43:40.177 --> 01:43:43.537
In a few days.

01:43:44.817 --> 01:43:45.697
Bey.

01:43:48.817 --> 01:43:52.097
I think that merchant is the same one
whom Emir Sadettin included

01:43:52.297 --> 01:43:55.897
in the agreement
to facilitate trade with the Franks.

01:44:00.897 --> 01:44:02.497
Emir Sadettin again?

01:44:07.017 --> 01:44:09.377
He definitely made a deal with Ares...

01:44:10.817 --> 01:44:13.497
before Bahadir attempted
to take over the bazaar.

01:44:13.577 --> 01:44:15.097
He brought Bahadir here

01:44:15.217 --> 01:44:17.977
and allowed him to set eyes
on Aliyar Bey's tent.

01:44:18.097 --> 01:44:22.137
Emir Sadettin seems to appear
under every stone.

01:44:22.457 --> 01:44:25.657
May those stones crush his head, Bey.

01:44:28.297 --> 01:44:30.777
I told you everything I know.

01:44:31.457 --> 01:44:33.337
Let me live.

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:37.857
Bamsi...

01:44:39.217 --> 01:44:40.337
Do what is necessary.

01:44:50.057 --> 01:44:52.857
Will you let the Sultan know
what we've learned, Bey?

01:44:56.017 --> 01:44:57.497
I will, Artuk Bey.

01:44:58.217 --> 01:45:01.897
Our Sultan will know
what a traitor Emir Sadettin is.

01:45:03.457 --> 01:45:05.657
Atsız, get to the castle now.

01:45:06.217 --> 01:45:07.657
Keep me posted.

01:45:53.977 --> 01:45:56.337
It's a good consistency.

01:45:57.057 --> 01:45:58.777
Boil it a little while, then move on.

01:45:58.857 --> 01:46:00.337
Sure, Mother Hayme.

01:46:13.857 --> 01:46:14.737
Ladies!

01:46:16.737 --> 01:46:19.777
Save the best parts of the meat
for the people.

01:46:22.257 --> 01:46:23.737
Feed the poor.

01:46:24.177 --> 01:46:26.457
Give alms.

01:46:27.537 --> 01:46:33.057
With their prayers,
may all evil, seen and unseen,

01:46:33.537 --> 01:46:34.577
go away.

01:46:34.697 --> 01:46:35.977
God willing!

01:46:40.537 --> 01:46:41.777
May things be easy.

01:46:42.097 --> 01:46:43.577
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

01:47:07.817 --> 01:47:08.857
What is this, Göktuğ?

01:47:09.537 --> 01:47:11.817
It's from our Sultan, Your Majesty.

01:47:12.017 --> 01:47:13.017
Our Sultan?

01:47:14.017 --> 01:47:14.897
What for?

01:47:16.417 --> 01:47:19.377
A robe and gifts for Ertuğrul Bey.

01:47:20.497 --> 01:47:23.177
The Sultan orders you to return to Konya,

01:47:24.137 --> 01:47:26.297
since Ertuğrul Bey is back at the tent.

01:47:29.937 --> 01:47:31.217
And before returning...

01:47:33.297 --> 01:47:34.777
Before returning, what?

01:47:36.297 --> 01:47:38.857
Say what you were going to say, damn it!

01:47:39.257 --> 01:47:41.177
Before returning, what?

01:47:42.377 --> 01:47:46.417
He orders you to deliver
the margrave insignias to Ertuğrul Bey.

01:47:48.377 --> 01:47:50.257
You, yourself,
will announce it to the beys

01:47:51.057 --> 01:47:53.977
and dress him in his robes.

01:47:57.137 --> 01:47:58.617
God damn it!

01:47:58.897 --> 01:48:01.777
Ertuğrul and his margraveship...

01:48:02.377 --> 01:48:04.097
God, forgive me!

01:48:04.937 --> 01:48:06.697
I just can't get rid of him!

01:48:07.537 --> 01:48:11.977
And now, I must dress him up
in his robes with my own hands.

01:48:12.817 --> 01:48:15.257
"Mighty Emir Sadettin Köpek

01:48:15.657 --> 01:48:17.657
wasn't even a challenge for Ertuğrul,"
they all said.

01:48:18.977 --> 01:48:21.177
What is your order, Your Majesty?

01:48:26.457 --> 01:48:27.457
What can we do?

01:48:29.817 --> 01:48:32.617
We can't oppose the Sultan's orders.

01:48:35.937 --> 01:48:38.217
Tell them to prepare the beylic insignias.

01:48:39.697 --> 01:48:43.177
Prepare for the voyage to Konya
after the council.

01:48:48.057 --> 01:48:49.897
Tomorrow is another day.

01:48:51.377 --> 01:48:54.057
I am Emir Sadettin.

01:48:54.977 --> 01:48:58.457
God willing,
I'll finish what I've started.

01:49:09.657 --> 01:49:12.897
All he's brought is trouble since he came.

01:49:13.617 --> 01:49:15.337
He is so blinded by anger.

01:49:15.537 --> 01:49:17.937
How dare he draw his sword
against Ertuğrul Bey?

01:49:18.497 --> 01:49:21.777
Neither he nor Emir Sadettin
have brought us peace.

01:49:23.257 --> 01:49:25.137
Girl, don't you worry.

01:49:25.537 --> 01:49:28.817
Ertuğrul always makes
the best possible decisions.

01:49:28.977 --> 01:49:31.897
Mother Hayme, this man takes no orders.

01:49:34.017 --> 01:49:36.497
Then he shares his destiny with Ural.

01:49:40.297 --> 01:49:42.297
Thank God we've lived to see these days.

01:49:42.697 --> 01:49:44.897
We had long yearned
for the meeting of the council.

01:49:45.257 --> 01:49:46.817
That's not all.

01:49:47.217 --> 01:49:48.537
Ertuğrul is back.

01:49:49.057 --> 01:49:51.097
And we must think about
you and Turgut's engagement.

01:49:59.657 --> 01:50:00.577
Ertuğrul...

01:50:00.977 --> 01:50:02.777
Now that he's postponed
the council meeting,

01:50:03.377 --> 01:50:06.697
many of the Cavdar beys
don't recognize my reign.

01:50:07.497 --> 01:50:08.697
Ertuğrul, you...

01:50:09.537 --> 01:50:11.617
I have no patience left for him.

01:50:12.097 --> 01:50:13.057
My sword...

01:50:13.497 --> 01:50:17.857
I barely can keep it in its sheath,
Your Majesty!

01:50:18.577 --> 01:50:20.857
Tame your wrath, Bahadir Bey.

01:50:24.097 --> 01:50:26.697
If you drew your sword against him
at the bazaar

01:50:26.977 --> 01:50:28.977
accompanied by your sons and alps,

01:50:29.057 --> 01:50:32.137
he would obviously look for revenge.

01:50:32.977 --> 01:50:35.497
Be patient until the opportunity arises.

01:50:37.017 --> 01:50:38.417
Regardless...

01:50:40.137 --> 01:50:42.537
you must kiss his hand
and recognize his reign.

01:50:47.217 --> 01:50:48.417
Never!

01:50:49.657 --> 01:50:51.897
I will never!

01:50:52.257 --> 01:50:55.817
Then say goodbye to your Cavdar bey
and your margrave.

01:51:04.577 --> 01:51:08.777
Those Oguz beys obey him
without question.

01:51:09.537 --> 01:51:10.697
Emir, Your Majesty.

01:51:11.257 --> 01:51:12.137
You...

01:51:12.497 --> 01:51:14.217
You must allow me.

01:51:14.697 --> 01:51:17.657
Allow me to behead that Ertuğrul
in the middle of the council meeting

01:51:17.817 --> 01:51:19.657
and put it on a spike
before the Oguz beys!

01:51:19.777 --> 01:51:22.057
You'll do what I say.

01:51:22.737 --> 01:51:23.817
Be patient.

01:51:27.017 --> 01:51:29.057
The Sultan has called me
to return to Konya.

01:51:29.137 --> 01:51:30.617
But I'll be back.

01:51:30.857 --> 01:51:33.537
When the time comes,
slice up his whole family

01:51:33.617 --> 01:51:35.537
along with Ertuğrul, if you wish.

01:51:36.297 --> 01:51:42.137
The verdict he gives on you
and your tent, it must be in our favor

01:51:43.657 --> 01:51:44.777
Bahadir Bey...

01:51:45.537 --> 01:51:47.057
remember my word!

01:51:48.617 --> 01:51:52.737
If you can't reunite the Cavdars
and be their bey...

01:51:54.297 --> 01:51:56.217
you are nothing to me, either.

01:54:02.577 --> 01:54:04.217
Welcome bey!

01:54:22.737 --> 01:54:24.177
Welcome, bey!

01:54:39.257 --> 01:54:40.337
Good to see you, beys.

01:54:41.217 --> 01:54:42.097
Thank you.

01:54:44.857 --> 01:54:48.817
You may know that my alps and I
were ambushed,

01:54:49.457 --> 01:54:52.537
and the bastards came at us
from everywhere.

01:54:54.537 --> 01:54:57.217
In my absence,

01:54:58.217 --> 01:55:00.377
they unsettled the bazaar.

01:55:01.817 --> 01:55:04.137
They longed to possess...

01:55:05.337 --> 01:55:07.297
our food, our trade, our peace.

01:55:08.297 --> 01:55:11.457
Like hyenas searching for a carcass,

01:55:12.057 --> 01:55:13.617
they attacked from every direction.

01:55:13.697 --> 01:55:16.017
We'll knock the wind out of their sails!

01:55:16.097 --> 01:55:20.097
Now you're back,
we'll cut their heads off.

01:55:20.257 --> 01:55:21.737
We will do!

01:55:26.097 --> 01:55:28.097
-Thank you.
-We will do, Bey!

01:55:40.097 --> 01:55:41.577
It's obvious that...

01:55:42.857 --> 01:55:48.177
Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad,
like all the beys here...

01:55:49.377 --> 01:55:54.657
is extremely happy
that Ertuğrul Bey is alive.

01:55:56.457 --> 01:55:57.537
Therefore...

01:55:59.297 --> 01:56:02.537
our Sultan has given the order...

01:56:03.817 --> 01:56:07.617
for me to confer
the margrave insignias.

01:58:06.577 --> 01:58:08.577
Good luck, Bey!

01:58:13.977 --> 01:58:15.377
Congratulations, bey!

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:19.257
May God be with you!

01:58:19.777 --> 01:58:20.977
Thank you, beys.

01:58:21.617 --> 01:58:22.497
Thank you.

01:58:26.057 --> 01:58:27.057
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:58:31.177 --> 01:58:32.937
May this bring good fortune.

01:58:43.497 --> 01:58:44.617
To achieve good fortune...

01:58:45.937 --> 01:58:50.737
first, we need to clear out
the agents of misfortune among us.

01:59:19.537 --> 01:59:20.977
Let Sancar Bey in.

01:59:22.897 --> 01:59:25.297
I'll give my verdict before my beys.

01:59:50.857 --> 01:59:53.617
The great warrior, Lukas,
died for our cause.

01:59:55.417 --> 01:59:59.497
To fill his place, I'll choose one of you
to be commander of the castle.

02:00:10.857 --> 02:00:12.817
Commander Kostas...

02:00:20.097 --> 02:00:22.777
From now on,
you will have the command of the castle.

02:00:23.097 --> 02:00:25.057
I'm sure you'll fulfill this duty capably.

02:00:25.857 --> 02:00:26.737
I trust you.

02:00:26.817 --> 02:00:28.977
I won't betray your trust, sir.

02:00:29.857 --> 02:00:32.937
I'll fight until my last breath.

02:00:34.697 --> 02:00:37.377
While we're keeping peace with Ertuğrul,

02:00:37.857 --> 02:00:40.977
we'll make te Turk tents run with blood.

02:00:41.617 --> 02:00:42.617
Sir...

02:00:43.217 --> 02:00:46.257
We paid the brigands,
raided the merchant caravans.

02:00:47.057 --> 02:00:51.697
But if we attack the Turk tents,
there will be no more chance for peace.

02:00:52.097 --> 02:00:53.297
We won't attack the tents.

02:00:54.337 --> 02:00:55.737
Someone else will.

02:00:57.257 --> 02:00:58.137
Who, sir?

02:00:59.297 --> 02:01:02.177
The legendary knight, Titan.

02:01:11.657 --> 02:01:14.257
I sent word already. He'll be here soon.

02:01:14.857 --> 02:01:15.737
Sir...

02:01:17.097 --> 02:01:18.777
Titan is a dangerous man.

02:01:19.377 --> 02:01:21.617
He might cause us great trouble.

02:01:24.617 --> 02:01:26.897
We need someone like him, Kostas.

02:01:27.617 --> 02:01:29.777
Someone who renders the Turks helpless.

02:01:30.737 --> 02:01:32.457
Ertuğrul's hands will be tied.

02:01:33.217 --> 02:01:34.737
And I'll strike...

02:01:35.697 --> 02:01:37.057
the final blow.

02:02:35.737 --> 02:02:37.737
With your two alps,

02:02:38.697 --> 02:02:39.897
you pulled a weapon on me.

02:02:41.497 --> 02:02:42.817
Have anything to say?

02:02:43.577 --> 02:02:44.657
Ertuğrul Bey...

02:02:45.817 --> 02:02:49.617
for the sake our peace and unity,
for which you called this meeting,

02:02:50.657 --> 02:02:53.457
just blame it on his youth.

02:02:54.817 --> 02:02:58.377
Picking at this scab
will do no good for anyone.

02:03:00.737 --> 02:03:03.457
Sancar Bey crossed the line.

02:03:04.457 --> 02:03:07.377
And he'll pay the price, Emir Sadettin.

02:03:10.897 --> 02:03:11.777
Now...

02:03:12.577 --> 02:03:15.297
I want to hear what he has to say.

02:03:15.897 --> 02:03:18.377
You impinged on my father's rights,
Ertuğrul Bey.

02:03:19.177 --> 02:03:22.337
It was my duty to retaliate,
according to our laws and traditions.

02:03:23.057 --> 02:03:26.057
I did what it takes as Cavdar Bey.

02:03:31.057 --> 02:03:36.257
Your greed and your arrogance
costed two lives.

02:03:37.977 --> 02:03:42.217
I thought you would be
ashamed of your actions...

02:03:43.137 --> 02:03:47.457
but you're still insubordinate.
You cross the line.

02:03:50.897 --> 02:03:52.137
Mighty Turk beys,

02:03:53.057 --> 02:03:56.297
I do not wish to keep
this Cavdar Bey among us.

02:03:56.777 --> 02:03:59.097
He would poison us.

02:04:03.217 --> 02:04:05.937
Today, the weapon has drawn against me.

02:04:06.697 --> 02:04:08.777
Tomorrow, it will be drawn against you.

02:04:09.257 --> 02:04:11.617
He speaks the truth.

02:04:15.457 --> 02:04:18.657
He who stands against the margrave
must face the consequences.

02:04:18.777 --> 02:04:20.937
Consequences!

02:04:23.817 --> 02:04:28.937
By my will, you will be exiled
from these lands, Sancar Bey.

02:04:33.017 --> 02:04:37.497
Take your horse and your weapon
and leave these lands, now.

02:04:38.617 --> 02:04:44.217
If I see you on these lands again...

02:04:45.577 --> 02:04:48.577
I won't hesitate to chop off your head.

02:04:57.297 --> 02:04:58.217
Alps!

02:05:22.057 --> 02:05:23.217
Ertuğrul Bey...

02:05:24.777 --> 02:05:27.137
I won't let you exile my son.

02:05:27.897 --> 02:05:29.857
If you're looking
for agents of misfortune,

02:05:30.257 --> 02:05:35.897
look to your brother Dündar and the beys
who agreed to sell me the bazaar.

02:05:39.777 --> 02:05:41.217
Neither my brother Dündar...

02:05:42.537 --> 02:05:45.297
nor the beys in my tent

02:05:45.977 --> 02:05:49.177
are tolerated when they make mistakes,
Bahadir Bey.

02:05:49.537 --> 02:05:50.537
Not at all.

02:05:53.977 --> 02:05:56.777
First, you obey me.

02:05:58.057 --> 02:06:03.217
If you do, we fight together
to make these lands our own.

02:06:04.457 --> 02:06:10.377
Otherwise, I exile you and your tent,
just like I did to Sancar Bey.

02:06:15.497 --> 02:06:21.537
You interfered in our council
to banish from my own ancient tent.

02:06:22.537 --> 02:06:24.137
Is this what you call justice?

02:06:24.577 --> 02:06:28.177
Is this how you govern as margrave?

02:06:34.377 --> 02:06:38.177
And you, you cheer this tyranny

02:06:38.697 --> 02:06:40.617
when you should stand against it!

02:06:42.337 --> 02:06:44.257
Shame on your bey!

02:06:46.817 --> 02:06:48.297
Bahadir Bey!

02:06:51.377 --> 02:06:52.257
Enough!

02:06:54.257 --> 02:06:55.297
Know your place!

02:06:56.617 --> 02:07:03.577
If you don't, you'll find your fate
on the tip of Ertuğrul Bey's sword.

02:07:05.457 --> 02:07:07.657
Don't push us.

02:07:09.417 --> 02:07:12.857
Ertuğrul Bey is the margrave
of these lands.

02:07:13.897 --> 02:07:17.257
In politics, in peace, in war,

02:07:17.417 --> 02:07:20.537
in trade and in law,
his word is law.

02:07:21.777 --> 02:07:25.497
His word is the word of the state.
Don't you know that?

02:07:27.777 --> 02:07:32.057
-His Majesty speaks the truth.
-Yes, he speaks the truth.

02:07:35.417 --> 02:07:36.337
Now...

02:07:37.537 --> 02:07:43.217
either obey Ertuğrul Bey
along with the other beys, here...

02:07:45.697 --> 02:07:49.217
or take your tent with you
and leave these lands.

02:08:32.137 --> 02:08:33.017
Thanks.

02:08:35.657 --> 02:08:36.537
Thanks.

02:08:48.657 --> 02:08:49.537
Thanks.

02:08:54.737 --> 02:08:55.657
Thanks.

02:10:19.777 --> 02:10:20.737
Beys!

02:10:21.937 --> 02:10:25.817
Our duty is to bring justice to the world

02:10:26.937 --> 02:10:30.217
so that we may please God.

02:10:31.737 --> 02:10:33.257
We won't be tyrannical ourselves,

02:10:33.977 --> 02:10:35.937
nor will we surrender to tyranny.

02:10:39.417 --> 02:10:43.177
In this cause, we will dominate

02:10:43.817 --> 02:10:46.137
and force the enemy to kneel.

02:10:54.417 --> 02:10:58.337
God willing, the holy flag of the justice

02:10:59.057 --> 02:11:03.017
will be raised around the world.

02:11:03.537 --> 02:11:06.337
God willing, Ertuğrul Bey!

02:11:08.497 --> 02:11:09.417
God willing.

02:11:14.177 --> 02:11:15.977
God willing, bey!
