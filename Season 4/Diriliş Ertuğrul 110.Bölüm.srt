1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Episode 110 will start after 12:05 min.

2
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:22,996
Günalp Bey!

3
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:29,196
Sooner or later, you'll pay
for what you're doing.

4
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:34,396
You're signing your own death sentence
by breaking the hearts of innocents,

5
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:37,116
and hanging them
in the castle they conquered.

6
00:13:57,956 --> 00:14:00,836
We're here today...

7
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:06,556
to punish the traitors
responsible for taking our sultan's life.

8
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:11,476
Their punishment won't stop here.

9
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:16,836
They will turn in their graves with
the guilt of killing our sultan...

10
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:23,156
while he was on his way to war.

11
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:33,756
As for the tribes they leave behind,

12
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:36,436
if they rebel against our state...

13
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:41,836
I won't hesitate to mete out
the same punishment.

14
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:46,356
You'll pay for this,

15
00:14:47,316 --> 00:14:51,116
you and the one who pulls your strings,
Sadettin.

16
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:54,636
With God's help.

17
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:05,396
Günalp Bey, if one of us dies, a thousand
of us will rise up in his stead.

18
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:09,476
You'll never succeed in what you're doing.

19
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:19,476
I won't allow anyone
to rebel against our state.

20
00:15:23,036 --> 00:15:24,516
Go to hell.

21
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:35,636
-Sungur Bey!
-Sungur Bey!

22
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:49,436
Who did that?

23
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:57,516
Suleyman Shah's son, Ertuğrul.

24
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:02,196
-Our Ertuğrul Bey!
-Ertuğrul Bey!

25
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,516
My Bey.

26
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:05,396
My Bey.

27
00:16:06,996 --> 00:16:08,076
Ertuğrul.

28
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:22,956
Despite the palace being
taken over by snakes and rats,

29
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:26,196
my innocence was proven to all.

30
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,196
Sultan Giyaseddin Keyhusrev's
verdict is that

31
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:37,036
my brothers and I are innocent.

32
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:46,636
Now...

33
00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:51,476
remove the rope you've put around
the necks of my brave men, Günalp Bey.

34
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:04,196
I've got a score to settle with you
and the cowards who ordered

35
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:05,796
the deaths of my brave men.

36
00:17:41,316 --> 00:17:43,956
It was Sultan Alaeddin's orders

37
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:46,796
that Günalp Bey should be
sent to Karacahisar

38
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:50,116
to ensure the duties of his margrave
were carried out properly.

39
00:17:50,596 --> 00:17:52,676
Günalp Bey is a valued servant

40
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:57,076
who fought many battles
by your late father's side.

41
00:17:57,636 --> 00:18:01,356
When we leave for Amid,
you can rely upon him

42
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:03,916
to keep our western borders secure.

43
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:09,796
Ertuğrul Bey is innocent,
you know that as well as I.

44
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:13,836
My father died of old age.

45
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,516
That is what everyone will be told.

46
00:18:25,196 --> 00:18:26,156
Fine.

47
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:30,396
Ertuğrul Bey will continue to
be the margrave of our western borders,

48
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,756
in line with my father's final order.

49
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:35,636
My Sultan!

50
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:40,916
I'm glad to hear Ertuğrul has been
judged innocent, of course I am.

51
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:43,916
But we obviously run the risk

52
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:50,156
of him swimming against the current
and causing problems while you are away.

53
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:54,516
Sehzade Kilicarslan is still alive.

54
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:59,756
Given those circumstances, we can't
be sure what Ertuğrul Bey might do.

55
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:05,156
-You should be cautious, my Sultan.
-Enough!

56
00:19:08,716 --> 00:19:12,996
None of you have the authority
to have my father's orders withdrawn.

57
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:18,836
I trust Ertuğrul completely.

58
00:19:20,956 --> 00:19:22,196
He keeps his position.

59
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:33,996
Günalp Bey will swear loyalty
to Ertuğrul Bey and serve him.

60
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,316
Those are my orders.

61
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:39,876
Understood?

62
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:49,276
As for my brother, Kilicarslan.

63
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:55,876
He and his mother will be allowed
to live in peace in Ankara Castle.

64
00:19:59,196 --> 00:20:00,996
I don't want anything to happen to them.

65
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:05,956
If it does,
you'll be the first to pay for it.

66
00:20:58,276 --> 00:21:00,556
They'll kill us just like
they killed my father, Mother.

67
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:03,876
You are Alaeddin Keykubat's son,
Kilicarslan.

68
00:21:04,836 --> 00:21:08,596
You will not allow anyone to trample
over your father's will or our pride.

69
00:21:11,676 --> 00:21:13,236
We must escape first, Mother.

70
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:16,036
There are still soldiers
loyal to their state

71
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:19,836
who are ready to lay down their
lives for you and for your father's will.

72
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:21,796
When the time comes,

73
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:26,436
they'll fight that demon Altun Aba
and his soldiers while you escape.

74
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:30,716
-They'll have a horse ready for you.
-What about you?

75
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:34,196
My son, my Kilicarslan.

76
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:37,316
It was your father's wish

77
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:41,196
that you took the throne to ensure
the Turk tribes and Islam survive.

78
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:47,076
Never forget that the future
of the state depends on you.

79
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:50,556
Run and fight for your rights.

80
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:55,276
Your father's soul
cannot rest until you do.

81
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,636
You went too far, Günalp Bey.

82
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:28,316
You know you'll have to pay for it.

83
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:31,716
I was ordered to kill you

84
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:35,596
and the other Beys
in your council, Ertuğrul Bey.

85
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:38,156
Insidiously...

86
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:41,156
you stole into the castle I conquered.

87
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:46,076
Worse still, you took my position here.

88
00:22:47,996 --> 00:22:51,796
Why did you dare do that, Günalp Bey?
Answer me.

89
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:57,956
I was doing as I should,
I was carrying out my duty.

90
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,716
And what of Artuk Bey, Turgut Bey,

91
00:23:01,356 --> 00:23:05,036
Bamsı Alp, and my brother Sungurtekin?

92
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:08,556
Why did you try to have them hanged?

93
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:12,236
Your brother Sungurtekin
broke into the castle

94
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:16,036
and attempted to free
the convicted prisoners.

95
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:23,556
And were my Beys convicted of a crime?

96
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:31,556
What else could Sungurtekin Bey have done
to prevent you killing innocent people?

97
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:34,796
How dare you attempt,

98
00:23:35,596 --> 00:23:39,236
on the word of the Emir,
to kill heroic men serving their state.

99
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:44,476
Is Emir Sadettin our sultan?

100
00:23:45,036 --> 00:23:48,476
Who is he to order the deaths
of men loyal to their state?

101
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:52,476
Is Altun Aba the judge?

102
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:57,956
He acts like the spokesman of sharia law,
with you as his executioner.

103
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:04,596
Don't you understand that I was only
carrying out my orders, Ertuğrul Bey?

104
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:10,396
You're either a traitor who rented
his weapon to Emir Sadettin

105
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:15,836
or you're a pathetic person
who's blinded by loyalty to his state.

106
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:19,436
Tell me...

107
00:24:21,596 --> 00:24:23,116
which is it, Günalp Bey?

108
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,516
Enough, Ertuğrul Bey. Know your limits.

109
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:34,916
You have been forgiven by our sultan

110
00:24:35,596 --> 00:24:37,796
on the basis of İbn-i Arabi's guarantee.

111
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:41,956
For my part, this matter is at an end.

112
00:24:57,036 --> 00:25:00,596
The ones who accused me
of taking our sultan's life

113
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:03,356
know now that I'm innocent.

114
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:04,516
Good.

115
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:11,076
The loyalty my Beys and I have
for our state is obvious,

116
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,676
as is our innocence.

117
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:16,796
So...

118
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,836
your presence here
is no longer required, Günalp Bey.

119
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:29,276
Now... leave my castle immediately,
and take your soldiers with you.

120
00:26:10,396 --> 00:26:11,836
It's not in your power

121
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,276
to dismiss me and my soldiers

122
00:26:14,396 --> 00:26:16,516
from our roles
at Karacahisar Castle, Ertuğrul Bey.

123
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:21,276
Are you asking me to hand
the castle I conquered over to you?

124
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:23,036
Not at all.

125
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:28,996
I neither have the right
nor would I dare to ask that.

126
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:34,836
Emir Sadettin and Atabey Altun Aba's order

127
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:37,516
became obsolete the moment
you were proven innocent.

128
00:26:38,836 --> 00:26:40,116
However...

129
00:26:40,836 --> 00:26:44,236
the final orders of our late
Sultan Alaeddin must be followed...

130
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:49,356
by you and I both.

131
00:26:50,996 --> 00:26:52,676
What are you saying, Günalp Bey?

132
00:27:07,796 --> 00:27:12,956
Our late Sultan Alaeddin sent
these orders to me...

133
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:16,036
when I was at Ahlat Castle.

134
00:27:21,276 --> 00:27:26,676
He ordered me and my
soldiers to Karacahisar Castle

135
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:28,956
to serve under your command.

136
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:34,876
If you are as loyal to our late sultan
as you say you are...

137
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,876
you have no choice but to obey that order.

138
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:54,156
I'll gladly follow... our sultan's order.

139
00:27:55,596 --> 00:27:58,356
I'll agree to you remaining here,
Günalp Bey.

140
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:00,236
However...

141
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:07,036
if I see any sign of disloyalty
or if you fail to obey my orders,

142
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:10,356
know that I will destroy you.

143
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:29,156
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

144
00:28:32,756 --> 00:28:34,556
<i>Semi Allahu limen hamideh.</i>

145
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:37,636
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

146
00:28:43,676 --> 00:28:45,476
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

147
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:48,356
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

148
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:07,956
<i>Esselamu aleykum ve rahmetullah.</i>

149
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,436
<i>Esselamu aleykum ve rahmetullah.</i>

150
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,116
Sir...

151
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:56,516
what a beautiful state of being this is.

152
00:29:59,476 --> 00:30:00,676
I've never...

153
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:08,396
felt this level of true peace and ease...

154
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,756
in my life before.

155
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:17,196
When I'm praying...

156
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:19,916
it feels like...

157
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:22,716
my soul is cleansed.

158
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:27,956
I couldn't stop the tears
falling from my eyes.

159
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:35,716
The clear water that flows
from the springs...

160
00:30:37,596 --> 00:30:39,796
is the representation of cleanliness.

161
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:45,316
It cleans people of dirt, cleans
the flowers and meadows of dust.

162
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:51,276
The tears which fall from our eyes
waters the garden in our hearts.

163
00:30:52,996 --> 00:30:55,596
It nurtures the flowers in our hearts.

164
00:30:58,676 --> 00:31:02,356
You should be happy
to shed tears for God.

165
00:31:05,036 --> 00:31:08,676
Your tears show the peace
you have achieved in your soul.

166
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,636
Sir...

167
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:16,636
you opened a door for me.

168
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:20,956
I'm so grateful for that.

169
00:31:22,956 --> 00:31:23,876
But...

170
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,156
I'm curious about
the doors that will follow.

171
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:34,996
God is the one who opens doors, son.

172
00:31:36,156 --> 00:31:38,236
We are only the cause.

173
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:41,636
If you hadn't asked for our help...

174
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:44,876
we couldn't have given it to you.

175
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:48,556
Holy God orders in the Qur'an...

176
00:31:49,196 --> 00:31:55,156
"If a community won't change
their morals, God won't change them."

177
00:31:56,596 --> 00:31:59,196
If God wishes evil on a community...

178
00:32:01,156 --> 00:32:03,796
there's no way to escape it.

179
00:32:04,796 --> 00:32:08,956
There's no one to help them, except God.

180
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:14,236
You should be happy
to have come to this realization.

181
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:17,836
That is God's gift to you, son.

182
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:23,636
God...

183
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:28,076
has given me great gifts
even though I don't deserve it.

184
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:31,356
I feel guilty.

185
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:36,036
I'd like to give my all.

186
00:32:37,996 --> 00:32:39,276
I want to...

187
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:43,076
know our religion
and the Qur'an much better.

188
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,076
-Please help me.
-Of course, son.

189
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:53,516
If you want to learn about
our religion and the Qur'an...

190
00:32:55,396 --> 00:33:00,436
first you have to get to know
our Prophet, Muhammad.

191
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:07,316
One day, our Mother Ayse
was asked about our Prophet's morals.

192
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:12,996
And she replied,
"His morals are the Qur'an."

193
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:18,196
Our Prophet set us an example
by living the Qur'an.

194
00:33:20,556 --> 00:33:22,916
God states in the Qur'an,

195
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:27,236
"The Messenger of God
is an excellent model

196
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:30,836
for those of you who put your hope in God
and the Last Day

197
00:33:31,796 --> 00:33:36,756
and remember Him often."

198
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:38,556
Ahmet, my son,

199
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:43,116
it is our duty to get to know
that graceful messenger...

200
00:33:44,996 --> 00:33:48,516
and apply what we learn
from him to our lives.

201
00:33:49,956 --> 00:33:53,836
He's such a precious guide that...

202
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:57,276
in every moment of his life...

203
00:33:59,156 --> 00:34:03,796
there are treasures that we
can adapt to our own lives.

204
00:34:05,156 --> 00:34:06,156
Sir...

205
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:13,676
I'd like to know this blessed person more,

206
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:15,836
understand him,

207
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:20,436
-and follow where he leads.
-Amen.

208
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:24,596
Sir...

209
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:29,116
your words warm my heart
and I want to hear more of them.

210
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:30,396
But...

211
00:34:31,716 --> 00:34:35,796
if I am to carry out the duty Ertuğrul Bey
gave to me, I must begin my journey.

212
00:34:37,756 --> 00:34:43,476
May God let our paths cross soon so that
I may listen to your warm words again.

213
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,356
We are on the same road, son.

214
00:34:47,316 --> 00:34:49,956
Always follow God's path.

215
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,316
Your journey will be hard.

216
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:59,516
But don't forget that the reward
for this journey is enormous.

217
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:03,756
Now go on your way to fight your case.

218
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:08,116
We are on your side
with an army of prayers.

219
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:12,676
Thank you, sir. May God bless you.

220
00:35:28,316 --> 00:35:31,556
-May God bless you, sir.
-Godspeed, son.

221
00:35:33,036 --> 00:35:34,276
Thank you, sir.

222
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:22,556
-Brother.
-My brother.

223
00:36:27,156 --> 00:36:28,316
Praise be!

224
00:36:29,276 --> 00:36:32,116
Brother Gundogdu will go
on the Amid expedition with Dündar Bey.

225
00:36:32,236 --> 00:36:35,876
But he said it'd be me facing
the real battle, not him.

226
00:36:36,356 --> 00:36:40,796
He said being by Ertuğrul's side is more
difficult than challenging the Crusaders.

227
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:44,876
He was right.

228
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:50,436
There won't be a mountain top without
smoke and a brave man without thunder.

229
00:36:51,836 --> 00:36:56,636
We came into this world to run towards
trouble with our swords unsheathed.

230
00:36:57,196 --> 00:37:00,036
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

231
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:07,996
-Good to see you.
-And you, my Bey.

232
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:09,436
Thank you.

233
00:37:11,236 --> 00:37:12,516
Good to see you as well!

234
00:37:14,756 --> 00:37:16,596
-Thank you, my Bey.
-Praise be!

235
00:37:19,356 --> 00:37:20,676
Good to see you.

236
00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:24,196
My Bey, you got there just in time.

237
00:37:24,436 --> 00:37:26,836
-Just in time.
-Praise be!

238
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:30,836
You put Günalp Bey in his place.

239
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:34,276
I believe Günalp Bey's
intentions were honorable.

240
00:37:35,436 --> 00:37:40,076
But... his loyalty to that dog Sadettin

241
00:37:40,516 --> 00:37:43,116
might cause problems
for us in the future.

242
00:37:45,116 --> 00:37:46,476
-Artuk Bey.
-Yes, my Bey.

243
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:50,676
I entrust the castle first to God
and then to you.

244
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:57,716
Sadettin thrust Günalp Bey
in here like a rusty dagger.

245
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:02,916
We'll make sure Günalp Bey acts
according to our commands

246
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:06,276
not Sadettin's provocations.

247
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:11,996
My Bey, if this man is all about
the survival of the state,

248
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,556
it could make things
more difficult for us.

249
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:20,436
I haven't come here only to kiss
my mother's hand, Ertuğrul Bey.

250
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:26,196
I'll stay by your side until we can
free our state from Sadettin's grip.

251
00:38:27,476 --> 00:38:31,436
If we can't find some way
of overcoming that scoundrel...

252
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:35,796
he'll destroy the Kayis
and the rest of the Turk tribes.

253
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,676
-Know that I'm at your service.
-Thank you, brother.

254
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:46,996
I want to know everything Günalp Bey does.

255
00:38:48,396 --> 00:38:50,716
Make sure he doesn't step out of line.

256
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:57,476
If he does, you know what to do.

257
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,156
-As you command, my Bey.
-As you command, my Bey.

258
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:03,716
My Bey, where is Ahmet Alp?

259
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:07,396
So, he's following God's path
and is our brother now.

260
00:39:08,316 --> 00:39:10,836
That's right. That's right, Bamsı.

261
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:14,116
He's following us with İbn-i Arabi.

262
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:16,596
When Arabi gets to the tribe...

263
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:20,956
Ahmet will be with Bilecik's governor.

264
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:26,036
He'll infiltrate them
and send us intelligence.

265
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:30,076
-May God help him, my Bey.
-Amen, Artuk Bey. Amen.

266
00:39:30,156 --> 00:39:31,116
Amen.

267
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:40,236
-Bamsı!
-My Hafsa!

268
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,556
My Hafsa! My Hafsa!

269
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:45,556
Aslıhan.

270
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:55,436
Thank God.

271
00:39:56,076 --> 00:39:57,356
Thank heaven.

272
00:39:59,036 --> 00:40:00,116
Come in.

273
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,276
My Bey.

274
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:08,756
Ertuğrul Bey, thank you.

275
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:11,116
May God bless you, my Bey.

276
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:14,716
Thank you, Hatuns. Thank you.

277
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:20,036
Now, let's get back to the tribe.

278
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:22,916
There are things I want to tell you there.

279
00:40:38,676 --> 00:40:40,196
Ertuğrul is a warrior.

280
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:45,156
-He's loyal to his state.
-We can't be sure of that, Bey.

281
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:52,876
I believe he has
good intentions, Aydogmus.

282
00:40:55,796 --> 00:40:57,596
But he's stubborn.

283
00:40:58,396 --> 00:41:01,956
He doesn't know that Emir Sadettin
is like a father to me.

284
00:41:03,316 --> 00:41:05,276
He doesn't know his limits
and that bothers me.

285
00:41:06,556 --> 00:41:11,796
The real problem is that his obstinacy
might prove a disaster for our state.

286
00:41:14,156 --> 00:41:16,036
There's no doubt Ertuğrul Bey is loyal

287
00:41:16,116 --> 00:41:18,396
to our sultan's brother,
Sehzade Kilicarslan.

288
00:41:19,676 --> 00:41:21,796
It isn't only the Emir
who’s worried by that.

289
00:41:22,676 --> 00:41:24,356
The whole palace is.

290
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:27,636
If that's the case...

291
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:32,916
I'll kill Ertuğrul Bey
with my own hands.

292
00:41:34,996 --> 00:41:37,876
I lost my mother, my father

293
00:41:38,676 --> 00:41:41,676
and my brothers in Sehzade's wars.

294
00:41:43,156 --> 00:41:44,796
I won't lose my state too.

295
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:49,836
I want to know every step
Ertuğrul Bey takes.

296
00:41:51,796 --> 00:41:53,316
I hear of it first...

297
00:41:55,276 --> 00:41:56,596
then Emir Sadettin does.

298
00:41:58,556 --> 00:41:59,836
Yes, my Bey.

299
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:52,836
Hell Warriors.

300
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,476
I've finally found you.

301
00:43:11,516 --> 00:43:15,276
My God, help me in this difficult duty.

302
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:32,956
Hell Warriors!

303
00:43:33,876 --> 00:43:34,916
That's Ares.

304
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,796
What are you doing here?

305
00:44:04,756 --> 00:44:06,196
Pack up.

306
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:08,676
We're going to see Bilecik's governor.

307
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:12,116
What are you going to do
with Bilecik's governor?

308
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,676
I'm going to ask for his support
to get my revenge on Ertuğrul.

309
00:44:19,476 --> 00:44:22,476
You went to Konya and ratted us out
to the Turk's sultan.

310
00:44:23,116 --> 00:44:25,596
The great warrior Titan
died because of you.

311
00:44:26,356 --> 00:44:30,596
You think a pathetic loser like you
could get his revenge on Ertuğrul?

312
00:44:33,756 --> 00:44:35,156
I never sold out.

313
00:44:37,236 --> 00:44:39,476
I was defeated but I didn't die.

314
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:43,756
Now, you follow me.

315
00:44:44,636 --> 00:44:48,276
We'll get our revenge on those barbaric
Turks with the help of Bilecik's governor.

316
00:44:52,796 --> 00:44:56,036
Did you hear him?
We're supposed to follow his orders.

317
00:44:56,556 --> 00:44:59,076
First you must pay
for what you've done, Ares.

318
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:02,916
Hell Warriors... Attack.

319
00:45:04,596 --> 00:45:06,836
What do you think you're doing?
I'm the governor!

320
00:45:35,076 --> 00:45:38,716
A defeated, pathetic,
miserable former governor.

321
00:45:46,196 --> 00:45:49,196
Let's take him to the cave.
I'm not finished with him.

322
00:46:34,236 --> 00:46:40,796
We cannot allow Ertuğrul to get stronger
like he did under Sultan Alaeddin.

323
00:46:47,476 --> 00:46:52,076
Günalp Bey is loyal to me.
He won't let that happen.

324
00:46:54,876 --> 00:46:56,916
You tell me that he's an honest man.

325
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,716
What if he takes Ertuğrul Bey's side?

326
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:04,676
His aide Aydogmus is a dependable man.

327
00:47:06,516 --> 00:47:11,036
I'll be the first one to hear of it
if Günalp makes a mistake.

328
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,156
I'll punish him myself.

329
00:47:15,596 --> 00:47:16,676
Very good.

330
00:47:17,356 --> 00:47:21,636
Giyaseddin knows everything
but pretends that he doesn't.

331
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:25,356
He wants everyone to believe that
his father died of natural causes.

332
00:47:27,396 --> 00:47:29,436
He obviously knows us
better than we thought.

333
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:34,636
Don't you dare push his buttons, Sadettin.

334
00:47:36,716 --> 00:47:37,636
Don't worry.

335
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:42,876
Ertuğrul's next target will be Söğüt.

336
00:47:44,396 --> 00:47:48,636
If he takes Söğüt over too, he'll be
one step closer to a state of his own.

337
00:47:49,436 --> 00:47:53,036
Do you think the letter of peace
you sent to Bilecik's Governor, Kritos

338
00:47:53,516 --> 00:47:55,636
will resolve the matter?

339
00:47:57,316 --> 00:48:02,756
I'll use the governor as a hammer,
and Günalp as the anvil.

340
00:48:03,516 --> 00:48:05,556
Bilecik's governor is full of hate

341
00:48:05,636 --> 00:48:10,236
because his son Angelos
was killed by Ertuğrul's alps.

342
00:48:11,636 --> 00:48:14,236
We'll use that hate
to our full advantage.

343
00:48:14,756 --> 00:48:18,236
This truce must put a stop to Ertuğrul.

344
00:48:18,756 --> 00:48:20,836
This absolutely must end here.

345
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:32,556
{\an8}BILECIK CASTLE

346
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:38,236
My God!

347
00:48:39,636 --> 00:48:42,036
Help me get my revenge on the Turks

348
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:47,156
who sent my son's head to me
and fed his body to wild animals.

349
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:54,196
I'll avenge you eventually, son.

350
00:49:06,116 --> 00:49:07,276
Enter!

351
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:15,036
Governor Kritos, a letter has
come for you from Emir Sadettin.

352
00:49:34,756 --> 00:49:39,316
My prayers have been answered, Leo.
My prayers have been answered.

353
00:49:40,356 --> 00:49:41,876
What does it say, sir?

354
00:49:42,636 --> 00:49:43,916
Emir Sadettin...

355
00:49:45,756 --> 00:49:50,436
wants to make a peace treaty with me
just like he did with Vasilius and Ares.

356
00:49:51,796 --> 00:49:53,836
But what he really
wants is Ertuğrul's head.

357
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,836
And I'll give it to him.

358
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:06,916
It says they're prepared to give Söğüt
to us as a mark of their good will,

359
00:50:07,316 --> 00:50:11,156
on the condition we keep paying
the taxes we paid to Alaeddin.

360
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:15,236
It makes sense for him to
want to cooperate with us

361
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:17,516
when Sultan Giyaseddin is getting
ready for the Amid war.

362
00:50:18,156 --> 00:50:21,516
What about Ertuğrul?
What's going to happen to him?

363
00:50:21,996 --> 00:50:26,196
I heard that he was found
innocent and got his position back.

364
00:50:26,636 --> 00:50:29,116
Ertuğrul will never sit
at the same table as us.

365
00:50:30,036 --> 00:50:34,436
It says I will be discussing
the peace treaty with Günalp Bey.

366
00:50:35,756 --> 00:50:38,156
Ertuğrul won't let that happen.

367
00:50:39,596 --> 00:50:41,516
He knows that too.

368
00:50:42,156 --> 00:50:45,476
His intention is to
let me deal with Ertuğrul.

369
00:50:47,516 --> 00:50:52,396
Neither the sultan nor the state
will support Ertuğrul.

370
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,156
Ertuğrul is a lone wolf
and has been disowned by his state.

371
00:50:56,676 --> 00:50:58,836
We all know what happens
to the lone wolf, Leo.

372
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:04,196
I'll take Söğüt first
and Ertuğrul's head second.

373
00:53:27,428 --> 00:53:28,428
Sir...

374
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:37,508
Come, my girl.

375
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:49,188
Sir, whose is this blessed child?

376
00:53:50,508 --> 00:53:53,348
This brave and blessed boy is your son.

377
00:53:54,308 --> 00:53:55,548
He is Osman, Halime Hatun.

378
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:02,868
Many a valiant man
came and passed through these lands.

379
00:54:03,668 --> 00:54:06,988
Osman will be one of the most blessed,
God willing.

380
00:54:10,868 --> 00:54:14,148
Osman is an almighty plane tree, my girl.

381
00:54:15,908 --> 00:54:17,828
His grandeur will surround the world.

382
00:54:18,748 --> 00:54:23,108
His branches will reach the skies
and protect all humanity.

383
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:25,948
His roots will cross continents

384
00:54:26,348 --> 00:54:27,748
and spread to all lands.

385
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:33,268
A brave man to come from his lineage...

386
00:54:35,308 --> 00:54:36,788
will be the subject of...

387
00:54:37,948 --> 00:54:41,148
our Prophet's <i>hadith</i>:

388
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:45,788
"Constantinople will surely be conquered.
The commander who conquers it...

389
00:54:46,588 --> 00:54:50,188
is such a commander,
and the army, such an army."

390
00:54:51,668 --> 00:54:53,028
Hopefully, sir.

391
00:54:55,108 --> 00:54:57,908
Don't forget, my girl.
The mother makes a family.

392
00:54:59,348 --> 00:55:02,068
She gathers everyone around her
and warms them.

393
00:55:02,948 --> 00:55:04,148
Mother means home.

394
00:55:05,108 --> 00:55:08,148
She feeds, accommodates, protects.

395
00:55:09,548 --> 00:55:11,308
Our Lord commands...

396
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:15,148
"Heaven is beneath mothers' feet."

397
00:55:17,308 --> 00:55:19,948
That is how sacred
the position of motherhood is.

398
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:26,508
You are lucky to be
the mother of such a blessed, brave child.

399
00:55:29,268 --> 00:55:30,988
May God render you worthy of it.

400
00:55:31,468 --> 00:55:33,188
Amen, sir. Amen.

401
00:55:55,868 --> 00:55:58,268
Osman is entrusted first to God...

402
00:55:59,228 --> 00:56:00,828
then to you.

403
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:03,108
Take him.

404
00:56:13,028 --> 00:56:14,388
My Osman!

405
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:15,588
My brave one.

406
00:56:17,228 --> 00:56:18,628
My glorious son.

407
00:57:23,388 --> 00:57:24,388
My God...

408
00:57:25,588 --> 00:57:27,868
Your wisdom is not to be questioned.

409
00:57:28,788 --> 00:57:34,468
Thank you for granting me
such a blessed dream.

410
00:57:35,548 --> 00:57:37,588
May it be for the good.

411
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:40,308
My God...

412
00:57:41,348 --> 00:57:43,668
Just as you foretold in my dream,

413
00:57:43,948 --> 00:57:45,748
grant me a blessed child.

414
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:52,788
Grant me the power to raise
this blessed child righteously.

415
00:58:06,748 --> 00:58:07,748
My God.

416
00:58:08,308 --> 00:58:09,588
Thank you.

417
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:12,508
Thank you.

418
00:58:16,388 --> 00:58:17,388
Mother!

419
00:58:17,508 --> 00:58:18,668
-Mother!
-Gündüz.

420
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:20,988
My father is back, Mother. He's back!

421
00:58:21,468 --> 00:58:22,708
Your father?

422
00:58:24,228 --> 00:58:27,148
God, one piece of good news after another.

423
00:58:30,388 --> 00:58:31,548
My sons.

424
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:38,308
Thank God for giving you to me.

425
00:58:39,508 --> 00:58:40,948
My brave boys.

426
00:58:45,548 --> 00:58:46,988
My brave boys.

427
00:58:48,948 --> 00:58:50,108
Come on, Mother, come!

428
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:53,708
Let's go, Gündüz. <i>Bismillah.</i>

429
00:59:29,948 --> 00:59:32,468
Gündüz. What is this?

430
00:59:33,508 --> 00:59:34,948
My father is here, Grandmother.

431
00:59:35,748 --> 00:59:36,748
Where?

432
00:59:43,228 --> 00:59:44,908
-My son.
-Ertuğrul.

433
00:59:47,068 --> 00:59:48,068
Mother.

434
00:59:49,908 --> 00:59:50,908
My son!

435
00:59:54,588 --> 00:59:55,588
Halime.

436
00:59:55,788 --> 00:59:57,108
-Ertuğrul.
-Halime.

437
00:59:58,148 --> 00:59:59,148
Welcome.

438
00:59:59,468 --> 01:00:00,788
Glad to be here.

439
01:00:01,148 --> 01:00:02,148
Glad to be here.

440
01:00:23,188 --> 01:00:26,428
My God. He spared you for us.

441
01:00:27,268 --> 01:00:29,668
You came with no hindrance.

442
01:00:29,868 --> 01:00:31,388
Thank God for that.

443
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:34,428
Thank God, Mother.

444
01:00:36,548 --> 01:00:38,228
Thanks to Ertuğrul Bey.

445
01:00:39,628 --> 01:00:41,068
It's God's will, brother.

446
01:00:44,388 --> 01:00:45,388
Gündüz.

447
01:00:46,428 --> 01:00:47,428
My brave son.

448
01:00:47,788 --> 01:00:48,868
Father.

449
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:52,228
Just look at my brave son.

450
01:00:53,468 --> 01:00:54,468
Tell me,

451
01:00:54,828 --> 01:00:57,348
did anything bad happen
while I was away from the village?

452
01:00:57,428 --> 01:01:02,388
Who would dare do anything when Ertuğrul
Bey's son, Gündüz Alp, is here, my bey?

453
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:06,388
Good for you.

454
01:01:07,508 --> 01:01:10,108
He even took me for the enemy
and drew his sword on me.

455
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:15,908
He has become a valiant alp.

456
01:01:17,228 --> 01:01:18,788
Thank you, Sungur Bey.

457
01:01:20,508 --> 01:01:24,548
My boy will follow in his father's
footsteps and become a bey, God willing.

458
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:25,668
-God willing.
-God willing.

459
01:01:26,868 --> 01:01:28,508
Thank God.

460
01:01:29,628 --> 01:01:31,428
I saw you together...

461
01:01:35,068 --> 01:01:37,228
If only I'd see my Gündoğdu and Dündar...

462
01:01:39,788 --> 01:01:41,068
What else would I want for?

463
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:43,748
You will see them too, Mother.

464
01:01:44,348 --> 01:01:45,348
You will.

465
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:48,508
Hopefully, my son, hopefully.

466
01:01:48,828 --> 01:01:49,828
Hopefully.

467
01:02:00,548 --> 01:02:02,748
First with God's permission,

468
01:02:03,188 --> 01:02:06,868
then with the efforts of our bey,
Ertuğrul, and our alps,

469
01:02:06,988 --> 01:02:08,788
we raised our flags at the castle.

470
01:02:09,908 --> 01:02:10,788
Good.

471
01:02:12,388 --> 01:02:13,668
As a castle commander,

472
01:02:14,828 --> 01:02:18,708
I know how hard it is to both conquer
and manage a castle.

473
01:02:20,308 --> 01:02:23,668
Ertuğrul Bey turned out to be
stronger than I thought.

474
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:36,548
How did you become a castle commander,
Günalp Bey?

475
01:02:38,268 --> 01:02:39,268
Commanding a castle...

476
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:43,588
Commanding is my ancestral heritage.

477
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:45,628
Were they commanders as well?

478
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:52,028
In the struggle for the throne among
Sultan Alaeddin and Sultan İzzettin,

479
01:02:52,948 --> 01:02:54,828
we took Sultan Alaeddin's side.

480
01:02:58,468 --> 01:03:00,108
We paid a heavy price for that.

481
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:07,828
My father.

482
01:03:09,028 --> 01:03:10,028
My mother.

483
01:03:11,428 --> 01:03:12,428
My siblings.

484
01:03:15,148 --> 01:03:16,188
They were all killed.

485
01:03:17,828 --> 01:03:19,028
How did you survive?

486
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,468
May God grant him long life...

487
01:03:23,628 --> 01:03:25,308
Ameer Sadettin saved me.

488
01:03:27,388 --> 01:03:29,268
He took me in and raised me.

489
01:03:30,148 --> 01:03:31,148
And I never once

490
01:03:31,788 --> 01:03:34,948
swayed from my loyalty to our state
and to him.

491
01:03:38,908 --> 01:03:42,428
From this day forth to the end of my days

492
01:03:42,988 --> 01:03:46,148
I will never sway in my loyalty

493
01:03:47,268 --> 01:03:50,708
to our state, our sultan,

494
01:03:51,268 --> 01:03:52,548
and Ameer Sadettin.

495
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:15,388
Thank God.

496
01:04:16,988 --> 01:04:20,788
We did away with the traitors' traps
and are together once again.

497
01:04:21,788 --> 01:04:23,748
May God render our prosperity eternal.

498
01:04:24,268 --> 01:04:25,268
Amen.

499
01:04:27,628 --> 01:04:31,588
Our state has now been overrun
by jackals...

500
01:04:32,508 --> 01:04:34,228
The unworthy have taken command.

501
01:04:35,468 --> 01:04:36,468
Therefore...

502
01:04:37,348 --> 01:04:42,628
we need to migrate to Söğüt, the land
our late Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad gave us.

503
01:04:51,108 --> 01:04:53,628
However you see fit, my bey.

504
01:04:53,908 --> 01:04:56,668
So long as we are all together.

505
01:04:56,988 --> 01:04:59,788
With God's help,
we will defeat traitors anywhere.

506
01:05:00,388 --> 01:05:01,388
With God's help.

507
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:02,988
But, of course,

508
01:05:03,828 --> 01:05:05,868
it won't be easy to make Söğüt our land.

509
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:18,188
Even though our sultan conquered it
and imposed taxes on it,

510
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:20,868
it's still under the control of
the Tekfur of Bilecik.

511
01:05:22,228 --> 01:05:25,628
The Tekfur of Bilecik
will also want to avenge his son.

512
01:05:26,268 --> 01:05:29,468
I don't know why
but that makes my palms itch.

513
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:37,708
And what a palms they are!

514
01:05:37,788 --> 01:05:39,108
Thank you, Turgut Bey.

515
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,948
We will scratch them together,
side by side.

516
01:05:46,268 --> 01:05:50,988
If God permits, we will take by force
the lands that are rightfully ours.

517
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:56,268
We are with you as the Cavdar Tribe
until the last drop of our blood, my bey.

518
01:05:58,028 --> 01:06:00,108
Thank you.

519
01:06:09,148 --> 01:06:14,228
We are capable of claiming what is ours
with our own swords, with God's help.

520
01:06:14,508 --> 01:06:15,908
With God's help.

521
01:06:16,388 --> 01:06:17,548
With God's help, my bey.

522
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:21,268
Good for you.

523
01:06:23,468 --> 01:06:24,468
Hatuns...

524
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:28,028
Start preparations for migration
as soon as possible.

525
01:06:29,788 --> 01:06:30,908
Yes, my bey.

526
01:06:57,428 --> 01:06:59,428
What is it, esteemed Tekfur?

527
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,068
We crushed you.

528
01:07:06,308 --> 01:07:08,188
Is that how you plan to join us?

529
01:07:24,028 --> 01:07:27,348
You think you have crushed me?

530
01:07:32,588 --> 01:07:34,908
I am stronger than you,
even in this state.

531
01:07:39,988 --> 01:07:41,748
Look what he's babbling.

532
01:07:42,948 --> 01:07:44,748
We must've hit you too hard in the head.

533
01:07:45,348 --> 01:07:46,548
You've lost it.

534
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:52,908
If you have the courage...

535
01:07:55,388 --> 01:07:56,948
come fight me one on one.

536
01:08:01,228 --> 01:08:04,268
I guess you won't be able to take the pain
and want to die right away.

537
01:08:08,068 --> 01:08:09,468
Kill me if you can.

538
01:08:10,988 --> 01:08:13,308
But be brave enough to fight on your own.

539
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:16,948
Not with all your men.

540
01:08:17,868 --> 01:08:20,628
Then we'll see how strong you are.

541
01:08:22,668 --> 01:08:25,348
Then we'll see how brave you are.

542
01:08:29,868 --> 01:08:31,028
Untie him.

543
01:08:43,508 --> 01:08:46,548
Get up, it's time for fun.

544
01:08:52,348 --> 01:08:53,668
Courage, you say...

545
01:08:54,348 --> 01:08:55,948
You'll regret it.

546
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:32,188
You are all under my command
until we rid these lands of the Turks.

547
01:09:37,348 --> 01:09:39,508
Do you want vengeance from the Turks?

548
01:09:40,108 --> 01:09:41,108
Yes!

549
01:09:41,268 --> 01:09:43,468
Do you want to make them pay for Titan?

550
01:09:43,548 --> 01:09:46,868
Yes!

551
01:09:46,988 --> 01:09:49,268
Revenge!

552
01:09:49,348 --> 01:09:52,828
Blood!

553
01:09:53,228 --> 01:09:56,868
Gather your things.
We go to the Tekfur of Bilecik.

554
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:32,828
Artuk Bey. Someone is here.

555
01:10:33,108 --> 01:10:34,868
He wants to talk to you in private.

556
01:10:35,428 --> 01:10:37,188
Who is it? Do you know him?

557
01:10:37,868 --> 01:10:38,948
We don't, my bey.

558
01:10:39,308 --> 01:10:41,588
We looked at his outfit. He is no alp.

559
01:10:41,788 --> 01:10:43,388
And he is not a civilian either.

560
01:10:45,668 --> 01:10:46,948
Let him in.

561
01:10:57,948 --> 01:10:58,948
Where does the road lead?

562
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:22,028
To the Red Apple.

563
01:11:31,308 --> 01:11:33,188
With greetings from my governor
to Ertuğrul Bey.

564
01:11:36,348 --> 01:11:37,348
<i>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

565
01:11:51,108 --> 01:11:53,708
<i>Shahzade Kılıçarslan</i>
<i>and his mother Melike Hatun</i>

566
01:11:53,828 --> 01:11:57,028
<i>are being taken to the Castle of Ankara</i>
<i>by Altun Aba.</i>

567
01:11:57,428 --> 01:11:59,748
<i>We think they will be slaughtered.</i>

568
01:11:59,908 --> 01:12:02,388
<i>As for the sultan's will</i>
<i>and the state's prosperity,</i>

569
01:12:02,508 --> 01:12:05,188
<i>an important mission</i>
<i>falls to Ertuğrul Bey.</i>

570
01:12:07,388 --> 01:12:09,868
Ertuğrul Bey should get moving
before it's too late.

571
01:12:10,468 --> 01:12:11,668
What is it, Artuk Bey?

572
01:12:11,988 --> 01:12:14,028
Dumrul, I need to ride to the village
right away.

573
01:12:14,188 --> 01:12:17,948
You stay here. Keep an eye on Günalp Bey.

574
01:12:18,188 --> 01:12:19,588
Watch his every move.

575
01:12:20,268 --> 01:12:21,268
Yes, my bey.

576
01:12:21,908 --> 01:12:22,908
Door!

577
01:13:45,428 --> 01:13:46,748
Mother!

578
01:13:48,668 --> 01:13:49,668
Mother!

579
01:13:51,148 --> 01:13:52,468
<i>Permission to enter, my bey.</i>

580
01:14:02,428 --> 01:14:03,388
Come in.

581
01:14:11,268 --> 01:14:13,228
Artuk Bey secretly left the castle,
my bey.

582
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:22,508
I believe he's heading for
the Kayi village.

583
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:30,748
He must be going to Ertuğrul Bey.

584
01:14:32,388 --> 01:14:33,788
They are up to something.

585
01:14:35,428 --> 01:14:37,508
Get my horse ready. We ride.

586
01:14:39,028 --> 01:14:40,668
We will follow Artuk Bey.

587
01:14:41,228 --> 01:14:42,348
Yes, my bey.

588
01:14:54,588 --> 01:14:55,548
Door!

589
01:15:43,148 --> 01:15:44,148
My bey...

590
01:15:45,468 --> 01:15:47,068
I keep thinking but...

591
01:15:48,228 --> 01:15:50,908
I can't wrap my head around
this migration business.

592
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,108
What would we do there?

593
01:15:54,828 --> 01:15:57,508
We've been through so much
on these lands

594
01:15:57,828 --> 01:15:59,308
throughout the years.

595
01:16:10,348 --> 01:16:13,108
How can we move there now,
leaving behind this place

596
01:16:13,588 --> 01:16:15,348
that we worked so hard to get?

597
01:16:15,788 --> 01:16:18,028
And the Byzantine infidels
won't leave us alone there.

598
01:16:29,908 --> 01:16:31,068
I understand your concern.

599
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:34,028
But don't you worry.

600
01:16:35,348 --> 01:16:40,108
We have gained many a victory,
crossing plains and great mountains.

601
01:16:40,948 --> 01:16:45,788
With God's help, we know how to
make a new home on the land of our sultan.

602
01:16:47,788 --> 01:16:48,788
If need be,

603
01:16:50,228 --> 01:16:52,148
we will even take on the emperor.

604
01:16:58,068 --> 01:16:59,068
Turgut...

605
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:02,588
You know well that since the sultan died

606
01:17:02,908 --> 01:17:05,948
there isn't anyone left
to support us as before.

607
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:10,628
Ameer Sadettin has taken over the state.

608
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,988
He holds a grudge not only against...

609
01:17:15,988 --> 01:17:18,868
our Ertuğrul Bey but you and me.

610
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:24,188
Do you think it would be wise
for our bey, Ertuğrul, to reconsider?

611
01:17:33,708 --> 01:17:34,708
Aslıhan.

612
01:17:35,668 --> 01:17:37,788
If Ertuğrul Bey made a decision,

613
01:17:38,308 --> 01:17:40,108
he would have reached it
by splitting hairs.

614
01:17:41,828 --> 01:17:42,988
Don't worry.

615
01:17:44,588 --> 01:17:47,468
Let alone Ameer Sadettin...

616
01:17:48,068 --> 01:17:51,108
We will do away with those bastards
even if they're united.

617
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:04,228
As long as we are one,

618
01:18:05,028 --> 01:18:07,828
nobody can break us,
with God's permission.

619
01:19:17,428 --> 01:19:18,428
Halime...

620
01:19:24,228 --> 01:19:25,588
Welcome, Ertuğrul.

621
01:19:25,788 --> 01:19:26,788
Happy to be here.

622
01:19:34,668 --> 01:19:35,668
Halime...

623
01:19:36,988 --> 01:19:38,788
Your eyes shine somewhat differently.

624
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:42,348
Your face smiles somewhat differently.

625
01:19:43,868 --> 01:19:45,068
What is behind this?

626
01:19:49,428 --> 01:19:50,428
Ertuğrul.

627
01:19:54,508 --> 01:19:56,268
I've been feeling it for some time.

628
01:19:59,188 --> 01:20:00,188
Now that...

629
01:20:01,668 --> 01:20:04,028
I've been to the midwives, I am sure.

630
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:07,468
Midwives?

631
01:20:14,428 --> 01:20:15,308
Are you...?

632
01:20:19,908 --> 01:20:21,108
I'm with child, Ertuğrul.

633
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:24,308
If it's a boy,

634
01:20:24,908 --> 01:20:27,148
I carry our son Osman in my womb.

635
01:20:29,788 --> 01:20:30,628
Osman?

636
01:20:38,268 --> 01:20:40,268
Ertuğrul, don't do something crazy.

637
01:20:40,748 --> 01:20:45,388
-Ertuğrul!
-Oh, God!

638
01:20:50,628 --> 01:20:51,628
Ertuğrul...

639
01:20:53,508 --> 01:20:54,508
Halime...

640
01:21:09,308 --> 01:21:10,308
My Halime.

641
01:21:10,988 --> 01:21:11,908
My Halime.

642
01:21:18,908 --> 01:21:22,908
Our great Oğuz ancestors
had heralded this in my dreams.

643
01:21:23,348 --> 01:21:24,788
Our Osman arrives, my Halime.

644
01:21:25,628 --> 01:21:26,628
Osman...

645
01:21:27,068 --> 01:21:28,988
He entered my dreams too, Ertuğrul.

646
01:21:29,868 --> 01:21:32,788
Ibn Al Arabi gave him to me to hold.

647
01:21:33,748 --> 01:21:36,548
He said that he would be a brave man
that conquers worlds.

648
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:40,828
Great God.

649
01:21:41,868 --> 01:21:43,668
Thank you, my God.

650
01:21:44,148 --> 01:21:45,308
Thank you.

651
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:51,228
May our dreams bode well.

652
01:21:52,508 --> 01:21:57,188
May our Osman be born in our new land

653
01:21:57,508 --> 01:21:59,188
and shine like a sun upon us.
God willing.

654
01:21:59,268 --> 01:22:00,268
God willing.

655
01:22:01,428 --> 01:22:02,428
God willing.

656
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:08,148
<i>Permission to enter, Son.</i>

657
01:22:09,028 --> 01:22:10,028
Ertuğrul.

658
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:14,228
Come, Mother. Come.

659
01:22:21,428 --> 01:22:24,308
What is it, Son?
You are shaking the ground.

660
01:22:31,628 --> 01:22:33,268
We are having a baby, Mother.

661
01:22:33,668 --> 01:22:34,868
We are having a baby.

662
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:39,468
-Our Osman comes, God willing.
-My God...

663
01:22:40,148 --> 01:22:42,068
My God, thank you.

664
01:22:42,548 --> 01:22:44,908
I'd die for a rejoiceful night like this.

665
01:22:49,948 --> 01:22:50,948
My brave son...

666
01:22:54,868 --> 01:22:55,868
Oh, my brave...

667
01:22:59,028 --> 01:23:00,028
Mother...

668
01:23:00,868 --> 01:23:01,948
My doe-eyed girl...

669
01:23:22,108 --> 01:23:23,108
My beautiful bride.

670
01:23:25,628 --> 01:23:26,668
Thank God.

671
01:23:27,748 --> 01:23:30,068
May it be for the good, my daughter.

672
01:23:30,628 --> 01:23:32,508
Thank you, Mother. Thank you.

673
01:23:34,428 --> 01:23:35,428
My brave son.

674
01:23:37,028 --> 01:23:39,828
May God give you a great son...

675
01:23:41,108 --> 01:23:43,388
who will carry on your ancestral name.

676
01:23:43,908 --> 01:23:46,508
Hopefully, Mother. Hopefully.

677
01:23:49,388 --> 01:23:50,468
It is my command, Mother.

678
01:23:51,188 --> 01:23:53,068
In honor of this great news,

679
01:23:53,468 --> 01:23:57,308
may sheep and goats on our land be
cut and distributed to the people.

680
01:23:59,068 --> 01:24:00,508
May the hungry be fed.

681
01:24:00,868 --> 01:24:02,468
May the naked be clothed.

682
01:24:02,828 --> 01:24:04,348
May the orphans be given alms.

683
01:24:05,348 --> 01:24:07,108
May debts of the indebted be closed.

684
01:24:07,748 --> 01:24:11,228
And God willing, may we hold
a great celebration in no time.

685
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:14,108
May there be mountains of meat
and streams of buttermilk...

686
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:16,228
at the event.

687
01:24:16,588 --> 01:24:19,148
May God always keep you above us, my son.

688
01:24:22,068 --> 01:24:23,748
As you wish, my son.

689
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:30,148
I'll go.

690
01:24:43,508 --> 01:24:44,508
Halime...

691
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:47,708
Come...

692
01:24:48,908 --> 01:24:50,908
Let's perform ablution with pure water

693
01:24:51,508 --> 01:24:52,988
and perform prayers of thankfulness.

694
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:54,548
As you wish, my bey.

695
01:25:04,668 --> 01:25:05,908
Thank you, God.

696
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:54,068
Thank you, my brave boy.

697
01:26:03,988 --> 01:26:05,388
<i>Permission to enter, my bey.</i>

698
01:26:05,988 --> 01:26:07,228
Come in, Abdur Rahman.

699
01:26:12,268 --> 01:26:13,628
Artuk Bey has arrived, my bey.

700
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:14,868
Let him in.

701
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:28,308
What is it, Artuk Bey?

702
01:26:42,468 --> 01:26:43,668
Speak, Artuk Bey.

703
01:26:44,588 --> 01:26:46,708
A messenger came
from the white-bearded ones.

704
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,108
He brought this letter.

705
01:26:59,148 --> 01:27:00,468
What does it say, Ertuğrul Bey?

706
01:27:06,468 --> 01:27:09,468
They are going to slaughter
Shahzade Kılıçarslan and his mother.

707
01:27:11,948 --> 01:27:14,468
Atabey Altun Aba is their leader.

708
01:27:21,108 --> 01:27:24,468
<i>You know I will go on a campaign tomorrow</i>
<i>with my army, Ertuğrul.</i>

709
01:27:25,588 --> 01:27:29,788
You are the closest witness
that there is treachery in my palace.

710
01:27:30,628 --> 01:27:34,748
I have to think of my state’s perpetuity
after I die.

711
01:27:35,108 --> 01:27:39,188
That's why I added to my will
the shahzade I want to take my place.

712
01:27:40,028 --> 01:27:43,068
In my will,
I commanded Shahzade Kılıçarslan,

713
01:27:43,588 --> 01:27:49,348
son of Melike Hatun,
to replace me as sultan.

714
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:54,868
Appointing Shahzade Kılıçarslan
as your heir

715
01:27:55,308 --> 01:27:58,548
will not only strengthen
our relations with the Ayyubids,

716
01:27:59,068 --> 01:28:02,108
but also allow us
to form a stronger alliance

717
01:28:02,268 --> 01:28:04,588
with the Muslim world against the Mongols.

718
01:28:05,188 --> 01:28:07,148
I'm telling you about my will so that

719
01:28:08,068 --> 01:28:09,068
in the event that...

720
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:12,788
there is a struggle among my sons
for the throne,

721
01:28:13,228 --> 01:28:15,308
I want you to pick a side.

722
01:28:16,388 --> 01:28:18,388
<i>My side is always evident, my sultan.</i>

723
01:28:18,788 --> 01:28:20,028
<i>Know that I say this</i>

724
01:28:20,588 --> 01:28:22,868
<i>not with my tongue, but with my heart.</i>

725
01:28:23,468 --> 01:28:24,788
When that day comes,

726
01:28:24,948 --> 01:28:27,068
no matter what the outcome,

727
01:28:27,868 --> 01:28:30,988
I would like you to take your place
next to Shahzade Kılıçarslan

728
01:28:31,228 --> 01:28:33,828
and fight together with all
the Turk tribes under your Beyhood.

729
01:28:34,588 --> 01:28:37,268
May God protect us
from such a struggle for the throne

730
01:28:37,668 --> 01:28:41,268
and the cruelty of any enemy that may
use it to its advantage, my sultan.

731
01:28:41,348 --> 01:28:42,228
Amen.

732
01:28:43,188 --> 01:28:46,348
<i>They are going to slaughter</i>
<i>Shahzade Kılıçarslan and his mother.</i>

733
01:28:46,668 --> 01:28:47,988
I can't let that happen.

734
01:28:48,068 --> 01:28:50,708
We can't go to the Ankara Castle
and get them out, my bey.

735
01:28:50,908 --> 01:28:53,628
We will catch up with them
before they reach the Ankara Castle.

736
01:28:54,068 --> 01:28:57,028
If they don't slaughter them
before they get to the castle.

737
01:28:58,948 --> 01:29:00,228
What will you do, my bey?

738
01:29:01,868 --> 01:29:03,748
Tell the alps to get ready immediately.

739
01:29:04,348 --> 01:29:06,108
Turgut and Bamsi
will ride with me as well.

740
01:29:07,148 --> 01:29:11,628
Ertuğrul Bey, I found out
why Günalp Bey is so loyal to Köpek.

741
01:29:13,308 --> 01:29:15,828
You were right. His intentions are pure.

742
01:29:16,148 --> 01:29:18,028
His father was castle commander Tayı Bey.

743
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:22,068
May he rest in peace.

744
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:25,188
I remember they fought
together with my father.

745
01:29:25,988 --> 01:29:27,868
He was a valiant man, loyal to his state.

746
01:29:28,548 --> 01:29:31,548
My bey. He was slaughtered
together with his wife

747
01:29:31,628 --> 01:29:33,708
for his loyalty to Sultan Alaeddin.

748
01:29:35,508 --> 01:29:37,628
Köpek took him in and raised him.

749
01:29:39,388 --> 01:29:41,588
That is why he is so loyal to Köpek.

750
01:29:41,868 --> 01:29:44,588
It's evident
he does not know of Köpek's treachery.

751
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:50,148
Either he will find out, Artuk Bey,
or he will lose his head for it.

752
01:29:52,148 --> 01:29:53,548
You do what is necessary.

753
01:29:54,508 --> 01:29:55,868
As you wish, my bey.

754
01:30:28,845 --> 01:30:32,445
Everything's ready sir.
Günalp Bey's presents are on the horses.

755
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:33,845
Good.

756
01:30:35,685 --> 01:30:37,285
Let's not wait then.

757
01:30:37,805 --> 01:30:40,005
The sooner we have an agreement,

758
01:30:41,085 --> 01:30:44,325
the sooner we take
Söğüt and Ertuğrul's lives.

759
01:30:50,085 --> 01:30:53,645
Sir, Tekfur Ares is here.
He wants to see you.

760
01:30:56,565 --> 01:30:57,645
Let him in.

761
01:31:02,925 --> 01:31:05,485
Why is he here?

762
01:31:08,525 --> 01:31:10,285
Because he has no other place to go.

763
01:31:24,845 --> 01:31:26,565
I thought you were in Konya?

764
01:31:26,845 --> 01:31:27,685
Yes.

765
01:31:28,725 --> 01:31:29,725
I was.

766
01:31:30,325 --> 01:31:33,325
You're defeated,
at least die with your honor.

767
01:31:35,205 --> 01:31:38,285
But you've been a coward
and told the Turks everything you know.

768
01:31:39,085 --> 01:31:40,845
Don't worry, Kritos.

769
01:31:41,645 --> 01:31:44,365
My words only helped
set the Turks at odds.

770
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:46,405
And then I escaped.

771
01:31:50,045 --> 01:31:51,365
Why did you come here?

772
01:31:52,765 --> 01:31:53,765
Ertuğrul.

773
01:31:55,365 --> 01:31:57,325
I came here to finish what you started.

774
01:31:58,605 --> 01:32:01,485
He is not only my enemy,
he is an enemy of all of us.

775
01:32:02,285 --> 01:32:04,325
We can only defeat him if we unite.

776
01:32:04,805 --> 01:32:07,205
I don't need you to defeat him.

777
01:32:08,005 --> 01:32:11,565
I know Ertuğrul
and the tents most faithful to him.

778
01:32:12,365 --> 01:32:15,885
You have been defeated
even though you know him well?

779
01:32:16,445 --> 01:32:19,045
You lost the castle
that the Empire has had for so long.

780
01:32:22,285 --> 01:32:24,765
Our holy Empire
had Constantinople for ages

781
01:32:24,845 --> 01:32:27,205
and they lost it to the Latin Empire.

782
01:32:28,765 --> 01:32:31,845
But this doesn't mean we give up
and don't take it back.

783
01:32:32,285 --> 01:32:34,365
I don't want to hear it, Ares.

784
01:32:34,605 --> 01:32:36,245
I don't want you near me.

785
01:32:36,605 --> 01:32:38,205
I always win.

786
01:32:38,445 --> 01:32:40,565
I don't walk alongside losers.

787
01:32:41,285 --> 01:32:42,765
As you wish, Kritos.

788
01:32:43,805 --> 01:32:47,005
I am here
as the leader of hell warriors.

789
01:32:47,885 --> 01:32:50,205
Still, I'll fight with the Turks
without you.

790
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:52,725
But if we unite...

791
01:32:54,165 --> 01:32:55,885
then we can take

792
01:32:56,245 --> 01:32:59,245
revenge for both Karacahisar and your son.

793
01:33:13,245 --> 01:33:14,245
Fine.

794
01:33:15,765 --> 01:33:16,765
Fine.

795
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:19,805
But you'll have no authority.

796
01:33:20,525 --> 01:33:24,325
I let you fight those savages
only under my command.

797
01:33:26,285 --> 01:33:29,645
I accept anything to have my revenge
on Ertuğrul and the Turks.

798
01:33:32,285 --> 01:33:33,285
Agreed.

799
01:33:33,925 --> 01:33:38,325
Now, we're heading to
Karacahisar Castle, the one you lost.

800
01:33:38,765 --> 01:33:39,885
To Karacahisar?

801
01:33:42,925 --> 01:33:43,925
Why?

802
01:33:46,405 --> 01:33:48,205
To make peace.

803
01:33:50,605 --> 01:33:51,885
And you stay here.

804
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:55,765
Join my soldiers and begin your duty.

805
01:33:59,285 --> 01:34:00,285
Let's go.

806
01:34:30,117 --> 01:34:30,967
What is it, Dumrul?

807
01:34:31,325 --> 01:34:33,445
Bey, I followed Günalp Bey.

808
01:34:33,845 --> 01:34:36,965
First, he was after you
and now he's after Ertuğrul Bey.

809
01:34:37,485 --> 01:34:39,165
What does this man want?

810
01:34:40,445 --> 01:34:43,805
Alps! Let us go forth now!
Dumrul, you come with us too.

811
01:34:43,885 --> 01:34:45,485
As you command, bey.

812
01:36:04,485 --> 01:36:07,525
Don't you have any
political decency, Günalp Bey?

813
01:36:08,525 --> 01:36:11,165
Going after your frontiersman? Really?

814
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:13,445
Know your place, Artuk Bey.

815
01:36:14,005 --> 01:36:15,485
And stay out of it.

816
01:36:23,885 --> 01:36:26,045
Move aside or I'll ride you down.

817
01:36:26,325 --> 01:36:28,165
I won't let you go.

818
01:36:28,485 --> 01:36:32,245
Allah is infinite!

819
01:36:33,045 --> 01:36:34,525
Allah is the god!

820
01:36:44,685 --> 01:36:45,685
Günalp Bey.

821
01:36:46,405 --> 01:36:48,605
I don't know what's going on in your head,

822
01:36:48,885 --> 01:36:52,005
but if your intent is
to ambush Ertuğrul Bey,

823
01:36:52,685 --> 01:36:54,005
don't even try.

824
01:36:54,965 --> 01:36:57,885
The tracks you followed to get here

825
01:36:58,245 --> 01:37:00,005
don't belong to Ertuğrul Bey.

826
01:37:00,125 --> 01:37:01,365
Those were ours.

827
01:37:02,805 --> 01:37:04,605
These tracks will not take you to him.

828
01:37:11,885 --> 01:37:13,485
If you confront me again...

829
01:37:15,405 --> 01:37:16,805
I'll ride you down.

830
01:37:50,005 --> 01:37:51,925
Apparently, Ertuğrul's heading to Ankara.

831
01:37:52,805 --> 01:37:54,485
We have to find out why.

832
01:37:56,285 --> 01:37:58,725
Emir Sadettin is supposed to meet us
at the caravansary.

833
01:37:59,645 --> 01:38:01,885
-We're going there now.
-As you command, bey.

834
01:38:28,965 --> 01:38:30,765
We'll stop at the fork in the road.

835
01:38:35,765 --> 01:38:38,605
Kılıçarslan, it is time, my son.

836
01:38:39,045 --> 01:38:41,005
You'll escape when we stop.

837
01:38:42,765 --> 01:38:44,045
I won't leave you, mother.

838
01:38:44,205 --> 01:38:47,165
-Come with me.
-Don't worry about me, son.

839
01:38:47,795 --> 01:38:51,132
I sacrifice myself for you and our state.

840
01:38:51,885 --> 01:38:54,365
Just, don't fall into the hands
of these demons.

841
01:38:54,765 --> 01:38:56,365
I am not useful to them.

842
01:38:56,645 --> 01:38:58,085
They want your life, not mine.

843
01:38:58,165 --> 01:38:59,645
They are after you.

844
01:39:01,325 --> 01:39:05,205
I'll wait for you to be sultan
in Ankara Castle where you will save me.

845
01:39:06,365 --> 01:39:08,605
-Mother, I can't leave you.
-Kılıçarslan...

846
01:39:14,485 --> 01:39:17,845
This ring with the Oghuz insignia on it,
three arrows and a bow,

847
01:39:18,245 --> 01:39:20,765
is inherited from your ancestor
Alaeddin Kayqubad.

848
01:39:21,805 --> 01:39:22,965
This is the state ring.

849
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,645
Now it is your destiny.

850
01:39:26,445 --> 01:39:28,845
Turk tents will regard you as the state.

851
01:39:29,885 --> 01:39:31,285
You'll save this

852
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:33,885
magnificent state

853
01:39:34,205 --> 01:39:37,205
from the hands of Mahperi, Sadettin Köpek
and Altun Aba.

854
01:39:38,125 --> 01:39:39,925
You'll live for our state.

855
01:40:04,925 --> 01:40:05,925
Beys...

856
01:40:06,925 --> 01:40:09,085
From now on,

857
01:40:09,845 --> 01:40:13,725
our new home will be Söğüt,

858
01:40:14,445 --> 01:40:16,885
which Alaeddin Kayqubad granted us

859
01:40:17,405 --> 01:40:19,125
as our right.

860
01:40:20,485 --> 01:40:21,485
Therefore,

861
01:40:22,325 --> 01:40:26,205
all the tents need to start preparations.

862
01:40:28,685 --> 01:40:29,685
Hayme Hatun,

863
01:40:30,605 --> 01:40:33,765
it's not been long since we moved here
under the order of Ertuğrul Bey,

864
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:36,765
Now you're talking about emigration again.

865
01:40:38,485 --> 01:40:39,485
We understand now,

866
01:40:40,525 --> 01:40:42,845
the value of where we'd settled before.

867
01:40:51,005 --> 01:40:55,445
Ertuğrul Bey wants us to settle in Söğüt.

868
01:40:57,965 --> 01:41:02,005
This is a joint decision of Ertuğrul Bey
and Turgut Bey.

869
01:41:02,485 --> 01:41:05,485
For the peace in our tents,
emigration is necessary.

870
01:41:06,485 --> 01:41:09,005
Respect their decision.

871
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:13,365
It's the backyard of heathen Byzantine.

872
01:41:13,765 --> 01:41:15,525
They prey on us.

873
01:41:20,485 --> 01:41:22,765
Hayme Ana, Halime Hatun.

874
01:41:23,565 --> 01:41:26,445
The state doesn't stand by us anymore,
like it used to.

875
01:41:26,725 --> 01:41:28,565
You know it well.

876
01:41:30,965 --> 01:41:32,445
What are you saying, Aslıhan?

877
01:41:34,045 --> 01:41:37,285
If we go under Byzantine's noses,

878
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:40,725
they will prey on us.

879
01:41:41,045 --> 01:41:42,925
I'm afraid to be left alone

880
01:41:43,045 --> 01:41:45,445
while struggling with those heathens.

881
01:41:49,365 --> 01:41:50,445
Aslıhan Hatun...

882
01:41:51,565 --> 01:41:53,445
If we stand united...

883
01:41:54,405 --> 01:41:56,525
and listen to our beys,

884
01:41:57,085 --> 01:41:58,965
no one can shatter us.

885
01:42:03,525 --> 01:42:06,365
Ertuğrul Bey and Turgut Bey's decision

886
01:42:06,925 --> 01:42:08,445
is final.

887
01:42:09,805 --> 01:42:12,765
No need to extend the conversation.

888
01:42:15,325 --> 01:42:17,325
Preparations will start immediately.

889
01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:19,125
If anyone has...

890
01:42:20,205 --> 01:42:22,085
something to say...

891
01:42:23,085 --> 01:42:25,005
say it to Ertuğrul Bey when he is back.

892
01:43:11,405 --> 01:43:13,205
Do you need anything, Melike Hatun?

893
01:43:13,885 --> 01:43:16,445
Stay away. We don't want anything.

894
01:43:16,845 --> 01:43:19,765
-I kindly ask...
-Stay away Altun Aba.

895
01:43:19,925 --> 01:43:20,805
Back off.

896
01:43:32,885 --> 01:43:33,885
Soon, very soon.

897
01:43:35,245 --> 01:43:36,245
You just wait.

898
01:44:02,405 --> 01:44:03,405
Go to your place.

899
01:44:41,605 --> 01:44:44,085
Now, son. It is time.

900
01:44:47,765 --> 01:44:49,045
Give your blessing, Mother.

901
01:44:49,405 --> 01:44:50,605
I do, my son.

902
01:44:51,245 --> 01:44:52,645
I do, my Sultan.

903
01:44:53,885 --> 01:44:54,885
Now, go!

904
01:44:55,445 --> 01:44:56,445
Go!

905
01:45:03,365 --> 01:45:04,725
The Prince is running!

906
01:45:06,125 --> 01:45:08,845
The Prince is running!

907
01:45:10,365 --> 01:45:12,525
Run, Sultan, run!

908
01:45:12,885 --> 01:45:14,645
-Run!
-Catch him, quick!

909
01:45:17,725 --> 01:45:18,805
Catch him now!

910
01:45:19,565 --> 01:45:20,565
Let go of me!

911
01:45:22,605 --> 01:45:24,285
Kill these dogs!

912
01:45:24,565 --> 01:45:26,205
Get off! Bastards!

913
01:45:27,325 --> 01:45:28,325
Murderer!

914
01:45:28,565 --> 01:45:30,845
I said, get off!

915
01:45:32,845 --> 01:45:34,765
Catch the Prince now!

916
01:45:34,885 --> 01:45:35,725
Quick!

917
01:45:46,565 --> 01:45:49,005
Let go of me!

918
01:45:49,285 --> 01:45:50,285
Traitors!

919
01:46:31,485 --> 01:46:32,885
My brave child Günalp!

920
01:46:34,885 --> 01:46:36,085
Your Highness...

921
01:46:49,365 --> 01:46:53,405
Sultan has decided
that Ertuğrul is not guilty.

922
01:46:56,285 --> 01:46:58,005
That is unfortunate, Günalp.

923
01:47:02,645 --> 01:47:05,845
When he saw the edict
that Sultan Alaeddin sent before he died

924
01:47:06,645 --> 01:47:09,885
he didn't find the courage to stand up
to my authority in the castle.

925
01:47:10,365 --> 01:47:12,485
I settled in the castle with my soldiers.

926
01:47:13,685 --> 01:47:16,005
Well done. Wise choice.

927
01:47:17,405 --> 01:47:22,245
You could only convince Ertuğrul
with Sultan Alaeddin's edict.

928
01:47:26,365 --> 01:47:28,645
But, Your Highness,
I want to ask something.

929
01:47:32,245 --> 01:47:35,725
If Ertuğrul is that loyal
to our Sultan...

930
01:47:37,085 --> 01:47:39,085
why do we still doubt him?

931
01:47:46,485 --> 01:47:47,485
Günalp...

932
01:47:48,365 --> 01:47:52,125
Ertuğrul is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

933
01:47:53,005 --> 01:47:57,365
Don't believe his words.

934
01:47:58,725 --> 01:48:01,045
Like he deceived Sultan Alaeddin

935
01:48:01,205 --> 01:48:04,885
now he succeeds to deceive
Sultan Gıyaseddin.

936
01:48:05,725 --> 01:48:07,645
Even if he deceived our Sultan,

937
01:48:08,645 --> 01:48:12,125
how come he could deceive
His Highness Ibn Al Arabi?

938
01:48:15,045 --> 01:48:16,205
I believe that holy man

939
01:48:16,925 --> 01:48:20,685
has the power to read
the best hypocrite’s face.

940
01:48:25,205 --> 01:48:26,205
Günalp,

941
01:48:27,045 --> 01:48:30,165
do you know the reason why Ertuğrul

942
01:48:30,245 --> 01:48:32,605
rushed to Ankara?

943
01:48:34,885 --> 01:48:37,045
Because he learned that

944
01:48:37,365 --> 01:48:41,365
Prince Kılıçarslan and his mother
exiled to Ankara Castle.

945
01:48:42,285 --> 01:48:44,405
What are you saying, Your Highness?

946
01:48:45,565 --> 01:48:50,485
I think Ertuğrul is planning an uprising
against the Sultan Gıyaseddin.

947
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:54,845
I heard that

948
01:48:55,125 --> 01:48:58,725
he is in collaboration with
rebel Turkmen beys,

949
01:48:59,045 --> 01:49:03,325
even with wild Babai clans.

950
01:49:04,965 --> 01:49:06,485
How is that possible?

951
01:49:06,645 --> 01:49:08,165
Why do you think

952
01:49:08,845 --> 01:49:10,885
his brother Sungurtekin
left his tent and went?

953
01:49:12,565 --> 01:49:15,725
It is clear that he is in touch with

954
01:49:16,085 --> 01:49:21,085
disorderly Turkmen clans
in Malatya, Kefersud and Amasya.

955
01:49:22,725 --> 01:49:24,645
Not just Sungurtekin,

956
01:49:25,245 --> 01:49:27,645
brother Gündoğdu and Dündar Bey

957
01:49:27,925 --> 01:49:29,485
are also in the loop.

958
01:49:31,365 --> 01:49:32,365
Then,

959
01:49:32,925 --> 01:49:35,365
it is time to take Ertuğrul's head.

960
01:49:36,205 --> 01:49:37,405
Your Highness,

961
01:49:37,765 --> 01:49:39,805
allow me to come with you.

962
01:49:41,525 --> 01:49:44,365
I'll give you
a more important task, Günalp.

963
01:49:46,085 --> 01:49:49,365
Tekfur Kritos. He's coming to Karacahisar.

964
01:49:50,885 --> 01:49:54,685
In the name of the state I want you
to run the peace talks with him.

965
01:49:58,405 --> 01:50:00,645
My directions are in this letter.

966
01:50:07,485 --> 01:50:09,085
Strictly follow them.

967
01:50:10,685 --> 01:50:12,285
Now, go back to the castle immediately.

968
01:50:13,445 --> 01:50:15,005
Your Highness, I--

969
01:50:16,765 --> 01:50:19,245
I'll take care of Ertuğrul's head.

970
01:50:20,045 --> 01:50:24,245
Now you will fulfill this grand duty
that our state assigned to you.

971
01:50:26,325 --> 01:50:27,445
At your command.

972
01:50:29,765 --> 01:50:30,765
If you'll excuse me.

973
01:50:40,245 --> 01:50:41,245
Günalp...

974
01:50:43,565 --> 01:50:46,125
Our Sultan is about to start
this great voyage.

975
01:50:46,765 --> 01:50:50,165
I know you'll do what is needed

976
01:50:51,205 --> 01:50:53,085
considering this significant treaty.

977
01:50:57,325 --> 01:50:58,445
Don't worry.

978
01:51:14,645 --> 01:51:16,925
We found Altun Aba, Your Highness.

979
01:51:19,485 --> 01:51:22,045
We need to get there before Ertuğrul.

980
01:51:22,485 --> 01:51:23,965
We should leave right now.

981
01:51:42,685 --> 01:51:43,685
Aslıhan, daughter.

982
01:51:44,405 --> 01:51:45,405
Tell me.

983
01:51:46,085 --> 01:51:49,405
What makes you worry
about this emigration thing?

984
01:51:50,285 --> 01:51:53,765
The state is surrounded
by the lowest of the low, Hayme Ana.

985
01:51:54,445 --> 01:51:57,205
You saw what they did to Ertuğrul Bey.

986
01:51:58,125 --> 01:52:02,565
Turgut, Bamsi, Sungur Bey, Artuk Bey...

987
01:52:03,045 --> 01:52:06,085
They were almost put to death
right in front of our eyes.

988
01:52:07,205 --> 01:52:09,485
Neither the state, nor the Sultan

989
01:52:09,845 --> 01:52:11,205
stands by us.

990
01:52:13,285 --> 01:52:14,285
Aslıhan...

991
01:52:15,365 --> 01:52:17,005
There were times

992
01:52:17,165 --> 01:52:21,165
our beys overcame hardships
without our Sultan standing by us.

993
01:52:22,005 --> 01:52:27,085
Not just that, they overcame everything
with their swords and fire in their heart.

994
01:52:27,965 --> 01:52:30,285
And we do again now.

995
01:52:31,525 --> 01:52:34,245
Why do you have so little faith?

996
01:52:35,725 --> 01:52:38,005
This time is not like before, Halime.

997
01:52:38,845 --> 01:52:42,165
Emir Sadettin became very strong.

998
01:52:42,965 --> 01:52:44,285
We are strong too

999
01:52:45,045 --> 01:52:46,925
but how do we fight with everyone?

1000
01:52:49,485 --> 01:52:52,205
Daughter, this is not you speaking.

1001
01:52:53,005 --> 01:52:57,965
Being a woman, you governed
the Cavdar Tent for a long time.

1002
01:52:58,765 --> 01:53:00,645
You spoke you mind amongst the men.

1003
01:53:01,045 --> 01:53:02,765
What is the problem now?

1004
01:53:03,765 --> 01:53:05,445
Why are you so worried?

1005
01:53:06,365 --> 01:53:09,005
I'm not worried for myself.

1006
01:53:09,525 --> 01:53:11,245
I'm thinking of our tents.

1007
01:53:12,165 --> 01:53:14,925
We should not put ourselves at risk.

1008
01:53:15,365 --> 01:53:16,605
I am not a coward,

1009
01:53:17,045 --> 01:53:18,045
I'm being cautious.

1010
01:53:19,765 --> 01:53:22,445
If you think about it,
you'll see I'm right.

1011
01:53:30,285 --> 01:53:31,485
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1012
01:53:41,245 --> 01:53:42,245
Halime.

1013
01:54:22,085 --> 01:54:23,765
Traitors!

1014
01:54:23,885 --> 01:54:24,925
Leave me alone!

1015
01:54:38,485 --> 01:54:39,645
The game is over, Prince.

1016
01:54:41,885 --> 01:54:44,165
The law orders me to kill you
without bloodshed,

1017
01:54:44,285 --> 01:54:47,165
and this is my first
and last favor to you.

1018
01:54:47,445 --> 01:54:48,685
Treasonous bastards!

1019
01:54:54,205 --> 01:54:56,125
You won't get away with it!

1020
01:55:00,845 --> 01:55:02,165
I said, leave me alone!

1021
01:55:03,365 --> 01:55:04,365
Leave me alone!

1022
01:55:56,885 --> 01:55:57,885
Your father is dead!

1023
01:55:58,885 --> 01:56:00,085
Your mother will soon be dead.

1024
01:56:00,885 --> 01:56:02,565
Who will take your revenge?

1025
01:56:07,565 --> 01:56:09,365
Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah!

1026
01:56:09,685 --> 01:56:11,085
Attack!

1027
01:56:13,325 --> 01:56:15,125
Attack, my brave men!

1028
01:56:15,605 --> 01:56:18,725
Fight for the state! Save the Prince.

1029
01:56:18,885 --> 01:56:21,885
-Allah is infinite!
-Allah is infinite!

1030
01:56:22,245 --> 01:56:24,845
Allah is the god!

1031
01:59:18,765 --> 01:59:21,645
My Prince!

1032
01:59:33,005 --> 01:59:33,885
My Prince.

1033
01:59:34,085 --> 01:59:35,245
Stay strong, my Prince.

1034
01:59:35,605 --> 01:59:37,565
Hang on, we'll save you. Hang on!

1035
01:59:38,605 --> 01:59:41,125
Abdur Rahman! You take care of my Prince.

1036
01:59:41,725 --> 01:59:44,165
Look after his wound! Dress his wound!

1037
01:59:45,645 --> 01:59:48,525
Brother, we should go after
Atabey Altun Aba.

1038
01:59:48,765 --> 01:59:50,365
-As you command, bey.
-Come.

1039
02:00:43,565 --> 02:00:44,645
Artuk Bey.

1040
02:00:56,805 --> 02:00:58,805
Artuk Bey...

1041
02:01:06,405 --> 02:01:08,605
I knew you would spare me.

1042
02:01:10,805 --> 02:01:14,205
I knew you would have mercy
for the woman you married.

1043
02:01:15,565 --> 02:01:19,845
Our justice, our mercy
is for Allah, Marya.

1044
02:01:21,325 --> 02:01:24,605
We embraced you,
yet you betrayed us.

1045
02:01:25,165 --> 02:01:26,685
Stabbed us in the back.

1046
02:01:29,365 --> 02:01:31,325
You're no longer my wife, Marya.

1047
02:01:31,725 --> 02:01:32,725
I divorced you.

1048
02:01:43,165 --> 02:01:44,165
Artuk Bey.

1049
02:01:52,045 --> 02:01:55,965
Maybe, I'm carrying your child.

1050
02:01:58,725 --> 02:02:01,125
Why would you kill me
without considering this?

1051
02:02:04,605 --> 02:02:07,245
That's why you wait
in this dungeon, Marya.

1052
02:02:08,805 --> 02:02:11,605
Otherwise, I would have killed you
long ago.

1053
02:02:19,685 --> 02:02:20,685
Artuk Bey...

1054
02:02:21,685 --> 02:02:24,485
Show your kindness and forgive me, please!

1055
02:02:26,605 --> 02:02:29,045
I'm going to go mad here.

1056
02:02:29,485 --> 02:02:32,365
You should have thought before you acted.

1057
02:02:32,525 --> 02:02:34,245
You'll stay here for now.

1058
02:02:35,085 --> 02:02:37,165
The verdict will be made in due time.

1059
02:02:37,965 --> 02:02:39,165
Artuk Bey, please!

1060
02:02:39,765 --> 02:02:40,805
Artuk Bey, forgive me.

1061
02:02:42,085 --> 02:02:43,085
Please!

1062
02:02:43,525 --> 02:02:44,605
Please forgive me!

1063
02:02:45,365 --> 02:02:46,565
Please, Artuk Bey!

1064
02:02:47,085 --> 02:02:50,045
Artuk Bey, forgive me please!

1065
02:02:51,485 --> 02:02:54,805
Artuk Bey, show some mercy!

1066
02:02:55,245 --> 02:02:59,325
Artuk Bey, please, don't!

1067
02:03:00,325 --> 02:03:02,485
Forgive me, please!

1068
02:03:03,205 --> 02:03:04,485
Artuk Bey please!

1069
02:03:04,645 --> 02:03:05,765
Artuk Bey!

1070
02:03:06,045 --> 02:03:08,805
Artuk Bey, please have mercy!

1071
02:03:08,885 --> 02:03:10,445
Artuk Bey, please!

1072
02:03:11,525 --> 02:03:13,925
Please forgive me!

1073
02:03:14,005 --> 02:03:16,485
Please, Artuk Bey.

1074
02:03:17,565 --> 02:03:18,805
Please, Artuk Bey.

1075
02:04:06,845 --> 02:04:08,045
I got your son.

1076
02:04:09,565 --> 02:04:11,525
That skunk Ertuğrul appeared!

1077
02:04:11,925 --> 02:04:13,285
He couldn't save him.

1078
02:04:16,045 --> 02:04:17,045
I killed him!

1079
02:04:20,725 --> 02:04:21,725
Traitor!

1080
02:04:26,325 --> 02:04:27,565
Murderer!

1081
02:04:28,245 --> 02:04:31,525
How could you!

1082
02:04:32,845 --> 02:04:35,485
I'll kill you, too!

1083
02:04:36,405 --> 02:04:38,365
I'll kill you, too!

1084
02:04:41,365 --> 02:04:43,845
Die!

1085
02:04:47,125 --> 02:04:51,165
Die! Go with your son!

1086
02:04:52,005 --> 02:04:53,005
Die!

1087
02:05:49,085 --> 02:05:50,405
Sadettin...

1088
02:05:52,125 --> 02:05:53,605
I'm sorry to hear of what happened.

1089
02:05:55,205 --> 02:05:57,205
You came just in time, Sadettin.

1090
02:06:01,765 --> 02:06:03,645
I see you killed Melike Sultan.

1091
02:06:04,765 --> 02:06:05,645
Where is the Prince?

1092
02:06:09,165 --> 02:06:10,765
He ran into the woods.

1093
02:06:11,525 --> 02:06:12,725
I caught him.

1094
02:06:13,765 --> 02:06:15,165
I was about to strangle him,

1095
02:06:15,845 --> 02:06:17,445
Ertuğrul came to his rescue.

1096
02:06:17,805 --> 02:06:18,805
Ertuğrul?

1097
02:06:20,885 --> 02:06:22,605
Did he save the Prince?

1098
02:06:23,725 --> 02:06:25,005
He wounded me with an arrow.

1099
02:06:26,805 --> 02:06:29,325
But couldn't save the Prince
from my dagger.

1100
02:06:29,845 --> 02:06:30,845
Good.

1101
02:06:31,565 --> 02:06:32,565
Good.

1102
02:06:33,085 --> 02:06:34,805
So, the Prince is dead.

1103
02:06:36,885 --> 02:06:38,045
The Prince is dead.

1104
02:06:43,405 --> 02:06:45,245
Come. We’ll look at your wound.

1105
02:06:46,085 --> 02:06:47,085
Come.

1106
02:07:11,285 --> 02:07:15,445
This won't kill you,
but will make your life miserable.

1107
02:07:17,525 --> 02:07:19,525
It's over Sadettin.

1108
02:07:21,525 --> 02:07:22,525
The state...

1109
02:07:23,445 --> 02:07:25,045
is under our heel.

1110
02:07:26,845 --> 02:07:29,765
Now we can amend it as we wish.

1111
02:07:33,205 --> 02:07:36,165
What are you doing, Sadettin?

1112
02:07:40,485 --> 02:07:42,005
Take this arrow out!

1113
02:08:12,445 --> 02:08:15,085
We'll amend the state, Altun Aba.

1114
02:08:16,925 --> 02:08:18,445
But you won't be here.

1115
02:08:42,885 --> 02:08:46,005
This state belongs to Emir Sadettin.

1116
02:08:47,565 --> 02:08:50,965
I don't want a partner to my state
and my secret.

1117
02:09:26,965 --> 02:09:28,965
I'll ravage you one by one.

1118
02:09:32,165 --> 02:09:34,325
That's the promise of Sultan Sadettin.

1119
02:10:31,524 --> 02:10:32,604
Follow me.

1120
02:11:43,204 --> 02:11:45,884
"This is a death warrant for Altun Aba...

1121
02:11:47,164 --> 02:11:49,924
who defied Sultan Gıyaseddin's orders....

1122
02:11:50,924 --> 02:11:54,964
and killed Prince Kılıçarslan
and his mother."

1123
02:12:01,724 --> 02:12:03,924
Emir Sadettin Köpek.

1124
02:12:07,244 --> 02:12:08,364
Why would he do that?

1125
02:12:09,804 --> 02:12:13,684
That bastard wants to save himself
from the consequences of his crimes.

1126
02:12:15,604 --> 02:12:17,084
Not only that, Turgut.

1127
02:12:18,404 --> 02:12:20,204
He kills his enemies one by one.

1128
02:12:21,724 --> 02:12:22,724
Now, it is...

1129
02:12:23,684 --> 02:12:26,124
Sultan Gıyaseddin and his mother's turn.

1130
02:12:27,684 --> 02:12:29,924
Bey, what does this bastard want?

1131
02:12:30,924 --> 02:12:35,444
What is he planning by killing the state's
sultans and princes one by one?

1132
02:12:35,804 --> 02:12:36,804
It looks like...

1133
02:12:38,404 --> 02:12:39,404
he wants to be...

1134
02:12:40,324 --> 02:12:41,564
the new sultan.

1135
02:12:43,884 --> 02:12:46,644
If we can't stop this,
no one can, Bamsi.

1136
02:13:26,364 --> 02:13:27,364
Mother.

1137
02:13:28,244 --> 02:13:30,564
I am worrying about Aslıhan.

1138
02:13:32,644 --> 02:13:35,404
I hope her being anxious about
migrating to Söğüt

1139
02:13:35,964 --> 02:13:38,724
won't cause any dispute
between the tribes.

1140
02:13:42,404 --> 02:13:43,404
My dear.

1141
02:13:43,964 --> 02:13:47,404
Aslıhan has made a lot of sacrifices
for her tribe.

1142
02:13:48,524 --> 02:13:50,844
She didn't let anybody
take her tribe from her.

1143
02:13:51,724 --> 02:13:53,964
Now she worries for us
to get in a quandary

1144
02:13:54,564 --> 02:13:56,684
at Söğüt, because of Emir Sadettin.

1145
02:13:57,604 --> 02:14:01,924
And she is right about that.
But she is exaggerating.

1146
02:14:09,204 --> 02:14:11,804
Mother, I know she has been through a lot.

1147
02:14:13,324 --> 02:14:15,884
That traitor Emir Sadettin
did very bad things to her.

1148
02:14:17,124 --> 02:14:20,724
They have been poisoned,
and Turgut almost got hanged.

1149
02:14:25,204 --> 02:14:27,804
Aslıhan has every right to worry.

1150
02:14:29,724 --> 02:14:30,924
You are right, my dear.

1151
02:14:32,524 --> 02:14:35,684
But we are not here just to sleep
in the tent.

1152
02:14:36,884 --> 02:14:38,164
We have a duty.

1153
02:14:38,844 --> 02:14:40,164
We have a mission.

1154
02:14:40,924 --> 02:14:43,524
And there is no place for fear
on this road.

1155
02:14:44,324 --> 02:14:47,884
We have strengthened our tribes
by uniting them.

1156
02:14:49,004 --> 02:14:52,404
We can't give up now
because of Emir Sadettin.

1157
02:14:54,684 --> 02:14:56,404
You should talk to her.

1158
02:14:56,964 --> 02:14:58,604
You should relieve her.

1159
02:14:59,684 --> 02:15:00,724
She should know that

1160
02:15:01,364 --> 02:15:04,284
this road is not for those who fear
new starts.

1161
02:15:05,524 --> 02:15:06,524
This road...

1162
02:15:07,284 --> 02:15:08,364
is for those...

1163
02:15:09,044 --> 02:15:11,324
who can run through fire with a sword.

1164
02:15:32,124 --> 02:15:33,204
Shahzade.

1165
02:15:35,164 --> 02:15:36,164
Shahzade.

1166
02:15:36,444 --> 02:15:37,484
Shahzade, wake up.

1167
02:15:37,964 --> 02:15:40,404
Hang on. How is he?

1168
02:15:40,644 --> 02:15:44,284
-The prince is badly hurt, Bey.
-Ertuğrul Bey.

1169
02:15:45,484 --> 02:15:46,524
Hang on, Prince.

1170
02:15:47,004 --> 02:15:48,004
You will live.

1171
02:15:48,604 --> 02:15:49,964
You will become Sultan.

1172
02:15:56,604 --> 02:15:57,684
This...

1173
02:15:59,324 --> 02:16:02,164
is an heirloom from my ancestor
Alaeddin Kayqubad.

1174
02:16:03,884 --> 02:16:04,924
It is a state ring.

1175
02:16:09,724 --> 02:16:12,284
They've killed my father, and me.

1176
02:16:15,324 --> 02:16:19,364
All the Turk tribes should gather
around someone worthy.

1177
02:16:21,844 --> 02:16:24,284
Someone worthy should wear the state ring.

1178
02:16:40,244 --> 02:16:41,764
Prince!

1179
02:17:25,404 --> 02:17:27,244
Send the prince's body
to the palace, Turgut.

1180
02:17:29,004 --> 02:17:31,844
Let Sultan Gıyaseddin see
what they did to his brother.

1181
02:17:34,964 --> 02:17:36,284
Many princes...

1182
02:17:37,284 --> 02:17:40,164
have been tragically killed
in the struggle for power.

1183
02:17:41,644 --> 02:17:42,924
How could they do this?

1184
02:17:44,324 --> 02:17:46,484
They have killed this young prince, Bey.

1185
02:17:48,884 --> 02:17:50,404
What kind of state is this?

1186
02:17:56,404 --> 02:17:58,804
They also broke
our millennia-old traditions.

1187
02:18:02,124 --> 02:18:03,924
They've killed a member of the dynasty.

1188
02:18:05,204 --> 02:18:06,964
This means bad luck for the state.

1189
02:18:15,124 --> 02:18:16,164
For me,

1190
02:18:17,484 --> 02:18:18,484
the state...

1191
02:18:19,284 --> 02:18:20,284
is over now.

1192
02:18:26,404 --> 02:18:27,404
Come on.

1193
02:18:28,724 --> 02:18:29,764
Lift the prince.

1194
02:18:53,204 --> 02:18:55,644
This is not only a prince's body,

1195
02:18:56,844 --> 02:18:59,724
but also the massacred future
of a mighty state.

1196
02:19:17,964 --> 02:19:19,284
-Artuk Bey.
-What is it?

1197
02:19:19,364 --> 02:19:21,284
The governor of Bilecik is here to visit.

1198
02:19:21,484 --> 02:19:22,604
He is talking to Günalp Bey.

1199
02:19:22,684 --> 02:19:23,724
The governor of Bilecik?

1200
02:19:24,084 --> 02:19:25,404
What is he doing here?

1201
02:19:25,924 --> 02:19:27,724
What is he talking to Günalp Bey about?

1202
02:19:29,444 --> 02:19:31,364
What are they planning to do?

1203
02:20:09,804 --> 02:20:11,244
<i>Bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

1204
02:20:24,764 --> 02:20:25,764
Bey.

1205
02:20:28,044 --> 02:20:29,244
You look so tired.

1206
02:20:30,204 --> 02:20:31,564
I made some ayran for you.

1207
02:20:32,044 --> 02:20:33,044
Drink.

1208
02:20:39,604 --> 02:20:40,844
Thank you, Aslıhan.

1209
02:20:47,044 --> 02:20:48,484
<i>Bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

1210
02:21:02,764 --> 02:21:03,764
Turgut.

1211
02:21:05,284 --> 02:21:06,884
We've just settled with the Kayi.

1212
02:21:07,604 --> 02:21:10,644
It took us a very long time
to organize things here.

1213
02:21:11,484 --> 02:21:13,564
I say let's discuss it with the bey,

1214
02:21:14,124 --> 02:21:15,644
and talk him out of the migration.

1215
02:21:24,484 --> 02:21:25,484
Aslıhan.

1216
02:21:26,444 --> 02:21:27,844
We have talked about this.

1217
02:21:29,124 --> 02:21:30,244
Do not try anymore.

1218
02:21:32,564 --> 02:21:33,684
Let's drop the subject.

1219
02:21:34,724 --> 02:21:37,364
I am considering what's best
for our tribe.

1220
02:21:37,804 --> 02:21:38,884
Why don't you understand?

1221
02:21:39,284 --> 02:21:42,204
Now that the sultan is dead,
Ertuğrul Bey is all alone.

1222
02:21:42,484 --> 02:21:44,564
Emir Sadettin has power now.

1223
02:21:44,884 --> 02:21:46,364
How can we deal with him?

1224
02:21:50,004 --> 02:21:52,804
And do you think it is over
when you say let's drop the subject?

1225
02:21:52,884 --> 02:21:53,884
Aslıhan!

1226
02:21:56,604 --> 02:21:57,604
Know your place.

1227
02:21:59,124 --> 02:22:01,284
How many more times
will I explain it to you?

1228
02:22:01,444 --> 02:22:02,444
Turgut.

1229
02:22:02,604 --> 02:22:04,284
We have peace here, in our tribe.

1230
02:22:04,764 --> 02:22:06,684
Everything in the garden is rosy here.

1231
02:22:07,084 --> 02:22:09,924
We will always be sitting
on a powder keg in Söğüt.

1232
02:22:10,484 --> 02:22:12,084
Why don't you understand?

1233
02:22:14,324 --> 02:22:16,404
I have also discussed it with our beys.

1234
02:22:16,764 --> 02:22:19,204
They are not leaning toward
migrating to Söğüt.

1235
02:22:26,964 --> 02:22:28,924
Aslıhan, haven't I told you...

1236
02:22:30,244 --> 02:22:33,084
that you are not to discuss tribe politics
with the beys?

1237
02:22:33,484 --> 02:22:35,044
Why are not listening to me?

1238
02:22:35,764 --> 02:22:38,244
It is not your job
to discuss it with the beys.

1239
02:22:39,044 --> 02:22:40,044
Turgut.

1240
02:22:40,324 --> 02:22:42,404
I was the bey of this tribe once.

1241
02:22:42,724 --> 02:22:47,764
I respect you because you are my husband,
however, there is a line here.

1242
02:22:48,444 --> 02:22:50,964
And you've crossed the line.

1243
02:23:03,044 --> 02:23:04,244
Enough is enough, Aslıhan.

1244
02:23:07,484 --> 02:23:08,684
Enough is enough.

1245
02:23:11,244 --> 02:23:12,244
Turgut.

1246
02:23:13,564 --> 02:23:14,844
Why don't you understand?

1247
02:23:15,484 --> 02:23:19,324
Emir Sadettin will not stop
bothering you and Ertuğrul Bey.

1248
02:23:20,684 --> 02:23:22,244
I am trying to protect you.

1249
02:23:31,324 --> 02:23:32,844
You are saying it's your tribe.

1250
02:23:34,884 --> 02:23:36,404
It is my tribe too.

1251
02:23:37,724 --> 02:23:40,524
I would be the one who protects it,
if necessary!

1252
02:23:43,644 --> 02:23:44,964
It is not your duty

1253
02:23:45,084 --> 02:23:48,684
to protect us from that bastard
Emir Sadettin's attacks!

1254
02:23:55,084 --> 02:23:57,324
You are the one who needs to know
her place.

1255
02:24:00,324 --> 02:24:02,284
This conversation is over.

1256
02:24:19,644 --> 02:24:21,884
Thank you for your gifts, Governor Kritos.

1257
02:24:22,884 --> 02:24:27,404
You are welcome. This is just
a small token for the peace treaty.

1258
02:24:29,764 --> 02:24:31,804
Now, let's talk about the treaty.

1259
02:24:42,604 --> 02:24:44,244
What is this impertinence, Artuk Bey?

1260
02:24:44,964 --> 02:24:48,964
-You should ask for permission first.
-No, you should ask for permission first.

1261
02:24:50,004 --> 02:24:51,204
You are not Ertuğrul Bey.

1262
02:24:51,444 --> 02:24:54,044
What is it with you negotiating
with the governor of Bilecik?

1263
02:24:56,284 --> 02:24:57,284
What is this?

1264
02:24:58,124 --> 02:25:00,964
This is the peace treaty we will sign
by the order of the state.

1265
02:25:02,604 --> 02:25:06,204
They wanted me to discuss the peace
and sign the treaty.

1266
02:25:06,924 --> 02:25:08,044
What peace is this?

1267
02:25:09,244 --> 02:25:12,844
To stop this uncertainty about Söğüt
between the two states.

1268
02:25:13,764 --> 02:25:15,204
-So?
-So...

1269
02:25:16,244 --> 02:25:17,804
Söğüt will be left to us,

1270
02:25:18,924 --> 02:25:21,604
and there will be peace in this land.

1271
02:25:22,124 --> 02:25:23,244
Is that right?

1272
02:25:23,884 --> 02:25:25,364
-Right.
-Wrong.

1273
02:25:28,164 --> 02:25:33,404
Söğüt and Domaniç were given
to Ertuğrul Bey by decree

1274
02:25:33,604 --> 02:25:35,284
of the late Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad.

1275
02:25:37,124 --> 02:25:38,484
You cannot defy the decree.

1276
02:25:40,684 --> 02:25:42,444
That's our state's new order, Artuk Bey.

1277
02:25:43,404 --> 02:25:47,004
With this new order, Sultan Alaeddin's
decree is repealed.

1278
02:25:47,124 --> 02:25:48,484
-It can't be.
-Artuk Bey!

1279
02:25:48,564 --> 02:25:52,164
Ertuğrul Bey has the last word on this.

1280
02:25:52,444 --> 02:25:55,044
You can only sign this treaty
with his permission.

1281
02:25:55,244 --> 02:25:58,404
Without Ertuğrul Bey's permission,
it is null and void.

1282
02:26:00,204 --> 02:26:04,844
Has Ertuğrul Bey become the new
Seljuk Sultan, Günalp Bey?

1283
02:26:07,204 --> 02:26:08,204
Rest assured.

1284
02:26:09,004 --> 02:26:10,444
We will do our state's orders.

1285
02:26:12,644 --> 02:26:14,444
Provided that you pay your taxes,

1286
02:26:15,324 --> 02:26:18,204
Söğüt will be in your possession.

1287
02:26:19,244 --> 02:26:20,244
Look, Günalp Bey.

1288
02:26:21,484 --> 02:26:24,084
We know that you are giving us Söğüt

1289
02:26:24,684 --> 02:26:28,564
for the safety of your western borders
when you are on a crusade.

1290
02:26:29,284 --> 02:26:32,964
I trusted your word and came here
with good intentions.

1291
02:26:33,684 --> 02:26:35,804
I want to sign this treaty, too.

1292
02:26:37,244 --> 02:26:39,724
But if this will cause problems...

1293
02:26:42,244 --> 02:26:45,764
We cannot have that peace
at your borders.

1294
02:26:46,084 --> 02:26:48,844
Are you threatening us, Governor?

1295
02:26:49,764 --> 02:26:53,124
Who are you to talk to me like that?

1296
02:26:55,244 --> 02:26:58,204
Günalp Bey, who is in charge here?

1297
02:27:02,044 --> 02:27:04,564
The treaty will be signed.

1298
02:27:06,844 --> 02:27:08,404
What about Ertuğrul Bey?

1299
02:27:11,124 --> 02:27:12,804
Since his man is speaking like this,

1300
02:27:12,884 --> 02:27:16,764
he will do whatever he can
to break the treaty.

1301
02:27:17,244 --> 02:27:20,284
Do you guarantee that Ertuğrul Bey
will stand idle?

1302
02:27:20,444 --> 02:27:21,444
Rest assured.

1303
02:27:22,004 --> 02:27:23,804
Our state guarantees you everything.

1304
02:27:25,844 --> 02:27:28,764
His Eminence Emir Sadettin places
importance on this treaty.

1305
02:27:31,244 --> 02:27:32,444
He gave the order himself.

1306
02:27:34,804 --> 02:27:36,044
This treaty will be signed.

1307
02:27:38,884 --> 02:27:40,604
And no one will break this.

1308
02:27:44,444 --> 02:27:45,524
It won't be signed!

1309
02:27:53,204 --> 02:27:56,164
No one can do that,

1310
02:27:56,764 --> 02:27:58,444
let alone Emir Sadettin.

1311
02:28:03,244 --> 02:28:05,924
Söğüt was given to Ertuğrul Bey.

1312
02:28:06,684 --> 02:28:09,244
The sultan's decree is still valid,
even though he is dead.

1313
02:28:10,524 --> 02:28:14,364
But if you still want to sign that treaty,

1314
02:28:15,044 --> 02:28:17,564
then you need to kill all of us first.

1315
02:28:37,844 --> 02:28:40,724
Now, I am giving you an order.

1316
02:28:41,164 --> 02:28:44,604
<i>Your Eminence Sultan Gıyaseddin,</i>
<i>may I come in?</i>

1317
02:28:45,804 --> 02:28:46,804
Come in.

1318
02:30:54,484 --> 02:30:55,484
Who did this?

1319
02:30:56,484 --> 02:30:58,164
Sultan, we don't know.

1320
02:30:59,484 --> 02:31:01,764
But his body was brought
by Ertuğrul Bey's alps.

1321
02:31:04,284 --> 02:31:05,444
What are you saying?

1322
02:31:05,964 --> 02:31:10,244
Ertuğrul Bey also sent you a letter
with one of his alps.

1323
02:31:28,364 --> 02:31:31,244
<i>"First, our state was betrayed.</i>

1324
02:31:31,564 --> 02:31:35,364
<i>And now, it is stained with the blood</i>
<i>of the prince.</i>

1325
02:31:35,644 --> 02:31:37,524
<i>Everything is rotting, Sultan.</i>

1326
02:31:39,724 --> 02:31:42,124
<i>You should stop all of this."</i>

1327
02:31:59,244 --> 02:32:00,244
Mother.

1328
02:32:05,164 --> 02:32:08,284
It was the best for our state, Sultan.

1329
02:32:11,324 --> 02:32:12,844
May God forgive his sins.

1330
02:32:13,684 --> 02:32:14,804
May he rest in peace.

1331
02:32:21,244 --> 02:32:22,244
Soldiers.

1332
02:32:24,524 --> 02:32:26,004
Take my mother to her room.

1333
02:32:27,044 --> 02:32:30,524
She will not leave without my permission.
She will be secluded.

1334
02:32:33,244 --> 02:32:35,404
Do you hear what you are saying, Sultan?

1335
02:32:36,324 --> 02:32:38,604
I hear it, Mother. I hear it very well.

1336
02:32:40,844 --> 02:32:42,124
Let's go, Mahperi Hatun.

1337
02:32:45,644 --> 02:32:48,244
Do you think being a sultan
at such a young age

1338
02:32:48,884 --> 02:32:51,124
will save you from your enemy, Sultan?

1339
02:32:54,124 --> 02:32:55,124
Don't do this.

1340
02:32:59,404 --> 02:33:00,404
Take her!

1341
02:34:17,484 --> 02:34:20,164
-Ertuğrul Bey.
-What is happening, Günalp Bey?

1342
02:34:21,164 --> 02:34:24,124
You are signing a peace treaty
without letting me know.

1343
02:34:25,524 --> 02:34:26,724
And...

1344
02:34:27,044 --> 02:34:29,564
with the bastard that you said
you would trample down.

1345
02:34:30,124 --> 02:34:32,484
How dare you insult me, Ertuğrul Bey?

1346
02:34:34,044 --> 02:34:37,204
We will sign the peace treaty
with our state's order.

1347
02:34:39,204 --> 02:34:40,764
Provided that they pay their taxes,

1348
02:34:41,124 --> 02:34:45,244
Söğüt will be in the possession
of Kritos, the governor of Bilecik.

1349
02:34:47,884 --> 02:34:50,004
This conversation is over, Ertuğrul Bey.

1350
02:34:52,844 --> 02:34:57,604
Söğüt was given to me by decree
of Sultan Alaeddin.

1351
02:35:00,404 --> 02:35:04,644
No one can take it from me...

1352
02:35:06,444 --> 02:35:08,604
without shedding my blood
and that of the Kayi.

1353
02:35:13,284 --> 02:35:14,684
Who is the state, Günalp Bey?

1354
02:35:15,924 --> 02:35:18,844
Is it Sultan Gıyaseddin or Ertuğrul Bey?

1355
02:35:21,964 --> 02:35:25,244
If the margrave doesn't follow
the state's orders,

1356
02:35:26,284 --> 02:35:27,924
it is my duty to solve this.

1357
02:35:31,924 --> 02:35:32,924
Ertuğrul Bey.

1358
02:35:33,884 --> 02:35:35,764
Hereafter, your words don't have
any power.

1359
02:35:38,804 --> 02:35:39,804
Now,

1360
02:35:40,644 --> 02:35:42,124
this treaty will be signed.

1361
02:36:07,524 --> 02:36:11,844
I am... the state here!

1362
02:36:17,484 --> 02:36:19,124
If you want to take Söğüt,

1363
02:36:20,324 --> 02:36:22,084
come and take it from me.

1364
02:36:30,844 --> 02:36:32,244
That's enough, Günalp Bey.

1365
02:36:33,444 --> 02:36:36,004
I came here with your invitation,
to reach an agreement.

1366
02:36:36,204 --> 02:36:39,084
But I can see that you can't even
reach an agreement between yourselves.

1367
02:36:40,484 --> 02:36:41,844
You are not going anywhere!

1368
02:36:49,404 --> 02:36:50,844
What do you think you are doing?

1369
02:36:51,884 --> 02:36:54,804
Did you invite me to trap me?

1370
02:36:57,644 --> 02:36:58,844
Are you going to kill me

1371
02:36:59,564 --> 02:37:01,684
like you killed my son, Ertuğrul Bey?

1372
02:37:03,124 --> 02:37:06,084
Our emperor will make you pay for this.

1373
02:37:07,564 --> 02:37:09,524
What do you think you are doing,
Ertuğrul Bey?

1374
02:37:10,364 --> 02:37:12,924
The governor came here
with the invitation of our state.

1375
02:37:13,484 --> 02:37:15,284
The governor is our guest.

1376
02:37:20,124 --> 02:37:24,364
This man set a trap for us with Ares.

1377
02:37:28,524 --> 02:37:31,284
He put his soldiers under Titan's orders
and killed my alps.

1378
02:37:32,844 --> 02:37:35,204
He aided and abetted the kidnappers
of my child.

1379
02:37:36,364 --> 02:37:37,364
And...

1380
02:37:37,884 --> 02:37:41,444
he kidnapped our women
and tried to set a trap for us.

1381
02:37:45,724 --> 02:37:49,084
And now, he is trying to take Söğüt...

1382
02:37:51,124 --> 02:37:52,644
with the help of the palace crew.

1383
02:37:54,644 --> 02:37:56,204
I will cut his body in half...

1384
02:37:57,204 --> 02:37:58,764
in the middle of the village.

1385
02:38:02,724 --> 02:38:03,724
And then,

1386
02:38:04,604 --> 02:38:06,244
I will go to Söğüt with my alps...

1387
02:38:07,324 --> 02:38:08,564
and find a location.

1388
02:38:12,404 --> 02:38:13,404
And then,

1389
02:38:14,884 --> 02:38:18,924
the Cavdar and Kayi tribes
will migrate to Söğüt.

1390
02:38:19,964 --> 02:38:22,164
I won't let you do that, Ertuğrul Bey!

1391
02:38:26,644 --> 02:38:28,484
I said that if you tried
to break me,

1392
02:38:29,724 --> 02:38:31,284
I would crush you.

1393
02:38:34,124 --> 02:38:35,124
How dare you?

1394
02:38:38,284 --> 02:38:40,364
You had me followed secretly.

1395
02:38:41,684 --> 02:38:42,684
And then,

1396
02:38:43,124 --> 02:38:45,844
you tried to sign a peace treaty
without letting me know.

1397
02:38:47,084 --> 02:38:49,564
You and the palace crew
made a gift of the lands

1398
02:38:49,844 --> 02:38:52,364
that Sultan Alaeddin gave me.

1399
02:38:53,764 --> 02:38:55,804
Until you learn to obey me,

1400
02:38:56,604 --> 02:38:58,404
you will be locked in the dungeon.

1401
02:39:13,724 --> 02:39:17,484
I... promised you that I would obey you.

1402
02:39:18,604 --> 02:39:22,644
And now, I will obey you
and willingly go to the dungeon.

1403
02:39:29,124 --> 02:39:30,124
However,

1404
02:39:31,044 --> 02:39:34,004
I was here to sign the treaty
under the state's orders.

1405
02:39:36,604 --> 02:39:39,564
The state will make you pay for this.

1406
02:39:44,764 --> 02:39:46,164
You have started a war.

1407
02:39:48,044 --> 02:39:49,924
Söğüt will be stained with your blood.

1408
02:39:51,324 --> 02:39:52,364
Lucky me.

1409
02:39:53,444 --> 02:39:56,564
I can clearly see that my enemies
are united against me.

1410
02:40:01,964 --> 02:40:02,964
Now,

1411
02:40:04,284 --> 02:40:05,324
it is time for war.

1412
02:40:05,844 --> 02:40:07,284
<i>Great God!</i>

1413
02:40:15,044 --> 02:40:16,644
Get him out of my castle.

1414
02:41:00,633 --> 02:41:31,500
