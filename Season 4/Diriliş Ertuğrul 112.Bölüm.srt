1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Episode 112 will start after 12:05 min.

2
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,260
The corpses have been gathered.

3
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,940
Taceddin Kayraldi.

4
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,940
Find that traitor and bring him to me.

5
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,380
His wife's brother works for us.
He's there now. It's not far.

6
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,580
I'll be back with him soon.

7
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,500
Good. Reach out to Günalp Bey.
Tell him to come here.

8
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,820
I have an important mission for him.

9
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,060
As you command, Eminence.

10
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,860
You've escaped a deadly plot, Sadettin.

11
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,460
And you saved me from a dagger.

12
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,660
You fought with me against my enemies.

13
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,020
You're welcome.

14
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,820
As I said, I came here
to make a deal with you.

15
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,740
Not a deal with Governor Kritos,
but one with you.

16
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,980
Stay with Governor Kritos.

17
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,420
When the time comes, I'll help you
and give you back your title.

18
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,460
But first, we must finish off
Ertuğrul and the Kayis.

19
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,380
Your reputation and vengeance...

20
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,180
along with my dynasty,
will rise above Ertuğrul's blood.

21
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,820
Ertuğrul's blood? Deal.

22
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,860
From now on, your bey is nothing.

23
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,020
Neither are you!

24
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,540
His rage has cost him his title.

25
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,580
Tomorrow I take back Söğüt.

26
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,220
You little--

27
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
Stop!

28
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,780
What are you doing?

29
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,420
Where will violence get you?

30
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,260
I'll show you violence!

31
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,260
Bamsi!

32
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,420
You'll be held accountable
for this, Aydoğmus.

33
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,580
Your bey is no longer the frontier bey.

34
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
Know your place.

35
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,180
Otherwise, we won't let you live.

36
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,540
Soldiers! Untie Governor Kritos.

37
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,300
Our frontier bey, Günalp Bey,
will see him in his chamber.

38
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:35,906
Now I have to let Governor Kritos go
so he can sign the peace agreement.

39
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:38,306
That is what the state commands.

40
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:46,346
Ertuğrul Bey?

41
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:51,826
I had no idea the Sultan
was going to issue this decree.

42
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:56,066
Nor do I know why he's done it.

43
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:04,866
But that is what the state commands.
I have to abide by it.

44
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,866
As much as I know
your intentions are pure...

45
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:20,386
I also know that Emir Sadettin has drawn
a veil across your eyes, Günalp Bey.

46
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,226
Ertuğrul Bey.

47
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:27,426
I knew that this would happen
sooner or later, Günalp Bey.

48
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:34,586
Emir Sadettin,
through one mischief or another,

49
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,506
has forced our Sultan
into signing this decree.

50
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:38,786
Don't, Ertuğrul Bey.

51
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:43,066
You don't know Emir Sadettin.

52
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,706
You don't know
what he's done for the state.

53
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:50,226
He has stood beside our Sultan
through many a battle.

54
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:53,786
I know his heart best, Günalp Bey.

55
00:18:55,906 --> 00:19:00,426
Sadettin is not for the good of the state,
the state is for the good of Sadettin.

56
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:04,266
Choose your side.

57
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:11,706
I earned the right to this castle
and the frontier bey title with my sword.

58
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,466
I surrender them to you now
in the name of my state

59
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:19,066
so that blood need not be shed.

60
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,386
I am consoled by the fact

61
00:19:23,186 --> 00:19:25,626
that I surrender it
to a valiant castle commander

62
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,986
who will defend Karacahisar
until his last breath.

63
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:32,266
Thank you.

64
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:35,826
I will go to Söğüt with my tribe.

65
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:43,586
But that dog, Governor Kritos,
will not leave you be there.

66
00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:49,586
We have no fear of anyone, thank God.

67
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:53,306
Keep your eyes open.

68
00:19:55,346 --> 00:20:00,026
Emir Sadettin has taken control
of the state. Don’t fall for his tricks.

69
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:04,186
He has no loyalties, Günalp Bey.

70
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:11,786
Just as he did for our Sultan,
if you should someday stand in his way...

71
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:16,266
know that he won't hesitate
to destroy you too.

72
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:23,906
May God be with you and aid you.

73
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:29,306
Ertuğrul Bey.

74
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:34,946
If the day comes when you find yourself
in a bad situation in Söğüt...

75
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,746
know that you have a friend
at Karacahisar Castle.

76
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:44,226
Thank you.

77
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:38,946
If Ertuğrul manages to evade Kritos' trap

78
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,986
it'll leave him even angrier
with you and him.

79
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:45,306
There's nothing he can do.

80
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:50,146
I relieved him of the title
of frontier bey with the Sultan's decree.

81
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:51,946
What?

82
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:54,626
How?

83
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:58,786
How did you persuade
the Sultan to do that?

84
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:06,026
It is useful to know when to use the power
at your disposal.

85
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:11,706
I persuaded him with that power.

86
00:22:13,546 --> 00:22:14,706
However...

87
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:18,946
he gave Söğüt to Ertuğrul
so that he can settle there.

88
00:22:23,546 --> 00:22:25,426
You isolated Ertuğrul.

89
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:30,266
You left him alone
with Governor Kritos at Söğüt.

90
00:22:31,546 --> 00:22:35,546
With Governor Kritos
and with you, Ares, right?

91
00:22:38,946 --> 00:22:41,146
I've laid Ertuğrul out before you.

92
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:45,386
Now it's your turn. Finish him off.

93
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:50,986
You will be the one
who profits most out of this, Ares.

94
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:55,226
Kill Ertuğrul, and be governor once again.

95
00:22:56,946 --> 00:23:01,306
Not even becoming emperor could compare
to getting revenge on Ertuğrul.

96
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:05,106
Don't worry about Ertuğrul.

97
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:10,026
Leave him to me. I'll deal with him.

98
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:15,346
But now I have to get back to Bilecik.

99
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:26,906
I will expect good news from you, Ares.

100
00:24:20,146 --> 00:24:22,226
My bey. My bey.

101
00:24:25,026 --> 00:24:26,066
My bey.

102
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,986
Are we to leave the castle
that we conquered, just like that, my bey?

103
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:40,866
This is not the time for us to rise up,

104
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:43,786
even if what has befallen us
is a great injustice, Bamsi.

105
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:48,226
Justice has yet to be served.

106
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:05,106
Sadettin Köpek has gotten what he wanted
by forcing our Sultan into a tight spot.

107
00:25:06,146 --> 00:25:07,826
The situation our Sultan
finds himself in...

108
00:25:08,346 --> 00:25:12,626
shows that our state
is at greater risk than I had thought.

109
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:19,586
Know that this is my most important
command to you as your bey.

110
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:25,746
It's not only our duty to defend
our castle and our tribe...

111
00:25:26,946 --> 00:25:30,066
but every land which makes up our state.

112
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:34,066
Wherever a fire might burn
in our homeland...

113
00:25:35,146 --> 00:25:36,546
we will be there.

114
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,506
Let Günalp Bey be the frontier bey.

115
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:50,746
But the castle in which he is to remain
will be forever protected by our lineage.

116
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:56,346
We will not forget the blood
of our martyr's in its soil.

117
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:03,506
Our glorious banner
will always fly over Karacahisar.

118
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:08,026
-As you say, my bey.
-As you say, my bey.

119
00:26:09,586 --> 00:26:12,386
May God never take you from us, my bey.

120
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:15,106
-Amen.
-Thank you, Artuk Bey.

121
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:17,706
You've made a sound decision, my bey.

122
00:26:18,546 --> 00:26:22,586
There would have been
no stopping the bloodshed otherwise.

123
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:27,986
Now...

124
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:35,466
it's time we saw
our banner flying over Söğüt.

125
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,066
We know what Köpek's intentions are.

126
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:49,266
He knows I won't leave Söğüt.

127
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,986
He wants to feed us to Kritos.

128
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:56,586
We'll send that jackal
to lie next to his son, my bey.

129
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:03,146
Thank you, Bamsi.
I have no doubt you will.

130
00:27:04,946 --> 00:27:07,346
We'll let them think
they've turned us into bait.

131
00:27:09,026 --> 00:27:10,866
We'll be the ones doing the hunting.

132
00:27:15,106 --> 00:27:16,106
Next...

133
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:20,026
we light a fire in Söğüt.

134
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:24,226
The Turk tribes, the Turk beys...

135
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:27,026
will come together around that fire.

136
00:27:30,186 --> 00:27:32,266
We have but one other mission.

137
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:43,066
We're going to kill Emir Sadettin.

138
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:01,186
You summoned me, my bey.

139
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:06,106
Gunkut,

140
00:28:08,306 --> 00:28:10,706
get this letter to our Sultan right away.

141
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,466
This isn't just a letter
I'm entrusting to you.

142
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:22,466
It is the honor of the Kayi tribe
and our state.

143
00:28:24,626 --> 00:28:29,626
This letter is to be read by no one
but the Sultan, understand?

144
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,106
As you command, my bey.

145
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:34,946
Show me what you're made of.

146
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:41,026
Come on, men.

147
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,346
Door.

148
00:29:12,706 --> 00:29:13,786
Door.

149
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:33,546
I'm begging you,
please let me out of here.

150
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:36,866
You'll get out.

151
00:29:38,066 --> 00:29:42,546
They were cruel to you.
But Emir Sadettin showed you mercy.

152
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:46,066
You know who it is
you should work for, right?

153
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,386
I will show Artuk Bey.

154
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:55,466
They will all suffer at my hands.

155
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,786
Good.

156
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:03,906
-I have your first task.
-I'll do whatever you want.

157
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:06,986
You will go to Governor Kritos at Bilecik.

158
00:30:07,946 --> 00:30:10,346
We want to know everything
that goes on there.

159
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:14,546
It would be my pleasure.
I'm indebted to you.

160
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,026
Don't doubt
that I will pay you back in full.

161
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:21,546
If you try to escape,

162
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:25,146
know that you will suffer
the full force of Emir Sadettin's fury.

163
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:28,746
You can be sure that I will do my duty.

164
00:30:30,106 --> 00:30:31,426
Very good.

165
00:30:33,346 --> 00:30:34,786
We will await news from you.

166
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:40,346
Leave without being seen once Ertuğrul
and his alps have left the castle.

167
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:55,186
God!

168
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:07,306
My bey.

169
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:11,546
Is what they're saying true?

170
00:31:19,106 --> 00:31:20,386
My alps.

171
00:31:21,706 --> 00:31:24,786
The castle that we took
with the blood of many martyrs,

172
00:31:25,706 --> 00:31:28,146
we now entrust back to the state.

173
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:44,746
No one should despair over this.

174
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:50,066
No one should blame
the state nor feel anger towards it.

175
00:31:52,546 --> 00:31:56,666
We conquered this castle for our state

176
00:31:57,066 --> 00:31:59,546
and we surrender it to the state.

177
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:06,146
Our arms are strong, our swords are sharp.

178
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:12,706
Our swords will
be raised yet again in battle

179
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:15,706
and conquer other castles.

180
00:32:15,906 --> 00:32:17,746
-As you say, my bey.
-As you say, my bey.

181
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:38,346
What makes a state is the obedience
of its people, Günalp Bey.

182
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:44,186
Your loyalty to Emir Sadettin
will strengthen both you and the state.

183
00:33:45,386 --> 00:33:47,906
And bring peace and tranquility to us.

184
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:54,506
I'm glad to have brought peace
to this land with a man such as yourself.

185
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:59,186
The peace that Ertuğrul
would have denied us...

186
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:02,026
we will enjoy together.

187
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,146
The time of reckoning will come, Ertuğrul.

188
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:22,146
It will come.

189
00:34:23,906 --> 00:34:27,906
I will deal with you
when you get to Söğüt.

190
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:46,146
Ertuğrul Bey got knocked down to size,
turned tail and ran.

191
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:58,186
If Ertuğrul Bey
wasn't so loyal to his state,

192
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:01,226
he would have executed you on the spot.

193
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:06,226
And after what you did, Governor,
I would have let him.

194
00:35:11,106 --> 00:35:15,146
Günalp Bey, the peace treaty
has been rewritten as per your orders.

195
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:17,906
Leave it.

196
00:35:53,506 --> 00:35:54,466
If...

197
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:59,786
you make any attempt to harm Ertuğrul
when he reaches Söğüt, I will crush you.

198
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,426
Don't forget that.

199
00:36:06,786 --> 00:36:08,946
That dagger mark will remind you of it.

200
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,226
Think carefully before you sign it.

201
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:17,146
Know well what will happen
if you don't keep your word.

202
00:36:20,306 --> 00:36:24,466
May God render our
peace treaty everlasting.

203
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:39,426
Aydoğmus,

204
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:43,306
escort Governor Kritos out of the castle.

205
00:36:43,866 --> 00:36:44,866
As you command.

206
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:37,626
What's going on?

207
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,986
Come on, let's go see.

208
00:38:02,786 --> 00:38:05,706
-Don't take the flag down.
-Why are they doing this?

209
00:38:06,946 --> 00:38:09,306
-Why are you taking it down?
-Look! He's taking it down.

210
00:38:09,426 --> 00:38:12,346
-What are you doing?
-This isn't right.

211
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:15,146
What are you doing? What is this?

212
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,946
What are you doing, son?
Why are you taking down our banner?

213
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,946
Our Sultan commands it.

214
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:36,546
Ertuğrul Bey is no longer
the frontier bey.

215
00:38:38,466 --> 00:38:41,266
-What does that mean?
-What did he say?

216
00:38:43,586 --> 00:38:46,466
-How could this be?
-What are you talking about?

217
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:50,706
The new frontier bey is Günalp Bey.
That's why we're taking down the banners.

218
00:38:50,866 --> 00:38:52,786
This was sure to happen.

219
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:54,866
We told you it would, Aslıhan Hatun.

220
00:38:56,546 --> 00:38:57,906
This is not the time.

221
00:38:58,266 --> 00:39:01,826
We said we shouldn't stand against
the state. Ertuğrul Bey didn't listen.

222
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:04,306
We can't migrate to Söğüt now.

223
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:06,146
Beys.

224
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,306
Is this the time to say such things?

225
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:14,906
Say what you will to Ertuğrul Bey
when he gets back.

226
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,626
-She's right.
-She's right.

227
00:39:18,906 --> 00:39:21,106
We should wait for Ertuğrul Bey.

228
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:24,186
What do you think you're doing?

229
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:27,786
Mother. What do we do now?

230
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:29,906
Are we just going to stand here?

231
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:35,306
We need to be patient, my girl.

232
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:37,906
Ertuğrul Bey will return to us soon.

233
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:41,026
We'll deal with this
as we've dealt with trouble before.

234
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:42,746
We will!

235
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:21,346
May I come in, my bey?

236
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:27,986
Come.

237
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:39,666
Ertuğrul and all his alps
have left the castle, my bey.

238
00:40:46,826 --> 00:40:49,226
God Almighty commands in the Qur'an,

239
00:40:51,226 --> 00:40:53,426
"We fulfilled Our promise to them
in the end:

240
00:40:54,026 --> 00:40:56,506
We saved them and those
We wished to save,

241
00:41:00,266 --> 00:41:02,186
and We destroyed those who
exceeded all bounds."

242
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,386
Do you think you're overstepping, my bey?

243
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,466
Do you doubt you did the right thing?

244
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:15,146
I have fought shoulder
to shoulder with Ertuğrul Bey.

245
00:41:16,146 --> 00:41:18,026
I saw for myself

246
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:21,506
that his strength, his resolve
and his courage come from his faith.

247
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:25,186
When you stand side by side
with such a man...

248
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:28,026
how can doubt not eat you up inside?

249
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,066
So, you doubt not only yourself,

250
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:36,426
but Emir Sadettin as well.

251
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:51,106
I won't let the death of your father,

252
00:41:51,266 --> 00:41:55,306
your mother
or these valiant men be in vain.

253
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:58,826
I will put an end
to this damn war of princes.

254
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:03,986
I will make an honorable soldier,
an honorable castle commander, out of you.

255
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:28,386
Emir Sadettin is like a father to me.

256
00:42:30,186 --> 00:42:32,266
But I fear he may be on the wrong path.

257
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,986
May I enter, my bey?

258
00:42:38,946 --> 00:42:39,866
Come.

259
00:42:45,386 --> 00:42:47,346
Emir Sadettin has sent
a pigeon with a message.

260
00:42:58,706 --> 00:43:02,506
{\an8}<i>Our sultan and state are at risk.</i>

261
00:43:03,026 --> 00:43:07,746
<i>I await you at the caravansary.</i>
<i>Make haste. Emir Sadettin Köpek.</i>

262
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:11,906
Emir Sadettin awaits.

263
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,746
Prepare my horse!

264
00:43:23,906 --> 00:43:26,106
Send the scouts to the Kayi tribe.

265
00:43:26,746 --> 00:43:29,306
I want to be kept informed
of Ertuğrul's every move.

266
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:30,786
Yes, my bey.

267
00:44:13,386 --> 00:44:15,466
Come, Marya, sit.

268
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:32,346
I'm here to help you
get revenge on the Turks, sir.

269
00:44:33,026 --> 00:44:35,026
You don't need to do anything, Marya.

270
00:44:36,986 --> 00:44:39,786
You have served me
well enough all this time.

271
00:44:41,626 --> 00:44:43,746
You can live as you wish from now on.

272
00:44:47,026 --> 00:44:49,426
I stayed with the Turks
for a long time, sir.

273
00:44:49,546 --> 00:44:53,146
I know a great deal about Ertuğrul Bey
and the rest of his kin.

274
00:44:54,106 --> 00:44:56,306
I can point out
their many weaknesses to you.

275
00:44:57,226 --> 00:44:59,786
All I want is to serve our holy cause.

276
00:45:01,826 --> 00:45:04,986
Ertuğrul has to die.
Only you are capable of doing it.

277
00:45:07,306 --> 00:45:09,786
I will do anything to achieve it.

278
00:45:12,786 --> 00:45:13,866
Wonderful.

279
00:45:17,146 --> 00:45:18,226
And...

280
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:22,746
what have you heard about Ares?

281
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:24,746
Nothing, sir.

282
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,826
Last I knew, he'd been taken to Konya.

283
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:30,826
Ares...

284
00:45:32,026 --> 00:45:36,506
has managed to escape
Ertuğrul and now serves me.

285
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:42,626
How could this be, sir?

286
00:45:44,746 --> 00:45:46,666
He killed my brother.

287
00:45:47,626 --> 00:45:48,546
I know.

288
00:45:50,506 --> 00:45:52,186
If you want to stay here...

289
00:45:53,866 --> 00:45:57,386
you will have to resolve
your dispute with Ares, Marya.

290
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,986
You will have to reconcile
if you are both to serve our cause.

291
00:46:04,586 --> 00:46:08,146
I want you to get close
to him and earn his trust.

292
00:46:10,986 --> 00:46:13,026
You will bring me news of him.

293
00:46:15,746 --> 00:46:19,466
Ares... may use me
to recover his reputation

294
00:46:20,346 --> 00:46:23,066
so that he can become governor again.

295
00:46:25,026 --> 00:46:28,346
He's not one of us, but we can use him.

296
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:34,026
As you wish, sir.

297
00:46:45,986 --> 00:46:50,466
Hayme Hatun, Ertuğrul Bey has been
relieved of his position as frontier bey.

298
00:46:51,666 --> 00:46:53,306
You cannot stand up to the state.

299
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:57,266
If we migrate to Söğüt,
they'll never leave us be there.

300
00:46:57,626 --> 00:46:59,146
Let go of this ambition.

301
00:47:00,226 --> 00:47:03,746
It is our responsibility to stay here
and protect our tribe.

302
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:07,066
Migrating to Söğüt makes no sense.

303
00:47:18,106 --> 00:47:19,586
What is this, beys?

304
00:47:20,506 --> 00:47:22,186
Why are your voices raised?

305
00:47:23,946 --> 00:47:26,186
What makes no sense? Tell me.

306
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:29,706
Ertuğrul Bey,
they've got us in a corner.

307
00:47:30,706 --> 00:47:34,666
You're no longer the frontier bey.
Give up on the migration.

308
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:37,706
Don't throw us into the fire.

309
00:47:39,746 --> 00:47:41,706
Titles come and go, beys.

310
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,186
What lasts forever is the will of God.

311
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:54,106
Our path is clear.
It is a hard one. Rough.

312
00:47:54,546 --> 00:47:57,426
But there is light at the end of it.
It's for the best.

313
00:47:58,346 --> 00:48:03,706
Söğüt was entrusted to us
by Sultan Alaeddin.

314
00:48:07,706 --> 00:48:11,506
It falls on us to protect
that which was entrusted to us.

315
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:15,666
We won't leave Söğüt to anyone else.

316
00:48:17,026 --> 00:48:21,826
Those who lack the strength to ride
this path have no place among us.

317
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,506
We follow this path with the brave,

318
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:28,146
with those who do
not fear for their lives.

319
00:48:28,746 --> 00:48:33,586
The ones who aspire to this path
are welcome to come with us.

320
00:48:34,586 --> 00:48:38,226
Those who don't can stay here in peace.

321
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:47,506
Excuse us, Ertuğrul Bey.

322
00:49:21,906 --> 00:49:24,106
Don't let anyone despair.

323
00:49:25,506 --> 00:49:28,546
Don't think that we were crushed
and forced to retreat.

324
00:49:30,186 --> 00:49:33,666
We are like a bow pulled tight.

325
00:49:34,506 --> 00:49:38,186
When the times comes,
we will let loose like an arrow.

326
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:51,386
If the Cavdars leave us now
it will be to their disadvantage.

327
00:49:56,946 --> 00:49:58,746
We should not let that happen.

328
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:06,946
My bey, what if the Cavdar beys
insist on staying where they are?

329
00:50:07,866 --> 00:50:10,226
I've said all I will, Aslıhan Hatun.

330
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:13,426
Those who have the strength
will come with us.

331
00:50:14,426 --> 00:50:17,786
Those who don't can stay here in peace.

332
00:50:25,346 --> 00:50:26,506
Turgut.

333
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:33,226
If the Cavdars don't come,
you must remain at the head of your tribe.

334
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:40,666
You must stay with the Cavdars,
even if we go to Söğüt.

335
00:50:45,906 --> 00:50:47,386
Stay as their bey.

336
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:55,146
I...

337
00:50:56,146 --> 00:50:58,626
How can I stay if you leave, my bey?

338
00:51:03,066 --> 00:51:04,226
Turgut.

339
00:51:05,026 --> 00:51:08,426
The bey of a tribe is its mast.

340
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:14,146
If a tribe loses its leader,

341
00:51:14,826 --> 00:51:19,506
it will sway and bend
like a leaf in the wind.

342
00:51:37,546 --> 00:51:38,826
As you command, my bey.

343
00:52:24,786 --> 00:52:28,466
Traitors! Scum! Let go!

344
00:52:29,306 --> 00:52:31,426
-Let go of me!
-Get down!

345
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:35,466
What's the meaning of this, Sadettin?

346
00:52:39,466 --> 00:52:42,746
Revenge, Taceddin Pervane.

347
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:43,826
Let go!

348
00:52:51,426 --> 00:52:52,826
Revenge.

349
00:53:00,746 --> 00:53:01,586
So...

350
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,306
So you thought
you could go behind my back?

351
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:12,626
Did you think I wouldn't make you
and the ones behind you pay?

352
00:53:12,786 --> 00:53:15,386
Did you think I wouldn't
exact my retribution?

353
00:53:16,146 --> 00:53:20,226
You think that your betrayal
and plotting will go unpunished? Scum!

354
00:53:21,026 --> 00:53:21,986
Bastard!

355
00:53:29,826 --> 00:53:33,066
Everyone will see who the scum is.

356
00:53:35,706 --> 00:53:40,426
Do you think I don't know
what an immoral man you are?

357
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:47,026
Did you think I didn't know about
your affair with that singer from Akşehir?

358
00:53:48,026 --> 00:53:51,106
-Lies! Slander!
-It's true.

359
00:53:51,426 --> 00:53:54,506
I have the witnesses to prove it.

360
00:53:55,506 --> 00:54:00,946
The punishment for your immoral behavior
is death by stoning.

361
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:08,466
I will put the wheels of justice in motion
and have you stoned, Taceddin Pervane.

362
00:54:08,786 --> 00:54:11,626
Your reputation will be destroyed.

363
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:15,986
Liar! Slanderer! Bastard!

364
00:54:17,306 --> 00:54:20,666
Sadettin Köpek!
You won't get your hands on this state!

365
00:54:21,346 --> 00:54:24,426
You have killed innocent people,
just like you are about to do to me.

366
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:28,946
A hero will rise and put an end to you,
count on it!

367
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:36,506
This state is mine!

368
00:54:41,866 --> 00:54:43,786
Understand? It's mine!

369
00:54:44,266 --> 00:54:46,626
Nobody can stop me!

370
00:54:49,746 --> 00:54:51,506
Let go of me! Let go!

371
00:54:58,706 --> 00:54:59,906
Bastards!

372
00:55:14,106 --> 00:55:16,786
The state is mine!

373
00:55:18,386 --> 00:55:20,106
I'll kill every one of you!

374
00:55:25,266 --> 00:55:29,706
The whole world will know
who Sadettin Köpek is!

375
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:43,786
Take him away.

376
00:55:44,426 --> 00:55:47,306
Bury him up to his waist
and have him stoned in the morning.

377
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:48,546
Yes, Eminence.

378
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:26,709
-Here, Brother.
-Thank you.

379
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:29,189
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

380
00:56:29,509 --> 00:56:31,149
-Here, love.
-Thank you.

381
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:38,069
Both Cavdar beys...

382
00:56:39,789 --> 00:56:42,469
and our people look like
they want to stay.

383
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:50,229
As things currently stand,
on the orders of my bey, I'll stay here.

384
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:55,469
I can't bring myself to do it.

385
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:02,869
However, I can't cross my bey either.

386
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:09,149
Things will work out, Turgut.

387
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:10,269
Don't you worry.

388
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:14,509
They may decide to come with us,
and we can go all together.

389
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:18,869
Even if you stay here,
Söğüt is just around the corner.

390
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:21,549
We'll fight many more battles together.

391
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:24,069
Of course, Brother.

392
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:28,789
We'll go from battle to battle together.

393
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,909
I hope so, Brother.

394
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:45,389
Come on, stop sulking everyone.

395
00:57:45,669 --> 00:57:47,309
It's not the end of the world.

396
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:51,629
Just as Ertuğrul Bey earned
his status as Margrave with his efforts,

397
00:57:51,909 --> 00:57:53,149
he'll get it again.

398
00:57:55,469 --> 00:57:59,429
We need to stand strong beside him.

399
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:08,029
They are trying to intimidate us
with all kinds of plotting.

400
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:11,829
However, we will never yield.

401
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:15,549
We won't give in to their cruelty.

402
00:58:18,549 --> 00:58:22,429
So long as Emir Sadettin is alive,
this won't stop.

403
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:25,829
That bastard needs to die.

404
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:29,549
We'll never be at peace
as long as he's alive.

405
00:58:34,229 --> 00:58:36,229
His time will come, too, Aslıhan Hatun.

406
00:58:37,749 --> 00:58:39,229
There's time for that.

407
00:58:39,669 --> 00:58:40,789
Rest easy.

408
00:58:41,669 --> 00:58:44,309
He'll keep getting stronger as we wait.

409
00:58:44,949 --> 00:58:46,549
That bastard has to die.

410
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:50,269
However, many more will die.

411
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:52,029
Many more.

412
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:56,269
What was that, Aslıhan Hatun?
What do you mean?

413
00:58:57,189 --> 00:59:01,269
Emir Sadettin is a man
blinded by ambition.

414
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:07,109
I fear many innocents will die
because of his ambition and hatred.

415
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,269
God protect us from his evil.

416
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:12,589
Ertuğrul Bey wants us to wait.

417
00:59:13,229 --> 00:59:14,469
There must be a reason.

418
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:20,469
Let that bastard think...

419
00:59:21,309 --> 00:59:22,709
that he's won this time.

420
00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:27,669
These lands will be awash
with his blood at the end of all this.

421
00:59:29,309 --> 00:59:33,629
I hope so, Turgut.
I hope no more innocents die.

422
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:32,309
May I enter?

423
01:00:33,989 --> 01:00:35,069
Come in, son.

424
01:00:40,229 --> 01:00:42,429
-<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum.</i>
-<i>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.</i>

425
01:00:51,069 --> 01:00:53,709
Those seeking peace
find anguish instead, son.

426
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:58,669
This world is a burden on the believers.

427
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:03,189
Tell me, what makes you so sad?

428
01:01:04,229 --> 01:01:05,589
What are you burdened with?

429
01:01:06,189 --> 01:01:08,269
We beat our enemies one by one.

430
01:01:10,349 --> 01:01:13,149
However, we're troubled
by the traps of the traitors

431
01:01:13,229 --> 01:01:16,109
struck at the heart of our country
like a rusty dagger.

432
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:22,029
I'm putting up with this cruelty

433
01:01:23,269 --> 01:01:25,389
so that our country may not be tarnished,

434
01:01:26,389 --> 01:01:28,469
and the innocent don't die.

435
01:01:32,469 --> 01:01:36,229
However, it's hard on my people.

436
01:01:37,229 --> 01:01:40,669
Bigger troubles find those
with higher authority, son.

437
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,109
You are responsible for the people.

438
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:47,989
That's why it's heavy on you.

439
01:01:49,269 --> 01:01:51,309
However, you have God's help.

440
01:01:52,229 --> 01:01:54,309
That's because you don't act with greed.

441
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:57,429
You do what's right in the name of God.

442
01:02:02,069 --> 01:02:07,669
Sometimes, what may look like a loss
is actually a victory.

443
01:02:09,629 --> 01:02:12,349
I was just reading Surah Al-Fath.

444
01:02:13,509 --> 01:02:17,069
I was amazed by God's wisdom once again.

445
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:21,509
Prophet Muhammad once had a dream,

446
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:24,669
and had his followers prepare...

447
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:29,109
for <i>umrah</i> based upon it.

448
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:33,189
His companions were overjoyed...

449
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:38,629
because some had to leave their families,

450
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:42,709
others their jobs
and houses in Mecca due to Hegira.

451
01:02:43,669 --> 01:02:46,549
They took to the road
with their burning sense

452
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:49,709
of seeing Mecca years later,

453
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:52,789
and with the hopes
of seeing Kaaba once again.

454
01:02:53,989 --> 01:02:58,469
However, those practicing idolatry,
who found out about their visit,

455
01:02:59,589 --> 01:03:01,069
tried to obstruct the Muslims

456
01:03:02,189 --> 01:03:04,589
upon learning that the Muslims would visit

457
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:08,229
even when they'd let even the enemy in.

458
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:13,829
At last, a messenger was sent
and they made a deal.

459
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:18,509
This deal was seemingly
against the Muslims.

460
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:23,709
They would return without being able
to see Kaaba as per the deal.

461
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:26,469
The Muslims were upset.

462
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:30,229
It was heavy on their hearts
not being able to see Kaaba,

463
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:33,949
which they had been waiting

464
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:36,589
to see for so long.

465
01:03:39,509 --> 01:03:42,989
However, as it says in Surah Inshirah,

466
01:03:43,749 --> 01:03:47,389
surely, ease comes along with the trouble.

467
01:03:48,549 --> 01:03:51,389
God's wisdom manifests itself.

468
01:03:53,509 --> 01:03:57,269
Surah Al-Fath was sent
on the way back to Madinah.

469
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,829
Our Prophet was announced
with the good news of conquest.

470
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:09,309
God said thus in Surah Al-Fath:

471
01:04:11,749 --> 01:04:14,709
"Indeed, we've given you a clear conquest.

472
01:04:16,909 --> 01:04:20,909
That God may forgive what preceded
of your sin and what will follow.

473
01:04:22,669 --> 01:04:24,789
And complete his favor upon you,

474
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:27,829
and guide you to a straight path.

475
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:33,109
And God may aid you
with a mighty victory."

476
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:39,429
Good and wisdom is hidden
in what we see as bad.

477
01:04:41,229 --> 01:04:44,589
May God let us see that good.

478
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,389
Amen, son.

479
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:55,189
Now, you must bear with
the bellowing people.

480
01:04:55,749 --> 01:04:57,909
They are like fire now.

481
01:04:59,509 --> 01:05:03,189
And if that fire spreads to the country,

482
01:05:04,349 --> 01:05:05,429
it'd hurt everyone.

483
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:09,469
Your path is full of hardships now.

484
01:05:10,149 --> 01:05:11,069
It's dark.

485
01:05:13,149 --> 01:05:16,029
However, light awaits at the end.

486
01:05:18,709 --> 01:05:20,589
Keep walking that path, son.

487
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:24,389
I'll pray for you.

488
01:05:27,069 --> 01:05:28,069
Thank you.

489
01:05:56,629 --> 01:05:58,629
You wanted to see me, Your Highness?

490
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:11,549
The men Taceddin Pervane
sent to kill Sadettin...

491
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:15,149
they failed, Mother.

492
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:20,269
Köpek got away from the ambush.

493
01:06:21,949 --> 01:06:23,909
They killed Taceddin's men.

494
01:06:25,749 --> 01:06:27,629
Now, he'll be even more cautious.

495
01:06:30,109 --> 01:06:31,429
What about Taceddin Pervane?

496
01:06:31,749 --> 01:06:33,189
Nobody knows where he is.

497
01:06:35,269 --> 01:06:38,109
But I'm sure Köpek
will find him right away.

498
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:41,269
Köpek will kill him.

499
01:06:42,629 --> 01:06:44,669
He'll kill him like he did Altun Aba.

500
01:06:46,909 --> 01:06:50,309
Today, he'll be stronger
and more frantic than before.

501
01:06:51,789 --> 01:06:56,469
Grant his wishes until your authority
allows you to kill him, Your Highness.

502
01:06:57,709 --> 01:07:00,589
You must do this for the well-being
of our country.

503
01:07:00,749 --> 01:07:01,749
Enough of that!

504
01:07:02,989 --> 01:07:03,989
Enough!

505
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:07,029
This all happened because of you.

506
01:07:08,189 --> 01:07:10,149
Because of your greed!

507
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:13,069
And now, you want me to serve
under that dog.

508
01:07:14,069 --> 01:07:16,909
You have to, son.

509
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:18,109
That's not true.

510
01:07:18,829 --> 01:07:21,229
-That's not true, Mother!
-Then, what will you do?

511
01:07:23,389 --> 01:07:25,909
If he knows that you are against him,
he'll kill you.

512
01:07:27,629 --> 01:07:29,949
And he'll give the throne
to one of his children.

513
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:34,589
Köpek has a grasp on all the officials
in our government.

514
01:07:35,069 --> 01:07:36,469
He is the government.

515
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:41,669
Control your anger.

516
01:07:43,989 --> 01:07:46,269
First, get me out of the room
you locked me in.

517
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:50,389
Once you get back from Amid with victory,

518
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:53,909
everyone will see who the real
ruler of our country is.

519
01:07:56,749 --> 01:07:58,709
And it will mean Sadettin's end.

520
01:08:02,989 --> 01:08:04,549
We will go along with it

521
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:07,589
if patience is what it takes
for the throne.

522
01:08:10,149 --> 01:08:12,349
We will make him pay, soon.

523
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:32,269
So,

524
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:35,829
they killed yet another young prince.

525
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:41,589
I can't bear it, Ertuğrul.

526
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:46,709
The country that my forefathers strived
so hard to build is in tatters now.

527
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:53,229
And now, it's our turn.

528
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:58,189
We won't shun
our country because of traitors.

529
01:08:59,309 --> 01:09:01,269
We won't turn our backs on it.

530
01:09:01,709 --> 01:09:04,029
They will perish sooner or later.

531
01:09:05,389 --> 01:09:10,269
But our duty is to strive
to keep our country straight.

532
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:13,389
Ertuğrul Bey.

533
01:09:14,389 --> 01:09:16,549
Our people may lose hope

534
01:09:17,149 --> 01:09:19,669
now that you are no longer a margrave.

535
01:09:21,789 --> 01:09:25,709
If they lose their hope,
it's our job to give them hope.

536
01:09:26,469 --> 01:09:29,389
If they collapse, it's our job
to build them back up.

537
01:09:31,429 --> 01:09:33,109
Talk to the women, Halime.

538
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:36,029
Tell them to stay resolute

539
01:09:36,989 --> 01:09:38,349
and strong.

540
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:46,949
Spring always comes after winter.

541
01:09:47,549 --> 01:09:49,909
And all nights store dawn in its wake.

542
01:09:52,749 --> 01:09:54,269
May I enter, sir?

543
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:56,949
What could it be?

544
01:09:57,469 --> 01:09:58,669
I hope nothing bad.

545
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:01,669
Come in, Artuk Bey.

546
01:10:08,269 --> 01:10:09,269
Sir.

547
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:14,109
I shall excuse myself.

548
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:16,589
I'll go see Aslıhan Hatun.

549
01:10:16,989 --> 01:10:17,989
All right, love.

550
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,509
What is it, Artuk Bey?

551
01:10:31,789 --> 01:10:34,029
There's a letter
from the White Beards, sir.

552
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:48,509
"The Oghuz beys will revolt.

553
01:10:49,789 --> 01:10:52,589
The country and Turkmen tribes
will fall out with each other."

554
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:57,509
It seems they are sick of the doings
of Sadettin Köpek.

555
01:10:58,869 --> 01:11:02,869
We can't let our country and those tribes
fall out with each other because of him.

556
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:06,869
The White Beards want us
to stop this revolt.

557
01:11:08,029 --> 01:11:12,109
If we can't stop it fast,
it'll be the end of our country.

558
01:11:20,749 --> 01:11:21,749
Abdur Rahman!

559
01:11:27,389 --> 01:11:29,309
-Yes, sir.
-Send for my brother, Sungur,

560
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:33,389
Turgut Bey and Commander Bamsi.

561
01:11:33,749 --> 01:11:35,229
Have them ready their men.

562
01:11:35,829 --> 01:11:37,749
Prepare the horses,
we'll depart right away.

563
01:11:38,589 --> 01:11:39,789
As you wish, sir.

564
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:10,149
So, I saved my country
from an immoral and greedy man

565
01:12:10,509 --> 01:12:12,789
like Taceddin Pervane.

566
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:18,389
We will now rid our country
of all these cancerous men.

567
01:12:18,789 --> 01:12:20,429
Ertuğrul included.

568
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:30,669
I know you would do anything
for the good of our country.

569
01:12:33,509 --> 01:12:34,629
However, Ertuğrul...

570
01:12:37,349 --> 01:12:39,909
I doubt he'd go against
the traditions of our country.

571
01:12:48,029 --> 01:12:49,349
What do you mean, Günalp?

572
01:12:50,349 --> 01:12:52,629
Ertuğrul Bey would have done anything
to protect the castle

573
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:55,029
and his status, if he so wanted.

574
01:12:57,269 --> 01:12:59,589
However, he gave up
what was rightfully his

575
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:02,189
so that he wouldn't go
against the country.

576
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:27,669
Günalp...

577
01:13:28,789 --> 01:13:29,789
Son.

578
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:37,029
You still haven't realized
Ertuğrul's true motives.

579
01:13:39,109 --> 01:13:41,669
Ertuğrul gave up on what was
rightfully his not because of that,

580
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:47,189
but because of the fact that
his power couldn't match mine.

581
01:13:49,349 --> 01:13:51,389
If it was any other emir,

582
01:13:51,749 --> 01:13:54,069
he wouldn't even pay heed to Sultan.

583
01:13:56,789 --> 01:13:58,869
I traveled with Ertuğrul Bey.

584
01:13:59,989 --> 01:14:01,309
I fought back-to-back with him.

585
01:14:01,949 --> 01:14:02,949
He's a brave man.

586
01:14:03,869 --> 01:14:08,829
I didn't see greed for power,
not in his words, nor his eyes.

587
01:14:12,469 --> 01:14:14,149
But you know best.

588
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:20,069
Günalp.

589
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:21,549
My brave son.

590
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:26,149
You, too, will one day see

591
01:14:26,349 --> 01:14:28,149
the kind of man Ertuğrul really is.

592
01:14:29,309 --> 01:14:32,989
You will have no doubts
about his treachery, either.

593
01:14:33,709 --> 01:14:36,109
However, never mind that now.

594
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:39,069
There's something more important.

595
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:41,909
I called you here for that.

596
01:14:42,549 --> 01:14:43,549
Yes, sir.

597
01:14:44,789 --> 01:14:49,109
Some Turkish beys will try
to unite and revolt.

598
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:53,669
Revolt? But why?

599
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:58,989
They lost control after
Sultan Alaeddin’s passing away.

600
01:14:59,269 --> 01:15:03,989
And since Sultan Gıyaseddin is still
a child to them, they want to revolt.

601
01:15:04,389 --> 01:15:07,909
They think they can
steal whatever they want

602
01:15:08,309 --> 01:15:10,509
from the country and bring forth disorder.

603
01:15:11,349 --> 01:15:15,269
But our country would never yield
to some marauders.

604
01:15:16,309 --> 01:15:17,309
Would it?

605
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:19,789
Never.

606
01:15:21,909 --> 01:15:26,869
The well-being of our country
depends on you, Günalp.

607
01:15:27,309 --> 01:15:31,149
You must put an end to this mutiny.

608
01:15:31,989 --> 01:15:36,469
Make an example of them
so they can never forget.

609
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:40,429
As you wish, Your Highness.

610
01:15:41,229 --> 01:15:42,349
Go now.

611
01:15:45,989 --> 01:15:46,989
Excuse me.

612
01:15:47,629 --> 01:15:48,629
You may leave.

613
01:16:04,949 --> 01:16:07,669
It was obvious
Emir Sadettin wouldn't stop.

614
01:16:08,949 --> 01:16:09,949
I knew it.

615
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:14,469
But nobody listened to me.

616
01:16:15,829 --> 01:16:21,309
Nobody. We'll be in even more
trouble if we go to Söğüt.

617
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:25,909
We will fall apart because of
that bastard Sadettin Köpek.

618
01:16:27,389 --> 01:16:31,469
He'll cause bigger troubles
if nobody stops him.

619
01:16:41,269 --> 01:16:43,869
It's all my fault.

620
01:16:45,829 --> 01:16:47,309
What did you say, Aslıhan?

621
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,749
What does it have to do with you?

622
01:16:51,709 --> 01:16:53,909
Ever since I became Turgut's wife,

623
01:16:54,749 --> 01:16:57,029
he treats both of us as his enemy.

624
01:16:57,629 --> 01:17:01,349
He hurts me and those around me.

625
01:17:02,269 --> 01:17:04,509
He's blinded by the thirst of revenge.

626
01:17:05,669 --> 01:17:09,429
He won't leave us be
as long as he lives.

627
01:17:10,589 --> 01:17:11,669
Aslıhan Hatun.

628
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:14,389
We must leave this matter to the men.

629
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:16,389
All we can do is be patient.

630
01:17:17,389 --> 01:17:20,589
This matter affects
both men and women alike.

631
01:17:21,509 --> 01:17:24,589
We must kill that bastard
where and when

632
01:17:25,269 --> 01:17:27,909
he least expects it

633
01:17:28,509 --> 01:17:30,189
so he can't run away.

634
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:33,229
Aslıhan Hatun.

635
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:34,949
You will see.

636
01:17:35,229 --> 01:17:39,029
Ertuğrul Bey and Turgut Bey
will beat him.

637
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,829
Emir Sadettin has the whole country
backing him.

638
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:46,189
It will be hard for Turgut
and Ertuğrul Bey

639
01:17:46,309 --> 01:17:48,629
to deal with him now.

640
01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:53,109
If they cross Sadettin Köpek,
innocents will die.

641
01:17:55,389 --> 01:17:58,309
It's better for one person to die...

642
01:18:01,629 --> 01:18:05,909
to save thousands,
instead of thousands of innocents dying.

643
01:20:17,069 --> 01:20:18,149
<i>Aslıhan...</i>

644
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:20,149
Sister.

645
01:20:24,109 --> 01:20:26,789
<i>He was a bey to you,</i>
<i>and a brother to me.</i>

646
01:20:28,109 --> 01:20:32,269
<i>He was a terrific man</i>
<i>that put up with me and supported me.</i>

647
01:20:32,989 --> 01:20:35,429
He has now passed from this world.

648
01:20:35,709 --> 01:20:37,549
He rests in peace here.

649
01:20:37,989 --> 01:20:40,429
Now, it's our turn to stand up for him.

650
01:20:41,429 --> 01:20:42,789
We will stand erect.

651
01:20:43,949 --> 01:20:47,629
We will protect our tribe, traditions

652
01:20:47,869 --> 01:20:49,789
and our unity in his path.

653
01:20:50,189 --> 01:20:51,189
Let it be known

654
01:20:52,189 --> 01:20:54,429
that our tribe will not
be left without a leader.

655
01:20:55,429 --> 01:20:56,989
Until a new bey is elected,

656
01:20:58,149 --> 01:21:02,029
I will shoulder my brother's legacy.

657
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:08,149
I swore to protect our tribe, Brother.

658
01:21:10,909 --> 01:21:12,549
I promised that I would not let

659
01:21:13,429 --> 01:21:16,869
our tribe fall apart,
and that I'd protect it.

660
01:21:37,109 --> 01:21:38,709
I gave up on my life

661
01:21:39,869 --> 01:21:41,149
for our tribes,

662
01:21:41,869 --> 01:21:44,389
for my Turgut and Ertuğrul Bey.

663
01:21:58,509 --> 01:22:03,949
It's now time to take revenge
on that bastard Sadettin Köpek.

664
01:22:10,069 --> 01:22:13,709
You will die by my hands, Köpek!

665
01:23:27,589 --> 01:23:28,709
What's he doing here?

666
01:23:29,029 --> 01:23:30,629
Isn't he one of Günalp's dogs?

667
01:23:34,469 --> 01:23:36,389
Who are you to stop me in my tracks?

668
01:23:36,909 --> 01:23:38,349
You shall not pass, Ertuğrul Bey.

669
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:46,069
And who is stopping me? You?

670
01:23:46,349 --> 01:23:47,469
I will!

671
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:16,029
I see. You are one of Köpek's dogs,
and you owe this boldness to him.

672
01:24:16,389 --> 01:24:18,189
Watch your mouth, Ertuğrul Bey.

673
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:20,949
I'm a soldier of this country.

674
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,869
If you go against a soldier
of your country,

675
01:24:24,349 --> 01:24:25,789
you will pay for it dearly.

676
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:36,229
You heard him, everyone.

677
01:24:37,749 --> 01:24:39,069
Don't draw your swords.

678
01:24:46,109 --> 01:24:47,109
Attack!

679
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:10,589
Ertuğrul Bey.
I'm a soldier of your government.

680
01:26:14,869 --> 01:26:16,869
You are lucky that I'm in a hurry,

681
01:26:17,429 --> 01:26:19,949
or I'd have beaten you to a pulp.

682
01:26:20,029 --> 01:26:23,269
If you attempt something like this again,

683
01:26:23,869 --> 01:26:25,949
I'll crush you under the shoes
of my horse.

684
01:26:26,749 --> 01:26:29,069
Tell this to the one holding your leash.

685
01:26:40,309 --> 01:26:41,509
Come on, everyone.

686
01:27:04,749 --> 01:27:05,749
Everyone.

687
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:08,229
Begin the preparations.

688
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:11,629
Prepare the ox carts.

689
01:27:12,549 --> 01:27:15,549
Collect up your things.

690
01:27:17,789 --> 01:27:20,109
Have the shepherds
take our herds to the highlands.

691
01:27:21,029 --> 01:27:24,549
Prepare dried meat to eat
during the migration.

692
01:27:25,229 --> 01:27:28,709
Halime. Personally guide everyone.

693
01:27:29,069 --> 01:27:32,789
Make sure everything is prepared orderly.

694
01:27:33,309 --> 01:27:34,309
Yes, Mother.

695
01:27:34,549 --> 01:27:36,909
-May I enter, Mother Hayme?
<i>-</i>Come in, dear.

696
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:44,829
Aslıhan Hatun wasn't at her tent,
Mother Hayme.

697
01:27:44,989 --> 01:27:47,229
I looked everywhere, asked everyone.

698
01:27:47,469 --> 01:27:50,029
-Nobody saw her.
-What did you say, Bürçe?

699
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:51,829
Where could she have gone?

700
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:55,069
I don't know. She took some of her things.

701
01:27:55,389 --> 01:27:56,789
Her horse wasn't there, either.

702
01:27:56,909 --> 01:27:59,749
I was worried and wanted
to let you know, Mother Hayme.

703
01:27:59,869 --> 01:28:01,149
Well done, dear.

704
01:28:02,349 --> 01:28:04,869
Halime, let's go look for her.

705
01:28:05,149 --> 01:28:07,669
Dear, let the men know.

706
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:10,709
Tell them to look for Aslıhan Hatun.

707
01:28:10,909 --> 01:28:12,309
Yes, Mother Hayme.

708
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:15,069
Come on, everyone. Back to work.

709
01:28:18,229 --> 01:28:19,229
Let's go, dear.

710
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:30,989
He had Taceddin Pervane
stoned to death, Mother.

711
01:28:32,389 --> 01:28:33,669
Who is next?

712
01:28:34,349 --> 01:28:36,229
You? Or maybe it's me.

713
01:28:37,869 --> 01:28:41,669
The murderer of my father is killing
your bastards, Mother. You are next.

714
01:28:42,829 --> 01:28:45,149
Should I be happy or worried?

715
01:28:47,109 --> 01:28:48,949
Since one bastard kills another.

716
01:28:49,269 --> 01:28:50,909
Tell me, Mother, how should I feel?

717
01:28:53,309 --> 01:28:54,389
Forgive me, Son.

718
01:28:55,429 --> 01:28:56,429
Forgive me.

719
01:28:57,469 --> 01:28:58,749
What use is crying now?

720
01:28:59,869 --> 01:29:00,949
Would God forgive you?

721
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:04,629
We will all pay the price for your sin.

722
01:29:05,589 --> 01:29:08,869
I wish it was that easy
to pay for killing my father.

723
01:29:10,469 --> 01:29:12,389
You left our country to that dog.

724
01:29:12,829 --> 01:29:15,949
As long as Sadettin Köpek is alive,
he'll have control over our country.

725
01:29:36,949 --> 01:29:38,029
Emir Taceddin.

726
01:29:39,069 --> 01:29:43,109
He sent his men to kill Sadettin Köpek.
But they are all dead.

727
01:29:43,789 --> 01:29:45,989
I had to fight against them.

728
01:29:47,069 --> 01:29:48,909
I gained Köpek's trust.

729
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:51,149
Well done.

730
01:29:53,909 --> 01:29:55,749
The fact that you gained

731
01:29:56,429 --> 01:29:58,789
the trust of both Emir Sadettin
and Commander Kritos

732
01:29:59,309 --> 01:30:00,589
will benefit not just them,

733
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:03,669
but it'll help us against
the emperor, as well.

734
01:30:06,629 --> 01:30:09,669
Köpek will definitely want
to get back at him.

735
01:30:12,109 --> 01:30:14,149
They must know Taceddin's location.

736
01:30:14,629 --> 01:30:16,629
He's already sent his men after him.

737
01:30:17,509 --> 01:30:19,029
No doubt, they'll kill him.

738
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:24,029
Emir Taceddin had always crossed him.

739
01:30:26,429 --> 01:30:28,309
He killed yet another who opposed him.

740
01:30:29,949 --> 01:30:32,429
He's gained more power in the government.

741
01:30:34,509 --> 01:30:35,509
Even more than the Sultan.

742
01:30:40,549 --> 01:30:44,909
Köpek wants to use me to beat
Governor Kritos as well.

743
01:30:45,749 --> 01:30:47,749
He offered to make me a governor.

744
01:30:48,149 --> 01:30:50,429
He thinks he can make me his ally.

745
01:30:52,269 --> 01:30:54,349
He said he removed you
from your position as Margrave.

746
01:30:57,229 --> 01:30:58,229
For now.

747
01:30:59,549 --> 01:31:01,789
But justice will be served, Ahmet.

748
01:31:07,789 --> 01:31:10,629
Köpek will let you settle in Söğüt.

749
01:31:10,709 --> 01:31:13,789
However, he'll have thrown you
at the feet of Governor Kritos.

750
01:31:14,949 --> 01:31:15,949
His goal...

751
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:20,389
is to destroy your tribe
by having me and Kritos join hands.

752
01:31:22,669 --> 01:31:24,469
If the governor can't do it...

753
01:31:26,469 --> 01:31:28,669
Günalp will try to end us.

754
01:31:33,069 --> 01:31:34,909
I trust Günalp in that respect.

755
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:39,029
For now, it's good
that Günalp is the margrave.

756
01:31:39,869 --> 01:31:43,469
If Emir Sadettin tries
to attack us violently,

757
01:31:44,669 --> 01:31:46,869
Günalp will try to stop it.

758
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:51,109
He thinks Söğüt will be our grave.

759
01:31:53,149 --> 01:31:56,189
Let them think it's going to be
our grave, Bamsi.

760
01:31:58,469 --> 01:31:59,469
However...

761
01:32:00,589 --> 01:32:01,709
Nobody will be able to stop

762
01:32:01,829 --> 01:32:04,269
the holy plane tree
that will be born in Söğüt.

763
01:32:04,349 --> 01:32:05,869
<i>Allah!</i>

764
01:32:14,069 --> 01:32:16,349
Stay with the governor, Ahmet.

765
01:32:18,189 --> 01:32:20,069
Keep your connection with Köpek.

766
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:22,669
The intel you gather

767
01:32:23,389 --> 01:32:25,909
from both Köpek and the governor
is very important.

768
01:32:26,549 --> 01:32:28,789
As you wish, sir.

769
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:37,149
We're going through harsh times, Ahmet.

770
01:32:40,709 --> 01:32:43,189
I know what you are doing is not easy.

771
01:32:44,069 --> 01:32:47,189
However, bear with me a bit longer.

772
01:32:50,269 --> 01:32:51,789
It will all pass.

773
01:32:55,269 --> 01:32:58,109
And you will come to live
with us in our tribe.

774
01:32:58,829 --> 01:33:00,949
Thank you, sir. I hope so.

775
01:33:20,829 --> 01:33:22,149
Where is that girl?

776
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:24,989
If you had to go somewhere,

777
01:33:25,469 --> 01:33:27,389
why didn't you tell anyone?

778
01:33:31,309 --> 01:33:32,469
This is unacceptable.

779
01:33:36,509 --> 01:33:37,629
May I enter?

780
01:33:38,349 --> 01:33:39,669
Come in, Artuk Bey.

781
01:33:44,429 --> 01:33:45,629
What happened?

782
01:33:46,029 --> 01:33:47,669
Could you find Aslıhan Hatun?

783
01:33:47,869 --> 01:33:48,949
We looked everywhere.

784
01:33:49,429 --> 01:33:51,189
But we couldn't find her.

785
01:33:51,309 --> 01:33:52,709
Nobody saw her, either.

786
01:33:53,749 --> 01:33:55,149
Did she tell you anything?

787
01:33:55,749 --> 01:33:57,269
Where could she have gone?

788
01:33:57,829 --> 01:33:59,149
She didn't tell me anything.

789
01:33:59,469 --> 01:34:01,189
I don't understand why she'd do this.

790
01:34:05,149 --> 01:34:07,349
Emir Sadettin has the whole country
backing him up.

791
01:34:08,069 --> 01:34:12,429
It's hard for Turgut and Ertuğrul Bey
to deal with him now.

792
01:34:13,429 --> 01:34:15,629
If they cross Sadettin Köpek,

793
01:34:16,109 --> 01:34:17,349
innocents will die.

794
01:34:19,269 --> 01:34:22,389
It's better for one person to die...

795
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:29,709
to save thousands,
instead of thousands of innocents dying.

796
01:34:33,629 --> 01:34:34,629
Mother!

797
01:34:35,829 --> 01:34:36,829
Artuk Bey!

798
01:34:38,389 --> 01:34:41,389
I'm afraid Aslıhan Hatun
went to Emir Sadettin.

799
01:34:42,789 --> 01:34:44,429
What did you say?

800
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:48,349
Why would she go there?

801
01:34:49,069 --> 01:34:51,389
I was with Aslıhan Hatun yesterday.

802
01:34:52,109 --> 01:34:55,389
She keeps blaming herself
for what Emir Sadettin has done.

803
01:34:57,109 --> 01:35:01,509
She said it's better for one person
to die if it saves thousands.

804
01:35:03,669 --> 01:35:06,949
I'm afraid he went to Emir Sadettin
to kill him.

805
01:35:09,349 --> 01:35:11,549
She's sacrificing herself to save us.

806
01:35:12,469 --> 01:35:13,589
That's not possible.

807
01:35:14,189 --> 01:35:15,429
Oh, Aslıhan, my dear.

808
01:35:18,469 --> 01:35:19,949
May God protect her.

809
01:35:20,349 --> 01:35:21,349
Amen.

810
01:35:22,509 --> 01:35:25,909
Then, let me send our alps
to check all the roads to Konya.

811
01:35:26,469 --> 01:35:27,869
That'd be good, Artuk Bey.

812
01:35:29,909 --> 01:35:30,909
Go in peace.

813
01:35:41,063 --> 01:35:45,063
We haven't been able to live peacefully
since Sultan Alaeddin passed away.

814
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:48,983
That devil, so called Sadettin Kopek,

815
01:35:49,303 --> 01:35:51,583
wants to remove us from our own homeland.

816
01:35:52,983 --> 01:35:56,303
We'll show both Kopek and the state
who we are

817
01:35:56,623 --> 01:35:58,543
We will!

818
01:36:00,303 --> 01:36:03,863
Everyone swear an oath on their swords.

819
01:36:16,583 --> 01:36:19,703
Ertuğrul Bey<i>, </i>son of Suleyman Shah
and the leader of the Kayis, is here.

820
01:36:22,383 --> 01:36:23,663
Ertuğrul Bey is here.

821
01:36:24,543 --> 01:36:25,623
Ertuğrul Bey.

822
01:36:25,743 --> 01:36:26,823
Ertuğrul Bey<i>?</i>

823
01:36:31,503 --> 01:36:35,143
Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

824
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:37,583
Thank you, glorious beys of Oguz.

825
01:36:37,983 --> 01:36:38,983
Please take a seat.

826
01:36:39,223 --> 01:36:40,223
Thanks.

827
01:36:52,143 --> 01:36:53,503
Here you go, Ertuğrul Bey.

828
01:36:53,623 --> 01:36:54,623
Thank you.

829
01:37:05,063 --> 01:37:07,063
What brings you here, Ertuğrul Bey<i>?</i>

830
01:37:07,463 --> 01:37:09,583
Are you here to support us?

831
01:37:12,143 --> 01:37:14,863
Put your swords,
on which you were going to swear,

832
01:37:15,623 --> 01:37:17,223
back in their sheaths, beys<i>.</i>

833
01:37:19,263 --> 01:37:21,183
I'm not here to support you,

834
01:37:22,183 --> 01:37:23,703
I'm here to stop you.

835
01:37:28,783 --> 01:37:33,063
We all know you for your bravery
and your honesty, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

836
01:37:34,863 --> 01:37:36,143
We respect you.

837
01:37:37,263 --> 01:37:38,743
But the issue is different.

838
01:37:39,303 --> 01:37:41,503
We can't take it anymore.

839
01:37:42,663 --> 01:37:44,223
There is no turning back from this path.

840
01:37:44,423 --> 01:37:46,703
Right, there is no turning back.

841
01:37:48,503 --> 01:37:50,903
I know about Sadettin Kopek's cruelty

842
01:37:51,743 --> 01:37:53,263
better than any one of you.

843
01:37:55,343 --> 01:37:58,543
But rebellion is not the way

844
01:37:59,743 --> 01:38:03,703
to stop him and to warn the state.

845
01:38:05,423 --> 01:38:07,103
What else can we do, Ertuğrul Bey<i>?</i>

846
01:38:07,783 --> 01:38:10,263
Should we just sit
and watch his massacres?

847
01:38:10,863 --> 01:38:11,863
Beys<i>...</i>

848
01:38:12,623 --> 01:38:14,223
Mongols in the eastern borders,

849
01:38:14,823 --> 01:38:16,903
Byzantium in the western borders,

850
01:38:17,143 --> 01:38:19,143
they are all waiting for a weakness.

851
01:38:21,423 --> 01:38:27,063
They will bite, the moment
our state shows any weakness.

852
01:38:29,463 --> 01:38:32,983
A rebellion will weaken the state.

853
01:38:33,623 --> 01:38:36,663
We can't risk our state

854
01:38:37,543 --> 01:38:39,343
just to get rid of Kopek.

855
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:44,983
Don't burn your home
to frighten the mouse away.

856
01:38:46,903 --> 01:38:51,423
We can't risk our homes and the state
just because of Kopek.

857
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:55,703
Surely Kopek will be destroyed.

858
01:38:57,783 --> 01:39:01,263
We are glorious beys of Oguz.

859
01:39:03,703 --> 01:39:07,463
Instead of rebelling,
we should be thinking seriously.

860
01:39:12,303 --> 01:39:14,063
Let's not stigmatize our reputation

861
01:39:15,183 --> 01:39:17,703
and let's not leave a tainted legacy.

862
01:39:20,623 --> 01:39:22,863
Being silent won't help us, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

863
01:39:25,343 --> 01:39:29,343
We will get rid of this state
and establish a new one if necessary.

864
01:39:32,023 --> 01:39:33,503
But we won't turn back from this path.

865
01:39:33,783 --> 01:39:35,063
We will not!

866
01:40:00,823 --> 01:40:01,903
Lady Mahperi...

867
01:40:03,223 --> 01:40:04,903
Welcome, Vizier Sadettin.

868
01:40:07,743 --> 01:40:09,143
Thank you, Lady Mahperi.

869
01:40:10,383 --> 01:40:11,903
I see that

870
01:40:12,183 --> 01:40:15,423
as soon as you arrived, you suspended
some officials in the palace.

871
01:40:17,743 --> 01:40:20,703
And replaced them
with those who are loyal to you.

872
01:40:21,663 --> 01:40:24,143
After the deplorable incident
I went through,

873
01:40:24,423 --> 01:40:27,023
it's true that to protect our Sultan
and our state,

874
01:40:27,463 --> 01:40:31,423
I've made anyone
who is loyal to Taceddin Pervane

875
01:40:31,823 --> 01:40:34,303
disappear. That's correct.

876
01:40:36,623 --> 01:40:37,623
What was Taceddin's fault?

877
01:40:44,343 --> 01:40:48,863
I found out he had an illegitimate affair
with a songstress in Aksehir.

878
01:40:49,823 --> 01:40:54,383
Of course, we couldn't possibly
let such indecency slide.

879
01:40:56,823 --> 01:40:57,943
Right?

880
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:03,583
I hope you have proof to show

881
01:41:04,103 --> 01:41:07,503
when our Sultan asks about it,
Vizier Sadettin.

882
01:41:07,823 --> 01:41:09,583
Of course I do, Lady Mahperi.

883
01:41:10,423 --> 01:41:12,023
Don't worry.

884
01:41:13,343 --> 01:41:15,303
Maybe you heard about it.

885
01:41:15,703 --> 01:41:19,103
A couple of bandits tried
to assassinate me

886
01:41:19,543 --> 01:41:23,423
when I went to the caravansary
to meet with the governor Kritos.

887
01:41:25,823 --> 01:41:28,303
I see God has spared you for us.

888
01:41:29,063 --> 01:41:30,623
I hope you are not harmed.

889
01:41:30,823 --> 01:41:31,823
I'm fine.

890
01:41:32,543 --> 01:41:33,463
I'm very well.

891
01:41:35,663 --> 01:41:39,023
But when I figure out
those who are behind the attack...

892
01:41:41,623 --> 01:41:44,023
I will not leave their heads
attached to their bodies,

893
01:41:45,303 --> 01:41:47,823
and their eyes inside their heads.

894
01:41:49,903 --> 01:41:56,343
First, I'll remove their eyes,
which are looking down on our state.

895
01:41:57,463 --> 01:41:59,343
And then I'll chop off their heads.

896
01:42:02,983 --> 01:42:05,983
I'll do my best to help you
find out who is behind the attack.

897
01:42:16,743 --> 01:42:21,383
I see you are no longer confined
to your chambers.

898
01:42:24,543 --> 01:42:26,543
Thank God,
our Sultan realized his mistake.

899
01:42:27,743 --> 01:42:28,743
Thank God.

900
01:42:29,463 --> 01:42:30,463
Thank God.

901
01:42:30,943 --> 01:42:33,783
May God protect our Sultan.

902
01:42:36,943 --> 01:42:38,223
Lady Mahperi...

903
01:42:39,903 --> 01:42:42,583
Hopefully, we'll make
our state everlasting.

904
01:42:43,863 --> 01:42:48,023
We'll crush our enemies under our boots.

905
01:43:01,063 --> 01:43:03,863
They are taking back the lands
which were given to us by our late Sultan.

906
01:43:04,703 --> 01:43:06,103
They are increasing the taxes.

907
01:43:07,503 --> 01:43:11,863
And they are crushing anyone
who has close relations with us.

908
01:43:13,903 --> 01:43:16,023
We've had enough
of their cruelty, Ertuğrul Bey!

909
01:43:40,423 --> 01:43:41,423
If...

910
01:43:42,783 --> 01:43:46,743
the solution was to rebel,

911
01:43:47,583 --> 01:43:51,943
I would be the first one to rebel.

912
01:43:53,703 --> 01:43:55,983
There have been many bastards
like Sadettin.

913
01:43:56,823 --> 01:44:01,903
Yet, they were all beaten
before they reached their goals.

914
01:44:03,143 --> 01:44:04,143
But,

915
01:44:04,543 --> 01:44:07,423
the state has been always there.

916
01:44:10,423 --> 01:44:11,743
And so it will be.

917
01:44:13,623 --> 01:44:14,623
Now,

918
01:44:15,423 --> 01:44:20,703
if you love your state and your home,
put your swords back in their sheaths.

919
01:44:26,663 --> 01:44:28,023
Otherwise,

920
01:44:29,583 --> 01:44:32,663
you'll be standing against me.

921
01:44:56,383 --> 01:44:59,983
Swords don't go back to their sheaths
once they are drawn, Beys!

922
01:45:00,823 --> 01:45:03,023
Kutlu Bey<i>, </i>don't you know...

923
01:45:05,263 --> 01:45:08,023
that a misguided sword
ends up cutting its owner?

924
01:45:11,783 --> 01:45:13,423
The beys did the right thing.

925
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:17,663
You talk like you are supporting
Sadettin Kopek, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

926
01:45:20,423 --> 01:45:22,023
Did he send you here?

927
01:45:28,783 --> 01:45:30,183
There are some words...

928
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:33,143
which can end wars.

929
01:45:34,223 --> 01:45:36,103
And there are words
that make you lose your head.

930
01:45:38,623 --> 01:45:40,623
Watch your words, Kutlu Bey<i>.</i>

931
01:45:45,823 --> 01:45:49,623
Everyone knows about my fight
against Sadettin Kopek.

932
01:45:51,983 --> 01:45:53,463
Both your sword

933
01:45:54,423 --> 01:45:56,383
and your words are misguided.

934
01:45:57,343 --> 01:46:00,823
Then draw your sword and join us.

935
01:46:01,863 --> 01:46:04,623
And lead us on this path.

936
01:46:06,223 --> 01:46:09,263
Let's deal
with Sadettin Kopek altogether.

937
01:46:11,143 --> 01:46:16,583
The fight you're talking about
is against the state, not Sadettin.

938
01:46:17,743 --> 01:46:21,543
I don't fight against the state!

939
01:46:28,663 --> 01:46:33,663
And I don't let anyone to do so!

940
01:46:34,983 --> 01:46:39,023
When there is cruelty,
the cruel must bleed!

941
01:46:41,383 --> 01:46:43,383
It's about our traditions, Ertuğrul Bey<i>!</i>

942
01:46:46,903 --> 01:46:48,423
And shame on you all.

943
01:46:49,943 --> 01:46:54,623
My tribe will teach a lesson to Sadettin
and to the state if necessary.

944
01:47:02,503 --> 01:47:04,063
Everyone can go their own ways.

945
01:47:25,463 --> 01:47:26,583
I appreciate this, Beys<i>.</i>

946
01:47:26,943 --> 01:47:29,183
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

947
01:47:35,103 --> 01:47:36,703
Well done, Ares.

948
01:47:37,303 --> 01:47:40,783
You've regained Sadettin's trust
after all those things.

949
01:47:41,503 --> 01:47:43,023
I admire your wit.

950
01:47:43,463 --> 01:47:44,463
Thank you, Kritos.

951
01:47:45,703 --> 01:47:46,703
But...

952
01:47:48,423 --> 01:47:50,623
how did Ertuğrul escape from your trap?

953
01:47:51,543 --> 01:47:52,983
He was prepared.

954
01:47:53,663 --> 01:47:55,143
He ambushed us instead.

955
01:47:57,223 --> 01:48:00,463
I told you, it's not easy
to deal with this Turk,

956
01:48:00,623 --> 01:48:01,623
Kritos.

957
01:48:02,183 --> 01:48:03,383
You must be patient.

958
01:48:04,063 --> 01:48:05,103
You must be strong.

959
01:48:05,783 --> 01:48:08,423
Or he will kill you
just like he killed your son.

960
01:48:08,623 --> 01:48:10,983
Then he will conquer the Bilecik Castle.

961
01:48:11,623 --> 01:48:13,703
He captured me and took me to the castle.

962
01:48:14,703 --> 01:48:16,903
But you should've seen his face.

963
01:48:17,303 --> 01:48:22,023
They all went mad when they learned
he was no longer Margrave.

964
01:48:23,863 --> 01:48:25,863
Sadettin Kopek...

965
01:48:26,623 --> 01:48:28,103
strikes again.

966
01:48:29,263 --> 01:48:30,663
Now, it's up to us.

967
01:48:32,423 --> 01:48:35,023
So, what will you do?

968
01:48:35,983 --> 01:48:37,863
Will you wait for him to come to Sogut?

969
01:48:38,063 --> 01:48:42,103
I'll be fully prepared when he comes.

970
01:48:42,863 --> 01:48:44,463
Once he is here,

971
01:48:45,183 --> 01:48:48,543
he'll beg me to kill him.

972
01:48:49,703 --> 01:48:50,703
What about the peace?

973
01:48:51,063 --> 01:48:54,223
It's not possible while Ertuğrul
and Kopek are alive.

974
01:48:57,063 --> 01:48:58,743
Anyway, we'll talk later.

975
01:48:59,343 --> 01:49:01,943
I have a surprising gift for you.

976
01:49:02,343 --> 01:49:03,983
A gift, for me...

977
01:49:05,743 --> 01:49:07,143
I wonder what that is.

978
01:49:08,103 --> 01:49:09,103
The door!

979
01:49:31,823 --> 01:49:32,823
Marya...

980
01:49:36,463 --> 01:49:37,863
Governor Ares...

981
01:49:48,583 --> 01:49:49,583
Beys<i>...</i>

982
01:49:50,343 --> 01:49:52,143
Ertuğrul Bey is right.

983
01:49:53,023 --> 01:49:55,903
I hope Kutlu Bey stops
insisting on the revolt.

984
01:49:56,143 --> 01:49:57,343
Hopefully.

985
01:50:18,183 --> 01:50:20,863
What's going on? Who are you?

986
01:50:21,703 --> 01:50:24,663
Protectors of the state
against which you try to rebel!

987
01:50:32,223 --> 01:50:34,503
In the name
of Vizier Sadettin, surrender!

988
01:50:36,343 --> 01:50:38,743
Or none of you will leave here alive.

989
01:50:39,063 --> 01:50:40,263
Did you say Vizier Sadettin?

990
01:50:43,263 --> 01:50:44,943
We'll die before we surrender.

991
01:50:45,423 --> 01:50:47,063
We won't surrender!

992
01:50:51,503 --> 01:50:54,343
Vizier Sadettin ordered to kill them all,
my Bey<i>.</i>

993
01:50:54,463 --> 01:50:55,463
Why are we waiting?

994
01:50:57,943 --> 01:50:59,263
Know your place, Commander.

995
01:51:00,503 --> 01:51:01,783
Mind your own business.

996
01:51:05,703 --> 01:51:06,703
Beys<i>.</i>

997
01:51:09,423 --> 01:51:11,543
I don't want to spill blood here.

998
01:51:12,223 --> 01:51:13,503
This is my last warning.

999
01:51:14,823 --> 01:51:15,823
Surrender.

1000
01:51:15,943 --> 01:51:17,663
We don't want to spill blood either.

1001
01:51:17,943 --> 01:51:22,263
But instead of surrendering to Sadettin
we'd create a blood bath.

1002
01:51:24,503 --> 01:51:26,103
A blood bath, you say.

1003
01:51:32,103 --> 01:51:33,343
Well then, as you wish.

1004
01:52:49,623 --> 01:52:51,383
There are seven of you here.

1005
01:52:52,023 --> 01:52:54,223
But there are nine mugs here.

1006
01:52:54,943 --> 01:52:56,343
Who were the other two people?

1007
01:52:58,463 --> 01:53:01,823
Kutlu Bey<i>...</i>

1008
01:53:02,663 --> 01:53:03,663
and...

1009
01:53:04,423 --> 01:53:05,423
And?

1010
01:53:06,503 --> 01:53:08,103
Ertuğrul Bey<i>...</i>

1011
01:53:10,623 --> 01:53:11,703
Ertuğrul Bey<i>?</i>

1012
01:53:17,103 --> 01:53:19,343
Vizier Sadettin was right.

1013
01:53:21,223 --> 01:53:22,223
Where are they now?

1014
01:53:22,703 --> 01:53:23,783
Where did they go?

1015
01:53:24,503 --> 01:53:25,503
Speak up!

1016
01:53:33,943 --> 01:53:37,583
Commander! We're going after
Ertuğrul Bey<i>, </i>at once.

1017
01:53:37,943 --> 01:53:39,223
Move.

1018
01:54:10,823 --> 01:54:13,263
What do you mean by blocking my way?

1019
01:54:13,943 --> 01:54:16,343
You either give up on the revolt,

1020
01:54:16,743 --> 01:54:19,103
or I will not let you pass, Kutlu Bey<i>.</i>

1021
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:21,223
I said my final words.

1022
01:54:23,143 --> 01:54:24,463
Now get out of my way!

1023
01:54:25,263 --> 01:54:27,903
So that no harm will come to you or us.

1024
01:55:06,583 --> 01:55:08,743
I'm not here to spill blood, Kutlu Bey<i>.</i>

1025
01:55:09,503 --> 01:55:12,543
But I will turn this place
into a blood bath if necessary,

1026
01:55:13,023 --> 01:55:15,423
instead of letting you rebel
against the state.

1027
01:55:16,183 --> 01:55:18,583
That Kopek will make us all bleed
if we don't revolt.

1028
01:55:20,823 --> 01:55:22,023
What should we do?

1029
01:55:22,623 --> 01:55:24,023
Leave our own homeland?

1030
01:55:24,383 --> 01:55:26,143
No one is leaving.

1031
01:55:28,743 --> 01:55:30,463
If the tribes and the state clash

1032
01:55:30,943 --> 01:55:33,303
then the winner will be the enemy.
I won't let that happen.

1033
01:55:35,623 --> 01:55:38,103
We'll deal with this situation
without a revolt.

1034
01:55:42,663 --> 01:55:44,383
Dogs won't be barking

1035
01:55:44,863 --> 01:55:46,903
in the world of the wolves, Kutlu Bey<i>.</i>

1036
01:55:49,703 --> 01:55:52,183
That's my promise to you.

1037
01:55:56,623 --> 01:56:00,383
All the Turkish tribes will be wasted
if there is a revolt.

1038
01:56:05,943 --> 01:56:07,463
I won't let that happen.

1039
01:56:07,903 --> 01:56:11,103
And I won't let you make
such a grave mistake.

1040
01:56:35,583 --> 01:56:38,063
-Who is this woman?
-She wants to see Vizier Sadettin.

1041
01:56:41,983 --> 01:56:43,943
Why do you think you can do that?

1042
01:56:47,143 --> 01:56:48,263
Escort her out.

1043
01:56:49,383 --> 01:56:51,343
Take her to the dungeons
if she comes again.

1044
01:57:03,023 --> 01:57:04,023
Stay back!

1045
01:57:07,303 --> 01:57:10,103
Or I'll kill him and then kill you.

1046
01:57:14,303 --> 01:57:16,103
Let Vizier Sadettin know

1047
01:57:16,743 --> 01:57:18,503
that Lady Aslıhan is here.

1048
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:22,703
He knows me. He'll want to see me.

1049
01:57:27,143 --> 01:57:28,143
I'll let him know.

1050
01:57:29,423 --> 01:57:32,503
But if he refuses to see you,
then you are dead.

1051
01:57:34,023 --> 01:57:35,743
You won't leave the palace alive.

1052
01:57:38,543 --> 01:57:40,623
Now let my soldier go.

1053
01:57:53,303 --> 01:57:56,183
Vizier Sadettin is having
a council meeting with the Sultan.

1054
01:57:56,583 --> 01:57:58,183
You are going to wait.

1055
01:57:59,183 --> 01:58:01,103
And you two watch this woman.

1056
01:58:01,423 --> 01:58:03,063
If she tries to do anything

1057
01:58:03,583 --> 01:58:04,903
do whatever is necessary.

1058
01:58:12,823 --> 01:58:16,263
The enemies are getting bolder
and bolder, my Sultan.

1059
01:58:18,463 --> 01:58:21,383
That's mostly because
of your young age, my Sultan.

1060
01:58:24,303 --> 01:58:28,183
They see your lack of experience
and they get bolder, my Sultan.

1061
01:58:29,783 --> 01:58:32,463
That's why, your and the army's reputation

1062
01:58:33,143 --> 01:58:36,583
will be affected badly if you go to fight
for Amid,

1063
01:58:36,743 --> 01:58:40,183
without conquering
the Samsat Castle first.

1064
01:58:42,343 --> 01:58:43,743
Vizier Sadettin is right.

1065
01:58:44,343 --> 01:58:46,543
That's right. It's not the time
to fight for Amid.

1066
01:58:50,383 --> 01:58:51,543
That's the reason why

1067
01:58:51,823 --> 01:58:53,383
we, as your subjects in the council,

1068
01:58:53,823 --> 01:58:57,783
don't think going to fight for Amid

1069
01:58:57,903 --> 01:58:59,503
is the right thing for you to do.

1070
01:59:07,423 --> 01:59:08,423
Then,

1071
01:59:08,783 --> 01:59:11,663
get my army ready so that I can conquer
the Samsat Castle first.

1072
01:59:13,463 --> 01:59:15,703
The army still needs some time

1073
01:59:16,023 --> 01:59:19,543
to trust your leadership, my Sultan.

1074
01:59:21,623 --> 01:59:23,543
What do you mean, Vizier Sadettin?

1075
01:59:26,903 --> 01:59:30,063
I mean I'll be in command.

1076
01:59:32,463 --> 01:59:35,343
Of course, if you excuse me.

1077
01:59:36,583 --> 01:59:38,943
Once I have conquered the Samsat Castle,

1078
01:59:39,183 --> 01:59:42,223
you can go with the army to fight

1079
01:59:42,543 --> 01:59:45,503
and save us from the trouble of Amid.

1080
02:00:37,463 --> 02:00:41,743
It's a great happiness for me
to have such considerate officials.

1081
02:00:44,063 --> 02:00:47,343
If it wasn't for your help
I wouldn't be able

1082
02:00:47,783 --> 02:00:49,663
to manage the state properly.

1083
02:00:50,223 --> 02:00:52,703
I'd like you to know
I'm grateful to you, Vizier Sadettin.

1084
02:00:55,423 --> 02:00:56,343
You have a point.

1085
02:00:56,823 --> 02:00:59,383
Go to Samsat Castle and defeat the enemy.

1086
02:01:03,463 --> 02:01:06,303
Then, with you
and the other precious officials

1087
02:01:07,023 --> 02:01:09,383
I will go to fight for Amid.

1088
02:01:11,103 --> 02:01:12,903
May God help you, Sadettin.

1089
02:01:14,903 --> 02:01:17,903
May God protect you, my Sultan.

1090
02:01:33,983 --> 02:01:36,543
Vizier Sadettin killed my father,
Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

1091
02:01:37,943 --> 02:01:39,343
Do you know why?

1092
02:01:40,783 --> 02:01:42,103
He wanted my father

1093
02:01:43,343 --> 02:01:44,943
to kill Bektas Bey

1094
02:01:45,303 --> 02:01:47,503
because Bektas Bey didn't obey
Sadettin's orders.

1095
02:01:51,743 --> 02:01:54,583
My father chose to protect him
instead of killing him.

1096
02:01:56,903 --> 02:01:59,823
And for that reason,
Sadettin murdered my father.

1097
02:02:01,143 --> 02:02:05,023
Sadettin also tried to make my father
kill his blood brother, Kurtoglu.

1098
02:02:06,263 --> 02:02:08,623
He managed to make the leader of Cavdars
kill his own son.

1099
02:02:10,863 --> 02:02:12,023
And he got our sultan killed

1100
02:02:13,063 --> 02:02:15,303
by his chef, Nasuriddin Ali.

1101
02:02:17,743 --> 02:02:19,663
What are you saying, my Ertuğrul Bey<i>?</i>

1102
02:02:20,223 --> 02:02:22,303
Wasn't it a natural death?

1103
02:02:22,623 --> 02:02:25,623
His own son, Sultan Giyaseddin, said so.

1104
02:02:26,063 --> 02:02:30,703
At first, Sadettin tried to accuse me
of the killing of our late Sultan.

1105
02:02:31,583 --> 02:02:34,183
He wanted to get rid of me and my alps<i>.</i>

1106
02:02:35,263 --> 02:02:37,303
His intention was to hang me

1107
02:02:38,623 --> 02:02:40,223
but the Sultan saw the truth.

1108
02:02:41,223 --> 02:02:43,863
Then, he managed to release you
of your duties as Margrave.

1109
02:02:44,383 --> 02:02:46,863
Thank God, brother.
You finally understand.

1110
02:02:53,063 --> 02:02:55,463
What a dishonorable man he is,
Ertuğrul Bey!

1111
02:02:55,583 --> 02:03:00,103
He is the biggest problem
our state is facing right now.

1112
02:03:02,863 --> 02:03:03,863
Also know that,

1113
02:03:04,623 --> 02:03:07,743
he surrounded our Sultan
with officials who are loyal to himself.

1114
02:03:07,943 --> 02:03:09,063
The Sultan?

1115
02:03:11,023 --> 02:03:14,103
Our Sultan is a prisoner of Sadettin
in his own palace.

1116
02:03:16,383 --> 02:03:19,943
We all need to unite
to get rid of this bastard.

1117
02:03:21,303 --> 02:03:23,463
The question is when to kill the bastard,

1118
02:03:26,503 --> 02:03:28,823
not if.

1119
02:03:31,463 --> 02:03:34,183
That's what we are discussing, Kutlu Bey<i>.</i>

1120
02:03:39,383 --> 02:03:43,663
We would be wasted if the tribes
which have problems with Sadettin

1121
02:03:44,263 --> 02:03:45,623
joined a rebellion.

1122
02:03:46,383 --> 02:03:48,583
There would be too much blood, Kutlu Bey<i>.</i>

1123
02:03:51,623 --> 02:03:54,943
And Mongols would take the opportunity
to get rid of our state.

1124
02:03:56,623 --> 02:04:00,423
We, the Turkish tribes,
would be the ones that suffer, again.

1125
02:04:03,463 --> 02:04:06,663
Now, do you understand
our Ertuğrul Bey<i>, </i>Kutlu Bey<i>?</i>

1126
02:04:09,423 --> 02:04:11,903
My rage clouded my judgment.

1127
02:04:12,983 --> 02:04:15,503
I have to tell you
that you have a solid point, Ertuğrul <i>Bey.</i>

1128
02:04:17,383 --> 02:04:18,383
If you are available

1129
02:04:19,263 --> 02:04:23,183
I'd like to invite you to my tribe
to talk with my uncle, Garkin Bey<i>.</i>

1130
02:04:24,583 --> 02:04:28,023
We'd be happy to be your guests
in your tribe.

1131
02:04:31,263 --> 02:04:32,263
Thank you.

1132
02:04:36,423 --> 02:04:37,703
We're being attacked!

1133
02:04:42,743 --> 02:04:44,863
Protect yourselves!

1134
02:04:53,023 --> 02:04:54,383
Come on brother!

1135
02:05:07,863 --> 02:05:11,823
-This way!
-Protect yourselves, brothers!

1136
02:05:54,143 --> 02:05:56,503
How could you give up
on the fight for Amid

1137
02:05:56,583 --> 02:05:59,263
just because that bastard, Sadettin,
said so, my Sultan?

1138
02:06:00,943 --> 02:06:02,903
Don't you know that demon's intentions?

1139
02:06:03,303 --> 02:06:04,783
How could you do that?

1140
02:06:05,503 --> 02:06:08,863
I know he is frightened
to see me victorious

1141
02:06:08,943 --> 02:06:12,023
and for my reputation to grow
in the eyes of the officials, Mother.

1142
02:06:12,303 --> 02:06:15,623
That's why he wants
to increase his influence

1143
02:06:15,783 --> 02:06:18,303
by conquering Samsat Castle,
and thus controlling me.

1144
02:06:19,263 --> 02:06:23,063
Then why did you allow him
to do what he wanted?

1145
02:06:24,943 --> 02:06:26,943
You taught me how to be a sultan, mother.

1146
02:06:27,863 --> 02:06:30,863
You taught me to be the hunter
instead of the hunted.

1147
02:06:32,223 --> 02:06:34,063
What do you mean, son?

1148
02:06:35,103 --> 02:06:38,623
Vizier Sadettin won't come
back to Konya ever again,

1149
02:06:39,023 --> 02:06:42,783
whether he conquers the Samsat Castle
or not.

1150
02:06:47,183 --> 02:06:49,183
No one can hear us here, Mother.

1151
02:06:50,223 --> 02:06:51,263
Don't worry.

1152
02:06:52,783 --> 02:06:54,383
What are you saying, son?

1153
02:06:54,903 --> 02:06:58,663
For the first time,
I decided a sentence with my own will.

1154
02:07:00,183 --> 02:07:02,383
The death sentence of Vizier Sadettin.

1155
02:07:09,623 --> 02:07:10,743
What are you saying, son?

1156
02:07:11,583 --> 02:07:12,623
Goodness gracious.

1157
02:07:27,023 --> 02:07:28,023
I told you.

1158
02:07:29,703 --> 02:07:32,423
You'll be begging me.

1159
02:07:37,103 --> 02:07:38,423
Here you are, Aslıhan.

1160
02:08:47,143 --> 02:08:49,343
<i>Any gem I carve...</i>

1161
02:08:50,063 --> 02:08:53,903
<i>shines only when a beautiful woman</i>
<i>who deserves it, wears it.</i>

1162
02:08:55,103 --> 02:08:58,743
This necklace will shine on your neck.

1163
02:08:59,663 --> 02:09:01,583
I've made it for you.

1164
02:09:06,023 --> 02:09:07,303
I'd be sorry if you refused.

1165
02:09:13,423 --> 02:09:15,383
I'd love to see you wearing it.

1166
02:09:16,703 --> 02:09:18,343
Thank you, blessed Vizier.

1167
02:09:20,823 --> 02:09:22,503
I've made a necklace...

1168
02:09:24,583 --> 02:09:28,623
using my late mother's precious gems

1169
02:09:29,623 --> 02:09:31,263
for you.

1170
02:09:34,143 --> 02:09:38,903
I put it on your tender...

1171
02:09:40,623 --> 02:09:42,463
elegant neck...

1172
02:09:43,983 --> 02:09:45,583
after you swore

1173
02:09:46,143 --> 02:09:48,343
to be my wife forever.

1174
02:09:49,823 --> 02:09:51,263
And what did you do?

1175
02:09:53,943 --> 02:09:56,143
You married a lowly alp<i>.</i>

1176
02:10:02,343 --> 02:10:04,263
I should kill you, Aslıhan.

1177
02:10:05,343 --> 02:10:07,943
I should make Ertuğrul and Turgut
grieve for you

1178
02:10:09,263 --> 02:10:12,783
before I kill them.

1179
02:10:23,823 --> 02:10:24,823
Or should I...

1180
02:10:25,383 --> 02:10:28,263
make you the wife
of Sultan Sadettin, huh?

1181
02:10:30,623 --> 02:10:31,623
Or should I...

1182
02:10:31,983 --> 02:10:33,943
feed birds with your skin?

1183
02:10:34,823 --> 02:10:35,823
What should I do?

1184
02:10:36,503 --> 02:10:40,503
Tell me, Aslıhan. What should I do?
Tell me, huh?

1185
02:10:43,223 --> 02:10:44,383
May I come in?

1186
02:10:50,823 --> 02:10:53,223
Blessed Vizier, may I come in?

1187
02:11:06,583 --> 02:11:07,663
Yes.

1188
02:11:35,263 --> 02:11:38,703
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

1189
02:11:42,983 --> 02:11:44,183
What about me, Aslıhan?

1190
02:11:46,823 --> 02:11:49,223
Should I also be grateful to you

1191
02:11:50,263 --> 02:11:52,663
after all the pain you put me through?

1192
02:11:54,943 --> 02:11:57,943
I came to you just like you said.

1193
02:11:58,783 --> 02:12:01,063
Now, the past has passed.

1194
02:12:04,983 --> 02:12:05,903
I wish...

1195
02:12:11,223 --> 02:12:14,463
But the past affects the present, Aslıhan.

1196
02:12:18,063 --> 02:12:20,023
I can't forget the past...

1197
02:12:22,463 --> 02:12:24,343
neither can it desert me.

1198
02:12:28,263 --> 02:12:29,783
I'm here to beg you.

1199
02:12:43,503 --> 02:12:45,103
So you came to beg.

1200
02:13:06,103 --> 02:13:07,663
Is everyone alright?

1201
02:13:07,823 --> 02:13:09,703
-Yes, my Bey.
-Yes, my Bey.

1202
02:13:27,143 --> 02:13:28,943
Who are they, Ertuğrul Bey<i>?</i>

1203
02:13:29,943 --> 02:13:32,023
Sadettin must've learned
about your meeting.

1204
02:13:32,743 --> 02:13:34,863
How? It's not possible.

1205
02:13:36,343 --> 02:13:39,383
He must have a spy in one of the tribes.

1206
02:13:41,343 --> 02:13:42,823
Just like he has everywhere.

1207
02:13:56,703 --> 02:13:59,183
If you had attempted to revolt

1208
02:14:00,023 --> 02:14:04,383
anyone in your tribe, including women
and children, would have been murdered.

1209
02:14:08,463 --> 02:14:09,863
They killed my alps<i>.</i>

1210
02:14:10,343 --> 02:14:12,503
I'll kill them all.

1211
02:14:13,303 --> 02:14:15,303
Just be patient, Kutlu Bey<i>.</i>

1212
02:14:15,743 --> 02:14:16,743
We are outnumbered.

1213
02:14:17,983 --> 02:14:20,823
We need to find a way
to get out of here first.

1214
02:14:39,623 --> 02:14:41,143
Our horses are far away, my Bey<i>.</i>

1215
02:14:41,703 --> 02:14:44,983
We can't make it there if we leave here.

1216
02:14:46,183 --> 02:14:48,383
For now, we are safe here, Turgut.

1217
02:15:19,143 --> 02:15:20,183
Ertuğrul Bey!

1218
02:15:21,663 --> 02:15:23,823
In the name
of Vizier Sadettin, surrender.

1219
02:15:25,223 --> 02:15:29,023
Or you'll have a bloody death
just like the other beys at the meeting.

1220
02:15:32,703 --> 02:15:34,023
They killed them all.

1221
02:15:39,183 --> 02:15:41,943
Who has authority, Commander?

1222
02:15:52,703 --> 02:15:54,343
I do, Ertuğrul Bey!

1223
02:16:21,383 --> 02:16:22,903
Günalp Bey<i>...</i>

1224
02:16:33,860 --> 02:16:35,300
Sadettin's death warrant.

1225
02:16:36,060 --> 02:16:39,220
We'll either revive
the legacy of my father, Selcuk Bey,

1226
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:43,540
and that of my grandfather, Kutalmisoglu,
my glorious Sultan Alaeddin,

1227
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:47,540
or we'll die like insects under
the tiles of this cursed palace, Mother.

1228
02:16:49,780 --> 02:16:51,260
This game will end here.

1229
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:56,540
What kind of order is this, son?
We'll lose everything.

1230
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:59,260
What do we have to lose, Mother?
What will we lose?

1231
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:02,260
Our rotten bodies?

1232
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:05,740
Will we lose our souls,
the ones we sold to a degenerate?

1233
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:10,740
Can't you see that he will
bring us down eventually?

1234
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:13,420
We have no choice.

1235
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:15,740
But how would it work?

1236
02:17:17,060 --> 02:17:20,860
Do you think they'll let you
kill that bastard Sadettin openly?

1237
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:23,660
Not openly, Mother. Not openly.

1238
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:28,260
He'll go into the Samsat battle
a victorious commander.

1239
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:30,860
But only his corpse will come back.

1240
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:34,780
Who could you possibly trust to do this

1241
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:37,020
when it endangers not only yourself
but also the state?

1242
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:39,900
Ertuğrul Bey.

1243
02:17:46,020 --> 02:17:47,580
Why would you trust him, my Sultan?

1244
02:17:48,220 --> 02:17:50,620
Mother, open your eyes.

1245
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:55,100
Ertuğrul Bey was always loyal
to his state and my father.

1246
02:17:56,060 --> 02:17:57,500
If my brother had lived,

1247
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:00,780
he'd have fought for him to be Sultan
with the last breath in his body.

1248
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:04,580
But you killed my brother.

1249
02:18:05,940 --> 02:18:09,340
So Ertuğrul Bey will be loyal to me
to ensure our state will survive.

1250
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:12,100
And I have not the smallest doubt in him.

1251
02:18:14,940 --> 02:18:20,100
Now, you either help me
and Ertuğrul Bey kill Sadettin,

1252
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:25,100
or Sadettin kills us and sweeps
through our state like a plague.

1253
02:18:27,540 --> 02:18:28,620
It's your decision, Mother.

1254
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:33,780
So tell me, Mother.

1255
02:18:34,580 --> 02:18:38,060
Will you trust Ertuğrul Bey as I do?

1256
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:44,500
Do we have any other choice?

1257
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:55,500
Ertuğrul Bey sent me this letter.
Read it, Mother.

1258
02:19:01,460 --> 02:19:05,460
<i>My Sultan, your decree has stripped me</i>
<i>of the Beylic your father gave to me.</i>

1259
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:08,020
{\an8}<i>Even though you were the one to seal it,</i>

1260
02:19:08,380 --> 02:19:10,980
{\an8}<i>I know it was written</i>
<i>at the direction of Emir Sadettin.</i>

1261
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:14,580
<i>It's obvious that he rules</i>
<i>the state in your name.</i>

1262
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:17,140
<i>It's time you made a decision, my Sultan.</i>

1263
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:21,660
<i>Either Sadettin dies,</i>
<i>or our state collapses.</i>

1264
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:25,260
<i>Either our state lives or we die.</i>

1265
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:27,740
<i>If you ally yourself with me,</i>

1266
02:19:28,420 --> 02:19:31,740
<i>I promise to serve you faithfully</i>
<i>and bring the traitor to account.</i>

1267
02:19:32,180 --> 02:19:35,460
<i>Otherwise, I will finish this myself.</i>
<i>It's your decision.</i>

1268
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:38,100
<i>Suleyman Shah's son, Ertuğrul.</i>

1269
02:19:41,020 --> 02:19:44,540
How can Ertuğrul overcome
the Emir by himself, son?

1270
02:19:47,980 --> 02:19:49,580
I'll be right there with him, Mother.

1271
02:19:51,340 --> 02:19:52,980
As will Governor Husamettin Karaca
of Sivas,

1272
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:56,820
who I trust completely
and Emir Sadettin avoids.

1273
02:19:58,060 --> 02:20:01,540
After I read Ertuğrul Bey's letter,
I sent word to Karaca.

1274
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:05,740
When Sadettin returns from battle
and is resting at Sivas,

1275
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:08,140
he and Ertuğrul Bey will kill the Emir.

1276
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:12,300
That's why you changed
your mind about Amid.

1277
02:20:13,460 --> 02:20:18,420
That's why you sent Sadettin to Samsat,
to keep him away from Konya.

1278
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:30,340
Forgive me, son.

1279
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:34,580
I killed your father without trusting you.

1280
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:38,300
Now I understand that I made
a terrible mistake.

1281
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:44,260
You should know, until my last breath,
I will never betray you.

1282
02:20:55,580 --> 02:20:56,780
May God help us.

1283
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:06,340
What's he doing here, Bey?

1284
02:21:07,060 --> 02:21:08,060
Obviously,

1285
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:13,220
Sadettin Kopek has assigned his best man
to stop the rebellion against him.

1286
02:21:14,140 --> 02:21:15,140
Ertuğrul.

1287
02:21:16,180 --> 02:21:18,740
Can you still trust this man
to do the right thing?

1288
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:27,180
He's either a soldier blinded by loyalty

1289
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:30,540
or nothing more than
Sadettin Kopek's puppet.

1290
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:35,860
If he keeps acting this way,
I'll kill him with my own two hands,

1291
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:37,900
however good his intentions are.

1292
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:43,580
There's only eight of you there.

1293
02:21:46,060 --> 02:21:47,660
Resistance is pointless.

1294
02:21:53,300 --> 02:21:54,300
Ertuğrul Bey,

1295
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:57,540
I intend to take your life myself.

1296
02:21:59,340 --> 02:22:00,540
Surrender now.

1297
02:22:01,980 --> 02:22:05,380
Forget his intentions, my Bey.
Let's kill them all.

1298
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:13,500
-I'm going to talk to him.
-Don't do it, Ertuğrul.

1299
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:17,260
He thinks you're working
with the traitors.

1300
02:22:18,900 --> 02:22:20,420
There's no way he'll believe you.

1301
02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:23,540
I have to, brother.

1302
02:22:25,540 --> 02:22:27,100
Let's talk, Günalp Bey.

1303
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:31,260
I'm not interested
in anything you have to say.

1304
02:22:32,340 --> 02:22:35,380
I've seen what type of a man you are.

1305
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:40,180
What are you doing, my Bey?

1306
02:22:41,740 --> 02:22:44,740
I'm looking for a way to stall them
so we can get out of here, Turgut.

1307
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:47,180
Take care of yourselves.

1308
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:09,180
Listen to me, Günalp Bey.

1309
02:23:11,660 --> 02:23:13,860
If you still want to kill me after that,

1310
02:23:14,980 --> 02:23:16,300
I'll give you your chance.

1311
02:23:23,140 --> 02:23:24,140
I was right.

1312
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:27,700
So, I was right.

1313
02:23:32,660 --> 02:23:35,140
But it's not that simple, Aslihan.

1314
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:42,780
I was prepared to do anything for you.

1315
02:23:50,180 --> 02:23:53,140
Do you know who the
stones in this necklace belonged to?

1316
02:23:56,980 --> 02:23:58,220
My late mother.

1317
02:24:02,060 --> 02:24:03,060
I wanted...

1318
02:24:05,380 --> 02:24:07,300
this to adorn your beautiful neck...

1319
02:24:08,820 --> 02:24:11,700
and honor her memory with you.

1320
02:24:21,980 --> 02:24:23,220
I loved you that much.

1321
02:24:28,020 --> 02:24:29,300
I wanted you...

1322
02:24:30,860 --> 02:24:34,860
to be my wife and raise
sons and daughters who would

1323
02:24:35,620 --> 02:24:37,100
keep my legacy alive.

1324
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:42,540
What did you do?

1325
02:24:46,300 --> 02:24:48,220
You walked all over me, Aslihan.

1326
02:24:52,060 --> 02:24:55,100
You... crushed me.

1327
02:24:58,140 --> 02:25:00,660
You married Turgut.

1328
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:03,820
Turgut! For what reason?

1329
02:25:08,420 --> 02:25:10,820
Because of your loyalty to Ertuğrul.

1330
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:19,060
You destroyed

1331
02:25:19,860 --> 02:25:23,300
the strongest Emir of Seljuk, Aslihan.

1332
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:29,300
So, I was right.

1333
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:34,340
Right, right.

1334
02:25:36,500 --> 02:25:37,820
But does it matter, Aslihan?

1335
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:43,540
Does it matter?

1336
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:48,260
Seeing that I was right...

1337
02:25:50,780 --> 02:25:51,780
tell me,

1338
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:54,260
why did you come here?

1339
02:26:01,860 --> 02:26:05,580
To throw yourself at my feet
and beg for my forgiveness?

1340
02:26:11,220 --> 02:26:12,580
To seek refuge,

1341
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:16,660
and ask me to forgive Turgut and Ertuğrul?

1342
02:26:19,900 --> 02:26:21,300
Why are you here, Aslihan?

1343
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:28,820
So that you may save my tribe from
Ertuğrul's never-ending ambition.

1344
02:26:31,140 --> 02:26:37,180
So that you may stop him and Turgut taking
us to Sogut and letting us die there.

1345
02:26:41,380 --> 02:26:43,180
I beg you, Your Eminence.

1346
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:45,900
Give me my tribe back.

1347
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:52,940
Was it worth it?

1348
02:26:56,220 --> 02:26:57,220
How could it be?

1349
02:26:58,540 --> 02:27:01,300
My father, my brothers,

1350
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:05,220
many of our alps, all sacrificed
to satisfy Ertuğrul's greed.

1351
02:27:06,580 --> 02:27:07,580
How could it be?

1352
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:16,700
Here I am...

1353
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:19,500
begging...

1354
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:22,100
for your forgiveness.

1355
02:27:24,660 --> 02:27:27,700
A desperate and helpless woman...

1356
02:27:31,260 --> 02:27:35,020
and someone who you loved
not so very long ago.

1357
02:27:43,220 --> 02:27:47,100
You are the most powerful Emir
in our state.

1358
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:51,300
I'm begging you, Emir Sadettin.

1359
02:27:52,140 --> 02:27:54,860
Save my tribe from his malice.

1360
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:57,100
I'm begging you.

1361
02:28:20,860 --> 02:28:22,300
May I enter, Your Eminence?

1362
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:33,620
Come in.

1363
02:28:40,260 --> 02:28:41,260
Eminence.

1364
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:45,100
I have important news.

1365
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:50,860
Fine, get out.

1366
02:28:56,380 --> 02:29:00,660
<i>Your Eminence, Emir Sadettin,</i>
<i>the traitorous Beys rebelled against me.</i>

1367
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:02,420
<i>I killed them all.</i>

1368
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:04,820
<i>However, I then discovered</i>

1369
02:29:05,260 --> 02:29:08,180
<i>that Ertuğrul has joined a secret</i>
<i>council of disgraced beys.</i>

1370
02:29:08,860 --> 02:29:10,780
<i>They were involved in the rebellion.</i>

1371
02:29:11,500 --> 02:29:14,500
<i>I followed them but they got away.</i>

1372
02:29:15,660 --> 02:29:19,340
<i>I'll do everything I can to kill</i>
<i>Ertuğrul for rebelling against his state.</i>

1373
02:29:19,860 --> 02:29:22,060
<i>Frontier Bey Yakup Günalp Bey.</i>

1374
02:29:25,900 --> 02:29:28,300
I've got you, Ertuğrul.

1375
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:34,060
You can't escape me now.

1376
02:29:36,460 --> 02:29:39,260
I'll give you what you want,
Aslihan Hatun.

1377
02:29:42,500 --> 02:29:47,060
Turgut and Ertuğrul
have sealed their own death warrants.

1378
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:53,900
No one can save them now.

1379
02:30:32,220 --> 02:30:34,940
What... have you done, Aslihan?

1380
02:30:56,100 --> 02:30:57,740
That's for my brother Aliyar.

1381
02:31:35,140 --> 02:31:36,620
I believed your lies.

1382
02:31:37,460 --> 02:31:40,460
I even doubted Emir Sadettin,
the man I think of as a father.

1383
02:31:41,420 --> 02:31:45,460
Moreover, I risked
my own life fighting Kritos.

1384
02:31:47,820 --> 02:31:50,060
I know that you joined
that traitorous council.

1385
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:54,100
You can't fool me anymore, Ertuğrul Bey.

1386
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:58,980
Did Emir Sadettin tell you about
the council of beys?

1387
02:32:00,260 --> 02:32:01,260
Yes.

1388
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:05,180
Seems like Sadettin
not only keeps his dogs in the palace

1389
02:32:06,140 --> 02:32:08,500
but one in each village too.

1390
02:32:09,580 --> 02:32:12,460
He has already established
his own state, Günalp Bey.

1391
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:16,220
He's deceived so many innocent people.

1392
02:32:17,740 --> 02:32:20,380
-He'll pay for what he's done.
-Enough!

1393
02:32:20,980 --> 02:32:22,940
I had no idea about the council.

1394
02:32:23,620 --> 02:32:24,820
When I heard about it,

1395
02:32:25,820 --> 02:32:28,860
I went there to stop them
betraying our state.

1396
02:32:29,580 --> 02:32:33,700
You're still able to look me in the eye
and lie to me, Ertuğrul Bey.

1397
02:32:35,060 --> 02:32:36,740
Damn a traitor like you.

1398
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:41,180
There's nothing I can do
but pity you, Günalp Bey.

1399
02:32:42,980 --> 02:32:45,380
You're too weak to see the truth.

1400
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:48,300
I know only too well
what the truth is, Ertuğrul Bey.

1401
02:32:49,540 --> 02:32:50,860
You want to establish

1402
02:32:51,700 --> 02:32:53,660
your own Beylic in Sogut
by weakening the state.

1403
02:32:55,020 --> 02:32:59,140
Kopek took control of the state
by killing our Sultan.

1404
02:32:59,860 --> 02:33:01,180
You can't believe that

1405
02:33:02,180 --> 02:33:07,300
but you can believe I would try
to establish my own Beylic in a tiny land?

1406
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:11,180
Enough, Ertuğrul Bey.
Do you still disparage me?

1407
02:33:12,060 --> 02:33:14,860
Your loyalty puts me in
a difficult position, Günalp Bey.

1408
02:33:15,940 --> 02:33:20,460
If you cross the line...
and try to harm my men...

1409
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:24,980
understand that I'll kill
you myself, Günalp Bey.

1410
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:34,260
What are you waiting for?

1411
02:33:36,060 --> 02:33:37,020
Here I am.

1412
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:40,980
Let my alps go.

1413
02:33:42,860 --> 02:33:44,660
Let's you and I settle this.

1414
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:51,620
Your alps...

1415
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:53,660
and you...

1416
02:33:54,340 --> 02:33:55,740
will die here!

1417
02:34:00,940 --> 02:34:01,940
If so...

1418
02:34:03,340 --> 02:34:05,500
may God forgive your sins, Günalp Bey.

1419
02:34:07,980 --> 02:34:11,300
Go to hell, Ertuğrul Bey.

1420
02:34:33,340 --> 02:34:34,900
My God.

1421
