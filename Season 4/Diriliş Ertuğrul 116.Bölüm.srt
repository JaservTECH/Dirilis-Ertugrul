1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Episode 116 will start after 12:40 min.

2
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,600
Everything is in order
at the castle, my bey.

3
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,600
The Christians are able
to trade and practice their faith.

4
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,400
Very good. Send my regards
to the Christian people, Günalp Bey.

5
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,440
I will speak with them myself
as soon as I can.

6
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,680
Yes, my bey.

7
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,960
My Bey, upon your invitation,
scholars and merchants

8
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,400
have begun moving
to the land of your frontier beylic.

9
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,160
Good, good.
Show great respect to the scholars.

10
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,720
And treat every merchant equally.

11
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,960
Trade will flourish at our market.

12
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,480
With knowledge and craftsmanship
coming together,

13
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,440
we will become a fully-fledged
society, God willing.

14
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,680
God willing, my bey.

15
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,440
God willing, my bey.

16
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,760
We will not set up our stand
until we have found the best pitch.

17
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,000
As you wish.

18
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,840
Keep your eyes open.

19
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,120
Where gold flows like water
there will be mud in abundance.

20
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,400
May our hunt be glorious.

21
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,120
We shall soon see our sacks filled.

22
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,760
When will we begin preparations
for the migration to Sogut, my bey?

23
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,760
So that the migration to Sogut
is free of trouble and fighting,

24
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,440
and the people's
prosperity is not affected,

25
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,480
I've decided to delay it, Turgut.

26
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,720
Order has been established, thank God.

27
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,800
Once Ahmet gets here
and we have heard his news,

28
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,840
we can make a start on the preparations.

29
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,680
May it be for the good, my bey.
May it be for the good.

30
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,280
Just as the ones we have lost
have taken root in our hearts...

31
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,760
we will take root in that land,
God willing.

32
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,120
Aslıhan was the first Turk
to be buried in Sogut.

33
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,560
May it fall upon us
to rightfully settle there.

34
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,160
Amen.

35
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
God willing, Turgut. God willing.

36
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,200
-Ertuğrul Bey.
-Speak.

37
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,240
Preparations for the spring feast
are finished over at the tribe.

38
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,120
The people are waiting for you.

39
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,720
My bey, this feast will be good
for us and for our tribes.

40
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,000
I hope our good fortune increases
with the coming of spring.

41
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,000
Come on, then.
We don't want to keep the people waiting.

42
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,520
Let's celebrate the coming of spring
with a feast worthy of our traditions.

43
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,800
All right, my bey.

44
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,640
What business do those hunters have here?

45
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,040
It's obvious what they want
from the hides they're carrying, Master.

46
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,600
They want trouble.

47
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,800
Then trouble they will find.
Keep an eye on them.

48
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,120
What is it you seek, woman?

49
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,200
I find what I seek
in great forests, my man.

50
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,760
Not in your dump of a shop.

51
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,120
Then don't loiter in front of my stand.
Get going!

52
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,520
-What's this worth?
-Two gold coins.

53
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,680
You're not ashamed to ask for two gold
coins for this quiver?

54
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,440
I bet you ask three
gold coin for this, huh?

55
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,960
Who is this woman?

56
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,440
Woman!

57
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,000
Leave before I trample you
and those so-called hunters

58
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,920
you ride with under my feet.

59
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,600
Why?

60
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,160
So that you can sell goatskin
to people, saying it's deer hide?

61
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,080
I told you to leave, woman!

62
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,920
Who is the protector of this market?

63
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,040
Tell me,
who is the protector of this market?

64
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
I am.

65
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,800
And who are you?

66
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,160
Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

67
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,280
Now tell me...
who are you and what is your business?

68
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,320
My name is Almila Hatun.

69
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,240
I am a hunter and fur trader.

70
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,440
My brother is Eynece.

71
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,520
The best hunter this world has ever seen.

72
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,720
He is a scout.

73
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,880
From the tension of his bow,
and the range of his arrow,

74
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,680
not a bear or a wolf, a deer
or even a fly is safe, my bey.

75
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,600
And Master Karamis is the best tanner
the world has seen.

76
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,360
All right. Now tell me...

77
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,320
what brings you to my market
and has you arguing with my craftsmen?

78
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,160
This bastard you call a craftsman...

79
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,760
is nothing but a market thug,
Ertuğrul Bey.

80
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,560
We process the hides of the animals.
We hunt in the mountains and forests,

81
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,800
and tan them and sell them.

82
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,880
We don't sell goatskin to people
and call it deer hide,

83
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,120
like this joke of a tradesman.

84
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,640
When we fled the Mongolian threat,
we visited many markets like this one

85
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,520
and frequently suffered
at the hands of bastards like him,

86
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,720
who sell the hides we toil to hunt and tan
for two or three times their worth.

87
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,800
We are at the end
of our road now, Ertuğrul Bey.

88
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,160
Any further and we
enter the land of the infidels.

89
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,680
Either we set down here
and earn our bread honestly,

90
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,520
just like the other tradesmen who
believed in you and came here,

91
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,200
or we make raids on the infidel lands
like our ancestors did... and take lives.

92
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,640
Is what this woman says true?

93
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,840
I do what trade requires me to do, my bey.

94
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,760
My merchandise is displayed on my stand.

95
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,840
People are free to buy it or not.

96
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,800
When you process the leather
you don't use fresh acorns...

97
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
but acorns that have fallen
on the ground and crystallized.

98
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,440
As if that wasn't bad enough,

99
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,880
you haven't even managed
to give the goatskin a proper sheen.

100
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,840
You are no craftsman, you are a fraud.

101
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,480
What's worse, you're selling
goatskin by calling it deer hide.

102
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,720
Have you no shame?
You are a disgrace to all craftsmen.

103
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,480
Ertuğrul Bey, aren't you going
to put this woman in her place?

104
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,640
Our God created the heavens
and set the standards.

105
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,160
"To prove the Truth to be true,

106
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,080
and the false to be false."
Doesn't he say that in the holy Qur'an?

107
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,640
He does, my bey.

108
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,520
Does he not also say,
"Give full measure

109
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and weight. Don't withhold from people
things that are rightly theirs."

110
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,600
He does, my bey.

111
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,120
Doesn't he say, "Do not spread
corruption in the land."

112
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,880
Answer me Doesn't he?

113
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,760
He does, my bey.

114
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,680
Alps.

115
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,640
Get this troublemaker out
of my market this instant! Go!

116
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,080
Forgive me, my bey. Ertuğrul Bey!

117
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,960
Artuk Bey...

118
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,160
I don't want to see this man or
his merchandise in my market ever again.

119
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,600
As you wish, my bey.

120
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,320
Forgive me, Ertuğrul Bey.
Please don't do this.

121
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,960
Ertuğrul Bey! Don't do this! Forgive me!

122
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,400
Now speak, Almila Hatun.

123
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,920
What is it you want?

124
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,240
As our God commands,

125
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,320
I want a place at your market
to trade honestly, Ertuğrul Bey.

126
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,960
How can Ertuğrul Bey know
that you'll do your job properly, hatun?

127
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,400
We didn't come here just to sell
our goods and go out to hunt,

128
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,440
but to build a tannery
and develop trade, commander.

129
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,920
We wish to remain here,
with God's permission.

130
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,400
If we fail, you can come
and take our heads.

131
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,120
How will you manage this, hatun?
What will you do?

132
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,000
There are forests filled with acorns
in your territory.

133
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,320
We will provide jobs to the unemployed
at the tannery we will build

134
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,840
next to the river.

135
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,280
We'll bring quality goods
to the market to sell.

136
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,520
We will grow the trade
to the infidel provinces through here.

137
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,760
I have masters coming after me.

138
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,240
They are on their way.

139
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,880
They come to practice their craft
in the place that best suits them.

140
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,240
That is, if you will allow us.

141
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,200
This stand is yours and I agree
to you building a tannery, Almila Hatun.

142
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,720
However, and make sure
you understand this well...

143
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,160
I am in charge here.

144
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,040
If you go against my word,

145
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,240
you won't be able to sell your stuff here.
I will crush you.

146
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,160
Come on, Artuk Bey.

147
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,040
Be wary of that woman, Artuk Bey.

148
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
I want to know everything she does.

149
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,120
As you wish, my bey.

150
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,480
A letter has arrived
from the emperor, sir.

151
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,240
What is it, Kritos?

152
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,560
The emperor... he's decided
against sending an army.

153
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,400
He wants peace to continue.

154
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,000
Coward!

155
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,920
He stalled us for months.

156
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,440
We could have destroyed Ertuğrul
while the sultan was on the Amid campaign.

157
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,360
We can't give up, Kritos.
We can never give up.

158
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,320
I can't live without
avenging my son, Ares.

159
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,480
Not just your son,

160
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,200
we have to avenge
every soldier they killed, Kritos.

161
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,560
That is God's command to us.

162
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,000
-My son's death won't be in vain, Ares.
-It won't, Kritos.

163
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,880
Don't worry. We can do this on our own.

164
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,120
We can still avenge your son. Trust me.

165
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,920
I will finish Ertuğrul with my own army.

166
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,360
I'm putting you in charge
of preparing them, Ares.

167
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,400
Get them ready to fight the Turks.

168
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,480
We'll deal with them before Ertuğrul
migrates to Sogut with his tribe.

169
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,560
If we do this, my son may yet
rest in peace in his grave.

170
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,600
Yes, Kritos.

171
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,520
Ertuğrul Bey has returned.

172
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,600
Mother, my father's coming!

173
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,160
I'm going to learn to forge iron
with my father!

174
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,560
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you!

175
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,680
-Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.

176
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,720
Thank you!

177
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,600
My girl, you're almost due.
Why don't you go rest in the tent?

178
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,600
I'm fine, Mother, don't worry.

179
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,760
It's better if the bey's hatun
is with him on the day of the feast.

180
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,320
Welcome, Ertuğrul!

181
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,720
Welcome, my bey!

182
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,480
Welcome, my bey!

183
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,040
Thank you, thank you.

184
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,240
Thank you.
Well, would you look at my young man!

185
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,600
Father!

186
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,360
-Welcome.
-I'm glad to be back, my brave son.

187
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,760
Mother.

188
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,120
-Welcome.
-It's good to see you, Mother.

189
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,800
Welcome, my bey.

190
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
I'm so glad to see you, my doe-eyed one.

191
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,920
May God let you be with us
for many more feasts, Ertuğrul.

192
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,080
Amen. Amen, doe-eyes.

193
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,560
Father, I'm going to learn to forge iron!

194
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,240
I'm going to hit it for Savcı
and for my soon-to-be-born brother, too.

195
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,240
Just look at my brave son.

196
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,960
Then go get your hammer
and take your place next to the anvil.

197
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,480
Come on then, brave boy.

198
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,000
Valiant beys
and valiant hatuns of the Kayi.

199
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,520
Centuries ago, when our ancestors
melted the iron mountain and got out...

200
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,280
it was the first day of spring.

201
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,000
As our ancestors
melted the iron mountain and got out...

202
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
the Turks were reborn.

203
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:34,160
The Turk was reborn
and spring came to the world.

204
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,720
Now, just as we have celebrated
the coming of spring for centuries...

205
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,680
may our future generations

206
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,880
also celebrate the coming of spring
for centuries to come.

207
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,200
God willing.

208
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,960
Amen. God willing.

209
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,000
-Amen.
-Amen. God willing.

210
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,880
Amen. God willing.

211
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,160
Amen.

212
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,960
Then, as our bey,
you must strike the first blow...

213
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,360
so that the iron mountains may hear it!

214
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,240
Let our feast begin, my bey.

215
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,520
-Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
-Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

216
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,080
-Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
-Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

217
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,480
-Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
-Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

218
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,440
-Thank you, Turgut Bey.
-Thank you, my bey.

219
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,120
Günalp Bey!

220
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,560
Come, let us see your worth.

221
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,360
Thank you, my bey.

222
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,680
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

223
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,240
God is life. God is just.

224
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,320
God is life. God is just.

225
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,400
Come on, valiant beys.

226
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
-<i>Bismillah</i>.
-God is life!

227
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,080
-God is life!
-God is just!

228
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,680
-God is life!
-God is life!

229
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,240
-God is life!
-God is just!

230
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,040
God is life! God is just!

231
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,960
God is life! God is just!

232
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,000
God is life. God is just.

233
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,400
Look, the guy who told us
about this caravan was right.

234
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,600
-They're carrying plenty of merchandise.
-We're all going to be rich.

235
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,920
Come on, let's not let them get away.

236
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,240
Raid! Raid!

237
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,360
Raid!

238
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,960
Who are they?

239
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,560
Kill them!

240
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,120
I've carried many a sheep before
but it will be my first race against you.

241
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,080
Chief Alp Turgut, who is the most
formidable in the Kayi tribe?

242
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,080
We've raced against Ertuğrul Bey
since we were children.

243
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,880
Nobody's ever won a race he's
competed in yet. That's all I'll say.

244
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,440
Thank you, my friend.

245
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,240
Brave men! Will anyone else race?

246
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,120
I will, my bey!

247
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,800
-Bamsi?
-I will!

248
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,120
My brother! Welcome back!

249
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,160
How could you play Get the Goat
without Bamsi, my bey? How could you?

250
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,880
My Bey, my bey.

251
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,760
Look at my brave man.
Welcome, my brother.

252
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,600
-Welcome, my brave man.
-Glad to be here, my bey.

253
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,440
Mother, Mother Hayme. Mother...

254
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,520
-Mother Hayme.
-Welcome.

255
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,160
It's good to see you, Mother.

256
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,720
How have you been, Bamsi?

257
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,120
How is Hafsa Hatun?
How is the child, Bamsi Alp?

258
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,160
Fine. Fine!

259
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,160
My child was born, praise God.

260
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,280
-Praise be!
-Praise be!

261
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,200
Praise be.

262
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,600
I have a daughter... bright as a star!

263
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Praise be!

264
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,640
Praise be!

265
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,480
Would you look at my brother!

266
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,280
May you have armies of sons,
and tribes of daughters, my brave man!

267
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,840
Why didn't you bring them?

268
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,120
They're comfortable
where they are, my bey.

269
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,440
Let them stay a little longer,
collect themselves, then I'll bring them.

270
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,800
Very good, very good.

271
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,240
May God let her grow with
her parents, Chief Alp Bamsi.

272
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,480
Thank you, Günalp Bey. Thank you.

273
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,040
And I said the prayer into her ear.

274
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,200
And I named her... Aslıhan.

275
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,560
May God bestow many children upon you.

276
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,240
May she live long.
May she be lucky, God willing.

277
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,920
Thank you, brother. Well...

278
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,080
I've missed you all so much.

279
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,080
And I got here just in time
for the spring feast.

280
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,200
My Bey, with your permission,
I'd like to join Get the Goat,

281
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,640
get this rust off.

282
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,280
Could there be a contest without Bamsi?

283
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,480
Come on, join us
so that they may see a real competitor.

284
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,520
-Thank you, thank you, my bey!
-Get ready Bamsi, go on!

285
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,440
Thank you, my bey!

286
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,685
Fall back, quickly!

287
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:33,805
It's time to speak with Ertuğrul Bey.

288
00:41:35,605 --> 00:41:37,565
Take the caravan to Hanlı Bazaar.

289
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,245
You, come with me.

290
00:41:41,725 --> 00:41:43,085
To the Kayi Village.

291
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:00,765
Come on, men.

292
00:42:17,045 --> 00:42:18,445
<i>Bismillahirramanirrahim!</i>

293
00:42:21,965 --> 00:42:23,765
Allah!

294
00:42:24,205 --> 00:42:25,485
Come on!

295
00:42:25,845 --> 00:42:27,085
Allah!

296
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,005
Allah!

297
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:52,845
Come on!

298
00:42:53,245 --> 00:42:55,325
Go, Father! Run!

299
00:43:02,645 --> 00:43:04,005
Come on!

300
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:14,885
Come on!

301
00:43:17,365 --> 00:43:19,405
Go! Run!

302
00:43:19,645 --> 00:43:20,965
Run, Father!

303
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:27,245
Come here, Father!

304
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:31,605
Come here, Father!

305
00:43:46,085 --> 00:43:47,445
Father!

306
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:50,125
Ertuğrul Bey! Ertuğrul Bey!

307
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:52,805
You were so strong, Father!

308
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:53,885
You beat them all!

309
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,405
Grow up

310
00:43:55,805 --> 00:43:57,165
and we'll race too.

311
00:44:01,165 --> 00:44:03,205
-<i>Mashallah</i> to my men!
-<i>Mashallah</i>!

312
00:44:03,445 --> 00:44:04,485
Mashallah!

313
00:44:09,005 --> 00:44:10,805
-My bey.
-Günalp Bey.

314
00:44:12,005 --> 00:44:13,325
-My bey.
-My friend.

315
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:25,605
<i>Mashallah</i>, men.

316
00:44:27,605 --> 00:44:29,405
My dear, don't wear yourself out.

317
00:44:30,285 --> 00:44:32,005
I'm fine, don't worry.

318
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:34,205
Even when I sit, he doesn't stop.

319
00:44:36,005 --> 00:44:39,445
If he really is Osman, like we've dreamed,

320
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:41,885
then nobody will be able to stop him.

321
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:54,885
Halime, a little crazy is always good.

322
00:44:58,885 --> 00:45:00,685
Our babies should be a little crazy

323
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:04,525
so they can advance their father's legacy.

324
00:45:06,685 --> 00:45:07,805
I hope so.

325
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:23,485
My bey.

326
00:45:24,925 --> 00:45:25,765
Speak.

327
00:45:26,205 --> 00:45:28,845
Almıla Hatun from the bazaar
and two men are here.

328
00:45:28,965 --> 00:45:30,245
They wish to see you.

329
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:34,245
Who is this woman?

330
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:44,725
Where are they?

331
00:46:28,725 --> 00:46:29,925
Damn it!

332
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:37,485
Stop!

333
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:52,005
Where to?

334
00:46:58,005 --> 00:46:59,165
Answer me.

335
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:02,325
Kill this man.

336
00:47:20,965 --> 00:47:23,725
What do you wish to cover
during our council discussion?

337
00:47:24,205 --> 00:47:25,205
A discussion?

338
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:28,285
Our caravan was ambushed by bandits,

339
00:47:29,005 --> 00:47:30,885
and you want a discussion?

340
00:47:33,165 --> 00:47:34,245
Bandits?

341
00:47:39,485 --> 00:47:40,725
Where?

342
00:47:40,845 --> 00:47:43,285
The forest road. My men are dead.

343
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:45,565
Chief Alp Bamsi.

344
00:47:46,645 --> 00:47:48,805
It's been a while since we've
encountered bandits.

345
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:50,685
Where did they come from?

346
00:47:50,965 --> 00:47:52,925
The alps are always on patrol, my bey.

347
00:47:53,085 --> 00:47:54,845
The road for the caravan is clear.

348
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,325
Apparently...

349
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:00,405
not so clear.

350
00:48:11,285 --> 00:48:12,285
Ertuğrul Bey.

351
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,805
We came at your invitation.

352
00:48:16,485 --> 00:48:18,925
We were told your lands were safe.

353
00:48:20,325 --> 00:48:21,605
We trusted you.

354
00:48:22,245 --> 00:48:25,765
But our men died
before we even reached the bazaar.

355
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:31,085
We almost lost all our goods.

356
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,685
You can't hold a council meeting

357
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:38,605
and leave your guests
to the bandits' mercy.

358
00:48:40,165 --> 00:48:41,165
Woman.

359
00:48:42,165 --> 00:48:43,805
Watch your mouth.

360
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:47,405
You're speaking
to the frontier bey, Ertuğrul.

361
00:48:49,605 --> 00:48:53,525
Ertuğrul Bey secured these lands
with pride.

362
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:57,565
He won't give them up to some bandits.

363
00:49:01,845 --> 00:49:04,125
We'll take care of the bandits.

364
00:49:05,765 --> 00:49:08,525
We'll reimburse you for the lost goods.

365
00:49:09,205 --> 00:49:12,565
Bandits never lasted long
in our territory before,

366
00:49:13,205 --> 00:49:15,685
and they won't last now.

367
00:49:22,605 --> 00:49:23,725
Rest assured.

368
00:49:27,445 --> 00:49:30,285
Go back to the bazaar and do your work.

369
00:49:31,005 --> 00:49:33,285
I hope you're right, Ertuğrul Bey.

370
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:35,245
We're here for our bread.

371
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:42,685
If you can't protect us,
we'll have to protect ourselves.

372
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:45,725
Excuse us.

373
00:50:03,645 --> 00:50:05,765
The woman was out of line, my bey.

374
00:50:08,645 --> 00:50:10,205
Her caravan was ambushed.

375
00:50:12,085 --> 00:50:13,405
Her men died.

376
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,605
We'll overlook it.

377
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:22,685
Should I send men from the castle
to hunt the bandits?

378
00:50:24,085 --> 00:50:25,485
No need, Günalp Bey.

379
00:50:28,085 --> 00:50:29,125
Bamsi.

380
00:50:30,605 --> 00:50:31,765
Tell the alps.

381
00:50:33,565 --> 00:50:35,325
Turgut, Günalp Bey.

382
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:37,125
Get ready.

383
00:50:38,805 --> 00:50:41,845
We'll take care of those bandits
who are brave enough

384
00:50:42,605 --> 00:50:44,445
to ambush a caravan.

385
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:46,045
All right, my bey.

386
00:50:46,805 --> 00:50:47,845
All right, my bey.

387
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,005
Who is this man, Leon?

388
00:50:57,485 --> 00:50:58,765
I don't know, sir.

389
00:50:59,285 --> 00:51:00,845
He said he was a traveler.

390
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,485
He's no ordinary man.

391
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:06,165
I'm sure he has important information.

392
00:51:06,285 --> 00:51:07,325
About what?

393
00:51:08,205 --> 00:51:09,205
Ertuğrul.

394
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:13,405
Ertuğrul?

395
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,405
What does he want?

396
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:18,325
Ertuğrul's head.

397
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:22,205
Bring him in.

398
00:51:23,365 --> 00:51:24,405
As you wish.

399
00:52:02,325 --> 00:52:04,445
What can you tell me about Ertuğrul?

400
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:08,125
You are watching Ertuğrul.

401
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,765
You seek revenge for your son.

402
00:52:13,765 --> 00:52:16,885
But first, you must purge
the scum around you.

403
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,805
Who are you? What are you saying?

404
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:26,285
Just call me the Traveler, Governor.

405
00:53:35,565 --> 00:53:37,645
These must be the bandits.

406
00:53:39,285 --> 00:53:41,845
-They look like bandits.
-You're right, Turgut.

407
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,325
They have good swords.

408
00:53:50,925 --> 00:53:55,165
They must be good at fighting and looting.

409
00:53:57,565 --> 00:54:00,285
The merchants must be good fighters, too,

410
00:54:01,165 --> 00:54:03,325
since they gave them such a beating.

411
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,045
They sure are, my bey.

412
00:54:12,565 --> 00:54:15,205
They learned how to fight
to save themselves

413
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,725
from ambushes like this.

414
00:54:19,605 --> 00:54:20,525
Or perhaps...

415
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:24,565
they're used to fighting bandits.

416
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:29,965
My bey.

417
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:33,005
There's blood on the river bed.
It goes that way.

418
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:35,445
Come on, let's follow it.

419
00:54:58,005 --> 00:54:59,005
Did you like it?

420
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:01,165
Yes, Grandma.

421
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:05,925
I made them myself.

422
00:55:08,045 --> 00:55:10,245
Gave them to the tribe's babies.

423
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:13,605
It's the spring council.
Let's make them happy.

424
00:55:14,005 --> 00:55:15,365
Don't worry, Mother Hayme.

425
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:17,445
We'll distribute them
alongside the molasses.

426
00:55:17,725 --> 00:55:18,765
All right, dear.

427
00:55:57,805 --> 00:55:58,885
-Mother?
-Yes?

428
00:55:59,525 --> 00:56:01,405
Whoever that woman is,

429
00:56:01,845 --> 00:56:03,965
she has cast a shadow on the council.

430
00:56:05,605 --> 00:56:06,605
Oh, dear.

431
00:56:07,885 --> 00:56:11,125
Her caravan was ambushed,
so she was angry.

432
00:56:13,285 --> 00:56:16,485
Nobody should enter
a council meeting like that.

433
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:22,205
I don't know about that,
but I know I don't like her.

434
00:56:22,765 --> 00:56:25,645
Once Ertuğrul kills the bandits,

435
00:56:26,005 --> 00:56:28,965
he'll find out if the woman has
any secrets.

436
00:56:41,805 --> 00:56:42,885
What happened?

437
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:45,685
I think he kicked.

438
00:56:58,645 --> 00:56:59,645
Halime?

439
00:57:04,325 --> 00:57:05,685
Are you okay?

440
00:57:16,525 --> 00:57:18,845
My dear, that doesn't look like a kick.

441
00:57:19,325 --> 00:57:20,525
You're right.

442
00:57:21,445 --> 00:57:22,765
This isn't a kick.

443
00:57:25,645 --> 00:57:26,925
Lie down now.

444
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,165
Alçiçek.

445
00:57:28,685 --> 00:57:29,845
Prepare the bed.

446
00:57:30,285 --> 00:57:31,525
As you order.

447
00:57:39,485 --> 00:57:44,125
Gündüz, take those clothes and give them
to your brothers and sisters in the tribe.

448
00:57:44,525 --> 00:57:46,125
-Go now.
-Okay, Grandma.

449
00:57:46,605 --> 00:57:47,645
Come, dear.

450
00:57:47,805 --> 00:57:49,285
-All right then.
-Come here.

451
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:53,125
Slowly, slowly...

452
00:57:53,645 --> 00:57:54,885
Okay.

453
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:14,845
It hurts, Mother. Your grandson is coming.

454
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:18,205
Hold on, dear. Be strong.

455
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:21,845
God willing, my grandson will come.

456
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:26,205
Who knows, maybe he's our promised Osman.

457
00:58:27,445 --> 00:58:28,325
Alçiçek.

458
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:30,085
Give Savcı to me.

459
00:58:32,485 --> 00:58:33,605
Oh, dear.

460
00:58:33,925 --> 00:58:36,045
Your brother is coming.

461
00:58:37,885 --> 00:58:39,805
Alçiçek, boil some water.

462
00:58:40,245 --> 00:58:41,805
Tell the midwives.

463
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:44,325
Halime Hatun is giving birth.

464
00:58:44,885 --> 00:58:46,045
As you order.

465
00:58:50,885 --> 00:58:53,285
Mother, it hurts a lot.

466
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,325
Hold on dear, almost there.

467
00:58:56,765 --> 00:58:58,925
Hold on, Halime. Come on.

468
00:59:00,085 --> 00:59:01,045
Hold on.

469
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:04,845
Oh, my dear baby.

470
01:00:09,885 --> 01:00:12,165
Who are you? What do you want?

471
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,445
How dare you attack
a caravan in our territory,

472
01:00:16,605 --> 01:00:17,685
headed towards our bazaar?

473
01:00:18,165 --> 01:00:19,765
That's Ertuğrul! Attack!

474
01:00:46,725 --> 01:00:47,965
Who are you?

475
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:52,005
How dare you attack this caravan
on our land?

476
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:53,485
We...

477
01:00:54,285 --> 01:00:57,685
A man told us
that they were carrying many goods.

478
01:01:02,165 --> 01:01:04,325
He told us where they would be.

479
01:01:05,645 --> 01:01:06,485
Who was he?

480
01:01:07,885 --> 01:01:08,845
I don't know him.

481
01:01:09,525 --> 01:01:10,525
I don't know.

482
01:01:11,485 --> 01:01:12,565
But we believed him.

483
01:01:18,325 --> 01:01:20,565
This is not a normal caravan attack.

484
01:01:21,965 --> 01:01:25,845
Whoever that man is,
he wanted them to attack this caravan.

485
01:01:29,645 --> 01:01:33,965
Whoever he is, he must
have a problem with the tanners.

486
01:01:34,245 --> 01:01:38,325
Not just anyone could do such a thing
in our land, my bey.

487
01:01:40,165 --> 01:01:41,245
Who did this?

488
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:45,245
Who made these bandits attack

489
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:48,525
that woman and the tanners?

490
01:02:15,445 --> 01:02:18,205
Look what I brought you
from Constantinople.

491
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,765
Do you like it?

492
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:26,605
What happened, Kritos?

493
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:33,405
Emir Sadettin, the one Ertuğrul killed.

494
01:02:37,805 --> 01:02:39,405
What about him?

495
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:44,245
Did also you sleep with Emir Sadettin...

496
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:48,125
to aid in your escape
from Ertuğrul's dungeons?

497
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:49,765
Kritos!

498
01:02:50,925 --> 01:02:52,245
What are you saying?

499
01:02:52,565 --> 01:02:54,285
You used my son's pain!

500
01:02:57,125 --> 01:02:59,085
You used my hate for Ertuğrul!

501
01:03:00,085 --> 01:03:01,165
You became my woman!

502
01:03:01,805 --> 01:03:04,285
You took my deepest secrets
to Emir Sadettin!

503
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,085
How could you, Marya?
How could you?

504
01:03:07,445 --> 01:03:08,285
You will die!

505
01:03:08,365 --> 01:03:10,165
You're hurting me.

506
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:15,165
My love and loyalty to you is genuine.

507
01:03:16,445 --> 01:03:20,125
I accepted Emir Sadettin's offer
to leave the dungeon.

508
01:03:21,325 --> 01:03:26,045
But once you took me in,
I never betrayed you.

509
01:03:28,445 --> 01:03:29,965
I loved you, Kritos.

510
01:03:30,325 --> 01:03:32,005
I really did.

511
01:03:32,365 --> 01:03:33,725
You're my everything.

512
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:36,285
You lie! You will die!

513
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:46,485
You love me so much you want to kill me.

514
01:03:58,725 --> 01:03:59,605
So...

515
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:04,445
the Traveler was right.

516
01:04:07,165 --> 01:04:08,805
Now it's Ares' turn.

517
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:11,685
I mean...

518
01:04:12,645 --> 01:04:13,805
Ahmet's turn.

519
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,285
-<i>Selamunaleykum.</i>
-<i>Aleykumselamun</i>, my bey.

520
01:04:40,365 --> 01:04:41,525
Brother Ahmet.

521
01:04:46,365 --> 01:04:47,765
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

522
01:04:48,005 --> 01:04:49,205
-Come.
-Thanks.

523
01:04:53,965 --> 01:04:55,405
Come on, men.

524
01:05:01,165 --> 01:05:03,245
I hope you have good news, Ahmet.

525
01:05:03,605 --> 01:05:06,125
I do, my bey. I have great news for you.

526
01:05:06,765 --> 01:05:07,845
Speak.

527
01:05:07,925 --> 01:05:11,405
Did Governor Kritos decide
to conquer Karacahisar Castle?

528
01:05:11,485 --> 01:05:12,645
If only.

529
01:05:12,805 --> 01:05:14,085
That would make things easy.

530
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:15,285
Indeed.

531
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:17,325
But you were right, Ertuğrul Bey.

532
01:05:18,445 --> 01:05:22,805
Once Sultan Gıyaseddin ensured stability
in the Seljuk State,

533
01:05:23,765 --> 01:05:25,765
Nicaea didn't send the army.

534
01:05:27,565 --> 01:05:29,725
I had hoped for a fight.

535
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:34,085
I wanted to go after the infidels.

536
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:38,085
Patience, Turgut.

537
01:05:39,885 --> 01:05:41,685
The governor won't stand idle.

538
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:46,245
He'll do everything to prevent us
from getting to Söğüt.

539
01:05:47,685 --> 01:05:49,645
He won't wait long.

540
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:52,285
He asked me to get the men ready.

541
01:05:56,325 --> 01:05:59,525
The governor's soldiers
are easy prey for us.

542
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:04,565
But for the wealth and happiness
of the people

543
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,445
in my land,

544
01:06:07,085 --> 01:06:09,125
I will postpone the migration for now.

545
01:06:11,965 --> 01:06:14,085
If the governor acts,
it will be a bloodbath.

546
01:06:16,605 --> 01:06:18,245
It will hurt trade too.

547
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:22,405
Unfortunately.

548
01:06:23,725 --> 01:06:26,245
There are many innocents,
Muslim and non-Muslim.

549
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:29,565
The governor's ambition and revenge
will hurt them.

550
01:06:31,045 --> 01:06:34,725
I fear for the order
you've managed to establish.

551
01:06:38,045 --> 01:06:39,165
My bey...

552
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,845
they won't dare attack the castle.

553
01:06:43,645 --> 01:06:47,685
If you allow it, I wish to stand guard
outside with my men.

554
01:06:49,245 --> 01:06:53,565
We can send a message to Governor Kritos
without scaring the people.

555
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:56,925
Good idea, Günalp Bey.

556
01:06:57,965 --> 01:06:59,365
Do that.

557
01:07:00,325 --> 01:07:02,605
The castle must be guarded
by enough men at all times.

558
01:07:04,565 --> 01:07:06,645
We'll send alps to the castle.

559
01:07:08,845 --> 01:07:12,525
Close the gates after sundown
for security.

560
01:07:12,645 --> 01:07:13,885
As you wish.

561
01:07:15,405 --> 01:07:17,645
We'll use the governor's woman, Marya...

562
01:07:19,365 --> 01:07:21,125
and plot against him, Ahmet.

563
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:23,925
If we kill the governor,

564
01:07:24,245 --> 01:07:26,005
the fire of his vengeance will dissipate.

565
01:07:26,445 --> 01:07:28,045
As you order.

566
01:07:28,365 --> 01:07:32,365
But... there are other reasons why
the emperor doesn't want peace.

567
01:07:34,165 --> 01:07:37,325
Make sure that the emperor
won't send another army.

568
01:07:38,365 --> 01:07:39,485
Why?

569
01:07:40,045 --> 01:07:41,125
Mongols.

570
01:07:48,045 --> 01:07:53,365
We know that Ögedei
and his armies aim for the south,

571
01:07:54,285 --> 01:07:57,405
the fertile lands
of the Euphrates and Tigris.

572
01:07:58,565 --> 01:08:00,365
I heard in Nicaea that...

573
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:04,165
Ögedei is ready to invade Anatolia.

574
01:08:05,205 --> 01:08:07,685
His army is led by his trusted commander.

575
01:08:09,325 --> 01:08:11,965
If the Sultan makes a mistake
or shows weakness,

576
01:08:12,165 --> 01:08:16,445
they'll invade Anatolia and spill blood.
Everyone will be killed.

577
01:08:16,645 --> 01:08:18,805
They won't stop until Constantinople.

578
01:08:26,325 --> 01:08:29,245
Who is leading the invasion, Ahmet?

579
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,205
A man called Noyan, I've heard.

580
01:13:05,325 --> 01:13:10,885
Ertuğrul, I've been reborn from my ashes
so I might kill you and your bloodline.

581
01:13:23,685 --> 01:13:24,965
Alangoya.

582
01:13:26,165 --> 01:13:27,325
Yes, Brother.

583
01:13:36,885 --> 01:13:39,605
I trained you for this.

584
01:13:42,445 --> 01:13:44,565
Come here, my brave sister.

585
01:13:55,445 --> 01:13:57,885
Tell me what you've done.

586
01:13:59,245 --> 01:14:01,165
I did my duty.

587
01:14:02,765 --> 01:14:05,245
-Did you see Ertuğrul?
-I did.

588
01:14:08,045 --> 01:14:09,045
Tell me.

589
01:14:10,165 --> 01:14:15,485
I exploited his sense of honesty
and honor and got a place at his bazaar.

590
01:14:17,205 --> 01:14:18,605
He trusts me now.

591
01:14:19,485 --> 01:14:23,365
I even met his wife and mother.

592
01:14:24,605 --> 01:14:28,605
My savage hawk. Well done.

593
01:14:32,445 --> 01:14:35,725
You proved once again
that you're the pride of this empire.

594
01:14:38,925 --> 01:14:44,445
I've made many sacrifices to the spirits
for giving me such a sister.

595
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:52,325
From now on, you'll be able to offer them
the blood and meat of the Turks.

596
01:14:59,365 --> 01:15:00,405
My comrades...

597
01:15:07,885 --> 01:15:11,045
My comrades died
so that you'd be able

598
01:15:11,725 --> 01:15:12,925
to seduce Ertuğrul.

599
01:15:15,725 --> 01:15:19,045
May the spirits protect them
from Erlik Khan's wrath.

600
01:15:20,445 --> 01:15:22,085
May their paths be clear.

601
01:15:26,925 --> 01:15:30,405
Now, let's do our duty.

602
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:46,605
What are you saying?
Where did Noyan come from?

603
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:54,405
He died. My bey,
that demon died. We saw it.

604
01:15:57,525 --> 01:15:59,205
Do you know that devil?

605
01:16:04,045 --> 01:16:05,205
I do, Ahmet.

606
01:16:07,365 --> 01:16:08,965
I know him well.

607
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:15,885
<i>Welcome to Noyan's hell, Ertuğrul.</i>

608
01:16:16,005 --> 01:16:17,245
<i>So, you're Noyan.</i>

609
01:16:18,005 --> 01:16:20,085
The hellhound himself!

610
01:17:40,485 --> 01:17:41,485
Brother?

611
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:46,285
Brother?

612
01:17:46,565 --> 01:17:48,125
Brother, brother!

613
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:51,005
Hold on. You'll be fine, Brother.

614
01:17:51,445 --> 01:17:52,485
My bey.

615
01:17:54,685 --> 01:17:57,485
How can that be? We all saw it.

616
01:17:58,725 --> 01:18:01,645
When my brother Sungur was injured,
we panicked

617
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,565
and set off to take him home.

618
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:09,805
We just left Noyan's body there.

619
01:18:10,525 --> 01:18:13,205
My bey. You destroyed Noyan.

620
01:18:13,325 --> 01:18:15,085
You slashed him all over.

621
01:18:15,205 --> 01:18:17,605
That scum was covered in blood.

622
01:18:18,045 --> 01:18:19,325
I know, Bamsi, I know.

623
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:25,445
But he's alive.

624
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:30,445
That means that dog...

625
01:18:31,965 --> 01:18:33,365
isn't after Anatolia.

626
01:18:34,285 --> 01:18:36,125
{\an8}He'll be after you, my bey.

627
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:57,450
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

628
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:04,930
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

629
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:13,050
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

630
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:17,810
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

631
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:23,530
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

632
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:29,290
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

633
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:54,890
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

634
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:17,770
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

635
01:20:21,103 --> 01:20:23,103
For Cayan in the upper worlds.

636
01:20:23,223 --> 01:20:25,303
Cayan! Cayan! Cayan!

637
01:20:25,423 --> 01:20:29,143
For the sons and daughters of Erlik Khan
in the underworld!

638
01:20:29,223 --> 01:20:32,503
Erlik Khan!

639
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:35,183
For the love of <i>Munci </i>and <i>Musval!</i>

640
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:38,263
<i>-Munci! Musval!</i>
-Death!

641
01:20:41,023 --> 01:20:46,263
<i>Munci, Musval!</i>

642
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:57,103
My brave warriors who would even make love
until death for Genghis Khan.

643
01:20:57,943 --> 01:21:00,103
Be the nightmare of the Kayis.

644
01:21:00,183 --> 01:21:02,983
Fall onto them like death.

645
01:21:03,343 --> 01:21:06,423
For the love of <i>Munci, Musval!</i>

646
01:21:06,503 --> 01:21:09,543
<i>Munci! Musval!</i>

647
01:21:09,623 --> 01:21:13,303
<i>Munci! Musval!</i>

648
01:21:13,543 --> 01:21:19,623
We are the vanguard,
and we are here to raid these lands.

649
01:21:20,063 --> 01:21:25,183
We will flow steadily but strongly,
like the rivers of Seyhun and Ceyhun,

650
01:21:25,303 --> 01:21:28,143
and open up a path for our army.

651
01:21:28,423 --> 01:21:31,503
We'll drink Turkish blood and go crazy.

652
01:21:36,903 --> 01:21:38,823
Remember.

653
01:21:39,143 --> 01:21:44,663
We are facing a brave
and honorable warrior.

654
01:21:44,903 --> 01:21:48,063
An undefeated warrior. Ertugrul.

655
01:21:48,143 --> 01:21:53,543
Ertugrul! Ertugrul! Ertugrul!

656
01:21:55,383 --> 01:22:00,183
The smartest and bravest warrior
of the Turks.

657
01:22:00,823 --> 01:22:07,503
We're not here to openly challenge him
or his<i> alps </i>to open combat,

658
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:10,543
we are here to kill their souls,

659
01:22:10,703 --> 01:22:15,623
to lock their souls in the hell
of Erlik Khan.

660
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:18,023
We are here to put an end
to the state of the Seljuks.

661
01:22:26,463 --> 01:22:29,143
For the love of <i>Munci </i>and <i>Musval!</i>

662
01:22:31,543 --> 01:22:35,663
May Tengri feel the sweat
of our brave warriors.

663
01:22:36,223 --> 01:22:40,743
May the mountain of steel fill
with the awe of the spirits.

664
01:22:40,823 --> 01:22:46,903
May our warriors' courage reach the skies.
May their spirits

665
01:22:47,063 --> 01:22:50,823
enlighten the whole world.

666
01:22:50,983 --> 01:22:54,743
Oh, the moon and the sun!

667
01:22:54,823 --> 01:22:58,623
Blessed trees decorated with rags!

668
01:22:58,703 --> 01:23:01,983
The holy beech tree with leaves!

669
01:23:02,543 --> 01:23:06,263
Owner of the blazing flames, Ak Yayik!

670
01:23:11,623 --> 01:23:15,823
Oh, holy Tengri!

671
01:23:23,423 --> 01:23:28,943
The water of life with a thousand ears!
The lord in the skies with cloudy eyes!

672
01:23:29,023 --> 01:23:31,903
The gentleman with icy feet!

673
01:23:32,023 --> 01:23:36,503
Clouds and horses, Lord!

674
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:39,943
Please accept them
to the world of spirits.

675
01:24:14,903 --> 01:24:21,823
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

676
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:27,863
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

677
01:24:36,903 --> 01:24:40,743
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

678
01:24:46,663 --> 01:24:48,743
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

679
01:24:52,783 --> 01:24:54,463
They are far away from us, my <i>bey.</i>

680
01:24:54,863 --> 01:24:57,423
They can't harm us from this distance

681
01:24:58,263 --> 01:25:02,663
unless the Mongols decide
to invade our state.

682
01:25:08,823 --> 01:25:10,703
No, Gunalp <i>Bey.</i>

683
01:25:11,543 --> 01:25:15,343
If the task to invade our country
has been given to Noyan...

684
01:25:18,223 --> 01:25:22,663
at first, he will try to surround us
from within.

685
01:25:22,903 --> 01:25:25,703
He will probably place men everywhere,

686
01:25:25,783 --> 01:25:29,143
including our tribes and even the palace.

687
01:25:33,263 --> 01:25:36,423
His hatred towards me is so immense...

688
01:25:38,223 --> 01:25:40,823
that if let inside the western borders,

689
01:25:42,063 --> 01:25:44,983
he will not stop coming after me,

690
01:25:45,463 --> 01:25:49,223
even if I go to the end of the world.

691
01:25:56,343 --> 01:26:02,423
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

692
01:26:10,503 --> 01:26:17,103
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

693
01:26:26,543 --> 01:26:30,063
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

694
01:26:30,223 --> 01:26:33,263
I've been resurrected
from the ashes, Ertugrul.

695
01:26:33,463 --> 01:26:39,863
I'm back to strike fear and despair
in your heart.

696
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:46,823
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

697
01:26:51,703 --> 01:26:56,943
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

698
01:27:08,943 --> 01:27:14,103
Noyan! Noyan! Noyan!

699
01:27:36,063 --> 01:27:38,263
Push, Lady Halime.

700
01:27:39,743 --> 01:27:41,423
-Mother.
-Huh?

701
01:27:41,543 --> 01:27:44,343
I'm so thirsty. Please give me some water.

702
01:27:44,423 --> 01:27:47,943
Of course. Okay, my girl.
Give her some water.

703
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:54,383
Here, my girl.

704
01:27:59,223 --> 01:28:01,223
Give it here.

705
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:11,703
Just a little harder, my girl.

706
01:28:11,863 --> 01:28:14,023
God, please help her.

707
01:28:16,703 --> 01:28:19,143
Balcicek, did you let Artuk <i>Bey </i>know
about the situation?

708
01:28:19,223 --> 01:28:21,623
We did, Mother Hayme.
He must be on his way.

709
01:28:24,943 --> 01:28:27,103
Come on, hang in there.

710
01:28:27,223 --> 01:28:30,223
With God's permission, you'll have
a beautiful, healthy baby.

711
01:28:30,303 --> 01:28:31,583
Come on.

712
01:28:53,943 --> 01:28:57,023
Governor, come. Take a seat.

713
01:28:58,263 --> 01:28:59,863
Welcome.

714
01:29:03,303 --> 01:29:04,703
Go ahead, drink it.

715
01:29:04,783 --> 01:29:07,423
I don't want to drink now, stranger.

716
01:29:08,463 --> 01:29:11,943
Come on, drink it.
It revives the faded spirits.

717
01:29:21,503 --> 01:29:26,103
What kind of wine is this?
It looks like blood.

718
01:29:29,743 --> 01:29:33,463
What I poured into your glass is not wine,
it's blood.

719
01:29:43,623 --> 01:29:45,783
I missed the taste of Turkish blood.

720
01:29:47,863 --> 01:29:51,383
Come on, drink it. It'll help you
to forget about your dead son.

721
01:29:52,783 --> 01:29:54,263
I won't drink it.

722
01:29:59,103 --> 01:30:03,023
I'm here to tell you that you were right.

723
01:30:04,183 --> 01:30:09,063
Maria accepted that she was working
under the commands of Sadettin.

724
01:30:10,303 --> 01:30:12,863
So, you finally believe me, huh?

725
01:30:13,343 --> 01:30:16,103
Now it's that bastard Ares' turn,
who changed his name to Ahmet.

726
01:30:28,743 --> 01:30:31,143
Don't you touch Ares.

727
01:30:31,943 --> 01:30:34,143
What is on your mind, traveler?

728
01:30:34,623 --> 01:30:38,783
Ares will give me Ertugrul
and he will give you his life.

729
01:30:40,183 --> 01:30:41,863
Do you understand?

730
01:30:45,103 --> 01:30:48,903
Good. We will be good partners.

731
01:30:51,943 --> 01:30:55,103
But first, tell me who you are.

732
01:30:57,183 --> 01:31:00,223
I told you. I'm merely a traveler.

733
01:31:00,383 --> 01:31:04,663
I'll be the closest friend
you have ever had or will have.

734
01:31:07,983 --> 01:31:11,823
I'm a traveler who is on the hunt
for Ertugrul.

735
01:31:15,263 --> 01:31:18,863
You'll learn more when I have him
in my grip.

736
01:31:21,343 --> 01:31:24,303
Come on, governor. Drink it. Huh?

737
01:31:50,423 --> 01:31:51,863
Father!

738
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:54,263
My brother is coming.

739
01:31:54,423 --> 01:31:57,543
Yes, son. Yes, he is.

740
01:31:57,663 --> 01:31:59,023
How is your mother?

741
01:31:59,103 --> 01:32:02,143
Grandmother and the nurses
are taking care of her.

742
01:32:02,223 --> 01:32:03,943
Very well.

743
01:32:04,623 --> 01:32:07,703
You'll be responsible for your brother
once he arrives, right?

744
01:32:07,783 --> 01:32:11,503
Yes, Father. I'll take care of him.

745
01:32:11,623 --> 01:32:14,983
I will even train him with swords
once he is grown up.

746
01:32:15,103 --> 01:32:18,543
Very well, my brave son.

747
01:32:24,103 --> 01:32:25,463
Mother.

748
01:32:26,823 --> 01:32:28,103
Son.

749
01:32:30,983 --> 01:32:36,223
-How is Halime?
-She is fine, son. Don't worry.

750
01:32:37,943 --> 01:32:41,263
Things are going smoothly.

751
01:32:41,503 --> 01:32:43,063
Thank God, Mother.

752
01:32:43,663 --> 01:32:45,263
Thank God.

753
01:32:45,983 --> 01:32:47,983
I am unable to contain myself, Mother.

754
01:32:48,543 --> 01:32:50,263
I know, Son.

755
01:32:50,343 --> 01:32:52,143
Just be patient a little longer.

756
01:32:53,223 --> 01:32:55,783
I'll go help them now.

757
01:32:56,103 --> 01:33:00,983
Pray to hold
a healthy baby in your arms.

758
01:33:01,063 --> 01:33:03,223
I will, Mother.

759
01:33:16,903 --> 01:33:20,583
Father, is the baby a girl or a boy?

760
01:33:23,183 --> 01:33:24,863
Come here, Son.

761
01:33:30,783 --> 01:33:33,423
It will be whatever God wants it to be.

762
01:33:34,863 --> 01:33:38,663
But, we had received the good news
of Osman's arrival.

763
01:33:39,263 --> 01:33:45,143
Your mother, grandmother and I
saw him in our dreams.

764
01:33:46,943 --> 01:33:49,423
But it's up to Allah, Son.

765
01:33:49,503 --> 01:33:51,783
Once the baby is here,

766
01:33:51,903 --> 01:33:55,423
I can protect it if it is a girl.

767
01:33:55,983 --> 01:33:58,383
Of course, you can, Son.

768
01:33:58,463 --> 01:34:01,183
My brave son.

769
01:34:01,863 --> 01:34:04,543
You are the glorious Gunduz <i>Alp.</i>

770
01:34:06,023 --> 01:34:10,183
Father, how did you meet with my mother?

771
01:34:10,263 --> 01:34:13,743
Why do you call her "my gazelle"?

772
01:34:15,343 --> 01:34:18,623
I saw your mother
thanks to a gazelle, Gunduz.

773
01:34:25,303 --> 01:34:27,663
<i>-Father!</i>
<i>-Halime!</i>

774
01:34:33,263 --> 01:34:34,863
Oh, God!

775
01:34:44,783 --> 01:34:47,063
Let's get out of here quickly.

776
01:34:48,503 --> 01:34:51,983
You should go.
We can take care of ourselves.

777
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:56,023
-It's easy to handle a bunch of templars.
-Let's see how he will handle this.

778
01:34:56,343 --> 01:35:00,263
-Now, he is in trouble.
-He definitely is.

779
01:35:00,343 --> 01:35:03,423
-What can you do as a woman on your own?
-I said we wouldn't come.

780
01:35:03,623 --> 01:35:05,783
We owe you our lives.

781
01:35:05,863 --> 01:35:09,103
And we will repay you one day.
Tell me your name.

782
01:35:09,343 --> 01:35:10,983
Ertugrul, from the Kayi tribe.

783
01:35:12,703 --> 01:35:14,263
As you wish.

784
01:35:14,663 --> 01:35:18,023
May God help you. Farewell.

785
01:35:19,423 --> 01:35:22,183
Let's go with them, Sister.

786
01:35:22,263 --> 01:35:24,223
Is your tribe far from here?

787
01:35:28,703 --> 01:35:32,823
Is that why you call her "my gazelle"?

788
01:35:33,503 --> 01:35:35,063
Yes, Son.

789
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:37,943
That's why.

790
01:35:38,063 --> 01:35:40,943
Your mother is as delicate as a gazelle.

791
01:35:42,943 --> 01:35:46,063
And she has the eyes of a gazelle.

792
01:35:55,143 --> 01:35:58,183
Should I go and see Mother?

793
01:35:58,343 --> 01:36:00,503
I can encourage her.

794
01:36:07,663 --> 01:36:09,743
Come on, now.

795
01:36:10,223 --> 01:36:12,223
Men don't enter the birth room.

796
01:36:13,383 --> 01:36:16,063
We'll wait for your brother to come.

797
01:36:24,903 --> 01:36:27,343
Ertugrul is here.

798
01:36:27,423 --> 01:36:30,903
He awaits the good news
of his baby. Come on, my beautiful girl.

799
01:36:30,983 --> 01:36:33,543
-Is Ertugrul here?
-Yes, he is.

800
01:36:35,223 --> 01:36:38,223
Come on, Lady Halime. Push.

801
01:36:41,783 --> 01:36:44,983
-<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim</i>.
-Just a little bit more.

802
01:36:51,183 --> 01:36:54,863
The baby is here!

803
01:36:54,943 --> 01:36:58,023
The baby is here!

804
01:37:04,423 --> 01:37:07,623
Father, it's the sound of my brother!

805
01:37:21,383 --> 01:37:24,983
That's right, son. It's your brother.

806
01:37:27,143 --> 01:37:29,783
Thank God.

807
01:37:30,343 --> 01:37:33,783
Thank God a thousand times.

808
01:37:44,943 --> 01:37:49,623
Oh, thank God.

809
01:37:49,983 --> 01:37:51,783
Praise to God.

810
01:37:53,503 --> 01:37:57,783
You have had a very healthy baby boy,
Lady Halime.

811
01:38:13,623 --> 01:38:16,743
Oh, my beautiful boy.

812
01:38:17,743 --> 01:38:19,583
He smells like heaven.

813
01:38:20,823 --> 01:38:23,903
A thousand thanks to God.

814
01:38:26,223 --> 01:38:29,703
May God bless your life.

815
01:38:29,943 --> 01:38:32,103
He looks so healthy.

816
01:38:33,223 --> 01:38:34,503
Mother.

817
01:38:35,503 --> 01:38:36,743
My girl.

818
01:38:36,823 --> 01:38:39,703
-My Osman.
-Osman.

819
01:38:44,983 --> 01:38:48,343
-Mother.
-Here, take our Osman.

820
01:38:49,783 --> 01:38:51,263
My Osman.

821
01:39:00,783 --> 01:39:03,223
The news of his arrival came before him.

822
01:39:05,223 --> 01:39:07,743
I would die for you.

823
01:39:08,423 --> 01:39:13,143
You've brought happiness to our tent
and our tribe, my lion.

824
01:39:14,263 --> 01:39:15,903
My baby.

825
01:39:17,183 --> 01:39:21,223
What a beautiful baby he is, Mother.

826
01:39:24,623 --> 01:39:29,983
God, thank you so much for letting me

827
01:39:30,103 --> 01:39:32,423
experience such a beautiful moment.

828
01:39:37,663 --> 01:39:41,823
May God bless his tribe
and his life, Lady Halime.

829
01:39:42,223 --> 01:39:45,303
May God gift him
with beautiful experiences.

830
01:39:45,903 --> 01:39:47,183
Amen.

831
01:39:47,383 --> 01:39:50,743
Ladies, God bless you, too.

832
01:39:51,303 --> 01:39:53,503
Thank you, ladies.

833
01:39:53,983 --> 01:39:55,623
Excuse us.

834
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:16,263
My girl?

835
01:40:16,343 --> 01:40:17,583
Are you okay?

836
01:40:19,743 --> 01:40:21,343
I'm fine, Mother.

837
01:40:22,463 --> 01:40:25,943
Give the news to Ertugrul.

838
01:40:26,623 --> 01:40:28,663
Take Osman to him.

839
01:40:33,063 --> 01:40:37,303
-My girl, are you okay?
-I'm fine, Mother. Take Osman.

840
01:40:38,903 --> 01:40:42,503
Okay. Try and rest, okay?

841
01:41:17,223 --> 01:41:18,463
Mother.

842
01:41:19,943 --> 01:41:22,063
It's a boy, my son.

843
01:41:25,983 --> 01:41:28,303
Our Osman is here.

844
01:41:34,263 --> 01:41:36,263
Oh, my.

845
01:41:43,983 --> 01:41:45,863
Oh, my.

846
01:41:53,663 --> 01:41:55,423
My Osman.

847
01:42:00,343 --> 01:42:02,143
My brave son.

848
01:42:03,983 --> 01:42:09,783
Thank God for giving us our visions
and delivering you.

849
01:42:10,023 --> 01:42:11,543
Father.

850
01:42:11,943 --> 01:42:17,023
Your dreams came true. Osman is here.
My brother.

851
01:42:20,703 --> 01:42:24,623
Mother. Tell me, how is my Halime?

852
01:42:26,063 --> 01:42:32,303
She is fine, Son. She will be better
once she rests a little more.

853
01:42:33,823 --> 01:42:36,623
Hopefully so.

854
01:42:44,943 --> 01:42:46,263
My <i>bey.</i>

855
01:42:46,703 --> 01:42:48,303
Come, Artuk <i>Bey.</i>

856
01:42:53,263 --> 01:42:57,063
Welcome, Artuk <i>Bey</i>.
Our Osman is here<i>.</i>

857
01:42:57,183 --> 01:42:59,303
What a beautiful child.

858
01:43:00,423 --> 01:43:06,183
He rose upon our tribe like the sun.

859
01:43:06,303 --> 01:43:08,063
May God bless him, my <i>bey.</i>

860
01:43:08,143 --> 01:43:11,823
May God make him happy both
in this life and in the afterlife.

861
01:43:11,943 --> 01:43:14,023
Amen.

862
01:43:16,983 --> 01:43:18,423
Lady Hayme.

863
01:43:19,183 --> 01:43:21,743
How is Lady Halime?

864
01:43:22,223 --> 01:43:24,063
She is fine, Artuk <i>Bey.</i>

865
01:43:24,383 --> 01:43:26,503
She is resting.

866
01:43:29,823 --> 01:43:33,623
I wanted you to be here just in case.

867
01:43:37,103 --> 01:43:38,503
Of course.

868
01:43:39,823 --> 01:43:41,223
My <i>bey...</i>

869
01:43:41,903 --> 01:43:45,503
whisper Osman's name to his ears.

870
01:43:47,663 --> 01:43:49,823
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

871
01:43:51,183 --> 01:43:53,823
<i>Ertugrul </i>Bey<i>, may I come in?</i>

872
01:43:54,023 --> 01:43:55,503
Please come in.

873
01:43:59,703 --> 01:44:03,023
<i>-Selamunaleykum.</i>
<i>-Aleykumselam.</i>

874
01:44:05,983 --> 01:44:09,983
Finally, you have your baby,
my Ertugrul <i>Bey.</i>

875
01:44:11,503 --> 01:44:14,263
May God bless his fortune.

876
01:44:14,783 --> 01:44:18,503
May he be victorious, just like you.

877
01:44:18,623 --> 01:44:20,823
-Amen.
-Amen.

878
01:44:23,983 --> 01:44:27,143
It's the will of my father, Suleyman Shah.

879
01:44:27,783 --> 01:44:30,503
He wanted his name to be Osman.

880
01:44:31,543 --> 01:44:36,143
I'd like you to be the whisperer
of his name, if you would be so kind.

881
01:44:47,223 --> 01:44:52,863
<i>Allahuakbar.</i>

882
01:44:53,903 --> 01:44:58,943
I bear witness
that there is no God but Allah

883
01:44:59,263 --> 01:45:05,343
and that Muhammad is his messenger.

884
01:45:05,783 --> 01:45:09,503
Come to prayer,

885
01:45:09,703 --> 01:45:13,223
come to salvation.

886
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:17,903
Allahuakbar.

887
01:45:18,743 --> 01:45:20,943
There is no God but Allah.

888
01:45:24,263 --> 01:45:27,183
Your name is Osman.

889
01:45:27,863 --> 01:45:34,143
Your name is Osman.

890
01:45:37,063 --> 01:45:40,623
Your grandfather gave you your name.

891
01:45:41,063 --> 01:45:43,423
May God give you a blessed life.

892
01:45:43,503 --> 01:45:45,063
Amen.

893
01:45:45,703 --> 01:45:49,463
Let it be known to the angels in the skies
and the subjects on Earth,

894
01:45:50,343 --> 01:45:52,143
your name is Osman.

895
01:45:55,383 --> 01:45:58,023
May God give you a good fortune.

896
01:45:58,583 --> 01:46:04,983
May you live a beautiful life and prosper.

897
01:46:05,583 --> 01:46:07,583
May you be a subject to Allah,

898
01:46:07,743 --> 01:46:11,423
a good follower of our prophet,

899
01:46:12,223 --> 01:46:16,143
and a servant to the world of Islam.

900
01:46:18,063 --> 01:46:20,423
May you be glorious and victorious.

901
01:46:20,703 --> 01:46:22,743
-Amen.
-Amen.

902
01:46:26,623 --> 01:46:28,223
Thank you very much.

903
01:46:32,543 --> 01:46:34,903
Now, excuse me.

904
01:46:45,343 --> 01:46:49,743
Come on, now.

905
01:47:13,823 --> 01:47:15,303
Artuk <i>Bey.</i>

906
01:47:20,503 --> 01:47:22,623
I didn't want to startle Ertugrul,

907
01:47:22,743 --> 01:47:28,503
but Halime is holding her chest
and she has difficulty breathing.

908
01:47:31,023 --> 01:47:32,983
It'd be better for you to be here...

909
01:47:33,583 --> 01:47:35,863
just in case.

910
01:47:36,543 --> 01:47:37,863
Of course.

911
01:47:50,823 --> 01:47:52,103
My Halime.

912
01:47:54,383 --> 01:47:58,783
My beloved.

913
01:48:01,303 --> 01:48:04,863
Mother of my three children.

914
01:48:07,143 --> 01:48:10,783
Our son Osman, whose news of arrival

915
01:48:10,863 --> 01:48:15,503
was given by Suleyman Shah, is here.

916
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:18,023
<i>Your son, Osman...</i>

917
01:48:19,903 --> 01:48:26,303
<i>He will change our bad fortune</i>
<i>and make these lands a base for Oguz.</i>

918
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:34,463
Let us take our bows and shields
with the oaths of my Oguz ancestors.

919
01:48:34,543 --> 01:48:36,943
May this be a signature for us.

920
01:48:37,143 --> 01:48:40,263
May we create a jungle
from our iron spears.

921
01:48:41,823 --> 01:48:45,103
Many more seas and rivers.

922
01:48:47,743 --> 01:48:51,023
May the sky be our tent
and the sun be our flag.

923
01:48:51,103 --> 01:48:56,983
<i>Allahuakbar!</i>

924
01:48:57,063 --> 01:49:03,423
<i>Allahuakbar!</i>

925
01:49:11,783 --> 01:49:13,303
My Halime.

926
01:49:13,663 --> 01:49:19,063
We've seen the news of Osman's arrival
in many blessed dreams.

927
01:49:19,983 --> 01:49:24,023
And God gave him to us in the spring time.

928
01:49:25,983 --> 01:49:28,423
What a blessed child this is.

929
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:31,223
What a blessed baby this is.

930
01:49:31,903 --> 01:49:34,503
He will bring joy and happiness

931
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:37,223
to our tribe and tent.

932
01:49:48,023 --> 01:49:49,863
Oh, Son!

933
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:51,983
Fine son!

934
01:49:52,303 --> 01:49:53,823
Blessed son!

935
01:49:56,303 --> 01:50:02,663
May your only guidance be the holy Qur'an
and the deeds of our prophet.

936
01:50:05,623 --> 01:50:09,343
May your traditions be
that of your Oguz ancestors'.

937
01:50:10,823 --> 01:50:15,223
May your sword carry justice and wisdom
just like the sword of Zulfiqar,

938
01:50:15,303 --> 01:50:18,103
and take it
to the four corners of the world.

939
01:50:19,343 --> 01:50:21,823
Have such a great purpose...

940
01:50:22,743 --> 01:50:25,783
so, it shall make the world look small.

941
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:28,023
Oh, Son!

942
01:50:28,623 --> 01:50:30,023
Fine son!

943
01:50:30,743 --> 01:50:35,103
Be a worthy person of your mother's milk
and your ancestors' blood.

944
01:50:37,303 --> 01:50:41,183
May you always be victorious.

945
01:50:41,503 --> 01:50:45,663
May your flag never drop in your battles.

946
01:50:47,703 --> 01:50:50,983
May you never give in to despair.

947
01:50:53,223 --> 01:50:59,383
We have prayed so much for you,

948
01:50:59,503 --> 01:51:04,503
may God gather them all and accept them
for the sake of our prophet.

949
01:51:55,503 --> 01:51:59,663
We have been waiting so long
for this news.

950
01:51:59,863 --> 01:52:02,463
Osman came in a spring time,

951
01:52:03,303 --> 01:52:05,623
which will bring more happiness
to our tribe.

952
01:52:05,743 --> 01:52:08,783
Then, we will celebrate his arrival
with another fine festival.

953
01:52:08,863 --> 01:52:12,223
Of course, Brother. For sure.

954
01:52:13,103 --> 01:52:16,063
I shall let the <i>beys </i>of Cavdar know
right away.

955
01:52:17,543 --> 01:52:19,263
They will come and visit.

956
01:52:21,223 --> 01:52:25,343
Hopefully, Osman's arrival
will bring good fortune to our tribes.

957
01:52:25,463 --> 01:52:27,983
Hopefully so.

958
01:52:28,103 --> 01:52:29,663
Hopefully.

959
01:52:53,783 --> 01:52:55,343
Ertugrul.

960
01:52:55,623 --> 01:52:57,103
My Halime.

961
01:53:03,663 --> 01:53:05,103
My Osman.

962
01:53:12,143 --> 01:53:14,543
Our Osman is here, my Halime.

963
01:53:14,863 --> 01:53:16,423
Thank God.

964
01:53:21,623 --> 01:53:23,623
Are you okay, my Halime?

965
01:53:26,223 --> 01:53:27,543
I'm okay.

966
01:53:38,343 --> 01:53:42,343
Hush.

967
01:53:47,663 --> 01:53:50,463
Now that I gave birth
to our Osman safe and sound,

968
01:53:51,423 --> 01:53:54,343
held him in our tent...

969
01:53:57,503 --> 01:54:01,023
and smelled his heavenly smell...

970
01:54:05,063 --> 01:54:07,543
I feel like the world is mine.

971
01:54:07,663 --> 01:54:09,663
My gazelle eyed wife...

972
01:54:10,343 --> 01:54:12,623
mother of my three children.

973
01:54:15,823 --> 01:54:21,143
You made me feel like the world was mine
when you gave birth to my children.

974
01:54:25,943 --> 01:54:30,103
Long ago,
because of the clashes for the throne,

975
01:54:30,183 --> 01:54:34,423
my father and siblings and I
suffered very much.

976
01:54:36,183 --> 01:54:39,623
There was always trouble, Ertugrul.

977
01:54:42,143 --> 01:54:44,103
I told myself,

978
01:54:44,223 --> 01:54:49,383
"Halime, it seems
you'll never sleep peacefully."

979
01:54:53,143 --> 01:54:56,823
But my God, who rewards the patience,

980
01:54:57,743 --> 01:55:00,543
has also rewarded my patience.

981
01:55:05,783 --> 01:55:09,463
What a beautiful fortune I have

982
01:55:09,543 --> 01:55:15,343
to be your beloved wife
and your children's mother.

983
01:55:24,103 --> 01:55:28,783
A thousand thanks to God
who led me to you while chasing a gazelle.

984
01:55:33,903 --> 01:55:36,863
You waited for me when I went to battle.

985
01:55:42,703 --> 01:55:44,903
You helped my tent stand strong.

986
01:55:47,303 --> 01:55:49,503
Sometimes, you lost your sleep
and appetite.

987
01:55:50,943 --> 01:55:53,663
You never stopped or rested.

988
01:55:56,383 --> 01:56:02,263
You raised my two children and gave birth
to another in all this chaos.

989
01:56:04,543 --> 01:56:08,743
-How can I pay this debt, my Halime?
-Don't say that, Ertugrul.

990
01:56:11,303 --> 01:56:14,423
I pray for you to be safe and sound.

991
01:56:15,623 --> 01:56:17,863
To be always victorious.

992
01:56:19,463 --> 01:56:23,183
To always be there to lead our tribe.

993
01:56:23,903 --> 01:56:26,103
That's all I ask for.

994
01:56:27,703 --> 01:56:29,943
All I ask of my God is...

995
01:56:30,703 --> 01:56:35,063
for you, my Gunduz, my Savci...

996
01:56:36,383 --> 01:56:37,863
my Osman...

997
01:56:39,823 --> 01:56:42,983
to be safe and sound in this world.

998
01:56:45,743 --> 01:56:48,383
We'll be safe
and sound together, my Halime.

999
01:56:51,663 --> 01:56:55,143
We'll raise our children
and see them become <i>alps.</i>

1000
01:57:00,543 --> 01:57:03,583
We'll see them become <i>beys.</i>

1001
01:57:08,543 --> 01:57:13,023
My Ertugrul, let me feed Osman
his first milk.

1002
01:57:14,303 --> 01:57:18,383
You should go back.
Many will come to celebrate, for sure.

1003
01:57:18,543 --> 01:57:21,943
Okay, my Halime. Okay.

1004
01:58:03,103 --> 01:58:06,103
<i>Oi!</i> My <i>bey!</i>

1005
01:58:06,183 --> 01:58:09,663
My <i>bey!</i>

1006
01:58:09,743 --> 01:58:12,743
May God grant him a great fortune,
my <i>bey.</i>

1007
01:58:12,823 --> 01:58:16,223
He will be a brave <i>bey</i>
just like his father, for sure.

1008
01:58:16,343 --> 01:58:19,703
Hopefully so, Bamsi. Thank you.

1009
01:58:19,783 --> 01:58:21,823
-My <i>Turgut</i>!
-My <i>bey!</i>

1010
01:58:21,943 --> 01:58:23,863
Congratulations, my <i>bey.</i>

1011
01:58:23,943 --> 01:58:27,543
-Thank you, my lion.
-May God bless his life.

1012
01:58:27,623 --> 01:58:30,303
And grant him with many victories.

1013
01:58:30,383 --> 01:58:34,023
Hopefully so, my <i>Turgut. Thank you.</i>

1014
01:58:35,983 --> 01:58:39,263
Sons, I will go see her.

1015
01:58:39,383 --> 01:58:40,783
Very well, Mother.

1016
01:58:42,543 --> 01:58:45,623
Come, brave men. Take a seat.

1017
01:58:47,223 --> 01:58:49,343
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

1018
01:58:50,623 --> 01:58:51,943
<i>Bismillah.</i>

1019
01:58:54,903 --> 01:58:56,823
It's my order, Artuk <i>Bey...</i>

1020
01:58:57,623 --> 01:59:01,103
extend the celebrations for three days
to celebrate Osman's arrival.

1021
01:59:01,183 --> 01:59:03,223
As you order, my <i>bey.</i>

1022
01:59:06,983 --> 01:59:09,463
Let the <i>beys </i>of Oguz know.

1023
01:59:10,463 --> 01:59:13,343
Invite them to the celebrations.

1024
01:59:13,463 --> 01:59:17,103
They should bring their wrestlers, my <i>bey.</i>

1025
01:59:17,183 --> 01:59:21,943
So that I can show them
the strongest wrestler is from the Kayis.

1026
01:59:22,983 --> 01:59:24,543
Then...

1027
01:59:25,583 --> 01:59:29,663
first, you are going to need
to wrestle with the wrestler of Cavdars.

1028
01:59:29,863 --> 01:59:32,503
Let's see if you can best him.

1029
01:59:32,623 --> 01:59:35,183
My Turgut <i>Bey, </i>who is he?

1030
01:59:38,463 --> 01:59:39,743
It's me.

1031
01:59:44,903 --> 01:59:47,903
So, you want to wrestle with me, huh?

1032
01:59:49,103 --> 01:59:53,783
I'd like to wrestle to honor Osman
if my <i>bey </i>allows me.

1033
01:59:53,863 --> 01:59:55,943
Of course, my brave brothers.

1034
01:59:56,023 --> 02:00:00,183
Show everyone what it means
to be valiant warriors.

1035
02:00:01,383 --> 02:00:05,903
Thank you, my <i>bey</i>.
Then, excuse us, my <i>bey.</i>

1036
02:00:06,303 --> 02:00:09,463
We'll make the preparations.

1037
02:00:09,543 --> 02:00:10,943
Very well.

1038
02:00:12,143 --> 02:00:13,743
-Thank you, my bey.
-Thank you.

1039
02:00:13,823 --> 02:00:15,343
Come on, brother.

1040
02:00:24,303 --> 02:00:25,703
My <i>bey...</i>

1041
02:00:26,263 --> 02:00:28,583
Lady Halime gave birth just a while ago.

1042
02:00:28,663 --> 02:00:32,543
It'd be better for me to stay here,
just in case.

1043
02:00:33,063 --> 02:00:34,663
Well thought, Artuk <i>Bey.</i>

1044
02:00:35,223 --> 02:00:36,543
{\an8}Stay here, just in case.

1045
02:00:53,549 --> 02:00:54,629
My Osman...

1046
02:00:56,069 --> 02:00:58,149
I fed my baby for the first time.

1047
02:01:01,109 --> 02:01:02,789
After that, I feel at ease.

1048
02:01:03,229 --> 02:01:04,749
Wait a little.

1049
02:01:05,509 --> 02:01:08,869
You'll have to breastfeed him so many
more times until he can chew meat.

1050
02:01:24,749 --> 02:01:27,389
Come here, you little lion.

1051
02:01:28,229 --> 02:01:30,989
Your grandma would die for you.

1052
02:01:41,029 --> 02:01:42,589
Oh my sweetie.

1053
02:01:43,269 --> 02:01:44,669
Oh my sweetie.

1054
02:01:45,829 --> 02:01:47,229
There.

1055
02:01:47,949 --> 02:01:49,149
Come on.

1056
02:01:53,069 --> 02:01:54,229
Come on.

1057
02:01:54,549 --> 02:01:55,829
Come on.

1058
02:01:56,389 --> 02:01:58,669
Sleep peacefully.

1059
02:02:10,669 --> 02:02:12,389
Oh my dear.

1060
02:02:16,309 --> 02:02:18,509
I had the honor of...

1061
02:02:20,269 --> 02:02:22,269
being the wife of Ertuğrul Bey...

1062
02:02:23,389 --> 02:02:26,949
and the daughter-in-law of Mother Hayme
and Süleyman Shah.

1063
02:02:29,869 --> 02:02:33,149
I had three beautiful children
for my Ertuğrul.

1064
02:02:37,949 --> 02:02:39,429
Who would think...

1065
02:02:39,869 --> 02:02:41,669
that Halime Sultan who swayed...

1066
02:02:42,349 --> 02:02:44,669
from side to side with many troubles...

1067
02:02:46,349 --> 02:02:48,349
would become the wife of...

1068
02:02:48,869 --> 02:02:53,909
the glorious Ertuğrul Bey
and give him three children?

1069
02:03:02,029 --> 02:03:03,189
My daughter...

1070
02:03:04,509 --> 02:03:07,709
My God granted you such
a beautiful destiny.

1071
02:03:08,669 --> 02:03:10,949
My God made you meet Ertuğrul...

1072
02:03:12,949 --> 02:03:15,429
you've been a daughter to us,
more than a daughter-in-law.

1073
02:03:18,789 --> 02:03:22,709
I thank my God a thousand times
for giving you to us.

1074
02:03:23,869 --> 02:03:27,429
You stood tall against many more troubles
than we did.

1075
02:03:30,309 --> 02:03:35,269
You've always been by my Ertuğrul's side.

1076
02:03:39,029 --> 02:03:40,909
May God bless you.

1077
02:03:42,589 --> 02:03:44,469
May God bless you, Mother.

1078
02:03:47,189 --> 02:03:50,469
May my Ertuğrul Bey always be
victorious in this world.

1079
02:03:51,389 --> 02:03:53,989
May God protect him from any harm.

1080
02:03:55,469 --> 02:03:58,189
May he never have
any worries in his heart.

1081
02:03:59,509 --> 02:04:01,749
May my village, my home

1082
02:04:02,789 --> 02:04:04,669
and you always feel at peace.

1083
02:04:07,429 --> 02:04:08,509
My children...

1084
02:04:09,469 --> 02:04:14,229
May they be worthy of their names,
fame,

1085
02:04:15,669 --> 02:04:19,189
their ancestors and their parents.

1086
02:04:22,429 --> 02:04:25,509
I have always fulfilled
my responsibilities...

1087
02:04:26,789 --> 02:04:29,509
towards myself and my tribe.

1088
02:04:32,629 --> 02:04:35,269
That's my only wish from God.

1089
02:04:37,869 --> 02:04:40,229
We'll be happy together.

1090
02:04:41,189 --> 02:04:45,589
We'll all see your children growing up
and becoming such brave men.

1091
02:04:46,549 --> 02:04:47,829
Who knows...

1092
02:04:49,229 --> 02:04:51,469
Maybe you'll have more children.

1093
02:04:59,349 --> 02:05:00,429
My daughter!

1094
02:05:00,669 --> 02:05:01,909
Halime!

1095
02:05:03,669 --> 02:05:05,109
Are you okay?

1096
02:05:07,549 --> 02:05:09,429
I'm fine, Mother.

1097
02:05:10,149 --> 02:05:12,269
-I'll let Artuk Bey know.
-Mother!

1098
02:05:12,789 --> 02:05:14,069
It's not necessary.

1099
02:05:14,429 --> 02:05:15,709
I'm fine.

1100
02:05:17,589 --> 02:05:19,469
I'm just tired.

1101
02:05:37,429 --> 02:05:40,189
Today, we take the first step towards
our holy mission.

1102
02:05:42,389 --> 02:05:45,669
Compared to our mission,
our lives are not important.

1103
02:05:46,669 --> 02:05:48,869
The order Ertuğrul has established
is solid.

1104
02:05:49,509 --> 02:05:50,509
However.

1105
02:05:51,829 --> 02:05:56,269
We are strong enough to destroy that.

1106
02:06:04,429 --> 02:06:06,469
May all the warrior spirits...

1107
02:06:10,149 --> 02:06:11,989
be by our side.

1108
02:06:14,429 --> 02:06:15,789
Let's pray and take an oath.

1109
02:06:26,429 --> 02:06:28,989
I swear to Tengri,
the ruler of the earth and the sky…

1110
02:06:30,709 --> 02:06:35,269
to the conqueror of the earth,
noble Genghis Khan

1111
02:06:35,349 --> 02:06:38,749
and the spirits of his warriors
that terrorized the world.

1112
02:06:39,309 --> 02:06:42,389
We'll get our revenge from our enemies
like Ertuğrul,

1113
02:06:42,869 --> 02:06:45,989
and rule the world with our holy laws.

1114
02:06:46,949 --> 02:06:52,269
I swear we'll build walls with their heads
and make it rain with their blood.

1115
02:07:57,029 --> 02:08:02,109
If we don't spill the blood of our enemy,
may Tengri drown us in our own blood.

1116
02:08:46,669 --> 02:08:49,349
You haven't slept all night, Bey.

1117
02:08:49,709 --> 02:08:52,509
You waited just because I was here.

1118
02:08:54,109 --> 02:08:56,109
Go and rest a little.

1119
02:09:01,229 --> 02:09:03,309
I can't, Artuk Bey.

1120
02:09:05,869 --> 02:09:07,589
I want Halime to wake up first.

1121
02:09:08,589 --> 02:09:09,989
Then I'll rest.

1122
02:09:13,589 --> 02:09:15,029
Mother, did my Halime wake up?

1123
02:09:15,709 --> 02:09:17,229
She should wake up soon, son.

1124
02:09:18,509 --> 02:09:20,629
I'll make some food for Halime.

1125
02:09:21,269 --> 02:09:22,549
Thank you, Mother.

1126
02:10:35,709 --> 02:10:37,109
My Osman.

1127
02:10:37,749 --> 02:10:40,029
My brave boy who brought good news along.

1128
02:10:43,669 --> 02:10:45,749
I'd die for you.

1129
02:12:15,229 --> 02:12:17,029
Why is my child crying, Artuk Bey?

1130
02:12:24,149 --> 02:12:25,509
I'll go and check.

1131
02:12:38,309 --> 02:12:39,429
My Halime!

1132
02:12:42,109 --> 02:12:43,229
My Halime!

1133
02:12:43,429 --> 02:12:44,629
Halime, talk to me!

1134
02:12:44,709 --> 02:12:45,989
Artuk Bey!

1135
02:12:46,509 --> 02:12:47,589
My Halime!

1136
02:12:53,509 --> 02:12:55,749
Your eyes are open, talk to me, my Halime.

1137
02:12:55,909 --> 02:12:57,109
My Halime!

1138
02:12:59,509 --> 02:13:00,789
Artuk Bey!

1139
02:13:00,909 --> 02:13:02,909
Her eyes are open,
but she won't talk, Artuk Bey.

1140
02:13:34,109 --> 02:13:36,509
My God, help us.

1141
02:13:37,389 --> 02:13:39,469
My God, help us.

1142
02:13:43,789 --> 02:13:45,229
What's going on?

1143
02:13:49,109 --> 02:13:50,229
Son!

1144
02:13:53,309 --> 02:13:54,349
My daughter!

1145
02:14:07,669 --> 02:14:08,749
Artuk Bey!

1146
02:14:13,549 --> 02:14:15,189
I'm sorry for your loss, my Bey.

1147
02:14:22,189 --> 02:14:23,509
My daughter!

1148
02:14:24,589 --> 02:14:26,789
My daughter!

1149
02:14:50,029 --> 02:14:51,909
My daughter!

1150
02:14:52,229 --> 02:14:53,589
Oh, my daughter!

1151
02:14:55,909 --> 02:14:58,189
Oh, my daughter!

1152
02:14:59,709 --> 02:15:01,269
My God!

1153
02:15:18,829 --> 02:15:19,989
Father!

1154
02:15:21,589 --> 02:15:22,629
Father!

1155
02:15:22,869 --> 02:15:24,629
What happened to my mother?

1156
02:15:24,949 --> 02:15:26,069
Father!

1157
02:15:26,149 --> 02:15:27,229
Father!

1158
02:15:27,309 --> 02:15:29,389
-Please.
-Grandma!

1159
02:15:29,949 --> 02:15:31,109
Mother!

1160
02:15:31,349 --> 02:15:32,549
Mother!

1161
02:15:36,509 --> 02:15:37,789
Mother!

1162
02:15:38,389 --> 02:15:39,789
Son, stop!

1163
02:15:50,749 --> 02:15:51,869
Mother!

1164
02:16:01,149 --> 02:16:03,709
Nothing happened to my mother.
Get up, Mother!

1165
02:16:11,389 --> 02:16:13,309
Her eyes are open!

1166
02:16:13,989 --> 02:16:15,869
Her gazelle eyes are open!

1167
02:16:21,989 --> 02:16:24,349
Oh my girl...

1168
02:16:25,029 --> 02:16:27,309
My daughter!

1169
02:16:27,949 --> 02:16:29,229
Don't close them, mother!

1170
02:16:30,789 --> 02:16:32,109
Don't close them!

1171
02:16:38,869 --> 02:16:39,949
Mother!

1172
02:16:45,549 --> 02:16:46,949
Mother!

1173
02:16:48,669 --> 02:16:49,909
Mother!

1174
02:16:51,949 --> 02:16:53,269
Mother!

1175
02:16:53,829 --> 02:16:54,989
Son!

1176
02:16:55,149 --> 02:16:56,469
Mother!

1177
02:17:09,509 --> 02:17:10,789
Mother!

1178
02:17:44,309 --> 02:17:45,909
-My boy!
-Mother!

1179
02:17:46,029 --> 02:17:47,749
Mother!
