00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 94 will start after 12:30 min.

13:06.582 --> 13:07.502
Who the hell are they?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.000
Don't let Ertuğrul get away.

13:33.440 --> 13:37.080
Damn it. These are Ares' men.

13:37.240 --> 13:39.400
So you found me, bastards.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.280
-Come on, then.
-Attack!

14:38.600 --> 14:42.040
-Ertuğrul is escaping.
-Don't let him get away.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.680
Fall back!

14:57.760 --> 15:00.360
Let them go. We'll deal with them later.

15:00.480 --> 15:03.160
Hurry up. Let's go after Ertuğrul.

15:10.800 --> 15:14.640
The bey was elected as per our traditions.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.760
What is the purpose of asking
for another election?

15:19.800 --> 15:24.080
Our traditions will be lost once injustice
emerges, Lady Hayme.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.880
Dündar Bey made a decision
with his authority.

15:28.640 --> 15:34.000
But decisions against the cause
are not legitimate.

15:34.680 --> 15:40.320
It's my right to ask for an election
given the circumstances.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.680
-Artuk Bey is right.
-We won't give up on the cause.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.920
Nonsense. Ertuğrul Bey became a martyr.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.800
We need to think about the future
of our tribe and children.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.880
If...

15:52.000 --> 15:54.680
the elections aren't held,

15:54.920 --> 15:56.560
I'll consider it a violation of tradition.

15:57.160 --> 16:03.400
With the beys and alps who support me,
I won't obey Dündar Bey's decisions.

16:03.480 --> 16:06.800
How come? Is that even possible?

16:06.960 --> 16:10.760
This situation causes unrest
within the tribe. It needs to be resolved.

16:11.920 --> 16:16.560
It seems you don't think
about the peace of the tribe, Artuk Bey.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.600
But I do.

16:19.320 --> 16:23.120
I'll gather the council
at an appropriate time,

16:23.560 --> 16:28.440
just like my ancestors allowed it
to be gathered...

16:29.240 --> 16:31.760
in even the most extreme conditions.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.320
Make the preparations.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.280
Let's hope for good...

16:39.480 --> 16:41.880
and have a good result.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.720
May God...

16:45.760 --> 16:51.560
protect our unity and peace.

16:51.800 --> 16:55.800
Amen.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.560
I hope it will be good for you
and our tribe, Artuk Bey.

17:21.320 --> 17:24.640
How many traders reside in the bazaar?

17:25.880 --> 17:30.600
We don't have an exact number.
But thanks to the laws of Ertuğrul Bey,

17:30.680 --> 17:35.280
and the location of the bazaar,
it attracts traders and customers.

17:35.360 --> 17:38.240
-But--
-How is the income?

17:38.320 --> 17:42.160
It's good, Your Eminence. It's a fortune
for a man who knows to manage it.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.720
Very well.

17:44.520 --> 17:49.720
Then we need to do whatever it takes
to improve the business in the bazaar.

17:51.640 --> 17:55.400
You'll be my eyes and ears
in the bazaar, Aleko.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.960
I'll wait for the information
you'll provide.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.480
You understand, right?

18:04.200 --> 18:07.760
As you command, Your Eminence. Excuse me.

18:36.360 --> 18:41.240
I'm having a hard time deciding which
of your gifts to wear for the dinner.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.040
Could you please help me pick one?

19:00.040 --> 19:02.800
Why did Simko give you to me, Maria?

19:03.840 --> 19:04.800
Speak.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.680
Or else I'll kill you right here
and throw your body from the walls.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.800
I don't understand what you are saying.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.680
I was his slave.

19:25.840 --> 19:31.080
You took me from him
and gave me a new life.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.720
-I'm just a poor girl.
-Hush.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.200
What do you know about Ertuğrul?

19:37.960 --> 19:40.440
Speak. Tell me.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.120
I don't know anyone called Ertuğrul.

19:44.760 --> 19:50.520
Why did Simko give you to me?
Why did he put you in this castle, huh?

19:50.640 --> 19:54.280
What do you know about Ertuğrul, Maria?
Where is Simko?

19:58.040 --> 20:01.280
I swear I don't know any Ertuğrul.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.240
Simko has a man.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.200
His name is Antheus.

20:12.840 --> 20:18.920
I heard him saying that they found
a Turk who was about to die,

20:19.320 --> 20:26.120
and they were to make lots of money.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.920
I'm begging you.
I don't know anything else.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.640
I don't believe a single word
you say, Maria.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.280
I don't believe you. Where is Simko?

20:38.640 --> 20:42.080
I swear to God, I don't know.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.080
Soldier!

21:08.600 --> 21:11.400
-Get a doctor. Right now!
-Yes, sir.

21:48.633 --> 21:52.273
Mother, you are so valuable to us.

21:53.393 --> 21:55.233
Your word is more important than anything.

21:55.993 --> 21:58.473
I'd like to know what you think
about the matter of migration.

22:02.513 --> 22:03.953
Come sit by me.

22:09.233 --> 22:12.473
The arguments at the party
made me uneasy, Son.

22:14.953 --> 22:18.033
The course of events doesn’t bode well.

22:19.273 --> 22:25.073
If the fire of conflict starts to burn in
our tribe, God forbid, we will perish.

22:25.873 --> 22:29.033
That is why I want the marketplace
to be sold and for us to migrate, Mother.

22:30.993 --> 22:32.473
I want to be one with my brothers.

22:34.313 --> 22:36.113
Otherwise, we will lose
each other at this frontier.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.273
You are right, my son.

22:41.433 --> 22:43.273
Strength comes from unity.

22:45.313 --> 22:48.793
I too find it appropriate
for the Kayi to stand as one.

23:03.473 --> 23:05.433
Then why are you
so deep in thought, Mother?

23:06.433 --> 23:07.713
What's making you uncomfortable?

23:11.313 --> 23:12.313
Look, Son.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.633
We came here
to strike fear in the ruthless

23:17.153 --> 23:19.753
and bring hope to the oppressed.

23:21.553 --> 23:24.913
We, and Ertuğrul, fought hard for this.

23:26.833 --> 23:30.953
I say, let us send a messenger
to your brothers

23:32.033 --> 23:33.553
and call them back here.

23:34.553 --> 23:38.713
And if they don't come,
let us ride to them.

23:39.473 --> 23:42.473
What do you say?

23:47.673 --> 23:50.753
My hope in migrating is
that it will unify the tribes, Mother.

23:51.873 --> 23:53.873
I don't think my brothers would come.

23:54.953 --> 23:56.753
They have grown roots there, Mother.

23:59.873 --> 24:00.913
Yes, but...

24:04.393 --> 24:07.753
how could I leave my Ertuğrul's
grave here and go?

24:16.953 --> 24:17.953
Don't you worry, Mother.

24:19.273 --> 24:21.833
I will send the messenger.
I will do as you say.

24:26.993 --> 24:30.273
That would do, my son. That would do.

24:32.873 --> 24:33.873
Excuse me, Mother.

25:54.113 --> 25:54.953
Ertuğrul Bey.

25:56.993 --> 25:59.393
You'll find out who set you up
sooner or later.

25:59.913 --> 26:03.073
When the time comes,
they will all feel my wrath.

26:03.393 --> 26:04.473
This way.

26:26.713 --> 26:29.553
She has a concussion, my lord.
She is not well.

26:29.913 --> 26:31.513
I don't care what she has.

26:32.233 --> 26:34.193
Make sure she lives
long enough to talk,

26:34.313 --> 26:37.673
-or I'll have you thrown off the wall.
-I will get her to come around, My Lord.

26:38.193 --> 26:39.113
Help me.

26:40.953 --> 26:41.993
Let's take her to the bed.

26:44.073 --> 26:45.673
Careful! Keep her steady!

27:11.073 --> 27:12.833
-My lord.
-Speak.

27:12.913 --> 27:15.713
I sent our best warriors to aid Mihalis.

27:18.593 --> 27:22.913
Ertuğrul will understand that he is
being pursued once Mihalis attacks.

27:24.153 --> 27:26.513
Ertuğrul doesn't know
that I was the one who set him up.

27:26.953 --> 27:28.153
What if he finds out?

27:28.953 --> 27:31.393
Ertuğrul will die before he makes it to
his tribe, Lukas,

27:31.513 --> 27:33.713
or he will die with them.

27:34.353 --> 27:38.313
We are assuming a state of war. I have
had it with this fake peace agreement.

27:38.793 --> 27:42.073
We cannot rid these lands of the Turks
without shedding blood by the gallon.

27:42.513 --> 27:45.673
-Gather the commanders.
-Yes, my lord.

27:45.913 --> 27:48.273
They are in your chambers awaiting you.

27:50.873 --> 27:51.753
Door.

28:06.833 --> 28:08.393
They're coming. Settle down.

28:09.913 --> 28:12.873
He's alive! Ertuğrul Bey is alive!

28:13.113 --> 28:16.113
-Thank God.
-We are grateful.

28:16.273 --> 28:18.273
-You're alive.
-Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

28:18.353 --> 28:21.073
Ertuğrul Bey, you're alive!

28:21.153 --> 28:23.153
Thank God you're all right, Ertuğrul Bey.

28:23.713 --> 28:26.193
We are grateful, Ertuğrul Bey.
You saved our lives.

28:26.273 --> 28:27.473
You're welcome.

28:28.553 --> 28:30.193
-Thank you.
-Thank God.

28:30.513 --> 28:32.273
It is now time for us to part ways.

28:32.433 --> 28:35.673
Go to your families, your loved ones.

28:37.553 --> 28:39.073
-No. No.
-No.

28:39.753 --> 28:43.953
We won't leave you by yourself
after all you've done for us.

28:44.033 --> 28:46.513
Pito is right.
We won't leave you, Ertuğrul Bey.

28:47.993 --> 28:51.553
You are good people.
However, their quarrel is with me.

28:52.193 --> 28:55.473
My road is rugged. You won't make it.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.913
-Go to your loved ones.
-No...

28:59.273 --> 29:00.913
This is my fight.

29:03.753 --> 29:08.593
Show us how to fight, Ertuğrul Bey,
so that when we find our families,

29:08.713 --> 29:10.753
we can protect them.

29:10.873 --> 29:13.833
This is our fight too, now, Ertuğrul Bey.
If it weren't for you,

29:13.913 --> 29:17.313
-we'd be galley slaves our whole lives.
-You saved our lives.

29:17.393 --> 29:19.313
-We won't leave you.
-Yeah.

29:20.433 --> 29:24.193
They have horses.
They will find us in no time.

29:24.593 --> 29:25.993
We can't escape.

29:27.513 --> 29:29.473
If you want to stay by my side...

29:29.833 --> 29:31.113
-Yes.
-We do.

29:31.193 --> 29:32.793
...then we will ambush them.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.033
Ambush? How?

29:36.233 --> 29:37.913
How can we do that?

29:38.273 --> 29:40.953
We will lure them in.

29:42.753 --> 29:44.513
None of us even have a sword.

29:46.393 --> 29:49.953
Sometimes a rock is better than a sword.

29:53.193 --> 29:58.713
Know that every rock you throw will
sever a link from the chain of captivity.

29:59.553 --> 30:03.033
It will bring us
one step closer to liberty.

30:03.113 --> 30:05.473
-Yes, that's right.
-It's true. Yes.

30:05.553 --> 30:08.273
-We won't be held captive.
-Yeah!

30:08.353 --> 30:10.673
-We won't be belittled!
-Yeah!

30:10.833 --> 30:13.153
-We won't surrender.
-Yeah!

30:13.233 --> 30:16.513
We will show courage against cruelty,

30:16.673 --> 30:19.113
-and fight for liberty against captivity.
-Yeah!

30:19.193 --> 30:21.193
-We'll do it, yeah!
-We will.

30:50.353 --> 30:55.153
"The sultan's crown
depends upon the vizier's pen.

30:56.193 --> 31:00.313
If the ink runs dry,
his rule will come to an end."

31:02.393 --> 31:06.073
What a nice saying by the Seljuks'
grand emir, Nizâmülmülk.

31:09.073 --> 31:09.993
Alas...

31:11.953 --> 31:13.273
his end was grim.

31:18.993 --> 31:20.353
Speak, Göktuğ.

31:20.833 --> 31:24.433
Dündar Bey is on his way, Your Eminence.
He is coming before you.

31:26.073 --> 31:30.033
He must have managed to persuade his tribe
if he is coming so quickly. Good.

31:32.393 --> 31:36.073
Send word to Bahadir Bey immediately.
Call him also.

31:36.353 --> 31:39.313
They'll be introduced to Dündar Bey
and will talk of the agreement.

31:39.553 --> 31:43.033
-So soon, Eminence?
-We have no time to lose.

31:43.473 --> 31:47.073
The caravans from Konya
and Kayseri are already on their way.

31:47.553 --> 31:50.873
The bazaar must be sold fast
and order must be established.

31:51.593 --> 31:54.073
It should be formed
so that the bazaar may grow.

31:55.753 --> 31:57.193
Yes, my emir.

32:20.313 --> 32:22.153
They can't have gotten far.

32:25.313 --> 32:28.873
The tracks lead in this direction.
He is not alone. Someone else is with him.

32:28.953 --> 32:32.273
They must have headed towards
the escaped slaves. Be cautious.

32:32.993 --> 32:36.393
Don't forget that we are after one of
the fiercest Turkish warriors. Move out.

33:03.633 --> 33:05.433
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

33:12.793 --> 33:15.673
Are the horses ready
to ride to Aslıhan's tribe, Halime?

33:17.273 --> 33:19.313
Word will be sent when they are.

33:29.633 --> 33:30.673
Neslihan.

33:41.033 --> 33:43.073
Speak your mind, my daughter.

34:02.793 --> 34:08.033
You are the wife of Süleyman Shah,
the pillar of the Kayi Tribe, Mother.

34:09.033 --> 34:15.273
The storms you have weathered,
the typhoons you have withstood...

34:15.433 --> 34:19.593
You've held our tribe,
our marquee together.

34:21.153 --> 34:24.833
So, how can you not stand against
Dündar Bey's decision?

34:31.753 --> 34:32.833
Look, my daughter.

34:34.073 --> 34:39.713
Dündar Bey is the pillar of our marquee,
the bey of our tribe.

34:40.673 --> 34:44.553
He has made a decision
so that we don't fall apart.

34:45.113 --> 34:49.393
Mother, we came to these lands
to make them our own,

34:49.993 --> 34:51.833
not to abandon them.

34:52.273 --> 34:56.953
We spilled blood,
gave our lives for these lands.

34:57.633 --> 34:59.153
We worked for it.

35:00.113 --> 35:01.513
We have hope for it.

35:02.553 --> 35:05.553
Ertuğrul lies
in the tribe's burial ground, Mother.

35:07.193 --> 35:09.633
We can't leave.

35:12.673 --> 35:17.673
What do you think my goal is?
I'm only thinking of you.

35:19.313 --> 35:22.993
My girl, don't you see
that we are heading for the worst?

35:23.833 --> 35:29.953
Besides, Dündar isn't like
Süleyman Shah or Ertuğrul.

35:30.433 --> 35:35.473
They are experienced
and have been through a lot.

35:36.153 --> 35:37.913
Dündar is young.

35:39.553 --> 35:44.073
He is not fit to endure
such circumstances, don't you see?

35:44.873 --> 35:47.953
We've got you, Mother. We have us.

35:48.273 --> 35:51.393
We will carry the burden of the world
if need be.

35:52.873 --> 35:54.713
-Right?
-Oh, my girl!

35:57.953 --> 35:59.353
You don't get it, do you?

36:01.153 --> 36:06.753
With Ertuğrul gone, this is no longer
our home, but a foreign land.

36:07.873 --> 36:08.753
Mother!

36:12.673 --> 36:13.553
And...

36:14.993 --> 36:16.513
And don't be hasty.

36:17.593 --> 36:22.233
I've spoken to Dündar.
He will send word to his brothers.

36:22.833 --> 36:26.713
He will call them here
so that we may be together.

36:27.993 --> 36:30.313
How can you trust
in that outcome, Mother?

36:30.993 --> 36:34.073
Neither Sungurtekin Bey nor Gündoğdu Bey

36:34.713 --> 36:39.433
will leave the lands they made their home
for so many years, and come here.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.873
We need to get to Aslıhan
as soon as possible.

36:48.713 --> 36:50.233
She needs us.

38:34.713 --> 38:39.633
These ashes will stop the blood
flowing from your wound, Ertuğrul Bey.

39:12.833 --> 39:14.433
Thank you, Pito.

39:25.073 --> 39:27.353
-Fasten the rags securely.
-Okay.

39:32.353 --> 39:34.193
Sharpen the ends of the branches.

39:35.833 --> 39:38.833
The resulting pikes
will pierce the enemy's chest.

39:52.833 --> 39:54.193
Why are you crying?

39:56.553 --> 40:00.593
When I was captured by Simko, I gave up.
I gave in to slavery.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.793
Thanks to you, I've summoned the courage
to return to my kids.

40:04.033 --> 40:08.353
God bless you, Ertuğrul Bey.
May He return you to your loved ones.

40:21.153 --> 40:25.273
We will fight
without giving up hope in God.

40:26.113 --> 40:30.393
Know that He is by our side.

40:30.753 --> 40:34.193
-God bless you.
-God bless you, Ertuğrul Bey.

41:20.033 --> 41:21.313
Permission to enter, my bey.

41:22.233 --> 41:23.113
Enter.

41:44.553 --> 41:45.833
What is this chest, my bey?

41:52.513 --> 41:56.753
The real spoils of the war, my lady.

41:57.633 --> 42:00.913
This will secure our legacy

42:01.513 --> 42:02.793
Permission to enter, my bey.

42:04.273 --> 42:05.233
Yes, enter.

42:11.873 --> 42:15.193
Emir Sadettin has sent word.
He's asking to see you.

42:17.633 --> 42:18.833
What could he want?

42:20.913 --> 42:23.993
-Okay. Get ready.
-Yes, my bey.

42:34.873 --> 42:38.273
They said that Emir Sadettin
knew how to fill a chest.

42:38.873 --> 42:40.433
They were right, my bey.

42:41.553 --> 42:45.833
It's clear he has given you this to help
in your role as bey of the frontier.

42:47.233 --> 42:50.673
Emir Sadettin is just
our guarantee, Karaca.

42:52.353 --> 42:56.633
We are more powerful than both Aslıhan
and the Kayis.

42:57.313 --> 42:58.873
From now on...

43:00.033 --> 43:03.833
we will crush whoever crosses our path.

43:04.633 --> 43:07.713
Your way is our way,
your strength is our strength, my bey.

43:08.753 --> 43:14.313
Just as I stood by you in bloody wars,
hard days and difficult resettlements...

43:15.153 --> 43:17.113
I am with you in this to the end.

43:19.193 --> 43:23.113
After I return from the emir,
I will sit down and talk with the beys

43:23.353 --> 43:24.993
and convince them to attend a gathering.

43:27.513 --> 43:30.793
You talk with the women of the tribe.

43:31.393 --> 43:33.153
Get them on our side.

43:35.953 --> 43:37.673
Don't worry about me, my bey.

43:38.833 --> 43:41.193
No woman will stand by Aslıhan.

43:46.233 --> 43:50.313
My good fortune,
my marquee's throne, my Karaca.

43:51.913 --> 43:57.953
It is high time we became
the bey and hatun of all the Cavdars.

44:01.193 --> 44:03.313
Come now. Godspeed.

44:04.593 --> 44:05.833
Godspeed, my bey.

44:45.713 --> 44:46.993
We will find Ertuğrul.

44:48.113 --> 44:50.073
He is our only salvation.

44:52.233 --> 44:55.713
Ares picked up on our tracks, Simko.
He's found out who you are.

44:57.513 --> 45:01.073
Either we get our gold
and get the hell out of this place,

45:01.273 --> 45:03.593
or they take us down one by one!

45:05.153 --> 45:06.073
Look here!

45:07.913 --> 45:10.313
We find Ertuğrul
and twe get our gold,

45:10.913 --> 45:13.313
because Simko never backs down,

45:13.833 --> 45:17.033
never gives up and never fails!

45:17.993 --> 45:21.353
We will be swimming in gold, the likes
of which we've never seen before.

45:21.793 --> 45:23.593
The finest food in the world,

45:23.793 --> 45:27.633
the finest wine and the finest women
will be ours.

45:28.713 --> 45:31.793
Understand? Understand?!

45:32.073 --> 45:36.193
Hurray for gold! Hurray for Simko!

45:37.113 --> 45:38.233
Come here.

45:40.593 --> 45:42.153
Get on your horse and go to Antheus.

45:42.233 --> 45:46.553
Tell him to gather his men
and send them here. Go.

45:48.993 --> 45:50.153
I'll find you, Ertuğrul.

45:51.353 --> 45:53.033
I swear I'll find you.

46:32.233 --> 46:33.353
They went this way.

46:33.993 --> 46:34.913
Let's go.

47:13.873 --> 47:16.393
I left trails everywhere,
just as you asked, Ertuğrul Bey.

47:16.713 --> 47:18.753
Sooner or later,
they will fall into our lap.

47:20.113 --> 47:21.353
Good job.

47:27.033 --> 47:31.073
It's time. Keep your eyes
on the enemy at all times.

47:32.873 --> 47:35.353
Think not of death, but life.

47:36.073 --> 47:40.713
Not of fear,
but of returning to your loved ones.

47:41.433 --> 47:44.273
Now, everyone hide
in the positions I assigned.

47:44.793 --> 47:48.273
Hide yourselves so that when they come,

47:48.353 --> 47:52.033
we might come down on them like thunder
when they least expect.

47:52.273 --> 47:53.153
Come on.

47:53.393 --> 47:54.673
-Come on, hurry.
-Come on.

48:00.713 --> 48:03.033
My bey, may God watch over us all.

48:04.113 --> 48:04.993
Thank you.

48:12.553 --> 48:14.153
Come now, you bastards.

48:15.433 --> 48:16.913
The last light you'll see...

48:17.913 --> 48:19.793
will be the one that shines on my sword.

48:59.473 --> 49:02.033
Have you persuaded your tribe, Dündar?

49:02.713 --> 49:06.473
Artuk Bey is opposed to the bazaar
and matters of immigration.

49:06.913 --> 49:09.113
He accuses me of betraying
my brother's cause.

49:09.713 --> 49:10.713
How dare he!

49:12.433 --> 49:13.593
What does he want?

49:15.553 --> 49:19.353
He has asked for a gathering of beys.
He wishes to be bey himself.

49:20.993 --> 49:25.353
Well, well, well!
Isn't that Artuk Bey insolent!

49:26.193 --> 49:29.273
After the death of Ertuğrul Bey,
he finds in himself the desire

49:30.033 --> 49:32.193
to be a bey after all.

49:32.553 --> 49:35.913
All the while, the son
of Süleyman Shah resides among us.

49:37.393 --> 49:40.233
Don't you worry. I am behind you.

49:41.793 --> 49:43.073
Thank you, Your Eminence.

49:45.513 --> 49:46.873
I have no doubt.

49:49.513 --> 49:50.953
So why do you hesitate?

49:52.473 --> 49:54.833
My mother can't bring herself
to leave these lands.

49:55.273 --> 49:57.113
She wants my brothers to come.

49:59.193 --> 50:05.353
Dündar, do you think your brothers
would abandon the lands

50:05.633 --> 50:10.513
they earned with their valor
and loyalty to the sultan?

50:11.153 --> 50:12.473
Don't worry.

50:13.513 --> 50:18.313
When she reunites with her sons,
Hayme Hatun's troubles will cease.

50:32.353 --> 50:34.633
Your Eminence, Bahadir Bey is here.

50:35.473 --> 50:36.473
Let him come.

50:46.993 --> 50:50.073
Bahadir Bey,
brother of the deceased Candar Bey.

50:50.713 --> 50:54.513
Dündar Bey,
son of the deceased Süleyman Shah.

50:59.553 --> 51:01.713
I had the honor of meeting your father.

51:02.033 --> 51:06.913
I am now honored to meet his valiant son.

51:07.713 --> 51:08.913
Thank you, Bahadir Bey.

51:09.753 --> 51:13.673
Everyone knows of your valor
in the war.

51:15.313 --> 51:16.633
Come, sit.

51:53.793 --> 51:57.113
-The tracks are fresh. They walk this way.
-They must be right ahead.

51:58.113 --> 52:00.713
Let's see if you are everything
they say you are.

52:13.073 --> 52:14.353
They're coming, Ertuğrul Bey.

52:15.033 --> 52:16.073
Let them, Pito.

52:17.473 --> 52:20.713
We will not let the deaths of innocents
be in vain.

52:21.433 --> 52:22.713
We will make them spit blood.

52:24.513 --> 52:25.513
Go now.

52:31.993 --> 52:35.673
The Kayi have duly run the Hanlı Bazaar.

52:36.633 --> 52:40.473
Dündar Bey also managed it
as much as he could.

52:40.793 --> 52:42.353
However, this is business.

52:42.993 --> 52:47.913
When things weren't going well,
he expressed the desire to sell it.

52:49.913 --> 52:51.633
We know of the honesty of the Kayi.

52:52.513 --> 52:56.553
The decision that Dündar Bey made
must be with good intent.

52:57.473 --> 52:58.593
Thank you, Bahadir Bey.

52:59.353 --> 53:01.713
We thought that this
was for the best of our tribe.

53:03.313 --> 53:06.113
I would vouch for both of you equally.

53:06.753 --> 53:08.993
One of you is resolved
to make this their land,

53:09.713 --> 53:12.873
and the other to sell and move on.

53:13.793 --> 53:18.233
It falls upon you both to come
to an agreement and help each other out.

53:19.913 --> 53:23.473
There's no need to get strangers
involved in this matter, Dündar Bey.

53:23.993 --> 53:26.393
It is best to agree among ourselves.

53:27.313 --> 53:33.313
And with this deal, we will fortify
the friendship of the Kayis and Cavdars.

53:34.233 --> 53:37.673
First, the gathering of beys must be held,
and I must be chosen as bey.

53:37.993 --> 53:39.513
If it's for the best, it must be so.

53:40.753 --> 53:45.913
Still, present your hand
so that we may see your loyalty as a bey.

53:52.113 --> 53:55.713
With God's permission,
after you become bey,

53:56.113 --> 53:59.073
I wish to buy the Hanlı Bazaar,
Dündar Bey.

54:00.033 --> 54:02.513
Know that I will pay what it is worth.

54:09.913 --> 54:13.753
With God's permission, as soon as
I become bey, the bazaar is yours.

54:16.033 --> 54:20.433
May it be for the best, my beys.
May God allow you to honor your word.

54:23.313 --> 54:27.473
-With your permission, Your Eminence.
-The permission is yours, Dündar Bey.

54:28.353 --> 54:31.433
A lot of people are out to get you.
You should be with your tribe.

54:45.433 --> 54:48.713
I will come and visit you tomorrow.
Make preparations.

54:48.873 --> 54:52.353
It would be an honor to welcome you
into my tent, Your Eminence.

54:52.553 --> 54:53.473
Tent?

54:54.513 --> 54:55.873
What's the marquee for, then?

54:58.313 --> 55:02.993
Aslıhan Hatun won't welcome us
into her tribe, Your Eminence,

55:03.193 --> 55:06.273
so she continues to keep us in a tent.

55:08.033 --> 55:13.473
By my orders, that is your land.
Who does this Aslıhan think she is?

55:17.073 --> 55:21.193
You will prepare a worthy feast tomorrow
at the marquee for us.

55:21.473 --> 55:22.673
I will come too.

55:23.233 --> 55:27.233
Let this Aslıhan see
who is the one with the power.

55:30.513 --> 55:33.433
May I take my leave then, Your Eminence?

55:33.753 --> 55:34.833
You may.

55:44.273 --> 55:45.193
Göktuğ.

55:47.593 --> 55:51.113
Tell Ares that Bahadir
and Dündar have agreed.

55:54.473 --> 55:56.033
Yes, Your Eminence.

57:25.753 --> 57:27.393
It's a trap. Kill them!

58:10.313 --> 58:14.113
Why don't we go after them too, my lord?
Ertuğrul is alone.

58:14.273 --> 58:17.913
-It would be easy to finish him off.
-We don't know exactly where they are.

58:19.393 --> 58:22.193
And we can't draw more attention
and get in more trouble.

58:23.153 --> 58:24.513
Ertuğrul is heavily wounded.

58:25.153 --> 58:28.873
He can't take on both Mihalis
and the reinforcements I sent after him.

58:29.473 --> 58:34.353
More importantly, Marya will tell me
where Simko sent Ertuğrul.

58:34.473 --> 58:36.873
Mihalis and his men are great warriors.

58:36.953 --> 58:39.713
To this day, they have killed many people
and raided many caravans

58:39.793 --> 58:41.033
without suffering any losses.

58:41.193 --> 58:45.273
-Mihalis will return with Ertuğrul's head.
-What if Ertuğrul manages to survive?

58:45.353 --> 58:48.513
He will come at us
like an arrow let loose.

58:48.673 --> 58:50.273
That's why I gathered you here.

58:51.033 --> 58:54.713
If Ertuğrul finds out that I set him up
and returns to his tribe,

58:54.793 --> 58:56.553
then war will be inevitable.

58:57.073 --> 59:00.153
We cannot leave it to chance.
Let the preparations begin.

59:00.873 --> 59:04.313
-As of now, we are in a state of war.
-Yes, my lord!

59:04.633 --> 59:07.033
Hasten the reinforcement of the walls.

59:07.393 --> 59:09.393
Recruit men from the villages
by force if necessary.

59:09.873 --> 59:11.913
I want all preparations completed
within three days.

59:12.153 --> 59:15.513
-Every soldier in the fort must be ready.
-Yes, my lord!

59:17.913 --> 59:21.753
Don't forget, our first aim is to kill
Ertuğrul before he reaches his tribe.

59:22.193 --> 59:25.873
If we don't succeed,
a bloody war with the Turks awaits us.

01:00:17.233 --> 01:00:19.993
What did you do, Ertuğrul Bey?
You needed that man alive.

01:00:22.673 --> 01:00:25.593
Burn in hell, Turk!
You will die before you learn anything!

01:00:36.713 --> 01:00:42.433
Welcome. Welcome, Hayme Hatun!

01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:44.433
Welcome.

01:00:45.953 --> 01:00:48.593
Mother Hayme, welcome!
Welcome, Hayme Hatun!

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:53.033
Welcome. Welcome, Hayme Hatun!

01:00:53.953 --> 01:00:55.873
-Welcome.
-Take the reins.

01:00:56.633 --> 01:00:58.633
Welcome.

01:01:02.193 --> 01:01:04.873
-Welcome, Halime Hatun.
-Welcome.

01:01:12.793 --> 01:01:14.153
Welcome to my tribe.

01:01:16.913 --> 01:01:17.793
Mother.

01:01:19.793 --> 01:01:21.273
I'm happy to be here, my girl.

01:01:21.953 --> 01:01:22.913
Halime.

01:01:31.233 --> 01:01:33.593
We heard of your situation
and came at once.

01:01:34.393 --> 01:01:39.193
I am very thankful.
I know you won't leave me alone.

01:01:40.353 --> 01:01:41.313
Come.

01:01:52.113 --> 01:01:55.233
Those are Ertuğrul Bey's wife and mother.

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:58.793
It shows.

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:04.873
Aslıhan Hatun has already begun
the fight against Bahadir Bey.

01:02:05.753 --> 01:02:08.513
This fight will cost many lives,
Karaca Hatun.

01:02:09.513 --> 01:02:12.033
May God protect us
from the evil of raging women.

01:02:18.164 --> 01:02:19.244
Thank you, dear.

01:02:21.524 --> 01:02:22.524
Thank you.

01:02:38.844 --> 01:02:39.964
Ever since he arrived,

01:02:40.444 --> 01:02:42.404
he made his intentions clear.

01:02:44.124 --> 01:02:46.804
He dared to threaten me in my own tent.

01:02:48.444 --> 01:02:50.164
What does he want from you?

01:02:52.244 --> 01:02:54.164
A council, as soon as possible.

01:02:54.724 --> 01:02:56.364
He wants to become bey.

01:02:57.764 --> 01:02:59.564
What will you do, Aslıhan Hatun?

01:03:01.484 --> 01:03:03.004
I won't give up my cause.

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:06.764
I'll look after my brother's legacy.

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:11.004
And we wish to protect
Ertuğrul Bey's legacy.

01:03:13.724 --> 01:03:15.724
But Dündar Bey thinks otherwise.

01:03:18.524 --> 01:03:19.524
Hope for the best.

01:03:20.524 --> 01:03:22.564
Dündar Bey wants to sell
the Hanli Bazaar

01:03:22.884 --> 01:03:26.124
and go live with his brothers Gündoğdu and
Sungur Tekin.

01:03:26.764 --> 01:03:28.524
What do you think, Halime Hatun?

01:03:29.484 --> 01:03:30.484
Mother,

01:03:30.804 --> 01:03:32.044
when I have difficulties,

01:03:32.644 --> 01:03:34.644
wherever the issue comes from,

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.084
the Kayis used to have my back.

01:03:39.204 --> 01:03:40.724
If you go as well,

01:03:42.244 --> 01:03:43.724
what will I do then?

01:03:44.564 --> 01:03:45.964
Calm down, dear.

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:48.204
Nothing is certain yet.

01:03:49.364 --> 01:03:50.564
Let the council start,

01:03:51.284 --> 01:03:52.564
let's see what happens.

01:03:53.564 --> 01:03:54.884
Turgut will soon come.

01:03:55.604 --> 01:03:58.924
We will never leave you alone, neither he
nor us.

01:04:02.124 --> 01:04:04.604
Aslıhan Hatun, the molasses is boiled.

01:04:05.084 --> 01:04:07.444
The women want you to taste it first.

01:04:11.644 --> 01:04:13.124
Let's hope for the best.

01:04:14.324 --> 01:04:17.884
Now, let's go see the women.

01:04:18.524 --> 01:04:19.804
Let's go.

01:05:10.124 --> 01:05:13.084
I serve Mihalis. I swear,
I don't know anything.

01:05:13.524 --> 01:05:16.444
I'll kill you if you don't tell me
who Mihalis's master is.

01:05:16.764 --> 01:05:17.644
Who is it?

01:05:24.724 --> 01:05:26.524
Stop, enough.

01:05:26.764 --> 01:05:28.364
I'll talk.

01:06:08.724 --> 01:06:09.764
Simko!

01:06:46.724 --> 01:06:48.724
Enjoy it, Mother Hayme.

01:07:21.564 --> 01:07:23.364
-Well done.
-Enjoy it.

01:07:24.604 --> 01:07:25.604
Women!

01:07:27.364 --> 01:07:30.284
Well done, it's delicious.

01:07:30.804 --> 01:07:32.524
Thank you, Hayme Hatun.

01:07:34.644 --> 01:07:35.644
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:07:37.684 --> 01:07:38.684
Karaca Hatun.

01:07:39.884 --> 01:07:41.444
Bahadır Bey's wife.

01:07:45.204 --> 01:07:46.804
Welcome, Karaca Hatun.

01:07:47.484 --> 01:07:50.924
We've seen your legendary friendship
with Aslıhan Hatun firsthand.

01:07:59.284 --> 01:08:00.764
Thanks, Karaca Hatun.

01:08:00.884 --> 01:08:03.844
I hope that when Bahadır Bey is set up
in his tent,

01:08:04.084 --> 01:08:05.404
our friendship continues.

01:08:05.724 --> 01:08:09.804
As long as Aslıhan Hatun stays here,
our friendship will continue.

01:08:11.924 --> 01:08:12.924
I'm disappointed,

01:08:13.724 --> 01:08:16.684
given that when her betrothed,
Turgut Alp, returns,

01:08:17.044 --> 01:08:18.924
Aslıhan Hatun can't stay here.

01:08:19.684 --> 01:08:20.964
She'll go to his village.

01:08:24.964 --> 01:08:26.404
Don't be so sure about...

01:08:26.924 --> 01:08:29.004
who will live where,

01:08:29.484 --> 01:08:30.844
Karaca Hatun.

01:09:02.244 --> 01:09:05.324
What a disloyal man you are, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:09:06.044 --> 01:09:08.964
Since when does the wolf bow
before the coyote, Simko?

01:09:10.404 --> 01:09:13.204
Leave us, Ertuğrul Bey. Save yourself.

01:09:14.644 --> 01:09:15.644
Let him go, scum.

01:09:15.924 --> 01:09:17.204
Their lives...

01:09:17.724 --> 01:09:18.724
are in your hands.

01:09:19.204 --> 01:09:20.444
Surrender,

01:09:20.964 --> 01:09:23.204
or I'll kill them all.

01:09:41.164 --> 01:09:43.244
You won't get away with this, Simko.

01:10:00.204 --> 01:10:02.124
Ertuğrul killed two of our men, Simko.

01:10:03.084 --> 01:10:04.564
Damned Turk.

01:10:06.044 --> 01:10:07.124
What's that?

01:10:07.284 --> 01:10:10.164
We found this pigeon on the horse
of one of Mihalis's men.

01:10:10.564 --> 01:10:13.364
Now we know how Ares got his news so fast.

01:10:13.964 --> 01:10:15.564
Let it fly for us now,

01:10:16.404 --> 01:10:17.404
so that Ares...

01:10:18.164 --> 01:10:20.164
will know that I have Ertuğrul.

01:10:21.044 --> 01:10:22.964
When he does, he'll prepare our gold.

01:10:25.364 --> 01:10:26.364
Get ready.

01:10:26.804 --> 01:10:28.644
We'll spend the night in the cave.

01:10:39.324 --> 01:10:41.324
Will you sell the bazaar and migrate?

01:10:42.244 --> 01:10:44.124
Nothing is certain yet, Karaca Hatun.

01:10:45.524 --> 01:10:46.524
Really?

01:10:46.884 --> 01:10:48.804
Dündar Bey spoke with Bahadır Bey.

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:52.804
He said that after being elected bey,
he wanted to sell the bazaar.

01:10:55.844 --> 01:10:58.284
When did Bahadır Bey speak to Dündar Bey?

01:10:59.004 --> 01:11:01.004
When Emir Sadettin invited him.

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:04.604
They met there and discussed the issue.

01:11:05.964 --> 01:11:09.084
When Dündar Bey said he wanted to
sell the bazaar,

01:11:09.644 --> 01:11:13.284
Bahadır Bey asked to buy it,
so that it would still be ours.

01:11:20.204 --> 01:11:21.524
Excuse us, dear.

01:12:30.164 --> 01:12:32.324
Coyotes waiting for carrion, huh?

01:12:33.404 --> 01:12:35.124
You'll only get...

01:12:35.924 --> 01:12:37.804
my bloodthirsty sword.

01:13:07.164 --> 01:13:08.204
Show your face.

01:13:20.084 --> 01:13:21.164
Show yourself.

01:13:21.804 --> 01:13:22.804
Who are you?

01:13:31.444 --> 01:13:32.444
Who are you?

01:13:46.844 --> 01:13:47.844
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:13:48.764 --> 01:13:49.764
Why didn't you go?

01:13:50.804 --> 01:13:52.404
Why didn't you save yourself?

01:13:56.644 --> 01:13:59.964
We do not leave our comrades behind, Pito.

01:14:00.844 --> 01:14:02.804
Was it worth it for a thief?

01:14:06.164 --> 01:14:07.924
How many times have I told you

01:14:08.084 --> 01:14:10.044
not to approach Ertuğrul?

01:14:10.804 --> 01:14:11.804
Go there.

01:14:12.764 --> 01:14:13.924
Let him go, Simko.

01:14:15.004 --> 01:14:16.764
Do what you want to me.

01:14:21.244 --> 01:14:22.324
Do you know...

01:14:22.684 --> 01:14:24.844
how many slaves I lost because of you?

01:14:25.724 --> 01:14:27.524
You cost me a lot.

01:14:28.084 --> 01:14:29.084
A lot.

01:14:29.204 --> 01:14:30.524
We're almost there.

01:14:31.364 --> 01:14:32.724
We'll sell these slaves

01:14:33.244 --> 01:14:34.924
and then hand you to your owner.

01:14:35.884 --> 01:14:37.964
Then, I'll leave this place.

01:14:39.244 --> 01:14:41.124
That scumbag who ambushed me...

01:14:43.044 --> 01:14:45.044
knows you and your intentions.

01:14:49.884 --> 01:14:51.044
He'll kill you.

01:14:51.604 --> 01:14:54.244
Even if you get your cursed gold,

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:56.524
sooner or later,

01:14:57.164 --> 01:14:58.284
he'll kill you all.

01:15:02.044 --> 01:15:03.044
Now,

01:15:03.804 --> 01:15:05.444
if you let us all go...

01:15:07.484 --> 01:15:09.804
and tell me who plotted against me,

01:15:10.884 --> 01:15:11.884
I'll kill him,

01:15:12.524 --> 01:15:15.244
and save you and your men from him.

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:23.644
Ah, Ertuğrul Bey...

01:15:25.964 --> 01:15:27.924
Even you aren't strong enough...

01:15:28.604 --> 01:15:29.924
for him.

01:15:31.244 --> 01:15:32.244
If you were,

01:15:32.684 --> 01:15:35.124
you wouldn't have walked into that trap.

01:15:52.804 --> 01:15:55.804
Do you see the results
of Dündar Bey's decisions, Mother?

01:15:56.404 --> 01:16:00.364
If Bahadır Bey buys the bazaar, his claim
to be the bey will be stronger.

01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:04.524
Then we'll have turned our backs
on Aslıhan Hatun.

01:16:07.204 --> 01:16:08.684
Aslıhan is my daughter.

01:16:09.844 --> 01:16:11.604
And the bride of my village.

01:16:12.244 --> 01:16:15.564
First, we must solve our own problems.

01:16:16.124 --> 01:16:17.924
-The solution is obvious.
-Mother...

01:16:18.644 --> 01:16:22.924
Bahadır Bey wishes to defeat
Aslıhan Hatun and become bey.

01:16:23.324 --> 01:16:26.604
So, our solution is to sell him
the bazaar?

01:16:26.844 --> 01:16:30.644
Whomever pays the full price
can have the bazaar.

01:16:31.724 --> 01:16:34.484
Even if it's Bahadır Bey,
it's acceptable.

01:16:36.204 --> 01:16:37.324
And Aslıhan Hatun?

01:16:39.124 --> 01:16:40.324
You're not only...

01:16:41.364 --> 01:16:43.964
harming us, but her too.
Don't you see, Dündar Bey?

01:16:44.244 --> 01:16:46.404
Aslıhan Hatun is no stranger
to our village.

01:16:47.364 --> 01:16:48.804
My brother left her to us.

01:16:49.564 --> 01:16:51.084
I will always respect her.

01:16:51.404 --> 01:16:53.644
She can live in my village with her man.

01:16:56.404 --> 01:16:57.684
She'll never come.

01:16:58.924 --> 01:17:02.324
She'll keep her word to Aliyar
and will stay in her village.

01:17:04.564 --> 01:17:05.804
You'll lose Turgut,

01:17:06.284 --> 01:17:07.964
along with her.

01:17:12.364 --> 01:17:15.284
I'm against your decision, Dündar Bey.

01:17:16.884 --> 01:17:19.004
I'll support Artuk Bey from now on.

01:17:20.924 --> 01:17:22.364
Keep that in mind.

01:17:40.684 --> 01:17:41.684
Marya.

01:17:43.404 --> 01:17:44.964
How could you do this, Marya?

01:17:46.124 --> 01:17:47.724
I gave you a new life.

01:17:57.884 --> 01:17:58.884
Speak.

01:17:59.044 --> 01:18:00.924
Emir Sadettin sent news, sir.

01:18:01.484 --> 01:18:03.284
Dündar Bey agreed with Bahadır Bey.

01:18:03.724 --> 01:18:06.164
The inn will be sold tomorrow
after the council.

01:18:08.324 --> 01:18:10.444
We have to do this soon, Lukas.

01:18:12.444 --> 01:18:13.804
We can't risk it.

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:16.004
Any news from Mihalis?

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:17.324
Not yet, sir.

01:18:22.284 --> 01:18:23.564
A pigeon arrived, sir.

01:18:25.804 --> 01:18:26.804
Must be Mihalis.

01:18:29.684 --> 01:18:32.444
<i>Dear Ares, all the men you sent are dead.</i>

01:18:32.924 --> 01:18:34.364
<i>I still have Ertuğrul.</i>

01:18:35.084 --> 01:18:36.564
<i>For 10,000 gold,</i>

01:18:36.644 --> 01:18:39.524
<i>you can prevent a great war</i>
<i>against the Seljuks.</i>

01:18:40.244 --> 01:18:41.844
<i>You'll hear from me soon.</i>

01:18:42.244 --> 01:18:43.964
<i>If you don't pay me,</i>

01:18:44.244 --> 01:18:45.844
<i>Ertuğrul will learn it all.</i>

01:18:46.124 --> 01:18:48.684
<i>I won't be responsible for what happens</i>
<i>afterwards.</i>

01:18:49.164 --> 01:18:50.164
<i>Simko.</i>

01:18:58.924 --> 01:18:59.924
Simko.

01:19:00.884 --> 01:19:04.004
-He killed Mihalis's men.
-How is this possible, sir?

01:19:06.084 --> 01:19:08.444
He still thinks Marya will serve him.

01:19:10.364 --> 01:19:12.084
If we find Marya's contact,

01:19:12.884 --> 01:19:14.204
we'll find them too, sir.

01:19:15.284 --> 01:19:16.444
Go now, Lukas.

01:19:18.244 --> 01:19:19.244
Kill them all.

01:19:19.684 --> 01:19:21.364
-All of them.
-Yes, sir.

01:19:24.004 --> 01:19:25.044
Door!

01:19:33.764 --> 01:19:34.764
Marya...

01:19:37.484 --> 01:19:38.484
Marya.

01:19:39.924 --> 01:19:41.764
You'll tell me everything, Marya.

01:19:43.764 --> 01:19:44.764
Everything.

01:20:07.884 --> 01:20:08.924
<i>Permission?</i>

01:20:12.724 --> 01:20:13.724
Come in.

01:20:18.684 --> 01:20:19.684
Come.

01:20:20.084 --> 01:20:21.084
Come.

01:20:24.124 --> 01:20:26.244
The food is almost ready.

01:20:26.804 --> 01:20:27.804
We'll eat together.

01:20:28.244 --> 01:20:29.484
Thank you, Bamsi.

01:20:32.204 --> 01:20:34.244
But we're not here for that.

01:20:36.684 --> 01:20:39.084
We came to discuss something
important with you.

01:20:40.844 --> 01:20:42.844
Good, go ahead.

01:20:43.444 --> 01:20:45.524
Come, Halime Hatun, Artuk Bey.

01:20:56.204 --> 01:20:57.204
Bamsi,

01:20:57.924 --> 01:21:00.204
we feel your pain.

01:21:01.844 --> 01:21:05.124
You did everything you could
for Ertuğrul Bey.

01:21:06.524 --> 01:21:07.524
But...

01:21:08.044 --> 01:21:09.764
you can't change fate.

01:21:10.324 --> 01:21:11.644
Get a hold of yourself.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:13.284
Get well.

01:21:14.044 --> 01:21:15.524
Remember your duty.

01:21:18.524 --> 01:21:19.524
Duty...

01:21:20.164 --> 01:21:21.164
Artuk Bey...

01:21:22.164 --> 01:21:23.964
What is this duty?

01:21:25.124 --> 01:21:28.204
Dündar Bey wants to sell our rightful
Hanli Bazaar.

01:21:30.404 --> 01:21:33.324
And will make us migrate
to Gündoğdu Bey's village.

01:21:35.044 --> 01:21:37.324
It's time to rise up, Bamsi.

01:21:38.924 --> 01:21:40.724
If we don't rise up,

01:21:41.804 --> 01:21:43.604
our cause will be forgotten.

01:21:46.724 --> 01:21:48.404
Both me and Halime Sultan

01:21:48.644 --> 01:21:52.564
will do our best to reverse Dündar Bey's
decision.

01:21:53.524 --> 01:21:55.524
We need all our comrades

01:21:55.684 --> 01:21:57.804
to stand with us, Bamsi.

01:21:59.044 --> 01:22:00.924
Anything can be forgotten,

01:22:01.644 --> 01:22:02.644
but the cause...

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:04.084
the cause can't be.

01:22:06.124 --> 01:22:08.484
I'm ready... to do anything

01:22:08.804 --> 01:22:10.524
that you need.

01:22:13.284 --> 01:22:15.644
Tell me, what can I do to

01:22:15.884 --> 01:22:17.884
prevent this calamity?

01:22:18.644 --> 01:22:19.804
Tell me.

01:22:26.164 --> 01:22:27.924
Artuk Bey will not rest idly.

01:22:29.764 --> 01:22:31.284
He'll try to undo my decision

01:22:31.884 --> 01:22:33.604
with Halime Hatun.

01:22:35.404 --> 01:22:37.884
They'll go to all the Alps and beys.

01:22:38.364 --> 01:22:39.924
What should we do, Dündar Bey?

01:22:40.284 --> 01:22:42.484
We have to talk to every Alp

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:44.604
and every bey, one by one

01:22:44.884 --> 01:22:46.044
to convince them.

01:22:47.924 --> 01:22:50.444
Balaban Bey and Elkoca Bey have doubts.

01:22:51.564 --> 01:22:53.204
I'll talk to them personally

01:22:53.564 --> 01:22:54.844
and convince them.

01:22:57.084 --> 01:22:58.084
Giresun Bey,

01:22:58.684 --> 01:23:00.124
İnanç Bey is your brother-in-law.

01:23:00.804 --> 01:23:02.084
He'll listen to you.

01:23:03.084 --> 01:23:05.284
Convince him before the council begins.

01:23:05.884 --> 01:23:07.004
As you command.

01:23:07.124 --> 01:23:08.124
Thank you.

01:23:08.644 --> 01:23:09.644
Say that staying...

01:23:11.124 --> 01:23:12.484
means losing money.

01:23:13.724 --> 01:23:14.724
Yes.

01:23:15.364 --> 01:23:17.524
But if we sell the bazaar, the gold...

01:23:18.244 --> 01:23:21.324
will be spent for our village.

01:23:22.004 --> 01:23:23.244
We'll have more animals.

01:23:24.964 --> 01:23:25.964
When we migrate,

01:23:26.524 --> 01:23:27.924
the Kayi villages will unite

01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:29.884
and become stronger.

01:23:32.244 --> 01:23:33.524
Tell that to everyone.

01:23:33.884 --> 01:23:35.244
As you say.

01:23:43.204 --> 01:23:45.124
Bamsi, the council is tomorrow.

01:23:46.324 --> 01:23:48.204
Artuk Bey is a candidate.

01:23:49.844 --> 01:23:52.244
We need the Alps and the beys on our side.

01:23:52.644 --> 01:23:54.404
The Alps respect you.

01:23:55.044 --> 01:23:56.164
They listen to you.

01:23:56.844 --> 01:23:57.964
Speak to them.

01:23:58.444 --> 01:24:00.844
Speak with the beys supporting Dündar Bey

01:24:01.324 --> 01:24:04.444
and convince them to stop supporting him.

01:24:05.044 --> 01:24:07.324
All right. All right, Halime Hatun.

01:24:07.604 --> 01:24:09.604
All right, don't you worry.

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:12.204
I'll speak with all of them.

01:24:12.404 --> 01:24:13.404
I'll do it.

01:24:14.924 --> 01:24:16.484
I'll talk to the women,

01:24:16.924 --> 01:24:19.284
so that they can convince
their husbands

01:24:19.644 --> 01:24:21.684
not to support Dündar Bey.

01:24:21.884 --> 01:24:23.404
I'll do my best

01:24:23.684 --> 01:24:25.684
to help you, Halime Hatun.

01:24:26.204 --> 01:24:27.204
Thanks, Hafsa.

01:24:27.764 --> 01:24:29.564
I'll talk to each bey.

01:24:30.164 --> 01:24:32.644
I'll tell them all the troubles we'll have

01:24:33.124 --> 01:24:35.644
if Dündar Bey has his way.

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:37.964
If we don't prevent this,

01:24:38.604 --> 01:24:41.284
all our martyrs will curse us.

01:24:43.444 --> 01:24:46.564
This is an issue of life and death
for the village, Bamsi.

01:24:47.684 --> 01:24:49.564
The duty falls on all of us.

01:24:50.324 --> 01:24:51.324
The duty...

01:24:51.884 --> 01:24:53.884
falls on all of us, Halime Hatun.

01:24:54.364 --> 01:24:57.124
Don't you worry.

01:24:57.404 --> 01:25:00.324
I'll do my best.

01:25:00.884 --> 01:25:01.924
Yeah...

01:25:02.084 --> 01:25:03.364
I'll do my best.

01:25:28.244 --> 01:25:29.244
Marya.

01:25:32.964 --> 01:25:34.284
Either you speak now,

01:25:35.844 --> 01:25:36.844
or never.

01:25:37.844 --> 01:25:40.124
I beg you, don't do anything.
I'm innocent.

01:25:40.684 --> 01:25:41.684
Marya.

01:25:43.444 --> 01:25:44.444
Marya.

01:25:45.524 --> 01:25:46.524
Talk to me.

01:25:47.124 --> 01:25:48.364
Your life depends on it.

01:25:49.764 --> 01:25:50.964
I can still forgive you.

01:25:52.244 --> 01:25:53.844
I can still love you.

01:25:55.564 --> 01:25:57.004
Just tell me the truth.

01:25:57.604 --> 01:25:59.044
Don't do anything to me.

01:26:00.244 --> 01:26:02.284
Have mercy, I'm innocent.

01:26:03.804 --> 01:26:04.804
Marya.

01:26:05.324 --> 01:26:06.324
Talk.

01:26:07.324 --> 01:26:08.364
Last chance.

01:26:12.604 --> 01:26:13.604
I'll talk.

01:26:14.964 --> 01:26:15.964
Don't do anything.

01:26:16.844 --> 01:26:17.844
I'll talk.

01:26:20.484 --> 01:26:22.484
Simko had a man.

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:24.804
Antheus.

01:26:26.244 --> 01:26:27.764
He made me do it all.

01:26:29.724 --> 01:26:34.084
He gave me to Simko, to send me
to your castle as a slave.

01:26:37.164 --> 01:26:38.284
He wanted me to...

01:26:39.124 --> 01:26:41.524
hang that letter on your door.

01:26:42.444 --> 01:26:43.644
Why wait this long?

01:26:46.164 --> 01:26:47.404
That Turk they have,

01:26:48.644 --> 01:26:50.644
they waited to cure him.

01:26:55.364 --> 01:26:56.844
You betrayed me, Marya.

01:26:58.364 --> 01:26:59.684
Please forgive me.

01:27:00.684 --> 01:27:01.684
I had to.

01:27:03.524 --> 01:27:07.284
They threatened to kill my little brother
they have as a hostage.

01:27:07.964 --> 01:27:08.964
This Antheus...

01:27:11.364 --> 01:27:12.524
Where is he?

01:27:13.604 --> 01:27:15.884
Save my brother, please.

01:27:16.884 --> 01:27:18.924
We'll serve you until we die.

01:27:23.604 --> 01:27:24.804
I won't let you perish.

01:27:26.364 --> 01:27:28.164
Since they've trapped you,

01:27:29.524 --> 01:27:31.724
I'll save you from them.

01:27:32.404 --> 01:27:33.404
Tell me.

01:27:34.444 --> 01:27:35.964
Where is this Antheus?

01:28:47.404 --> 01:28:49.284
Master Simko, Antheus sent the men.

01:28:50.164 --> 01:28:51.164
And the letter?

01:28:52.004 --> 01:28:53.004
Was it delivered?

01:28:53.524 --> 01:28:54.964
Ares has the letter.

01:28:55.404 --> 01:28:56.404
Marya did her job.

01:28:56.884 --> 01:28:57.884
Good.

01:28:59.364 --> 01:29:01.604
Now I have Ares in my hand.

01:29:03.124 --> 01:29:05.444
He'll give me back all my gold.

01:30:04.084 --> 01:30:05.204
They're numerous.

01:30:07.244 --> 01:30:08.404
We can't get away.

01:30:10.924 --> 01:30:14.324
I don't care about myself being a slave.
I'm only sad for you.

01:30:16.564 --> 01:30:17.644
Don't be sad...

01:30:18.644 --> 01:30:20.444
for anyone, Pito.

01:30:22.044 --> 01:30:25.364
There's always hope before death.

01:30:26.524 --> 01:30:27.524
We...

01:30:28.484 --> 01:30:30.644
just have to find it.

01:30:32.044 --> 01:30:33.044
Ertuğrul Bey,

01:30:33.284 --> 01:30:37.124
I can say that I've never seen
a braver man than you.

01:30:38.644 --> 01:30:40.444
But there's no more hope.

01:30:41.484 --> 01:30:42.604
All hope is gone.

01:30:44.244 --> 01:30:46.564
Hopelessness is a sin, Pito.

01:30:47.684 --> 01:30:49.204
We're ordered to never

01:30:49.604 --> 01:30:51.964
stop hoping for Allah's mercy.

01:30:54.964 --> 01:30:56.604
I don't fear death.

01:30:57.724 --> 01:30:58.724
But...

01:30:59.564 --> 01:31:02.004
if I die before using my last breath

01:31:02.724 --> 01:31:04.844
then I'll go to hell.

01:31:09.124 --> 01:31:10.124
What will you do?

01:31:17.884 --> 01:31:18.884
Tell the slaves...

01:31:19.884 --> 01:31:20.964
to get ready.

01:31:22.124 --> 01:31:23.884
We'll fight one last time.

01:31:37.364 --> 01:31:38.364
Get the slaves up.

01:31:38.764 --> 01:31:39.764
We're going.

01:32:16.284 --> 01:32:18.004
<i>Glorious and Holy Emperor,</i>

01:32:18.964 --> 01:32:21.684
<i>the Turkish villages on the border</i>
<i>are miserable</i>.

01:32:22.484 --> 01:32:26.484
<i>The Seljuk Emir Sadettin will do anything</i>
<i>for his own ends.</i>

01:32:27.324 --> 01:32:29.804
<i>For now, I'll run the Hanli bazaar</i>
<i>with him.</i>

01:32:30.764 --> 01:32:33.084
<i>But the bazaar will soon</i>
<i>be completely ours.</i>

01:32:34.484 --> 01:32:36.084
<i>For our holy goal,</i>

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:41.364
<i>it's time to destroy the Turks and take</i>
<i>back everything they've taken from us.</i>

01:32:42.604 --> 01:32:44.604
<i>I want you to send me...</i>

01:32:45.124 --> 01:32:47.004
<i>a great army, and someone worthy...</i>

01:32:47.844 --> 01:32:51.844
<i>to run the bazaar for the glorious victory</i>
<i>that awaits us.</i>

01:32:52.644 --> 01:32:54.044
<i>Your loyal servant,</i>

01:32:54.804 --> 01:32:55.884
<i>Tekfur Ares.</i>

01:34:09.564 --> 01:34:10.564
They're back.

01:34:27.564 --> 01:34:29.564
Welcome.

01:34:33.084 --> 01:34:34.764
Welcome, my bey.

01:34:35.684 --> 01:34:37.244
The brave warriors are back!

01:34:41.444 --> 01:34:43.444
Welcome, brave warriors!

01:34:52.484 --> 01:34:53.484
Thank you.

01:34:57.204 --> 01:34:58.844
At last, brothers.

01:35:08.844 --> 01:35:09.844
They have come.

01:35:10.884 --> 01:35:12.404
My brothers are back.

01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:14.124
Thank God.

01:35:15.404 --> 01:35:16.964
At long last,

01:35:18.804 --> 01:35:20.884
they have returned,

01:35:21.604 --> 01:35:22.604
thank God.

01:35:23.604 --> 01:35:25.604
Welcome.

01:35:35.284 --> 01:35:36.284
My sons.

01:35:37.124 --> 01:35:38.884
Welcome.

01:35:39.044 --> 01:35:40.324
Thank you, Mother.

01:35:47.364 --> 01:35:48.604
My son, my child.

01:35:49.004 --> 01:35:51.364
-Welcome, son.
-Let me hug you.

01:35:52.004 --> 01:35:53.004
My son...

01:36:09.364 --> 01:36:11.364
-Welcome Turgut.
-Thanks, Mother.

01:36:15.404 --> 01:36:17.364
-Our son is back.
-Welcome, son.

01:36:17.444 --> 01:36:18.604
My brave son.

01:36:19.044 --> 01:36:20.444
My brave son.

01:36:21.724 --> 01:36:23.164
Welcome, all of you.

01:36:23.884 --> 01:36:26.724
You've come back alive,
thank Allah.

01:36:27.364 --> 01:36:29.284
You've brought joy.

01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:31.644
Thank you.

01:36:32.964 --> 01:36:35.284
We did our duty

01:36:35.804 --> 01:36:37.884
to our Sultan and our state.

01:36:38.564 --> 01:36:40.004
We've proudly returned...

01:36:40.844 --> 01:36:41.964
to our village.

01:36:42.164 --> 01:36:43.404
<i>Welcome!</i>

01:36:51.644 --> 01:36:53.044
Welcome.

01:36:53.684 --> 01:36:55.564
You've brought us joy.

01:36:56.164 --> 01:36:57.844
You've made our village happy.

01:36:58.484 --> 01:36:59.484
Thank you.

01:37:03.364 --> 01:37:05.084
-Turgut Alp.
-Artuk Bey.

01:37:06.564 --> 01:37:07.564
Welcome.

01:37:10.364 --> 01:37:11.444
Welcome.

01:37:13.004 --> 01:37:14.244
Welcome, son.

01:37:18.404 --> 01:37:20.404
-Welcome.
-Thank you, Mother.

01:37:39.044 --> 01:37:40.364
Good to see you, brother.

01:37:41.004 --> 01:37:43.524
You've unleashed hell upon the enemy

01:37:44.364 --> 01:37:45.364
and come back, huh?

01:37:46.284 --> 01:37:49.924
-We did, brother.
-Well done, brother.

01:37:51.644 --> 01:37:53.404
You seem well.

01:37:55.644 --> 01:37:56.924
You've gotten better.

01:37:57.724 --> 01:37:58.724
I did, indeed.

01:37:59.124 --> 01:38:00.124
I did.

01:38:06.724 --> 01:38:08.284
<i>Welcome.</i>

01:38:09.964 --> 01:38:11.764
Thank Allah.

01:38:13.564 --> 01:38:14.644
<i>You're like a lion.</i>

01:38:14.964 --> 01:38:15.964
What's the matter?

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:18.484
Why have they gathered?

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:25.644
We're electing a bey, Turgut Alp.

01:38:30.724 --> 01:38:32.004
We'll talk in the tent.

01:38:32.844 --> 01:38:33.884
Get some rest.

01:38:34.484 --> 01:38:35.884
We'll talk inside.

01:39:54.884 --> 01:39:56.084
The pain left behind...

01:39:56.644 --> 01:39:58.084
by our Ertuğrul Bey...

01:39:59.044 --> 01:40:01.284
is still fresh, Turgut Alp.

01:40:03.484 --> 01:40:04.684
So fresh that...

01:40:06.044 --> 01:40:08.164
Dündar Bey wants us to...

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:13.764
leave everything behind and migrate to
the village of...

01:40:14.324 --> 01:40:15.364
Gündoğdu Bey.

01:40:36.124 --> 01:40:37.124
Mother Hayme.

01:40:44.924 --> 01:40:45.924
Dündar Bey.

01:40:47.524 --> 01:40:48.844
Is Halime Hatun right?

01:40:49.964 --> 01:40:51.364
The council is for this?

01:40:53.244 --> 01:40:54.284
We wish to sell...

01:40:55.244 --> 01:40:56.644
the bazaar to unite the Kayis.

01:40:57.564 --> 01:40:58.564
As they were before.

01:40:59.244 --> 01:41:01.164
We wish to be one and strong.

01:41:05.644 --> 01:41:06.644
We...

01:41:07.604 --> 01:41:10.244
fought alongside Ertuğrul Bey for years.

01:41:13.244 --> 01:41:14.404
We lost many men.

01:41:20.164 --> 01:41:21.444
If we do this,

01:41:22.964 --> 01:41:25.524
won't we betray his memory, Dündar Bey?

01:41:28.484 --> 01:41:31.004
Of course... That's betrayal, brother.

01:41:31.204 --> 01:41:32.204
It sure is.

01:41:32.644 --> 01:41:34.884
When Ertuğrul Bey fell,

01:41:35.684 --> 01:41:37.644
our village had troubles, Turgut.

01:41:39.124 --> 01:41:41.164
Dündar Bey had this decision to make.

01:41:43.084 --> 01:41:46.164
The Kayis must be united.

01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:53.444
Artuk Bey is against
Dündar Bey's decision

01:41:54.284 --> 01:41:55.284
and wishes to be...

01:41:57.324 --> 01:41:58.804
the bey himself.

01:42:01.324 --> 01:42:02.564
The council will decide.

01:42:07.724 --> 01:42:10.204
Aslıhan Hatun has a problem too.

01:42:10.764 --> 01:42:12.204
Her uncle Bahadır Bey came.

01:42:13.004 --> 01:42:14.884
He wishes to migrate
with his village.

01:42:17.444 --> 01:42:18.564
Who is Bahadır Bey?

01:42:20.804 --> 01:42:21.964
Is he good?

01:42:22.964 --> 01:42:24.684
Not at all, Turgut Alp.

01:42:24.924 --> 01:42:26.244
The same as Ural.

01:42:32.444 --> 01:42:33.444
Mother Hayme.

01:42:34.604 --> 01:42:35.604
Dündar Bey.

01:42:36.924 --> 01:42:38.484
The Alps just returned from war.

01:42:39.844 --> 01:42:40.964
We have martyrs.

01:42:42.004 --> 01:42:44.204
Let's not abandon their families
on this day.

01:42:48.324 --> 01:42:51.564
You should be with them,
with the men.

01:42:56.684 --> 01:42:58.484
If you agree, Dündar Bey,

01:43:00.004 --> 01:43:02.804
the council should be tomorrow.

01:43:03.324 --> 01:43:05.324
That would be better, Dündar Bey.

01:43:06.484 --> 01:43:10.244
We can't have a council
with the families in mourning.

01:43:16.644 --> 01:43:17.644
As you say.

01:43:18.684 --> 01:43:20.764
I agree that it should be postponed.

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:24.564
Thank you.

01:43:25.564 --> 01:43:27.684
I have to get to the Cavdar Village.

01:43:28.404 --> 01:43:29.804
They have martyrs too.

01:43:30.084 --> 01:43:31.244
I have to give them...

01:43:31.884 --> 01:43:33.284
their dead and my condolences.

01:43:35.324 --> 01:43:37.684
May they rest in peace.

01:43:38.724 --> 01:43:39.724
Amen.

01:43:43.284 --> 01:43:44.524
Brother.

01:43:45.084 --> 01:43:48.764
I'll come along. I'll accompany you.

01:43:51.724 --> 01:43:53.124
I'll go alone, brother.

01:43:54.444 --> 01:43:55.844
You go to your Alps.

01:43:58.404 --> 01:43:59.404
All right.

01:44:16.278 --> 01:44:18.078
God bless your hands, Hatun.

01:44:19.238 --> 01:44:21.718
It's a table worthy of an Emir.

01:44:22.358 --> 01:44:24.478
You can tell how triumphant a bey is
by his table.

01:44:24.798 --> 01:44:27.358
I'll set up many more amazing tables
for you, my bey.

01:44:43.398 --> 01:44:45.878
What do you think you're doing
in my pavilion, Bahadir Bey?

01:44:46.718 --> 01:44:48.758
Majesty Emir is visiting.

01:44:49.758 --> 01:44:52.918
I'm throwing a banquet for him,
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:44:53.838 --> 01:44:56.638
Why didn't I know about his visit?

01:44:59.758 --> 01:45:00.878
He told me.

01:45:02.758 --> 01:45:05.118
The two of us were talking alone.

01:45:05.798 --> 01:45:07.678
I'm the hatun of the people.

01:45:08.438 --> 01:45:09.598
And the pavilion is mine.

01:45:10.118 --> 01:45:13.718
If Majesty Emir visits,
I should be the first one to know.

01:45:14.638 --> 01:45:16.718
If someone is throwing a banquet,

01:45:17.198 --> 01:45:18.238
that should be me.

01:45:18.358 --> 01:45:19.478
Enough.

01:45:20.718 --> 01:45:22.078
If you are a hatun,

01:45:23.318 --> 01:45:24.398
I'm a bey.

01:45:24.798 --> 01:45:28.598
From now on, this is my pavilion too.

01:45:31.998 --> 01:45:33.238
How...

01:45:33.878 --> 01:45:34.918
dare you?

01:45:41.918 --> 01:45:43.318
Majesty Emir has arrived, Bey.

01:47:12.678 --> 01:47:14.998
Take this letter to the castle
and give it to Marya.

01:47:16.598 --> 01:47:18.718
This time, leave the letter
on Ares' throne.

01:47:19.038 --> 01:47:21.118
Let Ares know we mean business.

01:47:21.478 --> 01:47:24.438
His knees will go weak
when he hears that he's paying

01:47:24.878 --> 01:47:26.398
10,000 gold coins to take to Ertuğrul.

01:47:27.038 --> 01:47:29.598
I'll make you eat that letter
before you die, Antheus.

01:47:30.598 --> 01:47:32.438
Ares, catch him!

01:48:05.398 --> 01:48:06.398
Simko.

01:48:07.438 --> 01:48:10.278
Where did he take Ertuğrul?
Tell me everything.

01:48:10.918 --> 01:48:12.958
I'll tell you everything, sir.

01:48:13.518 --> 01:48:14.798
Please spare my life.

01:48:16.158 --> 01:48:17.998
Where did Simko take Ertuğrul?

01:48:20.678 --> 01:48:22.758
Spare my life, sir.

01:48:23.078 --> 01:48:24.518
He told me to wait here.

01:48:25.118 --> 01:48:27.198
He'd bring Ertuğrul here.

01:48:28.398 --> 01:48:30.518
He's bringing Ertuğrul here, huh?

01:48:31.678 --> 01:48:32.718
Prepare yourselves!

01:48:33.998 --> 01:48:35.198
We'll wait here.

01:48:45.518 --> 01:48:47.718
There's a young man
that's chained up, sir.

01:50:14.518 --> 01:50:17.358
Look at that,
new slaves fell into our laps.

01:50:26.278 --> 01:50:27.358
Surround them.

01:50:35.118 --> 01:50:36.318
Such a shame.

01:50:36.478 --> 01:50:38.238
They'll become slaves, just like us.

01:50:38.358 --> 01:50:40.318
We need men, Pito.

01:50:40.918 --> 01:50:42.078
That's good.

01:50:43.118 --> 01:50:44.158
There'll be more of us.

01:50:45.278 --> 01:50:46.398
Look at me.

01:50:46.998 --> 01:50:49.318
From now on,
I own everything that belongs to you.

01:50:50.478 --> 01:50:52.398
You're my prisoners now.

01:50:53.998 --> 01:50:55.318
Take the four in the back.

01:50:55.758 --> 01:50:58.158
Kill the cripple, he won't be any good.

01:52:04.918 --> 01:52:06.438
Are you Marya's brother?

01:52:08.598 --> 01:52:09.718
Yes, sir.

01:52:11.718 --> 01:52:12.838
My sister Marya...

01:52:14.238 --> 01:52:15.278
Is she okay?

01:52:16.118 --> 01:52:17.558
You'll never know.

01:52:28.718 --> 01:52:29.918
Bring Marya here.

01:52:30.198 --> 01:52:31.278
Yes, sir!

01:52:37.118 --> 01:52:38.238
Attack!

01:53:07.918 --> 01:53:09.838
May your table be blessed, Bahadir Bey.

01:53:10.838 --> 01:53:12.878
The food is so delicious.

01:53:13.838 --> 01:53:15.438
Enjoy your supper, Majesty Emir.

01:53:15.838 --> 01:53:17.158
From now on,

01:53:17.758 --> 01:53:21.798
I will throw many more banquets
for you, if God lets me.

01:53:23.318 --> 01:53:24.438
God willing.

01:53:26.958 --> 01:53:28.078
So...

01:53:29.158 --> 01:53:31.238
Bahadir Bey's group will be here soon.

01:53:31.758 --> 01:53:34.358
When will you establish
the Council of Beys?

01:53:35.118 --> 01:53:38.358
I'll have to talk to my beys first.

01:53:39.358 --> 01:53:42.478
If they decide on merging two groups,

01:53:43.198 --> 01:53:45.158
I'll do what's necessary
for the Beylic council.

01:53:48.318 --> 01:53:52.198
Many Turk nomad groups
have departed to immigrate

01:53:52.598 --> 01:53:54.798
to these lands with our sultan's order.

01:53:55.398 --> 01:54:00.278
Likewise, Bahadir Bey
came here on our sultan's command.

01:54:00.838 --> 01:54:05.398
So whatever you
and your beys decide on,

01:54:05.718 --> 01:54:08.158
Bahadir Bey will settle down here.

01:54:10.598 --> 01:54:14.398
There's nothing
we can do if there's an order.

01:54:15.198 --> 01:54:18.598
However my Ertuğrul Bey
and Aliyar Bey have their legacies.

01:54:19.478 --> 01:54:23.678
To serve our government
we'll unite with the Kayis.

01:54:24.358 --> 01:54:27.918
And I have no desire
to leave the Beylic for this will.

01:54:29.638 --> 01:54:31.918
You're dragging your feet, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:54:32.878 --> 01:54:34.838
You're still talking about the Kayi.

01:54:36.038 --> 01:54:37.278
The Kayis will immigrate.

01:54:37.958 --> 01:54:40.758
Bahadir Bey will take over the bazaar.

01:54:42.598 --> 01:54:43.798
Think about your own people.

01:54:44.078 --> 01:54:46.078
The Kayis haven't immigrated yet,

01:54:46.558 --> 01:54:48.638
nor has Bahadir Bey taken over
the Hanlı Bazaar.

01:54:49.398 --> 01:54:51.278
Don’t count your chickens
before they hatch.

01:54:57.238 --> 01:55:00.078
She's hiding behind the Kayis,

01:55:00.398 --> 01:55:04.678
to top it off she got engaged
to their man as a Cavdar woman

01:55:05.118 --> 01:55:07.238
who has Bey blood in her.

01:55:07.438 --> 01:55:09.558
Don't overstep the line, Bahadir Bey.

01:55:09.758 --> 01:55:13.838
You're the one to overstepping
by rejecting tradition,

01:55:14.158 --> 01:55:15.358
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:55:19.358 --> 01:55:20.998
<i>If you'll excuse me, Majesty Emir.</i>

01:55:26.838 --> 01:55:29.278
Aslıhan Hatun, Turgut Alp has arrived.

01:55:29.478 --> 01:55:31.678
He wants to come in if you'll let him.

01:55:32.638 --> 01:55:33.998
Let him come in, Kırca.

01:55:35.438 --> 01:55:36.678
He should come right in.

01:55:41.238 --> 01:55:42.358
Guards.

01:56:05.358 --> 01:56:06.478
Peace be with you.

01:56:08.358 --> 01:56:09.358
Peace be upon you.

01:56:11.398 --> 01:56:12.478
Peace be upon you.

01:58:14.758 --> 01:58:17.998
We got to the border with the Cavdar men

01:58:18.438 --> 01:58:21.558
and fulfilled our mission justly,

01:58:22.158 --> 01:58:23.238
Majesty Emir.

01:58:24.838 --> 01:58:27.278
We haven't let those bandits

01:58:27.998 --> 01:58:32.118
who tried taking advantage
of our government being at war...

01:58:34.038 --> 01:58:35.358
to step into our lands.

01:58:37.358 --> 01:58:38.398
We heard about that.

01:58:39.238 --> 01:58:42.798
The bravery of you and your men
reached our ears.

01:58:43.558 --> 01:58:45.118
You have become the pride

01:58:45.718 --> 01:58:49.958
of our government
and relied upon by our sultan, Turgut Alp.

01:58:51.038 --> 01:58:52.158
Thank you.

01:58:52.918 --> 01:58:54.118
May our sultan...

01:58:54.878 --> 01:58:57.478
and our government stand tall.

01:59:03.438 --> 01:59:05.238
You've got seven casualties,
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:59:06.078 --> 01:59:08.078
We have carried out our last duty.

01:59:08.838 --> 01:59:10.518
We took their weapons to their families.

01:59:11.878 --> 01:59:12.878
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:59:14.438 --> 01:59:16.038
It's for our government,

01:59:16.438 --> 01:59:19.398
and our land we die for, Turgut Alp.

01:59:20.078 --> 01:59:22.038
May God never destroy that.

01:59:23.558 --> 01:59:25.038
Welcome.

01:59:26.518 --> 01:59:27.678
Thank you.

01:59:29.398 --> 01:59:33.758
I'd like to see you when you're available
to return your men to you,

01:59:33.918 --> 01:59:35.918
and to give you information,
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:59:41.318 --> 01:59:43.038
It's not the time for it,

01:59:44.598 --> 01:59:45.718
Commander.

01:59:49.198 --> 01:59:51.198
Aslıhan Hatun, sit down.

01:59:52.398 --> 01:59:54.758
We are consulting Majesty Emir here.

01:59:59.478 --> 02:00:02.078
I think our conversation is over,
Bahadir Bey.

02:00:02.838 --> 02:00:03.958
I said what's necessary.

02:00:09.158 --> 02:00:10.238
You leave...

02:00:11.438 --> 02:00:13.438
the presence of Majesty Emir...

02:00:14.598 --> 02:00:17.118
to talk to this commander.

02:00:17.718 --> 02:00:20.558
You don't have morals
nor do you follow tradition.

02:00:21.478 --> 02:00:23.438
You can't teach me about tradition.

02:00:23.998 --> 02:00:26.198
If the hatun of the pavilion
and the Emir is here

02:00:26.318 --> 02:00:28.718
your words mean nothing.

02:00:29.598 --> 02:00:30.878
How dare you!

02:00:44.158 --> 02:00:45.158
What do you want?

02:00:47.158 --> 02:00:48.478
Where are you travelling to?

02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:53.638
To Red Apple.

02:01:05.558 --> 02:01:06.838
Give me your name, brave man.

02:01:07.438 --> 02:01:08.358
Atsız.

02:01:11.198 --> 02:01:12.518
Come on, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:01:13.158 --> 02:01:14.318
It's the battle of freedom.

02:01:15.318 --> 02:01:16.318
Come on.

02:02:06.158 --> 02:02:09.438
Is it tradition to advance
towards a hatun that took over...

02:02:10.718 --> 02:02:12.118
the Beylic, Bahadir Bey?

02:02:12.998 --> 02:02:14.398
You have no manners!

02:02:15.558 --> 02:02:17.918
How dare you touch a bey?

02:02:21.278 --> 02:02:22.358
Turgut!

02:03:49.318 --> 02:03:50.598
Ertuğrul Bey, he's running.

02:03:57.798 --> 02:03:59.798
Go after that scumbag.

02:03:59.918 --> 02:04:01.478
We'll take care of ourselves.

02:04:04.878 --> 02:04:05.918
You're all free.

02:04:08.998 --> 02:04:10.358
Godspeed to you.

02:04:10.438 --> 02:04:12.558
May God protect you, Ertuğrul Bey.

02:04:16.438 --> 02:04:17.598
Come on, brave men. After him.

02:04:22.798 --> 02:04:24.358
Come on, brave men.

02:04:30.958 --> 02:04:31.918
Giddy up!

02:04:35.678 --> 02:04:37.678
Giddy up!

02:04:42.158 --> 02:04:43.758
God help you, Turkish Bey.

02:04:44.918 --> 02:04:46.118
I'll never forget you.
