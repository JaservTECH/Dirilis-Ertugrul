00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 93 will start after 12:40 min.

13:45.927 --> 13:48.967
Brother, do you miss our father?

13:49.407 --> 13:50.847
I miss him a lot.

14:26.047 --> 14:27.247
Brother...

14:27.767 --> 14:29.567
This smells like my father.

14:32.647 --> 14:34.527
I smell it whenever I miss him.

14:35.767 --> 14:37.407
Here, you should smell it too.

14:43.847 --> 14:45.687
Don't you be sad, okay?

14:45.967 --> 14:48.487
Big brothers don't get sad.
Look at me.

15:11.207 --> 15:12.647
Mother, why are you crying?

15:17.927 --> 15:19.727
I'm not crying, my Gündüz.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.167
Don't cry, mother.
Don't be afraid.

15:24.287 --> 15:26.607
I'll protect you and my brother.

15:28.327 --> 15:29.767
I know, my Gündüz.

15:30.807 --> 15:33.407
You can protect me and your brother.

15:34.687 --> 15:36.767
You are a great Alp commander.

15:37.527 --> 15:41.207
My father entrusted you to me
when he was leaving for the battle.

15:49.567 --> 15:51.327
That's right, my Gündüz.

15:52.487 --> 15:54.327
He did.

16:22.647 --> 16:24.807
The horses can rest here, Ertuğrul Bey.

16:25.487 --> 16:27.247
We can stay the night in the village.

16:27.407 --> 16:29.927
I know some people there.
We'll be comfortable.

16:44.567 --> 16:45.687
Ho!

17:55.847 --> 17:56.727
Hush!

18:40.847 --> 18:42.207
Ertuğrul Bey...

18:45.647 --> 18:48.087
Antheus took care of you well.

18:48.847 --> 18:51.527
I wasn't expecting you to be this healthy.

18:52.767 --> 18:55.007
You said we had a long way to go.

18:55.167 --> 18:58.487
But as you can see, it wasn't that long.

19:16.407 --> 19:18.807
As caravansaries are raided,
the merchants are running away.

19:20.127 --> 19:23.807
Kayıs can't deal with the bandits.
They don't know what to do.

19:24.407 --> 19:27.807
Neither my people nor Turks can find
what they are looking for in the bazaar.

19:28.407 --> 19:31.287
I kept my promise, Tekfur Ares.
Now it's your turn.

19:31.887 --> 19:35.407
A big caravansary that left from Iran
should be here soon.

19:36.647 --> 19:40.327
From Mosul, Aleppo and even China...

19:41.367 --> 19:44.847
All caravansaries that pass by here

19:45.527 --> 19:49.167
have to pass through Hanlı Bazaar
by my command.

19:50.287 --> 19:52.647
Before gold starts accumulating
in Hanlı Bazaar,

19:53.487 --> 19:55.607
the bazaar has to be
taken away from the Kayıs.

19:56.207 --> 19:58.247
Or I'll burn that bazaar down
with my own hands.

19:58.367 --> 20:00.087
Be at ease, Tekfur Ares.

20:02.087 --> 20:05.487
Dündar will ask for my help
when he gets in trouble.

20:06.807 --> 20:09.527
And I'll encourage him to sell the bazaar.

20:10.407 --> 20:14.887
And I'll make a man that I trust
buy the bazaar.

20:16.207 --> 20:18.007
By then, everything will have changed.

20:18.367 --> 20:19.287
So...

20:19.887 --> 20:22.727
We'll run this bazaar together
through this man, huh?

20:22.807 --> 20:27.167
Yes, you'll pay for the bazaar's value.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.407
If you'll buy the bazaar with my gold,
Emir Sadettin,

20:37.487 --> 20:40.287
then I'd like my own man
to run the bazaar.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.687
I want to bury my gold in the bazaar,
not in the soil.

20:45.607 --> 20:48.487
I'll get one of the most skillful
merchants from Nicaea to run the bazaar.

20:49.487 --> 20:50.567
That's my only condition.

20:58.127 --> 21:01.407
If the merchants from the east are
in your pocket,

21:01.887 --> 21:05.367
Greek and French merchants are in mine,
Emir Sadettin.

21:05.927 --> 21:07.487
If you want partnership, this is it.

21:07.807 --> 21:08.727
<i>Simfono!</i>

21:22.927 --> 21:25.127
<i>Ne. Simfono,</i> Ares.

21:39.567 --> 21:42.967
Emir Sadettin, I'll introduce you
to my favorite woman.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.127
Welcome, sir.

21:46.887 --> 21:47.887
I'm honored.

21:51.767 --> 21:54.007
You know how to own beautiful things.

21:54.607 --> 21:55.807
I like it.

22:04.887 --> 22:06.487
I've eaten enough.

22:09.167 --> 22:11.647
I'll leave you alone with your beauties.

22:16.567 --> 22:19.407
Don't waste any time, go see Dündar,
press him.

22:19.607 --> 22:21.887
While the fire is burning,
we should add more fuel to it.

22:43.447 --> 22:45.127
Now surrender to your new owner Simko

22:45.487 --> 22:48.567
who found you and helped you
recover and escape death.

22:49.407 --> 22:52.687
From now on, I own your life.

22:53.887 --> 22:59.407
I'd rather die than be a slave
for you rascals.

23:03.527 --> 23:04.447
So...

23:05.847 --> 23:07.247
If that's what you want...

23:10.207 --> 23:11.127
Get him!

24:36.447 --> 24:40.247
The sparkle in your eye is a sign
of the new order that you've established.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.887
To reestablish the order
that he demolished

24:46.367 --> 24:49.807
is the binding duty
of any great statesman.

24:50.127 --> 24:52.727
You have proven that once again,
Majesty Emir.

24:53.767 --> 24:57.767
Moreover, you laid the entire burden
upon your biggest enemy, Ares.

24:58.767 --> 25:02.447
Already, his mercenary soldiers are
creating trouble for Dündar Bey.

25:03.847 --> 25:06.007
My biggest enemy was Ertuğrul.

25:07.887 --> 25:11.647
I'll build my reign out of his ashes.

25:12.847 --> 25:14.807
What about Ares, Majesty Emir?

25:16.647 --> 25:19.127
He'll eventually figure out
that he was tricked.

25:23.247 --> 25:27.687
After our Sultan's victory,
it'll be Karacahisar's turn.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.047
Don't worry.

25:30.647 --> 25:34.487
I'll bury Ares in the same land
that I buried Ertuğrul.

25:37.447 --> 25:39.687
What about Bahadır Bey?

25:40.167 --> 25:41.447
He should be here soon.

25:41.567 --> 25:42.487
Good.

25:43.727 --> 25:45.047
Let him come.

25:45.887 --> 25:46.967
Let him.

25:47.287 --> 25:49.727
I'll buy the bazaar with Ares' gold

25:50.247 --> 25:52.527
and I'll make sure
Bahadır Bey becomes powerful

25:52.967 --> 25:56.087
and becomes a frontiersman
under my command.

25:57.927 --> 26:00.487
What matters is our state.

26:02.407 --> 26:05.047
That'll be the thing to last, Göktuğ.

26:09.847 --> 26:12.687
I'll always kneel before our state,
Majesty Emir.

26:46.487 --> 26:48.687
I had my biggest victory today, Marya.

26:50.447 --> 26:53.727
I bought this necklace for you
so we'll never forget this day.

27:08.287 --> 27:12.887
The biggest gift I can receive is
your victory, Tekfur Ares.

27:20.047 --> 27:21.127
What? What do you want?

27:21.687 --> 27:22.647
Sir...

27:23.247 --> 27:24.207
Mihalis is here.

27:26.447 --> 27:27.687
Let him come in.

27:31.887 --> 27:34.967
Go to our room, wait for me.
I'll be there soon.

27:49.647 --> 27:51.047
You called for me, Tekfur Ares.

27:53.567 --> 27:55.407
I want bigger raids, Mihalis.

27:55.647 --> 27:59.327
Get more men. Don't think about the gold.
I'll take care of it.

27:59.407 --> 28:03.207
Just make sure the terror you'll spread
is enough to suffocate the Turks.

28:03.727 --> 28:05.767
As you wish, Tekfur Ares.

28:08.407 --> 28:09.367
Lukas!

28:10.367 --> 28:12.607
Double the men we have on the border.

28:12.927 --> 28:14.087
Have them spread out.

28:14.687 --> 28:17.167
Have them kill all the wandering Turks.

28:17.247 --> 28:20.247
I want them to be scared
of leaving their villages, got it?

28:20.567 --> 28:21.887
Yes, Tekfur Ares.

28:22.207 --> 28:24.527
We're so close to breaking the back
of the Turks, Lukas.

28:25.567 --> 28:26.687
I don't want any mistakes.

28:29.407 --> 28:30.447
Hah!

28:31.807 --> 28:33.287
Send a message to Dündar Bey.

28:33.687 --> 28:36.167
-I'll see him in Hanlı Bazaar.
-Yes, sir.

29:23.087 --> 29:25.727
It's time to upset Ares.

29:27.127 --> 29:29.287
The pigeon in the castle should start
moving too.

29:29.967 --> 29:33.247
This way Ares will find out Ertuğrul
is still alive

29:33.687 --> 29:36.607
and that he's not safe
even in his own castle.

29:37.567 --> 29:41.047
What if Ares doesn't pay
the gold we demand for Ertuğrul?

29:45.047 --> 29:47.287
Then Sultan Alaeddin will find out

29:47.447 --> 29:51.167
that his frontiersman was trapped
by Ares.

29:52.767 --> 29:55.127
Ares will be scared, not us.

29:55.607 --> 29:57.207
Now go and wait inside the cave.

30:27.647 --> 30:30.367
Oh, wow, Ertuğrul Bey...

30:32.887 --> 30:34.287
Look at you!

30:48.967 --> 30:52.407
Haven't you understood how much
compassion I have for you yet?

30:54.407 --> 30:56.167
Why did you resist my men?

30:57.167 --> 30:59.767
Don't think I surrendered, Simko.

31:06.527 --> 31:08.567
Even if you tie me up...

31:13.327 --> 31:15.287
I'd rip you apart with my teeth.

31:16.607 --> 31:20.967
Well, I'll rip your teeth out then.

31:26.247 --> 31:31.367
A merchant like you wouldn't waste
his time with a slave.

31:36.247 --> 31:37.287
Tell me.

31:38.167 --> 31:39.727
What do you want from me?

31:40.487 --> 31:41.687
You're a smart man.

31:43.927 --> 31:48.087
I know very well that you are too valuable
to be a galley slave.

31:48.927 --> 31:52.767
I have no desire to sell you
in the slave market like those hangdogs.

31:54.927 --> 31:58.007
We know who your owner is.

32:05.047 --> 32:09.247
You know who set me up.

32:11.807 --> 32:13.767
And you want to sell me to them?

32:17.047 --> 32:18.327
Ah...

32:19.527 --> 32:21.367
You're so smart, Ertuğrul Bey.

32:22.447 --> 32:26.967
So smart. But don't worry,
you'll figure everything out

32:27.567 --> 32:28.927
when I sell you to him.

32:34.127 --> 32:35.447
Get up! We're leaving!

32:35.807 --> 32:36.727
Come on!

32:37.047 --> 32:38.007
Come on!

32:38.327 --> 32:41.007
Get up! We're leaving! Come on!

32:43.007 --> 32:44.367
Come on!

32:57.967 --> 32:59.047
Quick!

33:21.127 --> 33:23.447
-Good luck with that.
-Thank you, Bey.

33:23.847 --> 33:25.447
How is your business, Merchant?

33:26.007 --> 33:30.647
How could it be, Bey? It's been really bad
since the bandits started to raid.

33:31.567 --> 33:33.567
How long will this go on for, Bey?

33:33.927 --> 33:36.047
When will security be established?

33:41.527 --> 33:42.727
Don't worry.

33:43.407 --> 33:45.607
We'll try with God's help.

33:47.247 --> 33:50.447
The bazaar will go back
to its former order as soon as possible.

33:52.607 --> 33:54.487
-Have a good day.
-Thank you, Bey.

33:59.607 --> 34:01.687
My Bey, don't you worry.

34:01.767 --> 34:06.487
Merchants think their worlds turn
upside down when business is bad.

34:06.927 --> 34:09.447
With God's help,
everything will get better.

34:10.727 --> 34:12.207
You say that, Artuk Bey...

34:13.887 --> 34:15.407
They're not wrong.

34:16.247 --> 34:18.727
We can't stop the bandits.

34:19.047 --> 34:21.647
Day by day, it's getting more and more
difficult for us to stop it.

34:21.847 --> 34:23.327
Dündar Bey is right.

34:23.407 --> 34:25.767
The bandit incident has shaken up
the revenue of the bazaar.

34:25.927 --> 34:27.527
Everyone's income has decreased.

34:27.847 --> 34:29.727
Both the merchants
and the customers are uneasy.

34:29.927 --> 34:32.927
-I don't know what to do.
-Every cloud has a silver lining.

34:33.047 --> 34:35.807
Our duty is to maintain the peace.

34:36.327 --> 34:38.727
Greek merchants have started
to run away from the bazaar.

34:38.807 --> 34:42.167
-They can't earn much.
-The bread doesn't come from them.

34:42.927 --> 34:44.927
God is the one to provide the bread.

34:45.647 --> 34:50.247
If God closes one door,
he'll open another one.

34:50.447 --> 34:53.247
We just have to carry out
our responsibilities.

34:55.207 --> 34:56.407
Dündar Bey...

35:03.567 --> 35:05.167
Tekfur Ares sent a message.

35:06.007 --> 35:08.407
He wants to talk to you
if you're available.

35:09.447 --> 35:11.287
It's okay. He can come.

35:15.367 --> 35:16.527
I wonder what happened.

35:17.247 --> 35:18.367
We'll see, Artuk Bey.

35:19.207 --> 35:20.327
We'll see.

35:38.927 --> 35:40.567
Your wound is so deep.

35:43.007 --> 35:45.927
The enemies who did this to you
must be very strong.

35:53.887 --> 35:57.287
But you're stronger than them.

36:00.127 --> 36:03.447
That wound has started to heal
ever since you touched it, Marya.

36:05.487 --> 36:07.927
Those hands must belong to a saint.

36:08.927 --> 36:10.567
I'm getting shy.

36:12.927 --> 36:16.207
You saved me from being a slave
and took me into your paradise.

36:16.607 --> 36:19.207
You are the saint.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.407
Not yet.

36:23.927 --> 36:27.207
But I stomped out our biggest enemy...

36:28.647 --> 36:32.447
I'll be the great knight saint
who kicked the Turks...

36:33.807 --> 36:34.927
out of Anatolia.

36:37.647 --> 36:39.087
So he was a Turk.

36:40.527 --> 36:44.687
I'm curious about this strong enemy
who made you this furious.

36:45.407 --> 36:48.607
It must have been so painful
for him to die in your hands.

36:57.727 --> 37:00.447
I never look back
at the people I destroy, Marya.

37:01.127 --> 37:02.567
I never mention them.

37:03.407 --> 37:05.127
I care about the future.

37:06.087 --> 37:10.447
I'm dreaming of the great knight, Ares,
who kicked out the Turks from our lands.

37:11.607 --> 37:13.967
Now you're a part of that dream.

37:14.967 --> 37:16.367
Think about the future, Marya.

37:19.487 --> 37:20.727
Whatever you want.

37:24.087 --> 37:25.727
Now I have to go.

37:26.447 --> 37:29.727
But when I come back,
we'll both be closer to that dream.

37:51.167 --> 37:52.167
Come on!

37:52.847 --> 37:55.287
Come on! Walk, you fools, walk!

37:55.767 --> 37:57.687
You useless men!

37:58.047 --> 38:00.167
Hurry up! Quick!

38:13.247 --> 38:14.687
Your eyes are on the keys.

38:16.567 --> 38:19.207
Simko said you're a very smart man.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.287
He was right.

38:22.487 --> 38:26.167
I can tell from the way you fight
and your eyes.

38:47.327 --> 38:48.487
My name is Pito.

38:49.847 --> 38:51.087
I was a miserable thief.

38:52.287 --> 38:53.447
It's clean, sir!

38:57.167 --> 38:58.407
I'm a sinner.

38:59.407 --> 39:01.887
I thought God was punishing me,
but I met you.

39:02.927 --> 39:05.847
Come on, you hangdogs!
What are you waiting for?

39:05.927 --> 39:06.767
Don't stall!

39:10.607 --> 39:14.367
We're all trying to run away
from the slave trader, Turk.

39:15.567 --> 39:19.407
We've all seen that you are too brave
to accept being a slave.

39:20.047 --> 39:21.887
If you want to escape, you're not alone.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.287
We have all accepted the risk of death.

39:36.687 --> 39:41.447
If you were a thief,
show your skills once more.

39:42.607 --> 39:44.047
Take those keys.

39:45.327 --> 39:50.527
I'll take those keys
to save you and us from these chains.

39:53.927 --> 39:58.167
But we are entrusting our lives to you,
you should know that.

40:08.767 --> 40:10.207
Look at me, you thief!

40:10.567 --> 40:12.087
What did I tell you?

40:12.207 --> 40:14.167
I told you not to speak to that man.

40:22.727 --> 40:24.967
You haven't behaved yourself
ever since I bought you.

40:25.167 --> 40:26.127
Mavro!

40:26.647 --> 40:30.447
Take that man and whip him
the rest of the way so he'll behave!

40:36.607 --> 40:37.927
You low scumbag!

40:38.487 --> 40:39.367
Hah!

41:01.727 --> 41:05.127
Don't deprive me of the strength
to crush the cruel.

41:57.207 --> 41:59.127
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

41:59.607 --> 42:01.487
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

42:16.767 --> 42:18.847
I want my hunt on my dinner table.

42:19.367 --> 42:21.767
Serve it with almond rice and raisins.

42:21.927 --> 42:23.767
Yes, Majesty Emir.

42:34.247 --> 42:37.007
Majesty Emir, Bahadır Bey is here.

42:37.607 --> 42:39.167
He's going to the Cavdar Village.

42:39.367 --> 42:40.567
Good.

42:40.927 --> 42:44.127
Let him see Aslıhan Hatun for a while.

42:44.927 --> 42:46.527
Let him settle down in the pavilion.

42:47.287 --> 42:49.687
We've got a lot of important stuff to do.

42:50.007 --> 42:53.287
With Bahadır Bey's arrival,
the Anatolian people

42:53.527 --> 42:55.687
will change just as we want them to, sir.

42:55.887 --> 42:57.727
We call the shots now, Göktuğ.

42:58.807 --> 43:02.127
Dündar will ask for help eventually,
and he'll be at our mercy.

43:03.607 --> 43:06.487
Then we'll start digging the Kayıs graves.

43:08.247 --> 43:10.207
And Aslıhan will see...

43:10.567 --> 43:13.007
who is stronger.

43:32.167 --> 43:35.887
Aslıhan Hatun, praise be.
Your hair is just like silk.

43:36.807 --> 43:38.447
The brush flows by itself.

43:41.447 --> 43:43.047
Thank you, Esma Hatun.

43:48.687 --> 43:51.607
You and Turgut Alp look perfect together.

43:55.407 --> 43:58.127
When is your wedding?

44:06.487 --> 44:08.727
I just want him to come back
alive and well.

44:10.447 --> 44:16.127
We can have our wedding after that,
if God permits.

44:16.487 --> 44:19.487
May God let him come alive and well,
quickly.

44:20.647 --> 44:21.647
Amen.

44:29.487 --> 44:31.487
What's the drum for?

44:36.527 --> 44:38.247
Am I allowed to come in, Aslıhan Hatun?

44:38.447 --> 44:39.527
No, Kırca.

44:40.207 --> 44:41.167
Tell me.

44:41.727 --> 44:44.807
Bahadır Bey is approaching the village
with his son Sancar Bey.

44:50.967 --> 44:52.487
I hope he's got good intentions.

44:54.007 --> 44:55.367
I don't think so.

44:56.807 --> 45:00.047
Only evil spawns
where Bahadır comes from.

45:04.167 --> 45:06.007
May God turn this into a blessing.

45:22.847 --> 45:26.287
Our Bahadır Bey is coming.

45:43.127 --> 45:44.047
Welcome, Bey!

45:48.407 --> 45:50.607
The one who storms
through the battlefield.

45:51.327 --> 45:53.687
The one who makes the enemy spit blood.

45:54.487 --> 45:56.967
The one who cuts 40 hands
with a dark weapon.

45:57.447 --> 46:01.007
Bahadır Bey with a speedy horse
and the life of a lion.

46:02.727 --> 46:05.847
Welcome, Bahadır Bey. Welcome.

46:05.927 --> 46:08.007
You cheered up our village, Bey.

46:08.647 --> 46:10.327
Welcome, Bahadır Bey.

46:10.607 --> 46:12.447
You brought joy!

46:13.247 --> 46:17.487
You brought joy! You brought victory!
You brought honor to our village!

46:17.647 --> 46:20.167
Your victory overflows your majesty, Bey.
Welcome.

46:20.247 --> 46:22.527
First of all, the victory is God's.

46:23.327 --> 46:25.447
I hope we never go through a separation
again.

46:25.527 --> 46:28.327
God willing, my Bey.

46:48.607 --> 46:51.527
Fortunately, I was lucky enough

46:52.247 --> 46:57.687
to come back to my village years later,
and with a battle victory.

47:04.087 --> 47:09.807
I know you've been missing the honor
of a victory for years.

47:13.367 --> 47:18.607
I came here to share my victory
with the Cavdars

47:18.807 --> 47:21.367
and to earn new victories

47:22.767 --> 47:25.647
and to hang the enemy's heads
on the village entrance.

47:26.447 --> 47:30.287
So that every passerby

47:30.687 --> 47:35.207
can see Cavdars have gained
the honor of a battle.

47:35.767 --> 47:42.687
Your wish is our command, Bahadır Bey.
Your wish is our command, Bahadır Bey.

47:49.167 --> 47:54.567
Hand out the battle treasures
to all the Cavdars.

47:55.007 --> 48:02.007
Long live Bahadır Bey!
Long live Bahadır Bey!

48:08.847 --> 48:11.167
May your victory be blessed, Bey!

48:11.847 --> 48:13.767
Long live Bahadır Bey!

48:15.087 --> 48:17.087
May your victory be blessed, Bey!

48:17.247 --> 48:22.327
Long live Bahadır Bey!
May your victory be blessed, Bey!

48:23.727 --> 48:25.967
May your treasure be blessed, Bey!

48:26.727 --> 48:29.047
Long live Bahadır Bey!

48:30.447 --> 48:32.607
Long live Bahadır Bey!

48:40.207 --> 48:42.047
Welcome, Bahadır Bey.

48:42.887 --> 48:45.287
Thank you, Aslıhan Hatun.

48:54.327 --> 48:59.847
The purpose of our lives is to claim lives
on the battlefield and become glorious.

49:01.207 --> 49:03.247
I was swaddled in a lion's coat.

49:04.087 --> 49:06.087
I grew up destroying eagles' nests.

49:08.007 --> 49:10.327
Valor comes from the womb.

49:13.327 --> 49:16.327
You know Karaca Hatun.
She became my wife.

49:16.527 --> 49:17.567
May God make you happy.

49:18.807 --> 49:19.847
May God bless you.

49:23.167 --> 49:28.287
I heard that you are taking care

49:28.367 --> 49:30.927
of my late brother Candar Bey's legacy.

49:31.607 --> 49:32.887
That's right.

49:33.647 --> 49:36.807
Thank God, I take care of his legacy
perfectly.

49:44.807 --> 49:46.327
Come into my pavilion.

49:47.767 --> 49:50.287
You've been traveling. Rest a little.

49:51.607 --> 49:55.207
Kırca, ask the Hatuns
to bring some sherbet.

49:56.487 --> 49:58.727
Our guests have come a long way.

50:00.167 --> 50:01.607
They are tired.

50:05.567 --> 50:06.607
Please go ahead.

50:43.873 --> 50:46.433
What is the purpose
of your visit, Governor Ares?

50:48.193 --> 50:50.113
It's about the situation with the bazaar.

50:51.433 --> 50:53.793
You aren't able to protect it
from the bandits.

50:56.713 --> 50:58.673
Our alps are on guard everywhere here.

50:59.153 --> 51:01.233
With God's permission,

51:01.993 --> 51:04.833
the bandits will be destroyed
and the bazaar will be back to normal.

51:06.153 --> 51:09.273
I think we all know that is not possible,
Dündar Bey<i>.</i>

51:11.033 --> 51:13.593
Greek traders are also suffering losses
because of this situation.

51:14.193 --> 51:17.553
You know, I'm responsible for the safety
of them and their properties.

51:18.513 --> 51:21.033
What are you trying to imply, governor?

51:21.953 --> 51:24.073
If you can't ensure security and order

51:24.553 --> 51:25.833
then, maybe the best idea is

51:26.393 --> 51:28.953
to sell the bazaar to someone
who can ensure security.

51:30.513 --> 51:33.393
Or else I'll have to forbid Greek traders
from coming to the bazaar.

51:43.033 --> 51:44.233
Do you think it's that easy

51:45.793 --> 51:47.113
to sell the bazaar just like that,

51:47.513 --> 51:50.353
knowing that we paid a high price
in blood, Governor Ares?

51:50.433 --> 51:54.313
This inn and the bazaar are the relics
of our Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

51:54.993 --> 51:58.033
They were acquired with blood,
they can only be given with blood.

51:59.633 --> 52:02.553
Ertuğrul Bey promised
to ensure the safety of the people.

52:03.313 --> 52:05.633
You are not able to fulfill his promise.

52:06.113 --> 52:08.553
Soon, even the Muslims won't come here
to trade.

52:09.393 --> 52:12.913
You and the other traders
will suffer even greater losses.

52:13.513 --> 52:15.273
You can save the traders and yourselves

52:15.633 --> 52:18.593
from greater losses by selling the bazaar.

52:19.433 --> 52:21.873
If you find it acceptable
and want to sell it,

52:23.073 --> 52:24.993
I'd like to purchase the bazaar.

52:30.953 --> 52:33.673
The bazaar is not for sale.

52:39.353 --> 52:41.433
Thanks for your advice, Governor Ares.

52:43.753 --> 52:46.033
Then, I'll be waiting
to hear from you, Dündar Bey<i>.</i>

54:03.233 --> 54:05.713
Do you intend to punish
or to kill him, you bastard?

54:05.993 --> 54:07.713
I've had enough of you!

54:29.633 --> 54:30.913
What's going on?

54:33.793 --> 54:34.913
What's going on?

54:35.633 --> 54:38.193
He held my hand
while I was whipping that thief.

54:38.353 --> 54:40.593
He took the whip from my hand
and hit me with it.

54:41.273 --> 54:42.113
Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

54:43.753 --> 54:45.833
Didn't I tell you to behave?

54:46.433 --> 54:50.153
No vile man can tame brave men.

54:50.713 --> 54:52.513
For God's sake, I won't behave.

54:57.073 --> 54:58.793
It's understood.

54:59.313 --> 55:01.553
I'll punish you to teach you a lesson.

55:02.353 --> 55:04.953
Listen here, there's a deserted place
on our way.

55:05.273 --> 55:08.393
We'll rest and spend the night there.

55:08.473 --> 55:11.393
And I'll punish you there, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

55:33.353 --> 55:34.673
Lady Esma.

55:35.433 --> 55:37.073
Yes, Lady Aslıhan.

55:37.753 --> 55:40.673
Prepare our guests' tents.

55:41.313 --> 55:42.953
Be sure to make them feel at home.

55:53.553 --> 55:54.713
Lady Aslıhan.

55:56.393 --> 55:58.713
I'm not here as a guest.

56:02.193 --> 56:04.713
According to our traditions,
strangers can be guests.

56:05.353 --> 56:07.993
Not those who share the same blood.

56:09.113 --> 56:11.993
You're most welcome, Lady Karaca.

56:12.713 --> 56:16.313
My tribe and my tent are also yours.

56:17.393 --> 56:19.673
My niece Aslıhan...

56:20.513 --> 56:22.993
With the order of Vizier Sadettin,

56:23.193 --> 56:26.833
I came here to reunite the Çavdars.

56:29.793 --> 56:33.193
And our people will be here
in a couple of days, Lady Aslıhan.

56:40.033 --> 56:41.273
Welcome.

56:42.833 --> 56:44.553
You are very welcome.

56:46.273 --> 56:47.713
But know this.

56:48.273 --> 56:50.433
The Çavdars are already united.

56:51.033 --> 56:54.113
Our unity will last forever

56:54.473 --> 56:56.153
as long as I'm the leader of this tribe.

56:56.273 --> 56:58.153
Very well, my niece.

56:58.233 --> 56:59.833
Seeing you like this has made me happy.

56:59.913 --> 57:04.713
You did your task very well.

57:09.353 --> 57:10.553
But...

57:12.033 --> 57:16.953
now it's up to a man from the Çavdars
to be the leader.

57:42.273 --> 57:46.673
<i>My Halime, whenever you send me to fight</i>
<i>with tears in your eyes,</i>

57:47.313 --> 57:48.873
<i>I can't think straight.</i>

57:48.993 --> 57:50.553
<i>My sword becomes useless.</i>

57:52.913 --> 57:56.313
<i>I'm proud and I believe in you, Ertuğrul.</i>

57:56.873 --> 57:58.873
<i>Don't you know I love you?</i>

57:59.393 --> 58:00.433
<i>I miss you.</i>

58:00.633 --> 58:01.673
<i>I cry for you.</i>

58:02.113 --> 58:03.073
<i>I wait for you.</i>

58:03.553 --> 58:05.113
<i>Yet I stand patient.</i>

58:06.953 --> 58:09.313
<i>May my tears be your companion.</i>

58:10.033 --> 58:12.233
<i>May my love be your shield.</i>

58:30.913 --> 58:32.113
Dear God...

58:34.593 --> 58:36.673
This is too much to endure.

58:38.753 --> 58:40.913
I can't take this anymore.

58:41.673 --> 58:43.593
I can't take this any longer.

58:47.233 --> 58:49.673
God...

58:50.433 --> 58:52.753
I wish I was the one who died.

58:53.993 --> 58:57.193
So that I wouldn't have to suffer

58:58.033 --> 58:59.793
because I failed to save my bey<i>.</i>

59:01.913 --> 59:04.193
So that I wouldn't have to see a child

59:04.793 --> 59:06.273
suffering like that.

59:08.353 --> 59:10.153
I wish I was the one you took, God.

59:48.993 --> 59:50.913
Mother, Aktolgali is coming.

01:00:14.033 --> 01:00:15.273
Aktolgali.

01:00:19.433 --> 01:00:20.673
Welcome.

01:00:21.433 --> 01:00:22.633
My Gündüz.

01:00:27.793 --> 01:00:28.873
Come on, pet him.

01:00:31.473 --> 01:00:32.873
Aktolgali.

01:01:59.433 --> 01:02:02.393
If you were someone else,
I'd already have killed you.

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:05.153
You have cost me a lot, Ertuğrul.

01:02:06.513 --> 01:02:08.193
I have taken good care of you.

01:02:08.473 --> 01:02:11.593
We both have to be patient

01:02:11.673 --> 01:02:12.993
until I'm paid for my troubles.

01:02:14.553 --> 01:02:16.793
If it's the gold you are after

01:02:17.873 --> 01:02:20.313
then I can give you more than you want.

01:02:21.033 --> 01:02:23.153
I will give you more than you want

01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:26.153
if you let me and these slaves go.

01:02:27.833 --> 01:02:30.073
I'm touched
by your mercifulness, Ertuğrul.

01:02:31.113 --> 01:02:35.473
It gives me goosebumps
to see you still thinking

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:37.593
about the slaves.

01:02:39.913 --> 01:02:42.433
But even your wealth won't be enough

01:02:43.033 --> 01:02:45.433
to pay me how much I want.

01:02:46.233 --> 01:02:49.353
So the man who tricked me is very rich.

01:02:50.913 --> 01:02:51.953
You can't even imagine.

01:02:52.993 --> 01:02:54.313
Is he as rich as an emperor?

01:02:55.953 --> 01:02:57.833
As rich as a vizier?

01:02:59.913 --> 01:03:01.633
As rich as a governor?

01:03:07.753 --> 01:03:08.953
That's enough, Ertuğrul.

01:03:10.513 --> 01:03:13.113
You'll be in chains till morning.

01:03:16.553 --> 01:03:18.513
If you behave and ask for my forgiveness

01:03:18.913 --> 01:03:20.833
then maybe I'll reconsider
your punishment.

01:03:23.273 --> 01:03:25.833
Do you think you can tame me
by putting me in chains?

01:03:27.593 --> 01:03:29.513
What are you going to do? Huh?

01:03:30.553 --> 01:03:32.193
Will you rip this tree from its roots?

01:03:33.153 --> 01:03:35.713
We are the descendants
of those who melted iron mountains.

01:03:36.873 --> 01:03:38.793
Nothing can stop us.

01:03:42.433 --> 01:03:44.073
We will see, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:03:44.593 --> 01:03:45.713
We will see.

01:04:19.713 --> 01:04:20.953
Look, Mavro.

01:04:21.193 --> 01:04:24.073
This man is so bold,
he can wrestle with an elephant.

01:04:25.713 --> 01:04:26.953
He is insane, a maniac!

01:04:27.593 --> 01:04:29.833
He is chained to the tree
but keep your eyes on him,

01:04:29.993 --> 01:04:31.913
just in case.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:57.553
Aktolgali is coming, Aktolgali!

01:04:57.673 --> 01:04:59.433
The horse of our bey is coming.

01:04:59.593 --> 01:05:01.313
Aktolgali is coming!

01:05:07.473 --> 01:05:08.913
Aktolgali is here!

01:05:12.593 --> 01:05:14.473
Aktolgali is here!

01:05:29.513 --> 01:05:30.833
Aktolgali.

01:05:32.953 --> 01:05:34.233
My God.

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:41.713
Grandmother! Aktolgali is back!

01:06:03.073 --> 01:06:04.393
Aktolgali.

01:06:06.753 --> 01:06:08.433
Companion of my son.

01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:15.633
Our blessed prophet says
that horses bring good news

01:06:16.713 --> 01:06:18.993
along with their saddles.

01:06:20.953 --> 01:06:25.513
I hope you bring good news
to our troubled tribe.

01:06:26.473 --> 01:06:27.593
Hopefully, Mother.

01:06:30.313 --> 01:06:32.073
He is a beacon of hope for us.

01:06:32.913 --> 01:06:35.193
Horses are the companions of the warriors.

01:06:36.233 --> 01:06:38.193
As per our traditions

01:06:38.633 --> 01:06:41.353
let's cut his beautiful tail

01:06:42.633 --> 01:06:44.953
and tie it to his companion's tombstone.

01:06:46.073 --> 01:06:47.233
Yes, Mother.

01:06:49.153 --> 01:06:50.233
We shall do that.

01:06:52.433 --> 01:06:54.073
My Aktolgali.

01:07:29.953 --> 01:07:31.193
Blessed vizier.

01:07:31.593 --> 01:07:33.553
Dündar Bey wants to see you.

01:07:37.273 --> 01:07:39.273
I wasn't expecting him so soon.

01:07:40.433 --> 01:07:42.553
So, Ares stung him deep.

01:07:44.073 --> 01:07:45.313
Let him come.

01:08:11.073 --> 01:08:14.033
-Welcome Dündar Bey.
-Thank you, blessed vizier.

01:08:14.113 --> 01:08:15.233
Come on, take a seat.

01:08:21.153 --> 01:08:23.713
What's up? What is troubling you?

01:08:24.513 --> 01:08:26.473
Is there a problem with the tribe?

01:08:28.873 --> 01:08:30.673
We've been having a hard time

01:08:31.033 --> 01:08:32.593
since my brother's death.

01:08:33.233 --> 01:08:35.073
It's getting worse every day.

01:08:36.633 --> 01:08:37.833
And the bazaar...

01:08:39.353 --> 01:08:42.313
The situation with the bazaar
also troubles me.

01:08:43.273 --> 01:08:46.233
Even the traders don't visit there
anymore, let alone the customers.

01:08:46.713 --> 01:08:49.113
You know, our Sultan believes

01:08:49.433 --> 01:08:51.193
that trading is vital.

01:08:53.153 --> 01:08:54.073
I know.

01:08:54.593 --> 01:08:55.713
I know, blessed vizier.

01:08:56.673 --> 01:08:58.873
Our business is getting worse and worse.

01:08:59.913 --> 01:09:01.833
Governor Ares came to the bazaar today.

01:09:02.873 --> 01:09:03.913
Interesting.

01:09:04.633 --> 01:09:05.713
What did he want?

01:09:08.753 --> 01:09:10.233
He said this couldn't go on.

01:09:10.473 --> 01:09:12.633
He said someone capable should
buy the bazaar.

01:09:13.553 --> 01:09:15.193
And he himself proposed to buy it.

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:19.793
I wanted to discuss it with you first.

01:09:20.153 --> 01:09:22.393
Well, well, well.
So he wants to buy the bazaar?

01:09:24.473 --> 01:09:27.993
So, what do you think about it?

01:09:29.233 --> 01:09:31.673
I need to discuss it with my tribe, first.

01:09:32.073 --> 01:09:34.313
I'm not sure they'd be okay
with selling the bazaar to Ares.

01:09:34.913 --> 01:09:38.473
Yet there is no reason
to insist on suffering losses.

01:09:39.233 --> 01:09:42.033
I intend to sell the bazaar,
one way or another.

01:09:42.993 --> 01:09:44.233
Well thought.

01:09:45.073 --> 01:09:47.313
You need to sell it
if it causes you to suffer losses.

01:09:47.593 --> 01:09:48.873
A leader is someone

01:09:49.273 --> 01:09:53.593
who can make hard decisions
in times of need.

01:09:53.993 --> 01:09:55.273
Don't worry.

01:09:56.033 --> 01:09:57.553
I'll be with you.

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:03.953
Now go and discuss the topic
with your mother and your tribe.

01:10:04.873 --> 01:10:06.633
And I'll also think about it.

01:10:08.633 --> 01:10:10.313
As you order, blessed vizier.

01:11:33.313 --> 01:11:35.993
Dear God, who watches over his people.

01:11:38.673 --> 01:11:42.033
Dear God, who helps those in need.

01:11:44.873 --> 01:11:48.673
Dear God, who makes the sun shine
after a long period of darkness.

01:11:51.153 --> 01:11:52.793
Please relieve me of this pain

01:11:54.473 --> 01:11:58.633
which makes my heart burn in flames.

01:12:01.753 --> 01:12:03.913
Please ease my sufferings.

01:12:05.833 --> 01:12:08.873
Take this unbearable burden away from me.

01:12:11.233 --> 01:12:12.353
Give me strength

01:12:13.273 --> 01:12:16.513
so that I can watch over my tribe
and my children.

01:12:18.913 --> 01:12:19.913
Amen.

01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:07.793
Dear God,

01:13:09.473 --> 01:13:10.593
you are the one

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:13.793
who protected his prophet in dark caves

01:13:14.433 --> 01:13:16.753
with a spiderweb.

01:13:18.593 --> 01:13:20.433
You are omnipotent.

01:13:21.713 --> 01:13:22.833
Help this subject of yours

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:25.593
to escape from these chains.

01:13:26.993 --> 01:13:28.473
Strengthen my hands.

01:13:29.593 --> 01:13:31.713
Empower my spirit with your grace.

01:13:35.153 --> 01:13:36.833
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:13:38.553 --> 01:13:39.593
Oh, God!

01:14:51.113 --> 01:14:52.433
You took responsibility

01:14:53.233 --> 01:14:55.153
for the tribe
after my nephews and brother

01:14:56.193 --> 01:14:59.513
passed away.

01:15:02.753 --> 01:15:03.873
That's right.

01:15:04.873 --> 01:15:06.993
I took good care of my tribe.

01:15:07.793 --> 01:15:08.793
Thank God.

01:15:09.313 --> 01:15:10.433
Very well.

01:15:11.153 --> 01:15:14.913
But you can't continue to do so
as a woman.

01:15:16.193 --> 01:15:18.033
There will be some changes
in the border lands.

01:15:18.793 --> 01:15:21.473
Çavdars will have to make
great contributions.

01:15:22.193 --> 01:15:23.153
Now,

01:15:23.713 --> 01:15:26.473
it's inevitable
that we choose a male leader.

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:32.793
There is no such need now.

01:15:33.633 --> 01:15:36.153
I'll take good care of my tribe

01:15:36.313 --> 01:15:38.393
just like I've been doing

01:15:38.753 --> 01:15:40.353
up to this point.

01:15:41.073 --> 01:15:42.353
For sure.

01:15:44.353 --> 01:15:45.393
You as a woman

01:15:46.353 --> 01:15:49.753
did all you could for the tribe.

01:15:50.633 --> 01:15:54.073
But all these years
of recession is enough.

01:15:55.433 --> 01:15:57.953
A male Çavdar should take the lead.

01:15:58.993 --> 01:16:02.793
So that our tribe outgrows the tents!

01:16:05.113 --> 01:16:08.513
So that our alps build
castles made of heads

01:16:08.913 --> 01:16:12.513
and swim in pools of gold.

01:16:15.193 --> 01:16:17.993
So that we can take the lion's share

01:16:18.633 --> 01:16:19.953
of the loots from the heathens.

01:16:23.193 --> 01:16:24.273
Bahadir Bey.

01:16:25.073 --> 01:16:26.793
Lady Aslıhan knows our traditions
very well.

01:16:27.593 --> 01:16:29.353
She will do the right thing for sure.

01:16:31.593 --> 01:16:34.073
It's not that easy, Bahadir Bey!

01:16:34.873 --> 01:16:36.153
You should know that!

01:16:41.833 --> 01:16:45.673
It's not appropriate for a lady
to be in a position of leadership

01:16:46.473 --> 01:16:49.713
while there is a glorious bey
like Bahadir Bey<i>.</i>

01:16:50.113 --> 01:16:51.353
Sancar!

01:17:04.593 --> 01:17:05.513
Now,

01:17:07.593 --> 01:17:09.873
I'll discuss the matter
with the other beys.

01:17:10.873 --> 01:17:14.073
I'll ask for a council meeting at once.

01:17:14.873 --> 01:17:16.193
And you should do your part...

01:17:17.193 --> 01:17:20.473
instead of resisting against the flow.

01:19:07.953 --> 01:19:11.993
Why are you smirking, filthy thief?

01:19:12.673 --> 01:19:14.153
Look at you.

01:19:15.193 --> 01:19:18.913
The strong Turk even took your sleep
away from you.

01:19:26.313 --> 01:19:29.113
So, you still want some more whipping!

01:19:30.073 --> 01:19:31.113
Yes, I do.

01:19:32.473 --> 01:19:35.633
Seeing the Turk taking the whip
out of your hands was quite a scene.

01:19:45.073 --> 01:19:46.433
You can't do anything to me.

01:19:49.113 --> 01:19:50.913
Simko would make you pay for it.

01:19:51.313 --> 01:19:54.313
And do you know how much gold I'm worth?

01:19:55.593 --> 01:19:59.353
Don't worry.
Simko's only concern is the Turk.

01:19:59.513 --> 01:20:03.833
He wouldn't care about the death
of a filthy thief like you.

01:20:19.873 --> 01:20:23.393
I'll bury you all in the darkness,

01:20:23.473 --> 01:20:26.073
for all the innocent people you killed.

01:20:47.633 --> 01:20:50.433
Unchain the slaves, too.
We'll leave here at once, Pito.

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:19.513
Be quiet.

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:40.073
What is it, son?

01:21:40.473 --> 01:21:42.073
Is there a problem?

01:21:43.313 --> 01:21:44.433
Yes, Mother.

01:21:45.753 --> 01:21:47.433
You all know about the bazaar.

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:49.553
It has gradually become

01:21:51.313 --> 01:21:52.833
a deserted place.

01:21:55.153 --> 01:21:56.953
It's obvious
that it can't go on like this.

01:22:01.153 --> 01:22:03.513
We need to find a way out

01:22:03.913 --> 01:22:05.913
before it gets even worse.

01:22:09.313 --> 01:22:11.113
We know, son.

01:22:13.353 --> 01:22:15.833
There are black clouds upon us.

01:22:18.473 --> 01:22:19.753
What do you think?

01:22:29.793 --> 01:22:31.473
I say we sell the bazaar, Mother.

01:22:45.313 --> 01:22:47.833
This is not a way out, Dündar Bey<i>.</i>

01:22:48.793 --> 01:22:53.633
The bazaar is more precious to us
than any treasure in the world.

01:22:54.473 --> 01:22:55.553
You know that very well.

01:22:57.153 --> 01:22:58.393
I do, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

01:22:58.753 --> 01:22:59.673
I do.

01:23:00.433 --> 01:23:03.153
Yet it becomes a burden
if it doesn't make a profit.

01:23:05.633 --> 01:23:09.233
It'll be even harder for us to go on
if we lose our reputation.

01:23:10.913 --> 01:23:13.073
If we want a way out

01:23:13.913 --> 01:23:17.753
then we should consider fixing the problem
instead of selling the bazaar.

01:23:21.953 --> 01:23:24.593
The bazaar is a relic of Ertuğrul Bey.

01:23:27.753 --> 01:23:31.153
There is no need
to make him feel disturbed in his grave.

01:23:34.673 --> 01:23:37.553
This is a place of discussions.

01:23:38.073 --> 01:23:40.193
And there is an important matter
to discuss.

01:23:40.633 --> 01:23:42.833
Everyone wants what's best for the tribe.

01:23:43.353 --> 01:23:47.153
It's appropriate for everyone
to speak their minds.

01:23:48.713 --> 01:23:51.673
Ertuğrul Bey took the bazaar
with his sword, Mother.

01:23:52.433 --> 01:23:54.873
How can we even discuss selling it?

01:23:57.553 --> 01:23:59.073
The appropriate thing to do is

01:23:59.633 --> 01:24:01.633
to sharpen your words like a sword

01:24:02.073 --> 01:24:04.033
and say no to them.

01:24:04.113 --> 01:24:05.113
My girl.

01:24:06.033 --> 01:24:09.353
We are in a critical situation.

01:24:10.793 --> 01:24:12.513
Sharp words

01:24:13.393 --> 01:24:15.393
won't do any good

01:24:15.873 --> 01:24:17.553
in a matter like this.

01:24:29.633 --> 01:24:30.673
Lady Hayme.

01:24:31.393 --> 01:24:32.593
You are right.

01:24:32.993 --> 01:24:34.433
The issue is very important.

01:24:34.793 --> 01:24:37.233
However, selling the bazaar
is not the solution.

01:24:38.313 --> 01:24:41.353
Also, the one who offered it...

01:24:45.473 --> 01:24:46.753
was Governor Ares.

01:24:55.033 --> 01:24:56.793
What is this, Dündar Bey<i>?</i>

01:24:58.033 --> 01:25:01.993
Do you intend to sell the bazaar,
which was taken with a fight,

01:25:02.193 --> 01:25:04.393
to the heathens in return for gold?

01:25:09.473 --> 01:25:12.313
Mother, don't you have anything
to say to that?

01:25:37.593 --> 01:25:40.593
<i>-The slaves are escaping!</i>
<i>-Get up!</i>

01:25:40.673 --> 01:25:43.153
<i>Get up, the slaves are escaping! Run!</i>

01:25:43.273 --> 01:25:45.873
Damn it! Get them!

01:25:46.353 --> 01:25:48.873
Pito! You run away!
I will catch up with you! Go!

01:25:48.953 --> 01:25:50.353
May God protect you, Turk.

01:26:00.713 --> 01:26:01.913
Is that so, Dündar?

01:26:04.153 --> 01:26:05.153
Yes, Mother.

01:26:07.793 --> 01:26:09.353
But I didn't say yes to the governor.

01:26:15.073 --> 01:26:17.793
The bazaar can't be sold to a heathen

01:26:18.833 --> 01:26:20.873
even if it does need to be sold.

01:26:21.553 --> 01:26:24.473
A heathen can't buy

01:26:25.793 --> 01:26:27.953
the Muslims' blood with gold.

01:26:28.553 --> 01:26:30.433
This is our red line.

01:26:30.913 --> 01:26:32.793
I'm not suggesting selling it
to the governor!

01:26:37.873 --> 01:26:40.553
I'd like this matter to be discussed
without any bad intentions.

01:26:40.633 --> 01:26:43.353
The matter started
with a bad intention, Dündar Bey<i>.</i>

01:26:44.073 --> 01:26:46.273
No matter who the buyer is

01:26:46.633 --> 01:26:49.913
this bazaar can't be sold for gold,

01:26:50.553 --> 01:26:52.033
as it wasn't acquired with gold.

01:26:54.833 --> 01:26:56.553
Artuk Bey is right.

01:26:58.433 --> 01:26:59.713
Whatever I do,

01:27:00.353 --> 01:27:03.873
I do for the good of my tribe, Artuk Bey!

01:27:05.273 --> 01:27:07.233
We can't even prevent the bandits
from attacking.

01:27:08.353 --> 01:27:11.753
The bazaar needs to be sold
before it becomes a greater burden!

01:27:13.553 --> 01:27:15.993
It will cause losses
as long as we have it.

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:20.193
It's no time for conflict.

01:27:20.913 --> 01:27:22.113
What we need to do is

01:27:22.713 --> 01:27:24.873
to stand united and find a solution

01:27:25.393 --> 01:27:28.873
instead of arguing.

01:27:34.433 --> 01:27:36.593
Dündar Bey has found

01:27:37.393 --> 01:27:39.353
his own solution.

01:27:41.473 --> 01:27:44.273
And you spoke your minds.

01:27:45.473 --> 01:27:48.353
The bazaar is not personal property.

01:27:48.913 --> 01:27:50.993
It belongs to the tribe.

01:27:51.753 --> 01:27:56.313
Discussing the matter with the council
is the appropriate thing to do.

01:27:56.753 --> 01:27:59.593
Dündar Bey should gather the council

01:28:00.393 --> 01:28:01.913
as soon as possible.

01:28:02.993 --> 01:28:06.953
And we should abide by the decision
of the council.

01:28:17.233 --> 01:28:19.793
No! I need him alive!

01:28:43.913 --> 01:28:45.193
Get him! Run!

01:28:46.153 --> 01:28:47.713
-Run!
-Catch them all!

01:29:02.233 --> 01:29:05.793
You should've seen Dündar's face.

01:29:08.713 --> 01:29:09.633
I saw it.

01:29:10.673 --> 01:29:12.393
He came to me after you spoke to him.

01:29:13.953 --> 01:29:15.633
He mentioned your offer.

01:29:16.953 --> 01:29:18.553
They won't sell the bazaar to you.

01:29:19.273 --> 01:29:23.313
But Dündar still intends to sell it.

01:29:23.993 --> 01:29:26.313
He was going to discuss it with his tribe.

01:29:27.633 --> 01:29:29.633
Everything is going smoothly,
Vizier Sadettin.

01:29:30.353 --> 01:29:32.033
You have the advantage, now.

01:29:34.033 --> 01:29:36.713
Bahadir Bey<i>,</i>
a bey of the Çavdars, arrived today.

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:40.593
He is the uncle of Aslıhan.

01:29:42.913 --> 01:29:45.713
He will make this place
home for his tribe.

01:29:46.393 --> 01:29:47.473
Also,

01:29:48.113 --> 01:29:52.593
he will buy the bazaar for us.

01:29:54.473 --> 01:29:57.113
I envy your wit, Vizier Sadettin.

01:29:58.993 --> 01:30:00.073
So...

01:30:00.873 --> 01:30:04.153
Now, it's your turn, Ares.

01:30:35.233 --> 01:30:38.153
Here is the shiny glow of our victory,
Vizier Sadettin.

01:31:05.473 --> 01:31:07.353
That bazaar is ours now.

01:31:08.353 --> 01:31:10.993
No one can stop us,

01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:14.113
neither Ertuğrul, nor the Kayi tribe.

01:31:14.713 --> 01:31:17.073
I have no doubt about it,
Vizier Sadettin.

01:31:18.153 --> 01:31:21.633
No one can stop us
as long as we stand together.

01:31:30.713 --> 01:31:32.113
Not even the Sultan.

01:31:32.793 --> 01:31:33.953
Not even the emperor.

01:31:36.353 --> 01:31:37.873
Not even the emperor.

01:31:59.073 --> 01:32:00.673
Come on!

01:32:05.673 --> 01:32:07.033
Thank God!

01:32:11.913 --> 01:32:14.033
I will reunite with my family!

01:32:14.793 --> 01:32:16.833
After all, I'll get to see my children!

01:32:23.473 --> 01:32:25.713
We are grateful for everything.

01:32:25.793 --> 01:32:28.513
We wouldn't have been able to escape
from them if it weren't for you.

01:32:29.713 --> 01:32:33.073
It's not over yet. We may come across them
at any moment.

01:32:33.353 --> 01:32:37.033
There is no need to worry now.
Simko will never be able to catch us.

01:32:37.233 --> 01:32:41.193
That pack of bastards is unpredictable.
Come on, be quick.

01:32:41.713 --> 01:32:44.153
Come on!

01:33:02.793 --> 01:33:04.873
We were very fortunate today, again.

01:33:04.953 --> 01:33:08.393
We raided yet another caravan
going to the bazaar.

01:33:09.073 --> 01:33:11.873
-Thanks to our friend Ares.
-Mihalis!

01:33:12.193 --> 01:33:15.473
-Is there another caravan?
-It's something far more precious.

01:33:16.073 --> 01:33:18.353
-What is it?
-I saw Ertuğrul, the bey of the Kayi.

01:33:18.433 --> 01:33:20.833
Are you delusional, you fool?
Ertuğrul is dead!

01:33:21.393 --> 01:33:24.913
No, Mihalis, he is not.
I'm sure I saw him.

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:21.353
Come on!

01:34:29.873 --> 01:34:34.193
The star of richness is shining upon us.
We'll get the real prize now.

01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:53.593
Simko the slave trader. So, you have
Ertuğrul in your possession.

01:34:54.473 --> 01:34:57.753
Send word to Ares.
Let him know we saw Ertuğrul,

01:34:57.913 --> 01:35:01.753
that Simko the slave trader had him
and that we were chasing after them.

01:35:01.873 --> 01:35:03.393
All right, Mihalis.

01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:53.753
Oh, Aktolgali!

01:35:59.233 --> 01:36:03.113
Somehow, I can't accept the death
of Ertuğrul Bey.

01:36:04.593 --> 01:36:10.633
And you arrived at such a time
that you became a beacon of hope for me.

01:36:12.313 --> 01:36:17.073
Perhaps they will call me crazy
and they will mock me.

01:36:17.353 --> 01:36:21.753
But I don't care what they say.

01:36:23.233 --> 01:36:28.193
You are back, along with a beacon of hope.

01:36:30.113 --> 01:36:36.633
No one can extinguish this hope
inside my heart now.

01:36:38.473 --> 01:36:39.873
My God,

01:36:41.753 --> 01:36:45.033
you placed this hope in my heart.

01:36:46.553 --> 01:36:50.833
You wouldn't do that if there wasn't
something planned.

01:36:54.633 --> 01:36:59.153
Either set this hope ablaze
or extinguish it once and for all.

01:37:01.193 --> 01:37:03.913
I can't take it anymore.

01:37:23.873 --> 01:37:25.553
Come on!

01:38:02.633 --> 01:38:06.353
They went this way. They can't be too far.

01:38:06.433 --> 01:38:08.113
Quickly! Come on.

01:38:37.833 --> 01:38:39.833
I need to speak with the blessed vizier.

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:50.033
Your Eminence, Bahadir Bey is asking
for permission to talk to you.

01:38:50.393 --> 01:38:51.793
Let him come.

01:39:09.513 --> 01:39:10.433
Your Eminence.

01:39:12.273 --> 01:39:16.353
Bahadir Bey, victorious commander
of the battlefields.

01:39:22.553 --> 01:39:25.193
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

01:39:25.273 --> 01:39:26.513
Go on, take a seat.

01:39:29.393 --> 01:39:31.113
We've heard of your bravery.

01:39:32.233 --> 01:39:34.353
You left a trail of dead enemies
in your wake, again.

01:39:35.233 --> 01:39:39.633
Praise be, no enemy who fell into my claws
was able to escape.

01:39:40.273 --> 01:39:42.153
Excellent.

01:39:43.473 --> 01:39:46.513
You deserve a reward after all this glory.

01:39:47.313 --> 01:39:52.553
From now on, you'll settle in these lands
with your tribe.

01:39:53.473 --> 01:39:59.113
With your arrival, the divided Cavdars
will be reunited and made stronger.

01:39:59.473 --> 01:40:01.833
Hopefully so, Your Eminence.

01:40:02.433 --> 01:40:06.033
May God protect you and the state.

01:40:07.633 --> 01:40:09.593
Did you talk to Lady Aslıhan?

01:40:10.793 --> 01:40:13.393
I did. I said I wanted a council meeting.

01:40:15.433 --> 01:40:17.673
She didn't like the idea.

01:40:18.753 --> 01:40:22.193
But the Cavdar beys are what is important.

01:40:22.633 --> 01:40:27.873
I'll talk to them one by one
and convince them about the meeting.

01:40:28.273 --> 01:40:32.673
Be quick about it.
We have important things to do with you.

01:40:34.113 --> 01:40:35.833
I'm very curious. What is it?

01:40:36.633 --> 01:40:41.153
The bey of the Kayi, Dündar,
wants to sell the bazaar.

01:40:42.113 --> 01:40:44.753
And you'll make a proposal to buy it,

01:40:47.233 --> 01:40:50.833
which will increase your reputation.

01:40:52.073 --> 01:40:54.153
Excuse me, Your Eminence.

01:40:54.833 --> 01:41:00.033
But even if I wanted to buy the bazaar,
I couldn't possibly afford it.

01:41:00.353 --> 01:41:04.193
Don't worry. I've gotten everything
ready for you.

01:41:30.073 --> 01:41:31.513
This is yours.

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:36.033
You'll make your proposal
with these golds.

01:41:36.713 --> 01:41:38.993
I'll talk to Dündar for you.

01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:43.273
And he won't be able to refuse
when he sees this gold.

01:41:44.473 --> 01:41:46.073
But I have some conditions.

01:41:53.153 --> 01:41:54.753
You need only to command, Your Eminence.

01:41:58.193 --> 01:42:03.953
You'll reunite the Cavdars
and become their leader.

01:42:04.753 --> 01:42:08.953
Then, you'll do whatever it takes
to become the margrave.

01:42:12.193 --> 01:42:14.953
Now, we are in this together.

01:42:15.513 --> 01:42:19.273
So, you won't take a step
without my knowledge.

01:42:21.633 --> 01:42:23.793
Furthermore, whatever it takes,

01:42:24.313 --> 01:42:28.593
you'll prevent the marriage
of Turgut and Lady Aslıhan.

01:42:29.473 --> 01:42:32.513
That marriage won't take place.

01:42:33.873 --> 01:42:35.393
You understand, don't you?

01:42:36.473 --> 01:42:38.513
I do, Your Eminence.

01:42:40.273 --> 01:42:41.393
Excellent.

01:42:43.073 --> 01:42:48.473
So, go back and do whatever is necessary
to gather the council.

01:42:50.393 --> 01:42:51.913
And wait to hear from me.

01:43:40.513 --> 01:43:42.473
Get ready, Goktug.

01:43:43.113 --> 01:43:45.193
We are going to the bazaar.

01:43:46.073 --> 01:43:47.713
As you order, Your Eminence.

01:44:00.273 --> 01:44:01.113
Move!

01:44:08.753 --> 01:44:09.873
What is that?

01:44:12.553 --> 01:44:14.513
It's addressed to Commander Ares.

01:44:18.993 --> 01:44:21.673
These are the Turkish tribes
which surround us.

01:44:22.633 --> 01:44:27.513
The grand operation will start
once the army comes from Nicaea,

01:44:27.633 --> 01:44:30.793
and we'll destroy them all.

01:44:34.073 --> 01:44:38.073
You dealt a debilitating blow to the Turks
by destroying Ertuğrul.

01:44:38.633 --> 01:44:42.593
We'll burn their tribes,
herds and bazaars.

01:44:43.513 --> 01:44:45.873
We won't stop until we rip
their hearts out.

01:44:46.553 --> 01:44:48.473
We will hit them so hard

01:44:48.873 --> 01:44:51.273
that there will never be another Ertuğrul.

01:44:52.553 --> 01:44:53.833
Come in!

01:44:55.993 --> 01:44:57.153
What is it?

01:44:59.313 --> 01:45:00.593
Governor Ares,

01:45:00.873 --> 01:45:04.553
I found this letter nailed on the door
of your chamber with a dagger.

01:45:09.433 --> 01:45:11.753
<i>We have Ertuğrul, he is alive.</i>

01:45:12.033 --> 01:45:16.633
<i>We healed his wounds and we know</i>
<i>that you killed his </i>alps<i>.</i>

01:45:17.393 --> 01:45:21.753
<i>I didn't reveal your identity to Ertuğrul.</i>
<i>If you don't do what I demand</i>

01:45:21.833 --> 01:45:25.513
<i>he and the sultan will find out</i>
<i>it's you who ambushed him.</i>

01:45:25.593 --> 01:45:27.113
<i>Wait to hear from me.</i>

01:45:35.913 --> 01:45:39.873
How is it possible
that Ertuğrul is alive? He is dead!

01:45:39.993 --> 01:45:41.433
Sir, calm down.

01:45:42.033 --> 01:45:45.273
You saw his burial with your own eyes.

01:45:45.353 --> 01:45:46.873
Then who wrote this letter?

01:45:48.713 --> 01:45:53.193
Who infiltrated us and nailed this letter
on the door of my chamber with a dagger?

01:45:53.393 --> 01:45:56.073
Sir, whoever they are, they are lying.

01:45:56.713 --> 01:45:58.793
No one would dare do that.

01:45:59.633 --> 01:46:05.233
Ertuğrul is alive. He lives.
Find whoever did this at once.

01:46:06.113 --> 01:46:08.833
Find him right now, I said.
Get the hell out of here!

01:46:15.153 --> 01:46:16.073
I murdered him.

01:46:16.153 --> 01:46:18.113
I murdered Ertuğrul!

01:46:19.593 --> 01:46:21.033
Ertuğrul!

01:46:38.193 --> 01:46:39.673
Water!

01:46:40.713 --> 01:46:43.553
We are so tired. Let us rest.

01:46:44.033 --> 01:46:45.353
I can't go on like this.

01:46:46.033 --> 01:46:51.393
We can't stop here. It's too dangerous.
Come on, just a little more.

01:46:51.593 --> 01:46:53.393
We'll die of fatigue.

01:47:33.513 --> 01:47:34.873
Come on.

01:47:35.673 --> 01:47:37.913
Come on.

01:47:39.513 --> 01:47:41.593
Come on.

01:48:04.953 --> 01:48:06.913
-Take it easy.
-Thanks.

01:48:21.713 --> 01:48:23.073
Where are you headed?

01:48:24.713 --> 01:48:26.113
To the Red Apple.

01:48:37.753 --> 01:48:40.993
-What is your destination?
-Martyrdom.

01:48:51.753 --> 01:48:53.513
Where will you end up?

01:48:54.073 --> 01:48:55.553
With the homeland.

01:49:01.713 --> 01:49:02.993
Where is the homeland?

01:49:06.033 --> 01:49:07.553
It's the whole world.

01:49:33.913 --> 01:49:36.313
Ilbey wanted me to deliver this letter
to you.

01:49:40.593 --> 01:49:42.033
May God help you.

01:49:52.593 --> 01:49:55.913
<i>Artuk Bey, we heard about Ertuğrul Bey.</i>

01:49:55.993 --> 01:50:00.553
<i>We've revealed important information.</i>
<i>We are shadowing those lands.</i>

01:50:00.633 --> 01:50:04.993
<i>Take care of the Kayi tribe.</i>
<i>Don't let it disintegrate.</i>

01:50:05.073 --> 01:50:08.753
<i>I'll visit there as soon as possible.</i>
<i>Wait to hear from me.</i>

01:50:15.873 --> 01:50:18.633
<i>Ilbey wouldn't visit here</i>
<i>if it wasn't important.</i>

01:50:19.313 --> 01:50:22.673
<i>Dear God, both good and bad</i>
<i>are your doing.</i>

01:50:23.113 --> 01:50:25.553
<i>Please do good this time.</i>

01:50:48.233 --> 01:50:51.033
So, Dündar,

01:50:51.313 --> 01:50:54.473
did you find the chance to discuss
the issue about the bazaar?

01:50:55.033 --> 01:50:58.313
-Yes, Your Eminence.
-Very well.

01:50:58.473 --> 01:51:00.753
They don't want it to be sold to Ares.

01:51:02.273 --> 01:51:03.313
And they are right.

01:51:03.913 --> 01:51:08.153
But we decided to gather the council
to discuss the topic.

01:51:09.073 --> 01:51:14.713
Of course, the property of Muslims
can't be sold to the heathens.

01:51:15.793 --> 01:51:18.233
But there will be other buyers.

01:51:19.033 --> 01:51:22.393
I mean, if you are determined
to be the bey...

01:51:23.713 --> 01:51:24.673
I am.

01:51:25.993 --> 01:51:30.393
But I'm thinking what we'd do here
if we sold the bazaar.

01:51:38.433 --> 01:51:39.353
Dündar,

01:51:41.633 --> 01:51:43.753
is it absolutely necessary
for you to stay here?

01:51:45.113 --> 01:51:48.633
Why don't you go be with your brothers
Sungur Tekin and Gündoğdu?

01:51:53.153 --> 01:51:58.153
Look, you were with your brother Ertuğrul.

01:51:59.193 --> 01:52:01.193
But now you are all alone.

01:52:02.913 --> 01:52:05.473
It may be hard for you
in these border lands.

01:52:07.313 --> 01:52:12.073
You can revive your tribe with the gold
you'll receive for the selling.

01:52:13.113 --> 01:52:15.913
Then, you can migrate
to where your brothers are...

01:52:16.633 --> 01:52:20.793
and restore the power
of the Kayi tribe again.

01:52:22.873 --> 01:52:27.953
Additionally, I know someone who can pay
the amount of gold you want.

01:52:29.273 --> 01:52:30.273
Who is it?

01:52:30.753 --> 01:52:36.233
Bahadir Bey, the brother of Candar Bey.
He has just come back from battle.

01:52:36.353 --> 01:52:40.033
I know his plunder was substantial.
You can sell it to him if you like.

01:52:40.553 --> 01:52:43.353
Also, he is a Muslim, so it's appropriate.

01:52:45.393 --> 01:52:51.273
Accept his gold and relieve yourself
and your tribe from this misery.

01:52:52.593 --> 01:52:59.273
Also, migrate to where your brothers are
and restore the power of Kayi.

01:53:01.913 --> 01:53:03.793
You are right, Your Eminence.

01:53:05.793 --> 01:53:09.393
But first, the beys need to be convinced
at council.

01:53:09.833 --> 01:53:13.913
Well, you will show your skills.
Convincing is your duty.

01:53:18.433 --> 01:53:19.513
Dündar,

01:53:20.753 --> 01:53:25.033
you are not Dündar the Rookie anymore.
You are Dündar the Bey.

01:53:55.353 --> 01:53:57.873
Sir. Mihalis sent a letter.

01:53:57.953 --> 01:54:00.113
Didn't I tell him to hide somewhere?

01:54:00.473 --> 01:54:04.233
He was hiding, sir.
But there is some terrible news.

01:54:05.113 --> 01:54:06.033
Mihalis...

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:08.393
Mihalis saw Ertuğrul, sir.

01:54:10.633 --> 01:54:12.073
Is that fool sure he saw him?

01:54:12.713 --> 01:54:15.993
Not only Mihalis, sir.
His men also saw Ertuğrul.

01:54:16.793 --> 01:54:20.033
-I killed him!
-Mihalis is after him, sir.

01:54:20.113 --> 01:54:22.833
-Where did he see him?
-Simko the slave trader had him.

01:54:26.113 --> 01:54:28.633
Get him to me dead or alive at once.

01:54:29.113 --> 01:54:30.713
I said at once. Get lost!

01:54:32.753 --> 01:54:33.953
Door!

01:54:39.553 --> 01:54:42.513
So, Simko has him.

01:54:48.913 --> 01:54:49.993
Maria.

01:54:53.473 --> 01:54:56.233
That scum! Maria!

01:54:58.753 --> 01:54:59.833
Door!

01:55:15.593 --> 01:55:20.073
With the 99 names of the holy God,
who makes it happen

01:55:20.473 --> 01:55:25.233
when he says "Let there be,"
<i>bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

01:55:28.753 --> 01:55:32.473
Honorable and brave beys of the Kayi,

01:55:32.873 --> 01:55:35.513
you all know about the situation
the bazaar is in.

01:55:36.913 --> 01:55:40.953
Neither caravans nor traders
are visiting anymore.

01:55:41.233 --> 01:55:44.593
-Dündar Bey is right.
-The situation is bad.

01:55:44.753 --> 01:55:46.313
There will be a shortage of food soon.

01:55:46.433 --> 01:55:48.553
-Yes, soon.
-Yes, soon.

01:55:49.793 --> 01:55:53.233
It's impossible to deal with the bandits
who hit the caravans.

01:55:54.153 --> 01:55:58.553
And it's obvious this can't go on.
So, that's why...

01:55:59.913 --> 01:56:01.553
I decided to sell the bazaar.

01:56:04.233 --> 01:56:06.193
What will we do if we sell the bazaar?

01:56:06.313 --> 01:56:09.513
How can you sell the bazaar, my bey?
The bazaar is our source of income.

01:56:09.593 --> 01:56:12.833
-We don't have any other source.
-But Dündar Bey is also right.

01:56:12.913 --> 01:56:15.153
-What, should we suffer a food shortage?
-Beys.

01:56:15.233 --> 01:56:18.473
-What will we do if we sell the bazaar?
-My beys!

01:56:18.833 --> 01:56:19.673
My beys.

01:56:20.393 --> 01:56:22.353
As you know, this bazaar

01:56:22.433 --> 01:56:26.833
was acquired with the blood of martyrs.
So, think accordingly.

01:56:27.073 --> 01:56:31.713
Artuk Bey is right. He is.

01:56:31.953 --> 01:56:36.233
Selling the bazaar means turning our backs
on the legacy of Ertuğrul Bey.

01:56:37.353 --> 01:56:39.593
It means turning back on his cause.

01:56:43.593 --> 01:56:45.073
Whatever I do,

01:56:46.233 --> 01:56:47.913
I do for the good of the tribe.

01:56:48.713 --> 01:56:51.313
My brother would do the same.

01:56:57.993 --> 01:57:01.233
Watch what you are saying.

01:57:02.993 --> 01:57:05.513
These words are not appropriate...

01:57:07.393 --> 01:57:10.073
in a council meeting opened with prayers.

01:57:16.233 --> 01:57:18.793
With the gold we'll get
in return for selling the bazaar,

01:57:19.673 --> 01:57:22.593
our tribe will revive itself
and be relieved of the shortages.

01:57:22.673 --> 01:57:25.393
Hopefully so.

01:57:25.473 --> 01:57:29.593
We listened to everyone. But your thoughts
are important, Mother Hayme.

01:57:29.753 --> 01:57:31.433
What do you think?

01:57:38.113 --> 01:57:43.593
It's true that the bazaar is the legacy
of my son and the martyrs,

01:57:44.393 --> 01:57:46.673
yet it's also true it has become a burden.

01:57:51.233 --> 01:57:56.793
They conquered the bazaar
for the sake of our tribe.

01:57:58.193 --> 01:57:59.313
Now,

01:58:01.633 --> 01:58:03.753
for the sake of our tribe,

01:58:04.793 --> 01:58:08.873
it can be sold if it needs to be.

01:58:15.833 --> 01:58:17.593
It is the beys' decision.

01:58:18.873 --> 01:58:20.993
How come? It's a tough decision.

01:58:21.073 --> 01:58:25.633
There will be nothing left once the bazaar
is sold. What will we do here then?

01:58:25.713 --> 01:58:27.393
We don't have to stay here.

01:58:30.353 --> 01:58:34.313
Where will we go, my bey?
This is our homeland.

01:58:34.433 --> 01:58:38.033
Where can we go?

01:58:42.193 --> 01:58:46.313
It's time for the Kayi

01:58:46.473 --> 01:58:50.393
to reunite and become one again.

01:58:51.633 --> 01:58:53.833
He is right.

01:58:57.273 --> 01:58:59.393
Having sold the bazaar,

01:59:00.353 --> 01:59:05.233
I say it's appropriate for us to migrate
where my brothers live.

01:59:05.473 --> 01:59:08.513
It's not appropriate.
How can we leave our lands?

01:59:10.633 --> 01:59:13.073
We can't leave these lands.

01:59:26.433 --> 01:59:27.913
Come on. Just a little more.

01:59:28.473 --> 01:59:29.633
Come on.

01:59:43.833 --> 01:59:46.873
Did you think you could escape
from me, Ertuğrul Bey, huh?

01:59:47.233 --> 01:59:52.073
You are my most precious slave.
I don't want to hurt you.

01:59:52.193 --> 01:59:53.633
So, surrender.

01:59:53.913 --> 01:59:58.033
I won't become a captive
to you or anyone else.

01:59:58.753 --> 01:59:59.593
Get him.

01:59:59.673 --> 02:00:02.513
-Run! Leave here!
-We can't leave you.

02:00:04.593 --> 02:00:07.753
Don't you hurt the Turk. I need him alive.

02:00:23.513 --> 02:00:26.033
My beys!

02:00:28.073 --> 02:00:34.073
The issue has become
about the cause of Ertuğrul <i>Bey.</i>

02:00:35.953 --> 02:00:41.793
Selling the bazaar and leaving the land
for which we shed our blood

02:00:42.073 --> 02:00:46.153
means turning our backs on the cause
of Ertuğrul Bey.

02:00:46.313 --> 02:00:49.713
-He is right.
-We can't give up on the cause.

02:00:49.833 --> 02:00:52.433
Artuk Bey is right.

02:00:53.353 --> 02:00:56.793
If that's the case, another council
meeting is necessary.

02:01:18.833 --> 02:01:20.313
For what, Artuk Bey?

02:01:22.793 --> 02:01:24.953
For the election of a new bey, Lady Hayme.

02:01:29.913 --> 02:01:35.473
We chose Dündar Bey as the leader
so that he could follow the cause,

02:01:35.913 --> 02:01:38.953
but he intends to turn his back
on the cause.

02:01:39.313 --> 02:01:43.353
Given the circumstances,
his leadership is not legitimate.

02:01:54.873 --> 02:01:59.113
What do you say, Artuk Bey?
Are you defying your bey's decision?

02:01:59.273 --> 02:02:02.513
Dündar Bey, you are the defiant one.

02:02:02.593 --> 02:02:06.993
You are not defiant against a single man
but against a whole cause.

02:02:12.353 --> 02:02:16.393
-He is right. Yes.
-He speaks the truth.

02:02:27.433 --> 02:02:30.353
Let's say we gathered the council.

02:02:36.793 --> 02:02:40.833
Is there anyone asking to be the leader
other than Dündar Bey?

02:02:47.513 --> 02:02:49.033
There is, Lady Hayme.

02:02:49.153 --> 02:02:52.753
To follow the path and the cause
of Ertuğrul Bey,

02:02:53.273 --> 02:02:54.793
I'm a candidate.

02:02:54.873 --> 02:02:57.593
-Artuk Bey, what are you saying?
-How?

02:03:52.033 --> 02:03:52.953
Who the hell are they?

02:04:23.193 --> 02:04:24.753
Don't let Ertuğrul get away.
