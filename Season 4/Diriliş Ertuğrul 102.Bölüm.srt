00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
episode 102 start after 12:43 min.

2
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:40,611
Betrayal, ever worse than the enemy,

3
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:45,691
you have no place in these lands.

4
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,291
Get the bodies away from the fire.

5
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:15,131
-Quick, put the fire out.
-Come on, everyone.

6
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:37,371
Yagiz Alp.

7
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:39,971
-Find Bahadir.
-As you wish, sir.

8
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:51,891
Samsa...

9
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:54,131
Samsa.

10
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:00,171
One of our martyrs is here.

11
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:12,531
-Brother.
-Samsa.

12
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:15,971
Samsa...

13
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,371
Samsa, my brave brother.

14
00:16:27,731 --> 00:16:28,731
Samsa.

15
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,811
How could they do this to you, brother?

16
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:34,491
How could those scum do this?

17
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,691
Unless we take your revenge,

18
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:42,611
there will be no peace...

19
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:45,731
for you nor for us in this land, Samsa.

20
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:54,891
I promise we will.

21
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:57,931
I promise.

22
00:17:01,531 --> 00:17:02,371
Bastards.

23
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:06,051
They slaughtered them all, sir.

24
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,211
We have all the bodies, sir.

25
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,531
Prepare to get them back to camp.

26
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:28,811
Find Bahadir.

27
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:30,971
Bahadir Bey isn't here, sir.

28
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:34,331
We couldn't find his body.

29
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,771
What do you mean, "You couldn't," Yagiz?

30
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,011
Did you check the bodies?

31
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:48,571
Yes, sir. He wasn't there.

32
00:17:58,971 --> 00:17:59,971
Bamsi Alp.

33
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,691
We know who was stationed here.

34
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,131
Identify all the bodies at once.

35
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,691
See if it's just Bahadir missing.

36
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:14,131
Let me know.

37
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,931
Yes, sir.

38
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,131
Hurry up.

39
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:03,131
<i>I need to find another way</i>

40
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,651
<i>to get out of here and see Ertuğrul Bey.</i>

41
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,491
Sir.

42
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:26,371
All our soldiers stationed here are dead.

43
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:27,851
Only Bahadir is missing.

44
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:31,131
Do you think those heathens
took him captive?

45
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:34,851
Those bastards killed all my men.

46
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:37,411
Why would they take him prisoner, Bamsi?

47
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:40,931
Those that are trying to deter us

48
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,131
could have killed Bahadir easily.

49
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:47,611
Bahadir is neither dead

50
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:49,691
nor captive.

51
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,851
Looking at all our dead comrades,

52
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:56,611
and burned catapults,

53
00:21:57,811 --> 00:21:59,211
I believe he got away.

54
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:01,611
Traitor scum!

55
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:04,891
And he boasts how well he fights.

56
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,811
Did he run away from battle like a coward?

57
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:09,371
We will find out...

58
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:13,491
if he ran due to fear or due
to betrayal, Bamsi.

59
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:18,331
Turgut.

60
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:19,851
Head to the camp.

61
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:22,171
Bahadir is probably there.

62
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,891
Bring him to me fast.

63
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,331
When all these men were killed,

64
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:31,651
he'll tell me how he could
run back to the camp.

65
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,451
This might be a plot...

66
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:36,291
by Bahadir and Ares.

67
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:38,331
Be careful.

68
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:40,731
As you wish, sir.

69
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:42,811
Go on.

70
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:49,611
Let us take our dead back to the camp.

71
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:53,411
People might lose hope...

72
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:56,171
once they see that the catapults...

73
00:22:56,931 --> 00:22:58,571
were burned to a crisp.

74
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:01,851
I shall be there,

75
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:04,051
so that people don't lose hope...

76
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:06,331
and that they may be tenacious.

77
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:09,051
They need to know that the war...

78
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,891
has just begun. We haven't lost.

79
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:14,091
As you wish, sir.

80
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:17,491
Yagiz Alp.

81
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,331
Send news to all the beys.

82
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:21,371
They shall stay put.

83
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:23,731
Günküt, Dumrul, Abdur Rahman.

84
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:28,411
They shall find people to look after
their units and come back to the camp.

85
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:29,851
As you wish, sir.

86
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:34,651
Sir, we could have conquered
the fortress

87
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:35,891
with the catapults.

88
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:37,971
Our soldiers were stationed
accordingly, too.

89
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:39,531
It's all burned down.

90
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,011
What do we do now?

91
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:44,331
We will keep the order, Bamsi.

92
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:47,131
We will give it our all

93
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:49,011
and make new catapults.

94
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:54,531
Yes, sir.

95
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:58,891
And they shall see that this
won't deter us.

96
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:19,571
Be careful, everyone.

97
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:52,811
Titan succeeded again, sir.

98
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:55,131
The catapults were burned down.

99
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:57,171
Ertuğrul's men are dead as well.

100
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:04,171
Titan is an army by himself, Kostas.

101
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:06,731
He has proven it once again.

102
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:10,451
With this loss,
Ertuğrul should be crippled.

103
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:13,771
I made him lose face in the eyes
of the Turkmen tribes.

104
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:17,091
Now, I'll make him suffer defeat
again and again.

105
00:25:17,531 --> 00:25:19,131
I'll not let him breathe.

106
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,491
<i>Divide et Impera.</i>

107
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:23,411
Divide and conquer.

108
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:27,371
Ertuğrul must be mad with anger.

109
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:30,051
And he will attack the walls in fury.

110
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,211
If he makes such a stupid mistake,

111
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:34,131
it'll mean the end for him.

112
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:36,451
Don't be so sure, Kostas.

113
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:41,651
Ertuğrul isn't so stupid as to
charge at the walls out of anger.

114
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:45,851
He'll grieve for his dead men
and try to find a way out.

115
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:49,411
That's exactly when I'm going to
deal the killing blow to him.

116
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:51,811
How so, sir?

117
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:56,291
Bahadir Bey.

118
00:25:57,131 --> 00:25:59,091
He should have attacked
his tribe by now.

119
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:01,931
It's time to make use of him.

120
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:04,251
What are you going to do?

121
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:07,851
I'll use Bahadir to lure Ertuğrul
into a trap, Kostas.

122
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:12,011
Find me a brave soldier.
He'll go to Cavdar tribe.

123
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:16,091
Have him take my letter to Bahadir Bey
through the secret path.

124
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:51,251
Bahadir Bey, who united and gave
strength to the Cavdars.

125
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,971
Congratulations and all the best.

126
00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:07,851
Congratulations, Bahadir Bey.

127
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,411
<i>Bismillahirahmanirahim.</i>

128
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:37,811
I, Bahadir Bey, son of Kara Cavli,

129
00:27:39,211 --> 00:27:40,211
swear on the Quran,

130
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,491
our flag, and my sword.

131
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:45,891
If I ever sway from our faith,
our traditions,

132
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:49,171
and my brother Candar's path,

133
00:27:49,931 --> 00:27:53,171
I shall perish by my razor-sharp sword

134
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:55,491
in honor of the Quran and our flag.

135
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:58,491
I shall unite the Cavdars...

136
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:02,211
and resurrect and advance our tribe.

137
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:07,571
I swear never to stray from my brother
Candar Bey's path.

138
00:28:22,811 --> 00:28:24,451
Bring Aslıhan Hatun here.

139
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:40,331
Let me go!

140
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:55,931
Pledge your allegiance to Bahadir Bey,

141
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,411
Aslıhan Hatun.

142
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:03,211
I'd rather die a thousand deaths

143
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:05,131
than obey him.

144
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:12,651
You're all cowards.

145
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:17,971
You have betrayed the margrave
while we are at war.

146
00:29:18,771 --> 00:29:22,411
You murdered my beys and my soldiers.

147
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:24,731
You'll regret it.

148
00:29:27,331 --> 00:29:29,731
I'm giving you one last chance, Aslıhan.

149
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:32,331
Don't waste it.

150
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,651
Otherwise, your husband Turgut

151
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:39,171
will die because of your obstinacy.

152
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:44,531
Obey me,

153
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:47,691
and I shall let both of you live.

154
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:53,651
You and your beys at this
blood-stained marquee

155
00:29:54,171 --> 00:29:56,891
have no more chances, Bahadir Bey.

156
00:29:57,731 --> 00:30:01,851
You'll pay with your blood
for forming this assembly

157
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:04,731
on the blood of my soldiers,

158
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:06,971
and pretending to be a bey.

159
00:30:09,811 --> 00:30:14,411
Ertuğrul Bey will make you pay
for what you have done, sooner or later.

160
00:30:14,491 --> 00:30:15,491
Quiet!

161
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:17,811
Quiet, you impudent wench!

162
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:20,651
You still dare to hide behind Ertuğrul Bey

163
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:22,931
and preach to me?

164
00:30:25,251 --> 00:30:29,091
Isn't it Ertuğrul that caused the death...

165
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:32,291
of your very own father,

166
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:33,971
and deceived your brother Ural?

167
00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:41,691
And here you are, shamelessly wishing
to keep chasing behind Ertuğrul.

168
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:46,851
You will die before you even get
a chance...

169
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:50,211
to beg for forgiveness in this marquee

170
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:51,811
that you have covered with our blood.

171
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:54,331
Enough is enough! Know your place!

172
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:56,491
Are you looking for trouble?

173
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:05,771
Then,

174
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,491
you and Turgut Alp...

175
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:12,611
may very well dig your own graves.

176
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:15,611
Burn in hell!

177
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,731
Sir.

178
00:31:21,891 --> 00:31:22,891
Sir.

179
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:28,211
Ertuğrul Bey's men were attacked
before the siege.

180
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:31,651
All the catapults burned down,
and all his men were killed.

181
00:31:49,651 --> 00:31:50,651
Fool.

182
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:54,011
Fool.

183
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:57,491
He lost the war before it even began.

184
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:00,011
He won't find the strength...

185
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:03,051
to fight, let alone conquer the fortress.

186
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:10,171
So, he couldn't protect the catapults
that I labored to make.

187
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:12,531
He let his men...

188
00:32:13,771 --> 00:32:15,011
be wiped out...

189
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:16,531
in a treacherous ambush.

190
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,091
And he's supposed to be margrave.

191
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:25,851
I'll make you bow before me, Ertuğrul.

192
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:31,931
There, Aslıhan.

193
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:35,291
This is your Ertuğrul,

194
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:40,251
who you trusted and to whom
you gifted our tribe.

195
00:32:42,091 --> 00:32:44,571
Ertuğrul, who let his men get ambushed,

196
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:48,491
and who once let himself be taken captive,

197
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:53,931
has become the food of Ares' soldiers.

198
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:59,011
God surely has a reason for this...

199
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,331
ill fate.

200
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:04,531
As you don't know the will of God,

201
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:07,891
you still have yet to see
Ertuğrul Bey's wrath.

202
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:10,451
You'll get what you deserve.

203
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:43,891
Bey.

204
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:46,571
What happened?

205
00:33:47,371 --> 00:33:49,171
They attacked the catapult camp, Halime.

206
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:52,571
They were already dead when we arrived.

207
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:55,891
They burned the catapults, too.

208
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:57,731
Oh, my God.

209
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,331
Cruel bastards!

210
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:08,651
My boys.

211
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:11,491
My brave boys.

212
00:34:13,091 --> 00:34:15,131
God bless you.

213
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:19,931
My son.

214
00:34:30,411 --> 00:34:32,011
Devoted mothers and brave men...

215
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:34,531
of the Kayi.

216
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:37,411
I know well...

217
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:41,171
that it tears your heart out
to see your sons...

218
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:43,131
and husbands die.

219
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:47,891
But they fought and died for God.

220
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:53,171
God says thus:

221
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:57,531
"Don't call those who died for me dead."

222
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,171
"As they are alive."

223
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:03,411
"But you can't comprehend it."

224
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:09,691
The souls of our men
will give us moral support.

225
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:12,491
Each drop of their blood

226
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,771
will help us flourish in these lands.

227
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:18,051
Our enemies want to stop us in our tracks

228
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:20,651
with ambushes and traps.

229
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:22,531
However,

230
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:24,651
we'll flow like a wild river

231
00:35:24,971 --> 00:35:27,731
and flood them all.

232
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:32,411
Don't let this deter you.

233
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,651
As long as it's for our country

234
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:37,171
and our rippling flag,

235
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:39,611
we are all ready to fight in this war.

236
00:35:41,531 --> 00:35:44,811
I already lost a son for God's cause.

237
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:49,411
I'm ready to give the other three, sir.

238
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,691
Thank you.

239
00:35:57,171 --> 00:36:00,011
-God bless you all.
-Amen.

240
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:01,451
Amen.

241
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:09,531
Artuk Bey, come with me.

242
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:57,171
Who are these guards?

243
00:36:58,171 --> 00:37:00,251
They are not our soldiers.

244
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:04,211
I wonder what happened.

245
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:07,531
Something is amiss.

246
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:32,651
Turgut.

247
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:39,731
Sancar.

248
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:49,331
What are you doing here?

249
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:53,451
We came with my father to take back
our tribe that you took violently.

250
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:56,051
Now neither your chief...

251
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:59,691
nor Aslıhan Hatun has any power here.

252
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,331
Where is Aslıhan Hatun?

253
00:38:08,811 --> 00:38:09,931
We put her where she belongs.

254
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:12,611
Get him.

255
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:32,131
Take her away.

256
00:38:49,971 --> 00:38:50,971
Turgut.

257
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:53,571
Aslıhan.

258
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:00,811
Bastards!

259
00:39:10,971 --> 00:39:11,971
Sir.

260
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:15,491
How did Ares's soldiers manage
to get close to the catapults?

261
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:17,811
How could no one notice them?

262
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:20,531
We'll find out, Artuk Bey.

263
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:25,731
Once the men I stationed before the walls
come, I'll ask them.

264
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,491
Then we'll find out how they came.

265
00:39:28,651 --> 00:39:31,011
Could it be Bahadir's doing, sir?

266
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,091
I sent Turgut Alp.

267
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,571
He'll bring him to me for sure.

268
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:38,011
If it's Bahadir's doing,

269
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:41,491
he'll suffer my wrath this time,
Artuk Bey.

270
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:53,051
Artuk Bey.

271
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,291
Yes, sir.

272
00:39:55,611 --> 00:39:57,851
We organized our men for using catapults.

273
00:39:59,011 --> 00:40:01,851
We need new catapults to keep the order.

274
00:40:02,451 --> 00:40:04,011
Gather the men at the camp.

275
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:06,371
As you wish, sir.

276
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:08,811
But what are we going to do?

277
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:10,731
Who knows how to make them?

278
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:13,411
I do, Artuk Bey.

279
00:40:15,491 --> 00:40:17,771
As you wish, sir. Excuse me now.

280
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:19,251
Thank you.

281
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:34,811
Surrender, Turgut.

282
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:37,611
Tell your men to drop their weapons.

283
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,771
Or Aslıhan Hatun dies with you.

284
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:48,531
My father doesn't want to kill you.

285
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:50,211
He wants to deal with your bey.

286
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:53,731
He wants to put an end to this hostility.

287
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,051
He doesn't want to shed more blood.

288
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:07,731
Surrender, so that this ends here.

289
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,811
Stop the bloodshed between our tribes.

290
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:15,931
Surrender.

291
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:19,171
Lowly bastards.

292
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:41,091
You have no power in this tribe.

293
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:44,051
You will obey.

294
00:41:45,491 --> 00:41:48,331
We obey only God.

295
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:53,971
And we destroy those

296
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:56,491
who would stray from God.

297
00:42:20,491 --> 00:42:22,251
Take these two to the captives' tent.

298
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:34,371
-Are you okay, Aslıhan?
-Turgut.

299
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:36,171
I'm okay, don't worry about me.

300
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:40,251
They took advantage of the situation
since our men were under siege.

301
00:42:40,611 --> 00:42:44,611
Bahadir sent his own men beforehand
with Sancar.

302
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:47,011
They invaded the camp.

303
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:49,451
Lowly bastards.

304
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:52,491
Turgut, this is our fate.

305
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:54,851
We must endure until our last breath.

306
00:42:55,451 --> 00:42:58,811
-These dogs can't stop us, Aslıhan.
-Stop talking and walk.

307
00:42:59,171 --> 00:43:00,171
Walk.

308
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:25,669
I had these catapults done myself.

309
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:29,509
They can...

310
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:34,189
throw rocks weighing ten <i>kantar</i>.

311
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:28,509
I brought these for you to examine.

312
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:30,589
I'll level the castle to the ground.

313
00:45:31,949 --> 00:45:34,509
Even if you set a thousand traps for me,

314
00:45:35,629 --> 00:45:37,669
you will not avoid your end.

315
00:45:41,749 --> 00:45:44,629
I've seen our people's resiliency
and strength.

316
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:49,069
I am convinced that those cruel people
cannot break us, Mother.

317
00:45:50,149 --> 00:45:53,109
Our people are so devoted, so generous.

318
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,709
Thank God.

319
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:57,189
You are right, my dear.

320
00:45:58,709 --> 00:46:01,149
They suffer
because of the deaths of their loved ones.

321
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:03,749
But they showed resilience.

322
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:05,709
Now our job is

323
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:07,629
to be with them,

324
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:10,389
and try to

325
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:13,629
ease their suffering.

326
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:23,189
Halime, my dear.

327
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:28,389
We should set up
a tent for our sisters to mourn.

328
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:31,109
We should be with them

329
00:46:31,709 --> 00:46:33,109
to increase their resiliency,

330
00:46:33,389 --> 00:46:34,749
and strength.

331
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:36,509
Okay, Mother.

332
00:46:37,389 --> 00:46:38,469
Hafsa, my dear.

333
00:46:39,189 --> 00:46:42,149
You should help the women of our tribe
with the funerals.

334
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:44,029
Be with them.

335
00:46:45,149 --> 00:46:46,429
Take supplies to them

336
00:46:46,749 --> 00:46:48,269
for their funeral dinner.

337
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:50,389
Yes, Mother Hayme.

338
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:52,829
What should I do, Grandmother?

339
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:58,909
Come with us to the mourning tent.

340
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,949
The martyrs had children.

341
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:04,109
They are your siblings now.

342
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:06,229
Brotherhood and friendship

343
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:07,989
are important at times like these.

344
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:10,789
You should be with them now,

345
00:47:11,669 --> 00:47:14,309
and they will never forget this
for their entire lifetime.

346
00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:17,069
-Okay, young man?
-Okay, Grandmother.

347
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:21,909
Let's go, then.

348
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:25,909
We should go set up the mourning tent.

349
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:29,549
And we will have someone read the Quran
for our martyrs.

350
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:32,029
-Let's go.
-In the name of God.

351
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:35,749
Alçiçek, you should stay with Savcı.

352
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:37,349
Yes, Halime Sultan.

353
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:39,949
Come with me.

354
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:31,069
Get out.

355
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:41,109
You still look rebellious.

356
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:46,589
My patience is wearing thin,

357
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:47,869
I am warning you.

358
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:51,069
Obey me,

359
00:48:52,149 --> 00:48:53,949
and I will spare your lives.

360
00:48:56,949 --> 00:48:59,309
You are wasting your breath, Bahadir Bey.

361
00:49:00,149 --> 00:49:02,789
We won't obey you, even if we die.

362
00:49:11,229 --> 00:49:12,229
Then...

363
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:18,429
you will sign your own death warrants,
Aslıhan Hatun.

364
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:23,029
Do you think

365
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:25,989
that Ertuğrul Bey
will not take our revenge?

366
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:29,669
Do you think that
the Sultan won't make you pay for this,

367
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,189
when he learns what you did?

368
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:36,509
You are the one
who signs his own death warrant.

369
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:43,869
I have never...

370
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:49,109
revolted against

371
00:49:49,749 --> 00:49:52,869
my state or my margrave.

372
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:58,189
Ertuğrul Bey said, "We're going to war."
and I said "Okay."

373
00:49:59,509 --> 00:50:02,109
I said I will put my alps under his order.

374
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:05,709
I made those catapults myself.

375
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:07,389
And then what?

376
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:08,909
Huh?

377
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:09,989
Then what?

378
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:14,829
Ertuğrul Bey

379
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:20,909
couldn't protect the catapults
and his alps from Ares's soldiers.

380
00:50:22,949 --> 00:50:23,949
And I took

381
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:26,389
the seigniory that I deserve

382
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,309
the right way.

383
00:50:29,629 --> 00:50:31,549
You are lying!

384
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:34,909
Where were you when our alps were dying?

385
00:50:35,229 --> 00:50:36,229
Where were you?

386
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:38,309
My duty

387
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,709
was making the catapults.

388
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:43,029
Ensuring security

389
00:50:43,509 --> 00:50:45,229
was Ertuğrul Bey's duty.

390
00:50:46,149 --> 00:50:48,509
I did my duty perfectly.

391
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:50,389
But,

392
00:50:50,749 --> 00:50:51,789
Ertuğrul Bey...

393
00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:54,869
couldn't ensure the security.

394
00:50:56,629 --> 00:50:58,669
You are full of lies.

395
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,069
You took advantage of our alps absence
when they were at war,

396
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:03,709
and invaded my tribe.

397
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,149
Enough.

398
00:51:11,149 --> 00:51:14,189
Enough with your nonsense.

399
00:51:16,469 --> 00:51:17,469
How long

400
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,469
were you going to
try to prevent my leadership?

401
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:25,029
I was going to take
what I deserve one day.

402
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:27,589
And it is today.

403
00:51:31,909 --> 00:51:34,429
Ertuğrul Bey will bring you to account.

404
00:51:37,149 --> 00:51:38,149
Turgut.

405
00:51:40,469 --> 00:51:42,269
If I had bad intentions,

406
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:45,229
wouldn't I kill both of you?

407
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:49,309
Ertuğrul Bey

408
00:51:50,389 --> 00:51:52,669
will accept my leadership.

409
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:54,829
Otherwise,

410
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:57,629
you will all die.

411
00:52:20,189 --> 00:52:22,349
He wants to use us as leverage

412
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:24,629
to convince Ertuğrul Bey.

413
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:28,509
We need to find a way out of here.

414
00:52:46,629 --> 00:52:47,629
Aslıhan.

415
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:48,749
Come near me.

416
00:53:15,229 --> 00:53:16,789
<i>May I come in, Bey?</i>

417
00:53:18,469 --> 00:53:19,469
Come in, Artuk Bey.

418
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:33,629
Bey,

419
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:35,349
is that a catapult?

420
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:38,549
Yes, it is, Bamsi.

421
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:39,709
Magnificent.

422
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:41,109
Look at these drawings.

423
00:53:41,269 --> 00:53:43,309
Bey drew how to make one.

424
00:53:44,149 --> 00:53:46,429
It looks like a monster.

425
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:50,469
Bey,

426
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:53,669
they look better
than the ones Bahadir Bey drew.

427
00:53:55,429 --> 00:53:58,709
Our catapults will not only throw stones.

428
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:01,749
They will also throw oil barrels,

429
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:03,869
and we will burn our enemies.

430
00:54:05,229 --> 00:54:07,549
Since they are not handing over
the castle to me,

431
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,149
I will burn it to the ground.

432
00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:12,789
They deserved it a long time ago, Bey.

433
00:54:13,389 --> 00:54:16,229
We will start making
these catapults without delay.

434
00:54:17,309 --> 00:54:18,309
Time is pressing,

435
00:54:18,629 --> 00:54:19,909
and it's a difficult job.

436
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:21,469
However,

437
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:26,509
we have the power to overcome
every obstacle, with God's help.

438
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:28,469
They will see

439
00:54:28,909 --> 00:54:30,589
that their traps and dirty tricks

440
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:33,469
cannot dissuade us from our holy victory.

441
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:35,829
May God

442
00:54:36,029 --> 00:54:37,389
help us all.

443
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:38,989
Amen!

444
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,109
Amen.

445
00:54:42,389 --> 00:54:44,709
You will deal with this personally,
Artuk Bey.

446
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:48,229
I drew everything in detail.

447
00:54:49,029 --> 00:54:50,309
You should start right away.

448
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:52,029
As you wish, Bey.

449
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:56,789
Bey, they will not escape from us.

450
00:54:57,189 --> 00:54:59,749
Bey, we will use these catapults

451
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:00,949
against the heathen.

452
00:55:01,309 --> 00:55:04,189
And if you allow me
I would like to throw the first one.

453
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:06,909
I want to be the first one who burns them.

454
00:55:07,749 --> 00:55:08,749
You will, Bamsi.

455
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:10,469
You will, God willing.

456
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:12,629
We are looking forward to it.

457
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:15,549
Come on, then.

458
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:17,829
Go and do your duty.

Titan the Hero.

489
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:39,669
With your victory,

490
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:43,469
you have honored our castle,
our land and our empire.

491
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:46,149
Welcome, Titan the Hero.

492
00:58:52,269 --> 00:58:53,509
Welcome, my friend Titan.

493
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:58,669
Ertuğrul took the first blow
in this arena of war.

494
00:58:59,509 --> 00:59:01,829
Now it is time to throw him to the lions.

495
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:06,949
I am going to play a trick on him,
and Ertuğrul will be finished.

496
00:59:09,549 --> 00:59:10,749
What's on your mind, Ares?

497
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:13,149
I sent a letter to Bahadir.

498
00:59:14,269 --> 00:59:17,029
He will lure Ertuğrul
into a trap that you will set.

499
00:59:45,989 --> 00:59:46,989
Soldiers, out.

500
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:08,869
Tekfur Ares

501
01:00:09,709 --> 01:00:10,869
has sent a letter.

502
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:13,429
Let's see what he says.

503
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:32,829
What does sneaky Ares say?

504
01:00:34,469 --> 01:00:35,469
He said

505
01:00:35,789 --> 01:00:38,629
he will save me
from the trouble of Ertuğrul.

506
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:40,829
How?

507
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:43,349
He wants me to invite Ertuğrul

508
01:00:44,189 --> 01:00:47,069
to my tent to talk to him
as the Cavdar Bey,

509
01:00:47,389 --> 01:00:49,029
and obey him.

510
01:00:49,429 --> 01:00:50,549
What does that mean?

511
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,269
Why does that heathen meddle
in your business?

512
01:00:54,229 --> 01:00:55,789
That means, son...

513
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:57,789
Ertuğrul

514
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,709
will come here to reach an agreement,

515
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:03,309
and to save...

516
01:01:04,949 --> 01:01:06,389
Aslıhan and Turgut's lives,

517
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:07,909
one way or another.

518
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:10,829
Ertuğrul cannot afford a conflict

519
01:01:11,229 --> 01:01:12,669
in a time of war,

520
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:14,789
he wouldn't want to shed more blood.

521
01:01:16,709 --> 01:01:17,709
And then what?

522
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:20,189
But...

523
01:01:21,389 --> 01:01:24,189
Ertuğrul will never arrive here.

524
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:26,349
They will

525
01:01:26,909 --> 01:01:28,509
set a trap on the road

526
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:30,669
and kill Ertuğrul.

527
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:40,909
Ertuğrul will never forgive Bahadir.

528
01:01:41,429 --> 01:01:44,229
He will try to find a way
to kill him eventually.

529
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:49,069
But what is important for us is
to make Ertuğrul to go to Cavdar Tribe.

530
01:01:49,949 --> 01:01:50,949
Will he, sir?

531
01:01:51,469 --> 01:01:52,389
He will.

532
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:55,909
He will go there when he learns
Bahadir overtook the tribe.

533
01:01:58,989 --> 01:02:01,309
And I will set a trap for him on the road.

534
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:02,309
Yes.

535
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:04,549
When Ertuğrul gets the invitation,

536
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:07,749
he will use this road
to go to Cavdar Tribe.

537
01:02:08,509 --> 01:02:10,349
And you will set your trap here.

538
01:02:11,189 --> 01:02:14,949
I am very grateful to you for giving me
the honor of killing Ertuğrul.

539
01:02:15,789 --> 01:02:17,549
I can't leave my castle, Titan.

540
01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:20,829
That's why I am giving this honor to you.

541
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:23,869
Take a troop with you,
full of your best soldiers.

542
01:02:24,709 --> 01:02:26,549
That would be too many.

543
01:02:26,749 --> 01:02:28,509
Ertuğrul is not easy picking, Titan.

544
01:02:28,909 --> 01:02:32,149
I have witnessed that before,
and I won't leave it to chance.

545
01:02:32,589 --> 01:02:34,069
It's not that I don't trust you,

546
01:02:34,509 --> 01:02:37,869
but you will do as I say
to break the jinx this time, Titan.

547
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:40,149
As you wish.

548
01:02:42,589 --> 01:02:44,549
I will bring Ertuğrul's head to you.

549
01:02:45,989 --> 01:02:47,269
<i>Nobiscum deus.</i>

550
01:02:48,229 --> 01:02:49,749
May God be with us, Titan.

551
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:51,549
<i>Nobiscum deus.</i>

552
01:03:14,989 --> 01:03:17,389
These bastards want to
set a trap for Ertuğrul Bey.

553
01:03:18,589 --> 01:03:19,829
I cannot leave him alone.

554
01:03:22,189 --> 01:03:25,229
Sancar and Bahadir
are so blinded by anger.

555
01:03:25,949 --> 01:03:28,349
We must save ourselves
before Ertuğrul Bey comes.

556
01:03:28,989 --> 01:03:31,229
There will be a lot of blood,
if we can't stop them.

557
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:32,949
Almost done, Aslıhan.

558
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:35,829
We'll escape from the ropes.

559
01:03:36,869 --> 01:03:37,869
In the name of God.

560
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:43,189
-Turgut.
-Aslıhan, go there.

561
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:47,429
You were like lions in your tent.

562
01:04:48,469 --> 01:04:49,469
Now,

563
01:04:49,909 --> 01:04:51,589
you look like a couple of sheep.

564
01:04:54,629 --> 01:04:55,669
We will kill you,

565
01:04:56,509 --> 01:04:58,669
and your leader, and then...

566
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:03,029
cut your heads off,
and display them in front of the tent,

567
01:05:04,149 --> 01:05:05,309
then you will see

568
01:05:06,629 --> 01:05:08,309
who is the lion, and who is the sheep.

569
01:06:05,349 --> 01:06:06,469
What is it, Son?

570
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:08,589
You look upset.

571
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:11,469
We should be the ones
who kill that bastard, Father.

572
01:06:13,229 --> 01:06:15,749
Don't you understand that

573
01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:17,549
Ares saved us a lot of trouble?

574
01:06:18,869 --> 01:06:21,389
Our hands will be free
of the margrave's blood.

575
01:06:22,389 --> 01:06:24,909
We will not attract the Sultan's anger.

576
01:06:25,909 --> 01:06:27,429
Your mother is right.

577
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:31,629
Ertuğrul isn't worth
getting our hands dirty,

578
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:34,869
and coming into conflict with our state.

579
01:06:37,189 --> 01:06:38,509
You will

580
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:40,909
content yourself with Turgut's head.

581
01:06:41,909 --> 01:06:43,229
As you wish, Bey.

582
01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:46,069
Kaya Tekin!

583
01:06:51,869 --> 01:06:53,589
-Yes, Bey.
-Now,

584
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:54,989
go to Kayi Tribe.

585
01:06:55,989 --> 01:06:57,069
Tell Ertuğrul Bey that

586
01:06:57,469 --> 01:06:59,429
I have become the bey of Cavdar Tribe

587
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,149
by gaining approval from all the beys',

588
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:05,789
and I invite him over to my tent

589
01:07:06,149 --> 01:07:08,069
to talk to him tomorrow.

590
01:07:08,469 --> 01:07:09,589
As you wish, Bey.

591
01:07:28,149 --> 01:07:30,229
How is it going at the armory, Artuk Bey?

592
01:07:30,669 --> 01:07:32,669
Everybody is working hard, Bey.

593
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:34,189
And I stand over them,

594
01:07:34,309 --> 01:07:37,229
and do whatever it takes
to complete them quickly.

595
01:07:38,269 --> 01:07:40,509
-Thank you.
-We are all working hard.

596
01:07:40,749 --> 01:07:42,869
We are doing our best, Bey.

597
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:44,469
We will finish them in time.

598
01:07:44,589 --> 01:07:45,629
Don't you worry.

599
01:07:46,469 --> 01:07:47,469
Thank you, brother.

600
01:07:49,909 --> 01:07:53,229
-Any news on Turgut Alp?
-No news, Bey. He hasn't come yet.

601
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:56,149
I hope he is all right.

602
01:07:57,469 --> 01:07:59,069
<i>May I come in, Bey?</i>

603
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:00,909
Come in, Dumrul.

604
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:08,869
You summoned us, Bey.

605
01:08:09,749 --> 01:08:12,149
I've charged you with the duty of watching
the castle's gates,

606
01:08:12,229 --> 01:08:13,629
and the road of Nicaea.

607
01:08:14,669 --> 01:08:15,709
Have you seen anybody

608
01:08:16,389 --> 01:08:17,429
going in and out?

609
01:08:17,749 --> 01:08:20,949
We always have our eyes
on the gates, Bey.

610
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:22,469
Nobody has come in or out.

611
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:24,389
There was no one, Bey.

612
01:08:24,549 --> 01:08:26,909
It is the same at our post, Bey.

613
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:36,709
Since no one has come out from the gates,

614
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:39,429
there must be a secret door.

615
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,669
They used that door to go out and attack.

616
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:44,109
Otherwise,

617
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:47,389
they couldn't have
come near the catapults.

618
01:08:48,909 --> 01:08:50,029
What's on your mind, Bey?

619
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:53,509
Atsız must have learned something.

620
01:08:54,109 --> 01:08:55,389
If he can,

621
01:08:55,709 --> 01:08:57,989
he will tell us where this secret door is.

622
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:00,589
But we won't stand idle.

623
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:02,989
Bamsi.

624
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,869
You will deploy the alps.

625
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:08,309
They will search for the secret door
without letting anybody know.

626
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:10,189
As you wish, Bey.

627
01:09:11,429 --> 01:09:12,429
If we find it,

628
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:14,829
all of Ares's hopes will perish.

629
01:09:15,669 --> 01:09:16,669
And then,

630
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:20,349
he cannot do anything
but wait for us to attack.

631
01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:15,589
What do you want, Merchant Niko?

632
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:18,989
Sir, I am here

633
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:21,429
to talk about Hanlı Bazaar.

634
01:10:26,029 --> 01:10:28,349
I know, Niko,
you are confined to my castle.

635
01:10:29,349 --> 01:10:31,749
You came here for trading, and gold,

636
01:10:31,869 --> 01:10:33,189
but Ertuğrul wanted a war.

637
01:10:37,469 --> 01:10:38,669
I know that

638
01:10:39,149 --> 01:10:40,349
victory will be ours, sir.

639
01:10:40,789 --> 01:10:41,909
I have no doubt about it.

640
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:45,029
That's why I want to go to Nicaea,
and make arrangements

641
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:47,829
for the new order you will put in place.

642
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:50,069
I can't afford for you to leave, Niko.

643
01:10:51,509 --> 01:10:52,829
I need you here.

644
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,709
And you are responsible
for the castle's gold.

645
01:10:58,589 --> 01:11:01,269
-Sir, we don't know how long--
-Enough!

646
01:11:02,789 --> 01:11:04,149
I said I need you here.

647
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:07,069
Ertuğrul will die tomorrow.

648
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:09,709
And you will be my side when he dies.

649
01:11:09,989 --> 01:11:12,309
Then you will become
the head of Hanlı Bazaar.

650
01:11:20,069 --> 01:11:21,429
You summoned me, sir.

651
01:11:23,309 --> 01:11:25,189
Pray for us, Niko.

652
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:27,149
May this war end soon.

653
01:11:29,549 --> 01:11:30,549
My prayers...

654
01:11:31,709 --> 01:11:32,869
are always with you,

655
01:11:33,429 --> 01:11:34,909
-sir.
-The door!

656
01:11:41,389 --> 01:11:42,389
Gregoryus.

657
01:11:43,469 --> 01:11:45,549
Use the secret door,
don't let any alps see you.

658
01:11:45,909 --> 01:11:47,549
Send this letter to the Emperor.

659
01:12:18,949 --> 01:12:19,949
Thank God.

660
01:12:20,109 --> 01:12:20,949
Hurry.

661
01:12:21,109 --> 01:12:22,109
Thank God.

662
01:12:35,389 --> 01:12:36,949
So, you are trying to escape.

663
01:12:37,509 --> 01:12:39,109
-Aslıhan, watch out.
-Alps!

664
01:12:40,909 --> 01:12:41,909
You corrupt...

665
01:12:44,349 --> 01:12:45,189
Aslıhan!

666
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:46,749
You corrupt...

667
01:12:51,469 --> 01:12:52,469
Turgut.

668
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:53,669
Let go of me!

669
01:13:05,629 --> 01:13:09,909
Ertuğrul Bey will bring you
and your father to your knees again.

670
01:13:10,189 --> 01:13:14,629
But, no one will save your heads this time
when you are down.

671
01:13:19,109 --> 01:13:23,989
Do you think your Ertuğrul Bey
can come here and save you?

672
01:13:26,029 --> 01:13:27,429
He is already defeated.

673
01:13:31,589 --> 01:13:33,469
Get out of here, Sancar.

674
01:13:34,029 --> 01:13:35,029
Get out!

675
01:13:35,229 --> 01:13:36,549
Don't you say anything!

676
01:13:37,029 --> 01:13:39,189
You got in way over your head!

677
01:13:39,509 --> 01:13:40,989
You set people against each other!

678
01:13:41,469 --> 01:13:42,549
All of this happened

679
01:13:42,789 --> 01:13:44,109
because of your stubbornness,

680
01:13:44,909 --> 01:13:46,429
your ambition for leadership!

681
01:14:09,629 --> 01:14:10,629
Turgut!

682
01:14:11,589 --> 01:14:12,589
Turgut!

683
01:14:18,029 --> 01:14:21,309
No, you will not die easily.

684
01:14:22,429 --> 01:14:24,549
I will torment you so badly...

685
01:14:25,949 --> 01:14:28,109
you will beg me to kill you.

686
01:14:29,229 --> 01:14:30,069
Alps!

687
01:14:30,349 --> 01:14:31,509
Chain them up.

688
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:33,509
Put a guard to watch over them.

689
01:14:38,109 --> 01:14:39,109
You corrupt...

690
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:40,469
You will get what you deserve!

691
01:14:41,429 --> 01:14:42,269
Let go of me!

692
01:15:16,469 --> 01:15:17,549
Son.

693
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:18,709
Mother.

694
01:15:26,949 --> 01:15:27,949
As you command,

695
01:15:28,709 --> 01:15:30,749
we are doing everything we can

696
01:15:30,909 --> 01:15:33,109
for our martyrs' funerals.

697
01:15:35,469 --> 01:15:36,469
Thank you, Mother.

698
01:15:38,469 --> 01:15:41,589
Hereafter, our martyrs' children
are my own children.

699
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:45,549
They will wear the same as my children.

700
01:15:46,389 --> 01:15:50,549
They will eat the same as my children.

701
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:55,029
We will bring up our children well,
Mother.

702
01:15:57,789 --> 01:15:59,669
May God bless you for that, Son.

703
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:03,429
May God give you a long life.

704
01:16:04,669 --> 01:16:05,669
Thank you, Mother.

705
01:16:24,589 --> 01:16:25,589
Son...

706
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:29,629
I know you have a heavy burden.

707
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,789
There will be many obstacles on your path.

708
01:16:35,589 --> 01:16:37,989
But our Lord says,

709
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:39,989
"On no soul does God

710
01:16:40,789 --> 01:16:44,909
place a burden greater than it can bear."

711
01:16:49,989 --> 01:16:52,189
I am walking God's path, Mother.

712
01:16:53,189 --> 01:16:54,709
When I say, "Help me, God",

713
01:16:55,989 --> 01:16:57,109
all my troubles

714
01:16:57,669 --> 01:16:58,949
just go away.

715
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:15,189
And I pray to God for a way out now.

716
01:17:16,429 --> 01:17:17,429
I believe in him.

717
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:20,229
God will open that door for me.

718
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:25,869
Our Lord says,

719
01:17:26,789 --> 01:17:28,669
"With every difficulty,

720
01:17:29,869 --> 01:17:31,269
there is relief."

721
01:17:32,829 --> 01:17:34,229
Your intentions are good.

722
01:17:35,829 --> 01:17:39,229
Your way is God's way.

723
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:44,949
God will surely show you a way
out of this, Son.

724
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:48,869
Mother.

725
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:50,829
If you excuse me,

726
01:17:51,429 --> 01:17:52,789
I will go and pray now.

727
01:17:54,749 --> 01:17:55,749
May God accept it.

728
01:17:56,869 --> 01:17:57,869
Amen, Mother.

729
01:18:35,069 --> 01:18:36,069
Merchant Niko.

730
01:18:36,469 --> 01:18:37,749
What are you doing here?

731
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:41,429
It is not Niko,

732
01:18:41,829 --> 01:18:42,669
it is Atsız.

733
01:19:05,389 --> 01:19:06,389
Good.

734
01:19:06,989 --> 01:19:09,429
This letter will open
all the doors for me.

735
01:20:14,789 --> 01:20:15,789
My Lord,

736
01:20:17,029 --> 01:20:19,029
I seek to live for your justice,

737
01:20:19,789 --> 01:20:22,349
and fight for your justice.

738
01:20:23,629 --> 01:20:25,269
Do not let me be

739
01:20:26,229 --> 01:20:30,469
defeated by the enemy, I don't want to
let down my tribe or my people.

740
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:32,829
My Lord,

741
01:20:33,789 --> 01:20:35,709
you can do the impossible.

742
01:20:37,789 --> 01:20:40,429
Make me victorious in this holy war.

743
01:20:41,749 --> 01:20:44,509
You have the power to open all the doors.

744
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:47,749
Show me a way out of this.

745
01:20:49,949 --> 01:20:52,589
Out of respect to Muhammad the Prophet,

746
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:55,109
accept my prayers.

747
01:21:21,789 --> 01:21:23,109
With Tekfur Ares's order,

748
01:21:23,349 --> 01:21:25,109
I will take this letter to the Emperor.

749
01:21:28,189 --> 01:21:29,189
Tell me your name.

750
01:21:31,389 --> 01:21:32,389
Gregoryus.

751
01:21:33,109 --> 01:21:35,189
Use the secret door,
don't let alps see you.

752
01:21:35,549 --> 01:21:37,389
Send this letter to the Emperor.

753
01:21:38,429 --> 01:21:39,429
Gregoryus.

754
01:21:40,269 --> 01:21:41,269
Okay, you can pass.

755
01:22:09,389 --> 01:22:10,949
<i>May I come in, Bey?</i>

756
01:22:12,989 --> 01:22:13,989
Come in, Bamsi.

757
01:22:18,829 --> 01:22:19,829
Bey.

758
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:22,109
Bahadir Bey has sent his alp.

759
01:22:22,709 --> 01:22:24,229
He wants to say something to you.

760
01:22:25,269 --> 01:22:26,269
Bahadir Bey?

761
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:28,589
Where is Turgut, then?

762
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:31,469
I don't know, Bey, the alp came alone.

763
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:33,989
Let him come in.

764
01:22:34,869 --> 01:22:36,789
-We will find out.
-Yes, Bey.

765
01:22:37,989 --> 01:22:38,989
Let him come in!

766
01:22:52,109 --> 01:22:53,109
Speak.

767
01:22:53,549 --> 01:22:56,229
Ertuğrul Bey,
I brought you greetings from Bahadir Bey.

768
01:22:59,029 --> 01:23:00,029
Where is your Bey?

769
01:23:00,749 --> 01:23:01,749
He is at Cavdar Tribe.

770
01:23:03,509 --> 01:23:05,629
Bahadir Bey became the bey of the tribe

771
01:23:05,949 --> 01:23:08,069
by gaining all of the beys' approval.

772
01:23:08,829 --> 01:23:11,309
He invites you to his tent
to talk tomorrow.

773
01:23:13,229 --> 01:23:14,749
He became the bey?

774
01:23:18,109 --> 01:23:19,109
What do you mean?

775
01:23:20,589 --> 01:23:22,349
Where are Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut Alp?

776
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:26,389
Until Bahadir Bey talks to you
and you reaches an agreement,

777
01:23:26,829 --> 01:23:29,069
he will hold Aslıhan Hatun
and Turgut Alp as captives.

778
01:23:29,469 --> 01:23:30,469
Bey.

779
01:23:30,909 --> 01:23:31,909
Bey, what is he saying?

780
01:23:32,029 --> 01:23:34,349
They hold Turgut
and Aslıhan Hatun as captives.

781
01:23:38,909 --> 01:23:42,349
So... that's why the
bastard that is your bey

782
01:23:43,109 --> 01:23:45,549
abandoned us on the battlefield.

783
01:23:48,029 --> 01:23:49,669
When we were fighting on the battlefield,

784
01:23:50,309 --> 01:23:52,589
he went to the tribe
and took it, didn't he?

785
01:23:55,149 --> 01:23:58,189
He both betrayed us
and rebelled against us.

786
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:05,109
Go and tell him...

787
01:24:06,509 --> 01:24:08,669
that Ertuğrul bey will come to his tent,

788
01:24:09,869 --> 01:24:12,709
not to make a deal...

789
01:24:14,389 --> 01:24:17,589
but to hold him accountable
for the crimes he has committed.

790
01:24:21,469 --> 01:24:25,669
Tell him... he won't get up
from his knees this time.

791
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:31,269
Go.

792
01:24:43,269 --> 01:24:45,629
My Bey, my Bey, that dog

793
01:24:45,709 --> 01:24:48,109
is holding Aslihan Hatun
and my brother Turgut prisoner.

794
01:24:48,189 --> 01:24:49,869
We should have held on to him, my Bey.

795
01:24:50,229 --> 01:24:52,949
Even if he is the dog of that bastard,
we won't touch a messenger.

796
01:24:53,429 --> 01:24:54,509
Let him go.

797
01:24:55,429 --> 01:24:58,029
Let him go and tell Bahadir what we said.

798
01:25:00,149 --> 01:25:01,429
Let him speak...

799
01:25:02,349 --> 01:25:05,389
so that Bahadir may appreciate the
power of the storm brewing against him.

800
01:25:05,989 --> 01:25:07,389
What's happened, my son?

801
01:25:11,309 --> 01:25:12,949
That bastard Bahadir, Mother...

802
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,429
He's keeping Turgut and Aslihan
Hatun prisoner at the tribe.

803
01:25:17,549 --> 01:25:20,789
-What?
-Fiend, bastard!

804
01:25:22,589 --> 01:25:27,669
What kind of a treachery is this
while the battlefield still blazes?

805
01:25:28,989 --> 01:25:30,589
He conspired with Ares, Mother.

806
01:25:31,909 --> 01:25:34,789
He betrayed our state to satisfy
his ambition to become bey.

807
01:25:36,789 --> 01:25:39,109
He had a hand
in the burning of the catapults, too.

808
01:25:41,189 --> 01:25:44,189
Treachery runs through
his veins like blood, Mother.

809
01:25:46,069 --> 01:25:50,229
But, I swear, with my sword...

810
01:25:50,909 --> 01:25:52,429
I will make that treachery flow.

811
01:25:56,509 --> 01:25:59,029
-Bamsı, get ready, we ride.
-As you wish, my Bey.

812
01:26:01,749 --> 01:26:02,789
Mother.

813
01:26:04,109 --> 01:26:06,989
Tell Artuk Bey to join
the funeral prayer in my name.

814
01:26:07,509 --> 01:26:09,749
He should accompany
the families of the martyrs.

815
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:13,629
You will accompany the women.

816
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:16,629
Don't worry, son. Don't worry.

817
01:26:17,789 --> 01:26:19,269
Let them not feel our absence.

818
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:32,909
My God, one disaster follows another...

819
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:38,269
Grant power and strength to Ertuğrul Bey.

820
01:28:25,029 --> 01:28:28,149
This is the best place to set an ambush
on the way to the Cavdar tribe.

821
01:28:28,589 --> 01:28:31,469
When Ertuğrul comes,
we'll surround him quickly.

822
01:28:33,269 --> 01:28:35,469
He is not to get out of this ambush alive.

823
01:28:35,709 --> 01:28:37,229
Everybody take their places!

824
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:52,029
Come now, Ertuğrul Bey.

825
01:28:53,309 --> 01:28:56,269
My sword will finally shine red
with the blood of a powerful Turk.

826
01:29:04,109 --> 01:29:05,149
Take my horse.

827
01:29:19,509 --> 01:29:20,669
What's this, Atsiz?

828
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:22,709
I have important intelligence,
Ertuğrul Bey.

829
01:29:24,429 --> 01:29:26,109
There is a secret passage into the castle.

830
01:29:27,269 --> 01:29:29,829
Ares sent a messenger
to the emperor with a letter.

831
01:29:30,869 --> 01:29:34,509
I caught the messenger before he left
the castle and escaped in his clothes.

832
01:29:35,469 --> 01:29:38,269
-And I also have letter.
-Very good.

833
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:47,029
Everything he was plotting
with Bahadir Bey is written down here.

834
01:29:47,389 --> 01:29:50,989
They planned to ambush you.
Thank God I got here in time, my Bey.

835
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:04,429
So that's why he sent a messenger
inviting me to come to the tribe.

836
01:30:05,349 --> 01:30:08,229
They were going to
ambush me on my way there.

837
01:30:09,989 --> 01:30:11,949
There's no time to lose, Atsiz.

838
01:30:12,029 --> 01:30:13,669
We have to save Aslihan Hatun

839
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:16,269
and Turgut Alp from this bastard
as soon as we can.

840
01:30:16,789 --> 01:30:18,389
Then we make him pay.

841
01:30:19,629 --> 01:30:21,669
I know where they set the ambush, my Bey.

842
01:30:22,429 --> 01:30:25,909
-On the road we always use?
-That's right.

843
01:30:27,669 --> 01:30:29,949
There's another route
to the Cavdar tribe up ahead.

844
01:30:30,629 --> 01:30:33,429
Bamsı, Abdurrahman and I
will get to the Cavdar tribe that way.

845
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:37,949
You will continue on this road
and deal with their ambush, Atsiz.

846
01:30:38,549 --> 01:30:42,789
Don't worry, my Bey.
We'll trap them in their own trap.

847
01:30:43,429 --> 01:30:44,469
Very good.

848
01:30:46,949 --> 01:30:48,549
Günküt, Dumrul!

849
01:30:48,989 --> 01:30:51,229
After you've finished with Ares' men,

850
01:30:51,309 --> 01:30:53,189
get to the Cavdar tribe
as quickly as you can.

851
01:30:53,309 --> 01:30:55,229
Some of you surround the tribe,

852
01:30:55,429 --> 01:30:57,589
the rest of you enter it and be ready.

853
01:30:57,709 --> 01:30:59,749
-As you command, my Bey.
-As you command, my Bey.

854
01:31:00,509 --> 01:31:03,189
Atsiz, after you've
dealt with the soldiers,

855
01:31:03,509 --> 01:31:05,469
join the alps at the siege.

856
01:31:05,589 --> 01:31:09,109
As soon as we're done
at the Cavdar tribe, we'll join you there.

857
01:31:09,349 --> 01:31:11,149
We'll go through the passage
when night falls.

858
01:31:11,269 --> 01:31:14,949
This will all be over tonight, Atsiz.
Get the alps ready right away.

859
01:31:15,989 --> 01:31:18,629
May God be with us, alps.

860
01:31:18,989 --> 01:31:20,269
Amen, my Bey!

861
01:31:22,389 --> 01:31:24,749
-Come on!
-In the name of God!

862
01:31:29,829 --> 01:31:31,309
In the name of God!

863
01:31:52,629 --> 01:31:55,749
I wish the news of
Ertuğrul's death would come.

864
01:31:56,589 --> 01:31:58,349
The longer we wait, the more tense I feel.

865
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:01,189
Why are you tense?

866
01:32:01,669 --> 01:32:04,549
One way or the other, Ertuğrul will die.

867
01:32:05,869 --> 01:32:10,229
You say that, my Bey,
but you don't seem that relaxed either.

868
01:32:11,189 --> 01:32:12,989
Something's gnawing at your insides.

869
01:32:14,869 --> 01:32:17,189
If you have something
to say, say it, wife.

870
01:32:17,869 --> 01:32:23,149
Stop beating about the bush.
Just tell me what it is you want to say.

871
01:32:24,309 --> 01:32:27,389
My Bey, Ertuğrul has
the nine lives of a cat.

872
01:32:28,429 --> 01:32:30,229
What if he eludes
the ambush and comes here?

873
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:34,309
What if he realizes
it was you and Ares who set it up?

874
01:32:36,749 --> 01:32:40,949
What's done is done, woman.

875
01:32:41,949 --> 01:32:46,629
If he escapes the trap Ares has set,
and doesn't recognize my beyhood...

876
01:32:47,749 --> 01:32:51,869
Ertuğrul will meet his death
by my own hand.

877
01:33:36,589 --> 01:33:37,549
Come on then.

878
01:33:39,069 --> 01:33:40,869
You won't be able to
save yourself this time.

879
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:04,669
Alps are approaching
but Ertuğrul isn't with them.

880
01:34:06,509 --> 01:34:09,269
-What do mean, Ertuğrul isn't with them?
-I'm sure I didn't see him, sir.

881
01:34:09,589 --> 01:34:11,989
We checked everyone.
Ertuğrul isn't with them.

882
01:34:16,869 --> 01:34:20,109
He must have suspected it was a trap.
He sent his alps instead.

883
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:23,669
He'll go straight to the Cavdar tribe.

884
01:34:26,589 --> 01:34:29,509
-What do we do?
-Kill them all.

885
01:34:31,229 --> 01:34:32,429
Bring my horse.

886
01:34:33,989 --> 01:34:35,189
I'll ride to the Cavdar tribe.

887
01:34:36,109 --> 01:34:39,229
Whatever happens, Ertuğrul dies today.

888
01:34:40,069 --> 01:34:41,389
Come with me.

889
01:35:03,429 --> 01:35:05,589
It's one trouble after another.

890
01:35:06,229 --> 01:35:10,509
Whenever we try to achieve something,
a thousand misfortunes haunt us.

891
01:35:12,909 --> 01:35:15,789
My Ertuğrul cleared the way
for that snake Bahadir,

892
01:35:16,229 --> 01:35:19,149
so that he might walk the right path
instead of a crooked one.

893
01:35:19,989 --> 01:35:22,229
But he closed the door on that himself.

894
01:35:22,509 --> 01:35:25,189
Well, he'll pay for it, of course he will.

895
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:28,629
But why does he keep
Aslihan Hatun and Turgut Alp captive

896
01:35:28,869 --> 01:35:30,709
and just sit in his tent, Mother?

897
01:35:32,029 --> 01:35:34,229
What despicable work he has done.

898
01:35:35,349 --> 01:35:36,589
But he'll see.

899
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:39,709
My Ertuğrul Bey will surely
put an end to it this time.

900
01:35:44,549 --> 01:35:46,509
-My Gündüz.
-Mother.

901
01:35:47,709 --> 01:35:50,189
Did you talk to your brothers, Gündüz?

902
01:35:50,349 --> 01:35:53,269
I did, Mother. I consoled them.

903
01:35:53,549 --> 01:35:56,149
I told them to come to me
if anything was wrong.

904
01:35:56,789 --> 01:35:59,709
Good for you, Gündüz. Good job.

905
01:35:59,869 --> 01:36:03,989
Hafsa, my girl, is everything
ready for the funeral meals?

906
01:36:04,429 --> 01:36:08,509
Everything is ready, Mother.
The pots are boiling, the food is ready.

907
01:36:08,869 --> 01:36:12,589
All right then, let us go and give
our condolences to the people.

908
01:36:14,469 --> 01:36:15,989
Come on, Gündüz, come.

909
01:36:54,349 --> 01:36:55,309
Surrender!

910
01:37:01,909 --> 01:37:03,429
Come on then, you bastards!

911
01:37:13,149 --> 01:37:14,109
Come on, alps!

912
01:37:14,789 --> 01:37:15,829
Come on, alps!

913
01:37:17,229 --> 01:37:20,469
It's time for battle!
No infidel leaves here alive!

914
01:37:20,669 --> 01:37:21,829
In the name of God!

915
01:37:28,149 --> 01:37:29,349
<i>Allahuakbar</i>!

916
01:37:39,949 --> 01:37:41,309
<i>Allahuakbar!</i>

917
01:38:46,869 --> 01:38:47,869
Come on!

918
01:38:53,349 --> 01:38:54,829
Titan isn't among them.

919
01:38:55,469 --> 01:38:57,069
He might close the secret passage.

920
01:38:58,669 --> 01:38:59,829
Bring my horse.

921
01:39:00,909 --> 01:39:03,389
I'll go defend the gate to the passage.

922
01:39:04,429 --> 01:39:07,989
I must stop Titan.
I'll wait for Ertuğrul Bey there.

923
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:11,909
I hope you finish off Bahadir Bey
and get back in one piece.

924
01:39:12,149 --> 01:39:13,309
-God willing.
-God willing.

925
01:39:19,749 --> 01:39:20,749
Come on!

926
01:39:31,989 --> 01:39:33,349
Ertuğrul Bey still hasn't come.

927
01:39:35,909 --> 01:39:37,269
He'll be here, eventually.

928
01:39:38,509 --> 01:39:42,149
Ertuğrul wanted to destroy our tribe
with his games but you put a stop to that.

929
01:39:44,429 --> 01:39:48,269
God willing...
I'll put a stop to the ones in Konya, too.

930
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:54,069
It's time our sultan learned
what an ambitious and vindictive man

931
01:39:55,229 --> 01:39:56,869
Ertuğrul really is.

932
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:58,629
-God willing, my Bey.
-God willing, my Bey.

933
01:40:11,749 --> 01:40:12,869
My Bey.

934
01:40:15,069 --> 01:40:18,309
Ertuğrul Bey is nearing the tribe
with two of his alps.

935
01:40:52,669 --> 01:40:53,829
Then...

936
01:41:00,869 --> 01:41:04,189
let us welcome our margrave.

937
01:41:08,429 --> 01:41:09,589
After you, Beys.

938
01:41:23,069 --> 01:41:24,909
How did he survive Ares' ambush, Father?

939
01:41:26,589 --> 01:41:27,869
How can this be, my Bey?

940
01:41:28,389 --> 01:41:31,309
We should be welcoming him dead,
not alive and well.

941
01:41:34,069 --> 01:41:35,669
Maybe he saw through the trap.

942
01:41:36,869 --> 01:41:40,829
If that's the case,
he comes here knowing everything.

943
01:41:42,789 --> 01:41:47,709
Let's just invite him into the tent.
Then we'll see.

944
01:41:49,189 --> 01:41:54,789
If he knows everything,
my tent will be his grave.

945
01:41:57,829 --> 01:42:02,949
Sancar, whatever you do,
don't give away our plan.

946
01:42:03,709 --> 01:42:06,629
Keep a tight hold of your anger.

947
01:42:07,189 --> 01:42:11,229
Otherwise, this tent will
be our graves instead.

948
01:42:12,029 --> 01:42:13,389
Understand, Sancar?

949
01:42:14,869 --> 01:42:17,749
-I understand, Father.
-Good.

950
01:42:20,229 --> 01:42:21,549
-Kayatekin.
-Yes, my Bey.

951
01:42:22,109 --> 01:42:24,309
Go keep guard of Aslihan and Turgut.

952
01:42:24,869 --> 01:42:27,389
-Stay alert.
-As you command, my Bey.

953
01:42:52,829 --> 01:42:56,669
Neither Ertuğrul nor his alps are wounded.
They can't have fallen for the trap.

954
01:42:57,029 --> 01:42:59,749
You must find some way
of making him accept you as the bey.

955
01:43:00,549 --> 01:43:01,949
This does not bode well.

956
01:43:02,589 --> 01:43:05,669
If you kill him here,
you'll have to take on the sultan, too

957
01:43:06,309 --> 01:43:09,149
You will have rebelled against the state.
The penalty will be far harsher.

958
01:43:11,549 --> 01:43:15,669
He didn't send his son into exile,
he had him gather the alps to rebel.

959
01:43:15,829 --> 01:43:18,709
He has a death wish, my Bey.
We should grant it.

960
01:43:23,349 --> 01:43:25,229
Just look how he carries himself!

961
01:43:28,189 --> 01:43:30,589
He acts like he has an army
beside him, not two alps.

962
01:43:53,229 --> 01:43:58,309
Thank you for accepting my invitation
and coming to see me, Ertuğrul Bey.

963
01:44:01,029 --> 01:44:01,909
Come in.

964
01:44:04,229 --> 01:44:06,309
We have been preparing for your arrival.

965
01:44:06,989 --> 01:44:09,469
Let's talk and eat a nice meal?

966
01:44:11,749 --> 01:44:13,629
Where are Turgut and Aslihan?

967
01:44:16,669 --> 01:44:20,269
Don't worry about them. They're safe.

968
01:44:25,789 --> 01:44:27,909
Let's have that conversation.

969
01:44:29,189 --> 01:44:31,789
Then we will invite them to eat.

970
01:44:33,269 --> 01:44:34,429
Come in.

971
01:44:41,309 --> 01:44:42,389
Abdurrahman.

972
01:44:44,669 --> 01:44:47,469
-Wait outside.
-As you wish, my Bey.

973
01:45:45,429 --> 01:45:46,629
Stay standing.

974
01:45:58,589 --> 01:46:00,109
Now tell me.

975
01:46:01,589 --> 01:46:02,749
What has happened here...

976
01:46:03,549 --> 01:46:04,909
while I was at war,

977
01:46:05,029 --> 01:46:06,989
despite the Cavdar tribe being
under my protection?

978
01:46:17,189 --> 01:46:22,829
The tribe had an internal issue...
which has now been dealt with.

979
01:46:24,069 --> 01:46:26,029
I took what was rightfully mine.

980
01:46:27,109 --> 01:46:28,109
That's what happened.

981
01:46:30,469 --> 01:46:32,549
Don't worry about Turgut and Aslihan.

982
01:46:33,789 --> 01:46:36,189
After you recognize my beyhood...

983
01:46:36,669 --> 01:46:40,189
I will surrender them to you,
Ertuğrul Bey.

984
01:46:42,669 --> 01:46:45,029
What is this beyhood
you speak of, Bahadir Bey?

985
01:46:45,869 --> 01:46:48,989
The one you tried to claim by spilling
the blood of your own kin?

986
01:46:50,149 --> 01:46:51,109
Did you not know?

987
01:46:53,309 --> 01:46:57,669
Those who come by blood... go by blood!

988
01:47:06,709 --> 01:47:08,909
You didn't even grant us an election

989
01:47:09,429 --> 01:47:11,589
so that I may have taken
what is rightfully mine.

990
01:47:12,149 --> 01:47:16,509
You wanted to make the bey
someone who is not of our blood!

991
01:47:18,429 --> 01:47:23,229
A couple of insolent men
who would not accept my beyhood...

992
01:47:24,749 --> 01:47:27,909
they got what they deserved, that's all.

993
01:47:34,189 --> 01:47:35,949
What about the beys...

994
01:47:37,669 --> 01:47:40,229
loyal to Aslihan Hatun?

995
01:47:42,069 --> 01:47:43,389
Why do you stay silent?

996
01:47:48,309 --> 01:47:49,509
Did Bahadir Bey

997
01:47:50,229 --> 01:47:55,109
tie your tongues with the gold Ares
gave him to buy out Hanli bazaar?

998
01:47:58,309 --> 01:47:59,429
Tell me!

999
01:47:59,509 --> 01:48:01,709
What is this, Ertuğrul Bey?
We can't be bought.

1000
01:48:01,989 --> 01:48:05,069
You are for sale,
you violate our rights and customs.

1001
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:08,029
You shame the Cavdar name!

1002
01:48:08,909 --> 01:48:10,469
You have violated its honor!

1003
01:48:11,229 --> 01:48:15,069
You have sullied Aliyar Bey's
cherished memory!

1004
01:48:15,189 --> 01:48:16,429
Ertuğrul Bey!

1005
01:48:24,429 --> 01:48:25,549
Ertuğrul Bey.

1006
01:48:27,309 --> 01:48:31,869
You are here in my tribe,
sitting on my seat,

1007
01:48:31,989 --> 01:48:33,669
and I have had enough!

1008
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:41,189
I intended to put my alps under
your command and fight alongside you.

1009
01:48:45,349 --> 01:48:48,629
But you continue to slander me.

1010
01:48:50,669 --> 01:48:54,829
What makes you think
my spoils of war are Ares' gold?

1011
01:48:56,509 --> 01:48:59,429
I will not allow you to insult my beys.

1012
01:49:00,429 --> 01:49:03,669
They have shown how low they have fallen,

1013
01:49:04,589 --> 01:49:07,989
by betraying their tribe
and its traditions.

1014
01:49:17,349 --> 01:49:21,429
You should have taken better care
of your catapults.

1015
01:49:23,669 --> 01:49:25,509
Ares burned them to the ground.

1016
01:49:27,749 --> 01:49:31,229
You fell into every single one
of the infidel's traps.

1017
01:49:34,429 --> 01:49:38,069
But despite all of that...

1018
01:49:39,429 --> 01:49:43,989
we still wish to stand
by our state and by you.

1019
01:49:44,989 --> 01:49:47,229
May everyone in my tribe be my witness.

1020
01:49:48,109 --> 01:49:51,749
Recognize my beyhood
and we can figure this out peaceably.

1021
01:49:57,309 --> 01:50:02,709
First, bring Turgut Alp
and Aslihan Hatun here.

1022
01:50:09,509 --> 01:50:11,189
Then...

1023
01:50:23,109 --> 01:50:28,709
we can talk again about your betrayal
and your collaboration with Governor Ares.

1024
01:51:03,269 --> 01:51:04,389
Your bey...

1025
01:51:06,389 --> 01:51:07,829
has finally arrived.

1026
01:51:09,549 --> 01:51:11,869
Thank God. Thank God...

1027
01:51:13,629 --> 01:51:16,069
-Where is he now?
-In the tent.

1028
01:51:18,149 --> 01:51:20,269
He is in council with Bahadir Bey.

1029
01:51:27,989 --> 01:51:29,269
In council?

1030
01:51:30,749 --> 01:51:33,989
What? Why not?

1031
01:51:36,909 --> 01:51:39,349
You should stop guarding us

1032
01:51:39,989 --> 01:51:42,669
and think about how you can
save your bey's head.

1033
01:51:44,429 --> 01:51:45,869
Don't get your hopes up.

1034
01:51:47,349 --> 01:51:50,429
He has no choice
but to recognize Bahadir Bey's beyhood

1035
01:51:50,949 --> 01:51:53,109
and both he and you will play nice.

1036
01:51:55,669 --> 01:51:57,549
Or the blood that flows...

1037
01:51:59,149 --> 01:52:01,109
and the lives that are lost will be yours.

1038
01:52:02,109 --> 01:52:03,589
Kayatekin...

1039
01:52:06,589 --> 01:52:09,669
We have known many
who have tried to tame us.

1040
01:52:10,469 --> 01:52:15,109
But all that's left of them
is a stain on our swords.

1041
01:52:16,869 --> 01:52:20,869
We're not like anyone else.
Haven't you learned that yet, Turgut?

1042
01:52:26,789 --> 01:52:30,029
To us, all bastards are the same.

1043
01:52:31,029 --> 01:52:34,749
Don't worry. We won't do you any favors.

1044
01:52:36,509 --> 01:52:38,749
You will share the same end.

1045
01:52:46,549 --> 01:52:50,389
You are not to speak anymore! Understand?

1046
01:52:58,589 --> 01:53:00,949
-What collaboration?
-You think we're traitors, Ertuğrul Bey?

1047
01:53:01,029 --> 01:53:03,269
-What collaboration?
-We're not traitors.

1048
01:53:05,789 --> 01:53:08,709
The gold for Hanli bazaar
has blinded you, beys.

1049
01:53:10,629 --> 01:53:13,509
You tried to make a man
who collaborated with Ares...

1050
01:53:13,909 --> 01:53:16,469
Bey of the honorable Cavdars.

1051
01:53:19,829 --> 01:53:23,789
The man responsible for burning
the catapults I had built for the siege,

1052
01:53:24,069 --> 01:53:27,709
and far worse,
for the killing of my alps...

1053
01:53:28,429 --> 01:53:29,669
is Bahadir Bey!

1054
01:53:35,269 --> 01:53:40,309
He and Ares formed
an alliance of evil against our state.

1055
01:53:40,989 --> 01:53:42,949
In this letter I hold before you...

1056
01:53:43,789 --> 01:53:46,589
Ares explains to his emperor

1057
01:53:46,749 --> 01:53:49,029
everything they've done together!

1058
01:53:49,429 --> 01:53:52,069
Liar! You slanderer!

1059
01:53:57,309 --> 01:53:59,629
The plots he and Bahadir hatched...

1060
01:54:00,069 --> 01:54:03,669
how he would ambush me on my way here,
how he intended to kill me...

1061
01:54:04,269 --> 01:54:06,469
it's all here, in this letter.

1062
01:54:11,949 --> 01:54:16,149
Know this, neither asking for mercy
nor begging for your lives...

1063
01:54:16,789 --> 01:54:18,189
will save you.

1064
01:54:20,349 --> 01:54:22,509
Just like Bahadir Bey...

1065
01:54:23,669 --> 01:54:26,669
you will pay the price of betrayal.

1066
01:54:30,269 --> 01:54:31,349
Lies!

1067
01:54:32,629 --> 01:54:35,949
Still you slander me! That letter is fake!

1068
01:54:36,429 --> 01:54:38,549
Your denials are for nothing, Bahadir Bey.

1069
01:54:40,389 --> 01:54:42,349
I have a spy inside the castle.

1070
01:54:46,909 --> 01:54:51,349
The contemptible tricks
you and Ares have played

1071
01:54:51,949 --> 01:54:54,149
have been revealed, one by one.

1072
01:54:54,789 --> 01:54:59,669
I did not betray my state.

1073
01:55:00,469 --> 01:55:01,669
Nor will I ever.

1074
01:55:03,309 --> 01:55:06,909
But if you keep this up...

1075
01:55:07,429 --> 01:55:10,309
know that I will take your head.

1076
01:55:12,749 --> 01:55:16,989
All we want is to further
the lineage of our fathers.

1077
01:55:17,989 --> 01:55:19,949
You cannot stop that.

1078
01:55:21,389 --> 01:55:24,709
You have desecrated the path
of the honorable Cavdar tribe.

1079
01:55:27,829 --> 01:55:31,589
You will pay the price with your lives.

1080
01:55:38,309 --> 01:55:39,509
Sancar, stop!

1081
01:55:49,989 --> 01:55:51,309
Sancar!

1082
01:56:10,909 --> 01:56:12,029
My son.

1083
01:56:12,629 --> 01:56:15,629
Ertuğrul keeps the Turk tribes unified.

1084
01:56:16,829 --> 01:56:18,429
They are empowered by him.

1085
01:56:19,469 --> 01:56:21,629
They are encouraged.

1086
01:56:22,109 --> 01:56:25,669
The tribes themselves are weak.
They couldn't survive without Ertuğrul.

1087
01:56:26,069 --> 01:56:28,749
When Ertuğrul is dead,
the Turk tribes will disperse.

1088
01:56:29,469 --> 01:56:33,349
That will be our chance to throw them
out of these lands once and for all.

1089
01:56:33,789 --> 01:56:35,309
What about Hanli bazaar, sir?

1090
01:56:37,229 --> 01:56:39,389
It's time we took that over too.

1091
01:56:40,309 --> 01:56:42,949
We will attack Hanli bazaar tonight.

1092
01:56:43,429 --> 01:56:45,989
We will inflict a second
fatal blow on the Turks.

1093
01:56:46,509 --> 01:56:49,109
When we return,
I will hold a great feast for everyone.

1094
01:56:57,349 --> 01:56:58,709
Sir, two of our men are missing.

1095
01:56:59,069 --> 01:57:00,549
What do you mean? Where could they be?

1096
01:57:01,029 --> 01:57:03,309
I don't know, sir.
We couldn't find them anywhere.

1097
01:57:05,069 --> 01:57:06,429
I will see to it myself, sir.

1098
01:57:14,869 --> 01:57:16,829
You killed my son!

1099
01:57:17,429 --> 01:57:20,829
I will kill your family!
I will burn down your tribe!

1100
01:57:21,109 --> 01:57:25,549
I will put your sons' heads on stakes
and plant them in the middle of the tribe!

1101
01:57:27,949 --> 01:57:29,069
Die!

1102
01:57:43,629 --> 01:57:45,549
I warned you that if
you didn't bow to me...

1103
01:57:46,189 --> 01:57:48,149
I would take your head, Bahadir Bey.

1104
01:57:50,829 --> 01:57:52,389
It's time you paid that price.

1105
01:58:24,749 --> 01:58:28,309
My Bey, we surrounded the tribe,
as you commanded.

1106
01:58:28,789 --> 01:58:30,309
We have it under our control.

1107
01:58:31,189 --> 01:58:34,109
-What are your orders?
-Good, men.

1108
01:58:35,269 --> 01:58:39,109
Take Bahadir Bey's alps' weapons.
And tie them up.

1109
01:58:39,309 --> 01:58:41,189
-As you command, my Bey!
-As you command, my Bey!

1110
01:58:42,549 --> 01:58:43,749
Bamsı.

1111
01:58:44,349 --> 01:58:46,669
Bring Aslihan Hatun and Turgut Alp to me.

1112
01:58:46,789 --> 01:58:48,349
Yes, my Bey.

1113
01:59:10,869 --> 01:59:12,109
I swore I would...

1114
01:59:13,429 --> 01:59:16,709
take the head of anyone
who refused to kneel before me.

1115
01:59:18,509 --> 01:59:20,749
One head is already on my sword.

1116
01:59:22,029 --> 01:59:26,669
Now, is there anyone else
here who refuses to kneel?

1117
01:59:45,189 --> 01:59:46,909
Aslihan, are you all right?

1118
01:59:49,349 --> 01:59:53,589
Didn't I tell you not to speak?
Don't open your mouth again!

1119
01:59:53,989 --> 01:59:56,029
What do you think you can do?

1120
01:59:56,629 --> 01:59:59,269
-Are you going to cut out our tongues?
-You talk too much.

1121
02:00:01,909 --> 02:00:03,109
I'm here, brother!

1122
02:00:19,269 --> 02:00:22,549
May you accompany your bey to hell.

1123
02:00:49,469 --> 02:00:52,949
Brother, hold on. Hold on.

1124
02:00:56,589 --> 02:00:57,709
Thank God.

1125
02:01:21,229 --> 02:01:23,389
The smell of the bodies led us here, sir.

1126
02:01:23,909 --> 02:01:28,229
-We found them like this.
-Who did this, Kostas? Who?

1127
02:01:30,229 --> 02:01:31,949
Ertuğrul is behind this, sir.

1128
02:01:33,309 --> 02:01:34,509
How so?

1129
02:01:35,709 --> 02:01:38,829
Are you telling me
Ertuğrul has a spy in the castle?

1130
02:01:39,549 --> 02:01:41,669
-Yes, sir.
-Who is it, Kostas?

1131
02:01:43,109 --> 02:01:45,989
Who? Find him!

1132
02:01:46,869 --> 02:01:48,829
Question everyone in the castle!

1133
02:01:49,029 --> 02:01:53,949
All the new men, everyone! Even
the civilians outside! Find him for me!

1134
02:01:54,669 --> 02:01:55,749
Yes, sir.

1135
02:02:15,109 --> 02:02:17,349
You didn't leave us to die
at the hands of that bastard.

1136
02:02:18,749 --> 02:02:19,989
Thank you, brother.

1137
02:02:20,269 --> 02:02:24,389
Brother, your life is my life!
How could I leave you?

1138
02:02:29,189 --> 02:02:31,029
Did our bey do away
with that dog, Bahadir?

1139
02:02:31,309 --> 02:02:33,349
He did, my brother. Yes, he did.

1140
02:02:33,629 --> 02:02:35,989
Free Aslihan Hatun
and let's go to the tent.

1141
02:02:36,149 --> 02:02:37,549
Ertuğrul Bey is waiting for you.

1142
02:03:29,274 --> 02:03:32,794
<i>Where the hell is that idiot soldier?</i>
<i>What's going on at the tribe?</i>

1143
02:03:39,594 --> 02:03:40,754
What did you learn?

1144
02:03:40,874 --> 02:03:44,114
Sir, Ertuğrul Bey captured the tribe.

1145
02:03:44,594 --> 02:03:47,234
He killed Bahadir Bey and his son
and made the beys kneel.

1146
02:03:47,794 --> 02:03:49,554
Bahadir Bey's alps have surrendered.

1147
02:03:50,394 --> 02:03:51,594
Damn it.

1148
02:03:52,874 --> 02:03:53,994
How could this happen?

1149
02:03:56,434 --> 02:03:58,114
Ertuğrul will head to the castle now.

1150
02:03:59,194 --> 02:04:02,674
We need to close the secret passage
if we're going to defend the castle.

1151
02:04:03,074 --> 02:04:04,634
Everyone to the castle! Now!

1152
02:04:30,234 --> 02:04:31,954
That's the entrance to the secret passage.

1153
02:04:34,234 --> 02:04:36,234
When Ertuğrul Bey arrives, we'll advance.

1154
02:04:39,274 --> 02:04:41,554
We will conquer it tonight, God willing.

1155
02:04:41,994 --> 02:04:43,594
-God willing.
-God willing.

1156
02:04:44,954 --> 02:04:47,714
When Ares finds out I'm not at the castle
he may well suspect something

1157
02:04:48,154 --> 02:04:49,514
and close the entrance.

1158
02:04:50,314 --> 02:04:53,674
Titan could show up at any moment.
We'll ambush him here.

1159
02:04:55,354 --> 02:04:58,994
Let's pray that Ertuğrul Bey is on time.

1160
02:05:11,114 --> 02:05:12,354
According to our laws...

1161
02:05:15,154 --> 02:05:17,834
there is but one punishment for traitors.

1162
02:05:19,594 --> 02:05:20,834
Death.

1163
02:05:21,794 --> 02:05:22,954
This traitor...

1164
02:05:23,634 --> 02:05:26,314
paid the price
of his uncontrollable ambition

1165
02:05:26,874 --> 02:05:28,314
with his life.

1166
02:05:29,154 --> 02:05:30,274
Look at him!

1167
02:05:31,074 --> 02:05:35,114
Whoever breaks our laws and betrays us...

1168
02:05:36,234 --> 02:05:40,394
for his own benefit
or to satisfy his ambition...

1169
02:05:41,914 --> 02:05:45,834
ends up with his head on my sword.

1170
02:06:06,034 --> 02:06:08,154
-My Bey.
-Brother.

1171
02:06:16,274 --> 02:06:19,234
-May God bless you, my Bey.
-Thank you, Turgut.

1172
02:06:20,274 --> 02:06:23,714
God bless you, Ertuğrul Bey.
You were truly sent from God.

1173
02:06:24,034 --> 02:06:26,874
You saved my tribe from the traitors.
Thank you.

1174
02:06:27,114 --> 02:06:28,354
You're welcome, Aslıhan Hatun.

1175
02:06:57,034 --> 02:06:58,874
Until it had a knife through it,

1176
02:06:59,114 --> 02:07:01,354
her treacherous heart would
always have been a problem.

1177
02:07:10,434 --> 02:07:13,314
Now, leadership is yours, Turgut Bey.

1178
02:07:15,634 --> 02:07:18,394
From now on, my tribe is yours to command.

1179
02:07:22,634 --> 02:07:23,794
But my Bey...

1180
02:07:48,074 --> 02:07:49,274
Henceforth,

1181
02:07:50,354 --> 02:07:52,114
the Cavdar tribe is led

1182
02:07:52,634 --> 02:07:53,914
by Turgut Bey.

1183
02:07:54,954 --> 02:07:55,994
Obey him!

1184
02:08:03,514 --> 02:08:06,634
By agreeing to obey, don't think
you've got away with what you've done.

1185
02:08:07,634 --> 02:08:10,154
There is still a price
to pay for your actions.

1186
02:08:11,714 --> 02:08:13,314
Verdicts...

1187
02:08:15,274 --> 02:08:17,354
will be reached after
the battle, Turgut Bey.

1188
02:08:19,754 --> 02:08:20,874
As you command, my Bey.

1189
02:08:24,714 --> 02:08:26,834
If no traitors are left among us,

1190
02:08:27,434 --> 02:08:31,954
the thousand bastards who wait outside
stand no chance of defeating us.

1191
02:08:34,074 --> 02:08:35,514
We took the head of the traitor.

1192
02:08:36,994 --> 02:08:40,554
Now it is time for us
to take the head of our enemy.

1193
