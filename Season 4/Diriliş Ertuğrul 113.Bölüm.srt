1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 113 will start after 12:09 min.

2
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:32,875
That's for what you did to
Ertuğrul Bey and my tribe.

3
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:48,795
Die, Sadettin. Die so that
the world can be a better place.

4
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,555
Kayraldi!

5
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,315
Kayraldi!

6
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,875
Kayraldi.

7
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:43,635
How many more beys will die because
of your loyalty to Sadettin, Günalp Bey?

8
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:47,595
I'll never give up the state
to jackals like you, Ertuğrul Bey.

9
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:24,035
Günalp Bey!

10
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,035
Daughter, did you find any trace of her?

11
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:47,115
No, Mother.
Her saddlebag is missing.

12
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:49,195
It looks like she took it.

13
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:54,435
Wasn't Aliyar Bey's sword here?

14
00:17:58,515 --> 00:17:59,515
It was here.

15
00:18:01,715 --> 00:18:02,875
She took that too.

16
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:11,995
My God, may you protect her.

17
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,835
It's obvious what's she's gone to do.

18
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:18,595
Her intention is clear.

19
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:25,755
Artuk Bey.

20
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:28,875
-We've had news from the alps.
-Have they seen Aslihan Hatun?

21
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:32,395
A shepherd says he saw a woman
riding towards Konya.

22
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,035
Was she alone?

23
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:36,515
She was, my Bey.
She was riding a black horse.

24
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:39,555
That's Aslihan Hatun's horse.

25
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:43,315
You were right, Halime Hatun.

26
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,755
What if Aslihan gets into the palace?

27
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:51,675
What if Emir Sadettin
does something to her?

28
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:56,595
Abdurrahman, send the alps after
Aslihan Hatun, right away.

29
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,395
They have to catch up with her
before something happens.

30
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:01,195
Yes, my Bey.

31
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:10,635
Let's pray that the alps reach Aslihan.

32
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:14,195
Aslihan Hatun, no.

33
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:07,075
Kayraldi.

34
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:23,835
No one can save you from me, Sadettin.

35
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:25,355
No one.

36
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:27,355
Don't do it, Aslihan.

37
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,075
The price will be heavy.

38
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:35,075
So much blood will be
shed in your tribe.

39
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:41,235
You'll cause your own death
and that of your people.

40
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,675
I'm warning you for the last time.

41
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:50,155
Don't do it.

42
00:20:50,995 --> 00:20:51,995
Aslihan!

43
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:04,195
My tribe was split apart because of you.

44
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:17,235
It betrayed... my brother...
and Ertuğrul Bey.

45
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,355
But if you...

46
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:35,115
If you die...

47
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,035
my tribe will be saved.

48
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:41,195
As will the people I love.

49
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:48,475
You'll die, Sadettin.

50
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:58,835
You can't take the ones
I love away from me anymore.

51
00:22:00,995 --> 00:22:02,595
I won't let you do it.

52
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:04,635
I won't.

53
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:12,675
Die, Sadettin. Die.

54
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:29,435
Don't do it.

55
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,475
Kayraldi.

56
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:16,315
Aslihan.

57
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:21,035
As...

58
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:39,355
Aslihan.

59
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,275
<i>Eşhedü en lâ</i>

60
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,435
<i>ilâhe</i>

61
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:48,035
<i>illallâh.</i>

62
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:50,795
<i>Ve eşhedü enne</i>

63
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:51,955
<i>Muhammeden</i>

64
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:53,675
<i>abduhu ve Resuluh.</i>

65
00:23:56,595 --> 00:23:57,715
Aslihan.

66
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:27,115
Aslihan.

67
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:43,635
Aslihan.

68
00:26:16,435 --> 00:26:18,355
I've got you, my brave men.

69
00:26:56,035 --> 00:26:59,155
-Who are they?
-My uncle, Garkin Bey.

70
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,235
Stop the archers!

71
00:27:15,195 --> 00:27:16,195
Stop.

72
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:19,355
Archers, stop.

73
00:27:43,915 --> 00:27:45,555
May I enter, Your Eminence?

74
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:49,355
Your Eminence?

75
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:52,675
Your Eminence.

76
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:03,715
Your Eminence. Your Eminence!

77
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:06,035
Aslihan.

78
00:28:09,795 --> 00:28:12,555
You'll live, your Eminence. You'll live.

79
00:28:12,915 --> 00:28:14,755
Soldier! Soldier!

80
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:20,355
I'll get you out of here.
Call the doctor, quick!

81
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:29,155
Your Eminence.

82
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:30,995
Kayraldi.

83
00:28:32,915 --> 00:28:34,675
Take Aslihan to her tribe.

84
00:28:40,515 --> 00:28:42,995
Everyone should know that I killed her.

85
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:46,795
Don't exhaust yourself, Eminence.
I'll get you out of here.

86
00:28:48,955 --> 00:28:49,955
Do as I say.

87
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,955
Send Aslihan to her tribe.

88
00:29:01,395 --> 00:29:05,275
Make sure Turgut and Ertuğrul
know that I killed her.

89
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:10,875
That's an order, Kayraldi.

90
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:14,915
I will, Eminence.
I'll have her body sent to her tribe.

91
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,275
It's you I'm concerned about.

92
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:25,195
Your Eminence. Your Eminence!

93
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:27,275
Your Eminence.

94
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:29,475
Your Eminence.

95
00:29:33,235 --> 00:29:34,515
Your Eminence!

96
00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:51,795
Günalp Bey. Don't let
any more soldiers get hurt.

97
00:29:57,835 --> 00:29:59,955
We'll settle this here.

98
00:30:01,715 --> 00:30:03,635
Let's not spill any more blood.

99
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:06,555
Let's do it, Ertuğrul Bey.

100
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:13,195
Surrender, Günalp Bey.
Don't be so stubborn.

101
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:18,595
Your loyalty to Emir Sadettin
has cost many beys their lives.

102
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:21,635
End this now.

103
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:27,235
I'd rather die than to surrender
to a traitor like you, Ertuğrul Bey.

104
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:52,115
You're such a smart woman, Marya.

105
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:56,915
First you betrayed me.

106
00:30:58,795 --> 00:30:59,995
And then the Turks.

107
00:31:04,675 --> 00:31:05,715
What will you do now?

108
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:10,275
Betray Governor Kritos?

109
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,035
You killed my brother, Ares.

110
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,595
But Governor Kritos
saved me from the Turks.

111
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,035
Why would I betray him?

112
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:34,395
Besides, I didn't betray you.

113
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:38,275
You merely paid for my brother's death.

114
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:40,675
Yes, I killed your brother.

115
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:44,755
But what about the Turks?

116
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:47,675
What did they do?

117
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,635
Ertuğrul took care of you.

118
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:55,795
The Turks let you live among them.

119
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:59,395
They married you to Artuk Bey.

120
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:01,595
So why betray them?

121
00:32:04,795 --> 00:32:07,635
I... never liked them.

122
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,835
I took shelter there because
I had no other choice.

123
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:18,635
If I wanted to stay there I had
to get married, so I got married.

124
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:24,115
Such a sad story, Marya.

125
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:29,715
But like always,
it's not even close to the truth.

126
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:33,715
Let's stop talking about this.

127
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:39,115
We meet here once again under
the same roof, with the same purpose.

128
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:40,995
Destroying Ertuğrul.

129
00:32:44,035 --> 00:32:46,115
But I'll keep an eye on you, Marya.

130
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:47,875
If I see a mistake...

131
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:51,555
be sure that... I won't pity you.

132
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:09,235
Burn in hell, Ares.

133
00:33:12,555 --> 00:33:13,555
{\an8}Burn in hell.

134
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,026
The beys at the council
were going to rebel against Sadettin.

135
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:21,626
But...

136
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:25,786
when they realized they risked
destroying the state, they stood down.

137
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:29,986
And it was you who persuaded
them, Ertuğrul Bey, right?

138
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:34,266
Are you ever going to stop lying to me?

139
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:40,346
You saw your death was imminent,
and now you're trying to save yourself.

140
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:42,866
You have killed many innocents.

141
00:33:43,986 --> 00:33:48,426
That's why you'll pay
for your crimes, now and in the afterlife.

142
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:54,546
You'll die as
Sadettin's dog and as a murderer.

143
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:11,666
Then die, Ertuğrul Bey.

144
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:43,946
Stop!

145
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:45,866
Kneel.

146
00:34:46,786 --> 00:34:47,946
He's won for now.

147
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:53,666
You promised, Ertuğrul Bey. Let my men go.

148
00:34:56,826 --> 00:34:57,826
Alps!

149
00:35:00,106 --> 00:35:01,106
Let them go.

150
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,066
Go.

151
00:35:16,386 --> 00:35:17,786
That's an order, go!

152
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:36,586
Finish me, Ertuğrul Bey.

153
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:41,746
Emir Sadettin will bring you to account.

154
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:46,786
From the very start...
I believed you meant well.

155
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:51,866
Even though your loyalty has
caused so many deaths...

156
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:55,466
I won't take your life today, Gunalp Bey.

157
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:57,946
You can't leave that murderer alive,
Ertuğrul Bey!

158
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:06,226
Sadettin Köpek will do
anything to see me dead.

159
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:10,866
But as long as you're the Frontier Bey

160
00:36:11,746 --> 00:36:16,706
you won't harm Karacahisar or my tribe
because you're an honorable man.

161
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:24,106
Our fight is not with the state,

162
00:36:24,746 --> 00:36:26,426
but with that dog, Sadettin Köpek.

163
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:31,666
So, if that dog has a problem,
he can come see me.

164
00:36:34,186 --> 00:36:36,466
I'm going to release you now, Gunalp Bey.

165
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:41,466
May you live long enough to see the truth.

166
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:43,986
Go now.

167
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:57,866
This isn't over, Ertuğrul Bey.
We shall meet again.

168
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:55,426
May I come in, Mahperi Hatun?

169
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:56,946
Come in.

170
00:37:58,426 --> 00:37:59,426
Mahperi Hatun.

171
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,146
What's happened?

172
00:38:03,306 --> 00:38:05,266
An attempt has been made
on Emir Sadettin's life.

173
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:11,226
What? Who?

174
00:38:12,146 --> 00:38:14,146
Who dared do this?

175
00:38:14,306 --> 00:38:15,266
A woman.

176
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:17,786
What woman?

177
00:38:18,386 --> 00:38:19,466
We don't know who.

178
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:22,986
And Emir Sadettin?

179
00:38:23,226 --> 00:38:24,506
I'm told he's badly injured.

180
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:29,506
Where is he now?

181
00:38:30,906 --> 00:38:32,706
-I don't know.
-He must be in his room.

182
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:46,706
This is a gift from God, Abdullah.

183
00:38:47,946 --> 00:38:52,026
You can kill him while
he lies helpless in his room.

184
00:38:52,906 --> 00:38:54,706
The state depends on it.

185
00:38:55,106 --> 00:38:58,666
I'd gladly give my life for our state
and our Sultan, Mahperi Hatun.

186
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:31,986
Come in, Ares, come in.

187
00:39:36,546 --> 00:39:37,906
You sent for me, Kritos.

188
00:39:40,186 --> 00:39:42,546
I have an important mission for you.

189
00:39:42,986 --> 00:39:47,146
An important mission for me? What is it?

190
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:59,626
-You are to go to Nicaea.
-Nicaea? Why?

191
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:04,786
To take this letter to the Emperor.

192
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:10,706
We'll need an army if we're going
to stop Ertuğrul settling in Sogut.

193
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:15,346
I've explained everything
to the Emperor in the letter.

194
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:19,946
Emir Sadettin is going to kill Ertuğrul
anyway. Why do we need an army?

195
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:23,026
It's not just for Ertuğrul.

196
00:40:24,026 --> 00:40:29,546
when Emir Sadettin leaves for Samsat
we'll move in and take back Karacahisar.

197
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:35,226
I hope the Emperor agrees to send an army.

198
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:36,866
He will, Ares.

199
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:43,386
He has to if he wants
Sogut and Karacahisar back.

200
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,106
You will return here
at the head of that army.

201
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:54,106
-I'll get on the road.
-Go, Ares.

202
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,786
Don't forget,

203
00:40:55,946 --> 00:41:00,506
this army will grant all of us
the vengeance we seek from Ertuğrul.

204
00:41:41,386 --> 00:41:42,946
How did you find us, Garkin Bey?

205
00:41:43,546 --> 00:41:46,306
We caught the dog who told Emir Sadettin
about the council.

206
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:51,386
I was sure he'd send
his men here to ambush you,

207
00:41:52,146 --> 00:41:53,226
so I came.

208
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:58,306
I meant to warn you, but I was too late.

209
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:02,226
We lost many brave beys and alps.

210
00:42:04,346 --> 00:42:09,266
Garkin Bey, move your tribes
as soon as possible.

211
00:42:11,026 --> 00:42:12,746
Leave no trace.

212
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,706
Otherwise Emir Sadettin...

213
00:42:20,066 --> 00:42:23,146
will send his men to kill them,
even the children.

214
00:42:24,546 --> 00:42:27,746
We have to tell the tribes
who have lost their beys.

215
00:42:28,706 --> 00:42:30,586
They will also need to protect themselves.

216
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:31,986
Ertuğrul Bey,

217
00:42:32,706 --> 00:42:36,546
Sadettin Köpek has killed many
to satisfy his ambition.

218
00:42:37,106 --> 00:42:38,466
He has destroyed many beys.

219
00:42:38,946 --> 00:42:42,906
I would have preferred you to have
killed Gunalp as well, Ertuğrul Bey.

220
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:47,426
Killing him wouldn't
have achieved anything.

221
00:42:51,626 --> 00:42:55,746
His intentions are good.
His eyes will open soon.

222
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,026
Our target...

223
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,186
is Sadettin Köpek.

224
00:43:06,546 --> 00:43:07,546
Many beys died.

225
00:43:09,146 --> 00:43:11,026
But there was no rebellion.

226
00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:14,506
There was no war between
our state and our tribes.

227
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:22,826
Unfortunately, our great state will
belong to Sadettin Köpek soon.

228
00:43:23,026 --> 00:43:24,546
It won't, Garkin Bey.

229
00:43:25,546 --> 00:43:28,346
We will never let that happen,
even if it means our deaths.

230
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:35,466
When the time comes
I'll kill Emir Sadettin.

231
00:43:39,146 --> 00:43:40,146
Ertuğrul Bey.

232
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:44,146
No one doubts your bravery or dedication.

233
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,146
We all know you'll fight to the very end.

234
00:43:47,906 --> 00:43:50,466
But what if Köpek doesn't die?

235
00:43:51,786 --> 00:43:54,906
Then there will be nothing wrong
in rebelling, Garkin Bey.

236
00:43:55,986 --> 00:43:56,986
But,

237
00:43:57,626 --> 00:44:02,186
unless there's no other choice left to us,
we must not rebel against the state.

238
00:44:04,026 --> 00:44:05,506
If you don't kill him,

239
00:44:06,506 --> 00:44:09,946
Sadettin Köpek will punish
the Turkish tribes severely.

240
00:44:11,466 --> 00:44:15,186
The tribes must go up into the mountains.

241
00:44:17,186 --> 00:44:21,306
Afterwards,
anyone who can hold a sword will rebel.

242
00:44:23,706 --> 00:44:27,346
Until the state is saved
we'll all have to live as fugitives.

243
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:32,906
Until the state is saved from Köpek

244
00:44:33,866 --> 00:44:36,866
we can't return to our tribes or tents.

245
00:44:37,586 --> 00:44:41,866
We'll travel,
no matter the distance or the weather.

246
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:45,946
It may be that we never return home.

247
00:44:49,346 --> 00:44:52,826
We'll consider everything
if it means finishing this.

248
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:58,746
We'll go at dawn. May God help us all.

249
00:44:59,586 --> 00:45:01,946
-Amen.
-Hard times await.

250
00:45:05,426 --> 00:45:07,186
We have to endure

251
00:45:08,346 --> 00:45:11,186
and overcome days like these.

252
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:14,986
We can accept suffering.

253
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:20,466
If each one of us is patient,
we'll find peace in the end.

254
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:26,306
We do this for our state and our country.

255
00:45:41,026 --> 00:45:45,066
Emir Sadettin won't leave his room alive.
We'll finish it quickly.

256
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:48,106
Then we dispose of all
the soldiers loyal to him.

257
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:52,786
There will be much blood spilled tonight.
But the state will be cleansed.

258
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:15,066
How dare you enter Emir Sadettin's
chambers without permission?

259
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:16,346
Where is Emir Sadettin?

260
00:46:17,386 --> 00:46:20,346
His Eminence is leading his army to war.

261
00:46:22,226 --> 00:46:23,706
Now, leave immediately.

262
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:27,346
You're lying.

263
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:30,666
Someone tried to kill Emir Sadettin,
where is he?

264
00:46:30,906 --> 00:46:32,426
What is this nonsense?

265
00:46:32,746 --> 00:46:35,506
So, you won't tell us where he went.

266
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,786
Then you'll answer for
this blood on the floor.

267
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,506
Arrest him.

268
00:46:40,786 --> 00:46:43,146
Let me go, what do you think you're doing?

269
00:46:43,306 --> 00:46:44,786
Let go of me! Let go!

270
00:47:16,146 --> 00:47:19,906
<i>Sadettin, it's time to pay.</i>

271
00:47:20,706 --> 00:47:24,626
Thankfully, we're not afraid of death.

272
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:29,306
<i>Know that I'll never let you get away</i>

273
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,826
and that no matter how heavy my chains,

274
00:47:33,106 --> 00:47:34,826
they will never protect you from me.

275
00:47:37,786 --> 00:47:41,426
Die, Sadettin. Die,
so that the world might be a better place.

276
00:48:08,346 --> 00:48:09,346
Your Eminence.

277
00:48:10,746 --> 00:48:11,866
Aslıhan!

278
00:48:12,186 --> 00:48:14,266
Your Eminence, the woman is dead.

279
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:21,786
You'll be fine.
Your Eminence, you will be fine.

280
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:25,146
-Aslıhan.
-You'll be fine, Your Eminence.

281
00:48:25,786 --> 00:48:26,786
You'll be fine.

282
00:48:33,386 --> 00:48:35,786
Kayraldi, Kayraldi.

283
00:48:39,426 --> 00:48:40,546
Where am I?

284
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:44,906
The Caravansary, sir.

285
00:48:47,066 --> 00:48:49,826
I feared for your life,
so I brought you here.

286
00:48:52,786 --> 00:48:54,626
Do they know where I am?

287
00:48:57,266 --> 00:48:58,386
No, Your Eminence.

288
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:03,386
I brought you here in secret.

289
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:08,186
Good.

290
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:16,066
You'll be awarded ten-fold
for your quick-thinking.

291
00:49:17,906 --> 00:49:20,746
If... If I had stayed in the palace...

292
00:49:25,506 --> 00:49:29,706
Mahperi Hatun would have tried to kill me.

293
00:49:30,826 --> 00:49:33,546
You're safe, Your Eminence. Rest now.

294
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:49,786
Wait!

295
00:49:52,066 --> 00:49:54,586
Did you send Aslıhan's body to her tribe?

296
00:49:56,906 --> 00:49:59,226
I did, as per your order, Your Eminence.

297
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:11,666
Her corpse will give me
Ertuğrul and Turgut.

298
00:50:19,706 --> 00:50:21,186
Your army is ready for you.

299
00:50:21,466 --> 00:50:24,866
We'll set off when you've
recovered your strength

300
00:51:12,146 --> 00:51:14,786
-May I enter, Mahperi Hatun?
-Come in.

301
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:21,346
What happened, Abdullah? Is he dead?

302
00:51:21,506 --> 00:51:23,266
There was only a soldier there.

303
00:51:25,146 --> 00:51:27,426
Damn it. Where is he then?

304
00:51:27,866 --> 00:51:29,866
The soldier said he went
to war with his army.

305
00:51:31,186 --> 00:51:32,106
How?

306
00:51:34,146 --> 00:51:37,386
How did this happen? Were we lied to?

307
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,666
I don't think so.

308
00:51:41,066 --> 00:51:43,106
-Why not?
-There was blood on the floor.

309
00:51:46,026 --> 00:51:47,946
Then we did hear the truth.

310
00:51:49,546 --> 00:51:52,866
A woman tried to kill Sadettin,
but she died instead.

311
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:56,426
Sadettin was taken away secretly.

312
00:51:57,066 --> 00:52:01,146
He must have fled in secret
because he knew what awaited him.

313
00:52:04,026 --> 00:52:05,946
His army waits for him to go to Samsat.

314
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:08,946
Despicable man.

315
00:52:09,986 --> 00:52:11,866
So, he managed to save himself.

316
00:52:13,906 --> 00:52:15,666
Find out who the woman was.

317
00:52:16,106 --> 00:52:17,386
As you command, Mahperi Hatun.

318
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:19,346
When is the Sultan to return?

319
00:52:19,786 --> 00:52:20,666
We don't know.

320
00:52:33,546 --> 00:52:35,146
Whose hunt is this, Giyaseddin?

321
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:37,666
Whose hunt?

322
00:53:56,186 --> 00:53:57,266
Let him come.

323
00:54:16,826 --> 00:54:17,826
My Sultan.

324
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:20,466
Soldiers!

325
00:54:27,506 --> 00:54:29,106
Emir of Sivas, Husamettin Karaca.

326
00:54:29,946 --> 00:54:30,946
Welcome.

327
00:54:32,346 --> 00:54:34,706
-You look well.
-Thanks to you, my Sultan.

328
00:54:35,506 --> 00:54:36,626
Who knows you're here?

329
00:54:37,466 --> 00:54:38,826
Nobody knows.

330
00:54:39,546 --> 00:54:42,466
You know,
not even the roads recognized me.

331
00:54:43,506 --> 00:54:44,626
I know, I know.

332
00:54:47,346 --> 00:54:49,306
I called you here for something important.

333
00:54:51,586 --> 00:54:52,586
Tell me, my Sultan.

334
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:56,346
The state is going
through difficult times.

335
00:54:58,026 --> 00:55:00,026
There's a snake around our neck.

336
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:03,106
Suffocating us more every day.

337
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:08,786
We have to take its head
if we are to breathe again.

338
00:55:10,346 --> 00:55:11,946
Emir Sadettin Köpek, right?

339
00:55:12,626 --> 00:55:13,906
Emir Sadettin Köpek.

340
00:55:17,586 --> 00:55:19,666
He's needed to die for a long time now.

341
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:25,666
His existence threatens
both the state and your rule, my Sultan.

342
00:55:27,906 --> 00:55:33,426
Thank God, the soul of Sultan
Alaeddin Kayqubad will find peace.

343
00:55:35,026 --> 00:55:37,946
You'll make clear you're worthy of him.

344
00:55:38,706 --> 00:55:40,746
Someone else is to join you
on this mission.

345
00:55:41,906 --> 00:55:44,786
You can accomplish it only with him.

346
00:55:45,826 --> 00:55:46,826
Who, my Sultan?

347
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:49,386
Ertuğrul Bey.

348
00:55:58,866 --> 00:56:00,866
-Ertuğrul Bey.
-Welcome, Ahmet.

349
00:56:02,746 --> 00:56:04,866
-Thank you, my Bey.
-Come.

350
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:12,346
What news, Ahmet?

351
00:56:12,546 --> 00:56:16,866
My Bey, Governor Kritos
wants me to go to Nicaea.

352
00:56:18,466 --> 00:56:19,466
Interesting.

353
00:56:20,706 --> 00:56:24,306
I'm to demand an army
from the emperor for Governor Kritos.

354
00:56:26,026 --> 00:56:28,386
He wants me to lead that army here.

355
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:33,946
He'll do anything to keep Sogut.

356
00:56:34,906 --> 00:56:36,506
It's not only Sogut, my Bey.

357
00:56:38,466 --> 00:56:42,226
He wants to take back Karacahisar as well,
now that Sadettin Köpek is gone.

358
00:56:44,386 --> 00:56:46,866
What about you, what will you do?

359
00:56:50,186 --> 00:56:55,586
Before settling in Sogut,
I'll have taken Sadettin Köpek's head.

360
00:56:56,466 --> 00:56:57,466
My Bey...

361
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,866
They'll execute you
if they get hold of you.

362
00:57:02,746 --> 00:57:04,106
Tread carefully.

363
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:08,026
Don't worry, Ahmet.

364
00:57:11,946 --> 00:57:12,946
Go.

365
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:17,146
Go and take charge of the emperor's army.

366
00:57:17,946 --> 00:57:21,466
Take charge of that army so that
we may then command it.

367
00:57:23,186 --> 00:57:28,986
To follow this path we have risked all
kinds of torture, torment and suffering.

368
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,906
Don't worry us now.

369
00:57:35,866 --> 00:57:38,306
The tyrant might hold the noose...

370
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,746
but we hold the sword of justice.

371
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,706
God help you, Ertuğrul Bey.

372
00:57:46,226 --> 00:57:47,986
God help us all, Ahmet.

373
00:57:48,746 --> 00:57:50,106
-Amen.
-Amen.

374
00:57:50,826 --> 00:57:51,826
My Bey,

375
00:57:51,906 --> 00:57:56,586
that bastard Sadettin will do everything
in his power to catch us.

376
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,746
Then we'll do everything in our power

377
00:57:59,826 --> 00:58:02,706
not to get caught until
our mission is over, Bamsı.

378
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,546
All right, my Bey. All right.

379
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:07,866
Köpek holds the state.

380
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:13,746
We will endure anything until
we can cut off his hand.

381
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:21,266
Let's get back to the tribe...
and tell everyone what we intend to do.

382
00:58:22,626 --> 00:58:25,066
It'll give us a chance
to say our farewells to our loved ones.

383
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:36,066
Henceforth, you are to forget
about your tribe, your tent and your bed.

384
00:58:37,466 --> 00:58:41,906
Until Emir Sadettin is dead
we will have no peace.

385
00:58:43,346 --> 00:58:47,186
Either Sadettin Köpek will die
and we will have saved the state

386
00:58:48,146 --> 00:58:51,386
or we will die and the state will fall.

387
00:58:56,026 --> 00:58:57,226
There's no other way.

388
00:58:58,786 --> 00:58:59,866
As you command, my Bey.

389
00:59:00,426 --> 00:59:02,546
-As you command, my Bey.
-As you command, my Bey.

390
00:59:12,546 --> 00:59:14,826
I had a motive for sending
Sadettin to Samsat.

391
00:59:16,426 --> 00:59:20,746
While he's there you can
begin preparations with our loyal emirs.

392
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,586
On his return journey home,
Sadettin will rest in Sivas.

393
00:59:25,426 --> 00:59:28,826
Sadettin Köpek respects me.
He's nervous around me.

394
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,946
When he returns
I'll look to gain his trust further

395
00:59:34,466 --> 00:59:35,466
and trap him.

396
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:37,866
That's exactly what I ask, Husamettin.

397
00:59:38,346 --> 00:59:39,866
Welcome him to Sivas.

398
00:59:40,866 --> 00:59:43,106
Then finish him off
with Ertuğrul Bey's help.

399
00:59:44,386 --> 00:59:51,026
As soon as that jackal meets this wolf,
I'll kill him and send you the body.

400
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:53,506
I'm sure of it.

401
00:59:55,386 --> 00:59:57,226
I have to meet Ertuğrul Bey.

402
00:59:59,066 --> 01:00:00,426
How will he know to trust me?

403
01:00:09,866 --> 01:00:11,186
Take this.

404
01:00:11,546 --> 01:00:12,586
It bears my mark.

405
01:00:14,546 --> 01:00:16,106
It's a secret decree.

406
01:00:16,906 --> 01:00:19,906
Show it to Ertuğrul Bey. He'll trust you.

407
01:00:21,506 --> 01:00:22,666
As you command, my Sultan.

408
01:00:24,186 --> 01:00:29,066
Everyone will come to see
who the Sultan is and who rules here.

409
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,586
It's over.

410
01:00:32,706 --> 01:00:35,386
The state is above everything else.

411
01:00:36,186 --> 01:00:40,146
The state rules again.
It's time to purge ourselves of this scum.

412
01:02:14,586 --> 01:02:15,586
You don't exist.

413
01:02:17,826 --> 01:02:18,826
You're dead.

414
01:02:19,506 --> 01:02:21,306
I killed you.

415
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:23,666
You're dead!

416
01:02:28,386 --> 01:02:29,386
What is this?

417
01:02:37,866 --> 01:02:41,066
You... are dead.

418
01:02:45,786 --> 01:02:49,666
<i>Ertuğrul Bey and Turgut</i>
<i>will not let you live.</i>

419
01:02:50,426 --> 01:02:52,626
<i>They will kill you.</i>

420
01:02:55,626 --> 01:02:58,026
They'll never be able to.

421
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:02,066
<i>You're nothing, Sadettin.</i>

422
01:03:02,706 --> 01:03:03,706
I will be...

423
01:03:04,626 --> 01:03:07,906
the Sultan of the Seljuk state.

424
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:13,866
Their corpses will be food for carrion.

425
01:03:15,066 --> 01:03:16,746
<i>You're nothing.</i>

426
01:03:17,506 --> 01:03:23,346
<i>You'll die poor and alone and humiliated.</i>

427
01:03:27,706 --> 01:03:28,706
I am...

428
01:03:30,186 --> 01:03:35,226
the real son of the
late Sultan Keyhusrev.

429
01:03:36,306 --> 01:03:41,386
My mother, Sehnaz Hatun,
gave birth to me to make me sultan.

430
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:47,546
I was brought up an illegitimate child,
that's true.

431
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:49,866
However,

432
01:03:50,546 --> 01:03:55,026
I am the true heir to the Seljuk throne.

433
01:03:56,026 --> 01:03:57,026
You're dead.

434
01:03:58,546 --> 01:04:01,826
Ertuğrul and Turgut will die too.

435
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,346
I'll kill you all until...

436
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:12,186
one by one your line is brought to an end.

437
01:04:14,026 --> 01:04:18,426
<i>No one loves or respects you.</i>

438
01:04:20,386 --> 01:04:21,626
<i>Look around you.</i>

439
01:04:22,266 --> 01:04:25,546
<i>You're alone, Sadettin. All alone.</i>

440
01:04:26,626 --> 01:04:28,746
<i>You say you'll be Sultan.</i>

441
01:04:29,746 --> 01:04:34,586
<i>You're nothing but an illegitimate child</i>
<i>and it will always stay that way.</i>

442
01:04:37,066 --> 01:04:39,506
You... You....

443
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,746
Your Eminence, are you all right?

444
01:04:48,066 --> 01:04:49,066
Come in.

445
01:04:57,866 --> 01:04:58,866
What is it?

446
01:04:59,226 --> 01:05:00,466
Gunalp Bey approaches.

447
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:03,106
Let him come.

448
01:05:03,906 --> 01:05:07,386
I have the letter
Aydogmus sent from Karacahisar.

449
01:05:08,186 --> 01:05:11,066
Good. Marya must have done her job.

450
01:05:30,346 --> 01:05:31,706
What does it say, Your Eminence?

451
01:05:38,946 --> 01:05:42,866
"Governor Kritos has sent
Ares to gather an army."

452
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:49,546
While you're away,
Sogut is to be Ertuğrul's grave.

453
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:03,786
If they can't do it...

454
01:06:05,866 --> 01:06:10,746
when I return from Samsat,
I'll crush the Kayis with my army.

455
01:06:14,466 --> 01:06:15,466
Let Gunalp Bey come.

456
01:07:23,946 --> 01:07:25,106
Your daughter's, brother?

457
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:30,746
Yes. Hers.

458
01:07:35,546 --> 01:07:37,146
I have two children but...

459
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:42,266
I miss my daughter especially, Ertuğrul.

460
01:07:46,906 --> 01:07:47,946
I feel it here.

461
01:07:49,986 --> 01:07:51,386
Daughters are different.

462
01:07:56,546 --> 01:07:58,426
I hope God grants you each one too.

463
01:08:00,266 --> 01:08:01,266
Amen.

464
01:08:05,106 --> 01:08:07,706
Our Prophet fathered four daughters.

465
01:08:10,826 --> 01:08:13,266
They were special to him.

466
01:08:16,106 --> 01:08:20,386
In a hadith he said,
"Treat your children equally.

467
01:08:21,466 --> 01:08:26,706
But if you do treat them differently,
treat the daughters better."

468
01:08:32,026 --> 01:08:35,626
I hope both my Bey
and I will have daughters.

469
01:08:36,866 --> 01:08:37,866
God willing.

470
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:42,866
Brother Turgut.

471
01:08:44,226 --> 01:08:49,066
You're always the uncle.
Time to be a father.

472
01:08:52,266 --> 01:08:53,266
I hope

473
01:08:54,306 --> 01:08:58,106
you and Aslıhan Hatun
will have babies too.

474
01:09:01,906 --> 01:09:03,506
God willing, brother. God willing.

475
01:09:05,466 --> 01:09:07,626
Let's take care of these problems first.

476
01:09:08,786 --> 01:09:09,786
Then that can happen.

477
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:11,546
God willing.

478
01:09:13,346 --> 01:09:17,386
Aslıhan Hatun has endured a lot.

479
01:09:18,546 --> 01:09:19,826
She's very brave.

480
01:09:21,306 --> 01:09:24,506
Without her determination, the Cavdars
wouldn't have survived this long.

481
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,746
You have a happy home too.

482
01:09:29,706 --> 01:09:31,546
I'm happy for you, Turgut.

483
01:09:33,146 --> 01:09:35,026
Thank you, my Bey. Thank you.

484
01:09:37,186 --> 01:09:38,466
I love her...

485
01:09:40,946 --> 01:09:42,506
May God love her too.

486
01:09:43,026 --> 01:09:44,026
Amen.

487
01:09:44,546 --> 01:09:47,466
As you said,
she has been through so much.

488
01:09:49,106 --> 01:09:50,506
She's never known good fortune.

489
01:09:52,706 --> 01:09:56,506
Now you've been separated again.
It will be hard.

490
01:10:01,186 --> 01:10:03,066
You're right, my Bey. You're right.

491
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:08,826
But she'll endure it again.

492
01:10:09,626 --> 01:10:14,946
It will all be worth it
when I reach home and see her.

493
01:10:24,946 --> 01:10:26,106
May I enter?

494
01:10:26,586 --> 01:10:27,746
Come in, Gunalp.

495
01:10:39,266 --> 01:10:43,266
-Your Eminence. Who did this?
-A woman.

496
01:10:44,946 --> 01:10:46,266
Sent by Ertuğrul.

497
01:10:48,586 --> 01:10:51,586
What sort of man sends a woman

498
01:10:51,826 --> 01:10:56,266
to kill me, when he couldn't
manage it himself?

499
01:10:56,826 --> 01:10:57,826
Ertuğrul?

500
01:11:00,946 --> 01:11:03,266
So, when he was organizing
a rebellion of traitors

501
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:07,266
he also sent an assassin?

502
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,426
He did meet the rebels,
but I killed all of them.

503
01:11:12,146 --> 01:11:17,226
But Ertuğrul Bey, along with Garkin Bey
and his nephew Kutlu Bey, escaped.

504
01:11:22,986 --> 01:11:24,506
Son, get me some water.

505
01:11:49,146 --> 01:11:53,786
I was attacked when I was preparing
to leave for the Samsat campaign.

506
01:11:54,746 --> 01:11:55,626
Devil.

507
01:11:58,186 --> 01:12:00,266
He's a traitor who would kill an Emir

508
01:12:00,346 --> 01:12:02,306
who was preparing
to give his life for his state.

509
01:12:02,946 --> 01:12:05,746
It's nothing, Gunalp, nothing.

510
01:12:07,546 --> 01:12:12,306
Until he's dead,
who knows what else he might do?

511
01:12:19,986 --> 01:12:21,226
Gunalp...

512
01:12:22,426 --> 01:12:25,546
I don't want problems here
while I'm away at war.

513
01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:30,586
Don't worry, Your Eminence. I'll find him.

514
01:12:31,546 --> 01:12:32,426
Good.

515
01:12:34,826 --> 01:12:37,106
I can tell you where he'll be.

516
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:40,866
He knows he's a fugitive now.

517
01:12:43,946 --> 01:12:48,026
He'll go to his tribe
to say his farewells.

518
01:12:50,826 --> 01:12:53,626
Then he'll set out to kill me.

519
01:12:55,706 --> 01:12:59,866
He'll have his brother,
Sungurtekin, with him

520
01:13:00,386 --> 01:13:04,026
and those savages, Turgut and Bamsı.

521
01:13:06,026 --> 01:13:08,466
But when they reach their tribe

522
01:13:09,186 --> 01:13:13,586
they'll find the body
of the woman they sent to kill me.

523
01:13:15,586 --> 01:13:17,346
Don't give them a chance.

524
01:13:18,346 --> 01:13:20,506
Find them. Kill them.

525
01:13:22,866 --> 01:13:23,866
Gunalp.

526
01:13:26,146 --> 01:13:30,186
Show no mercy to anyone in his tribe.

527
01:13:36,906 --> 01:13:39,226
-I'll do what you ask.
-Good.

528
01:13:41,146 --> 01:13:42,346
Your Eminence...

529
01:13:45,066 --> 01:13:46,986
Ertuğrul Bey had his chance to kill me.

530
01:13:49,146 --> 01:13:50,186
Why am I still alive?

531
01:13:52,826 --> 01:13:54,906
I'm going mad thinking about it.

532
01:14:05,386 --> 01:14:06,386
Gunalp

533
01:14:07,746 --> 01:14:11,866
He did that so that
you wouldn't harm his tribe.

534
01:14:14,626 --> 01:14:19,346
Don't... Don't be fooled by his tricks.

535
01:14:25,186 --> 01:14:26,786
Go do your duty.

536
01:14:33,026 --> 01:14:35,346
Save our state from this bandit.

537
01:14:38,186 --> 01:14:39,346
As you command, Your Eminence.

538
01:15:26,941 --> 01:15:28,381
What's happening?

539
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:32,741
Those drums never
herald good news, Mother.

540
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,221
Mother Hayme, they're bringing a body.

541
01:16:22,461 --> 01:16:24,941
My God, please no.

542
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:28,981
Do not inflict a pain
that we cannot overcome!

543
01:16:30,861 --> 01:16:34,141
God... Is Ertuğrul...

544
01:16:34,981 --> 01:16:37,381
My girl, don't talk nonsense.

545
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:11,581
Whose body have you brought us to bury?

546
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:13,461
The woman who attempted

547
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:15,221
to assassinate His Eminence,
Emir Sadettin,

548
01:17:15,301 --> 01:17:16,221
Aslıhan Hatun.

549
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:27,701
What did you do, sister?

550
01:17:28,901 --> 01:17:31,101
Why did you sacrifice yourself?

551
01:17:38,701 --> 01:17:40,381
Sister Aslıhan.

552
01:17:45,821 --> 01:17:48,021
Soldiers! Let's go!

553
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:06,301
God, may Sadettin Köpek
suffer this pain a thousand-fold!

554
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:10,421
Let's take our Hatun's body!

555
01:18:10,741 --> 01:18:11,781
Come on!

556
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:15,061
Stay away! Stay away! Stay away!

557
01:18:16,101 --> 01:18:18,181
Don't lay a finger on that brave woman!

558
01:18:18,741 --> 01:18:21,541
She's the heroic and selfless Hatun
of the Kayis!

559
01:18:22,461 --> 01:18:24,581
Not of a lot of cowards like you!

560
01:18:24,981 --> 01:18:27,301
Stay away! Stay away!

561
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:30,941
-Alps!
-My dear girl...

562
01:18:31,061 --> 01:18:34,141
Carry Aslıhan Hatun's body to the tent.

563
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:38,621
Stop! Stand back!

564
01:18:42,861 --> 01:18:46,181
This valiant woman
sacrificed herself for us.

565
01:18:48,821 --> 01:18:51,181
We, the women, shall carry her.

566
01:18:53,981 --> 01:18:55,101
Women!

567
01:19:01,421 --> 01:19:03,181
<i>Bismillah</i>. Lift.

568
01:20:01,781 --> 01:20:02,861
Aslıhan Hatun.

569
01:20:05,701 --> 01:20:07,501
My dear, brave sister.

570
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:19,581
Mother Hayme.

571
01:20:21,341 --> 01:20:23,381
Ertuğrul Bey and Turgut Bey have arrived.

572
01:20:29,421 --> 01:20:30,541
Artuk Bey.

573
01:20:32,141 --> 01:20:33,861
Look after Turgut.

574
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:05,821
Mother?

575
01:21:14,421 --> 01:21:15,501
Artuk Bey?

576
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:40,821
Who is that?

577
01:23:35,861 --> 01:23:37,101
Aslıhan.

578
01:24:08,181 --> 01:24:10,181
She's sleeping, right?

579
01:24:15,101 --> 01:24:16,181
Mother Hayme?

580
01:24:20,421 --> 01:24:22,301
Mother Hayme, tell me she's asleep.

581
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:31,341
Tell me she'll live.

582
01:24:41,221 --> 01:24:42,221
Artuk Bey.

583
01:24:45,181 --> 01:24:46,981
Artuk Bey, tell me she'll live.

584
01:24:49,181 --> 01:24:50,301
Mother Hayme?

585
01:24:55,981 --> 01:24:58,581
Tell me she'll wake up. Artuk Bey!

586
01:25:10,461 --> 01:25:12,141
Aslıhan... Aslıhan!

587
01:25:12,741 --> 01:25:16,181
-Aslıhan! Aslıhan, wake up!
-Brother...

588
01:25:16,581 --> 01:25:18,901
-Aslıhan, Aslıhan...
-Brother...

589
01:25:19,181 --> 01:25:20,621
-My brave brother.
-Brother.

590
01:25:20,701 --> 01:25:22,021
-Son.
-Brother.

591
01:25:22,101 --> 01:25:23,221
Son.

592
01:25:23,301 --> 01:25:25,301
-Brother.
-Turgut Bey.

593
01:25:25,701 --> 01:25:26,941
-Son.
-Brother.

594
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:39,381
Aslıhan.

595
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:49,221
How could they? How could they?

596
01:25:55,221 --> 01:25:56,501
Who did this?

597
01:26:01,861 --> 01:26:03,421
Artuk Bey, who did this?

598
01:26:04,541 --> 01:26:06,341
Emir Sadettin Köpek!

599
01:27:47,981 --> 01:27:50,181
I'll take my birth right, Mother.

600
01:27:51,181 --> 01:27:52,581
I'll take the throne, Mother.

601
01:27:55,981 --> 01:27:58,941
I'll be the sultan,
not as an illegitimate child...

602
01:28:01,821 --> 01:28:06,221
but as the rightful heir to the throne.

603
01:28:15,381 --> 01:28:20,981
When I am sultan, I'll avenge the shame
my father brought on us, Mother.

604
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:44,061
The branch... saw the rosebud
had bloomed one morning.

605
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:52,301
The rose... took flight with the wind.

606
01:28:58,741 --> 01:29:01,101
What a treacherous world.

607
01:29:08,621 --> 01:29:10,861
In ten days, a rose

608
01:29:11,941 --> 01:29:17,341
grew, bloomed and died.

609
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:23,861
While you may pity me...

610
01:29:26,181 --> 01:29:28,661
none of my sins frighten me.

611
01:29:30,661 --> 01:29:37,141
When you're with me,
no obstacle frightens me.

612
01:29:41,981 --> 01:29:45,101
May God revive me with a clean face...

613
01:29:51,501 --> 01:29:57,221
Even if my history is full of crimes,

614
01:29:58,381 --> 01:30:00,461
the darkness holds no fear for me.

615
01:31:40,341 --> 01:31:42,341
I'm going to kill that bastard!

616
01:31:43,101 --> 01:31:45,941
I'm going to kill him!
I'm going to destroy his palace!

617
01:31:46,021 --> 01:31:47,581
-Turgut!
-Let go of me!

618
01:31:47,701 --> 01:31:48,781
Brother!

619
01:31:48,861 --> 01:31:51,261
-Brother!
-Let me go! Let me go!

620
01:31:51,581 --> 01:31:56,541
I won't rest until that bastard's head
is hanging from the palace walls!

621
01:31:56,661 --> 01:32:01,421
Turgut Alp! We feel your pain but you
must calm yourself. Please, my Bey!

622
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:03,901
Brother get a hold of yourself!

623
01:32:03,981 --> 01:32:06,141
We have to bury our brave sister first!

624
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:09,501
-Brother Turgut!
-My Turgut! Turgut!

625
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:13,861
Turgut! Come to your senses, brother!
Come to your senses!

626
01:32:14,421 --> 01:32:15,461
Calm down.

627
01:32:27,821 --> 01:32:30,061
Brother, stay with us.

628
01:32:34,901 --> 01:32:37,141
My Bey, please let me go.

629
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:41,061
I'll lose my mind.

630
01:32:44,901 --> 01:32:46,741
I can't just stand here, my Bey.

631
01:32:49,941 --> 01:32:50,821
Turgut...

632
01:32:58,261 --> 01:32:59,981
We need you alive.

633
01:33:03,941 --> 01:33:06,261
You can't avenge her if you're dead.

634
01:33:07,741 --> 01:33:10,301
I can't let you just walk
into that bastard's hands.

635
01:33:11,901 --> 01:33:15,301
Patience and revenge will be ours,

636
01:33:16,461 --> 01:33:20,221
Sadettin Köpek
will have pain and suffering.

637
01:33:25,621 --> 01:33:27,581
Keep a clear head, brother.

638
01:33:29,181 --> 01:33:32,781
That bastard Köpek will die
in such a way,

639
01:33:33,461 --> 01:33:37,781
that no one else will dare come after him!

640
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:44,221
Tomorrow,
after we have buried Aslıhan Hatun,

641
01:33:45,061 --> 01:33:47,901
we set off to kill Sadettin Köpek.

642
01:33:52,781 --> 01:33:55,781
My heart is burning!

643
01:34:05,661 --> 01:34:08,221
I know, brother. I know.

644
01:34:10,021 --> 01:34:11,221
I won't be at peace

645
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:15,061
until I see that fiend drowning...

646
01:34:16,461 --> 01:34:19,821
in his own blood. I won't.

647
01:34:22,501 --> 01:34:25,901
You'll see it.
I swear, brother. You'll see it.

648
01:34:29,701 --> 01:34:31,461
We'll avenge Aslıhan

649
01:34:32,701 --> 01:34:36,421
and all the other innocents
who were wronged by Köpek.

650
01:34:40,301 --> 01:34:41,941
For Aslıhan Hatun

651
01:34:42,501 --> 01:34:46,661
and all the other innocents,
I swear we'll have our revenge!

652
01:34:47,301 --> 01:34:48,581
I swear!

653
01:35:21,421 --> 01:35:23,781
What's the situation
at the Kay tribe, Aydogmus?

654
01:35:24,741 --> 01:35:25,981
They're mourning.

655
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:29,061
They bury Aslıhan Hatun tomorrow.

656
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:33,061
May God forgive her sins.

657
01:35:35,301 --> 01:35:38,621
She was fooled into believing
Ertuğrul's words and sacrificed herself.

658
01:35:39,661 --> 01:35:43,341
Ertuğrul tricked her,
just like he tricked us.

659
01:35:45,661 --> 01:35:50,301
Make sure the soldiers are ready.
We'll set off soon.

660
01:35:50,981 --> 01:35:52,101
Where to, my Bey?

661
01:35:52,501 --> 01:35:55,101
Some of the soldiers will
besiege the Kayi tribe.

662
01:35:55,741 --> 01:35:58,221
I want them to know
we'll allow them no peace.

663
01:35:59,061 --> 01:36:02,221
Ertuğrul, Bamsı, Turgut, Sungur...

664
01:36:02,661 --> 01:36:05,341
they're certain to go there
to say their farewells.

665
01:36:06,141 --> 01:36:09,541
When they find out about Aslıhan,
they'll stay to attend her funeral.

666
01:36:11,341 --> 01:36:14,221
I'll catch them there tomorrow.

667
01:36:17,661 --> 01:36:19,141
As you command, my Bey.

668
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:35,141
<i>I swear I'll punish</i>
<i>all those who betray the state.</i>

669
01:38:20,301 --> 01:38:24,181
My love, the jewel of my heart.

670
01:38:27,181 --> 01:38:29,061
I overcame so much.

671
01:38:30,061 --> 01:38:33,341
I defied death, but...

672
01:38:35,181 --> 01:38:39,861
how can I defy the torment
of your death, Aslıhan?

673
01:38:44,501 --> 01:38:50,301
What should I make of the black
mountains without you?

674
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:58,141
What should I make
of the rivers flowing like blood.

675
01:39:04,661 --> 01:39:07,261
What's this world
without you in it, Aslıhan?

676
01:39:14,421 --> 01:39:16,221
I don't even care...

677
01:39:19,061 --> 01:39:20,461
if the world ends, Aslıhan.

678
01:39:38,701 --> 01:39:40,541
<i>This dagger is for you.</i>

679
01:39:41,461 --> 01:39:43,741
<i>I want you to have it,</i>
<i>if you'll accept it.</i>

680
01:40:02,981 --> 01:40:04,421
This dagger...

681
01:40:06,581 --> 01:40:09,581
will remind me that
someone is waiting for me.

682
01:40:13,101 --> 01:40:17,541
I swear that
that bastard will meet his end...

683
01:40:19,541 --> 01:40:22,861
by the dagger you gave me!

684
01:40:44,741 --> 01:40:46,981
I will avenge you, my brave wife.

685
01:40:52,581 --> 01:40:54,021
I will avenge you.

686
01:41:12,381 --> 01:41:13,581
Aslıhan...

687
01:41:17,101 --> 01:41:19,981
Her death has hurt me deeply, Ertuğrul.

688
01:41:22,581 --> 01:41:27,621
Emir Sadettin spilled Aslıhan's
blood with his own hand.

689
01:41:29,261 --> 01:41:31,261
It pains me greatly.

690
01:41:34,101 --> 01:41:37,821
It pains all of us, Halime. All of us.

691
01:41:40,061 --> 01:41:42,661
God doesn't cause pain
to those who can't bear it.

692
01:41:46,621 --> 01:41:48,941
We'll overcome this.

693
01:42:01,301 --> 01:42:05,541
Halime, I've gone into battle many times.

694
01:42:07,941 --> 01:42:10,621
But the task we now face
will be harder and more arduous

695
01:42:11,581 --> 01:42:12,941
than any of them.

696
01:42:15,181 --> 01:42:20,261
It might last for months... even years.

697
01:42:21,621 --> 01:42:23,341
It might be years before I return.

698
01:42:24,621 --> 01:42:26,581
If I return at all.

699
01:42:27,061 --> 01:42:30,301
God will protect you.
Don't say that, Ertuğrul.

700
01:42:35,021 --> 01:42:36,101
My Halime...

701
01:42:38,061 --> 01:42:39,821
I might rule this tent,

702
01:42:41,421 --> 01:42:43,421
but you feed this tent.

703
01:42:48,301 --> 01:42:52,021
My Savci, my Gündüz...

704
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:02,421
The baby inside you...

705
01:43:04,341 --> 01:43:05,701
are in God's care...

706
01:43:07,421 --> 01:43:08,941
and in your care.

707
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:17,141
If I don't return...

708
01:43:18,181 --> 01:43:21,941
you must be their mother...
and their father.

709
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:27,221
Raise them like my mother raised me.

710
01:43:29,901 --> 01:43:31,941
Put them on my path.

711
01:43:34,941 --> 01:43:38,981
If I were to die tomorrow,
it would be with the hope that my children

712
01:43:39,461 --> 01:43:42,981
will save our land and our state.

713
01:43:48,741 --> 01:43:50,701
Don't worry, Ertuğrul.

714
01:43:51,821 --> 01:43:53,141
Godspeed.

715
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:57,301
We'll wait for you here.

716
01:43:59,021 --> 01:44:01,901
You need think only of doing your duty,

717
01:44:02,301 --> 01:44:05,501
honorably and with courage,
for our greater glory.

718
01:44:09,621 --> 01:44:11,461
If you come back, we will rejoice.

719
01:44:13,101 --> 01:44:14,501
If you fall,

720
01:44:15,341 --> 01:44:19,141
we'll continue to live
with the honor and the pride

721
01:44:19,781 --> 01:44:21,541
you left us with.

722
01:45:06,341 --> 01:45:07,501
My Hafsa.

723
01:45:08,781 --> 01:45:10,461
My Hafsa, my Hafsa.

724
01:45:11,621 --> 01:45:12,741
My Hafsa.

725
01:45:20,421 --> 01:45:22,701
The path ahead of us
is difficult, my Hafsa.

726
01:45:24,701 --> 01:45:26,341
We might not return...

727
01:45:28,261 --> 01:45:29,181
or...

728
01:45:33,421 --> 01:45:35,181
Hafsa, give me your blessing.

729
01:45:40,421 --> 01:45:42,501
Aslıhan Hatun's death...

730
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,501
and being separated from you...

731
01:45:48,741 --> 01:45:50,021
God help you,

732
01:45:50,821 --> 01:45:51,901
and me,

733
01:45:52,541 --> 01:45:54,181
and our baby.

734
01:45:57,181 --> 01:45:59,981
My dear baby, my dear baby!

735
01:46:03,181 --> 01:46:07,221
The mother of my baby,
the one who has my heart.

736
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:11,261
My Hafsa, my Hafsa.

737
01:46:12,181 --> 01:46:14,901
Aslıhan Hatun gave her life

738
01:46:15,221 --> 01:46:17,461
so that we may live ours happily.

739
01:46:19,981 --> 01:46:22,741
We go so that our state and our tribe

740
01:46:23,381 --> 01:46:25,901
may grow stronger and prosper,

741
01:46:26,861 --> 01:46:31,261
and so that its children may
grow and live long and happy lives.

742
01:46:34,101 --> 01:46:35,341
My Hafsa,

743
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:38,741
if no one is prepared to risk their lives,

744
01:46:39,221 --> 01:46:42,741
how can this state and this country
survive and grow strong?

745
01:46:44,221 --> 01:46:47,341
We shall dedicate ourselves to this.

746
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:50,741
You, Hafsa, should be proud!

747
01:46:51,901 --> 01:46:53,261
Take care of yourself...

748
01:46:55,861 --> 01:46:58,581
and of our baby, my Hafsa.

749
01:47:02,301 --> 01:47:04,421
If I don't return...

750
01:47:05,861 --> 01:47:09,981
tell my baby that his father was brave.

751
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:15,421
Tell him that he died for his country.

752
01:47:17,661 --> 01:47:21,901
My Hafsa, don't let him forget me.

753
01:47:23,061 --> 01:47:24,621
Don't forget me either, my Hafsa.

754
01:47:26,781 --> 01:47:32,701
My Hafsa, give me your blessing, my love.

755
01:47:34,501 --> 01:47:35,821
Bamsı...

756
01:47:39,261 --> 01:47:43,821
You have my blessing, my brave husband.

757
01:48:10,461 --> 01:48:14,661
Deaths and farewells hang heavy
on all of us.

758
01:48:18,501 --> 01:48:20,621
We can't return here

759
01:48:21,301 --> 01:48:25,221
until the state and our tribe are safe.

760
01:48:28,661 --> 01:48:30,381
These days will pass.

761
01:48:31,901 --> 01:48:33,101
They will.

762
01:48:36,061 --> 01:48:38,301
Go safely, my sons.

763
01:48:41,861 --> 01:48:48,101
Be worthy of your ancestors' blood
and your mothers' milk.

764
01:48:48,581 --> 01:48:51,221
-Thank you, Mother.
-Thank you, Mother.

765
01:48:55,821 --> 01:49:01,941
I hope Günalp doesn't come here
and try something while you're gone.

766
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:06,981
Günalp wouldn't harm the tribe, Mother.
He's not like that.

767
01:49:08,061 --> 01:49:10,581
Günalp's only weakness
is Emir Sadettin, Mother.

768
01:49:12,821 --> 01:49:16,501
I warned him.
It was the reason I spared his life.

769
01:49:20,901 --> 01:49:23,421
If another man came and took his place,

770
01:49:23,861 --> 01:49:26,021
his first thought would be
to destroy our tribe.

771
01:49:28,581 --> 01:49:30,621
As you say, son.

772
01:49:32,261 --> 01:49:34,581
Mother, Halime.

773
01:49:36,061 --> 01:49:37,661
You must lead the women.

774
01:49:38,581 --> 01:49:39,981
Starting from tomorrow,

775
01:49:40,541 --> 01:49:44,101
the women must be trained and ready
to deal with anything that threatens us.

776
01:49:46,261 --> 01:49:49,861
But act cautiously until we return.

777
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:53,381
-As you command, son.
-As you command, my Bey.

778
01:50:03,501 --> 01:50:04,621
Mother,

779
01:50:06,421 --> 01:50:09,061
we plan to set off very soon.

780
01:50:13,341 --> 01:50:17,741
-Give us your blessings.
-You have them.

781
01:50:32,741 --> 01:50:35,741
-Give me your blessing, Mother.
-You have it, son.

782
01:50:41,061 --> 01:50:42,501
You have it.

783
01:51:27,901 --> 01:51:29,261
This must be Günalp.

784
01:52:19,901 --> 01:52:21,221
Where is Ertuğrul Bey?

785
01:52:21,861 --> 01:52:25,181
He isn't here, Günalp Bey.
You're wasting your time.

786
01:52:26,341 --> 01:52:27,941
Don't lie to me, Artuk Bey.

787
01:52:30,261 --> 01:52:31,341
I know he's here.

788
01:52:31,861 --> 01:52:33,901
I've told you he isn't, Günalp Bey.

789
01:52:38,261 --> 01:52:39,581
What do you mean?

790
01:52:42,061 --> 01:52:44,341
Don't they know Aslıhan Hatun is dead?

791
01:52:48,261 --> 01:52:49,581
What about the funeral?

792
01:52:50,221 --> 01:52:55,021
They do know and they did come.
They took the body to bury it.

793
01:52:55,781 --> 01:52:56,901
What do you mean?

794
01:52:57,181 --> 01:52:59,261
You think Ertuğrul Bey didn't anticipate

795
01:52:59,381 --> 01:53:03,701
exactly what you
and Emir Sadettin would do?

796
01:53:05,381 --> 01:53:06,661
You're so contemptible

797
01:53:06,941 --> 01:53:10,461
you'd take advantage of a funeral
and strike mourners during a cemetery.

798
01:53:15,221 --> 01:53:17,181
{\an8}Ertuğrul Bey knew exactly what you'd do,

799
01:53:17,341 --> 01:53:21,781
{\an8}so he took the body somewhere else,
Günalp Bey.

800
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:41,199
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

801
01:53:53,999 --> 01:53:56,639
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

802
01:54:09,079 --> 01:54:11,279
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

803
01:54:35,919 --> 01:54:38,879
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

804
01:54:39,559 --> 01:54:43,479
<i>Esselamu aleyküm ve rahmetullah.</i>

805
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:48,319
<i>Esselamu aleyküm ve rahmetullah.</i>

806
01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:10,159
While death is a celebration for the dead,
it is a cause of agony and sorrow...

807
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:12,199
for those left behind.

808
01:55:15,079 --> 01:55:18,719
Our pain is deep, our hearts forlorn.

809
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:25,239
But remember, excessive sorrow
and grief will offend God.

810
01:55:31,519 --> 01:55:35,439
Our Prophet showed patience
in the face of loss and pain.

811
01:55:37,279 --> 01:55:40,639
That Prophet, who was sent
to us as a kindness...

812
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:43,599
came into the world an orphan.

813
01:55:44,839 --> 01:55:46,999
When he was just a child
he lost his mother.

814
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:50,799
His grandfather took him and his uncle in.

815
01:55:52,399 --> 01:55:57,159
He lost his partner in life,
our mother, Hatice.

816
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:06,439
He lost his uncle and greatest supporter,
Hamza, in the battle of Uhud.

817
01:56:07,399 --> 01:56:10,479
He buried his children
with his own hands.

818
01:56:11,759 --> 01:56:15,959
His compassionate heart
became somber with this pain.

819
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:20,759
As he was weeping
after the passing of his son Ibrahim...

820
01:56:21,799 --> 01:56:23,639
one of his companions approached.

821
01:56:25,399 --> 01:56:27,999
"Are you crying too, God's messenger?"
he asked.

822
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:32,079
"Did you not forbid us to cry?"

823
01:56:34,439 --> 01:56:36,879
Our Prophet replied,
"I did not forbid crying.

824
01:56:38,439 --> 01:56:41,359
I forbade screaming in agony.

825
01:56:41,519 --> 01:56:47,839
For when the heart is filled with sorrow,
tears fall from the eyes."

826
01:56:49,079 --> 01:56:52,359
That blessed prophet
endured so much suffering.

827
01:56:53,559 --> 01:56:59,279
However, with his fortitude,
he never turned his back on his path.

828
01:57:00,279 --> 01:57:03,079
Knowing that it is God
who gives and who takes away,

829
01:57:03,639 --> 01:57:05,559
he endured all kinds of pain.

830
01:57:07,519 --> 01:57:12,119
Now it falls on us to draw
inspiration from our Prophet,

831
01:57:12,559 --> 01:57:15,679
to submit to the will of God...

832
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:18,159
and bury our grief in our heart.

833
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:24,679
Know that day awaits beyond every night.

834
01:57:25,839 --> 01:57:29,359
If we show patience,
God will lift our burden...

835
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:31,719
and lighten our hearts.

836
01:57:32,879 --> 01:57:36,039
Now you must be as unyielding as bronze...

837
01:57:37,399 --> 01:57:41,679
and as vibrant as a waterfall
which flows thick and fast.

838
01:57:42,759 --> 01:57:47,639
Be so, that neither the enemy
nor the treacherous may think you weak...

839
01:57:48,759 --> 01:57:51,239
and find the courage to attack you.

840
01:58:11,079 --> 01:58:12,479
Where will they bury her?

841
01:58:12,799 --> 01:58:13,759
We don't know.

842
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:19,119
You're lying, Artuk Bey. Ertuğrul is here.

843
01:58:24,039 --> 01:58:29,639
What gives you the right to ride
into our tribe without permission?

844
01:58:29,839 --> 01:58:31,039
Tell me that.

845
01:58:33,559 --> 01:58:36,159
I do as I am told.

846
01:58:37,799 --> 01:58:39,399
I don't need your permission to do it.

847
01:58:40,439 --> 01:58:42,279
This will be the case
until I find Ertuğrul.

848
01:58:46,039 --> 01:58:47,479
Search the camp.

849
01:58:57,439 --> 01:59:01,759
Stand back, Günalp Bey.
Know that you're in over your head.

850
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:04,639
Don't be so impertinent.

851
01:59:05,999 --> 01:59:11,759
No one has ever dared raid this camp
and no one ever will.

852
01:59:25,999 --> 01:59:28,959
A death warrant has been
issued for Ertuğrul Bey.

853
01:59:30,359 --> 01:59:34,679
Don't make this harder.
Tell me where you've hidden him.

854
01:59:36,599 --> 01:59:40,799
Günalp Bey, you think Ertuğrul Bey
such a coward that he would hide?

855
01:59:41,879 --> 01:59:44,159
If he were here,
he would be the first to face you.

856
01:59:45,079 --> 01:59:47,039
If he had to, he'd fight you.

857
01:59:47,399 --> 01:59:50,239
If he had to walk to the gallows,
he'd walk with his head held high.

858
01:59:51,759 --> 01:59:53,159
As if you don't know that.

859
01:59:54,679 --> 01:59:55,959
I'm just doing my duty.

860
01:59:57,359 --> 01:59:59,079
Now, I'm warning you for the last time.

861
02:00:02,279 --> 02:00:03,599
What will you do, Günalp Bey?

862
02:00:05,399 --> 02:00:11,439
Will you put us to the sword like
they did to your mother and father?

863
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:47,359
Look here, Günalp Bey.
Ertuğrul Bey went to punish the traitors.

864
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:52,919
Those traitors have the death
they deserve coming to them.

865
02:00:55,079 --> 02:00:57,279
Don't you share in it too.

866
02:00:58,839 --> 02:01:00,159
You know what's right.

867
02:01:01,479 --> 02:01:04,759
Take your men and leave this place. Go on.

868
02:01:17,959 --> 02:01:19,359
What should we do, my Bey?

869
02:01:27,959 --> 02:01:29,359
Back to the castle.

870
02:01:37,599 --> 02:01:42,039
If Ertuğrul Bey should come here,
if you should get word to him...

871
02:01:43,559 --> 02:01:48,559
with a bird or on the wind, tell him...

872
02:01:49,879 --> 02:01:52,399
I will not stop until he pays
for what he has done.

873
02:02:50,079 --> 02:02:53,919
There's nothing they can do,
God permitting.

874
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:30,919
Greetings, Artuk Bey.

875
02:03:32,239 --> 02:03:33,559
Greetings.

876
02:03:36,279 --> 02:03:40,399
We have things to discuss.
Take me to Ertuğrul Bey, right away.

877
02:03:41,879 --> 02:03:43,199
Who might you be?

878
02:03:43,719 --> 02:03:45,879
Husamettin Karaca, the Emir of Sivas.

879
02:03:47,639 --> 02:03:48,919
Husamettin Karaca?

880
02:04:35,839 --> 02:04:37,719
My bride that I took with a red veil...

881
02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:42,399
and left in my white tent.

882
02:04:45,319 --> 02:04:49,719
Was it my fate to dress you
in earth when I returned?

883
02:05:05,839 --> 02:05:08,839
If I don't get my revenge
on those who did this to you...

884
02:05:11,759 --> 02:05:13,879
let the land I tread on be my grave...

885
02:05:15,959 --> 02:05:18,159
the sheet I sleep on, my shroud...

886
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:24,759
the armor I wear, my coffin.

887
02:06:26,959 --> 02:06:29,479
Aslıhan Hatun gave her life for us.

888
02:06:31,319 --> 02:06:33,839
Not everyone could have done
what she did, brother.

889
02:06:35,719 --> 02:06:37,799
Be proud of your hatun.

890
02:06:40,279 --> 02:06:42,759
We will avenge her together.

891
02:06:48,439 --> 02:06:50,679
We will, my Bey. We will.

892
02:06:51,399 --> 02:06:53,319
And not just Aslıhan Hatun...

893
02:06:54,119 --> 02:06:57,479
but all innocents
who suffer at the hands of tyrants.

894
02:07:02,639 --> 02:07:06,439
For Aslıhan Hatun and all
the other innocents like her...

895
02:07:09,799 --> 02:07:12,839
our white swords
will not be returned to their scabbards

896
02:07:13,039 --> 02:07:16,039
until they have been turned
red with traitors' blood,

897
02:07:17,559 --> 02:07:20,479
until no traitor is left in our land...

898
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:23,839
Tooth for a tooth, blood for blood...

899
02:07:24,399 --> 02:07:26,359
Revenge!

900
02:07:26,999 --> 02:07:29,239
Revenge!

901
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:31,639
Revenge!

902
02:07:32,359 --> 02:07:34,079
Revenge!

903
02:07:34,599 --> 02:07:36,799
Revenge!

904
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:23,799
I was your son too.

905
02:08:25,559 --> 02:08:29,519
I too was ready, just like my
brother Kilicarslan,

906
02:08:30,199 --> 02:08:32,479
to give my life to glorify
the holy state of our ancestors.

907
02:08:37,399 --> 02:08:39,359
You did not deem me worthy of your throne.

908
02:08:41,719 --> 02:08:44,759
But I will prove
that I am a worthy son, Father.

909
02:08:45,919 --> 02:08:48,759
I will not let your death
or that of my brother be in vain.

910
02:08:50,759 --> 02:08:53,639
I will rid our state of the menace
which devours it from within.

911
02:09:17,839 --> 02:09:22,279
Welcome home, my Sultan.
I hope you enjoyed a successful hunt.

912
02:09:23,479 --> 02:09:25,199
It was so successful, Mother...

913
02:09:26,839 --> 02:09:28,119
that I will rebuild

914
02:09:28,399 --> 02:09:30,679
that which you destroyed
and razed to the ground.

915
02:09:32,839 --> 02:09:34,239
I didn't go hunting, Mother.

916
02:09:34,799 --> 02:09:37,319
I met with the Emir of Sivas,
Husamettin Karaca.

917
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:41,679
The spring of vengeance
has been wound, Mother.

918
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:44,839
-Did you--
-I spoke to Husamettin Karaca.

919
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:49,279
We took the necessary precautions.
He will be with Ertuğrul Bey by now.

920
02:09:53,999 --> 02:09:57,039
I hope you've thought
this through, my Sultan.

921
02:09:57,639 --> 02:09:58,839
I have done what was necessary

922
02:09:59,159 --> 02:10:01,719
for the honor of my father
and my ancestors, Mother.

923
02:10:04,199 --> 02:10:07,679
You killed my father
and turned me into Sadettin's servant.

924
02:10:09,439 --> 02:10:14,279
Now it's either Sadettin, or me.
Either the state, or rivers of blood.

925
02:10:16,279 --> 02:10:19,799
There can be no other way.
There is no turning back.

926
02:10:48,079 --> 02:10:49,879
My Bey, Artuk Bey is here.

927
02:10:50,519 --> 02:10:52,839
There's someone with him.
I don't know who.

928
02:10:58,599 --> 02:11:02,119
I told him not to come here
unless it was extremely important.

929
02:11:04,599 --> 02:11:07,319
If there's someone with him,
he must trust them.

930
02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:14,079
Let him come, Abdurrahman.

931
02:11:29,719 --> 02:11:32,999
-Greetings, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Greetings.

932
02:11:34,519 --> 02:11:38,719
Artuk Bey told me what happened.
My condolences.

933
02:11:39,039 --> 02:11:40,239
Thank you.

934
02:11:41,359 --> 02:11:44,799
-My condolences, Turgut Bey.
-Thank you.

935
02:11:48,199 --> 02:11:49,199
Who are you?

936
02:11:50,519 --> 02:11:53,199
I am the Emir of Sivas, Husamettin Karaca.

937
02:11:59,959 --> 02:12:01,319
I've heard of you.

938
02:12:02,479 --> 02:12:03,479
Welcome.

939
02:12:05,119 --> 02:12:06,399
Come, sit.

940
02:12:12,159 --> 02:12:13,359
Sit down, everyone.

941
02:12:18,119 --> 02:12:20,079
It must be important

942
02:12:20,919 --> 02:12:23,039
if you've come all
this way, Husamettin Bey.

943
02:12:23,559 --> 02:12:26,039
Our Sultan gave me his orders personally.

944
02:12:29,199 --> 02:12:32,559
Our Sultan gave you orders? What are they?

945
02:12:39,279 --> 02:12:40,279
Here.

946
02:13:04,399 --> 02:13:06,799
This is Emir Sadettin's death warrant.

947
02:13:14,639 --> 02:13:16,679
The duty you asked to be given

948
02:13:16,759 --> 02:13:18,839
has been granted to both of us,
Ertuğrul Bey.

949
02:13:20,279 --> 02:13:24,399
We will do away with
Sadettin Köpek together.

950
02:13:26,519 --> 02:13:29,399
So, the sultan has come
to the right decision at last.

951
02:13:31,159 --> 02:13:34,479
Sadettin Köpek put a stop
to our Sultan's Amid campaign,

952
02:13:34,999 --> 02:13:37,199
so was sent with the army
to Samsat Castle instead.

953
02:13:37,959 --> 02:13:39,799
Our Sultan sent him there on purpose.

954
02:13:41,039 --> 02:13:43,919
We are to ambush him
on the way back from the campaign.

955
02:13:51,079 --> 02:13:54,959
He will be returning with
a victorious army loyal to him.

956
02:13:58,159 --> 02:14:02,119
We will need to prepare for this.

957
02:14:03,759 --> 02:14:06,319
Köpek will come through Sivas
on his way back.

958
02:14:06,919 --> 02:14:08,319
We will wait for him there.

959
02:14:09,559 --> 02:14:11,919
We will first gain his trust...

960
02:14:13,079 --> 02:14:16,959
then finish him off
when he least expects it.

961
02:14:53,839 --> 02:14:59,879
<i>Shah, it has been a thousand years</i>
<i>since the world last saw the likes of me.</i>

962
02:15:01,359 --> 02:15:05,159
<i>You placed me in a land</i>
<i>belonging to someone else.</i>

963
02:15:05,799 --> 02:15:07,119
<i>But it's over now.</i>

964
02:15:07,799 --> 02:15:10,999
<i>No doubt you are surrounded</i>
<i>by a sea of people.</i>

965
02:15:11,319 --> 02:15:16,119
<i>But in the sea, the pearls are found</i>
<i>at the bottom while the scum floats.</i>

966
02:15:16,679 --> 02:15:21,439
<i>You couldn't see that.</i>
<i>It's now my time to rule.</i>

967
02:15:21,719 --> 02:15:24,759
<i>It's time that precious pearl rose</i>
<i>to the surface.</i>

968
02:15:29,159 --> 02:15:31,959
We're ready for the campaign
for Samsat Castle to commence, Eminence.

969
02:15:32,199 --> 02:15:34,279
Your army waits to salute you.

970
02:15:37,839 --> 02:15:39,839
May our holy war be blessed.

971
02:15:41,039 --> 02:15:44,079
May it be blessed!
May your victories be ever-lasting!

972
02:15:58,799 --> 02:16:01,039
Run to your undoing, Sadettin Köpek.

973
02:16:01,839 --> 02:16:03,119
Run to your undoing.

974
02:16:41,399 --> 02:16:46,879
We need to talk to whoever is against
Köpek in the state's ranks, one by one.

975
02:16:48,519 --> 02:16:52,199
We'll need them to both
support us until Köpek is dead

976
02:16:53,079 --> 02:16:57,199
and then to establish order
in the state afterwards.

977
02:16:58,559 --> 02:17:03,679
Ertuğrul Bey, right now they are
paralyzed by their fear of Köpek.

978
02:17:05,399 --> 02:17:07,559
They wait for a spark to catch light.

979
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:12,119
If we give them power and hope...

980
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:15,359
they will do what we ask of them.

981
02:17:16,999 --> 02:17:19,039
I will take on this duty myself.

982
02:17:22,479 --> 02:17:27,639
I will pull to our side
whoever is against Köpek.

983
02:17:30,839 --> 02:17:35,359
Ertuğrul Bey,
this will be our one opportunity.

984
02:17:37,119 --> 02:17:40,999
At the end of this path,
either Köpek's blood spills...

985
02:17:42,599 --> 02:17:46,119
or Köpek will spill a lot of our own.

986
02:17:52,759 --> 02:17:54,199
Come, then...

987
02:17:55,839 --> 02:17:57,719
The state needs our help.

988
02:18:02,359 --> 02:18:05,399
I ride to Sivas. My soldiers await.

989
02:18:06,439 --> 02:18:08,959
-May God not humiliate us.
-Amen.

990
02:18:10,279 --> 02:18:11,399
Godspeed.

991
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:24,399
Now we embark...
on a hard but blessed journey.

992
02:18:25,279 --> 02:18:27,359
My brave men, my alps.

993
02:18:28,519 --> 02:18:34,439
A hard but blessed duty awaits us now.

994
02:18:35,119 --> 02:18:40,959
It's time...
to sever the head of the snake

995
02:18:41,279 --> 02:18:43,199
that has buried its fangs in our state.

996
02:18:46,719 --> 02:18:51,319
The salvation of this glorious
state is in our hands.

997
02:18:54,839 --> 02:18:59,119
Our purpose and our word are one.

998
02:19:00,279 --> 02:19:04,599
For the perpetuity of the state
and the good of our land...

999
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:06,559
death to the traitors.

1000
02:19:07,359 --> 02:19:08,799
Death to the traitors!

1001
02:19:11,839 --> 02:19:15,479
Come now, my heroic men,
may our holy war be blessed!

1002
