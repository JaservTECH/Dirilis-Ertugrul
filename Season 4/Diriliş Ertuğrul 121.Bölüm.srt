1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Episode 121 will start after 12:20 min.

2
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:52,318
-Murderer! Bastard! Traitor!
-You'll get what you deserve! Traitor!

3
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:55,558
-You'll get what you deserve!
-Traitor!

4
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:01,118
He is a traitor!

5
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,318
Traitor!

6
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:09,909
He thinks he can escape from us.

7
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,432
-Let's go, Özalp.
-Come on, Brother.

8
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:22,552
What is going on outside?

9
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:33,552
Don't cry, sweet child.

10
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:36,112
Don't cry. It's okay.

11
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:38,272
Now, go to sleep.

12
00:13:39,672 --> 00:13:40,832
Almıla Hatun.

13
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,672
Sügay Hatun, what is going on outside?
They woke Osman up.

14
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:52,592
The Mongol spy tried to escape.

15
00:13:52,872 --> 00:13:54,992
That's the cause of the noise,
Almıla Hatun.

16
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,392
What are you doing here?

17
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:03,632
Osman was crying. I came to check on him.

18
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:23,352
Thank you, Almıla Hatun.

19
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:26,552
You go and rest.

20
00:14:27,352 --> 00:14:29,072
I'll take care of Osman.

21
00:14:30,112 --> 00:14:31,152
Okay then.

22
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,072
I'll check outside.

23
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,432
Let me see what's going on.

24
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:13,232
The boatman is there.

25
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:16,272
The Mongols are keeping an eye on him.

26
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:26,392
My bey, isn't there any other way?
I don't want to get in that dinghy.

27
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:30,112
I get seasick. I don't like the waves.

28
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:31,632
I feel trapped at sea.

29
00:15:32,872 --> 00:15:36,072
My bey, I have never seen Bamsi
so afraid before.

30
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:39,832
Brother, we don't have wings,
so we can't fly.

31
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:42,872
We don't have fins either,
so we can't swim.

32
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:46,512
If we don't get on that boat,

33
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:49,672
we won't get to the tribe until winter.

34
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:56,672
We need to get there quickly
to remove Noyan's spy from the tribe.

35
00:15:58,632 --> 00:16:00,432
If Noyan doesn't catch us, that is.

36
00:16:02,672 --> 00:16:03,632
My bey.

37
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:09,792
I hope those bastards don't do
anything bad before we get there.

38
00:16:11,552 --> 00:16:13,192
Noyan stationed them there...

39
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:18,352
so that they could hit us from behind
during the battle.

40
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:22,512
They'll act like one of us
until the right moment arises.

41
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:24,592
But...

42
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:27,392
Ögedei Khan is dead.

43
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:31,672
Noyan is outraged.

44
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:38,592
We need to get to the tribe
before his messengers do.

45
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:43,112
Let's deal with them quickly
and get to our tribe, my bey.

46
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:56,312
Don't let any harm come to the boatman.

47
00:16:57,352 --> 00:16:59,472
-Watch out.
-Very well.

48
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,752
Come on, my lions.

49
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:17,032
God is the greatest!

50
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:20,832
Abdur Rahman, don't let him get away!

51
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:51,792
Don't kill me!

52
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:53,872
Get up!

53
00:17:54,712 --> 00:17:57,352
Move! Move!

54
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:34,512
Move!

55
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:41,192
Please don't kill me, my bey.

56
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,432
You will take us to Anatolia right away.

57
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:46,592
Noyan will kill me, my bey.

58
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:51,192
You'll get your payment.
Then you'll be free.

59
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:55,432
You can go wherever you want,
whenever you want with your ship.

60
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:59,032
But you must take us to Anatolia
before Noyan gets there.

61
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,552
As you order, my bey.

62
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:04,392
The wind blows in your favor.
Let's hurry, then.

63
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:05,752
Let's go.

64
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:37,952
-Traitor! Get the traitor!
-He is running away!

65
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:40,392
Get him! Traitor!

66
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:45,952
Get the bastard!

67
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:48,792
He is running away, get him!

68
00:19:53,712 --> 00:19:56,272
Stop, you traitor! Get him!

69
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:59,352
Stop! Don't run! Get him!

70
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:02,272
Traitor!

71
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:23,672
Traitor!

72
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:26,072
Punish him!

73
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:33,192
-That was a nice one, Brother Günküt.
-Thank you, Brother.

74
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:44,752
There is no escape from this tribe
for bastards like you.

75
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:48,112
Move!

76
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:51,072
Why are you still letting him breathe?

77
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:53,872
Not before Ertuğrul Bey arrives.

78
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:58,472
He'll take care of him once he is here.

79
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:02,712
-Hopefully so.
-Move!

80
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:09,232
Kill him! Traitor!

81
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:30,752
Move!

82
00:21:49,272 --> 00:21:52,672
I'll make you pay
for lying to Ögedei Khan, Ertuğrul.

83
00:21:53,472 --> 00:21:56,072
I'll be the one to behead you
when the time comes.

84
00:21:56,752 --> 00:22:01,432
{\an8}If you don't die of grief
for your children, you'll die by my sword!

85
00:22:11,238 --> 00:22:15,878
{\an8}TEN DAYS LATER

86
00:22:57,302 --> 00:23:00,142
Will they stain our honor
with these leathers?

87
00:23:01,822 --> 00:23:03,182
Remake them from scratch.

88
00:23:04,902 --> 00:23:08,862
The Turks shall know
that we're the best manufacturers.

89
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,902
Take these away!

90
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:16,262
Tell them to work.

91
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:23,902
Someone is coming, Alangoya.

92
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,942
We'll learn who.

93
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:36,702
Who are you?

94
00:23:37,302 --> 00:23:38,902
Harsünlü Nurahbono.

95
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:42,102
Harsünlü Nurahbono.

96
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:44,342
Noyan sent me.

97
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:48,022
Speak.

98
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:49,822
Speak!

99
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:51,262
Tell me!

100
00:23:52,862 --> 00:23:53,942
Ögedei Khan is dead.

101
00:24:09,662 --> 00:24:12,062
What are you saying, you black dog?

102
00:24:12,182 --> 00:24:13,942
What do you mean he's dead?

103
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:18,022
Noyan and Ertuğrul came before our Khan.

104
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:23,982
Ertuğrul made everyone believe
that he obeyed our Khan.

105
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:26,542
He sent his alps forward.

106
00:24:27,262 --> 00:24:29,582
Our Khan was gone for the festivities.

107
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,942
He was dead in the night.

108
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:43,342
And Ertuğrul?

109
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:47,382
Ertuğrul and his men ran away from Noyan.

110
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:49,462
He'll be back at his village soon.

111
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:17,622
What does Noyan ask?

112
00:25:18,062 --> 00:25:21,542
That you kill Ertuğrul's family
before he returns home.

113
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:23,702
And our secret mission?

114
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:26,742
Your only secret mission is
to kill his family.

115
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:31,982
Then, you'll go to Gündoğdu Bey's village.

116
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:37,022
You'll kill Selcan Hatun, Sungurtekin Bey
and his family.

117
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:39,382
Then...

118
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,542
it's time for war.

119
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:47,502
Our army will crush the Seljuks.

120
00:25:53,462 --> 00:25:54,942
I'll go there in the morning.

121
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:57,542
If they kill me...

122
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:01,022
set off at sunrise.

123
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,502
We'll end Ertuğrul's line.

124
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:21,822
Grandmother...

125
00:26:22,062 --> 00:26:23,062
Yes.

126
00:26:23,622 --> 00:26:26,782
Still no news from Father.

127
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:28,782
I miss him.

128
00:26:29,582 --> 00:26:31,942
When will he be back?

129
00:26:38,902 --> 00:26:41,942
Patience, my son.

130
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,862
I miss Ertuğrul too.

131
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:52,582
Only God knows how much I miss him.

132
00:26:55,302 --> 00:27:00,942
May God bring him back
quickly and safely.

133
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:05,062
May he protect him from harm.

134
00:27:06,062 --> 00:27:07,302
Amen.

135
00:27:12,982 --> 00:27:15,022
<i>-Selamunaleykum.</i>
-Son!

136
00:27:15,182 --> 00:27:17,142
-Father.
-My son.

137
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:20,862
My little lion. Mashallah.

138
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:26,862
My brave son.

139
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,742
Did you look after your brothers?

140
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:31,142
Of course, Father.

141
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:32,622
I sure did.

142
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:35,422
I fed them myself.

143
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:38,022
I'm proud of you.

144
00:27:41,822 --> 00:27:42,822
Mother...

145
00:27:43,142 --> 00:27:44,142
Son...

146
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:49,502
Welcome.

147
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,742
Welcome, my brave son.

148
00:27:58,542 --> 00:27:59,822
Thank God.

149
00:28:00,982 --> 00:28:02,782
Welcome, my sons.

150
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,262
Thank you, mother.

151
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:18,582
Oh, my son.

152
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:27,142
Artuk Bey.

153
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,622
My Bey.

154
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:32,502
Welcome, my Bey.

155
00:28:32,902 --> 00:28:34,182
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

156
00:28:34,302 --> 00:28:35,502
Thank God.

157
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:36,822
Indeed.

158
00:28:42,662 --> 00:28:43,742
Chief Alp Bamsi.

159
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:46,902
-Welcome.
-Artuk Bey, thanks.

160
00:28:53,622 --> 00:28:54,622
Welcome.

161
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,302
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

162
00:28:56,422 --> 00:29:00,422
Now that you've returned safely,
my prayers have been answered.

163
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:03,822
What happened? Tell me.

164
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,502
We did the duty the Sultan gave us.

165
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:12,622
Bless God, the peace is signed.

166
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:14,862
Thank Goodness.

167
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,262
My Osman.

168
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:25,622
Welcome.

169
00:29:27,222 --> 00:29:28,222
My Osman.

170
00:29:36,662 --> 00:29:38,742
My little son.

171
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:45,062
My strong son.

172
00:29:46,222 --> 00:29:48,422
Your eyes are beautiful.

173
00:29:56,142 --> 00:29:58,422
Osman looks strong, Mother.

174
00:29:59,822 --> 00:30:02,182
You looked after him well.

175
00:30:06,142 --> 00:30:07,142
Sugay Hatun.

176
00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:10,022
God bless you.

177
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:18,902
-Where is Savcı?
-Inside. He's sleeping.

178
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,782
Good. Let him sleep.

179
00:30:30,502 --> 00:30:33,502
Come, Mother. We must talk.

180
00:30:34,862 --> 00:30:35,862
Okay, son.

181
00:30:55,142 --> 00:30:56,182
Tell me.

182
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,022
What's the matter?

183
00:31:00,422 --> 00:31:01,822
Where is Almıla?

184
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,022
At the tannery.

185
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:05,502
Why?

186
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:13,942
We learned that Almıla's real name
is Alangoya.

187
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:16,542
Alangoya?

188
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:23,502
Almıla is actually
that scum Noyan's sister.

189
00:31:26,862 --> 00:31:30,422
She infiltrated us.

190
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:36,702
But...

191
00:31:37,982 --> 00:31:39,662
What are you saying?

192
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:43,222
How could this happen?

193
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:45,662
We learned it at Ögedei's base.

194
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:49,822
Don't tell anyone yet.

195
00:31:54,822 --> 00:31:56,822
So, that girl I considered...

196
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:01,222
a daughter was an enemy?

197
00:32:06,822 --> 00:32:09,782
She infiltrated us.

198
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,022
Indeed, Mother.

199
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:17,582
We couldn't tell friend from foe
for a long time.

200
00:32:19,342 --> 00:32:22,222
Now it's time to see the difference.

201
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:27,302
First, I'll make the Mongol spy
caught by Günalp Bey talk.

202
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:30,742
Excuse me, Mother.

203
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:02,942
Thank goodness.

204
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:05,342
Welcome, my Bey.

205
00:33:06,222 --> 00:33:07,822
Thank you, Oğuz Alp.

206
00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:11,542
Did he talk?

207
00:33:12,022 --> 00:33:15,302
Not yet. We didn't push him
until you came back.

208
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:34,542
Good.

209
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:50,182
Who is your leader?

210
00:33:51,222 --> 00:33:52,822
Who gives you orders?

211
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:55,582
Noyan!

212
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:56,942
Only Noyan.

213
00:33:58,262 --> 00:33:59,262
Besides him.

214
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:01,582
There's no one else.

215
00:34:03,982 --> 00:34:06,942
And Noyan's sister, Alangoya?

216
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:10,102
I mean Almıla Hatun...

217
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:16,702
Her men at the tannery.

218
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,702
They're all Mongol spies.

219
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:24,062
Don't deny it. I know everything.

220
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:31,462
Almıla is Noyan's sister, Alangoya.

221
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,342
Her men are Mergen the hunter...

222
00:34:37,022 --> 00:34:38,142
and Samuan Bergütay.

223
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:43,422
Noyan told us to come here.

224
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:45,342
Our goal was...

225
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:49,822
to destroy you from within.

226
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:58,142
Let me go! I'll do anything!

227
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:09,782
Forgive.

228
00:35:10,302 --> 00:35:11,302
Forgive me.

229
00:35:15,422 --> 00:35:18,222
In the lands of Ertuğrul,
son of Suleyman Shah...

230
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:22,262
there's no mercy...

231
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:27,382
for traitors.

232
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:54,462
<i>Kadan Khan!</i>

233
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:24,982
Kadan.

234
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:27,302
Noyan.

235
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:39,902
While we were still mourning
for Genghis Khan,

236
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:44,102
we sent your dear father Ögedei Khan
to the spirits.

237
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:47,822
I'm sorry.

238
00:36:49,102 --> 00:36:51,462
I feel your pain.

239
00:37:50,582 --> 00:37:52,502
After my father Ögedei,

240
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:56,422
my mother rules,

241
00:37:57,182 --> 00:37:59,342
as the regent.

242
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:04,782
We decided this would be best,

243
00:38:05,622 --> 00:38:07,942
to preserve the State,

244
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:12,662
with my brother Göyük.

245
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:19,822
May Tengri keep Töregene Hatun strong.

246
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:28,022
I've become the ruler
of Desht-i Kipchak...

247
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:34,582
in accordance
with Genghis Khan's partition.

248
00:38:38,302 --> 00:38:44,822
Strengthening the rule of Europe
will also be my duty.

249
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,902
May Tengri help you, my Khan.

250
00:38:50,422 --> 00:38:52,142
About you, Noyan.

251
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:57,942
Yarımagun acquired a great piece of China.

252
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,462
He subdued them.

253
00:39:03,822 --> 00:39:08,542
And you get Anatolia.

254
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:29,822
The two-year peace agreement
that my father made

255
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:32,382
with the Seljuks,

256
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:38,622
has no meaning for me nor for my mother.

257
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:44,022
Take my army and go quickly!

258
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:55,382
Hearing this great news that I have
waited for so long from you

259
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:58,822
has made me the happiest man in the world.

260
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:03,502
The sitting man grows fat.

261
00:40:04,782 --> 00:40:06,462
The moving dog finds a bone.

262
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:10,262
As your loyal dog,

263
00:40:11,262 --> 00:40:15,102
I'll go to Anatolia to bring you
flesh and blood.

264
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:30,062
Victory...

265
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:32,182
or victory!

266
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:35,462
I don't deserve death.

267
00:41:44,382 --> 00:41:45,382
They're back.

268
00:41:47,182 --> 00:41:48,702
Be careful, Mergen.

269
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,902
The rats want to escape.

270
00:42:06,062 --> 00:42:07,062
Easy.

271
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:15,662
Welcome, Turgut Bey.

272
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:17,862
Welcome.

273
00:42:20,582 --> 00:42:23,102
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

274
00:42:35,782 --> 00:42:36,782
What's the matter?

275
00:42:38,782 --> 00:42:40,622
Are you closing the tannery?

276
00:42:43,742 --> 00:42:44,822
What's all this?

277
00:42:45,622 --> 00:42:47,422
Only reorganizing.

278
00:42:53,182 --> 00:42:54,422
You brought alps.

279
00:42:57,222 --> 00:42:58,702
Is there a problem?

280
00:42:59,302 --> 00:43:02,502
Yes. There is. An important problem.

281
00:43:03,022 --> 00:43:04,022
What?

282
00:43:06,062 --> 00:43:07,182
Nothing to worry about.

283
00:43:09,982 --> 00:43:13,822
We learned about the Mongols
infiltrating our lands.

284
00:43:15,822 --> 00:43:16,822
Did you?

285
00:43:20,622 --> 00:43:22,262
Also, their identities...

286
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:26,782
Who are they?

287
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:28,782
Guess who!

288
00:43:30,062 --> 00:43:31,062
Guess who!

289
00:43:31,462 --> 00:43:34,102
Guess who!

290
00:43:36,502 --> 00:43:37,502
Tanners.

291
00:43:39,782 --> 00:43:40,902
Bergütay.

292
00:44:14,462 --> 00:44:16,382
<i>Permission to enter, Mother Hayme?</i>

293
00:44:17,662 --> 00:44:18,662
Come in, dear.

294
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:30,702
Where are Gündüz and Savcı?

295
00:44:31,822 --> 00:44:34,542
They're with Sugay Hatun. Why?

296
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:37,622
We'll leave tomorrow to sell leather.

297
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:43,662
I wanted to see you before I go
and to see and kiss the kids goodbye.

298
00:44:44,822 --> 00:44:46,102
Good thinking, dear.

299
00:44:47,582 --> 00:44:48,902
Come, sit.

300
00:44:53,422 --> 00:44:56,142
Once Osman is asleep, I'll come.

301
00:45:02,262 --> 00:45:04,342
I had a dream, Mother Hayme.

302
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:06,742
What did you see?

303
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:11,822
I saw Ertuğrul Bey safely returning.

304
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:14,502
I hope that will be true.

305
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:20,582
We know the Mongols are among us.

306
00:45:21,782 --> 00:45:23,982
They're so close.

307
00:45:24,942 --> 00:45:27,862
We suspect
that they're even in our village,

308
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:31,382
even in our tents.

309
00:45:33,662 --> 00:45:35,062
How can that be?

310
00:45:35,742 --> 00:45:38,342
Günalp Bey caught Noyan's scum.

311
00:45:39,142 --> 00:45:40,982
Günalp Bey sent news, dear.

312
00:45:41,582 --> 00:45:43,262
He learned the truth.

313
00:45:44,782 --> 00:45:50,582
Noyan's spy he brought here was
just a pawn.

314
00:45:56,182 --> 00:45:57,942
They fooled us all.

315
00:45:59,662 --> 00:46:02,782
They wanted to take advantage

316
00:46:03,182 --> 00:46:05,422
of us sharing our village,
our happiness,

317
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:08,662
and sadness.

318
00:46:13,462 --> 00:46:15,262
Where is Günalp Bey now?

319
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:20,422
He took his soldiers to ambush that scum.

320
00:46:27,342 --> 00:46:29,222
Who is the scum, Mother?

321
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:34,582
Noyan's sister, Alangoya.

322
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,462
You'll all die!

323
00:46:51,782 --> 00:46:53,902
A snake in my tribe!

324
00:46:54,702 --> 00:46:56,182
And now she dies.

325
00:47:26,222 --> 00:47:32,062
Don't try to bite off
more than you can chew.

326
00:47:39,382 --> 00:47:41,382
You cleaned our tribe's honor

327
00:47:42,662 --> 00:47:44,542
with Suleyman Shah's sword.

328
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:46,822
You deserved to kill her.

329
00:47:47,182 --> 00:47:49,782
May you spill Noyan's blood, son.

330
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,422
May God grant you to avenge the ones

331
00:47:55,302 --> 00:47:57,542
whose blood he spilled.

332
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,022
God willing, mother.

333
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:02,382
God willing.

334
00:48:15,382 --> 00:48:17,382
You came to the wrong place.

335
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:20,702
We are not prey.

336
00:48:20,942 --> 00:48:22,342
I hunted many men.

337
00:48:22,702 --> 00:48:24,742
Now you'll be my biggest prize!

338
00:49:36,702 --> 00:49:38,982
Brother, are you okay?

339
00:49:42,582 --> 00:49:44,182
I'm fine, brother.

340
00:49:45,622 --> 00:49:47,942
I was just about to take his head...

341
00:49:49,382 --> 00:49:50,742
but these dogs attacked me.

342
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:53,862
So, he saw this and...

343
00:49:55,502 --> 00:49:56,502
ran away.

344
00:49:57,782 --> 00:49:59,062
Don't worry, brother.

345
00:50:00,102 --> 00:50:03,222
Don't be hard on yourself.

346
00:50:03,382 --> 00:50:05,582
Look, we killed them all.

347
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:07,942
Where will that dog go?

348
00:50:08,262 --> 00:50:11,342
We'll surely get him.

349
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:17,982
Brother. Our Bey killed Almıla.

350
00:50:19,502 --> 00:50:21,422
Come. Let's go home.

351
00:50:23,942 --> 00:50:25,342
Let's go, brother.

352
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:29,182
Let's go. Come on, alps!

353
00:50:43,622 --> 00:50:44,942
Come on!

354
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:17,302
When we enter Anatolia,

355
00:51:18,422 --> 00:51:21,622
we'll kill the Turks that don't obey us.

356
00:51:24,022 --> 00:51:27,302
The ones who obey will be our slaves.

357
00:51:27,982 --> 00:51:32,062
May Tengri bless your sword, Noyan.

358
00:51:37,342 --> 00:51:38,342
But...

359
00:51:39,422 --> 00:51:42,422
we'll let them kill each other first.

360
00:51:44,422 --> 00:51:46,182
They'll blind themselves.

361
00:51:47,342 --> 00:51:48,822
They'll cut their own tongues.

362
00:51:53,182 --> 00:51:55,942
Crows will feed on their corpses.

363
00:51:58,142 --> 00:52:00,662
Anatolia will be a warzone.

364
00:52:02,982 --> 00:52:04,982
Many spies are among the Turks,

365
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:08,462
just like my sister Alangoya.

366
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:14,262
They will always provoke rebellions.

367
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:17,102
And everything...

368
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,742
will be so messed up that...

369
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:26,462
young Sultan Gıyaseddin will become
the rebel Turks' puppet.

370
00:52:27,382 --> 00:52:34,382
Sultan Gıyaseddin gathers an army
of Frankish soldiers to fight us.

371
00:52:35,302 --> 00:52:39,182
Franks will just bring more flame
to the fire in Anatolia.

372
00:52:40,942 --> 00:52:43,782
Whatever happens,

373
00:52:44,502 --> 00:52:47,702
I'll trap the Turks at Kösedağ in the end.

374
00:52:50,622 --> 00:52:53,262
I've wandered there for months.

375
00:52:54,662 --> 00:52:57,382
That's where I'll make my <i>coup de grace</i>.

376
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:09,582
Let all my forces unite and march
as soon as possible.

377
00:53:24,102 --> 00:53:25,102
And Nicaea?

378
00:53:29,622 --> 00:53:33,102
We'll crush the Turks from the east.

379
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:39,942
When Ertuğrul is crushed,

380
00:53:41,342 --> 00:53:43,102
it will be Nicaea's turn.

381
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:22,342
Son...

382
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:27,862
I think about Turgut, Mother.

383
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:32,342
I hope they killed those scum.

384
00:54:33,022 --> 00:54:34,022
Of course, they did.

385
00:54:34,782 --> 00:54:36,182
Don't worry.

386
00:54:36,942 --> 00:54:40,342
Nobody can run away from them.

387
00:54:40,862 --> 00:54:41,862
Indeed.

388
00:54:43,422 --> 00:54:44,422
Indeed.

389
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:49,502
Did you ever kill an enemy, Grandmother?

390
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,982
I did...

391
00:54:54,342 --> 00:54:55,862
Many times...

392
00:54:57,102 --> 00:54:58,102
My Gündüz...

393
00:54:59,222 --> 00:55:01,222
My mother's hands are talented.

394
00:55:03,422 --> 00:55:04,822
Both at curing our friends...

395
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:08,862
and killing enemies.

396
00:55:11,662 --> 00:55:13,302
<i>Permission to enter, my Bey?</i>

397
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:14,742
Here they are.

398
00:55:15,342 --> 00:55:17,982
Come, brothers.

399
00:55:23,182 --> 00:55:26,222
There are my brave men!

400
00:55:29,262 --> 00:55:30,822
Thank goodness.

401
00:55:33,742 --> 00:55:36,342
My brave warriors.

402
00:55:37,302 --> 00:55:41,022
My Bey, God granted us victory
over the scum.

403
00:55:41,662 --> 00:55:43,342
We killed them all, my Bey.

404
00:55:43,502 --> 00:55:46,182
I'm so proud of you.

405
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,062
Mashallah.

406
00:55:48,382 --> 00:55:50,382
God bless your hands.

407
00:55:51,142 --> 00:55:55,582
May he keep your swords ever sharp.

408
00:55:57,182 --> 00:55:59,182
-Amen, my Bey.
-Thanks, my Bey.

409
00:56:03,342 --> 00:56:04,342
Mashallah.

410
00:56:05,822 --> 00:56:06,822
Mashallah.

411
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:18,302
My grandmother killed Almıla, Turgut Bey.

412
00:56:21,302 --> 00:56:24,702
She killed that snake with her sword.

413
00:56:27,902 --> 00:56:29,142
Well done, Mother.

414
00:56:30,742 --> 00:56:32,382
Let me kiss that hand.

415
00:56:34,262 --> 00:56:35,822
God bless you, Mother.

416
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:37,542
Son...

417
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:46,982
My mother has led women for years.

418
00:56:47,102 --> 00:56:49,342
Almıla is nothing for her.

419
00:56:49,422 --> 00:56:50,822
My dear Mother.

420
00:56:55,062 --> 00:56:56,062
Turgut Bey...

421
00:57:02,262 --> 00:57:03,262
Artuk Bey.

422
00:57:06,302 --> 00:57:07,342
Chief Alp Bamsi.

423
00:57:14,302 --> 00:57:19,702
Glory to your hearts
and your swords, my sons.

424
00:57:20,702 --> 00:57:21,702
Thanks, mother.

425
00:57:21,822 --> 00:57:24,902
He who follows God has many enemies.

426
00:57:25,822 --> 00:57:30,382
May God grant us the strength,
courage and power

427
00:57:30,862 --> 00:57:33,622
to face those enemies.

428
00:57:35,542 --> 00:57:37,502
May we always be victorious.

429
00:57:37,982 --> 00:57:39,702
-Amen, Mother.
-Amen.

430
00:57:40,142 --> 00:57:41,142
Amen, Mother.

431
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:42,422
My Gündüz.

432
00:57:43,142 --> 00:57:45,302
Go, be with your brothers.

433
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,422
As you order, my Bey.

434
00:57:56,462 --> 00:58:01,262
Since we took care of this,
now it's time.

435
00:58:03,662 --> 00:58:05,502
Time for what, my Bey?

436
00:58:05,622 --> 00:58:07,302
To migrate, brothers.

437
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:10,782
Send news.

438
00:58:11,182 --> 00:58:12,822
We migrate to Söğüt.

439
00:58:13,222 --> 00:58:15,022
-Alright, my Bey.
-Alright, my Bey.

440
00:58:16,302 --> 00:58:17,302
It's tradition.

441
00:58:17,902 --> 00:58:19,982
We must hold a council before we go.

442
00:58:21,222 --> 00:58:24,622
So, we'll listen to the beys
before we go,

443
00:58:24,782 --> 00:58:26,822
and we'll hear about the tribes.

444
00:58:27,142 --> 00:58:30,822
Then, I'll make preparations
at the Hanlı Bazaar.

445
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:33,262
-Thanks, Artuk Bey.
-Thank you.

446
00:58:33,462 --> 00:58:36,342
<i>-Permission to enter, my Bey?</i>
-Come, Melikşah.

447
00:58:40,862 --> 00:58:41,862
Speak.

448
00:58:42,182 --> 00:58:44,742
My Bey... messengers from Nicaea.

449
00:58:44,902 --> 00:58:45,902
From Nicaea?

450
00:58:47,182 --> 00:58:48,382
Who? The Governor?

451
00:58:48,582 --> 00:58:50,462
No, my Bey. The Emperor's son.

452
00:58:55,182 --> 00:58:56,542
The Emperor's son?

453
00:58:58,422 --> 00:59:02,822
My Bey. Why would the Emperor's son come?

454
00:59:03,782 --> 00:59:06,422
Surely, to make a treaty, Bamsi.

455
00:59:08,422 --> 00:59:11,902
They know they can't fight
against the Turks.

456
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:17,582
Especially when the Mongols are close.

457
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:22,702
Welcome the Emperor's son before the tent,
Turgut.

458
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:25,622
Then invite him in.

459
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:26,982
As you order.

460
00:59:27,702 --> 00:59:28,702
Artuk Bey...

461
00:59:29,742 --> 00:59:31,062
Stay with me.

462
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:32,742
As my Bey commands.

463
00:59:33,662 --> 00:59:35,382
As you order.

464
01:00:04,822 --> 01:00:07,182
Let me help you, Sugay Hatun.

465
01:00:09,422 --> 01:00:12,422
I'm so proud of you, my boy.

466
01:00:22,302 --> 01:00:25,942
The Emperor's son is here to see Ertuğrul.

467
01:00:28,262 --> 01:00:29,582
Why, Mother Hayme?

468
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:36,982
For peace and for the issue of Söğüt.

469
01:00:39,942 --> 01:00:40,942
Grandmother...

470
01:00:41,462 --> 01:00:46,502
The Emperor's son himself comes here
to see my father.

471
01:00:47,182 --> 01:00:51,302
How did my father become so strong?

472
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:54,942
Sit down.

473
01:00:55,302 --> 01:00:56,902
Sit down. I'll tell you.

474
01:01:02,062 --> 01:01:05,182
Everything started when Suleyman Shah

475
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:09,342
sent Ertuğrul to Aleppo as a messenger.

476
01:01:13,342 --> 01:01:14,622
<i>What do you want?</i>

477
01:01:15,182 --> 01:01:17,862
I'm the messenger of Suleyman Shah,
the Bey of Kayıs.

478
01:01:18,022 --> 01:01:20,022
I'm his son. Ertuğrul.

479
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,422
I'm here to ask for land.

480
01:01:24,102 --> 01:01:25,982
What will you give in return?

481
01:01:26,422 --> 01:01:30,182
In return, 2,000 alps will be with you
every time you need them.

482
01:01:31,782 --> 01:01:32,782
Two-thousand alps, huh?

483
01:01:34,182 --> 01:01:37,222
Even my palace has more guards.

484
01:01:38,342 --> 01:01:40,102
Safe travels, son of Bey.

485
01:01:40,622 --> 01:01:41,622
Next.

486
01:01:44,022 --> 01:01:45,022
My Bey.

487
01:01:45,182 --> 01:01:46,222
Next.

488
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:47,502
My Bey.

489
01:01:48,222 --> 01:01:49,222
Come on!

490
01:01:50,062 --> 01:01:51,062
Come on!

491
01:02:07,662 --> 01:02:09,982
Your guards are three less.

492
01:02:12,342 --> 01:02:17,902
Whatever your father did,
he got lands from the Emir of Aleppo.

493
01:02:19,822 --> 01:02:22,702
But it wasn't easy.

494
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:27,662
Your father had many troubles.

495
01:02:29,022 --> 01:02:31,502
He had many threats.

496
01:02:33,582 --> 01:02:38,662
He risked many things
so that we'd have a land to call home.

497
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:42,422
We lost many people to have a land.

498
01:02:45,022 --> 01:02:46,462
We faced many troubles.

499
01:02:48,782 --> 01:02:53,662
Ertuğrul risked his life many times
so that we'd have a permanent home.

500
01:02:55,462 --> 01:02:57,262
He risked death many times.

501
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:06,182
What a glorious man my father is.

502
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:08,422
What great troubles he faced.

503
01:04:08,942 --> 01:04:11,062
Me and my brothers,

504
01:04:11,942 --> 01:04:16,942
we'll be brave beys worthy of our father.

505
01:04:17,942 --> 01:04:21,502
God willing. You will all be so.

506
01:04:27,102 --> 01:04:30,262
Just as I believe in your father,

507
01:04:31,422 --> 01:04:33,102
I believe in you.

508
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:41,902
Because you will walk in the path
that your father made.

509
01:04:45,102 --> 01:04:50,302
You'll help the innocent and fight evil.

510
01:04:52,302 --> 01:04:53,382
Amen, Grandmother.

511
01:05:09,782 --> 01:05:12,822
It's obvious he's the Emperor's son.

512
01:05:13,822 --> 01:05:15,462
Do you think he brings trouble?

513
01:05:18,142 --> 01:05:20,422
He won't, if he likes to live.

514
01:05:24,782 --> 01:05:25,982
He shouldn't, brother.

515
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,382
He shouldn't.

516
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:48,142
I'm Prince Theodor.

517
01:05:49,022 --> 01:05:52,142
I'm the son and heir of Emperor Yannis.

518
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:54,262
I'm Turgut Bey, Bey of the Cavdars.

519
01:05:55,862 --> 01:05:57,702
Welcome, Prince Theodor.

520
01:06:00,062 --> 01:06:02,662
I'm here to see Ertuğrul Bey
in our Emperor's name.

521
01:06:03,702 --> 01:06:06,942
I wish to present our gifts
and offer for peace.

522
01:06:09,742 --> 01:06:11,142
Ertuğrul Bey waits in the tent.

523
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:16,182
Abdur Rahman, let him know.

524
01:06:36,302 --> 01:06:37,782
Prince Theodor is here.

525
01:06:38,822 --> 01:06:40,102
Let him in.

526
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,430
Welcome, Prince Theodor.

527
01:06:58,590 --> 01:06:59,870
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.

528
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:01,030
Please.

529
01:07:08,712 --> 01:07:10,952
We brought you offers of peace before.

530
01:07:11,072 --> 01:07:12,872
But they were broken.

531
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:16,152
I'm here for a serious
and lasting agreement.

532
01:07:17,472 --> 01:07:20,112
First, I want you to accept our gifts.

533
01:07:39,432 --> 01:07:40,952
Thank you for the gifts.

534
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:47,072
As you said, you brought offers
of peace before.

535
01:07:47,672 --> 01:07:49,352
We never denied them.

536
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:51,352
Yet, they were all broken.

537
01:07:52,592 --> 01:07:55,992
The reason was betrayal
by your governors and commanders.

538
01:07:57,832 --> 01:08:00,352
I, the Heir Apparent
of the Byzantine throne,

539
01:08:00,632 --> 01:08:02,872
came personally to reassure you.

540
01:08:04,032 --> 01:08:05,112
Ögedei Khan is dead.

541
01:08:05,632 --> 01:08:07,832
The Mongols will head to Anatolia.

542
01:08:08,032 --> 01:08:10,272
They will try to destroy us both.

543
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:15,912
Why be destroyed
when we can live in peace?

544
01:08:18,672 --> 01:08:22,112
Nobody will dare betray and
break the peace, rest assured.

545
01:08:24,712 --> 01:08:25,712
Prince Theodor.

546
01:08:27,112 --> 01:08:31,432
We never deny an offer of peace.

547
01:08:34,072 --> 01:08:37,192
And as long as you keep
your end of the deal,

548
01:08:37,432 --> 01:08:39,712
we'll treat you fairly.

549
01:08:41,312 --> 01:08:46,072
And as long as they're honorable,
we'll treat our enemies the same way.

550
01:08:48,112 --> 01:08:50,272
When your great Sultan Alparslan defeated

551
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:53,232
and captured Emperor
Romanos Diogenes at Manzikert,

552
01:08:53,632 --> 01:08:56,032
he treated him fairly and like a friend.

553
01:08:57,872 --> 01:09:00,112
I know that you're honorable as well.

554
01:09:00,232 --> 01:09:03,792
That's why making a peace agreement
with you is an honor for us.

555
01:09:13,472 --> 01:09:14,472
Abdur Rahman.

556
01:09:34,792 --> 01:09:37,072
I sign in the name of our Emperor.

557
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:12,672
And I sign as Frontier Bey,

558
01:10:12,992 --> 01:10:16,192
with the authority given to me
by the Seljuk State

559
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:18,472
and the Sultan.

560
01:11:06,552 --> 01:11:10,792
When we settle in Söğüt, we'll build
a bazaar greater than Hanlı Bazaar.

561
01:11:11,712 --> 01:11:15,112
The Greek merchants can trade there
as they wish.

562
01:11:16,392 --> 01:11:19,512
We'll ensure their safety.

563
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:23,192
We'll do our best to support
the new bazaar

564
01:11:23,272 --> 01:11:25,752
as long as the peace lasts, Ertuğrul Bey.

565
01:11:31,032 --> 01:11:33,232
May our peace be eternal, Ertuğrul Bey.

566
01:11:34,072 --> 01:11:35,632
God willing, Prince Theodor.

567
01:11:37,392 --> 01:11:38,392
Please.

568
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:44,952
Farewell, Prince Theodor.

569
01:11:54,152 --> 01:11:55,872
Then what happened, Grandmother?

570
01:11:57,712 --> 01:11:59,112
That's all for now.

571
01:11:59,592 --> 01:12:03,712
Your father can tell you the rest
after the council...

572
01:12:04,872 --> 01:12:05,872
tonight.

573
01:12:06,672 --> 01:12:08,912
Am I going to the council?

574
01:12:11,032 --> 01:12:13,312
Of course, a brave bey like you.

575
01:12:13,552 --> 01:12:15,472
You deserve to be there.

576
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:17,992
Really, Grandmother?

577
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:21,352
Am I invited as a bey?

578
01:12:21,592 --> 01:12:24,392
Of course, son. It was time.

579
01:12:24,912 --> 01:12:27,712
Everyone wants to see you there as a bey.

580
01:12:28,312 --> 01:12:29,592
I'm a bey too.

581
01:12:30,152 --> 01:12:31,592
I'll go to the council.

582
01:12:32,392 --> 01:12:36,672
I'll scare the evil men.
I'll help the poor fellows.

583
01:12:37,352 --> 01:12:39,872
I'll be a brave bey like my father.

584
01:12:41,032 --> 01:12:42,192
God willing, son.

585
01:12:50,072 --> 01:12:51,872
He's really happy, Mother Hayme.

586
01:12:52,512 --> 01:12:54,512
May God always keep him happy.

587
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:57,232
May his fate be good.

588
01:12:59,392 --> 01:13:01,192
May they ever be happy.

589
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:02,632
Amen.

590
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:19,472
Since the Prince of Nicaea came himself,
they must be in trouble, my Bey.

591
01:13:19,792 --> 01:13:23,672
Brother,
the Emperor has no governors left.

592
01:13:23,872 --> 01:13:27,112
So, he sent his own son,
what choice did he have?

593
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:33,232
They're scared of the Mongols, Bamsı.

594
01:13:35,232 --> 01:13:37,472
They know that if we're not in Anatolia,

595
01:13:38,112 --> 01:13:44,712
Mongols will ride unopposed
and destroy them easily.

596
01:13:46,352 --> 01:13:48,832
That's why they want peace.

597
01:13:49,232 --> 01:13:53,072
Prince Theodor was serious about peace,
my Bey.

598
01:13:54,192 --> 01:13:57,832
Normally, they shouldn't dare break it

599
01:13:58,192 --> 01:14:00,672
until the Mongols are taken care of,
my Bey.

600
01:14:01,472 --> 01:14:03,152
I think the same, Artuk Bey.

601
01:14:05,912 --> 01:14:08,672
The Prince assured me.

602
01:14:11,712 --> 01:14:14,632
But, just in case.

603
01:14:15,032 --> 01:14:16,832
Let's stay vigilant.

604
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,672
All right, my Bey.

605
01:14:19,192 --> 01:14:22,432
My Bey... The infidels are beaten
every time.

606
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:26,592
They know they can't fight us and win.

607
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:33,672
God willing, the Mongol devils
will understand that too.

608
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:35,832
Bamsı...

609
01:14:36,352 --> 01:14:38,992
If the world wants peace and tranquility,

610
01:14:39,552 --> 01:14:42,632
it should know that
it must not fight the Turks.

611
01:14:45,872 --> 01:14:47,472
Once the Turk is angry,

612
01:14:48,312 --> 01:14:50,992
they all know what will happen.

613
01:14:51,712 --> 01:14:53,032
Rest assured.

614
01:14:53,712 --> 01:14:55,592
-Yes, my Bey.
-Indeed.

615
01:14:56,472 --> 01:15:00,392
My Bey, everyone is working hard
for migration.

616
01:15:00,752 --> 01:15:01,752
Good.

617
01:15:02,352 --> 01:15:04,272
Be with them, Turgut.

618
01:15:05,712 --> 01:15:08,552
So, you can help them when needed.

619
01:15:09,192 --> 01:15:10,912
All right, my Bey.

620
01:15:11,992 --> 01:15:14,072
-Thanks, brothers.
-Excuse us.

621
01:16:01,792 --> 01:16:03,272
You were a bird of prey.

622
01:16:04,352 --> 01:16:06,832
Now you're a scared sparrow, Ulu Kam.

623
01:16:07,432 --> 01:16:09,672
News from Karacahisar, Noyan.

624
01:16:23,432 --> 01:16:24,432
What happened?

625
01:16:25,352 --> 01:16:26,352
Speak.

626
01:16:31,352 --> 01:16:33,032
Ertuğrul's alps...

627
01:16:38,352 --> 01:16:39,752
attacked the tannery...

628
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:42,592
and killed everyone.

629
01:16:43,272 --> 01:16:44,272
How?

630
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:46,392
How?

631
01:16:46,952 --> 01:16:48,552
How did Ertuğrul know?

632
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:51,672
And Alangoya?

633
01:16:54,872 --> 01:16:56,912
Tell me! What happened to my sister?

634
01:17:05,552 --> 01:17:06,552
She was--

635
01:17:09,432 --> 01:17:10,952
Ertuğrul and his mother...

636
01:17:13,032 --> 01:17:15,272
trapped her in their tent.

637
01:17:53,952 --> 01:17:58,992
Ertuğrul!

638
01:18:05,312 --> 01:18:08,432
Ertuğrul!

639
01:18:09,312 --> 01:18:10,312
Ertuğrul!

640
01:18:42,432 --> 01:18:43,432
Good day.

641
01:18:45,192 --> 01:18:46,192
Good day.

642
01:18:47,912 --> 01:18:51,112
Come, brother. Let's see the situation.

643
01:18:53,992 --> 01:18:54,992
Onur Bey.

644
01:18:55,432 --> 01:18:56,872
-Çalık Bey.
-Bring that too!

645
01:18:57,272 --> 01:18:58,272
Good day.

646
01:18:58,392 --> 01:19:01,432
-Thanks, Turgut Bey.
-Welcome, Turgut Bey.

647
01:19:01,872 --> 01:19:04,912
-Thank you.
-Good day.

648
01:19:08,112 --> 01:19:09,232
It seems that...

649
01:19:10,632 --> 01:19:11,952
the village is ready.

650
01:19:12,472 --> 01:19:13,592
It is, my Bey.

651
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:15,872
Everything should be done before sundown.

652
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:17,792
Good, good.

653
01:19:17,952 --> 01:19:21,752
All our cart-pulling animals look healthy.

654
01:19:22,112 --> 01:19:24,632
They'll go fast in the mountains.

655
01:19:25,472 --> 01:19:28,392
-Great.
-Mashallah.

656
01:19:32,152 --> 01:19:34,392
Father, you're tired.
I brought you water.

657
01:19:34,912 --> 01:19:37,392
Give it to Turgut Bey and Chief Alp Bamsı.

658
01:19:53,272 --> 01:19:54,752
Oh... Thank you.

659
01:19:55,432 --> 01:19:57,592
Thanks.

660
01:19:57,872 --> 01:19:59,872
May you be healthy as this water.

661
01:20:00,512 --> 01:20:02,272
May it relieve you, Chief Alp Bamsı.

662
01:20:02,872 --> 01:20:03,992
Mashallah.

663
01:20:04,272 --> 01:20:05,912
Do you want some, Turgut Bey?

664
01:20:06,472 --> 01:20:08,312
-Thanks.
-Come on, dear.

665
01:20:08,672 --> 01:20:10,632
Give water to the others too.

666
01:20:12,632 --> 01:20:13,632
Mashallah.

667
01:20:14,152 --> 01:20:16,632
So, do you need anything?

668
01:20:17,072 --> 01:20:20,152
No, Chief Alp Bamsı.
The animals are enough.

669
01:20:20,352 --> 01:20:22,112
They'll be enough for our load.

670
01:20:22,712 --> 01:20:24,312
We're dismantling the tents.

671
01:20:24,592 --> 01:20:26,512
We'll take care of them.

672
01:20:26,912 --> 01:20:27,912
All right.

673
01:20:28,632 --> 01:20:30,472
Let us know if you need anything.

674
01:20:30,872 --> 01:20:32,832
-Take care.
-Thanks, my Bey.

675
01:20:33,152 --> 01:20:34,272
Good day.

676
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,992
Our Frontier Bey, Ertuğrul Bey!

677
01:21:26,592 --> 01:21:28,672
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

678
01:21:42,192 --> 01:21:43,192
Please, beys.

679
01:21:53,192 --> 01:21:54,712
In all 99 names of God...

680
01:21:55,352 --> 01:22:00,192
he who created and filled
our hearts with faith.

681
01:22:05,872 --> 01:22:08,352
Our council has started.

682
01:22:09,152 --> 01:22:10,752
Amen.

683
01:22:12,232 --> 01:22:14,832
You went to the Mongol Khan Ögedei
as a messenger

684
01:22:15,192 --> 01:22:17,992
and came back alive, Ertuğrul Bey,
praise God.

685
01:22:18,912 --> 01:22:21,952
And you took out the Mongol spies here.

686
01:22:23,432 --> 01:22:24,632
Thank you, my Beys.

687
01:22:26,552 --> 01:22:27,632
Ögedei Khan is dead.

688
01:22:29,592 --> 01:22:32,912
We took out some Mongol spies among us.

689
01:22:34,392 --> 01:22:35,392
But...

690
01:22:36,232 --> 01:22:38,832
the Mongol threat is not over.

691
01:22:41,992 --> 01:22:43,512
Since Ögedei Khan is dead,

692
01:22:44,232 --> 01:22:47,472
the peace agreement with him
means nothing.

693
01:22:50,192 --> 01:22:53,192
The Mongols will attack Anatolia again.

694
01:22:54,312 --> 01:23:00,072
Just as we defeated all threats so far
by standing united,

695
01:23:01,272 --> 01:23:04,712
God willing, we'll beat the Mongols too.

696
01:23:05,032 --> 01:23:06,952
God willing.

697
01:23:10,512 --> 01:23:14,312
We're on a new and holy path.

698
01:23:15,192 --> 01:23:20,712
When, God willing, we settle in Söğüt,
we'll grow even larger.

699
01:23:20,832 --> 01:23:22,112
God willing.

700
01:23:24,952 --> 01:23:28,512
We escaped many troubles so far.

701
01:23:30,152 --> 01:23:32,232
We fought many enemies.

702
01:23:34,832 --> 01:23:38,392
Our path is not limited to Söğüt.

703
01:23:40,472 --> 01:23:45,712
Just as we came here all the way
from our old homeland,

704
01:23:46,752 --> 01:23:51,712
we will spread in the whole world
from Söğüt.

705
01:23:51,872 --> 01:23:55,432
-God willing.
-God willing, my Bey.

706
01:23:59,832 --> 01:24:02,672
It's said that horses are fast,

707
01:24:03,312 --> 01:24:05,152
and the bard's tongue is talented.

708
01:24:06,432 --> 01:24:09,072
Sing us something from our ancestors,

709
01:24:09,632 --> 01:24:11,232
to entertain us, bard.

710
01:24:11,592 --> 01:24:12,592
All right.

711
01:24:28,432 --> 01:24:31,792
<i>The Khan's tent is raised</i>

712
01:24:31,912 --> 01:24:35,152
<i>The drums are playing</i>

713
01:24:35,232 --> 01:24:38,472
<i>The Khan's tent is raised</i>

714
01:24:38,592 --> 01:24:41,712
<i>The drums are playing</i>

715
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:45,152
<i>The enemy is crushed</i>

716
01:24:45,272 --> 01:24:48,272
<i>Oh how they run away</i>

717
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,752
<i>The enemy is crushed</i>

718
01:24:51,912 --> 01:24:54,672
<i>Oh how they run away</i>

719
01:25:01,512 --> 01:25:04,592
<i>Anger consumed me</i>

720
01:25:04,832 --> 01:25:07,912
<i>I roared like a lion</i>

721
01:25:08,112 --> 01:25:11,192
<i>Anger consumed me</i>

722
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:14,192
<i>I roared like a lion</i>

723
01:25:14,512 --> 01:25:17,632
<i>I cut down the head Alp</i>

724
01:25:17,752 --> 01:25:20,672
<i>Who can hold me back now</i>

725
01:25:20,872 --> 01:25:23,992
<i>I cut down the head Alp</i>

726
01:25:24,192 --> 01:25:26,992
<i>Who can hold me back now</i>

727
01:25:39,992 --> 01:25:43,072
<i>Alps fight bravely</i>

728
01:25:43,192 --> 01:25:46,072
<i>Their swords are strong</i>

729
01:25:46,472 --> 01:25:49,672
<i>Alps fight bravely</i>

730
01:25:49,792 --> 01:25:52,792
<i>Their swords are strong</i>

731
01:25:52,992 --> 01:25:56,152
<i>They help each other</i>

732
01:25:56,272 --> 01:25:59,112
<i>Their arrows don't miss</i>

733
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:02,512
<i>They help each other</i>

734
01:26:02,632 --> 01:26:05,792
<i>Their arrows don't miss</i>

735
01:26:12,404 --> 01:26:15,472
<i>Anger consumed me</i>

736
01:26:15,632 --> 01:26:18,592
<i>I roared like a lion</i>

737
01:26:18,872 --> 01:26:21,832
<i>Anger consumed me</i>

738
01:26:22,072 --> 01:26:25,112
<i>I roared like a lion</i>

739
01:26:25,272 --> 01:26:28,312
<i>I cut down the head Alp</i>

740
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:31,352
<i>Who can hold me back now</i>

741
01:26:31,552 --> 01:26:34,592
<i>I cut down the head Alp</i>

742
01:26:34,712 --> 01:26:37,632
<i>Who can hold me back now</i>

743
01:26:37,872 --> 01:26:41,112
<i>I cut down the head Alp</i>

744
01:26:41,192 --> 01:26:43,832
<i>Who can hold me back now</i>

745
01:26:44,272 --> 01:26:47,312
<i>I cut down the head Alp</i>

746
01:26:47,472 --> 01:26:51,592
<i>Who can hold me back now</i>

747
01:27:03,152 --> 01:27:04,392
<i>Alangoya...</i>

748
01:27:05,992 --> 01:27:07,392
Did you see Ertuğrul?

749
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:13,592
I manipulated his honesty and honor
and got a place in his bazaar.

750
01:27:14,992 --> 01:27:16,552
He trusts me.

751
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:20,912
I evet met his mother and wife
in their tent.

752
01:27:54,992 --> 01:27:57,952
You took all that I held dear, Ertuğrul.

753
01:28:00,352 --> 01:28:01,752
Now it's my turn.

754
01:28:05,032 --> 01:28:06,032
Wait for me.

755
01:28:08,672 --> 01:28:09,672
I'll come.

756
01:28:12,312 --> 01:28:14,112
I'll bring dark spirits.

757
01:28:16,312 --> 01:28:18,512
I'll end your line...

758
01:28:20,152 --> 01:28:23,392
and I'll make myself a tent
with the skin of your children.

759
01:28:25,912 --> 01:28:29,512
I will trample on their corpses.

760
01:28:31,512 --> 01:28:32,832
Wait for me Ertuğrul.

761
01:28:34,472 --> 01:28:35,472
Wait.

762
01:29:07,832 --> 01:29:09,112
Chief Alp Bamsı.

763
01:29:09,432 --> 01:29:11,552
You mentioned the Templars.

764
01:29:12,272 --> 01:29:14,192
How did you beat them?

765
01:29:16,632 --> 01:29:17,632
Gündüz Bey.

766
01:29:17,912 --> 01:29:20,312
We were surrounded.

767
01:29:20,512 --> 01:29:24,752
The Templar infidels were everywhere,
like trees,

768
01:29:25,232 --> 01:29:27,632
but we were like fire.

769
01:29:27,752 --> 01:29:32,512
With our steel-like faith
and our courage,

770
01:29:32,712 --> 01:29:38,552
our strong wrists
and our armor-piercing swords,

771
01:29:38,752 --> 01:29:40,472
we beat them all.

772
01:29:44,832 --> 01:29:47,632
How did we come so far, Father?

773
01:29:51,112 --> 01:29:56,952
When my father Suleyman Shah died,
we set off with those who believed in us.

774
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:37,872
That's how, Gündüz.

775
01:30:38,632 --> 01:30:42,392
It was hard to leave your brothers, right?

776
01:30:44,112 --> 01:30:45,392
Of course, Gündüz.

777
01:30:45,912 --> 01:30:46,912
Of course.

778
01:30:52,312 --> 01:30:55,792
Those were the most painful,
most difficult days of my life.

779
01:30:56,752 --> 01:30:59,592
Father, you encountered many difficulties.

780
01:31:02,312 --> 01:31:04,672
That's right, Gündüz.

781
01:31:05,632 --> 01:31:08,072
But those were all tests.

782
01:31:08,632 --> 01:31:11,632
We are on God's path,

783
01:31:13,272 --> 01:31:16,192
so, God helped us in our hard days.

784
01:31:19,472 --> 01:31:21,552
Thankfully, we managed to come here.

785
01:31:22,272 --> 01:31:24,872
-Thankfully.
-Thankfully.

786
01:31:27,312 --> 01:31:29,632
Tomorrow, the migration caravan
goes before us.

787
01:31:31,632 --> 01:31:34,632
We'll visit the graveyard

788
01:31:35,152 --> 01:31:37,992
and catch up with the caravan
at the Yellow Valley.

789
01:31:41,112 --> 01:31:44,912
From there, we'll all get to Söğüt,
God willing.

790
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:47,792
-As you order, my Bey.
-As you order, my Bey.

791
01:31:47,952 --> 01:31:50,712
-As you order, my Bey.
-Thank you, men.

792
01:31:54,912 --> 01:31:56,392
Come now, Gündüz.

793
01:31:56,552 --> 01:31:57,552
Time for bed.

794
01:31:57,832 --> 01:31:59,272
As you order, my Bey.

795
01:32:01,592 --> 01:32:02,592
Come on, alps.

796
01:32:04,752 --> 01:32:06,512
Praise your name, God.

797
01:32:25,872 --> 01:32:26,872
Son.

798
01:32:37,712 --> 01:32:38,712
My Ertuğrul...

799
01:32:39,712 --> 01:32:42,432
Do you think that scum Noyan
is gone for good?

800
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:46,312
Will he leave us?

801
01:32:48,152 --> 01:32:50,312
Noyan will never give up.

802
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,352
He'll come again.

803
01:32:55,872 --> 01:33:00,432
But this time with his army
to invade Anatolia.

804
01:33:02,032 --> 01:33:03,192
What will we do?

805
01:33:04,992 --> 01:33:07,872
We'll do whatever we did so far, mother.

806
01:33:10,672 --> 01:33:14,432
Do no evil, and never bow to evil.

807
01:33:17,632 --> 01:33:20,752
Even if he brings all the armies
of the world,

808
01:33:23,192 --> 01:33:24,472
we either win...

809
01:33:25,832 --> 01:33:27,752
or we die with honor, Mother.

810
01:33:31,432 --> 01:33:33,312
We encountered many troubles.

811
01:33:34,432 --> 01:33:36,592
We endured many calamities.

812
01:33:38,472 --> 01:33:44,072
But the pain this scum caused
feels like it was yesterday.

813
01:33:46,472 --> 01:33:49,152
I'm scared of seeing the same things.

814
01:33:52,272 --> 01:33:56,472
And of him attacking our children.

815
01:33:59,632 --> 01:34:00,632
Oh God.

816
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:04,032
Don't make us suffer those things again.

817
01:34:06,472 --> 01:34:08,072
Rest assured, Mother.

818
01:34:09,272 --> 01:34:10,512
If he comes...

819
01:34:11,592 --> 01:34:13,272
he'll get what he deserves.

820
01:34:17,232 --> 01:34:21,072
We'll take all the precautions at Söğüt.

821
01:34:21,472 --> 01:34:22,832
I hope so, Ertuğrul.

822
01:34:25,512 --> 01:34:28,872
Now, God willing, we'll migrate
to Söğüt.

823
01:34:31,192 --> 01:34:32,552
We lost our loved ones

824
01:34:33,352 --> 01:34:35,072
on this holy path.

825
01:34:36,272 --> 01:34:40,152
My Suleyman Shah died.

826
01:34:41,712 --> 01:34:44,072
We were separated from your brothers.

827
01:34:47,672 --> 01:34:50,632
My Halime. My dear.

828
01:34:54,232 --> 01:34:56,432
We buried her here.

829
01:35:00,312 --> 01:35:01,752
We endured all this pain...

830
01:35:03,032 --> 01:35:04,472
and never gave up.

831
01:35:06,632 --> 01:35:08,672
It was all for this day.

832
01:35:10,392 --> 01:35:12,592
I wish they could have seen this too.

833
01:35:14,752 --> 01:35:19,232
The pain I feel for them burns my heart,
Mother.

834
01:35:22,752 --> 01:35:26,232
But the holy path is full of tests.

835
01:35:28,792 --> 01:35:32,112
The pain for our loved ones was a test.

836
01:35:34,432 --> 01:35:40,552
We carried on, endured the pain,
with the help of God.

837
01:35:44,512 --> 01:35:48,752
Our efforts were rewarded
with God's favor.

838
01:35:53,032 --> 01:35:56,312
Now, Söğüt will be our home, Mother.

839
01:35:58,672 --> 01:36:03,072
God willing, the flame we'll lit
in Söğüt with mercy and justice

840
01:36:04,312 --> 01:36:08,632
will be carried everywhere in
the world by our children.

841
01:36:13,152 --> 01:36:15,872
God willing, son.

842
01:36:18,792 --> 01:36:20,472
I'll check on the children.

843
01:36:22,192 --> 01:36:23,272
Farewell, son.

844
01:37:01,032 --> 01:37:02,032
My Gündüz...

845
01:37:05,192 --> 01:37:06,512
My first boy.

846
01:37:26,712 --> 01:37:27,712
My Savcı...

847
01:37:42,392 --> 01:37:43,392
My Savcı...

848
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:46,552
Face white like milk...

849
01:37:48,432 --> 01:37:49,912
eyes blue like the sky.

850
01:37:56,192 --> 01:37:57,552
Go to sleep, son.

851
01:37:59,392 --> 01:38:00,432
Sleep, son.

852
01:38:19,752 --> 01:38:20,752
My Osman...

853
01:38:30,792 --> 01:38:31,792
My Osman...

854
01:38:33,232 --> 01:38:34,232
My promised son.

855
01:38:36,512 --> 01:38:37,512
Brave like a lion.

856
01:38:38,672 --> 01:38:39,912
Eyes like a wolf.

857
01:38:43,472 --> 01:38:46,232
You were promised in holy dreams.

858
01:38:47,992 --> 01:38:51,032
Took your name from my father,
Suleyman Shah.

859
01:38:52,232 --> 01:38:54,992
You were born during the spring council.

860
01:38:55,752 --> 01:38:56,752
God willing...

861
01:38:57,952 --> 01:39:00,792
you'll grow up with Söğüt as your home.

862
01:39:03,672 --> 01:39:07,712
At one side, may you have strong,
and brave warriors,

863
01:39:09,192 --> 01:39:13,192
and at the other side,
angels saying prayers.

864
01:39:16,712 --> 01:39:18,312
May armies follow you.

865
01:39:19,752 --> 01:39:22,072
May you lead holy wars.

866
01:39:23,032 --> 01:39:24,032
Oh son...

867
01:39:24,952 --> 01:39:27,552
May you carry the fire of Söğüt...

868
01:39:28,432 --> 01:39:31,912
from far east to far west.

869
01:39:33,472 --> 01:39:37,432
May the seas and rivers be yours.

870
01:39:41,032 --> 01:39:44,552
May the blue sky be your tent,
and the sun be your banner.

871
01:39:45,392 --> 01:39:48,912
May your only goal be God's favor, son.

872
01:41:52,072 --> 01:41:53,072
Mother...

873
01:41:53,712 --> 01:41:57,592
My brothers and I miss you.

874
01:41:59,712 --> 01:42:01,872
We miss your warmth.

875
01:42:05,672 --> 01:42:07,912
Now we go to our new home.

876
01:42:08,432 --> 01:42:10,752
Don't worry.

877
01:42:11,312 --> 01:42:15,472
I'll look after my brothers
like a good big brother.

878
01:42:22,312 --> 01:42:25,992
We'll come visit you.

879
01:42:30,872 --> 01:42:35,192
You wanted us all to be great beys.

880
01:42:38,032 --> 01:42:39,512
I swear, Mother.

881
01:42:40,192 --> 01:42:45,552
We'll be beys worthy of you and Father.

882
01:42:53,712 --> 01:42:54,912
Mother...

883
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,152
My Gündüz...

884
01:43:16,432 --> 01:43:17,432
My brave son...

885
01:43:18,752 --> 01:43:19,752
Come on...

886
01:43:20,752 --> 01:43:21,952
Time to go.

887
01:43:23,432 --> 01:43:24,432
Come.

888
01:43:25,992 --> 01:43:26,992
Gündüz...

889
01:43:28,032 --> 01:43:29,032
Come.

890
01:43:37,632 --> 01:43:38,632
Oh dear.

891
01:43:42,232 --> 01:43:43,232
Come.

892
01:43:57,032 --> 01:43:58,032
My Halime...

893
01:44:00,752 --> 01:44:02,672
My brave wife with beautiful eyes.

894
01:44:06,952 --> 01:44:09,232
I miss you so much.

895
01:44:12,752 --> 01:44:14,232
It burns me.

896
01:44:22,112 --> 01:44:24,992
It's time to go to Söğüt, Halime.

897
01:44:28,192 --> 01:44:30,752
It's time to light the flame at Söğüt,

898
01:44:32,232 --> 01:44:36,032
that we dreamed of for such a long time.

899
01:44:40,072 --> 01:44:41,792
Don't worry, Halime.

900
01:44:44,832 --> 01:44:46,312
Rest in peace.

901
01:44:49,752 --> 01:44:52,832
I'll raise our sons to be worthy

902
01:44:53,832 --> 01:44:59,152
of their fathers' blood
and their mothers' milk.

903
01:45:01,232 --> 01:45:02,432
Rest assured.

904
01:45:07,592 --> 01:45:09,512
I loved you, Halime.

905
01:45:11,592 --> 01:45:13,392
May God bless you.

906
01:45:16,672 --> 01:45:17,912
May you rest in heaven.

907
01:45:21,072 --> 01:45:23,392
I hope that God...

908
01:45:24,352 --> 01:45:28,672
in the name of our Prophet,

909
01:45:29,432 --> 01:45:31,352
unites us in the afterlife as well.

910
01:46:29,352 --> 01:46:32,632
We prayed for our fallen and
watered their graves.

911
01:46:34,272 --> 01:46:35,752
Well done.

912
01:46:36,232 --> 01:46:37,232
Well done.

913
01:46:38,312 --> 01:46:39,432
Today, our cause...

914
01:46:41,712 --> 01:46:43,312
is their legacy.

915
01:46:47,432 --> 01:46:49,232
May God send them to heaven.

916
01:46:49,632 --> 01:46:50,632
Amen.

917
01:46:51,632 --> 01:46:55,032
May our unity prevail in Söğüt.

918
01:46:55,832 --> 01:46:57,752
Amen, my Bey.

919
01:46:58,272 --> 01:46:59,272
Come on.

920
01:47:00,472 --> 01:47:02,192
Time to go.

921
01:47:16,672 --> 01:47:19,072
<i>-Selamunaleykum.</i>
<i>-Aleykumselamun.</i>

922
01:47:21,832 --> 01:47:22,912
Welcome.

923
01:47:23,352 --> 01:47:24,352
Thank you.

924
01:48:05,632 --> 01:48:07,272
We, the Mongols...

925
01:48:08,392 --> 01:48:10,872
are Tengri's punishment on Earth.

926
01:48:11,752 --> 01:48:13,832
If the Turks had obeyed...

927
01:48:14,792 --> 01:48:20,112
If they weren't so proud...

928
01:48:21,992 --> 01:48:25,552
Tengri wouldn't send us against them.

929
01:48:26,032 --> 01:48:29,072
Noyan, our flesh and blood are yours.

930
01:48:29,232 --> 01:48:30,432
Yours!

931
01:48:33,432 --> 01:48:34,432
Now...

932
01:48:36,352 --> 01:48:39,872
We're going to invade Anatolia.

933
01:48:41,112 --> 01:48:43,072
At last, the Turks will lose.

934
01:48:44,032 --> 01:48:48,912
They'll pay for not obeying me, Noyan.

935
01:48:50,712 --> 01:48:54,952
I know that you're loyal to me
until death.

936
01:48:56,512 --> 01:48:58,072
But that's not enough.

937
01:49:00,352 --> 01:49:04,632
Even if I rot in the Gobi Desert,

938
01:49:05,232 --> 01:49:07,792
you won't give up.

939
01:49:09,792 --> 01:49:13,832
You are my bravest commanders.

940
01:49:16,152 --> 01:49:19,592
When we enter Anatolia,

941
01:49:20,472 --> 01:49:23,192
The Turks will stand like a wall
against us.

942
01:49:24,592 --> 01:49:27,552
But the strength of this wall

943
01:49:28,432 --> 01:49:30,912
depends on the courage of its defenders.

944
01:49:32,832 --> 01:49:35,552
First, we'll break their courage.

945
01:49:36,112 --> 01:49:38,032
With our spies everywhere...

946
01:49:39,552 --> 01:49:42,752
with the traps of our loyal men...

947
01:49:43,912 --> 01:49:46,552
we'll paint Anatolia in blood.

948
01:49:49,192 --> 01:49:53,672
We'll set the Turks against each other...

949
01:49:55,552 --> 01:49:59,592
and we'll collect their heads
like pears from a tree.

950
01:50:03,432 --> 01:50:09,352
The greatest happiness for a warrior
is to be victorious.

951
01:50:12,712 --> 01:50:13,992
To track them down,

952
01:50:15,312 --> 01:50:16,552
to beat them,

953
01:50:17,512 --> 01:50:21,992
to take their goods and loved ones.

954
01:50:26,232 --> 01:50:27,232
Then, we shall...

955
01:50:28,672 --> 01:50:33,272
drink kumis on the Seljuks' broken table

956
01:50:34,152 --> 01:50:35,592
and get drunk.

957
01:50:38,152 --> 01:50:39,912
We'll celebrate our victory.

958
01:50:42,032 --> 01:50:44,312
May the spirits be with us.

959
01:50:45,712 --> 01:50:49,632
Noyan! Noyan!

960
01:50:56,672 --> 01:50:58,312
You traveled on many hard roads.

961
01:51:00,192 --> 01:51:02,112
You lost loved ones.

962
01:51:02,792 --> 01:51:05,112
You lost alps in battle.

963
01:51:07,352 --> 01:51:10,352
But, with unshaken determination...

964
01:51:11,672 --> 01:51:15,152
and the faith in your heart,
you didn't give up.

965
01:51:17,952 --> 01:51:20,792
You're dedicated to a holy cause.

966
01:51:22,672 --> 01:51:24,592
You adopted God's cause,

967
01:51:25,232 --> 01:51:27,512
and you hold it higher than anything else.

968
01:51:30,112 --> 01:51:35,192
Now, you're about to have great conquests,
God willing.

969
01:51:38,112 --> 01:51:42,192
My only wish from God is
that we can serve his cause

970
01:51:42,792 --> 01:51:44,992
to gain his favor.

971
01:51:47,232 --> 01:51:52,032
I'll try to bring justice, mercy and hope

972
01:51:52,312 --> 01:51:54,712
everywhere on earth until my last breath.

973
01:51:57,992 --> 01:52:00,912
Holy God says that:

974
01:52:01,712 --> 01:52:03,432
"The ones who have believed,

975
01:52:03,992 --> 01:52:06,672
emigrated and striven in the cause
of God...

976
01:52:08,392 --> 01:52:10,912
it is those who are the attainers
of success."

977
01:52:15,792 --> 01:52:18,192
God is merciful and forgiving.

978
01:52:20,792 --> 01:52:23,632
You set off on God's path for jihad.

979
01:52:26,072 --> 01:52:28,792
God willing, his favor will be upon you.

980
01:52:29,552 --> 01:52:31,232
-God willing.
-God willing.

981
01:52:31,312 --> 01:52:32,312
God willing.

982
01:52:34,912 --> 01:52:36,192
I hope that...

983
01:52:37,392 --> 01:52:39,952
you'll shine like the sun
in your new home...

984
01:52:41,032 --> 01:52:43,072
and enlighten the world.

985
01:52:45,152 --> 01:52:46,632
Now, time to say goodbye.

986
01:52:49,192 --> 01:52:51,752
I'll go to Konya with my brothers.

987
01:52:56,592 --> 01:52:58,192
We owe you.

988
01:52:59,552 --> 01:53:00,632
You guided us.

989
01:53:02,472 --> 01:53:05,392
You helped us escape the darkness.

990
01:53:07,152 --> 01:53:10,792
I'll never forget your support and help.

991
01:53:12,352 --> 01:53:13,832
We can't ever repay you.

992
01:53:15,152 --> 01:53:16,432
We thank you.

993
01:53:16,952 --> 01:53:18,272
God bless you.

994
01:53:19,032 --> 01:53:20,032
Ertuğrul Bey.

995
01:53:21,232 --> 01:53:25,032
You gave hope to the poor
and scared away the evil.

996
01:53:26,792 --> 01:53:28,832
You protected the innocent.

997
01:53:30,712 --> 01:53:33,672
Your goal is to serve God's cause.

998
01:53:35,672 --> 01:53:40,552
Our cause is to serve God's servants.

999
01:53:42,512 --> 01:53:43,832
Thank you.

1000
01:53:46,792 --> 01:53:48,712
Now, we go our separate ways.

1001
01:53:50,432 --> 01:53:53,912
But know that death is not goodbye.

1002
01:53:54,752 --> 01:53:57,272
There is no separation
for those who share one heart.

1003
01:53:59,592 --> 01:54:02,552
You'll always be in our hearts
and we'll pray for you.

1004
01:54:05,352 --> 01:54:07,672
Pray for this poor fellow.

1005
01:54:08,952 --> 01:54:09,952
Always.

1006
01:54:18,112 --> 01:54:22,232
I would love to hear your words again.

1007
01:54:23,632 --> 01:54:24,712
Farewell, son.

1008
01:54:26,872 --> 01:54:27,872
Thank you.

1009
01:54:49,352 --> 01:54:51,352
Gündüz... Son...

1010
01:54:53,352 --> 01:54:56,272
You grew up into a man.

1011
01:54:58,552 --> 01:55:01,472
You aren't Gündüz the baby,
but Gündüz Bey.

1012
01:55:03,992 --> 01:55:05,232
You have a duty too.

1013
01:55:06,832 --> 01:55:08,712
To look after your two brothers...

1014
01:55:10,192 --> 01:55:12,552
make them ride and swing a sword.

1015
01:55:14,232 --> 01:55:16,832
Make them brave beys like yourself.

1016
01:55:19,952 --> 01:55:21,992
Brothers are like arrows.

1017
01:55:23,912 --> 01:55:27,272
They're stronger when together.

1018
01:55:36,152 --> 01:55:39,672
I hope you'll be worthy of your father.

1019
01:55:41,312 --> 01:55:43,712
I won't forget your lessons, sir.

1020
01:55:44,992 --> 01:55:49,392
I'll be a good big brother to them.

1021
01:55:50,392 --> 01:55:54,112
We'll be worthy of our father.

1022
01:55:55,712 --> 01:55:56,712
I hope so.

1023
01:56:31,952 --> 01:56:33,592
Give us your blessing, sir.

1024
01:56:33,792 --> 01:56:34,992
You have it, son.

1025
01:56:35,432 --> 01:56:36,432
You have it.

1026
01:56:38,712 --> 01:56:40,912
God help you, alps.

1027
01:56:42,472 --> 01:56:43,792
God protect you.

1028
01:56:44,112 --> 01:56:46,232
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

1029
01:56:46,432 --> 01:56:47,472
Thank you.

1030
01:56:51,392 --> 01:56:52,392
Come on, alps.

1031
01:56:53,232 --> 01:56:55,032
We can't keep them waiting.

1032
01:56:56,472 --> 01:56:58,032
We have to go now.

1033
01:56:59,432 --> 01:57:00,432
Come on, men!

1034
01:57:52,312 --> 01:57:56,272
<i>Our way is the way to holy war.</i>

1035
01:57:57,432 --> 01:58:00,472
<i>We won't stop until our horses</i>
<i>reach the horizon,</i>

1036
01:58:01,232 --> 01:58:06,552
<i>and until we spread the justice of God</i>
<i>from the east to the west.</i>

1037
01:58:07,552 --> 01:58:09,112
Our destination is,

1038
01:58:09,512 --> 01:58:12,712
<i>the seven climates,</i>
<i>all the seas and rivers.</i>

1039
01:58:13,232 --> 01:58:17,392
<i>Our road is to the holiest goal,</i>
<i>it is the Red Apple.</i>

1040
01:58:21,752 --> 01:58:23,912
<i>Bismillahirahmanirrahim.</i>

1041
01:58:25,072 --> 01:58:29,712
<i>"Surely, we have given you</i>
<i>a conquest.</i>

1042
01:58:31,632 --> 01:58:33,072
<i>That God may forgive you</i>

1043
01:58:33,192 --> 01:58:36,632
<i>for what preceded of your sin</i>
<i>and what will follow</i>

1044
01:58:37,032 --> 01:58:39,672
<i>and complete His favor upon you.</i>

1045
01:58:39,992 --> 01:58:42,072
<i>and guide you to a straight path.</i>

1046
01:58:43,832 --> 01:58:48,992
<i>And that God may aid you</i>
<i>with a mighty victory.</i>

1047
01:58:49,672 --> 01:58:52,472
<i>It is He who sent down tranquility</i>
<i>into the hearts of the believers.</i>

1048
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:55,792
<i>He fills their hearts with faith</i>

1049
01:58:56,152 --> 01:58:58,752
<i>and makes them peaceful.</i>

1050
01:59:03,312 --> 01:59:06,472
<i>To God belong the soldiers</i>
<i>of the heavens and the earth,</i>

1051
01:59:07,032 --> 01:59:09,592
<i>and God is all knowing.</i>

1052
01:59:09,992 --> 01:59:12,472
<i>And God is Wise.</i>

1053
01:59:13,752 --> 01:59:18,152
<i>He may admit</i>
<i>the believing men and the believing women</i>

1054
01:59:18,432 --> 01:59:20,672
<i>to gardens beneath which rivers flow.</i>

1055
01:59:20,912 --> 01:59:24,552
<i>Those believers can go to heaven</i>
<i>and stay there forever</i>

1056
01:59:24,872 --> 01:59:28,032
<i>because God cleanses their hearts.</i>

1057
01:59:28,792 --> 01:59:33,512
<i>Before God, it is such a joy</i>
<i>to have this opportunity.</i>
