1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 114 will start after 12:30 min.

2
00:13:07,457 --> 00:13:08,897
What is this arrow?

3
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:28,417
Ertuğrul Bey!

4
00:13:29,857 --> 00:13:31,137
Who are you?

5
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:37,017
I bring greetings from Husamettin Karaca.

6
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:40,017
Husamettin Karaca?

7
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:49,817
Alps, be cautious.

8
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:16,657
-Whose blood is our right?
-The dog, Sadettin.

9
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:22,217
At ease, alps.

10
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:29,977
Where is Husamettin Karaca?

11
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:34,777
He's waiting for you in a cave
on Kargi Hill. It's important.

12
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,697
What could it be, Ertuğrul?

13
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:45,977
It must be important for Husamettin Karaca
to stop us in our tracks like this.

14
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,977
We should make our way there at once.

15
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:04,137
When we lay siege to the castle
we will pound the walls with catapults.

16
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:10,417
At night, our soldiers will howl
like wolves at the base of the walls,

17
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:13,337
beat drums and blow horns.

18
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:19,097
We will deprive them of their sleep
and their peace of mind.

19
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:22,497
They won't dare poke their heads
over the walls out of fear.

20
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,857
We will hold all the roads
that lead to the castle.

21
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:30,457
Not so much as a grain
of wheat will go in.

22
00:15:31,337 --> 00:15:35,937
Hunger and fear will force them
to surrender the castle to us.

23
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:38,017
What if they resist, Your Eminence?

24
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:43,537
If they resist, we will march
on them with all our might

25
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:45,817
and raze the castle to the ground.

26
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:49,017
Now go back to your troops.

27
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:52,817
Know that I won't tolerate
any mistakes before our victory.

28
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:54,937
-Yes, Your Eminence.
-Yes, Your Eminence.

29
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:17,617
<i>May I enter, Your Eminence?</i>

30
00:16:19,217 --> 00:16:20,337
Come Kayraldi, come.

31
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:27,897
Your Eminence.

32
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:31,337
I hope nothing's wrong at the camp.

33
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,297
Everything is in order
at the camp, Your Eminence.

34
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:36,657
However, I have important news from Konya.

35
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:38,137
What?

36
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:41,337
Sultan Giyaseddin
and his mother Mahperi Hatun...

37
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:44,817
have left the palace.

38
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:49,777
Left the palace? Where have they gone?

39
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:54,937
Unfortunately, nobody knows,
Your Eminence.

40
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:58,097
What do you mean, "Nobody knows"?
What about you?

41
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:00,777
Did I not say I wanted to be
kept informed of everything?

42
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:02,857
The sultan and his mother
leave the palace,

43
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:06,217
and you come here and tell me
you don't know where they went!

44
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,377
-Your Eminence--
-Silence!

45
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:16,057
Leaving the palace
without anyone knowing?

46
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:22,337
This does not bode well. Not at all.

47
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:42,577
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-I'm glad to see you, Husamettin.

48
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:45,577
What made you turn us from our road?

49
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:48,937
Come now.

50
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:05,337
My Sultan?

51
00:18:12,577 --> 00:18:13,577
Mahperi Hatun.

52
00:18:21,697 --> 00:18:24,777
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-I'm glad to see you, my Sultan.

53
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:26,577
Come, sit down.

54
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:44,057
You've disguised yourself, my Sultan.
Has something happened in Konya?

55
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:47,457
Not yet, Ertuğrul Bey. But it will, soon.

56
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:51,857
Sadettin Köpek has had everyone
who opposed him killed.

57
00:18:52,457 --> 00:18:54,817
He has taken control
of all positions of state,

58
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,577
from the army to the justice chamber.

59
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:02,257
We can't take a step in the castle without
him knowing. Everyone works for him.

60
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:06,617
Everyone's eyes are on us.

61
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:09,457
They look at us like executioners,
Ertuğrul Bey.

62
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:13,857
We had to leave in disguise
so that we could talk to you.

63
00:19:18,937 --> 00:19:21,737
If you don't crush the snake
growing beside you...

64
00:19:22,737 --> 00:19:24,577
you'll be the first one it bites.

65
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:32,337
Unfortunately, no one
recognizes a snake for what it is...

66
00:19:34,177 --> 00:19:35,817
until it poisons you.

67
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,417
If Sadettin is victorious at Samsat,

68
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:43,217
we'll be done for
before he reaches Konya.

69
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:47,537
We can't wait for Emir Sadettin
to get his victory at Samsat.

70
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:51,257
We need to finish him off
before he gets there.

71
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:55,577
It doesn't matter how big
that snake has become...

72
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:59,137
with God's permission, our swords
will be able to sever its head.

73
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:01,337
I don't doubt that, Ertuğrul Bey.

74
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:05,097
However, there's an important matter
you must take care of beforehand.

75
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:10,257
Command me, my Sultan. What is it?

76
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:13,457
Sadettin Köpek has taken
Emir Kamyeri captive.

77
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:25,017
Emir Kamyeri is extremely
important to the state.

78
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:29,377
If he has captured him,
he won't let him live.

79
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:36,097
He intends to kill the last
Emir still standing against him.

80
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:41,537
After he kills the powerful Emir Kamyeri,
no one will dare oppose him.

81
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:47,217
You know, Emir Kamyeri
has a formidable army loyal to him.

82
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:51,017
I know, Husamettin Bey, I know.

83
00:20:55,777 --> 00:20:59,137
If Emir Kamyeri dies,
Köpek will get a hold of his army.

84
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:04,777
His military forces will be unstoppable
and his power in the state absolute.

85
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,617
Emir Kamyeri must be saved before Köpek
has a chance to get his hands on him.

86
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:14,977
We must move at once.

87
00:21:27,297 --> 00:21:29,057
That sultan and his mother...

88
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,897
have set out to kill me.

89
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:40,737
Nothing can stand in the way...

90
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:44,217
of the glorious victory that awaits me!

91
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:48,617
Look here, Kayraldi.
Send your men out far and wide.

92
00:21:50,457 --> 00:21:53,857
The sultan and his mother must be found.

93
00:21:55,337 --> 00:22:00,377
If they return to the palace,
don't let them go anywhere

94
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:03,697
until I'm back in Konya.

95
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:07,897
Should we keep them prisoner
in the palace, Your Eminence?

96
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:11,137
Yes, we should.

97
00:22:13,257 --> 00:22:17,497
I cannot have them disturbing
my thoughts while I am out on campaign.

98
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:23,657
And when I get back,
I'll uproot this problem once and for all.

99
00:22:26,297 --> 00:22:27,777
Any word on Emir Kamyeri?

100
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:30,537
He was caught and arrested,
Your Eminence.

101
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:33,297
They're bringing him to you.
He'll be here tomorrow.

102
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:35,817
Good.

103
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:41,137
Let him come.

104
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:46,737
I will behead him myself.

105
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:50,497
He must be dealt with
before I set out for Samsat.

106
00:22:50,857 --> 00:22:54,177
He must be dealt with
so that I can take his army.

107
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:58,937
Have his possessions confiscated
and added to my treasure.

108
00:22:59,817 --> 00:23:01,377
As you wish, Your Eminence.

109
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:08,697
A famous conquest awaits us, Kayraldi.
A great one.

110
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,137
When I take Samsat Castle...

111
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:17,457
I'll pile the heads of my enemies high...

112
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:24,177
and sit my throne atop them.

113
00:23:29,897 --> 00:23:33,497
My scouts tell me that the soldiers
escorting Emir Kamyeri

114
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:35,337
have passed Yilanli Mountain.

115
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:38,977
That means they'll reach Köpek's
camp tomorrow evening.

116
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:44,537
We have to get going at once.

117
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:51,337
We'll carry out the raid at first light
and rescue Emir Kamyeri, God willing.

118
00:23:58,177 --> 00:23:59,737
And we should get back to Konya.

119
00:24:00,137 --> 00:24:03,097
My Sultan, they'll know by now
that you left the palace.

120
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:07,017
It's too dangerous for you
to go back to Konya.

121
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:12,097
They won't let you leave the palace again.

122
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,617
What should we do then, Ertuğrul Bey?

123
00:24:15,657 --> 00:24:18,497
It would be best if you
didn't return for the time being.

124
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:24,297
My Sultan, Sultan Alaeddin
was poisoned right in front of my eyes.

125
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:27,417
Shahzade Kilicarslan died in my arms.

126
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:32,217
I can't let you return
to what would be certain death.

127
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:36,217
So what do we do?

128
00:24:39,337 --> 00:24:42,977
If you will consider it,
I'd like you to go to my tribe.

129
00:24:43,257 --> 00:24:46,017
-Your tribe?
-My tribe, my Sultan.

130
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:53,017
You will be safer with my tribe
than at the palace.

131
00:24:53,817 --> 00:24:57,457
You will be the guests of my tribe
until the Köpek threat is dealt with.

132
00:25:00,057 --> 00:25:01,697
You are right, Ertuğrul Bey.

133
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,817
-Bamsı.
-Yes, my Bey.

134
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:08,937
Take Dumrul, Meliksah,
Abdurrahman and Oguz with you.

135
00:25:10,257 --> 00:25:12,657
Get our Sultan
and Mahperi Hatun to the tribe.

136
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:18,377
You know the shortcuts and hidden paths.
Take those roads.

137
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:21,057
I know them, my Bey. As you command.

138
00:25:23,137 --> 00:25:24,737
I'll get the horses ready.

139
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:27,177
-God speed.
-Thank you.

140
00:25:31,937 --> 00:25:33,377
This is a wise move, Ertuğrul Bey.

141
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:37,417
But I am uneasy
at leaving my palace behind.

142
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:43,897
My Sultan, traitors lurk
in the palace like ghouls.

143
00:25:44,937 --> 00:25:46,657
That place is a prison for you now.

144
00:25:51,297 --> 00:25:53,177
When we do away with the traitors...

145
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:59,337
you will once again
shine in your palace like the sun.

146
00:26:03,177 --> 00:26:06,977
I too left my tribe and my family
behind when I embarked on this mission.

147
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:12,657
We all have to shoulder our duty
until we rid our state of these traitors.

148
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:20,537
Be reassured by the knowledge that

149
00:26:20,617 --> 00:26:22,777
you're doing this
for the good of our state.

150
00:26:27,537 --> 00:26:29,017
All right, Ertuğrul Bey.

151
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:35,297
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.
May your sword be sharp.

152
00:26:37,457 --> 00:26:39,137
Godspeed, my Sultan.

153
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:51,097
Come on, my brave men.

154
00:26:53,617 --> 00:26:57,017
{\an8}It's time for us to move.
Battle awaits us at daybreak.

155
00:27:28,657 --> 00:27:29,937
May your work be easy.

156
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:34,297
-Thank you, Halime Hatun.
-Thank you, Halime Hatun.

157
00:27:34,377 --> 00:27:36,777
-May your work be easy.
-Thank you.

158
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:37,857
Good luck.

159
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,377
Look at what she's carrying.

160
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:56,177
Alçiçek, take those jars off her.

161
00:27:57,937 --> 00:28:01,377
-Let me, Hafsa Hatun.
-Alçiçek, I'm fine. Thank you.

162
00:28:02,737 --> 00:28:03,577
Here.

163
00:28:06,137 --> 00:28:08,817
How many times have I told you
not to carry heavy things?

164
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:11,017
You could hurt the child in your belly.

165
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:16,577
You keep working as if you don't already
have enough of a burden to carry!

166
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:19,697
Come here, come and sit down.

167
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:26,257
Alçiçek, bring Hafsa some water.
She needs to rest.

168
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:33,057
Halime Hatun, I'm not able to help you
in the rug house because of the baby,

169
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:35,577
at least let me help you
by bringing you water.

170
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:39,377
Hafsa, if I told Mother about this
she'd be furious.

171
00:28:39,697 --> 00:28:43,657
She'd say, "Are you trying
to harm my grandson?"

172
00:28:47,177 --> 00:28:48,617
Here, Hafsa Hatun.

173
00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:51,137
Thank you, Alçiçek.

174
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:00,937
Thank you.

175
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:11,697
Why is that rug not finished?

176
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:20,377
It was Aslıhan Hatun's.

177
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:25,497
Half-finished.

178
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:32,017
Whenever I try to complete it,

179
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,257
my hands shake...

180
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:37,177
and my heart aches.

181
00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:44,377
It will remain unfinished,
like her life, like her happiness.

182
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:55,297
But our beys will exact revenge
on the one who did this to her, Hafsa.

183
00:29:56,457 --> 00:30:00,777
The one who cut her down
in the spring of her life will perish.

184
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:06,217
We should think of our children.

185
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:11,697
I have two in my tent
and one growing inside me.

186
00:30:12,537 --> 00:30:14,617
And yours will be here soon.

187
00:30:20,377 --> 00:30:23,177
God willing,
our beys will come back safe to us.

188
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:28,897
I beg God that they get the chance
to kiss and embrace their children.

189
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:31,857
God willing, Hafsa. God willing.

190
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:39,377
They travel a difficult path
not just for their own children,

191
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:46,537
but for the children of all our kin,
and for those who will come after.

192
00:30:50,257 --> 00:30:52,417
May god grant them speed.

193
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:54,297
Amen.

194
00:30:56,177 --> 00:30:57,777
I'm going to check the rugs.

195
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,257
Hafsa Hatun!

196
00:31:26,897 --> 00:31:27,817
Hafsa!

197
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:30,537
Halime!

198
00:31:31,937 --> 00:31:33,217
Bring water, Alçiçek!

199
00:31:35,457 --> 00:31:36,937
Hafsa? Sister?

200
00:31:38,417 --> 00:31:39,617
Hafsa!

201
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:41,857
Hafsa, wake up.

202
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:43,377
Bring water!

203
00:31:43,457 --> 00:31:45,177
-God save her.
-Sister!

204
00:31:46,377 --> 00:31:49,217
Hafsa? Hafsa, my sister?

205
00:31:49,817 --> 00:31:52,857
My God, my God, help her. Hafsa!

206
00:31:53,017 --> 00:31:54,617
Wake up, Hafsa Hatun.

207
00:31:54,737 --> 00:31:58,297
Hafsa? Sister! Hafsa!

208
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:16,377
-May I enter, my bey?
-Come.

209
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:21,457
Any word on Ertuğrul?

210
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:27,697
We've been watching the tribe closely.
But there's no sign of Ertuğrul.

211
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:34,897
Where are you, Ertuğrul?

212
00:32:47,337 --> 00:32:51,577
We should confront them, my bey.
Frighten him into returning.

213
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:54,337
We could even take Hanlı Bazaar from them.
What's stopping us?

214
00:32:54,817 --> 00:32:58,297
-They'd be so scared they'd obey.
-How many times must I say this, Aydoğmus?

215
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:02,017
Ertuğrul took Hanlı Bazaar
by the right of his sword.

216
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:05,417
It would go against our laws
to usurp that right.

217
00:33:06,697 --> 00:33:11,097
It belongs to the Kayi.
It provides them with a living.

218
00:33:13,657 --> 00:33:16,697
-Then the tribe--
-We'll not touch the tribe, either.

219
00:33:17,777 --> 00:33:20,937
The innocent should not be made
to suffer because of Ertuğrul.

220
00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:45,257
You think this is the way to treat an emir
who has dedicated his life to his state?

221
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:57,057
You'll pay a heavy price for this.

222
00:33:58,617 --> 00:33:59,777
Be silent!

223
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:08,937
You'll be free of this torture
once you're put to death.

224
00:34:25,537 --> 00:34:27,217
God, give me patience!

225
00:35:04,097 --> 00:35:05,017
Emir Kamyeri.

226
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:45,817
We'll take down the two men
on either side of him first.

227
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:52,417
Then we'll draw our swords
and tear them apart.

228
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:23,737
We're being attacked!

229
00:36:31,577 --> 00:36:33,257
God is infinite!

230
00:37:20,497 --> 00:37:23,937
-Will you tell me your name?
-Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

231
00:37:25,137 --> 00:37:26,657
So, you're the bey of the Kayi.

232
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:29,777
May God bless you.

233
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:32,257
You're welcome.

234
00:37:35,617 --> 00:37:38,897
The life of any man who is loyal
to the state is important to us.

235
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,737
And at times like this,
when there are traitors everywhere,

236
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:44,777
we can't allow
a single good man to be lost.

237
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:58,697
Husamettin Karaca.

238
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:01,737
If you hadn't arrived,
those bastards would've killed me.

239
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:05,337
As long as that traitor Sadettin Köpek
is around to pull their strings,

240
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,417
-we must stand united.
-You're right.

241
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:12,937
First, we must get you free
of these chains.

242
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:49,137
My loyal friend, Ares.

243
00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:53,697
-Welcome.
-Governor Kritos.

244
00:38:54,857 --> 00:38:57,577
-Thank you.
-Sit down.

245
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,937
It's good to see you again.

246
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:07,297
I hope you've brought
good news from Nicaea.

247
00:39:08,177 --> 00:39:10,537
It happened exactly
as I thought it would, Kritos.

248
00:39:10,897 --> 00:39:13,817
The emperor agreed to give you an army.

249
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:18,577
As soon as the army is ready,
it will depart.

250
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,737
God save the emperor!

251
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,817
We'll finally be able to throw
the Turks out of this land.

252
00:39:28,097 --> 00:39:33,217
Ares, with this army, we can take
not only Söğüt but Karacahisar as well.

253
00:39:44,937 --> 00:39:47,737
Sir, if you'll excuse me.

254
00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:15,377
Meet Emir Sadettin on his way to Samsat

255
00:40:15,777 --> 00:40:18,817
and persuade him to settle his
cantonment in Sivas, Husamettin Bey.

256
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:22,937
As Emir Sadettin's guest,

257
00:40:23,457 --> 00:40:26,137
you can then pass us
information about his army.

258
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:29,697
Then we'll move.

259
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:34,177
When Sadettin is with you in his tent,
we'll attack and bring him down.

260
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:40,857
Husamettin, you know
Sadettin doesn't trust you or Togan Bey.

261
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:50,537
Husamettin Karaca
will tell Sadettin that he killed you.

262
00:40:50,977 --> 00:40:52,977
And that he'll obey him.

263
00:40:56,177 --> 00:40:57,617
How can I, Ertuğrul Bey?

264
00:40:59,377 --> 00:41:03,297
You'll tell him Emir Kamyeri sought refuge
with you after escaping, Husamettin Bey.

265
00:41:04,017 --> 00:41:06,777
You'll tell him you carried
out the execution personally,

266
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,897
fulfilling the death warrant
Emir Sadettin had issued.

267
00:41:14,017 --> 00:41:15,657
How will I prove it?

268
00:41:18,257 --> 00:41:23,817
You'll give Emir Sadettin
Emir Kamyeri's cap and ring.

269
00:41:41,377 --> 00:41:45,857
Good thinking, Ertuğrul Bey.
Sadettin will certainly recognize my ring.

270
00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:48,937
It'll be easy for Husamettin
to convince him.

271
00:41:50,937 --> 00:41:52,337
Once you've won Köpek's trust,

272
00:41:52,497 --> 00:41:54,457
you'll pass on to us
what you've discovered.

273
00:41:55,657 --> 00:41:57,257
I'll do whatever's necessary,
Ertuğrul Bey.

274
00:41:57,337 --> 00:41:58,417
Thank you.

275
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:01,617
Our enemy is wicked
and your task difficult.

276
00:42:02,017 --> 00:42:04,137
May God help you, brave men.

277
00:42:05,377 --> 00:42:08,017
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

278
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:14,777
It's a war between the tyrannical
and the oppressed, God and superstition,

279
00:42:15,177 --> 00:42:17,097
treachery and loyalty.

280
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,497
May God help us all.

281
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:23,817
-Amen.
-Amen.

282
00:43:34,617 --> 00:43:38,977
<i>Your Eminence,</i>
<i>Günalp Bey has disobeyed your orders</i>

283
00:43:39,057 --> 00:43:42,737
<i>and refuses to take any action</i>
<i>against the Kayi tribe.</i>

284
00:43:43,977 --> 00:43:47,897
<i>As a result, we have found</i>
<i>no trace of Ertuğrul Bey.</i>

285
00:43:48,937 --> 00:43:53,137
<i>If I advance on the Kayi,</i>
<i>I may learn Ertuğrul's location.</i>

286
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:56,697
<i>But Günalp Bey will not allow this.</i>

287
00:43:57,297 --> 00:44:02,457
<i>To find Ertuğrul, you will have</i>
<i>to put Günalp Bey out of action.</i>

288
00:44:03,537 --> 00:44:07,937
<i>I look forward to receiving your orders.</i>
<i>Your loyal servant, Aydoğmus.</i>

289
00:45:17,977 --> 00:45:19,217
Your Eminence.

290
00:45:42,737 --> 00:45:45,017
You thought our Seljuk state...

291
00:45:48,057 --> 00:45:51,057
was weak just because...

292
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:56,057
a young sultan had ascended the throne.

293
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:01,337
You rebelled against our state.

294
00:46:03,617 --> 00:46:04,937
Well...

295
00:46:05,737 --> 00:46:10,977
you never stopped to consider
the wrath of Sadettin Köpek, did you?

296
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,817
Did you really think
you could get away with it?

297
00:46:18,697 --> 00:46:20,897
You were as good
as dead the moment you did.

298
00:46:33,097 --> 00:46:35,977
-Your Eminence, I have news.
-What is it?

299
00:46:36,297 --> 00:46:40,577
Kamyeri managed to escape before
he was taken to the castle to be hanged.

300
00:46:41,337 --> 00:46:42,897
What the hell are you saying?

301
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,057
How many lives did we sacrifice
to find Kamyeri?

302
00:46:46,217 --> 00:46:47,617
How could this happen?

303
00:46:47,697 --> 00:46:49,817
The men escorting him were killed.

304
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:54,737
You're doomed, Sadettin! You're doomed!

305
00:46:54,977 --> 00:46:56,657
You'll never succeed in this!

306
00:47:00,657 --> 00:47:01,777
Is that so?

307
00:47:05,377 --> 00:47:06,857
You'll be hanged for this treason!

308
00:47:10,057 --> 00:47:11,417
Is that so?

309
00:47:49,977 --> 00:47:51,217
Kayraldı.

310
00:47:52,817 --> 00:47:55,697
Send a messenger to
Gurcuoglu Zahireddin immediately.

311
00:47:56,297 --> 00:47:59,657
Tell him he is to find that traitor
Emir Kamyeri and kill him.

312
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:03,137
Confiscate his goods
and seize his property.

313
00:48:03,377 --> 00:48:06,337
If any of his family object,
put them to the sword,

314
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,817
and that includes his female slaves.

315
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:11,897
As you command, Eminence.

316
00:48:16,137 --> 00:48:19,177
The Sultan and his mother are behind this.

317
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:23,497
I'll hold them accountable.

318
00:48:33,297 --> 00:48:34,497
Your Eminence.

319
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:48,937
Well, a Seljuk soldier.

320
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,657
Take this to Aydoğmus immediately.

321
00:49:57,777 --> 00:49:59,657
I came without anyone seeing.

322
00:50:00,057 --> 00:50:02,337
<i>So, you work for Sadettin Köpek.</i>

323
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:06,217
That message is of vital importance.

324
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,857
Give Aydoğmus
and Emir Sadettin my regards.

325
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:13,097
They also send their regards.

326
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:16,337
<i>Marya.</i>

327
00:50:18,577 --> 00:50:22,697
<i>You vile woman. You think you have</i>
<i>the intelligence to play us as fools?</i>

328
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:24,697
<i>I'll reveal your little game.</i>

329
00:51:30,937 --> 00:51:32,697
My darling Hafsa.

330
00:51:33,617 --> 00:51:35,457
She just collapsed,
right in front of me.

331
00:51:37,937 --> 00:51:42,217
God, you're the only one who can
save her and the baby inside her.

332
00:51:43,577 --> 00:51:44,617
May I come in?

333
00:51:46,257 --> 00:51:47,537
Come in, Artuk Bey.

334
00:51:53,857 --> 00:51:56,457
-How is she, Artuk Bey?
-Did Hafsa wake up?

335
00:51:57,457 --> 00:52:00,577
Hafsa Hatun is sleeping.
Alçiçek Hatun is with her.

336
00:52:01,617 --> 00:52:06,417
She's clearly exhausted herself.
She needs complete rest.

337
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:09,977
I can't say much now, but...

338
00:52:10,817 --> 00:52:12,457
her condition is not good.

339
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:14,737
God help her.

340
00:52:16,977 --> 00:52:20,417
What would Bamsi do if anything
happened to her or the baby?

341
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:24,457
Mother, I'll stay with her,
if you'll allow it.

342
00:52:25,937 --> 00:52:27,417
May I come in?

343
00:52:31,897 --> 00:52:33,817
Is that Bamsi's voice?

344
00:52:36,617 --> 00:52:39,257
It is. Come in, Bamsi.

345
00:52:45,857 --> 00:52:49,097
-<i>Selamunaleykum</i>.
-<i>Aleykumselamun</i>, Bamsi.

346
00:52:49,497 --> 00:52:51,137
What are you doing here?

347
00:52:51,977 --> 00:52:53,617
Ertuğrul Bey sent me.

348
00:52:54,417 --> 00:52:56,577
I've brought important guests with me.

349
00:52:56,977 --> 00:52:59,297
-Guests?
-Who?

350
00:53:00,337 --> 00:53:01,297
Mother.

351
00:53:12,497 --> 00:53:13,497
My Sultan!

352
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:17,697
Mahperi Hatun!

353
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:36,457
We overcame many obstacles,
many challenges, much darkness,

354
00:54:37,217 --> 00:54:39,897
so that we might
reach this blessed night, Aslıhan.

355
00:54:41,857 --> 00:54:46,497
From now on,
we will illuminate the darkness together.

356
00:54:47,257 --> 00:54:49,897
We will overcome
any difficulties together, Turgut.

357
00:54:55,537 --> 00:54:57,137
I swear, Aslıhan.

358
00:54:58,457 --> 00:55:04,457
I swear, those who destroyed
our happiness and stole our peace...

359
00:55:06,777 --> 00:55:09,017
will never find peace
of their own in this world.

360
00:55:23,857 --> 00:55:24,977
This dagger...

361
00:55:27,617 --> 00:55:29,977
that you gave me before I went to war...

362
00:55:36,657 --> 00:55:38,657
I swear...

363
00:55:39,857 --> 00:55:42,217
I'll avenge you with this dagger.

364
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,217
That's the situation.

365
00:55:55,697 --> 00:55:58,417
We'll be guests in your tribe
until we have set our state free

366
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,577
from Sadettin Köpek.

367
00:56:07,217 --> 00:56:11,697
What do you mean by "guest"?
Our tent, our tribe, are yours, my Sultan.

368
00:56:12,897 --> 00:56:16,137
I hope you'll be as comfortable here
as you are in the palace, my Sultan.

369
00:56:16,857 --> 00:56:18,897
My father, Sultan Alaeddin,
used to take me

370
00:56:19,457 --> 00:56:23,537
and my late brother,
Kılıç Arslan, to the Oghuz tents.

371
00:56:25,017 --> 00:56:29,377
The days we spent hunting, joining
their councils, sleeping in Khagan tents,

372
00:56:29,897 --> 00:56:31,537
were the best days of my life.

373
00:56:34,737 --> 00:56:37,297
I don't know of a more comfortable place
than right here, Artuk Bey.

374
00:56:37,817 --> 00:56:39,017
Rest easy.

375
00:56:42,337 --> 00:56:43,577
My Sultan,

376
00:56:44,217 --> 00:56:48,457
we suffered the loss of many lives
as the princes fought over the throne.

377
00:56:49,737 --> 00:56:52,417
Their greed put us in this situation.

378
00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:58,977
But it is our duty to protect you,
even if it costs us our lives.

379
00:57:01,057 --> 00:57:03,417
Ertuğrul Bey has gone after Köpek.

380
00:57:03,777 --> 00:57:07,537
We all stand ready
to do whatever you ask of us.

381
00:57:11,337 --> 00:57:12,617
Thank you.

382
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:16,377
God willing, we'll overcome
these troubles together.

383
00:57:16,857 --> 00:57:17,817
God willing.

384
00:57:22,457 --> 00:57:26,017
We, our state, our homeland,
are grateful to you.

385
00:57:32,977 --> 00:57:34,057
My Sultan...

386
00:57:35,097 --> 00:57:39,857
if you'll excuse me, I would like
to go to my tent to see my wife.

387
00:57:41,617 --> 00:57:43,257
You can go, Chief Alp Bamsi.

388
00:57:45,937 --> 00:57:47,217
My Sultan.

389
00:57:48,857 --> 00:57:51,537
-Bamsi?
-What is it, Artuk Bey?

390
00:57:52,697 --> 00:57:55,017
Hafsa Hatun has worsened a bit today.

391
00:57:55,337 --> 00:57:58,577
Hafsa? Worsened?
What's wrong, Artuk Bey?

392
00:57:58,777 --> 00:57:59,977
She's pregnant, son.

393
00:58:01,817 --> 00:58:05,377
She's due soon. All this is normal.

394
00:58:06,177 --> 00:58:07,817
Try to stay calm.

395
00:58:09,497 --> 00:58:13,177
Artuk Bey, Mother Hayme.
Hafsa is all right, isn't she?

396
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:15,097
Tell me, my child will live.

397
00:58:17,377 --> 00:58:21,257
Bamsi, calm down. Alçiçek is with her.

398
00:58:22,817 --> 00:58:25,897
Now, go and see your wife. Go.

399
00:58:26,017 --> 00:58:27,857
I'll go and see her right now.

400
00:58:29,417 --> 00:58:30,617
My Sultan.

401
00:58:58,177 --> 00:58:59,897
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

402
00:59:06,657 --> 00:59:08,657
Hafsa? Can I come in, Hafsa?

403
00:59:13,457 --> 00:59:17,337
Bamsi? Bamsi! Bamsi, come in!

404
00:59:19,257 --> 00:59:21,897
My dear! My dear Hafsa!

405
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:27,017
Hafsa, light of my life, what happened?

406
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:32,817
God, help her. Help her.

407
00:59:33,457 --> 00:59:34,737
Alçiçek Hatun.

408
00:59:37,257 --> 00:59:39,617
Thank you. Thank you.

409
00:59:40,457 --> 00:59:44,097
Hafsa, that's better.
You're all right, aren't you?

410
00:59:44,817 --> 00:59:45,897
Bamsi!

411
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:52,457
I'm scared that I might not live
to hold our child,

412
00:59:52,777 --> 00:59:55,297
I'm scared I won't be a mother to it.

413
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:58,297
Don't speak like that,
don't speak like that.

414
00:59:59,217 --> 01:00:01,617
God has granted us this child.

415
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:05,817
Don't be downhearted.
The baby will arrive safe and sound.

416
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:11,057
I'm so glad you're here.
I'm so glad you're here, Bamsi. Thank God.

417
01:00:12,537 --> 01:00:14,737
What would I do without you?

418
01:00:14,977 --> 01:00:18,977
What are you saying?
Of course I'll always be with you!

419
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:22,897
Hafsa, I'm going to feed you myself.

420
01:00:23,097 --> 01:00:25,257
I'm going to get you some hot soup.

421
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:28,737
That'll help you get your strength back.

422
01:00:28,977 --> 01:00:31,737
Our child will be born healthy and happy.

423
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:37,457
Hafsa, we're going to fill our tent
and our tribe with lots of children!

424
01:00:37,577 --> 01:00:38,857
Don't you worry.

425
01:00:39,977 --> 01:00:43,137
God willing. God willing, Bamsi.

426
01:00:43,857 --> 01:00:47,897
May God intend us to see those days.

427
01:00:48,017 --> 01:00:51,937
He will, Hafsa. He will.
Hold on to that thought.

428
01:00:52,057 --> 01:00:53,537
Hold on to that thought.

429
01:00:55,057 --> 01:00:59,417
Now, you must get some rest.
Get some sleep. Come on.

430
01:01:02,417 --> 01:01:03,857
Come on, get some rest.

431
01:01:19,817 --> 01:01:20,937
Relax, comrade.

432
01:01:24,377 --> 01:01:25,417
Relax.

433
01:01:33,697 --> 01:01:34,857
Turgut.

434
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:39,097
You look so unhappy.

435
01:01:41,137 --> 01:01:44,977
I know... you are thinking
of Aslıhan Hatun.

436
01:01:48,177 --> 01:01:49,897
I think about her all the time, my Bey.

437
01:01:52,017 --> 01:01:54,617
The pain cuts my heart
like the blade of a dagger.

438
01:01:59,617 --> 01:02:02,137
Until I have avenged Aslıhan,

439
01:02:04,457 --> 01:02:06,377
even breathing is forbidden to me.

440
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:10,297
I know, my brave man. I know.

441
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:13,377
It is hard to bear.

442
01:02:17,497 --> 01:02:19,177
Be patient a little while longer.

443
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:25,177
We will avenge her, I swear that we will.

444
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:32,857
We must, my bey. We must.

445
01:02:34,657 --> 01:02:39,417
I'd gladly give my life
to see that bastard dead.

446
01:02:42,177 --> 01:02:43,297
My bey...

447
01:02:46,657 --> 01:02:48,057
I have a request of you.

448
01:02:49,697 --> 01:02:51,937
Anything, friend. Anything.

449
01:02:52,537 --> 01:02:53,457
If...

450
01:02:55,337 --> 01:02:56,937
I die for this cause...

451
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:02,497
bury me next to my Aslıhan.

452
01:03:06,177 --> 01:03:07,657
God willing...

453
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:13,497
none of us will fall as martyrs
before we can take that bastard's head.

454
01:03:17,737 --> 01:03:19,297
Rely upon it, Turgut.

455
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:24,137
God willing, bey.

456
01:03:26,977 --> 01:03:28,057
God willing.

457
01:03:42,377 --> 01:03:45,337
Sayyid of the frontier.

458
01:03:46,977 --> 01:03:49,617
Glorious Sultan.

459
01:03:53,097 --> 01:03:55,297
Sultan of the two seas...

460
01:03:56,897 --> 01:03:58,417
and of the two lands.

461
01:04:00,257 --> 01:04:02,337
Sultan of the Greeks...

462
01:04:03,577 --> 01:04:04,977
of Damascus...

463
01:04:06,177 --> 01:04:07,817
of Armenia...

464
01:04:10,617 --> 01:04:12,497
and of the Franks.

465
01:04:20,897 --> 01:04:27,417
<i>I am Sadettin Köpek. I walked</i>
<i>this path adorned with blood and fire.</i>

466
01:04:29,057 --> 01:04:33,777
<i>But every step I took,</i>
<i>took me a step closer to my reign.</i>

467
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:39,857
<i>I clawed my way to the top</i>
<i>of the mountain by the force of my will.</i>

468
01:04:44,257 --> 01:04:46,697
<i>My place is not a low one,</i>

469
01:04:47,577 --> 01:04:50,177
<i>it is high above, where the eagles nest.</i>

470
01:04:50,857 --> 01:04:56,057
<i>Now I have risen...</i>
<i>and reached my throne.</i>

471
01:04:57,297 --> 01:05:02,377
Sultan of the lands, the seas, the Greeks,
of Damascus, Armenia and the Franks,

472
01:05:02,737 --> 01:05:04,657
His Highness Sadettin Köpek.

473
01:06:22,337 --> 01:06:23,697
Ertuğrul.

474
01:06:29,377 --> 01:06:30,657
Ertuğrul!

475
01:07:13,537 --> 01:07:16,577
-May I come in, Your Eminence?
-Come.

476
01:07:21,217 --> 01:07:22,457
Your Eminence.

477
01:08:00,257 --> 01:08:01,697
Is there any news?

478
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:06,857
We discovered where the Sultan is,
Eminence.

479
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:09,057
Where?

480
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:12,377
He and Mahperi Hatun
are with the Kayi tribe.

481
01:08:13,577 --> 01:08:14,577
I knew it!

482
01:08:16,337 --> 01:08:18,257
And Ertuğrul? Where is he?

483
01:08:18,977 --> 01:08:21,937
He's not with his tribe.
No one knows where he is.

484
01:08:24,577 --> 01:08:25,977
My men are looking for him.

485
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:31,417
Also, this letter arrived from Aydoğmus.

486
01:08:45,537 --> 01:08:48,817
All this time, they couldn't find
a trace of Ertuğrul either.

487
01:08:52,177 --> 01:08:56,097
Günalp has been far too tolerant
of the Kayis' insolence!

488
01:08:58,737 --> 01:08:59,737
Günalp!

489
01:09:06,297 --> 01:09:08,097
What will you do, Your Eminence?

490
01:09:10,337 --> 01:09:12,897
Get a message to Aydoğmus immediately.

491
01:09:14,857 --> 01:09:17,177
Tell him to infiltrate the Kayi tribe...

492
01:09:18,217 --> 01:09:19,657
and kill the Sultan.

493
01:09:22,257 --> 01:09:25,537
Then the entire Kayi tribe
must be put to the sword.

494
01:09:27,017 --> 01:09:28,177
And Günalp Bey?

495
01:09:30,097 --> 01:09:32,257
Summon him here, to Sivas.

496
01:09:34,217 --> 01:09:37,657
That way we'll prevent him
hindering Aydoğmus.

497
01:09:40,817 --> 01:09:45,377
If you do this,
Ertuğrul will be sure to come after you.

498
01:09:48,697 --> 01:09:50,737
I'll be ready when he comes...

499
01:09:52,337 --> 01:09:54,097
{\an8}and I will finally take his life.

500
01:10:48,837 --> 01:10:49,757
Alps!

501
01:10:50,237 --> 01:10:52,477
Station yourselves all around the camp.

502
01:10:52,757 --> 01:10:55,677
Sadettin's dogs may attack
our village anytime.

503
01:10:56,317 --> 01:11:01,357
Gunkut, Melikshah,
you go out to the hills.

504
01:11:02,437 --> 01:11:06,957
Dumrul, Oguz, stay close to the well.

505
01:11:10,237 --> 01:11:11,237
Abdurrahman.

506
01:11:12,837 --> 01:11:15,197
You stay close to the marquee.

507
01:11:15,797 --> 01:11:17,677
Yes, Commander Bamsi.

508
01:11:19,837 --> 01:11:20,837
Alps!

509
01:11:21,837 --> 01:11:26,797
Know that all we want to do
is protect our sultan and our tribe.

510
01:11:27,597 --> 01:11:30,357
If those heinous hyenas
try to attack our tribe,

511
01:11:30,557 --> 01:11:33,717
we will kill them like the wolves we are!

512
01:11:33,917 --> 01:11:35,237
Hurrah!

513
01:11:36,677 --> 01:11:40,557
Now, take your positions and keep alert.

514
01:11:41,117 --> 01:11:43,597
-Yes, Commander Bamsi.
-Let's go!

515
01:12:05,997 --> 01:12:07,597
God help us.

516
01:12:07,997 --> 01:12:09,277
Amen.

517
01:12:09,997 --> 01:12:10,997
Someone is coming.

518
01:12:18,717 --> 01:12:20,197
With God's permission.

519
01:12:35,957 --> 01:12:37,037
Your Highness.

520
01:12:57,717 --> 01:12:59,517
What is it, Husamettin Karaca?

521
01:13:09,837 --> 01:13:11,037
May your victories...

522
01:13:12,077 --> 01:13:13,877
be everlasting, Your Highness.

523
01:13:15,037 --> 01:13:21,037
Have you so forgotten your hostility to me
that you would grovel before me?

524
01:13:23,677 --> 01:13:24,997
And how about you...

525
01:13:26,197 --> 01:13:28,197
emir of the whole world, Togan?

526
01:13:30,677 --> 01:13:35,317
You defied my orders two years ago

527
01:13:35,557 --> 01:13:38,157
and informed on me to the Sultan Alaeddin.

528
01:13:41,477 --> 01:13:42,477
Sir.

529
01:13:43,477 --> 01:13:45,797
We take refuge in the shade
of your greatness.

530
01:13:47,357 --> 01:13:49,797
You are not only a victorious commander,

531
01:13:51,117 --> 01:13:54,277
but also the emir of all emirs.

532
01:13:56,797 --> 01:13:58,077
We...

533
01:14:00,157 --> 01:14:02,357
are here to ask for your forgiveness.

534
01:14:02,797 --> 01:14:04,117
Is that so?

535
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:13,077
Before you begin the siege
on the great Samsat Castle,

536
01:14:13,997 --> 01:14:17,437
we'd be honored
if you would rest in Sivas.

537
01:14:21,077 --> 01:14:24,117
I have no time to rest, Husamettin Karaca.

538
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:27,237
The traitor Kamyeri got away.

539
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:34,317
I can't rest when my country
is under threat

540
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:37,237
from traitors and enemies.

541
01:14:37,757 --> 01:14:40,437
After Kamyeri got away,

542
01:14:40,797 --> 01:14:42,917
he asked me to give him refuge.

543
01:14:44,637 --> 01:14:47,877
Because he had gone against our country
and your orders,

544
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:49,597
we welcomed him warmly.

545
01:14:51,637 --> 01:14:52,677
Soldier!

546
01:14:57,957 --> 01:14:58,797
And then...

547
01:15:00,317 --> 01:15:02,877
along with the soldiers
that had saved him,

548
01:15:03,477 --> 01:15:05,277
we killed him.

549
01:15:19,157 --> 01:15:20,157
This is his ring.

550
01:15:21,557 --> 01:15:24,997
-Yes, Your Highness.
-This cap belonged to Kamyeri as well.

551
01:15:27,237 --> 01:15:30,397
He wore this cap on his head
when I beheaded him, Your Highness.

552
01:15:36,477 --> 01:15:37,477
Good.

553
01:15:38,477 --> 01:15:41,877
This is a great service to our country.
You will be repaid in kind.

554
01:15:42,157 --> 01:15:44,037
As a reward for this,

555
01:15:44,797 --> 01:15:49,237
we would like you to honor us
by setting up your camp at Sivas.

556
01:15:50,477 --> 01:15:51,477
Now, please.

557
01:15:51,837 --> 01:15:56,157
Rest a bit with your army
before you head for Samsat, sir.

558
01:16:06,397 --> 01:16:07,397
Fine.

559
01:16:07,837 --> 01:16:08,877
Kayraldi?

560
01:16:09,557 --> 01:16:10,557
Yes, sir?

561
01:16:11,557 --> 01:16:12,917
Let my army know...

562
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:16,317
that we will rest a while in Sivas.

563
01:16:18,717 --> 01:16:20,237
As you wish, Your Highness.

564
01:17:03,557 --> 01:17:05,517
<i>We were hunters,</i>
<i>but we have now become prey.</i>

565
01:17:06,237 --> 01:17:10,957
There are people inside
our borders, everywhere,

566
01:17:11,517 --> 01:17:13,637
who hate the success of our state.

567
01:17:14,277 --> 01:17:19,037
And now those damned Mongols
are preparing to attack.

568
01:17:19,757 --> 01:17:21,477
If something happens to me,

569
01:17:21,757 --> 01:17:25,037
I want to make sure my country
will be in safe hands, Gıyaseddin.

570
01:17:37,437 --> 01:17:40,837
Your legacy, this great country,
is being swarmed by hyenas, Father.

571
01:17:42,637 --> 01:17:44,717
They even deny us our own palace.

572
01:17:53,117 --> 01:17:55,437
God, give me the strength
to bear this pain.

573
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:02,597
<i>May I enter, Your Highness?</i>

574
01:18:06,117 --> 01:18:07,117
Come in.

575
01:18:16,117 --> 01:18:17,117
Selamunaleykum.

576
01:18:18,077 --> 01:18:19,197
Aleykumselamun.

577
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:23,357
I heard you were here, Your Highness.

578
01:18:23,877 --> 01:18:25,517
I wanted to pay you a visit.

579
01:18:25,637 --> 01:18:27,757
I'm happy to hear that. I'm honored.

580
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,277
The honor is mine, Your Highness.

581
01:18:30,997 --> 01:18:31,997
Come, sit.

582
01:18:43,357 --> 01:18:44,837
My dear İbn Arabi.

583
01:18:45,477 --> 01:18:48,517
First of all, I'd like you to know
how thankful I am to you.

584
01:18:50,157 --> 01:18:52,077
I almost killed Ertuğrul

585
01:18:52,277 --> 01:18:54,757
because of the traitors
swarming my country.

586
01:18:55,837 --> 01:18:59,797
Thank God that with your guidance,
I came to release him.

587
01:19:01,197 --> 01:19:03,997
Now, I come all the way here
to seek his protection.

588
01:19:04,957 --> 01:19:07,997
Whenever you receive a helping hand,

589
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:11,757
know that God is ultimately
behind it, Your Highness.

590
01:19:12,837 --> 01:19:16,397
No one makes decisions but him,
and no one is stronger than him.

591
01:19:18,037 --> 01:19:20,237
If I helped bring about something good,

592
01:19:21,037 --> 01:19:22,957
that was God's will.

593
01:19:23,597 --> 01:19:24,917
What a nice explanation.

594
01:19:27,077 --> 01:19:30,677
Ertuğrul Bey is on a harsh path
to rid our country of traitors

595
01:19:30,797 --> 01:19:32,997
and save it from great disaster.

596
01:19:35,117 --> 01:19:37,277
And here I am, doing nothing but waiting.

597
01:19:38,317 --> 01:19:42,237
Every moment I spend here
is like another stab in my heart.

598
01:19:44,077 --> 01:19:48,077
I feel like my country
is melting before my eyes,

599
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:50,957
and I'm just lounging about.

600
01:19:51,157 --> 01:19:56,117
The night is at its darkest
right before the dawn.

601
01:19:57,637 --> 01:20:02,997
Treasure the hardships you go through
to protect our country.

602
01:20:04,917 --> 01:20:09,877
For those bearing great hardship
in striving for God's cause...

603
01:20:11,357 --> 01:20:13,717
God's grace awaits them.

604
01:20:16,397 --> 01:20:18,637
However, you must be patient.

605
01:20:21,197 --> 01:20:28,197
Surely, God's wrath will fall upon
the cruel and traitorous like lightning.

606
01:20:30,277 --> 01:20:31,277
I hope so.

607
01:20:32,117 --> 01:20:34,357
I hope we get to see that day.

608
01:20:36,597 --> 01:20:40,517
Because being away from Konya,
from my palace,

609
01:20:40,757 --> 01:20:42,917
brings heaviness to my heart.

610
01:20:44,677 --> 01:20:46,797
There is a spring after every winter.

611
01:20:47,437 --> 01:20:50,717
Every separation ends with
a coming together, God willing.

612
01:20:51,077 --> 01:20:52,397
I hope so.

613
01:20:54,077 --> 01:20:56,077
When Muhammad...

614
01:20:58,357 --> 01:21:01,437
declared that he was the prophet,

615
01:21:02,317 --> 01:21:08,237
the polytheists did cruel things to him
and his followers.

616
01:21:09,277 --> 01:21:11,397
They laid down thorns in his path.

617
01:21:12,837 --> 01:21:14,557
They threw dirt on him.

618
01:21:16,157 --> 01:21:20,877
They called him a magician, a sophist,
and tried to deter him.

619
01:21:21,917 --> 01:21:23,717
They mocked him.

620
01:21:25,197 --> 01:21:29,517
The cruelty was so harsh that in the end,

621
01:21:29,837 --> 01:21:32,917
our prophet was compelled
to migrate to Medina

622
01:21:33,237 --> 01:21:35,317
from his hometown, Mecca.

623
01:21:37,477 --> 01:21:40,757
The situation caused him great grief.

624
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:46,797
However, the wisdom of God
was hidden beneath it.

625
01:21:48,477 --> 01:21:53,997
And he saw the fruit of his faith
and patience while he was alive.

626
01:21:55,157 --> 01:21:57,837
He was thrown out of Mecca...

627
01:21:59,237 --> 01:22:02,837
but returned as a great commander
and conquered his hometown.

628
01:22:04,397 --> 01:22:07,357
The number of followers
who attended his farewell sermon

629
01:22:08,077 --> 01:22:09,397
was as high as 124 thousand.

630
01:22:11,277 --> 01:22:15,877
And almost every surrounding country
converted to Islam.

631
01:22:18,157 --> 01:22:20,597
Those with patience always win.

632
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:25,397
Patience is hard,
but it is fruitful, Your Highness.

633
01:22:28,357 --> 01:22:31,797
You want to advance
the whole Muslim community

634
01:22:32,597 --> 01:22:34,957
and protect our country.

635
01:22:36,677 --> 01:22:40,757
You are a soldier to a holy cause.

636
01:22:42,037 --> 01:22:44,357
Now, rest at ease.

637
01:22:46,117 --> 01:22:49,597
Before long, the efforts of Ertuğrul Bey

638
01:22:50,277 --> 01:22:52,957
and yourself will prove fruitful.

639
01:22:54,237 --> 01:22:56,157
And with God's help,

640
01:22:56,997 --> 01:22:59,517
our country will be rid of traitors.

641
01:23:01,357 --> 01:23:05,077
You will be welcomed back to Konya

642
01:23:06,077 --> 01:23:08,797
with a great parade, with God's help.

643
01:23:10,077 --> 01:23:11,317
I hope so.

644
01:23:11,757 --> 01:23:13,717
Your words enlighten me.

645
01:23:14,597 --> 01:23:16,357
They give me peace.

646
01:23:16,877 --> 01:23:18,437
God bless you.

647
01:23:19,677 --> 01:23:22,357
May God help our land.

648
01:23:22,757 --> 01:23:24,917
May He keep us on this holy path.

649
01:23:25,437 --> 01:23:26,437
Amen.

650
01:23:28,157 --> 01:23:29,157
Amen.

651
01:23:39,517 --> 01:23:40,517
Come, dear.

652
01:23:41,997 --> 01:23:43,837
Sniff this, Hafsa Hatun.

653
01:23:44,597 --> 01:23:45,557
Sniff.

654
01:23:47,597 --> 01:23:49,557
It will refresh you.

655
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:03,597
Artuk Bey.

656
01:24:07,477 --> 01:24:09,517
Will I be able to hold my baby?

657
01:24:16,077 --> 01:24:19,717
I'll do my best to ensure that,
Hafsa Hatun. Don't you worry.

658
01:24:21,517 --> 01:24:22,717
Hafsa.

659
01:24:23,237 --> 01:24:25,157
Don't exhaust yourself.

660
01:24:30,717 --> 01:24:32,277
My dear.

661
01:24:33,517 --> 01:24:34,517
Please, God...

662
01:24:35,717 --> 01:24:37,797
help my daughter.

663
01:24:38,237 --> 01:24:39,517
Amen.

664
01:24:56,757 --> 01:24:59,317
I heard Hafsa Hatun was feeling bad.

665
01:24:59,557 --> 01:25:01,637
I came to see how she is doing.

666
01:25:01,837 --> 01:25:02,957
Thank you.

667
01:25:04,277 --> 01:25:07,477
Hafsa is okay. She will be better soon.

668
01:25:14,197 --> 01:25:15,477
Mahperi Hatun.

669
01:25:18,997 --> 01:25:19,997
Bamsi...

670
01:25:24,477 --> 01:25:25,477
Commander Bamsi.

671
01:25:27,717 --> 01:25:30,557
Our Hafsa isn't feeling well.

672
01:25:31,957 --> 01:25:34,157
You are right, Mahperi Hatun.

673
01:25:34,397 --> 01:25:37,917
We need to take Hafsa Hatun somewhere
where we can treat her better.

674
01:25:38,197 --> 01:25:40,877
But I don't know where that could be.

675
01:25:46,597 --> 01:25:47,597
What about Konya?

676
01:25:49,437 --> 01:25:53,117
The late Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad
had a hospital built there

677
01:25:53,437 --> 01:25:55,317
called Hospital Alaeddin.

678
01:25:56,957 --> 01:25:59,037
Its facilities are quite good.

679
01:25:59,597 --> 01:26:02,917
Hafsa can be treated there.

680
01:26:05,477 --> 01:26:07,917
What can I say? I just don't know.

681
01:26:09,317 --> 01:26:12,877
Would that be good for Hafsa and our baby?

682
01:26:13,677 --> 01:26:18,157
Many seemingly hopeless cases
became healthy again there.

683
01:26:19,677 --> 01:26:23,637
With God's help,
Hafsa will get better as well.

684
01:26:24,117 --> 01:26:25,517
Mahperi Hatun is right.

685
01:26:25,877 --> 01:26:27,517
I agree with her.

686
01:26:27,757 --> 01:26:31,917
It's likely that Hafsa Hatun will receive
proper treatment at the hospital.

687
01:26:37,797 --> 01:26:40,317
Artuk Bey, how can we possibly do this?

688
01:26:40,557 --> 01:26:42,517
How can we take her? I...

689
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:45,397
My duty is to protect our sultan.

690
01:26:45,677 --> 01:26:47,157
I can't leave the camp.

691
01:26:48,677 --> 01:26:51,357
Plus, I'm a fugitive.

692
01:26:51,637 --> 01:26:53,477
They will arrest me
the moment they see me.

693
01:26:53,637 --> 01:26:55,117
What would my Hafsa do then?

694
01:26:55,277 --> 01:26:57,197
Don't worry, Bamsi.

695
01:26:57,517 --> 01:27:00,917
I will send her with the bravest
alps and women we have.

696
01:27:03,717 --> 01:27:05,717
I'll write a letter personally.

697
01:27:08,397 --> 01:27:12,677
We have loyal, trusted doctors there.

698
01:27:12,917 --> 01:27:17,437
Once they get my letter,
they will treat her properly.

699
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,597
<i>The Sultan is at the Kayi Tribe.</i>

700
01:27:54,717 --> 01:27:56,277
<i>I called on Günalp to come to Sivas.</i>

701
01:27:56,397 --> 01:27:59,517
<i>Once he leaves the castle,</i>
<i>you have absolute authority.</i>

702
01:27:59,597 --> 01:28:03,397
<i>First of all, take our best soldiers</i>
<i>and sneak into the Kayi Tribe.</i>

703
01:28:03,757 --> 01:28:07,397
<i>Kill the Sultan and his mother</i>
<i>for the well-being of our country.</i>

704
01:28:07,517 --> 01:28:10,637
<i>Then, find out where Ertuğrul is</i>
<i>and finish him off.</i>

705
01:28:11,277 --> 01:28:15,797
<i>If nobody will tell you where he is,</i>
<i>kill everyone at the Kayi Tribe.</i>

706
01:28:16,277 --> 01:28:17,997
<i>Yours, Emir Sadettin Köpek.</i>

707
01:28:32,837 --> 01:28:35,037
The moment I've waited for is here.

708
01:28:37,077 --> 01:28:39,077
So, the Sultan is at the Kayi Tribe.

709
01:28:51,237 --> 01:28:54,157
There is news for you
from Emir Sadettin, sir.

710
01:28:56,397 --> 01:28:57,597
From Emir Sadettin?

711
01:29:10,877 --> 01:29:11,877
What is it, sir?

712
01:29:15,237 --> 01:29:17,277
Emir expects me at Sivas.

713
01:29:17,877 --> 01:29:18,877
Sivas?

714
01:29:19,677 --> 01:29:20,677
But why, sir?

715
01:29:21,917 --> 01:29:23,117
We'll see once we get there.

716
01:29:24,997 --> 01:29:28,597
He ordered me to leave you here
as my representative.

717
01:29:34,197 --> 01:29:35,957
When do you depart, sir?

718
01:29:37,277 --> 01:29:38,277
Right away.

719
01:29:39,237 --> 01:29:40,957
I will take the guards closest to me.

720
01:29:41,557 --> 01:29:42,717
Yes, sir.

721
01:29:46,477 --> 01:29:47,477
Aydoğmus.

722
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:51,917
I want to find everything
just as I left it.

723
01:29:52,717 --> 01:29:53,597
Understand?

724
01:29:55,877 --> 01:29:59,517
You will not touch the Kayi Tribe,
nor the market.

725
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:04,397
Our traditions demand that,

726
01:30:05,517 --> 01:30:07,957
and you know what happens to those
who dare break tradition.

727
01:30:10,917 --> 01:30:12,077
As you wish, sir.

728
01:30:52,037 --> 01:30:54,317
-Selamunaleykum.
-Aleykumselamun, Ertuğrul Bey.

729
01:31:16,677 --> 01:31:18,917
What's the situation, Husamettin Bey?

730
01:31:19,117 --> 01:31:21,397
Your plan was a success, Ertuğrul Bey.

731
01:31:21,877 --> 01:31:24,957
Once he saw Emir Kamyeri's
cap and sealed ring,

732
01:31:25,077 --> 01:31:26,797
Köpek trusted us.

733
01:31:31,357 --> 01:31:32,477
Well done.

734
01:31:33,197 --> 01:31:35,157
What about their camp?

735
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:40,517
I told them about
where to set up their camp...

736
01:31:41,837 --> 01:31:43,237
in great detail.

737
01:32:04,917 --> 01:32:07,037
They will set up their camp
in a safe place.

738
01:32:11,757 --> 01:32:14,477
I will take over the army
once Sadettin dies.

739
01:32:15,957 --> 01:32:20,277
Then, I will protect you.

740
01:32:22,157 --> 01:32:24,797
You will be guided by Togan Bey
once you get inside the camp.

741
01:32:25,437 --> 01:32:29,117
They will increase security measures
around the camp and marquee at night.

742
01:32:30,437 --> 01:32:35,077
We will sneak in the camp where
and when they least expect it.

743
01:32:38,717 --> 01:32:43,677
We will finish off Köpek
on the day he least expects it.

744
01:32:45,277 --> 01:32:46,757
Once Köpek dies,

745
01:32:47,597 --> 01:32:49,597
you'll be responsible for the camp.

746
01:32:52,357 --> 01:32:54,957
That way, we leave the camp safely.

747
01:32:55,557 --> 01:32:56,997
I'll be ready.

748
01:32:58,197 --> 01:33:00,117
I'll move if anything goes wrong.

749
01:33:01,157 --> 01:33:04,717
And I'll fight to the death
for the final time, Ertuğrul Bey.

750
01:33:05,957 --> 01:33:07,557
Don't do that, Husamettin Bey.

751
01:33:10,397 --> 01:33:12,477
Köpek will slaughter you
and Togan Bey alike.

752
01:33:13,797 --> 01:33:17,317
The Sultan needs the two of you alive.

753
01:33:20,077 --> 01:33:23,437
Even if we die,
act as though you are allies of Köpek

754
01:33:23,917 --> 01:33:25,557
so that the Sultan is not left alone.

755
01:33:29,157 --> 01:33:34,037
Our nation will be eternal thanks to
self-sacrificing, brave men like you.

756
01:33:34,437 --> 01:33:37,877
-You have my absolute faith.
-We'll do this together, Husamettin Bey.

757
01:33:39,277 --> 01:33:41,197
The time we've been waiting for has come.

758
01:33:42,477 --> 01:33:45,437
Now, our swords shall do the talking.

759
01:33:48,157 --> 01:33:50,957
We'll make Köpek regret
celebrating his victory.

760
01:33:53,397 --> 01:33:55,317
May God help us.

761
01:33:56,397 --> 01:33:57,357
Amen.

762
01:34:58,317 --> 01:34:59,317
Hafsa.

763
01:35:00,717 --> 01:35:02,117
Know that...

764
01:35:03,237 --> 01:35:04,437
it's best for you...

765
01:35:05,477 --> 01:35:08,517
and our baby to be treated
at the hospital.

766
01:35:10,837 --> 01:35:12,917
They have everything there.

767
01:35:13,157 --> 01:35:16,357
The best physicians
in our country reside there.

768
01:35:18,517 --> 01:35:21,237
Plus, Mahperi Hatun will write a letter.

769
01:35:22,397 --> 01:35:25,597
The doctors will treat you well.

770
01:35:28,197 --> 01:35:29,877
How can I stop worrying?

771
01:35:31,757 --> 01:35:35,077
What will I do in that strange place?

772
01:35:37,117 --> 01:35:38,117
Please.

773
01:35:38,837 --> 01:35:42,237
Do you think I'll leave you alone
when you go?

774
01:35:42,757 --> 01:35:44,757
Do you think I'd do that?

775
01:35:45,997 --> 01:35:46,997
Hafsa.

776
01:35:47,757 --> 01:35:50,437
I'll come to you as soon as I can.

777
01:35:54,717 --> 01:35:58,597
What if I lose our baby
while you are gone?

778
01:35:59,797 --> 01:36:00,797
Hafsa.

779
01:36:02,877 --> 01:36:04,877
Don't talk like that.

780
01:36:05,997 --> 01:36:09,797
You will both return to our tribe
safe and sound.

781
01:36:11,397 --> 01:36:12,397
I hope so.

782
01:36:13,557 --> 01:36:14,797
I hope so, Bamsi.

783
01:36:19,557 --> 01:36:20,517
Hafsa.

784
01:36:20,837 --> 01:36:23,797
You will see. It will be all right.

785
01:36:24,397 --> 01:36:27,957
We will live to see
happy, bright days with our baby.

786
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:31,237
God will help us.

787
01:36:31,517 --> 01:36:32,917
He'll help us, Hafsa.

788
01:36:43,077 --> 01:36:44,077
Okay.

789
01:36:45,197 --> 01:36:47,437
Fine, Bamsi. I'll go.

790
01:36:48,317 --> 01:36:49,317
That's my Hafsa

791
01:36:51,077 --> 01:36:52,077
Hafsa.

792
01:36:53,437 --> 01:36:54,437
The apple of my eye.

793
01:38:45,397 --> 01:38:47,357
<i>Just as I was preparing</i>
<i>for the Samsat conquest,</i>

794
01:38:48,197 --> 01:38:49,597
look what happened.

795
01:38:50,757 --> 01:38:52,757
I was almost assassinated.

796
01:38:52,957 --> 01:38:54,197
The bastard.

797
01:38:54,317 --> 01:38:58,397
He's so treacherous, he would kill
an emir who would die for his country.

798
01:38:58,717 --> 01:39:01,597
This is nothing, Günalp. This is nothing.

799
01:39:01,877 --> 01:39:06,157
Who knows what else he will do,
unless we kill him?

800
01:39:07,117 --> 01:39:09,677
<i>I know him the best, Günalp Bey.</i>

801
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:13,957
Sadettin doesn't work for our nation,
but for his own power.

802
01:39:14,357 --> 01:39:16,117
You must choose your side now.

803
01:39:16,677 --> 01:39:20,797
I secured both the margraveship
and this castle by myself.

804
01:39:21,117 --> 01:39:24,837
And now, I'm handing them over to you
to prevent bloodshed.

805
01:39:25,477 --> 01:39:26,477
I have no reservations,

806
01:39:26,717 --> 01:39:31,317
as I'm leaving Karacahisar
to a brave man who I know will protect it

807
01:39:31,437 --> 01:39:32,637
until he dies.

808
01:39:32,957 --> 01:39:33,917
<i>Is it Ertuğrul Bey,</i>

809
01:39:34,997 --> 01:39:37,477
<i>or is it the man who taught me</i>
<i>to rule a castle,</i>

810
01:39:37,837 --> 01:39:41,277
<i>the man I love and respect like a father,</i>
<i>Emir Sadettin, who is lying?</i>

811
01:39:43,317 --> 01:39:44,997
<i>What if Ertuğrul Bey is right?</i>

812
01:39:46,237 --> 01:39:47,397
<i>I will find out.</i>

813
01:39:48,317 --> 01:39:50,117
<i>I must find out.</i>

814
01:40:07,477 --> 01:40:08,637
Come on, everyone.

815
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:10,837
Let us go.

816
01:41:02,877 --> 01:41:03,877
Today,

817
01:41:04,357 --> 01:41:07,077
your country needs your service.

818
01:41:07,917 --> 01:41:10,117
This is the greatest service of all time.

819
01:41:12,277 --> 01:41:15,037
The son of a traitor, Gıyaseddin,

820
01:41:15,397 --> 01:41:19,117
who killed Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad
and his mother,

821
01:41:19,357 --> 01:41:21,277
will be executed.

822
01:41:22,757 --> 01:41:26,997
They are at the marquee of Ertuğrul,
who aided and abetted them.

823
01:41:27,317 --> 01:41:29,277
Death to the traitors!

824
01:41:29,917 --> 01:41:31,997
Emir Sadettin will bring

825
01:41:32,277 --> 01:41:35,077
stability and peace to our country.

826
01:41:37,877 --> 01:41:38,877
And you all

827
01:41:39,477 --> 01:41:43,837
are honorable soldiers
who lay down your lives for this cause.

828
01:41:46,117 --> 01:41:49,437
If we went in with our army,
the Sultan would escape.

829
01:41:50,237 --> 01:41:51,237
However...

830
01:41:52,757 --> 01:41:55,877
we will present ourselves to the Sultan
as soldiers of his...

831
01:41:57,117 --> 01:41:58,917
and then leave death in our wake.

832
01:42:08,517 --> 01:42:09,517
It is your duty...

833
01:42:11,077 --> 01:42:12,077
to slaughter...

834
01:42:13,037 --> 01:42:17,557
the Sultan, his mother,
and whoever else is at the marquee,

835
01:42:17,917 --> 01:42:22,117
along with Ertuğrul and the Sultan's
entire lineage, men and children alike!

836
01:42:22,957 --> 01:42:26,637
Long live Emir Sadettin!
Long live Emir Sadettin!

837
01:42:30,477 --> 01:42:31,477
Let us go.

838
01:42:34,677 --> 01:42:35,677
Open!

839
01:42:46,917 --> 01:42:47,917
We are ready, sir.

840
01:42:49,557 --> 01:42:52,597
We're ready to fight for our cause
as always, Turgut.

841
01:42:55,677 --> 01:42:56,877
May God help us.

842
01:42:57,277 --> 01:42:58,277
Amen, brother.

843
01:43:01,837 --> 01:43:03,237
Give me your blessings, sir.

844
01:43:03,317 --> 01:43:06,277
God bless you, Turgut.
And now it's your turn.

845
01:43:06,397 --> 01:43:07,677
God bless you, sir.

846
01:43:09,637 --> 01:43:10,957
Give me your blessings, brother.

847
01:43:11,917 --> 01:43:13,397
God bless you, brother.

848
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:20,237
We have already laid down
our lives for our nation, Ertuğrul.

849
01:43:22,397 --> 01:43:23,917
May God help us.

850
01:43:24,477 --> 01:43:25,397
Amen.

851
01:43:25,477 --> 01:43:26,477
Amen.

852
01:43:28,557 --> 01:43:32,197
For those who we see first thing
in the morning. For our loved ones.

853
01:43:34,237 --> 01:43:40,077
For our tribes, who had to sacrifice
many brave men and women.

854
01:43:40,877 --> 01:43:42,117
For our nation.

855
01:43:43,877 --> 01:43:45,157
This is the day, everyone.

856
01:43:47,597 --> 01:43:48,797
May God help us.

857
01:43:50,637 --> 01:43:51,637
-Amen.
-Amen.

858
01:43:53,077 --> 01:43:54,077
Let us go.

859
01:44:43,037 --> 01:44:43,997
Come on!

860
01:45:16,637 --> 01:45:18,157
Welcome, Your Highness.

861
01:45:18,357 --> 01:45:19,677
Welcome, Your Highness.

862
01:45:19,957 --> 01:45:25,037
-Welcome, Your Highness.
-Welcome, Your Highness.

863
01:45:25,477 --> 01:45:26,477
Your Highness.

864
01:46:05,037 --> 01:46:06,557
Please, sit.

865
01:46:13,757 --> 01:46:14,757
Husamettin.

866
01:46:15,757 --> 01:46:16,997
Where is Togan Bey?

867
01:46:17,957 --> 01:46:23,117
He excused himself so he could see
if your army needed anything.

868
01:46:24,717 --> 01:46:26,677
He should be here soon, Your Highness.

869
01:46:27,837 --> 01:46:29,077
Good.

870
01:46:31,237 --> 01:46:38,237
I'm happy to be here with
Husamettin Karaca and my valuable emirs.

871
01:46:41,117 --> 01:46:42,477
As you already know,

872
01:46:42,957 --> 01:46:46,637
I am about to head into a war
which is important to our nation.

873
01:46:46,837 --> 01:46:48,477
May God grant you victory.

874
01:46:49,037 --> 01:46:50,677
May God never take you from us.

875
01:46:50,917 --> 01:46:52,637
-Amen.
-Amen.

876
01:46:52,917 --> 01:46:54,717
Amen.

877
01:46:55,797 --> 01:47:00,317
We will bury our enemies' thirst for power
alongside their bodies

878
01:47:00,637 --> 01:47:02,877
and alongside Samsat Castle.

879
01:47:02,997 --> 01:47:05,637
Of course. May God grant you victory.

880
01:47:05,757 --> 01:47:07,957
Amen.

881
01:47:11,637 --> 01:47:16,477
However, I must tell you that there is
something even more important

882
01:47:16,877 --> 01:47:18,437
than this victory.

883
01:47:39,917 --> 01:47:42,477
-Who deserves to die?
-That bastard Sadettin.

884
01:47:44,877 --> 01:47:46,477
Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.

885
01:47:47,397 --> 01:47:48,557
Thank you.

886
01:47:57,077 --> 01:47:58,357
How is the situation, Togan Bey?

887
01:47:58,957 --> 01:48:01,957
Sadettin Köpek is at the marquee
with his most trusted men.

888
01:48:02,717 --> 01:48:04,997
Since Husamettin Karaca trusts nobody,

889
01:48:05,197 --> 01:48:07,437
only the two of us know
of the plan to kill Sadettin.

890
01:48:09,677 --> 01:48:11,437
These two brave commanders, too.

891
01:48:16,557 --> 01:48:20,677
All right. When I catch
that bastard alone in his tent,

892
01:48:21,437 --> 01:48:23,477
his army won't be there to save him.

893
01:48:23,557 --> 01:48:25,637
I hope we can get rid of
that nuisance, Ertuğrul Bey.

894
01:48:28,917 --> 01:48:32,077
If this doesn't clean up nicely,
a civil war will await us.

895
01:48:32,277 --> 01:48:34,997
We'll deal with that dog.

896
01:48:35,477 --> 01:48:38,077
-May God give you all strength.
-Amen.

897
01:48:38,677 --> 01:48:40,157
Now, I must go back to the marquee.

898
01:48:40,277 --> 01:48:42,117
Sadettin Köpek will want to see me.

899
01:48:43,717 --> 01:48:45,237
Wear these uniforms.

900
01:48:45,317 --> 01:48:49,317
Our commanders will get you in the camp
and Sadettin's marquee.

901
01:48:49,397 --> 01:48:50,517
Thank you.

902
01:48:50,597 --> 01:48:52,877
-May God help you.
-Amen.

903
01:49:56,597 --> 01:49:57,757
As you already know,

904
01:49:58,757 --> 01:50:02,157
I prevented the death of our Sultan
and the destruction of our army

905
01:50:02,757 --> 01:50:05,237
by not sending them to Amid.

906
01:50:09,397 --> 01:50:11,957
Once we achieve victory over Samsat,

907
01:50:12,477 --> 01:50:15,037
Amid will hopefully be next.

908
01:50:15,997 --> 01:50:19,157
But I don't think our Sultan
is fit to lead this attack, either.

909
01:50:19,237 --> 01:50:20,237
This is the truth.

910
01:50:20,957 --> 01:50:22,877
We can't allow our Sultan

911
01:50:23,157 --> 01:50:25,837
to command our army into destruction.

912
01:50:26,157 --> 01:50:30,837
When the whole world is our enemy,
the weakest army could end us.

913
01:50:37,277 --> 01:50:38,277
Husamettin.

914
01:50:39,357 --> 01:50:40,797
What do you think?

915
01:50:47,637 --> 01:50:50,437
If you lead the Amid campaign,

916
01:50:51,477 --> 01:50:55,677
I'm sure you will secure yet another
victory for our army, Your Highness.

917
01:50:58,197 --> 01:51:04,917
And so, the Mongols will keep
their distance from our mighty nation.

918
01:51:08,597 --> 01:51:10,917
I will personally stay by your side.

919
01:51:13,557 --> 01:51:14,757
I have already...

920
01:51:16,477 --> 01:51:17,797
laid down my life for you.

921
01:51:27,437 --> 01:51:30,037
-May I enter, Your Highness?
-Come in, Togan.

922
01:51:41,757 --> 01:51:44,117
I was just announcing
some important decisions

923
01:51:44,357 --> 01:51:46,397
to those gathered here.

924
01:51:48,037 --> 01:51:51,917
Let our Sultan entertain himself
at his palace.

925
01:51:52,277 --> 01:51:56,757
We, the soldiers, will be the ones
to keep our nation strong.

926
01:52:15,797 --> 01:52:16,637
Hush.

927
01:52:16,797 --> 01:52:18,717
<i>Ladies, may I come in?</i>

928
01:52:19,846 --> 01:52:22,206
Yes, Lady Mahperi.

929
01:52:31,526 --> 01:52:33,606
Hello, ladies. Please don't be disturbed.

930
01:52:34,446 --> 01:52:36,966
We haven't had the chance
to talk to each other since we arrived.

931
01:52:37,766 --> 01:52:40,286
I wanted to say a couple of words to you
in private.

932
01:52:48,046 --> 01:52:49,046
Good boy.

933
01:52:49,966 --> 01:52:51,446
What a sweet baby that is.

934
01:52:52,166 --> 01:52:53,166
What is his name?

935
01:52:53,286 --> 01:52:54,286
His name is Savci.

936
01:52:56,486 --> 01:52:58,606
Lady Halime, do you mind if I hold him?

937
01:53:07,366 --> 01:53:08,366
Aw...

938
01:53:09,486 --> 01:53:10,486
Good boy.

939
01:53:16,806 --> 01:53:17,806
Savci...

940
01:53:20,966 --> 01:53:24,006
Here, Lady Mahperi. Have a seat.

941
01:53:41,446 --> 01:53:43,766
This reminds me of Giyaseddin's infancy.

942
01:53:44,646 --> 01:53:47,206
I used to forget everything else
when I held him, just like this.

943
01:53:50,286 --> 01:53:52,486
I would forget about the palace,

944
01:53:53,006 --> 01:53:54,286
the internal issues, everything.

945
01:53:55,366 --> 01:53:57,326
Giyaseddin was the only thing
I could think about.

946
01:54:00,646 --> 01:54:02,366
I've done everything for him.

947
01:54:02,806 --> 01:54:04,126
So that he can be the sultan.

948
01:54:04,966 --> 01:54:07,046
I know I'm the one responsible

949
01:54:07,686 --> 01:54:09,686
for the current situation,

950
01:54:10,166 --> 01:54:12,486
of me, of him and of the state.

951
01:54:16,686 --> 01:54:18,246
I don't care about my own life.

952
01:54:18,966 --> 01:54:21,486
I just pray for God to save our state
and my son.

953
01:54:22,086 --> 01:54:25,486
We all think about our state
before all else, Lady Mahperi.

954
01:54:26,046 --> 01:54:28,526
Our sons, warriors, have gone

955
01:54:29,126 --> 01:54:31,486
to chase down the traitors.

956
01:54:32,766 --> 01:54:37,126
You left your palace and came here
for the sake of our state.

957
01:54:39,006 --> 01:54:42,806
Once our state is liberated
from all the dangers,

958
01:54:44,326 --> 01:54:46,326
the rest is up to God.

959
01:54:49,446 --> 01:54:51,486
And I upset you so many times,
Lady Halime.

960
01:54:53,326 --> 01:54:54,926
What's done is done, Lady Mahperi.

961
01:54:56,286 --> 01:54:59,246
It's not the time
to hold each other accountable.

962
01:55:02,406 --> 01:55:05,086
We can't argue about our egos

963
01:55:05,326 --> 01:55:07,926
while our state and home are in danger.

964
01:55:09,206 --> 01:55:12,686
From now on, we should do all we can

965
01:55:12,846 --> 01:55:15,166
for the good of our state.

966
01:55:15,926 --> 01:55:18,446
There's nothing more important to us.

967
01:55:21,766 --> 01:55:24,046
God, who makes the sun shine
after every night,

968
01:55:24,246 --> 01:55:27,366
will surely let the sun shine
after this dark period.

969
01:55:28,926 --> 01:55:30,406
That's all we can say.

970
01:55:37,486 --> 01:55:38,486
My Savci, Come on.

971
01:55:44,806 --> 01:55:46,086
Hush.

972
01:55:47,406 --> 01:55:48,406
It's all right.

973
01:56:00,286 --> 01:56:01,406
Hush.

974
01:56:05,046 --> 01:56:07,406
May God help Ertuğrul Bey and the others.

975
01:56:07,486 --> 01:56:08,766
Amen, my Sultan.

976
01:56:09,566 --> 01:56:11,326
May God deliver our state

977
01:56:11,686 --> 01:56:14,966
from evil people like Sadettin Köpek.

978
01:56:17,806 --> 01:56:18,806
But...

979
01:56:19,646 --> 01:56:23,046
going into a military quarter
with so many soldiers in it...

980
01:56:28,766 --> 01:56:30,126
Don't worry, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

981
01:56:31,286 --> 01:56:32,766
If Sadettin dies,

982
01:56:32,846 --> 01:56:35,246
Husamettin Karaca will have
the authority over the army.

983
01:56:36,006 --> 01:56:38,486
Then, it'll be up to him

984
01:56:38,846 --> 01:56:40,726
to protect Ertuğrul Bey and his warriors.

985
01:56:41,566 --> 01:56:44,006
And I'm sure he will protect them.

986
01:56:45,406 --> 01:56:48,966
All they need to do is to get that dog
Sadettin's head.

987
01:57:03,606 --> 01:57:07,206
<i>Oh, my Hafsa. Where could you be now?</i>

988
01:57:07,646 --> 01:57:10,446
<i>What are you doing on your own</i>
<i>with the baby, my Hafsa?</i>

989
01:57:18,326 --> 01:57:19,766
It's the Head Alp, Bamsi.

990
01:57:20,686 --> 01:57:23,406
-Hello, men.
-Hello, Head Alp Bamsi.

991
01:57:24,126 --> 01:57:26,246
Good men.

992
01:57:34,366 --> 01:57:35,966
Someone is coming.

993
01:57:46,006 --> 01:57:48,286
Why are these bastards here?

994
01:57:50,406 --> 01:57:52,086
Let's find out.

995
01:57:52,246 --> 01:57:53,246
Come on.

996
01:58:01,606 --> 01:58:02,806
I hope it's something good.

997
01:58:03,246 --> 01:58:04,646
Who are they, Artuk Bey<i>?</i>

998
01:58:22,246 --> 01:58:23,246
Step aside.

999
01:58:26,366 --> 01:58:28,366
We need to talk to the Sultan.

1000
01:58:28,606 --> 01:58:31,686
What do you mean? What would the Sultan
be doing among our tribe?

1001
01:59:51,926 --> 01:59:55,846
Everything is for the crucial interests
of our state.

1002
01:59:56,246 --> 01:59:59,046
I know no one has any doubts about that.

1003
02:00:02,566 --> 02:00:05,526
Husamettin Karaca, governor of Sivas,

1004
02:00:05,926 --> 02:00:08,046
and his banner man Togan,

1005
02:00:09,286 --> 02:00:10,646
they did something great

1006
02:00:11,486 --> 02:00:13,206
and got rid of the biggest enemy

1007
02:00:13,766 --> 02:00:17,686
of our state, Kamyeri,
thus giving us the chance

1008
02:00:18,086 --> 02:00:21,326
to have a moment of peace.

1009
02:00:22,086 --> 02:00:23,766
I'm grateful to them.

1010
02:00:29,406 --> 02:00:31,526
May God protect our state
from the extremists.

1011
02:00:32,686 --> 02:00:37,126
We will not be beaten as long as we have
talented viziers like you, for sure.

1012
02:01:01,486 --> 02:01:02,646
It is our primary duty...

1013
02:01:04,606 --> 02:01:06,366
to make this state,

1014
02:01:06,806 --> 02:01:11,206
which was entrusted to us
by my late father, Sultan Keyhusrev,

1015
02:01:12,766 --> 02:01:14,486
live forever.

1016
02:01:37,766 --> 02:01:42,086
Long Live Prince Sadettin!

1017
02:01:42,206 --> 02:01:46,046
-Long Live Prince Sadettin!
-Oh God, please protect our state.

1018
02:01:46,206 --> 02:01:49,326
Long Live Prince Sadettin!

1019
02:01:49,406 --> 02:01:51,206
Long Live Prince Sadettin!

1020
02:01:51,566 --> 02:01:53,966
Long Live Prince Sadettin!

1021
02:01:54,926 --> 02:01:57,326
Long Live Prince Sadettin!

1022
02:01:57,566 --> 02:01:59,966
Long Live Prince Sadettin!

1023
02:02:00,166 --> 02:02:04,726
Long Live Prince Sadettin!

1024
02:02:07,486 --> 02:02:09,286
Long Live Prince Sadettin!

1025
02:02:15,766 --> 02:02:17,486
Now go and rest.

1026
02:02:19,726 --> 02:02:25,046
Tomorrow we will leave for a long,
hard journey.

1027
02:02:26,846 --> 02:02:28,286
We'll have a glorious victory

1028
02:02:28,806 --> 02:02:31,606
and make our state proud,
God willing.

1029
02:02:41,126 --> 02:02:44,006
May God bless our endeavor.

1030
02:02:44,686 --> 02:02:46,006
Amen.

1031
02:04:12,166 --> 02:04:14,086
Köpek must be alone in his tent.

1032
02:04:17,646 --> 02:04:18,886
We'll find out now.

1033
02:04:35,006 --> 02:04:36,446
Köpek is in his tent, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

1034
02:04:38,006 --> 02:04:41,046
Kayraldi is with him.
Wait for him to come out.

1035
02:04:56,286 --> 02:04:57,486
He is out.

1036
02:05:04,006 --> 02:05:05,446
May God help you.

1037
02:05:06,246 --> 02:05:07,246
Amen.

1038
02:05:12,526 --> 02:05:13,526
Come on, men.

1039
02:05:57,326 --> 02:05:58,286
Brother Sungur.

1040
02:06:00,526 --> 02:06:01,566
Turgut...

1041
02:06:02,926 --> 02:06:04,126
Stay sharp.

1042
02:06:06,126 --> 02:06:08,926
I'll go in alone with two commanders.

1043
02:06:12,126 --> 02:06:13,886
My Bey<i>. </i>Let me go in with you.

1044
02:06:16,006 --> 02:06:17,806
I don't want you to go in alone.

1045
02:06:18,886 --> 02:06:20,846
I'll go in as a messenger, Turgut.

1046
02:06:21,726 --> 02:06:23,406
They only accept one person.

1047
02:06:26,086 --> 02:06:28,966
You'll make a move if things go awry.

1048
02:06:34,246 --> 02:06:35,686
As you order, my Bey<i>.</i>

1049
02:06:37,486 --> 02:06:38,966
Don't worry about us.

1050
02:06:40,246 --> 02:06:41,966
We'll do whatever is necessary.

1051
02:06:42,966 --> 02:06:45,926
My brother. May God help you.

1052
02:06:46,766 --> 02:06:47,766
Amen, brother.

1053
02:06:49,006 --> 02:06:50,726
May God help you, my Bey<i>.</i>

1054
02:06:51,046 --> 02:06:55,366
Hopefully, this will be the last day
for that bastard.

1055
02:06:56,806 --> 02:06:57,806
Hopefully, my Turgut.

1056
02:07:00,726 --> 02:07:01,926
Very well, men.

1057
02:07:03,366 --> 02:07:05,046
-Very well.
-Let's move.

1058
02:07:23,406 --> 02:07:24,926
What's going on, Artuk Bey<i>?</i>

1059
02:07:29,206 --> 02:07:31,526
I have a bad feeling
about this, my sultan.

1060
02:08:23,726 --> 02:08:26,046
A messenger from Samsat is here
to see the blessed Vizier.

1061
02:08:26,126 --> 02:08:28,726
-It's important.
-The blessed Vizier is resting.

1062
02:08:29,406 --> 02:08:31,726
It's important, soldier. Let him know.

1063
02:08:54,526 --> 02:08:56,526
The blessed Vizier is waiting
for the messenger.

1064
02:09:02,206 --> 02:09:03,206
Give me your weapon.

1065
02:09:31,446 --> 02:09:33,646
May God help our Bey<i>.</i>

1066
02:09:34,766 --> 02:09:35,766
Amen.

1067
02:10:00,406 --> 02:10:02,646
So, you are finally here, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

1068
02:10:04,326 --> 02:10:06,206
You've taken your first step into hell.

1069
02:10:22,202 --> 02:10:53,002
