1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Episode 105 start after 12:39 min.

2
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,099
<i>May I enter, Your Highness?</i>

3
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:17,339
Come in.

4
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:30,099
You sent for me, Your Highness?

5
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:32,899
How fares our army?

6
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,699
The <i>soubashi </i>commanders are
at their posts, Your Highness.

7
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:38,619
The catapults and crossbows
should be ready soon.

8
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:41,939
We've also got enough horses
and mules for deployment.

9
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:46,899
Great.

10
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,419
Now, take this letter.

11
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:55,259
Give it to Mahperi Hatun in Alaiye.

12
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:56,899
Before I launch this campaign,

13
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:59,659
have her come to Konya with
my son Ghiyath al-Din.

14
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:01,379
I'd like to see them.

15
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,099
Ertuğrul Bey will be here soon.

16
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:08,459
I have important matters
to discuss with them.

17
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,139
As you wish, Your Highness.

18
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:14,179
The poets and scholars would like
to see you and show their work

19
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,259
before you leave for the campaign.

20
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:19,779
The famous poet Qol Ghali of the Oghuz
has come to Konya on your orders.

21
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,339
He's waiting to see you.

22
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:22,979
Good.

23
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:24,699
Let him come, too.

24
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,979
As we sharpen our swords for battle,
we must keep our spirits up.

25
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,459
We haven't met with the poets in a while.

26
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,099
The poet's meeting is tomorrow.

27
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:39,979
Have my emirs and commanders be ready.

28
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,659
As you wish, Your Highness.

29
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:58,219
Mother. Endure it, Mother.
Don't give up.

30
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:01,179
Please, God.

31
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:03,139
Give strength to my mother.

32
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:07,979
Hayme Hatun is in bad shape,
she's having difficulty breathing.

33
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,259
Leave us, please.

34
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,299
Artuk Bey, I brought your sack.

35
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:15,739
Here, your sack.

36
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:19,019
God.

37
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:21,219
You are the one who cures.

38
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,459
You are all knowing.

39
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:40,619
Mother Hayme's condition is
pretty bad, sir.

40
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:46,419
Artuk Bey.

41
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:49,019
We need to find a cure at all costs.

42
00:15:49,219 --> 00:15:53,459
-Get her whatever she needs.
-Bamsı, it's not like that.

43
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,099
You leave now. I'll figure it out.

44
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:58,819
Don't lose hope, Sister.

45
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:00,739
Mother Hayme will be all right.

46
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:07,419
Mother.

47
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:09,939
Please, God.

48
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:12,819
There's no doubt that you are all wise.

49
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:14,979
You are the curer.

50
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:17,099
Don't take our Mother,

51
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:20,099
our beloved, from us.

52
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:26,979
Mother.

53
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:29,059
Mother!

54
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:30,899
Artuk Bey.

55
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:33,059
Bring water, Halime, quick.

56
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,139
Here.

57
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,059
<i>May I enter, Your Highness?</i>

58
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:46,019
Come in.

59
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,899
Your Highness.

60
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:54,659
What is it, Göktuğ?

61
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,939
Is what I heard true?

62
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:00,299
Indeed.

63
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:05,179
Ertuğrul conquered
the Karacahisar Fortress all by himself.

64
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:11,539
And now the Sultan has granted him
the lands around Söğüt.

65
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,459
And to top it off...

66
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:22,419
Ertuğrul is bringing one-fifth
of the spoils to share with us.

67
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:29,779
If Ertuğrul voices his suspicions
about you to our Sultan...

68
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:41,859
What suspicions?

69
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:49,019
Ertuğrul has no doubts, Göktuğ.

70
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:56,059
I'm damn sure that he knows all about me.

71
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:03,459
And now, he's coming
to tell our Sultan everything he knows.

72
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:08,819
Then... what will you do, sir?

73
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:21,699
It's far too soon for the Sultan
to die, Göktuğ.

74
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,499
I don't have control over
his heir and mother yet.

75
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:30,619
If the Sultan dies suddenly,

76
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:34,739
my enemies at the palace
will skin me alive,

77
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:36,819
and hang me on the gates of the palace.

78
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:38,779
What about Ertuğrul?

79
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:48,019
We tried to kill him many times.

80
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:52,979
If we can't succeed this time,
we'll attract everyone's attention.

81
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:56,379
And then, the Sultan won't let us live.

82
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:01,299
In that case, you have no other way

83
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:04,099
than to clear your name
in the eyes of the Sultan.

84
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:11,779
The Sultan must have no doubt that
whoever tried to poison him at the inn

85
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:14,459
got what he deserved.

86
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:19,499
This will also clear Ertuğrul's suspicions
about me.

87
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,059
So that...

88
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:26,659
we may keep getting
ever closer to our goal.

89
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,059
We need a scapegoat for this, Göktuğ.

90
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:32,299
Who is it going to be, sir?

91
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:37,179
Nizamettin.

92
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:40,899
Emir Nizamettin.

93
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,259
Emir Nizamettin.

94
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:51,459
He sent a gift box to our Sultan,
saying that he won't be able to attend

95
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:54,219
tomorrow's meeting with the poets.

96
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,459
I heard about it.

97
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:11,939
You'll change Emir Nizamettin's box
with the box I'll prepare.

98
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:16,659
The Sultan will take his gift there.

99
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,979
What are you going to gift him, sir?

100
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:26,339
I'll give him a present he can't forget.

101
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,499
It'll be legendary.

102
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:31,979
Is the Sultan going to die?

103
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,259
We shall do our part.

104
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,179
The rest depends on the angel of death.

105
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,499
When the Mongols...

106
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:11,619
murdered...

107
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:14,379
our mothers and fathers...

108
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:20,859
we were left all alone in the mountains.

109
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,219
Ertuğrul Bey found us and took us in.

110
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:27,579
Mother Hayme became...

111
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:32,219
our mother,
and Suleyman Shah became our father.

112
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,059
Ertuğrul Bey...

113
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:37,779
was more than a brother.

114
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:39,219
Turgut, brother.

115
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:42,339
Brother.

116
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:45,659
What would we have done without them?

117
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:49,779
We might have become bandits by now.

118
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:51,499
We'd be goners for sure.

119
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:56,259
Brother, they didn't leave us alone.

120
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:58,779
How can we repay this debt?

121
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:04,739
Brother.

122
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,499
We must find a way to remedy Mother Hayme.

123
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:24,899
I can't bear waiting like this...

124
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,419
with nothing I can do.

125
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:29,179
I can't!

126
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:31,499
Turgut.

127
00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:34,019
It's tearing me apart.

128
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,579
Turgut.

129
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:42,179
Turgut.

130
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,579
Mother Hayme will be all right.

131
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:30,979
She will be okay.

132
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:33,539
I hope so.

133
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:07,259
Son.

134
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:10,059
Who is this boy?

135
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:14,619
It's my son, Osman.

136
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:35,339
Osman...

137
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:38,979
My wonderful boy.

138
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:44,539
With a searing gaze...

139
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:47,979
his face shines bright.

140
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:51,299
He's such a wonderful boy, right?

141
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:56,899
I hope he becomes a man...

142
00:25:57,699 --> 00:25:59,579
that will carry on our name.

143
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,459
I hope so.

144
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:08,859
This is a mortal world.

145
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:12,739
I may be here today...

146
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:15,019
and gone tomorrow.

147
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:21,379
Bring him up the way...

148
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:24,939
we brought you up.

149
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,259
We'll raise him together, Mother.

150
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:37,579
It was you who raised me,
my brothers, and my sons.

151
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:39,979
You sang them to sleep with lullabies.

152
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:45,179
It will be you who'll raise Osman, Mother.

153
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:49,179
The arms of Mother Hayme are
a lion's cradle.

154
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,059
He'll grow up in your arms.

155
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:05,819
Osman...

156
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:23,779
Mother.

157
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:26,219
Osman.

158
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:30,779
Osman.

159
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:37,299
Thank God, she came to her senses.

160
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:38,779
Mother.

161
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:16,019
This is an amazing invention,
Your Highness.

162
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:18,739
I just hope it doesn't jam
when the Sultan opens it.

163
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,819
Try it then and see if it jams.

164
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:24,179
As you wish.

165
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,019
And, what is that, Your Highness?

166
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:26,659
Poison.

167
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,419
The one that was given
to the Sultan before.

168
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:38,099
The head physician knows about it.

169
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:43,059
Then, when he examines him,
he'll recognize the poison.

170
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:48,139
And the poisoning before will be
blamed on Emir Nizamettin.

171
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:57,619
Take this chest.

172
00:29:58,579 --> 00:30:00,579
Change it with Emir Nizamettin's.

173
00:30:01,859 --> 00:30:03,299
Tomorrow, the meeting of the poets...

174
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:06,059
will be a feast for the eyes.

175
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:09,259
As you wish, sir.

176
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:15,779
Open!

177
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:34,299
Son.

178
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,299
Ertuğrul.

179
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:38,579
Mother.

180
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,299
My enduring mother.

181
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:46,979
Don't wear yourself out, Mother.

182
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:54,579
Hayme Hatun is all right, sir.

183
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:56,179
Don't worry.

184
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:59,299
But she survived a huge crisis.

185
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:01,619
It'd be best for her to rest.

186
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:05,619
Thank God.

187
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:08,659
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

188
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:09,979
Thank God.

189
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:11,779
Ertuğrul Bey.

190
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,299
Have some rest.

191
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:17,619
You must be tired.
I'll wait by my mother's side tonight.

192
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:19,539
Don't worry about me, Halime.

193
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:21,819
You can leave.

194
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:23,699
I'll be by her side.

195
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:26,539
-If that's what you want.
-All right, sir.

196
00:31:26,939 --> 00:31:27,939
Of course.

197
00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:46,819
I'm worried that something's going
to happen Mother Hayme, Artuk Bey.

198
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:50,459
I love her like my own mother.

199
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:54,379
You all treated me so kindly...

200
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:56,419
After so little time,

201
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:59,299
I loved her and the others so much.

202
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,899
Such sweet words, Marya.

203
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:08,099
I'm happy to hear that you think this way
and that you're happy here.

204
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:11,139
You treated me kindly as well, Artuk Bey.

205
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:15,019
I was so happy to become your wife.

206
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,819
What did I do
to deserve all this goodness?

207
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,779
Your heart is pure, Marya.

208
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:23,979
You have no ill-will in you.

209
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:29,459
You took care of Gündüz
and protected him.

210
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:32,059
This meant a lot to us.

211
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,139
I have never been so happy in my life.

212
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:48,379
I'm sure with you,
we'll live happily ever after.

213
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,139
I hope so, Marya.

214
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:57,579
We'll live to see many happy days.

215
00:32:58,139 --> 00:32:59,139
I hope so.

216
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:23,619
Mother.

217
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,019
Mother.

218
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:38,939
Tell me, son.

219
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:47,139
Why are you so tearful?

220
00:33:47,979 --> 00:33:48,979
Mother...

221
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:53,139
You suffered a great deal for your sons.

222
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:59,779
You cried for them so much that crying
my eyes out is nothing compared to that.

223
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:06,579
You left your sons behind
and joined my cause for me.

224
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:09,819
How can I ever repay you?

225
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:13,219
I'm all right, son.

226
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,739
I dreamed about Osman...

227
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,099
last night.

228
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:29,299
<i>My son, Osman.</i>
<i>He'll change our unfortunate fate.</i>

229
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,059
<i>He'll make sure</i>
<i>the Oghuz take root here.</i>

230
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:44,059
Suleyman Shah named him.

231
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,859
May he live a long life.

232
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:52,219
Now, I can die in peace.

233
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:56,019
I felt him in my arms.

234
00:34:57,899 --> 00:34:58,939
I kissed him.

235
00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:02,939
I breathed in his smell.

236
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:07,859
See?

237
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:09,579
I'm okay.

238
00:35:10,979 --> 00:35:11,979
Now,

239
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:15,859
get back to your duty.

240
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:23,299
That's what befits the margrave
of our country.

241
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:28,379
I sent the news to Dündar
and my older brothers, Mother.

242
00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:31,499
I asked them to come at once.

243
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:37,179
I asked them to join me
and let us live here together.

244
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:46,699
Your words...

245
00:35:50,539 --> 00:35:55,539
reminded me of the smell of my sons, dear.

246
00:35:58,099 --> 00:35:59,939
God bless you.

247
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:03,019
May you never fall on your knees.

248
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:07,059
God bless you.

249
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:09,539
Come on.

250
00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:13,099
Go back to your duty.

251
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,539
All right, mother.

252
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,659
May God protect you.

253
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:24,379
May God protect you as well, son.

254
00:36:25,379 --> 00:36:26,379
My brave son.

255
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:47,059
Before Ertuğrul enters the Hanlı Bazaar,

256
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:49,539
you will disguise yourselves
as merchants and blend in.

257
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:52,139
Nobody will recognize you in the crowd.

258
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:54,219
-What about you, sir?
-Me?

259
00:36:56,059 --> 00:36:59,259
I'll be inside this basket
that we'll gift Ertuğrul.

260
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,979
Once we are in, the rest is easy.

261
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:07,059
Our men hid swords under the tables
where they'll sit

262
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:09,659
by disguising themselves the night before.

263
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:12,179
Once we get inside,

264
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:15,659
we must kill the guards posted
at the inner door and close it.

265
00:37:16,219 --> 00:37:18,659
We must prevent the alps from entering.

266
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:22,099
There'll be few men with Ertuğrul.

267
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:24,619
-He'll be defenseless.
-And then what, sir?

268
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:26,219
How do we get out?

269
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:29,899
We will set fire to the Hanlı Bazaar
after we kill Ertuğrul.

270
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:34,619
Once Titan sees the rising smoke,
he'll know that Ertuğrul is dead.

271
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:37,299
He'll come to our rescue with his men.

272
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:40,579
That's enough.

273
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:42,419
Let's get going.

274
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:36,339
Keep your eyes open.

275
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:39,059
This is going to be a cruel battle
for our holy cause,

276
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:40,099
with no second chances.

277
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:44,659
Ares will set fire to the inn
once he's dealt with Ertuğrul.

278
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:49,019
When the smoke rises from the inn,
we'll attack.

279
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:51,219
Get ready.

280
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,979
Do you have faith that
Ares will succeed this time?

281
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:58,499
God is with Ares.

282
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:01,219
His only chance is to succeed this time.

283
00:39:02,179 --> 00:39:04,739
I'm sure that barbaric Turk will get
what he deserves this time.

284
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:06,339
Don't be so sure.

285
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,259
It's not so easy to defeat Ertuğrul.

286
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:15,459
Ares is a great warrior, Angelos.
Remember that.

287
00:39:16,419 --> 00:39:18,539
He won't stop unless he kills Ertuğrul.

288
00:40:09,779 --> 00:40:12,499
-What did you bring?
-It's made exclusively for Ertuğrul Bey.

289
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,419
This isn't much, but...

290
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:10,339
Mother, smell this.

291
00:41:15,379 --> 00:41:16,379
Here, Mother Hayme.

292
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:19,499
Let me.

293
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:25,859
May it help you recover.

294
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:29,539
Thank you, dear.

295
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:34,739
At last, I'll get to see
all my children before I die.

296
00:41:36,459 --> 00:41:38,299
What more could I ask for?

297
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:42,819
When Sungur Tekin Bey,
Gündoğdu Bey,

298
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:47,259
and Dündar's return,
our unity will get even stronger, Mother.

299
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:48,699
I hope so, dear.

300
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:50,939
I do hope so.

301
00:41:51,899 --> 00:41:56,139
Now, I must get up
and start the preparations.

302
00:41:56,739 --> 00:41:57,739
-Mother.
-Mother Hayme.

303
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,019
What are you doing?

304
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:02,779
You need to rest.
We can do it.

305
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:06,619
We can't let you work
while we are here, Mother Hayme.

306
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:08,699
That's right.

307
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:12,379
I can't contain myself.

308
00:42:13,379 --> 00:42:17,019
I can't express how much I miss them.

309
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:24,019
My heart is burning to see...

310
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:26,579
my sons.

311
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:30,779
If they could come in one piece...

312
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:34,779
I'll cook for them myself.

313
00:42:36,739 --> 00:42:39,379
I'll make them a bowl of soup.

314
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:41,859
That's all I want.

315
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,899
Mother Hayme.
You need to rest.

316
00:42:45,459 --> 00:42:50,939
We'll handle the preparations ourselves
until they come.

317
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:57,859
Fine, my girls.

318
00:42:59,459 --> 00:43:02,539
Now then, let me rest a bit.

319
00:43:03,259 --> 00:43:04,259
Mother.

320
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:07,739
Why didn't my uncles come here
with my father?

321
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:10,979
What can I say, son?

322
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:15,899
Your uncles have their own tribes there.

323
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:18,939
There are enemies there too.

324
00:43:20,259 --> 00:43:22,259
If they left their tribe...

325
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:24,539
the enemy would attack.

326
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:28,819
Let's all get together, Grandmother.
I want my uncles.

327
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:33,059
I'll tell them the story about
how I plucked Ares' eye out.

328
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:35,779
My boy.

329
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:38,099
Fine, tell them.

330
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,339
My dear boy.

331
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:42,939
Your Grandmother loves you.

332
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:14,899
Aziz Yusuf was 11 years old.

333
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:18,259
Prophet Jacob was asleep.

334
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:22,459
He saw Joseph in a strange dream.

335
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,299
And he asked his forefathers
its interpretation.

336
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:32,899
As the full moon rose,
11 stars bowed down before me in my dream.

337
00:44:33,499 --> 00:44:36,299
I saw this dream for sure.

338
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:39,379
Pray, tell me what it means now.

339
00:44:40,899 --> 00:44:42,579
What's the meaning of this dream of mine?

340
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:45,859
How will it end up? Tell me.

341
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:48,419
Show me the meaning clearly.

342
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:52,259
Does my dream contain a hidden bliss?

343
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:56,299
O Muhammad, Joseph saw your dream.

344
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:00,299
The moon, the sun,
and 11 stars bowed down.

345
00:45:01,219 --> 00:45:03,259
Why did the stars pull the grass?

346
00:45:04,779 --> 00:45:07,059
Now, tell me in detail.

347
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:13,219
God bless you, Qol Ghali.

348
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:38,059
May God bless your victory
and give you a long life, Your Highness.

349
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:39,779
Amen.

350
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:44,379
Ensure the safety of the inn, Bamsı.

351
00:45:44,979 --> 00:45:47,419
-Tell everyone to be alert.
-Yes, sir.

352
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,499
Men!

353
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:55,139
Keep your hands at your swords.

354
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:58,779
Look out for any enemy's attack.

355
00:45:59,379 --> 00:46:02,819
All right. Take your position now.

356
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:05,499
Go on.

357
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,899
Margrave Ertuğrul Bey.

358
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:40,459
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you.

359
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:43,699
Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.

360
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:48,859
-I'd like to welcome you all, as well.
-Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.

361
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,619
We are happy to see you.

362
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,619
-Aziz.
-Yes, Your Highness.

363
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,179
Why didn't Emir Nizamettin attend?

364
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:04,419
It was because he was sick, Your Highness.

365
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:07,659
However, he sent you a gift box.

366
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,579
Nizamettin.

367
00:47:14,419 --> 00:47:15,819
My loyal emir.

368
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:19,379
He knows best what to gift me.

369
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,659
Bring it over here,
let's see what's inside.

370
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:27,219
Yes, Your Highness.

371
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:46,419
With this conquest,
there's a new order in trade.

372
00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:51,539
First of all,
with the peace we will provide,

373
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:56,219
trades at the inn will be safer
and more fruitful.

374
00:47:57,379 --> 00:47:59,499
We will keep the taxes low.

375
00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:02,339
The Bazaar will grow two-fold.

376
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:07,299
Every merchant that comes here
must leave with satisfaction,

377
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:10,139
so that wherever he goes he will preach

378
00:48:10,419 --> 00:48:15,099
just how abundant and peaceful a place
the Hanlı Bazaar is.

379
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:21,019
That way, people from all over the world
will come here to trade.

380
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,379
If you expand the trade,

381
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:27,579
our people will prosper and be rich.

382
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,899
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
We are happy that you are here.

383
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:32,779
-Thank you.
-Ertuğrul Bey.

384
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:34,899
Yes, my tradesman.

385
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:37,699
We'd like you to accept
this Persian carpet

386
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:41,539
as thanks for your kindness.

387
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,419
Thank you.

388
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:19,219
Open it up, Aziz.

389
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:43,939
Atsız.

390
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:49,499
Bastards.

391
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:58,099
This will be your grave, Ertuğrul.

392
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,819
You won't even have a grave, Ares.

393
00:50:01,939 --> 00:50:03,739
O God!

394
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:55,619
What's this?

395
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:57,699
What's the meaning of this?

396
00:50:58,059 --> 00:50:59,219
Make way!

397
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:03,939
It's a poisoned arrow.

398
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:05,659
It's poisoned.

399
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:08,299
It's a trap, Your Highness.

400
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:21,859
Aziz!

401
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:26,539
Is this chest not the chest
Nizamettin sent me?

402
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:29,939
That's true, sir.
I brought it myself.

403
00:51:31,939 --> 00:51:33,619
How could emir Nizamettin do this?

404
00:51:38,419 --> 00:51:42,219
Nizamettin is a loyal emir of mine.

405
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:46,619
I'd expect anyone but him to do this.

406
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:53,019
-What's all that noise?
-It's coming from inside.

407
00:51:53,499 --> 00:51:55,019
-Let's go in.
-Ertuğrul Bey.

408
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:57,979
I'm here, sir.

409
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:00,099
Make way, brothers.

410
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,659
Brothers, push!

411
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:17,619
They closed this door too.

412
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:22,059
Come on!

413
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:07,579
Sir!

414
00:53:12,579 --> 00:53:13,579
My brother!

415
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:24,630
What if there's something
behind this, Aziz?

416
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:28,030
I'll start an investigation in the palace
right away.

417
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:31,270
Find Nizamettin, wherever he is,

418
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,990
and bring him here!

419
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,230
Until we find the ones who did this,

420
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,590
everyone is a suspect.

421
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:40,950
Everyone should know.

422
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,470
Yes, my sultan.

423
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:08,750
I'll find whoever stabbed the Great Sultan
of the Seljuks in the back...

424
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,590
in his own palace...

425
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:15,430
and bring him here for his punishment.

426
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,030
I'll hang him by Konya's door...

427
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:23,030
so anyone with betrayal on their minds
will see him and give up.

428
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:59,030
Brother, come on!
With the strength of your faith.

429
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,950
God is one!

430
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,510
Alps, check if he's dead.

431
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,310
He's alive, Bey.

432
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:46,950
My brave man.

433
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,670
May you rest in peace.

434
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:15,190
Atsız...

435
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:19,910
He was such a brave man who sacrificed
so much for our state.

436
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:23,790
And he carried out so many duties for us.

437
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:30,150
As long as we have such brave men,
our state will go on forever.

438
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,550
May God send more of them.

439
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,470
Amen.

440
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:53,550
Atsız's funeral will be held
with our other martyrs in our village.

441
00:57:55,230 --> 00:58:00,270
I'll visit his grave when I'm done
with the scumbag Ares.

442
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,670
The smoke still hasn't risen from
Hanlı Bazaar.

443
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:36,110
There must be something wrong.

444
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:40,030
I'll go check what's going on.

445
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,910
Obviously, Ares couldn't manage
to kill Ertuğrul.

446
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,430
If this is the case, we can't help him.

447
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:48,390
We don't have many men.

448
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,630
To attack while Ertuğrul is still alive

449
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,430
-would be suicide.
-I can't let Ares die there.

450
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,510
And I can't let someone like you die.

451
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,230
We all need a warrior like you.

452
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:06,790
If he can't make it, they'll either
kill him or take him hostage.

453
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,630
And they know you.

454
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,270
If they see you,
they'd never let you live.

455
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:17,270
Titan, it's all over.
Just understand that.

456
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,790
Ares couldn't make it.

457
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:22,790
You'll replace him.

458
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:29,350
Don't worry, we'll soon find out
about what happened to Ares.

459
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:32,350
How?

460
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:36,430
There's someone in the castle
that's very close to Ertuğrul.

461
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:39,150
He's our eyes and ears in the castle.

462
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:41,670
He'll let me know what's going on soon.

463
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,950
Who is this person so close to Ertuğrul?

464
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,190
I'll tell you when the time comes.

465
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,310
Now, let's go to the cellar
and wait for the news.

466
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:55,630
If Ertuğrul takes Ares to the castle,
he'll let us know.

467
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,910
You can grin to the demon you'll befriend
in the place you're going.

468
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:37,470
You cruel scumbag!

469
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,790
It's time for you to pay for everything,
Tekfur Ares.

470
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:45,910
Now either tell me everything you know
one by one,

471
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:48,670
or I'll separate your head from your body.

472
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:52,110
I won't surrender to you, Ertuğrul.

473
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:58,630
I'd rather die.

474
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,830
But I won't surrender.

475
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:08,230
Why are you still talking when
you're in this pathetic position?

476
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:15,390
My bey, if you'll excuse us,
we'll decapitate this degenerate.

477
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:18,110
Not now, my Turgut.

478
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,430
Not now.

479
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,990
Keep your swords away for a while.

480
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:33,310
I know you've been playing games

481
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:38,110
with that traitor Emir Sadettin
to take over Hanlı Bazaar.

482
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,750
You'll tell me all about it.

483
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:46,990
So, Bey, we're getting rid of these
two degenerates.

484
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,390
You won't die peacefully, Ares.

485
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,070
You won't die peacefully.

486
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,310
Take this degenerate away.

487
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,510
Once again, poison.

488
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:11,430
Once again, an ambush.

489
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:18,230
If it was the enemy, we'd be finished
with them nobly on the battlefield.

490
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:25,670
When will we see the end of the traitors
who are worse than my enemies?

491
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:37,310
Can I come in, my sultan?

492
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:38,630
Come in, Aziz.

493
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,990
We brought Emir Nizamettin, my sultan.

494
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:49,030
Bring him in right away!

495
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,430
My sultan, we looked everywhere in
his mansion.

496
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:54,830
We questioned his wives, slaves
and servants.

497
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,150
We found these in his mansion.

498
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,150
These are the letters written

499
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:32,910
for the emperor and the tekfur
of Bilecik.

500
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:38,430
They are new. The ink has just dried.

501
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:42,230
He gave them information...

502
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:46,030
about my army and my battle route.

503
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:50,430
Seems like he didn't have a chance to send
them yet, my sultan.

504
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:54,950
What does it say, my sultan?

505
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,110
The tekfur of Bilecik wrote...

506
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,670
to Emir Nizamettin about where to
find the poison...

507
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,550
that he'd give me.

508
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:10,390
From the former priest that
Ertuğrul killed.

509
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:12,950
He made him do everything.

510
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:17,670
Let Emir Sadettin know right away.
I want him in my presence.

511
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,550
Bring that traitor in as well! Quick!

512
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,390
-Quick!
-Your wish is my command, my sultan.

513
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:33,630
Little time left.

514
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:41,310
Soon Sadettin's palace will be built.

515
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:02,390
-<i>Can I come in, Majesty Emir?</i>
-Come in.

516
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,590
They brought Emir Nizamettin,
Majesty Emir.

517
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:13,750
Did they find the letters that I placed
in his palace?

518
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:17,630
We placed it with the help of the slave
you gifted him.

519
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:20,190
-They must have.
-Good.

520
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:24,510
When the sultan reads those letters,
he'll go mad.

521
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:27,990
He won't believe
that Nizamettin is innocent

522
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:32,070
even if everyone he knows says he is.

523
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,990
<i>Can I come in, Majesty Emir?</i>

524
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:37,630
Come in.

525
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:43,830
Our sultan is waiting for you,
Majesty Emir.

526
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:47,870
The sultan's wish is my command.

527
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:59,990
Let's go and watch with joy
how Nizamettin gets punished.

528
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:05,030
From now on, you'll be the emir that
our sultan trusts the most, Majesty Emir.

529
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:26,310
In the name of God.

530
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:33,150
Grandmother!

531
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,790
Grandmother!

532
01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:38,390
Grandmother would die for you.

533
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:40,030
-What's this?
-Tell me, Gündüz,

534
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:41,230
why are you so excited?

535
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,990
I brought molasses, Mother!

536
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:47,390
-So Grandmother can recover quickly.
-So nice of you, son.

537
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,750
Oh, my brave boy.

538
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:54,190
You've got such a good heart.

539
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:58,110
As long as you are such a brave Alp,
nothing will happen to me.

540
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:00,590
Nothing will happen, Grandmother.

541
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,870
I am Gündüz Alp,
the son of Great Ertuğrul Bey,

542
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:08,430
-Of course.
-<i>Can I come in, Mother Hayme?</i>

543
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:10,750
Come on, Mother.

544
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,190
Go ahead.

545
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:22,910
Ertuğrul Bey caught Ares
and he's bringing him to the castle.

546
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,750
See, I told you

547
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:30,150
my father would get him
and make him pay for it.

548
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:33,230
And now my father will
cut his other eye out!

549
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:36,310
Of course he will, son!

550
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:39,950
Your brave father would never let
the enemy get away.

551
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:43,270
Thank God, Mother.

552
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:47,470
Finally, Ares's head is in the hands
of my bey.

553
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:49,950
Let's go.

554
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:51,470
Mother Hayme.

555
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,110
Thank God you're okay.

556
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:56,230
But you should rest more.

557
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:00,070
Mother.

558
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:03,630
You should stay. Don't exhaust yourself.

559
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:06,310
I can't sit still, daughter.

560
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:09,590
I want to see how pathetic
that degenerate is.

561
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,670
And I'm good.

562
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:16,510
I'm so good.

563
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:22,070
Alçiçek, take care of Savcı.

564
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:23,550
Yes, Halime Sultan.

565
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:45,990
Alas!

566
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:51,430
The kind of business the Great Seljuk Emir
was after is unbelievable.

567
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,550
Turns out he served the enemy.

568
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,990
My sultan, Sul...

569
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,230
My sultan.

570
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:32,750
The soldiers raided my mansion.

571
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:36,470
They brought me here without
giving me any information.

572
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:41,550
You don't even let me kiss your skirt.

573
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:45,110
I see a rage

574
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:48,630
in your eyes bigger than
the rage you have for your enemies.

575
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:54,630
What did I do to deserve this treatment,
my sultan?

576
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,590
Because you've been...

577
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:01,030
even worse than my enemies, Nizamettin.

578
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:06,310
-My sultan...
-Your betrayal came out of the chest!

579
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:17,630
The poisonous arrow that came out of it
missed me

580
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:22,830
but it killed a soldier of mine
and my trust for you.

581
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:28,950
I swear to God that I didn't put those
things in the chest, my sultan.

582
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,190
How would I know about those
devils’ inventions?

583
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:39,590
I sent you the manuscripts
of your favorite poets.

584
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:46,070
The chest was received
right in front of me.

585
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:48,310
It was placed in the room
right in front of me.

586
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:51,470
And it was moved out of the room
right in front me.

587
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:59,350
I'm not a traitor, my sultan.

588
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,910
If you're not a traitor, explain these.

589
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,950
They found these in your mansion!

590
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:14,470
Letters to the emperor
and the tekfur of Bilecik.

591
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:20,350
You wrote about the army's condition,
the number of soldiers,

592
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:24,190
the route of the campaign and everything!

593
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:32,030
Moreover, they told you where to get
the poison to kill me!

594
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,110
This is an ambush, my sultan.

595
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:46,670
The letters are an ambush!
The chest is an ambush!

596
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,950
Shame on you, Nizamettin!

597
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:05,030
I dedicated my life to serve you,
my sultan.

598
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,590
My father served your father,

599
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:10,950
my grandfather served your grandfather.

600
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,230
When your brother İzzettin...

601
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:17,830
got you arrested and put you in prison,

602
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,910
I served eight years in prison so
I wouldn't leave you on your own.

603
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:28,070
I was there with you...

604
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:31,350
at the Battle of Alaiye,

605
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:35,190
the Battle of Yassıçemen and many more.

606
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:44,790
My body is full of the scars of arrow
and sword blows...

607
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:47,670
I took for you.

608
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:58,870
This is the doings of the snakes
that hide in the state, my sultan.

609
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,670
I'm not the one who wanted to poison you,

610
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:08,430
they are.

611
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:26,830
The state's traditions can
forgive anything...

612
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:29,990
except betrayal.

613
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:36,270
For this cause,
fathers disregard their sons,

614
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:38,790
and brothers disregard each other.

615
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:45,550
You took advantage of the exceptions
I provided you,

616
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:48,550
and imagined yourself
in the sultan's position.

617
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:54,510
But two swords do not fit in one sheath.

618
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:00,110
I am the only sword in this state!

619
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:06,510
The reign and the power are mine!

620
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:08,430
You'll pay for it!

621
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:16,390
Take him to the dungeon!

622
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:19,270
He'll rot in the dungeon until...

623
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:24,350
he gives up the names of his allies.

624
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:29,190
My sultan, your sword is about to
take the head of the wrong person.

625
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:31,590
You're throwing your state into the fire!

626
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:09,150
Every cloud has a silver lining,
my sultan.

627
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:18,030
Luckily, you exposed the traitors
before they could...

628
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:20,710
harm you or the state.

629
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:32,510
Now, if you'll excuse me.

630
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:25,750
Degenerate scumbag.

631
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,550
Finally, you fell into the trap
that you set up.

632
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:36,150
You got what you deserved.

633
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:02,750
You have been so evil that...

634
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:05,910
even if I tore your head off
with my bare hands,

635
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:07,230
I wouldn't feel better.

636
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:11,750
I put my feet on...

637
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:15,550
your head in the castle
that you took shelter in

638
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:18,150
once upon a time.

639
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:23,510
All evil people like you
will end up the same.

640
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:28,430
Kill me, Ertuğrul!

641
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:30,710
Kill me!

642
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:33,870
Don't waste your breath!

643
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,350
We've got more stuff to do.

644
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,990
You'll tell me everything you know.

645
01:18:45,070 --> 01:18:46,830
If you resist,

646
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:50,630
I'll make you talk until you start
bleeding from your mouth.

647
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:56,990
Take him away.

648
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:23,230
<i>Maybe the reign will go on</i>
<i>with ingratitude, however,</i>

649
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:26,110
<i>it'll never go on with cruelty.</i>

650
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:31,750
Such wise words, Great Vizier Nizamülmülk.

651
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:38,430
May God protect us from cruelty
and from being cruel.

652
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:44,030
<i>Can I come in, my sultan?</i>

653
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:47,310
Come in.

654
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:03,550
What's going on Aziz? Is something wrong?

655
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:08,790
Speak!

656
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,470
I'm coming from the dungeon.

657
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,030
Emir Nizamettin.

658
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:21,350
Emir Nizamettin killed himself, my sultan.

659
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:29,630
What do you mean he killed himself?
How could this happen?

660
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:32,590
I'm one of the dungeon guards, my sultan.

661
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,390
He drank poison and killed himself.

662
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,230
The doctor is examining the emir's body.

663
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:43,430
Tell the doctor and Emir Sadettin
to come here right away!

664
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:44,990
Now!

665
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:37,870
Kill me, Ertuğrul. Finish this.

666
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:41,870
Don't rush it.

667
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,270
I'll give you an opportunity
to escape your death.

668
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:52,790
I'll take you to Konya.

669
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:57,270
You'll tell Sultan Alaeddin

670
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:01,550
about your alliance with Emir Sadettin.

671
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:08,350
Explain to me, how did this happen?

672
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:14,550
He had poison in his ring, my sultan.

673
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:18,750
He mixed the poison with water
and killed himself.

674
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:24,030
This is the same kind of poison
that killed

675
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:25,670
your soldier, my sultan.

676
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,030
Traitor!

677
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:38,390
He must have realized that he was exposed

678
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:41,830
and there was no way for him
to save himself.

679
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:48,710
So he killed himself.

680
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:50,710
There's more, my sultan.

681
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:56,310
This is the same poison they used when
they wanted to kill you in Hanlı Bazaar.

682
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:09,830
Nizamettin.

683
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:12,190
Why would he want to kill me?

684
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:19,950
Ambition for power blinded him, my sultan.

685
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:25,030
He wanted to take over the reign
by killing you

686
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:28,230
and causing a fit between your children.

687
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:30,830
There's no other explanation.

688
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:33,310
Traitor!

689
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:43,070
You worked with Emir Sadettin
on the trap you set up for me and my Alps

690
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:47,590
while we were on our sultan’s campaign,

691
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:51,910
and on the sale of Hanlı Bazaar.

692
01:23:53,870 --> 01:24:00,230
If you confess this in the sultan's
presence, I'll let you live.

693
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:03,390
I am...

694
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:06,950
a knight that took an oath for my empire,

695
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:09,390
and our holy cause, Ertuğrul.

696
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:12,630
I would never do something that serves
you or your state.

697
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:18,750
I will not say a word.

698
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:25,110
Neither your empire nor your cause
can save you.

699
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:30,830
I walked all over your knighthood.

700
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:36,630
You're nothing now.
You only have your worthless life left.

701
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:40,870
And if you have some intelligence left,

702
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:43,950
you'll do as I say and save yourself.

703
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:52,510
Otherwise, tomorrow morning
I'll execute you in front of your people

704
01:24:53,150 --> 01:24:56,390
and announce the kind of degenerate
that you are.

705
01:24:58,030 --> 01:25:00,270
Your people will spit in your face.

706
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:05,390
You'll die with the curse of your people.

707
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:13,310
You can't do that to me, Ertuğrul!
I don't deserve that!

708
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:24,310
You don't deserve that?

709
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:32,590
Think about it until sunrise.

710
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:38,710
If you can't save yourself by morning,
you never will.

711
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,390
I'd die for you.

712
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:29,470
Karacahisar is conquered.

713
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:32,630
And the degenerate Ares is captured.

714
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,470
My mother's health is okay.

715
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,030
We'll have much better days, Mother.

716
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:41,630
God willing, Daughter.

717
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,470
Don't get up, Mother.

718
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:48,910
How are you? Is everything okay?

719
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:52,630
I'm fine, Son. You look tired.

720
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:54,350
I'm okay, Mother.

721
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:57,910
I was just with the degenerate Ares.

722
01:26:58,670 --> 01:26:59,950
I'm done with him.

723
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:03,790
But the future of our state is ambiguous.

724
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:09,110
Why do you say that?

725
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:13,670
Sit down, Mother.
I've got things to tell you.

726
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:15,710
It's time for you to hear about them.

727
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:29,590
The worms of a tree come from within.

728
01:27:31,190 --> 01:27:34,950
And our glorious state is weakened
by traitors within.

729
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:39,350
Not only is our state under threat,

730
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:41,870
but also our villages.

731
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:46,790
When have we lacked traitors?

732
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:51,470
They either deceive the sultan
or set the Şehzades against each other.

733
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:56,030
Thank God, the roots of our tree
are solid, my bey.

734
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:00,390
After today, no one can cause us harm.

735
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:03,110
This time it's worse, Halime.

736
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:06,630
Our sultan got poisoned,

737
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:10,110
my Alps and I were trapped,

738
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:13,150
Turgut and Aslıhan were poisoned,

739
01:28:13,550 --> 01:28:16,030
and same people were behind all of these:

740
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:21,030
the emir of our state,
Emir Sadettin Köpek.

741
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:23,830
Emir Sadettin?

742
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:29,070
We all know how sinister he is.

743
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,790
However, how could a great emir...

744
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:34,830
be this corrupt, son?

745
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:42,190
My bey, you're talking about
the poisoning of our sultan.

746
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:46,070
That kind of evil is irredeemable.

747
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,270
Do you have a proof?

748
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:51,830
I have proof, my Halime.

749
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:54,670
But it's not enough.

750
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:58,070
The degenerate Ares knows everything.

751
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:02,190
If he confesses to the sultan
what he knows,

752
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:04,430
everything will come out.

753
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:10,070
Our state will get rid
of the traitor Köpek.

754
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:15,230
But Ares says he won't
confess anything.

755
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:18,790
So what are you going to do, Son?

756
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:22,190
I gave him time to think
until the morning.

757
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:25,990
If he doesn't confess,

758
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:29,550
I'll give him the necessary punishment
in front of his people.

759
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:35,430
And then I'll go to Konya to talk
to the sultan about what I know.

760
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:38,190
Oh, for God's sake, Ertuğrul.

761
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:41,070
How will you prove it to him
if Ares won't talk?

762
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:43,990
You know that as much as I do.

763
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:46,270
The palace is a lion's den.

764
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:49,990
God knows how many more Emir Sadettins
are there.

765
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:55,350
If you can't prove it, God forbid,

766
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,790
they will harm you badly.

767
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:03,310
We will do whatever we can to prevent
Emir Sadettin from succeeding, my Halime.

768
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:07,790
If we submit to Sadettin's games,

769
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:11,150
then our state will fail.

770
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:16,430
If we can't be as brave as the traitors,
shame on us.

771
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:22,430
To take care of the state is more
important than our own lives.

772
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:27,790
You'll come to Konya with me, Halime.

773
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:30,110
Whatever you want, my bey.

774
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:33,430
Son, you're on a tough journey again.

775
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,910
May God give you the strength...

776
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:40,150
to pass the deep waters
and cross the grand mountains.

777
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:42,310
Amen, Mother. Amen.

778
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:48,430
If we lose the state,
traditions will go astray.

779
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:52,990
It's time to clean the state of those
who disregard tradition.

780
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:59,430
If you'll excuse me,

781
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:02,510
I'll go see Muhyiddin Ibn Al Arabi,
Mother.

782
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:36,550
Peace be with you.

783
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:39,830
Peace be upon you. Go ahead, son.

784
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:53,070
With the help of God,
you defeated the ambushers.

785
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:55,430
Thank God.

786
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:59,110
But you couldn't get rid of the ambushers
in your mind.

787
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:02,350
Sing your heart out so you can feel peace.

788
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:09,790
The mad horses in my mind
are taking me to faraway lands.

789
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:11,990
What do you see in those lands?

790
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:16,190
Giant plane trees, mad stallions.

791
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:19,430
Sails that tame the waves.

792
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:22,430
Keys to many cities.

793
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:26,190
So what worries you?

794
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:29,190
Those mad stallions whisper in my ear.

795
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:30,870
What do they say?

796
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:32,030
They say...

797
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:36,150
"Plant a seed so it can become a plane
tree when it grows.

798
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:39,790
And that plane's shade can cover
all over the world.

799
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:42,110
So your state can exist."

800
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:46,270
May God grant these kinds
of stallions to everyone.

801
01:32:48,990 --> 01:32:50,510
How can we establish this state?

802
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:54,070
What kind of qualities does that person
have to have?

803
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:58,150
Do I have those qualities?

804
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:02,630
First of all, a state is not a post,

805
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:06,590
a position, a sultan, a king

806
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:08,670
nor a khan.

807
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:12,470
A state is about the mind and the heart.

808
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:18,750
A clear mind and heart are what makes
a body human,

809
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:22,830
and what makes a state is the qualities
of its people.

810
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:27,870
The more qualities people have,

811
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:30,830
the better the state will be.

812
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:35,350
That's why they say to keep your people
alive so the state can live.

813
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:42,950
Brave people and quality people
make powerful nations.

814
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:49,710
Among them, good viziers, commanders,
scholars and students will come out...

815
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:53,350
and altogether, you'll have a grand state.

816
01:33:56,910 --> 01:33:59,870
So what kind of qualities should...

817
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:03,110
their leader have?

818
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:06,710
The head is the commander
that moves the body.

819
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:10,190
The head has the eyes,
the ears and the mouth.

820
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:13,710
For a body to be healthy, the head
should be intact.

821
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:15,910
He should be merciful.

822
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:17,470
He should be fair.

823
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:19,190
He should be fair.

824
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:22,110
He should be decisive and determined.

825
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:27,310
He'll think about the welfare
of the people before himself.

826
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:31,590
He'll make his people have new dreams.

827
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:36,390
His people's problems will be his.

828
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:42,910
So what destroys a state?

829
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:47,430
Almighty God commands, in the Quran,

830
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:52,790
"People! God’s promise is true,

831
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:55,710
so do not let the present life
deceive you.

832
01:34:56,510 --> 01:35:01,070
Do not let the Deceiver
deceive you about God."

833
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:05,710
The Devil plays lots of tricks
to destroy a state.

834
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:09,750
The blind Devil instils unfairness
into the people.

835
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,390
He makes the bribery seem sweet.

836
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:16,310
He whispers that the inadequacy
is the reality.

837
01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:19,990
Everyone cares only about themselves...

838
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:23,350
and forgets about the problems
of their people.

839
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:28,350
By then, the people get so unruly that...

840
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:33,910
they don't listen to their sultans,
they don't follow traditions...

841
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:37,830
and they stop following God's orders.

842
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:44,350
God forbid.

843
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:49,670
{\an8}God forbid.

844
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:09,120
<i>Holy God, I trust you and Titan,</i>
<i>and no one else, to save my life.</i>

845
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,960
<i>I have to look like I've surrendered</i>
<i>to Ertuğrul.</i>

846
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:18,880
<i>Help my friend Titan to find and save me</i>
<i>before I get to Konya.</i>

847
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,240
It's time, Ares.

848
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:51,040
Where is Ertuğrul Bey?

849
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:55,440
We'll take you to the bazaar,
before your own people.

850
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:58,040
You'll see Ertuğrul Bey there, Ares.

851
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,640
Stop.

852
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:02,320
I wish to see Ertuğrul Bey first.

853
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,520
Tell your bey.

854
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:07,800
I have something important to say.

855
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:26,960
The emperor and the governor of Bilecik
will attack from the north

856
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:31,000
with all their power to take back
the Karacahisar Castle.

857
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:35,440
They will attack the Kayi
and the Cavdar villages, my bey.

858
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,800
Those are the strongest Turkish tribes.

859
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:44,040
If we fall, the Turkish tribes
lose their leadership.

860
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:48,680
That's exactly why I want these two tribes
to unite.

861
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:56,680
Good. My bey, the Cavdars are numerous,
but they are more liable to be attacked.

862
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:01,600
Also, the pastures at the Cavdar village
won't suffice for both our herds.

863
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:07,640
The location of the Kayis is stronger,
and we have wider pastures.

864
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:11,160
Looks like you're very happy about this.

865
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:14,880
Of course. Why shouldn't I be?
God willing, we'll be one.

866
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,200
Bamsi is right, my bey.

867
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,040
It would be best for the Cavdars
to move to the Kayi village.

868
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:27,280
I'll tell my people about the situation
and prepare them to migrate.

869
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,080
Thanks, Turgut.

870
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,480
Artuk Bey, send the alps.

871
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,160
Tell them to find places for the Cavdars
in the Kayi village.

872
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,080
As you order, my bey.

873
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:43,680
Let's not keep Ares and the people
waiting for the execution.

874
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,200
My bey, Ares wants to speak to you.

875
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,960
Let's see if his mouth has opened.

876
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:08,920
Bring him, Dumrul.

877
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,640
As you order, my bey.

878
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,160
Ares, Ares.

879
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:27,960
Ares, Ares.

880
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,600
Victory and defeat are normal in war.

881
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,240
Ares was defeated.

882
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,040
Let's hope that he's alive.

883
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,800
So, we'll have a hope of saving him.

884
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:11,080
No matter what,
you'll lead the war for our Empire, Titan.

885
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:19,200
Don't drive us to doom by being a slave
to your rage for Ertuğrul like Ares.

886
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:25,360
The sultan gave Söğüt and Domaniç
to Ertuğrul just like Karacahisar.

887
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:34,200
We can't let Ertuğrul have them.

888
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:39,600
-If they settle there today--
-Tomorrow they'll have Bilecik and Nicaea.

889
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,320
Damn it.

890
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,320
News from the castle, sir.

891
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:10,120
-Ertuğrul didn't kill Ares.
-Where is he now?

892
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,960
In the castle's dungeon.

893
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:18,200
He is to be executed.

894
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:22,200
-Did your spy send this?
-Yes.

895
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,080
-Who is that man?
-Not a man, a woman.

896
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,160
You'll meet her soon.

897
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,400
She'll tell you
what happens at the castle.

898
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:02,240
This sword that you treacherously stole
from me will take your head soon Ares.

899
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,000
Not today, Ertuğrul Bey.

900
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,040
Not today.

901
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,160
Speak, then.

902
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,400
I accept your offer.

903
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:21,840
I'll talk.

904
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,880
If you don't execute me,
I'll tell Sultan Alaeddin everything.

905
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:37,080
Fear of death brought you to your senses.

906
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:43,160
I can't give my life for your state
or for a man like Emir Sadettin.

907
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:48,560
Take him back to the dungeon.

908
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,040
As you order.

909
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:58,480
Door!

910
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,520
If Titan learns
that we're taking Ares to Konya,

911
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:05,800
he'll pursue us.

912
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:09,640
We'll take him out secretly.

913
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:15,640
We'll travel to Konya in such ways
that nobody will even guess.

914
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,400
The problem isn't just Titan.

915
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:23,720
Emir Sadettin.

916
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,160
He'll know why I'm taking Ares to Konya.

917
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:34,600
Then, he'll do anything to prevent me
from showing Ares to the sultan.

918
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:52,080
You called for me, my sultan.

919
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,320
The threat in the palace is gone.

920
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:04,720
But something worries me.

921
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,760
What is it, my sultan?

922
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:21,320
Successive attempts to poison me
have worried me, Sadettin.

923
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,680
I don't fear death.

924
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,600
I fear for my state.

925
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:36,640
The Mongols wish to invade the South
just like they did in the East

926
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,200
to encircle us and kill us.

927
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,600
They'll capture the Islamic states too.

928
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,320
The whole Islamic world.

929
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,920
They await our weakest moment.

930
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,120
They'll aim for us at the first chance.

931
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,760
May God never take you away from us,
my Sultan.

932
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,600
I'll die sooner or later, Sadettin.

933
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:11,520
But dying unexpectedly,
that's what scares me.

934
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,440
That's why I have to choose my heir.

935
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:20,560
Isn't that decided, my sultan?

936
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,640
Your elder son Gıyaseddin--

937
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:27,640
No. I wish for my younger son Kılıçarslan
to succeed me.

938
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:38,840
Why, my sultan?

939
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:42,520
Why would you want this?

940
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,400
If Kılıçarslan, the son I had with
the Ayyubid princess, becomes Sultan

941
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:54,400
he'll be able to unite the Islamic world
against the Mongols.

942
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,040
Then, Ertuğrul...

943
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:03,720
Ertuğrul?

944
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:08,480
What does Ertuğrul have to do with this?

945
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:14,600
I know that the Turkish tribes
under Ertuğrul will soon conquer

946
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,160
Bilecik and even Nicaea.

947
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:24,040
I wish for him to be responsible
for the lands he conquers

948
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:26,520
even after my death.

949
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:36,680
That's why I can't leave him
or the state up to fate.

950
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,520
I'll issue a decree.

951
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:46,200
Also, I'll put an important commander
and a regiment of the state

952
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:47,920
to Ertuğrul's service.

953
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,560
Yakup Bey would be...

954
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,680
great for this duty, my sultan.

955
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,400
Where is he?

956
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,840
He is in Ahlat, by your order.

957
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:10,760
Then tell him to come to my palace
when Ertuğrul Bey comes.

958
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:15,280
I'll order him and his troops
to serve under Ertuğrul Bey

959
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:18,720
to protect and maintain
the Karacahisar Castle.

960
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,520
Well thought, my sultan.

961
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:26,400
When I return, I'll announce my heir.

962
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,960
As you wish, my sultan.

963
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,440
Excuse me.

964
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,920
Bamsi, choose a group of alps.

965
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,640
Tell them to go ahead and check the road.

966
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:07,720
Tell them to let us know
if they see any dangers.

967
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:08,840
As you order, my bey.

968
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:13,720
Organize the Cavdar Tribe's migration
while we're in Konya, Turgut.

969
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:15,840
As you order, my bey.

970
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:19,000
Halime Hatun will accompany me to Konya.

971
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:23,320
It would be appropriate.
Until we return...

972
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:27,000
Bamsi will protect the Kayi Tribe,

973
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:29,440
Turgut, the Cavdar Tribe,

974
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:32,520
and Artuk Bey,
the castle and the Hanlı Bazaar.

975
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:33,800
All right, my bey.

976
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,040
You asked for me, Your Highness.

977
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:23,960
Göktuğ, take this letter to
Commander Yakup Bey at Ahlat, quickly.

978
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,120
When will Prince Gıyaseddin
and his mother Mahperi Hatun

979
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,480
come back from Alaiye?

980
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,760
I heard that they're coming to Konya
to see the sultan

981
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:37,800
before he leaves for war.

982
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,440
And his tutor, Altun Aba?

983
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,800
He accompanies Prince Gıyaseddin
and his mother.

984
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:44,960
Good.

985
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,760
Let's see what they'll do when they learn
that the sultan

986
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:54,960
casts away the tradition and chooses
his younger son, Kılıçarslan, as his heir.

987
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:59,360
At the end, we'll surely get what we want,
Your Highness.

988
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,960
Go, take the letter to Ahlat quickly.

989
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:09,960
Yakup Bey will be the biggest problem
I send to Ertuğrul at Karacahisar.

990
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:25,120
I feel your pain, son.

991
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:31,520
You control your desires for
the well-being of the state.

992
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:33,880
It's the right thing.

993
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:37,280
God will surely help you.

994
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,880
Don't worry about me, Mother.
Don't exhaust yourself.

995
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:46,600
If you need anything while I'm gone,
Artuk Bey is always here.

996
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:49,840
Don't worry about us, Son.

997
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,400
I'm fine.

998
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:55,440
I'll wait for your brother to get
to the castle.

999
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,000
<i>Inshallah</i>, Mother.

1000
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,200
Who knows, maybe my brother will arrive
before I do.

1001
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,800
<i>Inshallah</i>, my son.

1002
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,280
Mother...

1003
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:18,080
If I don't return,
I ask for your blessing.

1004
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:26,040
Anything for you, my son.

1005
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,520
Thanks, Mother.

1006
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,840
My strong little lion.

1007
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:44,520
Father, can't I come along?

1008
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:46,640
What do you say?

1009
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:49,120
Who will protect this huge castle?

1010
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:53,880
There's Bamsi Alp, Turgut Alp
and many other alps.

1011
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,520
What will I do?

1012
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:59,680
They're only alps, you're the chief alp.

1013
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:03,440
A bey's son must lead those alps.

1014
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:07,880
When your mother and I are gone,
you'll protect the castle.

1015
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:09,400
As you order, my bey.

1016
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:11,240
I'm so proud of you.

1017
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:14,600
My son.

1018
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:43,760
Time to go, Ares.

1019
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:55,720
<i>I hope you can save me soon, Titan.</i>

1020
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,280
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

1021
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:23,800
Good day.

1022
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:11,600
Farewell, Mother.

1023
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:14,600
Godspeed, Son. May God protect you.

1024
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,360
Godspeed, Sister.

1025
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:23,440
-Hafsa...
-Safe travels.

1026
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:27,400
Before, you would only protect the village
and the tent, Gündüz.

1027
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,360
Now you protect the castle.

1028
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:33,120
Tell me everything when I return.

1029
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:35,280
Don't worry, my bey.

1030
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,680
My dear son.

1031
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:46,720
-May God protect you.
-May God protect you, dear.

1032
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:47,840
My bey.

1033
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,040
My Gündüz.

1034
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:58,960
-May God protect you.
-You too, Artuk Bey.

1035
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:07,360
My brave son.

1036
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:13,200
Look after your brother Savcı.
Look after him well.

1037
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,160
Come back soon, okay, Mother?
We'll wait for you.

1038
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:36,800
May God protect you.

1039
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:40,640
-Are the other alps ready?
-They're ready.

1040
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,400
They await at the secret passage.

1041
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:45,760
Good. Go then.

1042
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,920
Let's go.

1043
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,120
-May God protect you.
-Thank you.

1044
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,440
Come on.

1045
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:33,080
Go and return swiftly.

1046
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Alps.

1047
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,000
<i>I pass as his prisoner</i>

1048
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:26,320
<i>through the passage I built</i>
<i>to beat Ertuğrul.</i>

1049
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:22,480
Our spy at the castle sent this.

1050
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,000
Ertuğrul is taking Ares to Konya.

1051
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,800
Ares saved his skin by telling everything
he knows to the sultan.

1052
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,720
This can't be true.

1053
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:44,200
Our spy heard this from Ertuğrul's
right hand, Artuk Bey, himself.

1054
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:49,880
Ares...

1055
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,120
He must be waiting to be rescued.

1056
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:00,240
We must save him before he gets to Konya.

1057
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:05,120
Ertuğrul will take all the precautions
when taking him to Konya.

1058
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:08,880
They'll use the back roads.

1059
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:13,200
They're already on the road.

1060
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:16,960
We'll never find them.

1061
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:21,160
Don't worry, Titan.

1062
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:27,080
Ertuğrul will surely set Ares free
once he talks.

1063
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:31,440
Now, what we should think about

1064
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:37,240
is how to beat Ertuğrul
and how to stop the Turks.

1065
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:44,440
If Ertuğrul is gone,
we'll attack more in his absence.

1066
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:48,080
But I won't use peasant soldiers,

1067
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:53,360
I'll use real mercenaries.

1068
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:59,520
Ares will surely find us when he's free.

1069
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:01,920
I hope so.

1070
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:06,560
Now tell me,
who sends all this information?

1071
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:10,360
Who's this woman spy?

1072
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,640
Marya, Artuk Bey's wife.

1073
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:02,680
Günkut, Abdur Rahman.

1074
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:08,600
Don't leave Ares out of your sights
until we get to Konya.

1075
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:12,200
I'm no ordinary prisoner, Ertuğrul Bey.

1076
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:16,560
I'm a governor.
Don't forget this on the road to Konya.

1077
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:19,240
Tie his hands and feet.

1078
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:23,200
If he speaks, tie his mouth too.

1079
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:27,640
Come on, wife.

1080
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:19,120
Come on, alps.

1081
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:20,960
Come on, wife.

1082
02:04:29,872 --> 02:05:10,605
