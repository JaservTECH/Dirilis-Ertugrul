1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Episode 119 will start after 12:20 min.

2
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,166
Noyan!

3
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:06,966
Attack!

4
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:31,566
My Bey, Bamsi is wounded on the ground!

5
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:40,286
We must get rid of them at once
and get help for Bamsi!

6
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:42,006
Damn it!

7
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,326
Instead of lying down on the battlefield,

8
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,206
I'd rather fight while bleeding.

9
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:19,246
My Bey...

10
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:26,886
-Bamsi!
-Brother!

11
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:32,766
Bamsi! My lion!

12
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:36,166
Bamsi, say something. Brother, speak up.

13
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,526
Bamsi! Bamsi, are you alright?

14
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:41,006
Huh?

15
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,606
Well, well, well!

16
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,646
You are trying to escape
while your knights are dying, huh?

17
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:56,486
Look, let me go.
Then, come to the Bilecik Castle.

18
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:58,406
I'll give you anything.

19
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:02,046
Okay.

20
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:03,886
Deal.

21
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:13,966
But what I want is your head.

22
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,206
And you can't give it to me.

23
00:16:18,966 --> 00:16:20,286
But I can take it.

24
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:26,486
My Bey...

25
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:30,126
I would've been so upset

26
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:33,246
if I had been lying down
on the battlefield.

27
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:35,646
My lion.

28
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:38,686
My lion.

29
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:42,726
Abdur Rahman. We need to take Bamsi
and the others to the caravansary at once.

30
00:16:42,966 --> 00:16:44,246
As you order, my Bey.

31
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:45,926
You'll get better, brother.

32
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:47,846
You'll get better.

33
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,566
Look what I brought.

34
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:17,086
Stop there, Noyan!

35
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:18,806
Why would I do that, huh?

36
00:17:19,726 --> 00:17:25,366
He betrayed Ertuğrul Bey,
he should be the one to punish him.

37
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:35,926
You can keep using
the damned dagger of betrayal,

38
00:17:39,966 --> 00:17:41,766
we'll keep using
the sword of the righteous.

39
00:17:44,526 --> 00:17:48,926
We will bleed you and create
an ocean of blood

40
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,526
until you stop your betrayal.

41
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:06,726
Head Alp Bamsi!

42
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:09,406
Head Alp Bamsi!

43
00:18:10,326 --> 00:18:12,806
My Bey! My Bey, Head Alp Bamsi passed out.

44
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:20,806
Bamsi! My brother!

45
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:22,766
My lion! Open your eyes!

46
00:18:24,926 --> 00:18:26,646
Bamsi, open your eyes.

47
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:32,766
Be quick! We need to go
to the caravansary.

48
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:33,886
<i>-Bismillah.</i>
-Bamsi...

49
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:35,806
-Come on.
-Come on.

50
00:18:35,886 --> 00:18:38,126
-Come on!
-Come on, brothers.

51
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:47,806
Oh my girl, Sugay.

52
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:49,966
Where are you, my girl?

53
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:51,526
Where are you?

54
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,526
<i>May I come in?</i>

55
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:56,486
Come in, Artuk Bey.

56
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:02,166
Artuk Bey...

57
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:05,126
Sugay Hatun wanted
to visit her child's tomb.

58
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:08,046
I allowed it and sent two alps with her.

59
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:09,886
It has been quite a while

60
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:13,286
but neither Sugay Hatun
nor the alps are back.

61
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,086
This can't be good.

62
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:19,966
My Osman is crying inside,
he needs to be fed.

63
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:22,686
Did she tell you
where the tomb is, Hayme Hatun?

64
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:24,566
I shall send alps after them at once.

65
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:26,646
<i>Mother Hayme, may I come in?</i>

66
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:28,166
Come in, Dumrul.

67
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:34,046
He barely made it to the tribe.

68
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,366
He wants to talk to you.

69
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:39,406
Have him sit.

70
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,246
Son, what happened to you?

71
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,046
Where are the other alps and Sugay Hatun?

72
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,086
They kidnapped Sugay Hatun, Mother Hayme.

73
00:19:50,326 --> 00:19:51,446
What?

74
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:53,206
Who did it?

75
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,206
I don't know, my Artuk Bey.

76
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:57,446
Their faces were covered.

77
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:01,446
The other alp became a martyr.

78
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:03,966
I couldn't stop them, my Bey.

79
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:05,606
Oh my God!

80
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:09,406
Günkut, Dumrul.

81
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,526
Inform the alps right away.

82
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:13,526
Have them search everywhere.

83
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:16,126
No one is to come back
until Sugay Hatun is found.

84
00:20:16,326 --> 00:20:18,446
-As you command.
-As you command, Artuk Bey.

85
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:20,486
Let's get him to the infirmary tent.

86
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:27,646
Who are they?

87
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:30,366
What do they want from Sugay Hatun?

88
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:34,526
My God!

89
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:37,926
Please help us.

90
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:42,286
Help us.

91
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:03,726
The Mongols!

92
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:06,966
Please show mercy! I'm at your service!

93
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:08,846
Please spare our lives!

94
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,206
Please don't hurt us.

95
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:14,886
Innkeeper!

96
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,686
I am Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

97
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:19,326
The Mongols are with me.

98
00:21:19,406 --> 00:21:20,486
Welcome, my Bey.

99
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:22,566
Get us hot water and some cloth at once.

100
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:24,006
Hurry, Eftelya!

101
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:27,046
Get hot water and cloth for Ertuğrul Bey!

102
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:30,526
Hurry, Eftelya! Run!

103
00:21:31,126 --> 00:21:32,526
Come on, be quick!

104
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:41,326
We need to take care of the wound.

105
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:43,286
We must stop the bleeding.

106
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,886
-It's all right!
-Where is the hot water?

107
00:21:46,966 --> 00:21:48,486
Here, my Bey!

108
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:51,206
Be quick! My soldiers are wounded!

109
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:56,606
Hang in there, my lion!

110
00:22:30,286 --> 00:22:32,606
You'll recover, my brother.

111
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:35,206
See, I'm cleaning the wound
with my own hands.

112
00:22:37,366 --> 00:22:39,566
They say a brother's hand heals
the others so fast.

113
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:41,766
Of course.

114
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:43,446
Come on, brother.

115
00:22:43,806 --> 00:22:45,086
Come on, open your eyes.

116
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:06,446
Don't think I owe you my life
just because you saved me.

117
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:09,366
I saved you because we are on a mission.

118
00:23:10,326 --> 00:23:12,566
Apart from that,
I couldn't possibly care less.

119
00:23:28,486 --> 00:23:29,646
Ertuğrul Bey...

120
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:32,966
We'd like to take care of the wounded
if you allow us, my Bey.

121
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:34,286
Very well, innkeeper.

122
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:36,686
Abdur Rahman!

123
00:23:37,286 --> 00:23:39,726
You go outside and guard the place
with the other alps.

124
00:23:40,206 --> 00:23:41,406
As you order, my Bey!

125
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:54,606
You'll get better, brother.

126
00:23:56,006 --> 00:23:57,166
You'll get better.

127
00:24:00,046 --> 00:24:01,526
Come on, my lion.

128
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:03,966
Come on, my brother!

129
00:25:35,806 --> 00:25:37,446
What are they doing here?

130
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:39,406
What's up, Dumrul?

131
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:41,766
Sugay Hatun was kidnapped, Günalp Bey.

132
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:43,166
Sugay Hatun?

133
00:25:43,486 --> 00:25:44,566
Who did it?

134
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,046
We are not sure.

135
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:48,486
Sugay Hatun left the tribe
to visit her child's tomb.

136
00:25:48,686 --> 00:25:50,286
She had two alps with her.

137
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:53,606
Some unknown men attacked them.

138
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:57,006
One of the wounded alps came back
to the tribe and informed us.

139
00:25:57,326 --> 00:25:59,086
Sugay Hatun is missing.

140
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:01,886
Then, let's find her
before anything bad happens.

141
00:26:02,006 --> 00:26:03,486
Come on, Dumrul.

142
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,046
So, the wet nurse was kidnapped.

143
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:15,606
This information can be useful
for Alangoya.

144
00:26:23,726 --> 00:26:25,526
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

145
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,126
God, please help him.

146
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,286
God, please help him.

147
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:32,966
God, please help him.

148
00:27:01,326 --> 00:27:03,566
I hope he recovers by midnight.

149
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:05,166
God willing, my Bey.

150
00:27:05,886 --> 00:27:06,966
God willing.

151
00:27:19,886 --> 00:27:21,646
The demon is coming again, my Bey.

152
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:40,966
You are surrounded by your enemies
wherever you go, Ertuğrul.

153
00:27:44,806 --> 00:27:46,406
Even if you stay where you are,

154
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:50,446
someone of your blood line
tries to betray you.

155
00:28:03,926 --> 00:28:05,646
A tree's roots touch the ground...

156
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,526
no matter how tall it is.

157
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:11,446
Thank God,

158
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:17,406
we know for sure how to stand our ground
in situations like these.

159
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,886
But if you were
to join forces with Ögedei Khan...

160
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:31,126
Let alone conquering Nicaea,

161
00:28:31,446 --> 00:28:34,126
we could even have Constantinople
within our grasp.

162
00:28:37,246 --> 00:28:38,406
Do you really believe

163
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:42,606
that I would accept your Khan
as my leader, Noyan?

164
00:28:49,126 --> 00:28:52,886
Your kin and your state are about to end.

165
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,646
You're in deep trouble.

166
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:03,366
Various governors realize your situation
and each one tries to take a bite.

167
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:06,166
You won yesterday.

168
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:08,846
You also won today.

169
00:29:10,486 --> 00:29:12,926
But no one knows
what will happen tomorrow.

170
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:18,366
You neither have a place to run away,

171
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:21,406
nor a corner to take refuge.

172
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:26,406
During all your time with us,

173
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:29,846
haven't you realized
that we aren't afraid of the enemy, Noyan?

174
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:34,046
Ertuğrul, I say...

175
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,886
do what you do best
when the time comes.

176
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:41,886
Hold onto your swords and horses.

177
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,526
Ögedei Khan is like a wild river.

178
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,046
I say you should get in the river.

179
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:52,806
You shouldn't swim against the current.

180
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:58,126
You either join us and flow with us...

181
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:05,126
or you and your tribe
will vanish in the desert.

182
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:12,006
My Bey.

183
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:13,806
Bamsi is trying to say something.

184
00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:16,366
What is it, my lion?

185
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,686
Say it.

186
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:19,846
My brother...

187
00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:21,446
You'll get better, my brother.

188
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,166
Don't worry, we are with you.

189
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:25,046
My Bey...

190
00:30:26,886 --> 00:30:28,486
Don't you go without me, my Bey.

191
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:33,966
Would we ever do that, my lion?

192
00:30:34,606 --> 00:30:36,126
Goodness gracious.

193
00:30:37,206 --> 00:30:38,486
My Bey...

194
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:41,606
Don't leave me behind.

195
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:46,406
I won't let you go there without me.

196
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,086
Would I go on a journey
without you, brother?

197
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:50,766
Don't worry.

198
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:53,926
Ögedei can wait for us.

199
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:56,566
And we can't go anywhere without you.

200
00:30:58,846 --> 00:30:59,966
Much appreciated.

201
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:01,766
Thank you, my Bey.

202
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:06,086
Don't worry.

203
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:15,246
Let him rest, Turgut.

204
00:31:16,046 --> 00:31:17,486
Feed him when he wakes up.

205
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:18,966
As you command, my Bey.

206
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:21,126
As you command.

207
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,566
God, a thousand thanks to you.

208
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:53,606
Please help my brother, my God.

209
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:00,246
My Osman...

210
00:32:00,766 --> 00:32:02,046
My beautiful child.

211
00:32:02,246 --> 00:32:04,406
Please hang in there a little more.

212
00:32:04,566 --> 00:32:06,006
Hang in there, my brave child.

213
00:32:11,086 --> 00:32:14,166
God, please ease my Osman's burdens.

214
00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:18,886
I hope Sugay Hatun comes back
to the tribe safe and sound.

215
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,566
Please help us, God.

216
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:23,166
Help us.

217
00:32:26,286 --> 00:32:28,286
<i>May I come in, Hayme Hatun?</i>

218
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:30,166
Come in, my girl.

219
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:33,566
Oh, my beautiful baby.

220
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:37,886
What is it, my girl?

221
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:43,126
I heard about what happened.

222
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:47,246
I am terribly sorry.
I'd like to help if you allow me.

223
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,406
Thanks, my girl.

224
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:52,406
I've sent alps after them.

225
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:55,446
They will take care of the situation.

226
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:58,086
God willing, Hayme Hatun.

227
00:32:58,166 --> 00:33:00,446
But we'd like to do what we can.

228
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:06,206
I can't stand seeing Osman
suffering like this.

229
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:11,206
My brother Eynece knows
how to locate any living being.

230
00:33:12,486 --> 00:33:16,166
No one can escape him,
no matter where they go.

231
00:33:18,726 --> 00:33:20,566
God bless you, my girl.

232
00:33:21,006 --> 00:33:21,926
Thanks.

233
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:23,606
Don't worry, Hayme Hatun.

234
00:33:24,126 --> 00:33:26,846
We'll bring Sugay Hatun here,
safe and sound.

235
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:30,646
I hope so. I hope so, my girl.

236
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:33,686
My child...

237
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:45,446
Oh my lamb, my little lamb.

238
00:33:50,046 --> 00:33:53,526
Alcicek, find the woman
who breastfed my Osman in the past.

239
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:56,006
Tell her about the situation, go on.

240
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:57,846
Of course, Mother Hayme.

241
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,126
All right, it's okay my sweet child.

242
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:03,286
All right.

243
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:04,846
Okay.

244
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:08,966
Everything will be alright.

245
00:34:09,086 --> 00:34:10,926
Oh my sweet grandson.

246
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:12,326
My sweetie.

247
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:40,646
We have the opportunity
to get rid of Günalp's doubts.

248
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:45,926
We must find and bring Sugay to the tribe,
no matter what.

249
00:34:47,526 --> 00:34:48,886
Don't worry, Alangoya.

250
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:50,526
You know...

251
00:34:50,606 --> 00:34:53,446
Mountains, hills, narrow passages...

252
00:34:54,646 --> 00:34:57,006
even the tree hollows
are Mergen's expertise.

253
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,686
We'll find her and bring her here.

254
00:35:08,926 --> 00:35:12,686
It'll help you gain more trust
in Mother Hayme's eyes.

255
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,606
Show me what you can do, then.

256
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:20,726
If we gain Günalp's trust,
we won't need to kill him.

257
00:35:21,526 --> 00:35:23,686
We can use him alive.

258
00:35:25,646 --> 00:35:28,406
But we will kill him
if he is not convinced.

259
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:30,726
Your wish is my command.

260
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:40,846
Come on!

261
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:13,526
My brave brother.

262
00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:15,806
Mother entrusted you to me.

263
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:21,526
Just be well.

264
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:25,766
I might not be able
to give you the warmth of my mother,

265
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:31,806
but I can always feed you
with my own hands.

266
00:36:33,086 --> 00:36:37,766
Don't you be afraid. I'm with you
even if my father isn't around.

267
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:42,046
I can protect both you and Osman.

268
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:56,246
I wish my mother was here

269
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,766
to see your beautiful gaze.

270
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:07,726
To hug you and kiss you.

271
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:18,006
Savci... Keep eating, my brother.

272
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,846
I won't drink anything you offer.

273
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:05,966
You wasted yourself
because of this disobedience.

274
00:38:06,846 --> 00:38:10,566
You refused to obey your husband's father
and caused his grandson to die.

275
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:14,006
My child is dead because of you, bastards!

276
00:38:15,406 --> 00:38:17,526
Don't even speak of my child.

277
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:20,726
That bastard who is my husband's father
can go to hell.

278
00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:22,006
Sugay!

279
00:38:22,326 --> 00:38:24,646
You are a bride
to a powerful Khwarazm bey.

280
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:28,326
If you refuse to obey him,
then you shall die.

281
00:38:29,086 --> 00:38:32,766
Actually, you deserve more
as you caused his grandson's death.

282
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:38,366
Our bey will severely punish you
once we get there.

283
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:54,766
Oh, God...

284
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,846
You are the protector of the oppressed.

285
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:01,686
You don't favor the oppressors.

286
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:11,046
Please grant me your help
to escape from these oppressors.

287
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:24,926
My Bey...

288
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:31,326
What I need is meat, not soup.

289
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:40,806
We let the innkeeper know.
Meat will be here any moment.

290
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:47,086
Would a bowl of soup be enough
for a mountain-like Bamsi?

291
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:48,206
Right.

292
00:39:56,246 --> 00:39:57,966
Oh, sister.

293
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,366
Thank you, sister.

294
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:01,886
Sister, you should...

295
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:07,646
You should bring more meat,
as it is my remedy.

296
00:40:11,126 --> 00:40:12,126
Thank you, sister.

297
00:40:14,886 --> 00:40:16,446
Here is your remedy.

298
00:40:17,006 --> 00:40:18,646
Come on, eat it, brother.

299
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:20,686
I...

300
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:23,646
I should eat it with my own hands.

301
00:40:23,846 --> 00:40:25,926
That'd be even more helpful, my Bey.

302
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,846
Very well then. Enjoy..

303
00:40:29,806 --> 00:40:30,926
Excuse me, my Bey.

304
00:40:31,366 --> 00:40:32,846
Go ahead, my lion.

305
00:40:59,006 --> 00:41:00,006
My Bey...

306
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,366
This guy obviously has a problem.

307
00:41:12,926 --> 00:41:17,246
He wants me to accept Ögedei
as my leader, Turgut.

308
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:34,126
Ögedei also has plans for Anatolia
as he marches for the Danube.

309
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:41,126
Noyan can arrogantly offer me this
because of Ögedei.

310
00:41:47,406 --> 00:41:49,006
The same offer

311
00:41:50,046 --> 00:41:54,886
must have been made
to the other Turkish tribes by now.

312
00:42:04,326 --> 00:42:07,246
Our Sultan is tired
of the pressure from the Mongols.

313
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,886
That's why he sent me as his envoy.

314
00:42:13,766 --> 00:42:14,766
Very well, my Bey.

315
00:42:26,246 --> 00:42:32,046
My Bey, what is in the bag
which was given to you by our sultan?

316
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:40,806
The salvation of our state, Turgut.

317
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:46,526
Very well, my Bey.

318
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:48,766
Understood.

319
00:42:54,486 --> 00:42:57,566
Eat. Come on, eat my lion.

320
00:43:24,206 --> 00:43:28,006
Mother Hayme, he refuses my milk
no matter what I do.

321
00:43:28,926 --> 00:43:31,206
I've never seen anything like this.

322
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:35,206
He got tired and went to sleep.

323
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:51,646
We need to find the woman
who has been feeding Osman.

324
00:43:52,686 --> 00:43:54,886
Obviously, Osman accepted her
as his mother.

325
00:44:00,366 --> 00:44:03,366
We will find her, my girl.

326
00:44:05,366 --> 00:44:07,166
You did what you could.

327
00:44:09,286 --> 00:44:10,806
God bless you.

328
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:14,406
May God help Osman, Mother Hayme.

329
00:44:14,926 --> 00:44:15,926
Amen.

330
00:44:17,966 --> 00:44:20,366
I'll stay in the tribe just in case.

331
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:25,166
-Excuse me.
-Goodbye, my girl.

332
00:44:35,566 --> 00:44:38,806
God works in mysterious ways.

333
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:45,646
Please watch over this child
and help him.

334
00:44:51,966 --> 00:44:55,566
Your capacity for mercy...

335
00:44:56,846 --> 00:44:58,846
and your ability have no boundaries.

336
00:45:04,006 --> 00:45:06,126
Please help us, my God.

337
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:10,166
Please help us, my God.

338
00:45:11,406 --> 00:45:13,286
Please help us, my God.

339
00:46:44,086 --> 00:46:47,046
What is it, Günalp Bey?
Did you find something?

340
00:46:47,486 --> 00:46:49,766
This probably belongs to Sugay Hatun.

341
00:46:53,046 --> 00:46:55,686
You are right, Günalp Bey.
This is Sugay Hatun's.

342
00:46:57,206 --> 00:46:59,126
It seems we are on the right track.

343
00:46:59,646 --> 00:47:01,006
Let's go quickly.

344
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:28,446
Time to go, get yourselves together.

345
00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:44,566
There is nowhere to run, Sugay.
And no one to save you.

346
00:47:46,286 --> 00:47:49,446
Now, our bey will severely punish you
once we get there.

347
00:47:50,526 --> 00:47:52,446
I hope it'll be God who punishes you.

348
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:07,526
God is good!

349
00:48:09,646 --> 00:48:11,526
Protect Sugay Hatun, brother.

350
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:18,806
Come on, brave warriors!

351
00:48:49,966 --> 00:48:51,246
Behind you!

352
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:23,486
We are here to help, alps!

353
00:50:07,206 --> 00:50:08,286
Are you okay?

354
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,566
Thank you, you came to help again.

355
00:50:14,926 --> 00:50:18,606
We all live on the same lands
and drink the same water.

356
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:22,006
It's our duty, Günalp Bey.

357
00:50:22,526 --> 00:50:26,846
We need to protect and respect each other.
Am I correct?

358
00:50:28,286 --> 00:50:29,446
You are right.

359
00:50:30,246 --> 00:50:31,846
I think more highly of you, now.

360
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:39,566
You got into trouble
and risked your lives for me.

361
00:50:40,486 --> 00:50:43,366
I don't want to be a burden for you
any more.

362
00:50:43,486 --> 00:50:44,806
Give me your blessings.

363
00:50:44,886 --> 00:50:45,886
Sugay Hatun.

364
00:50:46,006 --> 00:50:47,166
Where are you going?

365
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:50,446
We can't let her go, Günalp Bey.
What would we say to our bey?

366
00:50:50,566 --> 00:50:51,566
Let's go after her.

367
00:50:51,686 --> 00:50:55,526
Wait. It won't help.

368
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:58,686
Only I can share her feelings with her
right now.

369
00:51:00,126 --> 00:51:02,366
I need to talk to her, woman to woman.

370
00:51:03,246 --> 00:51:04,486
Sugay Hatun...

371
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:05,966
Much appreciated.

372
00:51:13,646 --> 00:51:14,646
Sugay Hatun...

373
00:51:16,126 --> 00:51:17,806
Sugay Hatun, wait.

374
00:51:17,966 --> 00:51:20,646
Don't come after me, Lady Almila. Go back.

375
00:51:22,806 --> 00:51:27,086
We came here to rescue you
from those bastards, we can't leave you.

376
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:31,326
I'm grateful for what you did for me.

377
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:34,486
I only ask you...

378
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:37,566
to give me your blessings. That's all.

379
00:51:41,006 --> 00:51:44,246
I can't go back to the tribe now.

380
00:51:45,446 --> 00:51:46,766
And why is that?

381
00:51:47,046 --> 00:51:51,046
Don't you see? From the moment I came
to the tribe, I got you into trouble.

382
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:55,806
Ertuğrul Bey also had a fight with them
the first time he saw me.

383
00:51:57,606 --> 00:52:02,526
I'll leave in order not to cause more
trouble for the tribe and Ertuğrul Bey.

384
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:04,206
You can't leave, Sugay Hatun.

385
00:52:05,126 --> 00:52:06,926
Why are these guys coming after you?

386
00:52:13,086 --> 00:52:15,486
They hold me responsible
for the death of my child.

387
00:52:18,646 --> 00:52:20,686
Now, let me go.

388
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:22,286
You can't, Sugay Hatun.

389
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,806
Did you ever think about Osman?

390
00:52:28,766 --> 00:52:32,366
Osman is used to your milk.
You eased his pains with your milk.

391
00:52:33,006 --> 00:52:35,966
Now do you think he will accept
some other woman's milk?

392
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:37,886
Do you want to leave him to starve?

393
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:41,126
You know best
how it feels to lose a child.

394
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:47,966
How can you leave a baby
while he is depending on you?

395
00:52:52,046 --> 00:52:54,886
Now, will you leave
and probably cause a baby to die?

396
00:52:55,326 --> 00:52:59,006
Or will you stay and keep on feeding
that beautiful baby?

397
00:53:15,086 --> 00:53:16,726
Osman must be crying right now.

398
00:53:18,926 --> 00:53:20,326
{\an8}I need to feed him.

399
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:09,196
Brother...

400
00:54:10,436 --> 00:54:12,596
Why is this demon...

401
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:15,796
staring at us?

402
00:54:16,956 --> 00:54:18,996
Don't think about him, brother.

403
00:54:25,036 --> 00:54:26,316
Just rest.

404
00:54:30,396 --> 00:54:35,516
Brother, I'd sleep so well...

405
00:54:37,996 --> 00:54:39,756
if I could cut his head off right here.

406
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:10,756
How are you, Alp Commander Bamsi ?

407
00:55:11,436 --> 00:55:12,716
Why are you asking?

408
00:55:13,436 --> 00:55:15,676
Just asking.

409
00:55:21,036 --> 00:55:23,636
You came to the battlefield
roaring like a lion.

410
00:55:25,036 --> 00:55:26,076
You're a brave boy.

411
00:55:28,196 --> 00:55:29,316
So are you, Turgut.

412
00:55:40,716 --> 00:55:42,676
I heard you're migrating soon.

413
00:55:44,996 --> 00:55:51,356
If your Bey sets up his pavilion in Söğüt
as a frontiersman, he won't go away, huh?

414
00:55:51,756 --> 00:55:53,196
Why do you care, Noyan?

415
00:55:55,556 --> 00:55:59,076
Emperor of Nicaea won't give you peace
where you'll migrate.

416
00:56:01,756 --> 00:56:03,836
We'll put him in his place.

417
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:09,756
Let's say you put the Emperor
in his place.

418
00:56:10,996 --> 00:56:13,436
What about Ögedei Khan? Huh?

419
00:56:16,316 --> 00:56:18,996
What will you do
when Ögedei Khan comes here?

420
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:20,916
Huh?

421
00:56:25,436 --> 00:56:26,956
This won't end well for you.

422
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:34,596
The weapons of brave men like you
should not only rule Byzantium,

423
00:56:35,236 --> 00:56:36,836
but also the whole world.

424
00:56:39,116 --> 00:56:40,836
We are the new world order.

425
00:56:45,196 --> 00:56:46,836
Don't you still get that?

426
00:56:48,156 --> 00:56:49,276
Noyan!

427
00:56:51,796 --> 00:56:54,636
Screw you, your Khan...

428
00:56:56,756 --> 00:56:58,876
and your new world order.

429
00:57:02,276 --> 00:57:06,316
Do you think we forgot about you
attacking our tribe and killing many?

430
00:57:08,476 --> 00:57:13,316
And how dare you talk about selling
our weapons to your Khan?

431
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:32,196
My God... Osman is melting away
in front of my own eyes.

432
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,876
My God, don't withhold your mercy.

433
00:57:37,356 --> 00:57:40,756
Take some of my life and give it to him.
My baby.

434
00:57:45,676 --> 00:57:47,316
<i>Can I come in?</i>

435
00:57:48,676 --> 00:57:49,796
Come in.

436
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:56,356
Sugay Hatun!

437
00:57:57,996 --> 00:57:59,996
Mother Hayme! My Osman.

438
00:58:00,116 --> 00:58:02,356
Thank God you got back alive and well.

439
00:58:16,636 --> 00:58:18,356
How are you?

440
00:58:19,156 --> 00:58:20,276
I'm fine, Mother Hayme.

441
00:58:21,396 --> 00:58:22,676
Thank God.

442
00:58:23,556 --> 00:58:27,156
I got away thanks to Almıla Hatun,
Günalp Bey and the Alps.

443
00:58:29,996 --> 00:58:31,516
I feel embarrassed.

444
00:58:34,156 --> 00:58:36,636
I didn't want to come back

445
00:58:36,836 --> 00:58:40,796
to keep Ertuğrul Bey and you away
from the trouble,

446
00:58:41,076 --> 00:58:43,276
but Almıla Hatun convinced me.

447
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:44,956
Why do you say that?

448
00:58:45,996 --> 00:58:48,476
Let all the trouble come at us.

449
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,916
You are a Hatun of our tribe,
you're our daughter.

450
00:58:54,396 --> 00:58:57,076
They'll get what they deserve.

451
00:58:58,036 --> 00:59:01,836
Don't you worry. Feel at ease.

452
00:59:03,076 --> 00:59:04,916
I worried a lot about Osman.

453
00:59:07,316 --> 00:59:11,356
When I heard about Osman being hungry,
I couldn't stay so I came back.

454
00:59:11,796 --> 00:59:13,076
You did the right thing.

455
00:59:14,836 --> 00:59:17,796
Do you know that Osman has been hungry
this whole time?

456
00:59:24,476 --> 00:59:26,676
May God bless you too, Almıla Hatun.

457
00:59:27,716 --> 00:59:29,996
I don't know how we can pay you back.

458
00:59:31,716 --> 00:59:33,316
You're our daughter now.

459
00:59:33,796 --> 00:59:37,276
My pleasure, Hayme Hatun.
Ertuğrul Bey's son is our child as well.

460
00:59:38,836 --> 00:59:41,636
I'm glad to be able to help Osman.

461
00:59:45,276 --> 00:59:46,276
My Osman.

462
00:59:49,476 --> 00:59:52,476
My brave boy. I missed you so much.

463
00:59:53,636 --> 00:59:56,276
Don't worry, I won't leave again.

464
00:59:58,716 --> 00:59:59,996
I won't let you starve.

465
01:00:01,276 --> 01:00:03,556
Mother Hayme, I'll feed Osman now.

466
01:00:04,516 --> 01:00:07,316
Okay. We'll get out
so you can get comfortable.

467
01:00:09,636 --> 01:00:10,636
Come on.

468
01:00:20,636 --> 01:00:23,356
My Osman, my son.

469
01:00:29,156 --> 01:00:30,636
May God bless you.

470
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:33,556
You brought Sugay back alive and well.

471
01:00:34,236 --> 01:00:35,516
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

472
01:00:35,836 --> 01:00:39,516
We'll do anything we can
for the Hatun of our tribe

473
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,596
and the children of our Ertuğrul Bey.

474
01:00:44,316 --> 01:00:48,676
Eynece, Almıla praised
your scouting skills so much.

475
01:00:49,556 --> 01:00:50,556
She was right.

476
01:00:51,676 --> 01:00:52,956
Thank you, Hayme Hatun.

477
01:00:55,476 --> 01:00:56,476
Thanks.

478
01:00:59,516 --> 01:01:01,956
Mother, if you'll excuse me,
I'll see Artuk Bey.

479
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:03,436
Goodbye, son.

480
01:01:15,596 --> 01:01:17,676
Mother Hayme, maybe this is a bad time.

481
01:01:17,956 --> 01:01:20,836
But the people who abducted Sugay Hatun
are not trustworthy.

482
01:01:21,476 --> 01:01:24,116
-Did she tell you something?
-I don't know who they are.

483
01:01:24,836 --> 01:01:28,596
Before, when Ertuğrul ran into her,
they attacked them as well.

484
01:01:30,636 --> 01:01:32,516
Ertuğrul dealt with them.

485
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:37,196
But it's obvious that these people
won't let Sugay Hatun go.

486
01:01:38,076 --> 01:01:40,476
Seems like there's something
she doesn't want to tell us.

487
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:44,796
We have to find out who is after
Sugay Hatun, Mother Hayme.

488
01:01:45,516 --> 01:01:47,956
Or she might get in
a lot of trouble again.

489
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:50,236
You're right.

490
01:01:51,396 --> 01:01:53,196
We have to figure it out right away.

491
01:01:53,956 --> 01:01:58,836
I'll talk to Sugay when the time's right.

492
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:07,396
The past is in the past.

493
01:02:09,076 --> 01:02:10,476
Now it's time to be smart.

494
01:02:13,156 --> 01:02:14,996
Our holy army will be here.

495
01:02:17,996 --> 01:02:19,796
And they'll slaughter your tribes.

496
01:02:22,756 --> 01:02:27,276
Mongolians and Turks are the children
of the same land.

497
01:02:28,796 --> 01:02:33,396
Instead of hurting each other,
we should rule the world together.

498
01:02:42,716 --> 01:02:45,916
I won't die before I make sure
Aykız's spirit rests in peace!

499
01:02:50,036 --> 01:02:54,676
What happened to Aykız was
because of your stubbornness.

500
01:02:57,036 --> 01:03:01,836
If you had joined our reign,
Aykız wouldn't have burnt to her death.

501
01:03:04,596 --> 01:03:06,236
Turgut! Brother!

502
01:03:11,036 --> 01:03:14,636
We'll destroy you, your Khan,
and his dogs, Noyan. You should know that.

503
01:03:18,396 --> 01:03:19,756
Brother, stop.

504
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:38,396
With this attitude,
you'd only drown in your own blood.

505
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,116
Don't listen to this demon's words.

506
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,516
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

507
01:03:57,236 --> 01:03:58,236
Noyan!

508
01:04:07,756 --> 01:04:11,876
Don't worry, Ertuğrul.
Me and your brother Turgut are having fun.

509
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:30,996
Abdur Rahman, get back to your duty.

510
01:04:33,276 --> 01:04:34,556
Your wish is my command.

511
01:04:41,116 --> 01:04:42,396
Alps...

512
01:04:57,756 --> 01:04:59,756
Don't bother my Alps, Noyan.

513
01:05:03,076 --> 01:05:04,756
I don't want anything to happen to you.

514
01:05:21,556 --> 01:05:22,876
It means,

515
01:05:23,796 --> 01:05:25,676
"The sea of mind starts with books...

516
01:05:26,796 --> 01:05:29,956
the sea of water starts
with small brooks."

517
01:05:31,476 --> 01:05:36,436
Getting close to Ögedei Khan
is a big gift to you from the spirits.

518
01:05:41,036 --> 01:05:42,996
Don't underestimate what I just said.

519
01:05:59,796 --> 01:06:01,196
Forgive me, Bey.

520
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:04,036
I couldn't control my anger.

521
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:12,196
Our biggest enemy is not the Mongolians!

522
01:06:15,716 --> 01:06:18,436
But it's the anger
we let grow inside of us, Turgut.

523
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:25,036
If we can't control our anger, we're done.

524
01:06:35,356 --> 01:06:37,316
Now go and get some fresh air.

525
01:06:41,316 --> 01:06:42,596
Okay, Bey.

526
01:06:59,396 --> 01:07:01,996
When I was fighting,
I didn't even realize I got a wound.

527
01:07:09,636 --> 01:07:11,316
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

528
01:07:14,596 --> 01:07:16,716
Your wound is not deep, Günalp Bey.

529
01:07:17,516 --> 01:07:21,356
But we have to be careful.
I'm glad you're here.

530
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:25,956
This ointment will help you recover
quickly, if God permits.

531
01:07:26,716 --> 01:07:27,716
God willing.

532
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:32,396
Almıla Hatun caught up to the fight again.

533
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:36,516
And then she went after Sugay Hatun
and convinced her to come back.

534
01:07:36,596 --> 01:07:38,836
You got suspicious and inspected them.

535
01:07:39,396 --> 01:07:42,396
But the woman proved you wrong
with what she did.

536
01:07:43,236 --> 01:07:44,556
You're right, Artuk Bey.

537
01:07:45,516 --> 01:07:48,716
We considered every possibility
with Ertuğrul Bey's command.

538
01:07:55,996 --> 01:07:58,516
There were some things
that I was suspicious of.

539
01:07:59,556 --> 01:08:01,036
But like you said,

540
01:08:01,636 --> 01:08:04,156
the woman proved me wrong
with what she did.

541
01:08:15,036 --> 01:08:16,636
Still, Ertuğrul Bey is right.

542
01:08:17,116 --> 01:08:19,636
The spies of Noyan loom around
in these lands.

543
01:08:20,876 --> 01:08:22,476
We'll take more precautions.

544
01:08:23,396 --> 01:08:27,396
I'll investigate the tribes and
the merchants. Feel at ease.

545
01:08:34,476 --> 01:08:38,236
Thank you, Artuk Bey.
And thanks for the remedy.

546
01:08:39,836 --> 01:08:42,116
God is the one who gives the remedy,
Günalp Bey.

547
01:08:42,596 --> 01:08:43,596
Thank you.

548
01:08:44,516 --> 01:08:45,516
Thank you.

549
01:08:57,476 --> 01:09:00,116
-Is he asleep?
-He is, Mother Hayme.

550
01:09:06,396 --> 01:09:07,956
He was so hungry.

551
01:09:12,876 --> 01:09:16,036
I'm so sorry I left him to starve.

552
01:09:18,476 --> 01:09:23,756
Thank God you got back alive and well.

553
01:09:25,476 --> 01:09:28,916
You got Osman back and he got you back.

554
01:09:29,476 --> 01:09:30,836
That's what's important.

555
01:09:36,716 --> 01:09:39,996
Sugay, from now on, you're my daughter.

556
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,236
And I'm your mother.

557
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:47,436
Your problems are ours as well.

558
01:09:49,196 --> 01:09:52,356
Let me know if you have one.

559
01:09:53,916 --> 01:09:58,196
Who are these people
who keep bothering you?

560
01:09:59,276 --> 01:10:03,156
Tell me, so we can take precautions.

561
01:10:09,396 --> 01:10:10,876
It's the relatives of my husband.

562
01:10:13,156 --> 01:10:14,876
When my husband died...

563
01:10:17,236 --> 01:10:19,516
they wanted me to get married
to his brother.

564
01:10:21,196 --> 01:10:22,396
I didn't accept.

565
01:10:24,036 --> 01:10:25,436
I ran away with my child.

566
01:10:27,676 --> 01:10:31,516
But when my child died...

567
01:10:35,036 --> 01:10:36,276
I was all alone.

568
01:10:39,076 --> 01:10:41,956
They held me responsible for the death
of my child.

569
01:10:43,596 --> 01:10:44,716
They want revenge.

570
01:10:45,716 --> 01:10:47,596
They won't let me go.

571
01:10:48,956 --> 01:10:55,316
You are from the tribe
of the glorious Ertuğrul Bey.

572
01:10:56,156 --> 01:10:57,796
You're under his protection.

573
01:10:58,636 --> 01:11:02,876
You're the wet nurse
of Ertuğrul Bey's child.

574
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:08,596
No one can attempt to harm you
when you're here.

575
01:11:11,036 --> 01:11:13,356
I don't think they'll stop, Mother Hayme.

576
01:11:15,356 --> 01:11:18,196
They won't let me go
until they get their revenge.

577
01:11:18,676 --> 01:11:20,156
Don't worry.

578
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:24,876
From now on, more Alps will escort you

579
01:11:25,676 --> 01:11:29,116
and no one will get to you.

580
01:11:31,676 --> 01:11:32,676
Do you understand?

581
01:11:33,676 --> 01:11:34,956
God willing, Mother Hayme.

582
01:11:37,196 --> 01:11:38,796
May God bless you.

583
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:44,596
You have become my family
after I lost mine.

584
01:11:45,796 --> 01:11:50,156
From now on, I won't leave you
or Osman.

585
01:11:51,196 --> 01:11:53,436
May God bless you.

586
01:12:17,956 --> 01:12:19,756
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

587
01:12:21,996 --> 01:12:24,716
My God, you are...

588
01:12:25,476 --> 01:12:28,316
You are the best one to keep
what you were entrusted with.

589
01:12:29,716 --> 01:12:31,476
I entrusted my kids to you.

590
01:12:32,996 --> 01:12:34,796
Protect them.

591
01:12:36,196 --> 01:12:37,476
Help them.

592
01:12:38,596 --> 01:12:42,956
Give us strength on our tough mission.

593
01:12:45,316 --> 01:12:49,116
Grant us success on our mission.

594
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:54,156
Help me not let my state down,
and help my state against the enemy.

595
01:12:58,236 --> 01:13:00,036
Help us be victorious, my God.

596
01:13:01,596 --> 01:13:05,716
Help us protect the order that we built
with so much effort and time.

597
01:13:07,996 --> 01:13:11,796
Don't let us submit to
anyone else but you.

598
01:13:25,636 --> 01:13:26,876
Amen.

599
01:15:38,716 --> 01:15:40,796
Look at what God creates.

600
01:15:42,836 --> 01:15:45,076
Look at what God creates.

601
01:15:53,116 --> 01:15:58,716
Look at that vast thing
that they call the sea, brothers.

602
01:16:29,756 --> 01:16:34,116
My God, thank goodness.

603
01:16:34,836 --> 01:16:37,436
Thank you for the beauty.

604
01:16:44,196 --> 01:16:48,156
All these beautiful things were created
by Tengri for my Khan.

605
01:16:55,436 --> 01:16:59,596
From now on, the Black Sea is
my Khan's, just like all the seas.

606
01:17:02,436 --> 01:17:04,156
The water is salty, you can't drink it.

607
01:17:04,356 --> 01:17:06,436
But it helps you to go far away.

608
01:17:09,516 --> 01:17:11,636
Ögedei Khan will send us a ship.

609
01:17:13,316 --> 01:17:15,876
We'll travel the rest of the way by sea.

610
01:17:16,276 --> 01:17:18,356
We'll pass the vicious sea by ship.

611
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:39,436
Abdur Rahman, our wounded Alps should
wait by the horses until we return.

612
01:17:40,076 --> 01:17:41,356
Your wish is my command.

613
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:43,116
Alps...

614
01:18:15,156 --> 01:18:17,076
You're safe now, Ertuğrul.

615
01:18:20,436 --> 01:18:24,516
From now on, there are no Crusaders,
no Governors and no traitor Beys.

616
01:18:25,476 --> 01:18:29,716
You'll be safe in the holy lands
of Ögedei Khan.

617
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,556
Don't be so sure, Noyan.

618
01:18:38,476 --> 01:18:40,916
What do you know and hide from me,
Ertuğrul?

619
01:19:10,356 --> 01:19:14,396
Alps, be very careful from now on.

620
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:17,676
Are you worried about Noyan, my Bey?

621
01:19:19,196 --> 01:19:22,716
I think there are worse people
than Noyan where we are going.

622
01:19:27,036 --> 01:19:32,076
From now on, keep your eyes open
and your weapons ready.

623
01:19:34,156 --> 01:19:35,276
All right, my Bey.

624
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:56,356
The ship is coming!

625
01:20:33,316 --> 01:20:37,556
My child that I had to bury before
I could get enough of your scent.

626
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:41,196
You had such a beautiful face.

627
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:46,756
My only wish from God is
to meet you again there.

628
01:20:49,556 --> 01:20:53,436
Oh, to smell you again, my son.

629
01:20:57,196 --> 01:20:58,756
<i>Can I come in?</i>

630
01:21:04,396 --> 01:21:05,516
Come in.

631
01:21:09,556 --> 01:21:10,556
Gündüz.

632
01:21:14,156 --> 01:21:17,196
Sugay Hatun, why are you crying?

633
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:19,116
What are you holding?

634
01:21:22,436 --> 01:21:24,996
The socks of my child that I lost, Gündüz.

635
01:21:26,236 --> 01:21:27,876
I miss his scent so much.

636
01:21:29,116 --> 01:21:30,116
So...

637
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:35,396
I was inhaling his scent from
his socks to try to ease my pain.

638
01:21:36,236 --> 01:21:38,316
I'm sorry for your loss, Sugay Hatun.

639
01:21:39,156 --> 01:21:44,116
You take care of my brother as your own,
you feed him and nourish him.

640
01:21:44,716 --> 01:21:46,316
He is your child too.

641
01:21:46,556 --> 01:21:48,276
Oh my dear.

642
01:21:51,316 --> 01:21:56,356
Your brothers Osman, Savcı and you
are like my children, Gündüz.

643
01:21:56,796 --> 01:21:59,396
You're my only consolation
in the whole world.

644
01:22:07,116 --> 01:22:09,276
Welcome, Almıla Hatun.

645
01:22:09,636 --> 01:22:11,036
Thank you, Gündüz Alp.

646
01:22:11,956 --> 01:22:14,356
Sugay Hatun, you look tired.

647
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:17,636
Thank God I'm fine, Almıla Hatun.

648
01:22:18,556 --> 01:22:21,716
I got Osman back and fed him.
What else would I want?

649
01:22:22,756 --> 01:22:26,636
Sugay Hatun, how did you
and my father meet?

650
01:22:29,596 --> 01:22:33,996
When I was with my son,
Aktolgali found me first.

651
01:22:34,796 --> 01:22:36,916
After him, Ertuğrul Bey arrived.

652
01:22:37,356 --> 01:22:39,956
So Aktolgali found you, Sugay Hatun?

653
01:22:40,796 --> 01:22:43,156
Aktolgali is very smart.

654
01:22:45,876 --> 01:22:48,996
My horse is very smart too.
Do you like horses a lot?

655
01:22:49,436 --> 01:22:53,316
I love them a lot, Almıla Hatun.
I love Aktolgali the most.

656
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,036
But my father is gone.

657
01:22:56,516 --> 01:22:58,676
No one lets me ride horses anymore.

658
01:23:03,116 --> 01:23:05,036
Come on then. I'll let you ride my horse.

659
01:23:06,236 --> 01:23:08,116
Really, Almıla Hatun?

660
01:23:08,636 --> 01:23:10,596
Really, as long as you want to.

661
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,276
I really want to.

662
01:23:13,676 --> 01:23:16,356
Almıla Hatun, isn't it dangerous?

663
01:23:16,836 --> 01:23:18,156
What if something happens?

664
01:23:18,236 --> 01:23:20,036
Nothing will happen, Sugay Hatun.

665
01:23:20,556 --> 01:23:22,916
I know about horses anyway.

666
01:23:23,316 --> 01:23:24,876
Don't worry, Sugay Hatun.

667
01:23:25,476 --> 01:23:28,316
As long as we are cautious,
nothing bad will happen.

668
01:23:31,876 --> 01:23:34,956
Come on, Gündüz. Go now and
get permission from your grandmother.

669
01:23:35,036 --> 01:23:36,516
So I can let you ride my horse.

670
01:23:36,836 --> 01:23:38,356
Okay, Almıla Hatun.

671
01:24:35,756 --> 01:24:37,716
We've got news from our spy in the palace.

672
01:24:39,356 --> 01:24:41,996
These messengers are taking a very
important letter to the castle.

673
01:24:47,636 --> 01:24:51,316
We'll kill the men and get the letter.

674
01:24:59,036 --> 01:25:00,836
Where did you send the Alps to, Ertuğrul?

675
01:25:01,436 --> 01:25:03,836
I sent them to look around, Noyan.

676
01:25:04,236 --> 01:25:06,236
This is Ögedei Khan's land.

677
01:25:07,036 --> 01:25:10,916
In Ögedei Khan's lands, not even a snake
or a centipede can touch a man.

678
01:25:13,956 --> 01:25:16,956
It could be worse than a snake
or a centipede, Noyan.

679
01:25:18,956 --> 01:25:22,436
Let's just be cautious, that's all.

680
01:25:26,556 --> 01:25:27,796
Eat, you strong boy.

681
01:25:28,716 --> 01:25:30,556
Eat so you can get stronger.

682
01:25:31,956 --> 01:25:36,556
You should eat and get stronger too.

683
01:25:37,396 --> 01:25:41,676
So when we cut you up,
you won't die quickly.

684
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:24,516
Didn't I tell you there'd be worse things
than snakes and centipedes?

685
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:27,756
Don't you know me?

686
01:26:31,516 --> 01:26:33,356
We're going to Ögedei Khan's pavilion.

687
01:26:36,436 --> 01:26:38,436
-Who are you?
-Your killer.

688
01:26:46,116 --> 01:26:47,316
Our killer, huh?

689
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:49,996
Come on and let's see who is dying!

690
01:26:52,116 --> 01:26:53,916
Protect the saddlebag!

691
01:27:24,236 --> 01:27:26,916
We're coming, Bey.

692
01:27:35,356 --> 01:27:36,876
Let's go and end this.

693
01:27:42,956 --> 01:27:44,156
There's a raid!

694
01:27:53,796 --> 01:27:54,796
Attack!

695
01:28:30,076 --> 01:28:31,596
This guy must have the letter.

696
01:29:05,316 --> 01:29:07,316
We'll take advantage of this information.

697
01:29:11,716 --> 01:29:13,916
All the soldiers are dead,
what should we do now?

698
01:29:14,796 --> 01:29:16,236
Take the soldiers' clothes.

699
01:29:16,796 --> 01:29:18,396
And bury their bodies.

700
01:29:23,756 --> 01:29:26,076
We have to take this letter
to Alangoya right away.

701
01:29:26,956 --> 01:29:28,076
Come on!

702
01:31:31,316 --> 01:31:32,556
You were right, Ertuğrul.

703
01:31:37,676 --> 01:31:41,556
Who dares trap me in the land
of Ögedei Khan?

704
01:31:42,756 --> 01:31:44,916
You'll learn about it when you arrive
at the pavilion.

705
01:31:50,796 --> 01:31:52,236
What do you have in your saddlebag?

706
01:31:57,076 --> 01:31:58,476
How do they know about it?

707
01:31:59,756 --> 01:32:00,996
I told you, Noyan...

708
01:32:01,796 --> 01:32:03,716
You'll learn about it when we get there.

709
01:32:12,156 --> 01:32:14,196
Come on, Alps. Let's go.

710
01:32:42,249 --> 01:32:43,449
Sit firmly in the saddle.

711
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:46,769
Hold the reins tight.

712
01:32:48,609 --> 01:32:51,889
The horse belongs to he who rides it,
the sword belongs to he who wields it.

713
01:32:58,489 --> 01:32:59,969
Come on, Gündüz Alp.

714
01:33:38,729 --> 01:33:40,969
Grandmother, look at me riding.

715
01:33:41,409 --> 01:33:43,169
May your grandmother die for you.

716
01:33:58,729 --> 01:33:59,929
Thank you, Almıla, my girl.

717
01:34:00,689 --> 01:34:02,729
Since you arrived,
my Gündüz has grown into himself.

718
01:34:06,489 --> 01:34:07,489
Just look,

719
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,449
how well he rides.

720
01:34:14,169 --> 01:34:15,249
Just like his father.

721
01:34:19,809 --> 01:34:20,849
Yes, Hayme Ana.

722
01:34:21,689 --> 01:34:23,929
It's evident
that he is Ertuğrul Bey's son.

723
01:34:28,689 --> 01:34:29,689
Thank you.

724
01:34:30,249 --> 01:34:32,649
You look after our children so well.

725
01:34:34,209 --> 01:34:36,809
God sent you to us in these hard times.

726
01:34:37,609 --> 01:34:38,489
God willing

727
01:34:39,329 --> 01:34:41,049
you'll have your own children one day.

728
01:34:43,049 --> 01:34:44,049
Amen, Hayme Ana.

729
01:34:45,049 --> 01:34:47,089
I too would like to have a home, children.

730
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:52,369
But how could that happen
when there's so much work to be done.

731
01:34:53,049 --> 01:34:56,169
Surely there's a good match out there,
waiting for you.

732
01:34:58,929 --> 01:35:00,769
Always toiling among men,

733
01:35:03,009 --> 01:35:06,369
fighting amongst them,
I've become like them, Hayme Ana.

734
01:35:06,689 --> 01:35:08,089
What man would ever have me?

735
01:35:08,569 --> 01:35:09,729
Don't say that, child.

736
01:35:10,249 --> 01:35:11,689
You are a valiant woman.

737
01:35:12,489 --> 01:35:13,809
And you are beautiful.

738
01:35:15,769 --> 01:35:18,009
God will give you what is best for you.

739
01:35:19,609 --> 01:35:20,609
Hopefully.

740
01:35:24,689 --> 01:35:26,009
Come here, Gündüz Alp.

741
01:36:01,729 --> 01:36:04,569
Grandmother, did you see?
I rode the horse so well.

742
01:36:05,169 --> 01:36:06,809
I did, my brave boy.

743
01:36:07,409 --> 01:36:08,689
You rode well.

744
01:36:09,769 --> 01:36:12,089
But now, let's go to your brothers

745
01:36:12,329 --> 01:36:13,849
and tend to them a little, eh?

746
01:36:14,449 --> 01:36:16,609
-Okay, Grandmother. Let's go.
-Come on.

747
01:36:17,049 --> 01:36:18,889
You come too, Almıla Hatun.

748
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,049
You go with your grandmother.

749
01:36:21,329 --> 01:36:23,289
I need to do something
and then I'll be there.

750
01:36:23,369 --> 01:36:24,369
Okay.

751
01:36:25,089 --> 01:36:26,169
Come on.

752
01:37:06,289 --> 01:37:09,529
We have entered the layer of
the centipedes, let's hope we can get out.

753
01:37:09,929 --> 01:37:11,049
Let's hope, brother.

754
01:37:12,529 --> 01:37:13,529
Let's...

755
01:38:06,729 --> 01:38:08,249
Tell my khan I have arrived.

756
01:38:09,169 --> 01:38:11,529
Tell him, Sultan Gıyaseddin
sent an emissary.

757
01:38:12,289 --> 01:38:13,289
Ertuğrul Bey.

758
01:38:43,809 --> 01:38:46,529
Will you still not tell me
what happened in the forest?

759
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:51,809
Are you going to ask me
what games are being played

760
01:38:51,889 --> 01:38:54,649
in the lands of your khan,
whom you deem so highly, Noyan?

761
01:38:55,889 --> 01:38:58,049
If you are up to something, Ertuğrul,

762
01:38:59,129 --> 01:39:00,609
you will pay a heavy price.

763
01:39:04,489 --> 01:39:07,649
You being an emissary
is of no concern to my khan Ögedei...

764
01:39:08,689 --> 01:39:09,729
or to me.

765
01:39:12,289 --> 01:39:14,649
Be careful in the presence of my khan.

766
01:39:19,489 --> 01:39:21,009
We have a saying.

767
01:39:25,569 --> 01:39:26,889
Which means

768
01:39:27,369 --> 01:39:28,369
"Think much,

769
01:39:29,049 --> 01:39:30,049
speak little."

770
01:39:32,449 --> 01:39:34,369
If whatever you say
enrages him,

771
01:39:35,089 --> 01:39:36,849
know that you won't leave here alive.

772
01:39:39,129 --> 01:39:41,809
Which would upset me the most.

773
01:39:43,169 --> 01:39:45,569
I wouldn't want to give up
my most valiant enemy.

774
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:51,209
Alps, wait here.

775
01:39:53,889 --> 01:39:55,409
Once we've done our duty

776
01:39:56,209 --> 01:39:57,889
we will go back to our tribe<i>, </i>God willing.

777
01:40:28,769 --> 01:40:30,369
Ögedei Khan awaits you, Noyan.

778
01:42:26,529 --> 01:42:27,729
You shall pass over

779
01:42:28,249 --> 01:42:30,369
the hot iron, Ertuğrul Bey.

780
01:43:10,729 --> 01:43:13,049
Within the man with bad thoughts...

781
01:43:13,569 --> 01:43:14,569
is a big

782
01:43:14,929 --> 01:43:16,009
dark rock.

783
01:43:17,849 --> 01:43:20,329
Within the man with good thoughts...

784
01:43:21,409 --> 01:43:22,409
is the sun,

785
01:43:24,089 --> 01:43:25,169
the moon.

786
01:43:27,929 --> 01:43:29,409
May the hot iron...

787
01:43:30,409 --> 01:43:33,089
drive out the evil spirits within you.

788
01:43:43,569 --> 01:43:44,569
My khan.

789
01:43:46,769 --> 01:43:49,209
Evil spirits have not come with this Turk.

790
01:44:17,689 --> 01:44:19,849
What word, what gifts

791
01:44:20,769 --> 01:44:23,649
has your sultan sent me, Ertuğrul Bey?

792
01:44:26,209 --> 01:44:28,729
The word my sultan has sent
is on the tip of my tongue.

793
01:44:29,729 --> 01:44:31,089
The presents he sent

794
01:44:31,809 --> 01:44:33,889
are inside this sack, Ögedei Khan.

795
01:44:36,409 --> 01:44:40,769
Has your sultan fit the gift he sent
to Ögedei, khan of khans,

796
01:44:42,009 --> 01:44:44,809
into that little sack?

797
01:44:45,889 --> 01:44:47,249
Inside this sack

798
01:44:48,209 --> 01:44:50,409
is the destiny of your khanate,
Ögedei Han.

799
01:45:09,849 --> 01:45:10,849
What news, Mergen?

800
01:45:11,249 --> 01:45:12,649
Have you retrieved the letter?

801
01:45:13,569 --> 01:45:14,689
We have.

802
01:45:15,889 --> 01:45:19,169
It has information concerning
the activities of Mongolian spies

803
01:45:19,889 --> 01:45:20,889
on the beylik frontier.

804
01:45:23,329 --> 01:45:25,449
It contains very important information,
Alangoya.

805
01:45:26,369 --> 01:45:28,689
That letter will go to Günalp Bey.

806
01:45:30,729 --> 01:45:31,729
Günalp Bey?

807
01:45:32,729 --> 01:45:34,409
Why would we do such a thing?

808
01:45:34,489 --> 01:45:36,529
The information in the letter
puts us at risk too.

809
01:45:37,249 --> 01:45:38,449
Oh, Mergen!

810
01:45:39,609 --> 01:45:40,609
You are a hunter,

811
01:45:40,929 --> 01:45:42,889
yet you still don't know how to set bait.

812
01:45:44,689 --> 01:45:48,849
Our men will dress up as Seljuks
and take it to Günalp Bey.

813
01:45:49,809 --> 01:45:52,649
There must be a secret sign
between them and Konya.

814
01:45:53,769 --> 01:45:56,209
Without our men knowing it,

815
01:45:57,009 --> 01:45:59,329
Günalp Bey will understand
that they are Mongols.

816
01:46:01,249 --> 01:46:04,329
And he will follow them
to find the spies' hideout.

817
01:46:05,249 --> 01:46:07,409
And then?

818
01:46:10,009 --> 01:46:12,649
We will direct those three soldiers
to another target.

819
01:46:13,449 --> 01:46:15,209
Günay Bey will fall for the bait.

820
01:46:16,409 --> 01:46:19,249
That way, what we're actually doing
won't be detected.

821
01:46:20,089 --> 01:46:23,289
And Günalp Bey won't be
suspicious of us anymore.

822
01:46:24,769 --> 01:46:26,209
Seal the letter properly.

823
01:46:27,329 --> 01:46:28,929
Send three <i>soldiers </i>to the castle.

824
01:46:31,089 --> 01:46:35,249
Günalp Bey will be lying in wait
like a tiger with sharp teeth.

825
01:46:38,569 --> 01:46:40,489
Set the bait for him at once.

826
01:46:45,089 --> 01:46:48,249
Since when does the fate
of Genghis Khan's khanate

827
01:46:48,329 --> 01:46:50,209
lie in your hands, Ertuğrul Bey?

828
01:46:51,649 --> 01:46:52,649
I know...

829
01:46:53,729 --> 01:46:55,969
that you are a great khan,

830
01:46:56,689 --> 01:46:59,169
loyal to Genghis Khan's laws, Ögedei Khan.

831
01:47:01,409 --> 01:47:03,689
However, instead of improving cities,

832
01:47:04,529 --> 01:47:05,849
you pillage and burn them.

833
01:47:12,129 --> 01:47:16,009
Did you come here to give me advice
as your Sultan Gıyaseddin's envoy

834
01:47:17,209 --> 01:47:19,809
or to pay tribute to me, Ertuğrul Bey?

835
01:47:21,369 --> 01:47:24,409
Tell your sultan to thank God
that I haven't...

836
01:47:26,449 --> 01:47:27,569
burned his cities yet.

837
01:47:29,489 --> 01:47:32,609
We Muslims don't pillage
and burn the cities we conquer.

838
01:47:33,649 --> 01:47:34,689
We improve them.

839
01:47:36,729 --> 01:47:37,729
This makes us

840
01:47:38,089 --> 01:47:39,769
a blessed state.

841
01:47:41,969 --> 01:47:42,969
We know

842
01:47:43,609 --> 01:47:46,769
that a state seeking to plunder
and pillage

843
01:47:47,489 --> 01:47:49,049
won't last.

844
01:47:50,369 --> 01:47:51,369
That state

845
01:47:52,129 --> 01:47:53,129
and its army

846
01:47:53,609 --> 01:47:55,609
is bound to fall, sooner or later.

847
01:48:05,449 --> 01:48:08,769
Do you invite me into your religion,
Ertuğrul Bey?

848
01:48:12,729 --> 01:48:19,369
For thousands of years,
we and the Turks have known...

849
01:48:22,529 --> 01:48:24,449
that Tengri is the one...

850
01:48:25,609 --> 01:48:30,569
and there has been no higher being
than him for all eternity.

851
01:48:33,049 --> 01:48:36,449
Sitting in
my ancestor Genghis Khan's seat...

852
01:48:37,689 --> 01:48:39,809
I am the only representative

853
01:48:40,689 --> 01:48:41,969
of Tengri on earth.

854
01:48:49,969 --> 01:48:51,129
Now tell me.

855
01:48:52,569 --> 01:48:54,049
How can the fate

856
01:48:54,809 --> 01:48:57,049
of my khanate be in that sack?

857
01:49:00,889 --> 01:49:02,849
Your soldiers at our borders

858
01:49:03,609 --> 01:49:06,409
do not obey Genghis Khan's laws.

859
01:49:09,969 --> 01:49:14,169
They disregard the promises
you have given to our sultan.

860
01:49:16,169 --> 01:49:17,169
That is why...

861
01:49:18,289 --> 01:49:20,129
our sultan sent me as an emissary.

862
01:49:21,449 --> 01:49:23,809
He wishes you to put an end to this.

863
01:50:04,049 --> 01:50:05,049
Your bey,

864
01:50:06,289 --> 01:50:08,769
how much loot
does he give you from conquests?

865
01:50:15,409 --> 01:50:16,409
We...

866
01:50:18,009 --> 01:50:19,889
wage holy war for the sake of God.

867
01:50:25,489 --> 01:50:26,929
We are not after plunder.

868
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:43,769
What is there...

869
01:50:45,209 --> 01:50:46,529
to take from...

870
01:50:47,409 --> 01:50:49,009
Anatolia's poor land anyway?

871
01:51:04,809 --> 01:51:07,729
You conquer states and what do you get?

872
01:51:09,089 --> 01:51:12,049
You bring destruction
and fear wherever you go.

873
01:51:13,489 --> 01:51:16,129
Your name will surely be erased
from history.

874
01:51:16,809 --> 01:51:19,329
Our holy cause will prevail.

875
01:51:19,769 --> 01:51:20,969
With God's permission.

876
01:51:31,289 --> 01:51:32,289
Because your bey

877
01:51:33,129 --> 01:51:34,809
can't feed you...

878
01:51:36,449 --> 01:51:38,729
you console yourself with this.

879
01:51:40,409 --> 01:51:41,409
But

880
01:51:41,969 --> 01:51:42,969
don't worry.

881
01:51:43,449 --> 01:51:44,449
Just wait.

882
01:51:44,849 --> 01:51:48,209
Our khan will come to your land too.

883
01:51:49,409 --> 01:51:50,489
If you are smart

884
01:51:50,889 --> 01:51:54,569
you too shall benefit
from the riches he brings.

885
01:51:57,449 --> 01:51:59,969
You'll become proper warriors.

886
01:52:13,769 --> 01:52:14,769
<i>soldiers!</i>

887
01:52:32,609 --> 01:52:34,009
Are you Ertuğrul Bey's alps?

888
01:52:38,409 --> 01:52:39,449
We are, thank God.

889
01:52:43,329 --> 01:52:44,329
Who might you be?

890
01:52:45,089 --> 01:52:46,089
I am Kutlubay.

891
01:52:47,129 --> 01:52:48,449
I am a Turk, like you.

892
01:52:51,569 --> 01:52:54,409
I am one of the commanders
in Ögedei's army.

893
01:52:55,929 --> 01:52:57,889
What business do you have
with the Mongolian army?

894
01:52:58,409 --> 01:52:59,609
Conquering the world,

895
01:53:00,009 --> 01:53:01,489
receiving fame and fortune.

896
01:53:02,129 --> 01:53:04,929
There are many Turks like me
in my khan's army.

897
01:53:07,169 --> 01:53:11,329
All the Turkic alps in the tribes
from Karakorum to Tabriz are joining us.

898
01:53:14,209 --> 01:53:15,329
With God's permission,

899
01:53:15,809 --> 01:53:17,969
Anatolia is still under the rule of
Turkic alps.

900
01:53:18,809 --> 01:53:22,409
They too are more than willing to join
Ögedei Khan's army.

901
01:53:27,409 --> 01:53:30,009
All the alps in Anatolia
will become our <i>soldiers</i>.

902
01:53:31,249 --> 01:53:32,329
Now rest a little.

903
01:53:33,609 --> 01:53:34,889
I will come back to talk.

904
01:54:08,169 --> 01:54:09,609
Permission to enter, my Bey.

905
01:54:09,889 --> 01:54:10,889
Come.

906
01:54:17,889 --> 01:54:20,129
Three messengers have come
from Hüsamettin Karaca, my Bey.

907
01:54:20,409 --> 01:54:21,969
Oh. Bring them in.

908
01:54:25,049 --> 01:54:26,049
Door.

909
01:54:28,649 --> 01:54:29,649
Come.

910
01:54:38,609 --> 01:54:39,729
Welcome, brave men.

911
01:54:40,409 --> 01:54:42,489
What word has Hüsamettin Karaca sent?

912
01:54:43,769 --> 01:54:45,169
It's written in this letter, my bey.

913
01:55:08,489 --> 01:55:14,049
How dare you accuse me of breaking
the laws of my ancestor, Genghis Khan?

914
01:55:17,729 --> 01:55:20,049
True words cut like a sharp knife,
Ögedei Khan.

915
01:55:22,049 --> 01:55:25,729
Our sultan has agreed to
double the tribute you ask for.

916
01:55:28,209 --> 01:55:29,209
However...

917
01:55:30,329 --> 01:55:33,849
while he wishes to renew
the peace agreement that is about expire.

918
01:55:37,049 --> 01:55:38,049
It is...

919
01:55:39,689 --> 01:55:43,449
on the condition that you stop
violating our borders.

920
01:55:46,649 --> 01:55:48,649
How dare you tell me

921
01:55:49,529 --> 01:55:53,049
that my <i>soldiers </i>do not obey me,
Khan of Khans Ögedei Khan...

922
01:55:53,809 --> 01:55:57,329
and break Genghis Khan's laws?

923
01:55:58,089 --> 01:56:01,049
If you can't control
a couple of marauding <i>soldiers</i>

924
01:56:01,929 --> 01:56:03,169
at your borders,

925
01:56:04,289 --> 01:56:07,009
how will you manage to dominate
the whole world, Ögedei Khan?

926
01:56:18,969 --> 01:56:20,369
My <i>soldiers </i>are loyal to me.

927
01:56:21,409 --> 01:56:23,169
You and your sultan lie.

928
01:56:25,369 --> 01:56:27,449
If you can't prove what you say...

929
01:56:28,369 --> 01:56:30,809
your death will come
by my hand, Ertuğrul.

930
01:56:38,849 --> 01:56:39,849
Good.

931
01:56:40,089 --> 01:56:41,289
Good.

932
01:56:44,769 --> 01:56:46,729
Hüsamettin Karaca has written about

933
01:56:46,809 --> 01:56:49,449
Mongolian spy activities in detail.

934
01:56:53,009 --> 01:56:55,569
You came a long way without rest.

935
01:56:56,169 --> 01:56:57,209
You must be tired.

936
01:56:58,009 --> 01:56:59,209
We are, my Bey.

937
01:57:00,089 --> 01:57:01,449
How was the white river water?

938
01:57:04,209 --> 01:57:05,849
We drank plenty. It was good.

939
01:57:11,929 --> 01:57:12,929
It was good, eh?

940
01:57:18,329 --> 01:57:19,329
Good, good.

941
01:57:20,889 --> 01:57:21,889
Commander.

942
01:57:25,889 --> 01:57:26,889
Yes, my Bey.

943
01:57:27,049 --> 01:57:28,249
These brave men are tired.

944
01:57:28,769 --> 01:57:30,049
Let them go and rest.

945
01:57:30,849 --> 01:57:31,849
Give them food.

946
01:57:32,329 --> 01:57:33,329
Yes, my Bey.

947
01:57:33,489 --> 01:57:34,489
This way, Beys.

948
01:57:34,609 --> 01:57:35,609
Thank you, my Bey.

949
01:57:38,209 --> 01:57:39,209
And by the way...

950
01:57:42,209 --> 01:57:43,489
our waters

951
01:57:44,049 --> 01:57:45,529
are not lesser than the white river.

952
01:57:46,489 --> 01:57:47,489
Drink plenty.

953
01:57:47,649 --> 01:57:48,649
Plenty.

954
01:57:50,209 --> 01:57:51,289
Than you, my Bey.

955
01:57:52,129 --> 01:57:53,129
This way, Beys.

956
01:57:59,449 --> 01:58:00,449
Commander.

957
01:58:06,929 --> 01:58:07,929
Yes, my Bey.

958
01:58:09,449 --> 01:58:10,609
Those aren't messengers.

959
01:58:11,249 --> 01:58:12,409
They are Mongolian spies.

960
01:58:14,969 --> 01:58:16,169
How do you know, my Bey?

961
01:58:16,609 --> 01:58:18,209
When I asked about the water

962
01:58:19,369 --> 01:58:21,409
they should have said,
"Sweeter than soil."

963
01:58:22,809 --> 01:58:24,769
That is our signal with Konya.

964
01:58:27,569 --> 01:58:28,649
They didn't know it.

965
01:58:30,249 --> 01:58:32,689
Say the word
and I will put them to the sword, my Bey.

966
01:58:33,129 --> 01:58:34,129
Wait.

967
01:58:35,169 --> 01:58:36,649
We won't do anything to them.

968
01:58:39,009 --> 01:58:41,129
Don't let them know we suspect them.

969
01:58:41,809 --> 01:58:43,009
Let them rest.

970
01:58:44,169 --> 01:58:45,569
We will follow them later.

971
01:58:47,369 --> 01:58:49,849
They will lead us
to the Mongolian spy hideout.

972
01:58:53,169 --> 01:58:54,169
Understood?

973
01:58:55,049 --> 01:58:56,049
Understood, my Bey.

974
01:59:01,809 --> 01:59:02,809
Door.

975
01:59:14,409 --> 01:59:17,929
Noyan himself is witness that
we were ambushed by the evil

976
01:59:18,449 --> 01:59:20,409
that has taken root within your ranks.

977
01:59:24,849 --> 01:59:27,329
When we came close to your encampment

978
01:59:28,489 --> 01:59:30,049
a band of errant soldiers

979
01:59:30,849 --> 01:59:31,969
attacked us.

980
01:59:35,369 --> 01:59:37,329
The soldiers who attacked

981
01:59:38,449 --> 01:59:41,689
knew that the names of the commanders
who do not obey you

982
01:59:41,809 --> 01:59:43,449
were in the sack.

983
01:59:45,369 --> 01:59:47,889
Is it true
that you were attacked on your way, Noyan?

984
01:59:53,609 --> 01:59:54,609
It is, my Khan.

985
02:00:08,289 --> 02:00:09,969
Who are they, Ertuğrul Bey?

986
02:00:10,929 --> 02:00:12,889
Those who wish you'll attack
Seljuk land...

987
02:00:14,689 --> 02:00:17,329
instead of the land over the Danube.

988
02:00:19,809 --> 02:00:20,809
Know that

989
02:00:21,449 --> 02:00:23,169
those who dare to do this today...

990
02:00:24,089 --> 02:00:27,089
will want to take away
your sovereignty tomorrow

991
02:00:27,169 --> 02:00:28,649
when they get the chance.

992
02:00:32,369 --> 02:00:34,329
Who are they, Ertuğrul Bey?

993
02:00:36,169 --> 02:00:38,449
Give me the names in the sack.

994
02:00:42,009 --> 02:00:43,009
<i>My Sultan...</i>

995
02:00:44,169 --> 02:00:45,889
<i>You command me to go to Ögedei</i>

996
02:00:46,329 --> 02:00:50,369
<i>as your envoy, and stop his soldiers</i>
<i>from violating our borders.</i>

997
02:00:51,689 --> 02:00:52,809
<i>Ögedei Khan</i>

998
02:00:52,969 --> 02:00:54,969
<i>abides by Genghis Khan's laws.</i>

999
02:00:55,649 --> 02:00:56,929
<i>He will keep his word.</i>

1000
02:00:57,569 --> 02:01:01,289
{\an8}<i>There must be a reason why his men</i>
<i>won't honor the peace agreement.</i>

1001
02:01:02,209 --> 02:01:05,929
<i>I believe there are commanders</i>
<i>who don't obey Ögedei Khan's orders.</i>

1002
02:01:07,169 --> 02:01:09,769
<i>It does not fall on us</i>
<i>to learn who they are.</i>

1003
02:01:10,049 --> 02:01:12,769
{\an8}<i>However, it is possible</i>
<i>to prove they exist.</i>

1004
02:01:13,929 --> 02:01:16,889
{\an8}<i>Therefore, please spread the word,</i>
<i>in your palace,</i>

1005
02:01:17,329 --> 02:01:19,449
<i>that you know who the commanders are</i>

1006
02:01:19,809 --> 02:01:23,489
<i>that don't obey Ögedei</i>
<i>and violate our borders.</i>

1007
02:01:23,929 --> 02:01:26,409
<i>And that you are to send the names</i>
<i>of these commanders</i>

1008
02:01:26,489 --> 02:01:28,409
<i>to Ögedei with me.</i>

1009
02:01:29,169 --> 02:01:30,449
<i>If I am right,</i>

1010
02:01:30,729 --> 02:01:31,929
<i>these commanders</i>

1011
02:01:32,009 --> 02:01:34,369
<i>will ambush us on the way</i>

1012
02:01:35,009 --> 02:01:36,449
<i>to get the sack with the names.</i>

1013
02:01:39,809 --> 02:01:41,249
If you lie...

1014
02:01:43,329 --> 02:01:44,929
I will first cut out your tongue

1015
02:01:45,329 --> 02:01:47,769
and then I'll cut you into pieces.

1016
02:01:51,889 --> 02:01:53,209
Just like our sultan...

1017
02:01:54,449 --> 02:01:55,809
I also don't know

1018
02:01:56,609 --> 02:02:00,369
who the commanders are that violate
our agreement and assault our land.

1019
02:02:02,329 --> 02:02:03,329
However,

1020
02:02:03,649 --> 02:02:05,209
I was assured today...

1021
02:02:06,209 --> 02:02:07,689
that what I think is right.

1022
02:02:10,049 --> 02:02:12,449
The soldiers that attacked Noyan and me...

1023
02:02:14,249 --> 02:02:18,169
are the dogs of the commanders
that do not obey you.

1024
02:02:22,049 --> 02:02:23,089
Finding out who they are

1025
02:02:24,049 --> 02:02:25,409
is up to you, Ögedei Khan.

1026
02:02:34,729 --> 02:02:36,169
The only thing in the sack...

1027
02:02:40,489 --> 02:02:44,569
is the peace agreement
our sultan sealed with his blood.

1028
02:03:32,049 --> 02:03:33,049
Go.

1029
02:03:34,369 --> 02:03:38,649
Find the bodies of the soldiers
that fell for Ertuğrul Bey's trap.

1030
02:03:39,929 --> 02:03:41,369
Find out who they are.

1031
02:03:42,529 --> 02:03:44,169
As you wish, my Khan.

1032
02:03:57,289 --> 02:03:58,329
I will seal

1033
02:03:59,809 --> 02:04:02,889
this agreement
under the terms your sultan wishes.

1034
02:04:15,609 --> 02:04:17,289
And with my own blood.

1035
02:05:10,009 --> 02:05:12,049
However, Ertuğrul Bey...

1036
02:05:14,969 --> 02:05:17,289
I have a proposition for you.

1037
02:05:34,009 --> 02:05:36,129
Hayme Ana, have you talked to Sugay Hatun?

1038
02:05:37,009 --> 02:05:39,209
Did you find out who was after her?

1039
02:05:40,369 --> 02:05:42,769
We should figure that out
and take precautions.

1040
02:05:43,849 --> 02:05:44,849
We spoke.

1041
02:05:45,849 --> 02:05:48,049
However, she does not want to say much.

1042
02:05:49,049 --> 02:05:51,529
It is clear that this upsets her.

1043
02:05:52,529 --> 02:05:53,849
She does not want to remember.

1044
02:05:54,569 --> 02:05:57,529
She wants to leave it all behind
and start a new life.

1045
02:05:58,369 --> 02:06:00,289
What do you intend to do, Hayme Ana?

1046
02:06:01,769 --> 02:06:03,529
Let some time pass.

1047
02:06:03,889 --> 02:06:05,729
Sugay Hatun is diffident.

1048
02:06:06,449 --> 02:06:08,049
Just let her get used to our tribe.

1049
02:06:08,609 --> 02:06:11,729
She will open up on her own.

1050
02:06:12,089 --> 02:06:13,249
God willing, Hayme Ana.

1051
02:06:13,769 --> 02:06:18,009
It would be good to find out
before Sugay Hatun gets hurt.

1052
02:06:19,049 --> 02:06:20,969
God willing, my girl.

1053
02:06:22,409 --> 02:06:24,649
Is there any word on Ertuğrul Bey,
Hayme Ana?

1054
02:06:25,129 --> 02:06:26,329
I wonder how he is.

1055
02:06:29,329 --> 02:06:30,769
Hopefully nothing is wrong.

1056
02:06:30,889 --> 02:06:32,049
They were both asleep.

1057
02:06:32,969 --> 02:06:34,129
Why would both start crying

1058
02:06:34,969 --> 02:06:36,369
at the same moment?

1059
02:06:39,809 --> 02:06:41,009
Let me go see, my girl.

1060
02:06:41,529 --> 02:06:42,529
I'll come too.

1061
02:06:47,209 --> 02:06:49,729
Sugay, my girl,
why are they both crying at the same time?

1062
02:06:49,849 --> 02:06:51,289
I don't know, Hayme Ana.

1063
02:06:51,889 --> 02:06:53,489
I fed them both.

1064
02:06:54,249 --> 02:06:55,769
They were sound asleep.

1065
02:06:56,289 --> 02:06:58,369
They started crying simultaneously.

1066
02:06:59,249 --> 02:07:00,249
Oh, my brave one.

1067
02:07:03,289 --> 02:07:05,729
Oh, my son. My brave one.

1068
02:07:06,129 --> 02:07:07,169
My dear boy.

1069
02:07:13,529 --> 02:07:14,529
God.

1070
02:07:15,889 --> 02:07:16,889
God.

1071
02:07:18,289 --> 02:07:19,409
Help us.

1072
02:07:22,649 --> 02:07:24,849
For the sake of these children

1073
02:07:25,929 --> 02:07:27,049
may you bring...

1074
02:07:28,329 --> 02:07:31,689
Ertuğrul and his alps
back to the tribe in one piece.

1075
02:07:32,369 --> 02:07:34,249
God, may you protect them.

1076
02:07:34,609 --> 02:07:35,609
Amen.

1077
02:07:37,089 --> 02:07:38,289
Help us, God.

1078
02:07:41,329 --> 02:07:42,329
Oh, my dear.

1079
02:07:42,969 --> 02:07:43,969
Oh, my dear.

1080
02:07:44,209 --> 02:07:45,769
Okay.

1081
02:07:46,489 --> 02:07:47,769
Okay, my brave one.

1082
02:07:53,649 --> 02:07:54,649
Don't cry, my boy.

1083
02:08:20,329 --> 02:08:21,609
Oh, God.

1084
02:08:23,049 --> 02:08:24,169
Oh, the compassionate one.

1085
02:08:25,609 --> 02:08:26,729
Oh, the merciful one.

1086
02:08:27,889 --> 02:08:29,049
Oh, the bright one.

1087
02:08:30,529 --> 02:08:31,609
Oh, God.

1088
02:08:33,129 --> 02:08:34,329
Oh, the compassionate one.

1089
02:08:35,729 --> 02:08:36,849
Oh, the merciful one.

1090
02:08:38,449 --> 02:08:39,609
Oh, the bright one.

1091
02:08:41,289 --> 02:08:42,489
Oh, God.

1092
02:08:43,809 --> 02:08:45,049
Oh, the compassionate one.

1093
02:08:46,089 --> 02:08:47,169
Oh, the merciful one.

1094
02:08:49,409 --> 02:08:50,689
Oh, the bright one.

1095
02:09:01,729 --> 02:09:06,289
Oh, the compassionate and merciful one
whose compassion surrounds all.

1096
02:09:09,729 --> 02:09:13,449
Oh, God whose light
enlightens the whole universe.

1097
02:09:14,849 --> 02:09:19,169
With no doubt, it is your light
that shines in all beings.

1098
02:09:20,849 --> 02:09:21,849
Oh, God...

1099
02:09:22,969 --> 02:09:25,489
you won't leave
those who set out on your path,

1100
02:09:25,969 --> 02:09:27,409
half way.

1101
02:09:28,649 --> 02:09:31,209
Render Ertuğrul Bey
and his alps victorious

1102
02:09:31,369 --> 02:09:33,729
on the journey that they are on.

1103
02:09:35,009 --> 02:09:36,249
Oh God,

1104
02:09:36,609 --> 02:09:39,969
for your follower Abraham,
you were the one who said...

1105
02:09:40,849 --> 02:09:41,929
"Oh, fire...

1106
02:09:43,289 --> 02:09:45,129
be cold and pleasing...

1107
02:09:46,009 --> 02:09:48,529
to Abraham." when he
was thrown into the fire,

1108
02:09:49,049 --> 02:09:50,489
and you protected him.

1109
02:09:52,809 --> 02:09:56,409
You are the one who protected
your beloved Muhammed with a spider web.

1110
02:09:58,929 --> 02:10:02,329
We entrusted to you
those who set out on your path

1111
02:10:04,489 --> 02:10:06,209
May you protect them.

1112
02:10:08,689 --> 02:10:11,649
Surely you are the one who sees
and watches over everything.

1113
02:10:13,209 --> 02:10:14,769
Put those who ambush them...

1114
02:10:15,809 --> 02:10:18,289
and are evil to them, into the ground.

1115
02:10:18,849 --> 02:10:20,009
Render them miserable.

1116
02:10:20,969 --> 02:10:23,409
Oh, the helper of his friends,

1117
02:10:23,889 --> 02:10:25,849
the disturber of his foes.

1118
02:10:28,529 --> 02:10:31,649
We take shelter in you, we seek your aid.

1119
02:10:33,209 --> 02:10:34,209
Assist them.

1120
02:10:35,329 --> 02:10:36,329
Assist them.

1121
02:10:37,729 --> 02:10:38,729
Assist them.

1122
02:10:57,249 --> 02:11:00,449
I am responsible for all the Turks
in Ögedei Khan's army.

1123
02:11:01,049 --> 02:11:03,089
I know who is who, what is what.

1124
02:11:06,049 --> 02:11:07,169
The Seljuks are done for.

1125
02:11:08,249 --> 02:11:11,089
The Anatolian beyliks are in a bad place,
the alps have had it.

1126
02:11:13,489 --> 02:11:14,649
They will come join

1127
02:11:15,449 --> 02:11:16,929
Ögedei Khan's army

1128
02:11:17,369 --> 02:11:19,929
to conquer the world and gain riches.

1129
02:11:24,649 --> 02:11:26,169
What else would they do?

1130
02:11:26,569 --> 02:11:27,609
Who wouldn't want to come?

1131
02:11:30,009 --> 02:11:31,489
Don't be too sure of that.

1132
02:11:34,769 --> 02:11:35,809
In Anatolia

1133
02:11:36,769 --> 02:11:37,929
there are still brave men

1134
02:11:38,289 --> 02:11:41,089
that won't resort to pillage
and plunder, thank God.

1135
02:11:43,769 --> 02:11:46,489
If there's someone we want in our army

1136
02:11:47,369 --> 02:11:49,169
we will surely get him.

1137
02:11:53,009 --> 02:11:55,529
How would you get someone
that doesn't want to come?

1138
02:11:56,009 --> 02:11:58,209
We'll get in his brain, so he will

1139
02:11:58,929 --> 02:12:01,289
lose himself, forget his past.

1140
02:12:01,889 --> 02:12:04,969
He will submit his body and soul to us.

1141
02:12:10,089 --> 02:12:11,289
And whatever we say

1142
02:12:12,089 --> 02:12:13,609
he'll do...

1143
02:12:14,209 --> 02:12:15,209
without question.

1144
02:12:46,009 --> 02:12:47,129
Why did you do this, Turgut?

1145
02:12:48,329 --> 02:12:50,129
So, you made him into a puppet.

1146
02:12:52,049 --> 02:12:53,649
You are valiant alps.

1147
02:12:54,609 --> 02:12:57,049
We might want you in our army.

1148
02:13:03,769 --> 02:13:05,289
May Tengri help you.

1149
02:13:15,089 --> 02:13:16,089
Brother...

1150
02:13:17,049 --> 02:13:19,169
this guy might play us somehow.

1151
02:13:19,729 --> 02:13:21,649
They can make us into puppets
with torture.

1152
02:13:22,729 --> 02:13:24,889
He's responsible for the Turks
in the Mongolian army.

1153
02:13:27,009 --> 02:13:28,009
It's clear...

1154
02:13:29,369 --> 02:13:33,209
that he sends spies into Anatolia
and brainwashes the Turks there.

1155
02:13:35,689 --> 02:13:38,769
Brother, Ertuğrul Bey must know of this.

1156
02:13:39,009 --> 02:13:40,409
We'll need it when we get back.

1157
02:13:42,249 --> 02:13:43,649
If we get back.

1158
02:13:48,369 --> 02:13:49,769
We need to get out of here...

1159
02:13:51,049 --> 02:13:52,689
before they get to us, Bamsı.

1160
02:13:54,609 --> 02:13:55,809
We need to go.

1161
02:14:04,180 --> 02:14:07,020
Mark my words, Ertuğrul Bey.

1162
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:10,100
Genghis Khan says,

1163
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:17,620
"You should tie an animal from its legs
before you eat it.

1164
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:22,500
You should cut open its stomach.

1165
02:14:25,060 --> 02:14:27,540
You should kill it...

1166
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:30,700
by squeezing its heart.

1167
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:39,180
You should squeeze it...

1168
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:45,460
so that it'll get
to the world of spirits...

1169
02:14:46,660 --> 02:14:49,500
by comprehending the power of death."

1170
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:01,900
The Seljuk State is an animal...

1171
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:05,740
tied from its legs...

1172
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:09,780
that fell into my trap.

1173
02:15:13,460 --> 02:15:14,700
I cut its stomach open...

1174
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:17,820
with my sieges

1175
02:15:18,980 --> 02:15:21,740
and the taxes that I ordered.

1176
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:24,460
And now...

1177
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:30,660
I'll come to your land with my sword
that makes the world bow down...

1178
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:38,380
and I'll squeeze Sultan Gıyaseddin's heart
with my majestic hands.

1179
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:46,020
However.

1180
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:49,820
With the decision you'll make...

1181
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:55,220
Sultan Gıyaseddin will lose
and you'll win.

1182
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:01,580
Ertuğrul Bey.

1183
02:16:02,780 --> 02:16:03,780
Now,

1184
02:16:04,540 --> 02:16:05,860
in my holy pavilion...

1185
02:16:07,060 --> 02:16:10,340
I'm asking you to join me.

1186
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:18,420
I am the Khan of all Khans,

1187
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:21,300
Ögedei.

1188
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:30,580
I only ask once
to those brave men that I trust.

1189
02:16:39,660 --> 02:16:40,740
Your words are...

1190
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:43,860
such an honor for a frontiersman like me

1191
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:48,420
who wants to find a home for his tribe...

1192
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:50,820
and settle down.

1193
02:16:54,860 --> 02:16:55,860
First of all,

1194
02:16:56,460 --> 02:16:59,260
I'd like to tell you that I'm honored
by your offer.

1195
02:17:05,140 --> 02:17:06,460
I accept to be

1196
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:12,620
under the command of the biggest
Khan the world has ever seen,

1197
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:15,060
the Khan of...

1198
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:21,500
all Khans.

1199
02:17:30,140 --> 02:17:31,940
It's an honor for me

1200
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:36,460
to revive and manage Anatolia...

1201
02:17:38,060 --> 02:17:40,940
by following your holy mission.

1202
