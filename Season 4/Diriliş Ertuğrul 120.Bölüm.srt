1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Episode 120 will start after 12:10 min.

2
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:35,931
So three people who were disguised
as messengers were Mongolian spies.

3
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,971
So they spread out enough

4
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:43,891
to get the secret letter as messengers
and get to the castle, huh?

5
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:46,251
Not only here, Artuk Bey.

6
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:50,531
These Mongolians have infiltrated
the state.

7
00:12:51,531 --> 00:12:52,891
You're right, Günalp Bey.

8
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,171
All right.

9
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:57,451
So, will you interrogate these three
degenerates and make them speak?

10
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,851
They have to get out of the castle alive.

11
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:06,651
They should so they can take us
to the real swamp.

12
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:11,371
Only then we can reveal all
of their plans.

13
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:13,211
That's right.

14
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:15,531
I'll send Dumrul with you then.

15
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:17,571
He should go with you.

16
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:22,651
We have to let our Sultan know as well.

17
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,771
I took care of that, Artuk Bey.

18
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:27,731
I sent a letter to our Sultan,
explaining the situation.

19
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,891
He'll take more precautions
all over the state, if God permits.

20
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:33,891
Thank you.

21
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:35,691
Günalp Bey,

22
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:37,331
the person who arranged

23
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:40,251
all of this is no one
but the demon Noyan.

24
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:43,891
When Mongolians are hellbent,

25
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:49,011
it wasn't wise for Ertuğrul Bey to go
with him to see Ögedei Khan.

26
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:52,731
We should take care of
the degenerates here.

27
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,611
Ertuğrul Bey will get back alive and well

28
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,651
when he finishes his duty.

29
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,291
God willing.

30
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,331
I'm the frontiersman of the Seljuks.

31
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:19,611
In the west, there are many Turkish tribes
under my command.

32
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:25,731
However, I'd like to know
why you're offering this to me.

33
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:35,251
Ertuğrul Bey.

34
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:39,011
You should know
that dealing with your Sultan

35
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:42,211
while I'm taking over the world
is a waste of time.

36
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:49,291
I strive for world dominance, following
the path of my father Genghis Khan.

37
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,051
You know that no obstacle will stop me.

38
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,411
What about the world of Islam?

39
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:00,411
The world of Islam...

40
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,731
is not a threat to me.

41
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:10,171
It's never been.

42
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,211
As long as your Khalifa,

43
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:19,491
and the Sultans of the Islamic states
are under my command,

44
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:22,171
and pay their taxes,

45
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:26,611
they will be free to practice
their religion and traditions.

46
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,971
I know how strong your faith is.

47
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:42,171
I hope the answer to your question
has satisfied you.

48
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:47,371
Islam is not an enemy for me.

49
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:52,091
On the contrary,
it's a religion that I respect.

50
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:56,571
However, Sultan Gıyaseddin...

51
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,531
didn't give up

52
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:05,171
because of his greed for power,
even though I raised the taxes.

53
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,611
I think there should be a price

54
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:11,851
for the blood that's shed
in such a tough battle.

55
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,971
Of course, you'll get a reward...

56
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:39,091
in exchange for your service,
Ertuğrul Bey.

57
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:45,611
When you're under my command...

58
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:52,131
I'll make you the Sultan
of the Seljuk State.

59
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:12,891
Brother, I want our Bey to get out
as soon as possible.

60
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:15,971
If we stay here any longer, I'll go in.

61
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:21,451
Welcome, brothers.

62
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,851
Lamb stew with goat milk.

63
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:29,211
One of the best Turkish dishes.

64
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:30,851
You must have missed it. Eat it.

65
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:39,491
Are you a Turk too?

66
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,651
I'm a Turk too, brother.

67
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:50,771
And you joined them for fame and glory?

68
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:54,651
No, brother.

69
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:57,331
In the past...

70
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,411
we fell for their trap.

71
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:04,091
I and my tribe went through
a big disaster.

72
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,451
After that, I joined Ögedei Khan's army.

73
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:13,011
Was it Kutlubay who trapped you?

74
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:14,691
Not Kutlubay, brother.

75
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,451
Noyan.

76
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:26,011
What kind of a trap was it?

77
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:28,451
Noyan has a sister.

78
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:30,171
Alangoya.

79
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:36,371
She and her men infiltrated my village
as leather merchants.

80
00:18:40,331 --> 00:18:42,331
And then, they caused a disaster.

81
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:46,131
Leather merchant?

82
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:49,011
Leather merchant.

83
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:52,611
Who else was with Alangoya?

84
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:55,891
She had her sibling too.

85
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:59,571
He's a very good hunter.
That's what she told me.

86
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:04,411
There were others as well,
but we don't know them.

87
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:09,731
A leather merchant woman.

88
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:12,811
And her brother is a good hunter.

89
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:21,851
That's Almıla.

90
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:23,851
Almıla.

91
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:36,611
Almıla.

92
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:44,011
I'm very pleased to have the honor
of meeting

93
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:47,251
the Khan of all Khans,
Ögedei Khan.

94
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:54,691
Did you come to that decision
because of the axe in my hand...

95
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,971
or is it because now
you can see the truth, Ertuğrul?

96
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:06,691
I want to be sure of that, Ertuğrul Bey.

97
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:12,611
I'd known for a long time
that I'd receive this offer.

98
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:28,611
Yeah?

99
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:31,171
How?

100
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:34,451
All through the journey...

101
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:40,691
Noyan tried to convince me
with his words.

102
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:50,851
And his efforts worked.

103
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:53,771
My decision is certain.

104
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:57,371
I'd like to be under your command.

105
00:21:03,891 --> 00:21:08,651
I'll start by sending
the peace treaty right away

106
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:12,091
to my Sultan through my Alps

107
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:15,331
and build my reputation even stronger.

108
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:18,851
Well thought.

109
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:24,011
My Khan, I'd like to tell you something
if you'll let me.

110
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:30,371
What about Oghuz Beys?

111
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:34,731
What will happen if you can't convince
the Sultan, Ertuğrul?

112
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:37,051
Then...

113
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:41,411
the blood that will be shed...

114
00:21:45,611 --> 00:21:47,091
for the Khan of all Khans,

115
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:49,451
Ögedei Khan, won't be in vain.

116
00:21:57,171 --> 00:22:02,891
My only wish is for you not to harm
Muslims and non-Muslims.

117
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:14,571
Ertuğrul Bey.

118
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,491
The rule of Genghis Khan says,

119
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:21,971
"Legal experts,

120
00:22:23,331 --> 00:22:24,331
doctors,

121
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:26,051
scholars,

122
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:29,891
people who dedicated themselves
to worship and chairmanship,

123
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:34,651
muezzins and the people who wash
the deceased shall not pay tax.

124
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:39,211
And they don't have to work.

125
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:41,531
And of course...

126
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:44,251
the ones who obey me...

127
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:46,651
and pay their taxes as well."

128
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:54,051
For me, the rules of my father
is superior to anything else.

129
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:57,651
Be at ease, Ertuğrul Bey.

130
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,651
When we followed the bandit that
raided the leather men caravansary...

131
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,171
Almıla Hatun and her men
had slaughtered the bandits already.

132
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:38,651
Ertuğrul Bey was the first person
who found this very bizarre.

133
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:41,531
But none of us thought of it before.

134
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:47,411
That woman is Noyan's sister.
She slithered in slowly like a snake.

135
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:51,571
I wonder what's happening in the village.

136
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:54,131
Would that woman do something bad?

137
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:56,931
Oh brother, she must have.

138
00:23:57,051 --> 00:24:00,131
She must have done something,
taking advantage of our absence.

139
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:01,731
And we're still here.

140
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:04,131
When will this Ögedei stop talking?

141
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,811
Just wait, brother.

142
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:08,411
Just wait.

143
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:12,331
We've got no other choice
than waiting for our Bey.

144
00:24:13,691 --> 00:24:14,891
Let's pray that...

145
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,491
nothing happens to our tribe
until we get back.

146
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,451
Do you have something to say, Noyan?

147
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:43,811
After all, you and Ertuğrul will take over

148
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:50,491
Seljuk, Nicaea
and Constantinople.

149
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:56,131
Yes, my Khan.

150
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:01,731
We need more to believe...

151
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:04,611
his word, my Khan.

152
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:12,971
You said Ertuğrul Bey
would keep his promise.

153
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:15,731
I haven't heard that he won't.

154
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:18,091
However...

155
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:24,851
he is very good at bending the truth
according to his own needs...

156
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:30,051
make a sword out of it
and stab the enemy with that.

157
00:25:36,211 --> 00:25:37,451
That's why he should...

158
00:25:38,891 --> 00:25:40,211
give us one of...

159
00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:43,131
his sons as a hostage.

160
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:52,531
So if he breaks his promise,

161
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:56,451
he can pay for it with his son's life.

162
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,291
So wherever he goes...

163
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:14,371
he won't be able to escape
your wrath first, and then mine.

164
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:22,891
If you obey me,
you'll let me raise your son

165
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:25,091
as a brave Mongolian commander.

166
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:57,131
I got this tug with gold trimming
to symbolize my reign over Anatolia.

167
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:04,851
The agreement between us becomes valid
when you bring your son to us.

168
00:27:08,571 --> 00:27:11,651
And I'll give this rug to you
when you open the doors

169
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:14,051
of Anatolia for me.

170
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:23,571
And you'll be the Sultan of Anatolia.

171
00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:28,491
To make the agreement...

172
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,571
permanent...

173
00:27:35,811 --> 00:27:38,411
I'll bring you my son personally.

174
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:47,491
I'll keep my promise and keep the peace
with your Sultan for two years.

175
00:27:50,691 --> 00:27:56,131
During that time, I'll prepare my armies
to invade Anatolia.

176
00:27:58,731 --> 00:28:02,051
The rest is up
to yours and Noyan's skills.

177
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:10,571
Either you'll take over the state
without spilling any blood,

178
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:15,851
or I will destroy everything and everyone.

179
00:28:17,171 --> 00:28:18,851
I'll burn everything down.

180
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:20,331
-Alangoya.
-Tell me. What did you learn?

181
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:24,771
Günalp Bey hold
the men you sent as messengers hostages.

182
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,251
Günalp Bey is a smart man.

183
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:37,811
He must have identified them already.

184
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:44,531
And now he'll track them
just like hungry wolves

185
00:29:44,971 --> 00:29:46,531
that can smell flesh.

186
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:52,051
He'll see the men that we sent
when he arrives there.

187
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:57,171
He'll believe that those are
the Mongolians who infiltrated.

188
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:04,411
It'll remove all the suspicions
that they have about us.

189
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:06,371
So,

190
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:09,331
you'll settle in Ertuğrul's village.

191
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:13,091
When the time comes,

192
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:17,411
their state and their pavilion
will crumble open them.

193
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:19,411
I'm sad about one thing.

194
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:24,531
That we couldn't cut Günalp's head off
with our own hands.

195
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:29,531
There will be a time for that, Mergen.

196
00:30:29,851 --> 00:30:30,771
Just be patient.

197
00:30:32,091 --> 00:30:34,331
Now what's important is
to gain their trust,

198
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:36,691
not cutting off their heads.

199
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:57,211
{\an8}Your wish is my command.

200
00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:20,611
This gold will be given
to your families.

201
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:27,491
They'll learn that
you are great Mongolian warriors.

202
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:30,811
Your souls will always be blessed.

203
00:31:31,531 --> 00:31:33,971
{\an8}Long life, sir!

204
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:52,691
May your blood not spill one drop
before you take their lives.

205
00:31:55,171 --> 00:31:58,211
May the fire in your souls
make the demon jealous!

206
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,651
All of them should go to hell!

207
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:05,131
Alangoya, Alangoya!

208
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:09,491
Now go and haunt them.

209
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:30,971
Cover up all your tracks.

210
00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:37,171
Now I'll go and see Artuk Bey.

211
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:40,571
After all, we'll expand the commerce.

212
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:45,211
He needs to support me
for the caravansary.

213
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:49,211
And I'll see Mother Hayme after that.

214
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:51,411
I miss her so much.

215
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,651
I'll destroy them.

216
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:54,091
Thank God who gathered us here...

217
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:59,331
by the green mountain

218
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:02,371
and the water that flows by so strongly.

219
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:05,731
-May God always keep us together.
-Amen.

220
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,931
In the verses our brother read,

221
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,971
our God orders unity

222
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,971
and says,

223
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:19,371
"Grab onto the rope of God altogether.

224
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:21,811
Don't split up.

225
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:27,051
Think of God's blessings.

226
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,131
You guys were enemies...

227
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,691
and he joined your hearts together.

228
00:35:36,131 --> 00:35:40,291
And you became brothers
with his blessing.

229
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:43,931
Once again...

230
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:47,811
you were on the edge of falling...

231
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,851
into a fire pit and he saved you.

232
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:55,611
So God informs you on his verses
so clearly that

233
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:58,371
you find the right path.

234
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:01,971
Maintain a community

235
00:36:03,131 --> 00:36:07,251
that orders goodness
and bans evil.

236
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:11,491
Those are the ones who reach salvation.

237
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:19,491
Don't be like those who split up

238
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,571
after they receive clear proofs.

239
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:27,851
Those are the ones who will suffer."

240
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:33,291
My brothers.

241
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:36,331
God's rope that
we're ordered to grab onto is

242
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:42,451
God's religion holy Islam and
the traditions of our Prophet.

243
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:47,131
Our Prophet advised his community unity

244
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:52,491
and said there's suffering in separation.

245
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:57,691
There are things
that we absolutely can learn from.

246
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:02,531
There are no communities in history

247
00:37:03,411 --> 00:37:06,451
that could be successful
without including everyone.

248
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:12,131
When our Prophet started his journey,
he was all alone.

249
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:16,931
But he was protected by God.

250
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:21,291
First his kith and kin gathered
around him.

251
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:27,091
Later on, smaller communities joined
his sacred mission.

252
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:33,251
The circle expanded day by day.

253
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:36,811
The people in our Prophet's circle

254
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:40,051
clung to him.

255
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:44,691
Even though the heathens tortured them,

256
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:49,691
they got closer with every torture
they had to suffer through.

257
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:52,011
They survived many hardships

258
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:54,491
and they were tested many times.

259
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:58,731
The heathens tried everything
to discourage them.

260
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:02,971
They were forced to leave their home.

261
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:05,971
They were refugees in Medina.

262
00:38:07,091 --> 00:38:10,091
But like always, God didn't abandon

263
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:13,731
that community
who took shelter in him.

264
00:38:14,651 --> 00:38:18,811
Ensar from Medina who embraced them
with great sacrifices

265
00:38:19,051 --> 00:38:20,251
joined this circle.

266
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:23,051
They got even closer.

267
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:27,931
They became the biggest representatives
of Muslim fellowship.

268
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,131
Finally with patience,

269
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:32,731
unity, brotherhood

270
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:35,531
and sacrifices...

271
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:39,691
they got into Mecca
where they were forced to go...

272
00:38:41,131 --> 00:38:43,931
and they were victorious.

273
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:48,771
And in short time, the communities
in the land they were in...

274
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:51,891
joined their community.

275
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,371
What made this community
come together and succeed?

276
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:07,651
It was them hanging onto God's rope.

277
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:14,371
It was their dedication
to our Prophet's mission

278
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:15,851
with a firm determination.

279
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:18,611
It was their brotherhood.

280
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:20,291
It was their unity.

281
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:26,091
It was their selflessness...

282
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:31,331
and their desire to reach for God.

283
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:36,931
In Hucurat Surah, our God commands,

284
00:39:39,051 --> 00:39:41,331
"Believers can only be
brothers and sisters.

285
00:39:43,371 --> 00:39:45,811
So make peace with
your brothers and sisters.

286
00:39:48,171 --> 00:39:51,491
And be afraid of God
so you can reach God's mercy."

287
00:39:53,331 --> 00:39:54,331
My brothers.

288
00:39:56,611 --> 00:40:00,331
We are like the organs of a body.

289
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:03,811
If an organ is dysfunctional,

290
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:06,931
our whole body would be dysfunctional,

291
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:12,651
so we can't be indifferent to a problem
or an issue of our Muslim brother.

292
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:19,811
We're like links of a chain.

293
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:22,971
If one of the links breaks off,

294
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,331
the whole chain would fall apart.

295
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,251
God forbid, all of us would perish.

296
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,491
So we must unite...

297
00:40:36,371 --> 00:40:39,331
and hang onto God's rope tightly.

298
00:40:55,611 --> 00:40:58,651
I'll join the hunting festival
and enjoy my victory.

299
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,411
I trust you both.

300
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,771
Your Alps should take this peace letter
to your Sultan.

301
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,051
You and Noyan should sit down
and talk about

302
00:41:11,091 --> 00:41:12,411
what you're going to do.

303
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:16,531
I'll listen to you when I get back.

304
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:29,331
The door.

305
00:42:02,611 --> 00:42:03,971
What are they guilty of, Noyan?

306
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:08,731
What did they do to get executed
in Ögedei Khan's pavilion?

307
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:12,051
Breaking their promise

308
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:13,931
and disobeying.

309
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:18,731
That's the strictest rule of Genghis Khan.

310
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:22,531
Whoever breaks his promise

311
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:24,611
and disobeys,

312
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:27,491
get executed right away.

313
00:43:49,051 --> 00:43:50,971
You always surprise me, Ertuğrul.

314
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:55,611
You're selling out your state
that you've fought for your whole life

315
00:43:56,251 --> 00:43:57,811
for so long, to become the Sultan.

316
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:20,691
Turgut.

317
00:44:22,771 --> 00:44:25,611
Ögedei Khan sealed the peace treaty

318
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:28,731
that our Sultan asked for
with his own blood.

319
00:44:31,371 --> 00:44:32,411
It's in the saddlebag.

320
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:38,451
Head out with the Alps right now

321
00:44:39,171 --> 00:44:41,771
and take the treaty
to our Sultan in Konya.

322
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:49,331
Your wish is my command
but won't you come with us?

323
00:44:54,411 --> 00:44:58,731
I will stay in Ögedei Khan's pavilion
in honor of the peace treaty,

324
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:00,771
we'll hunt and chat.

325
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:04,931
I'll arrive in the village after you do.

326
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:07,651
Head out right away.

327
00:45:15,131 --> 00:45:16,451
Your wish is my command.

328
00:45:20,571 --> 00:45:21,611
Godspeed.

329
00:45:26,211 --> 00:45:27,451
Your Bey is safe.

330
00:45:28,811 --> 00:45:32,211
I want you to leave our land safely
as well.

331
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:37,451
Ulcay.

332
00:45:39,371 --> 00:45:43,211
Escort Turgut Alp and Bamsi Alp Commander
until they leave our land.

333
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:44,931
Yes, Noyan.

334
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:47,051
Let's go.

335
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:11,171
You didn't talk to your Alps about the
peace treaty you signed with Ögedei Khan.

336
00:46:12,491 --> 00:46:14,611
The pain you caused to our village
is still fresh.

337
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:18,051
When the time comes,
they'll learn about it.

338
00:46:19,851 --> 00:46:22,931
Will you kill them if they disobey you?

339
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:27,291
I entrusted my son's life to Ögedei Khan.

340
00:46:29,171 --> 00:46:30,171
For this,

341
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:33,011
I'm not afraid to take the lives
of my brothers.

342
00:46:34,371 --> 00:46:35,531
Good idea, Ertuğrul.

343
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:38,091
Soldiers.

344
00:46:40,491 --> 00:46:42,411
Escort Ertuğrul to his tent.

345
00:46:44,371 --> 00:46:47,091
We've got important stuff to talk about
in the evening.

346
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:32,731
Why didn't we talk
to our Bey about Almıla?

347
00:47:33,171 --> 00:47:35,651
Tell him that Almıla was the snake
that we nursed in our bosom.

348
00:47:38,211 --> 00:47:40,291
How would we do that
when Noyan was there?

349
00:47:41,011 --> 00:47:42,051
What will we do?

350
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:43,691
Won't we tell him?

351
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:45,331
Just be patient.

352
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:49,051
-Of course we will.
-Brother, we're about to leave.

353
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:50,891
How will we tell him?

354
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:54,971
Just get on your horse.

355
00:47:55,411 --> 00:47:56,411
I'll tell you.

356
00:47:57,131 --> 00:47:58,411
Come on.

357
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:02,611
Fine.

358
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:26,691
-Giddy up!
-Come on!

359
00:48:31,051 --> 00:48:32,051
Giddy up!

360
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:52,611
Ertuğrul Bey.

361
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:54,171
You should know

362
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:59,211
that dealing with your Sultan while I'm
taking over the world is a waste of time.

363
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:05,091
I strive for world dominance, following
the path of my father Genghis Khan.

364
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:08,411
You know that no obstacle will stop me.

365
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:13,971
My God...

366
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:17,251
I fell into a dead well.

367
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,251
Save me out of that well...

368
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:25,291
like you saved the Prophet Joseph,
my God.

369
00:49:41,197 --> 00:49:46,877
Saltuk! Gündüz!
Saltuk! Gündüz!

370
00:50:55,163 --> 00:50:56,523
Almıla Hatun.

371
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:57,843
Gündüz Alp.

372
00:50:59,363 --> 00:51:02,763
It's obvious that you'll be
a capable bey just like your father.

373
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:04,603
You surpassed your brother so quickly.

374
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:06,683
For sure, Almıla Hatun.

375
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:09,443
I'm learning to swing a sword
like my father.

376
00:51:09,963 --> 00:51:12,203
When will you take me for a horse ride?

377
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,203
I made you a promise.

378
00:51:14,483 --> 00:51:17,243
But now, I have some matters
to discuss with Artuk Bey.

379
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:22,483
I will take you for a ride soon
after I'm done here. Okay?

380
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:24,083
Okay, Almıla Hatun.

381
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,883
Then, excuse me, Gündüz Alp.

382
00:51:31,443 --> 00:51:34,283
Come on, alps! It's time to fight.

383
00:51:48,763 --> 00:51:49,763
Dear God.

384
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:04,523
<i>May I come in?</i>

385
00:52:06,563 --> 00:52:07,923
Come in, Almıla Hatun.

386
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:15,083
Welcome.

387
00:52:15,443 --> 00:52:16,563
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

388
00:52:16,963 --> 00:52:19,523
I have something to discuss with you.

389
00:52:20,803 --> 00:52:21,883
Sure, what is it?

390
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:27,203
I'd like to send my men to sell goods
in the Greek villages nearby and around.

391
00:52:27,963 --> 00:52:30,483
Eynece and Karamis will be with them.

392
00:52:31,203 --> 00:52:33,723
But you know, there are some bandits
located around.

393
00:52:34,363 --> 00:52:36,283
We don't want our goods to be harmed.

394
00:52:37,443 --> 00:52:40,883
I'm here to ask you for a few alps
to accompany my men.

395
00:52:41,483 --> 00:52:44,723
Almıla Hatun, we'll guarantee the safety.

396
00:52:45,483 --> 00:52:46,723
Don't worry.

397
00:52:47,683 --> 00:52:49,923
I'll tell the alps to accompany your guys.

398
00:52:50,683 --> 00:52:52,963
You can safely conduct business.

399
00:52:55,203 --> 00:52:58,403
Thank you, Artuk Bey.
That's a huge relief.

400
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,443
It's our duty to provide the security
on these lands, Almıla Hatun.

401
00:53:04,323 --> 00:53:05,963
We will do our best

402
00:53:06,043 --> 00:53:09,723
so that you can conduct your business
safe and sound.

403
00:53:10,323 --> 00:53:11,403
Don't worry.

404
00:53:11,883 --> 00:53:13,483
May God bless you.

405
00:53:15,603 --> 00:53:18,163
I shall visit Mother Hayme, now.

406
00:53:18,603 --> 00:53:20,963
Let me say hello to her.
Take care.

407
00:53:21,643 --> 00:53:22,803
Thank you.

408
00:53:57,963 --> 00:53:59,803
This is as far as we go.

409
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:03,683
From here, you'll go on your own.

410
00:54:04,363 --> 00:54:05,443
Very well.

411
00:54:06,283 --> 00:54:07,763
We'll find our way.

412
00:54:18,003 --> 00:54:19,043
Come on.

413
00:54:38,283 --> 00:54:40,803
What do we do now, brother?

414
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:45,963
Ertuğrul Bey marked a place of meeting,
we'll go there and wait for him.

415
00:54:46,123 --> 00:54:48,003
Did he mark a meeting point?

416
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:50,043
Where is that place?

417
00:54:54,003 --> 00:54:55,883
Remember this place, Turgut.

418
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:03,683
If anything bad happens,
we'll meet here.

419
00:55:04,563 --> 00:55:08,403
We'll go back to the tribe together,
no matter what happens.

420
00:55:10,483 --> 00:55:12,723
Of course, my bey. As you order.

421
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:23,443
Ertuğrul Bey knew something bad
would happen here from the beginning.

422
00:55:23,763 --> 00:55:25,643
That's why he showed me that place.

423
00:55:28,363 --> 00:55:31,163
It's not good for Ertuğrul Bey
to stay there, brother.

424
00:55:31,283 --> 00:55:33,003
It's not good!

425
00:55:33,923 --> 00:55:38,723
Ertuğrul Bey ensured the peace deal
by sending us in advance.

426
00:55:42,163 --> 00:55:47,283
Maybe he sacrificed himself
just for the sake of the state.

427
00:55:50,323 --> 00:55:52,203
Ertuğrul Bey can't stay there.

428
00:55:52,563 --> 00:55:54,763
He can't stay there, brother.

429
00:55:54,923 --> 00:55:56,643
We won't go home before we have him.

430
00:55:56,843 --> 00:55:58,603
We won't go back to the tribe without him.

431
00:55:58,683 --> 00:56:00,883
-Of course, we won't.
-We will not!

432
00:56:03,683 --> 00:56:05,443
We will spend the night here.

433
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:08,283
The Mongols will probably follow us.

434
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:12,003
Tomorrow, we'll get rid of them
and go to the meeting point.

435
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:15,763
And we won't go to the tribe
before we have my Ertuğrul Bey.

436
00:56:16,203 --> 00:56:17,443
We will not!

437
00:56:17,523 --> 00:56:20,523
Of course, we won't! We will not, brother!

438
00:56:21,843 --> 00:56:23,843
Of course! Let's go.

439
00:56:27,523 --> 00:56:30,203
Come on, boy. Come on.

440
00:56:45,283 --> 00:56:46,243
What is Ertuğrul doing?

441
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:49,683
He is waiting for you for dinner,
as you ordered.

442
00:56:53,003 --> 00:56:55,843
Don't let him out of his tent
unless I say so.

443
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:22,603
Seeing you sitting in a Mongolian tent

444
00:57:23,123 --> 00:57:27,603
with such a victorious pose
is a great honor, Ertuğrul.

445
00:57:36,483 --> 00:57:39,443
Or should I say Sultan Ertuğrul?

446
00:57:42,443 --> 00:57:43,643
Take a seat, Noyan.

447
00:57:59,283 --> 00:58:00,723
Bring everything.

448
00:58:05,563 --> 00:58:08,683
Let me embarrass Ertuğrul
by being a better host than him.

449
00:58:20,843 --> 00:58:23,683
You never forget about anything, do you?

450
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:26,483
I can be as furious as a lion,

451
00:58:27,443 --> 00:58:29,563
and as stubborn as a camel, Ertuğrul.

452
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:34,923
Yet, I know you are not so different.

453
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,163
So...

454
00:58:39,323 --> 00:58:41,403
why did you change your mind

455
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:44,923
and betrayed your beloved sultan
and your state, huh?

456
00:58:47,163 --> 00:58:50,123
You know very well
that I didn't betray the state.

457
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:53,163
You didn't do it for gold,

458
00:58:53,843 --> 00:58:55,203
but you did it for the throne.

459
00:58:55,923 --> 00:59:01,323
You once told me to join
Ögedei Khan's wild river...

460
00:59:02,483 --> 00:59:04,003
with our swords and horses,

461
00:59:05,363 --> 00:59:09,843
and run wild in Ögedei's river.

462
00:59:12,203 --> 00:59:15,323
You also said
that I shouldn't swim against the current.

463
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:20,123
I wanted to be a drop of water

464
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:24,203
in Ögedei Khan's wild river,
and run wild.

465
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:28,323
That's all I can say.

466
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,843
Do you still have doubts about me?

467
00:59:41,523 --> 00:59:43,643
You know, that young sultan...

468
00:59:45,043 --> 00:59:47,243
he seems to be braver than you, Ertuğrul.

469
00:59:49,683 --> 00:59:51,603
He won't go without a fight.

470
00:59:54,163 --> 00:59:55,763
For his bravery,

471
00:59:56,203 --> 01:00:00,123
I'll impale him and expose his corpse
in the streets of Konya.

472
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:07,523
And if you betray Ögedei Khan...

473
01:00:08,963 --> 01:00:11,803
I'll slay your children in the tribe...

474
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:17,803
of your father, Suleyman Shah,
and I'll obliterate your kin.

475
01:00:19,883 --> 01:00:21,123
Don't you forget this.

476
01:00:59,403 --> 01:01:02,043
My girl, we liked you so much.

477
01:01:02,523 --> 01:01:07,283
You have not only helped us,
but many people in the tribe.

478
01:01:09,203 --> 01:01:11,083
I'd like to gift this to you...

479
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:14,723
if you choose to accept it.

480
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:29,843
What a lovely dress.

481
01:01:31,643 --> 01:01:33,123
What a kind gesture.

482
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:38,323
I'm the one who is grateful, Mother Hayme.

483
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:42,763
You made me experience the family feeling
I had long forgotten.

484
01:01:43,963 --> 01:01:47,043
Hopefully, we'll have many good days
together, my girl.

485
01:01:50,963 --> 01:01:52,443
Now, let us eat.

486
01:02:13,003 --> 01:02:14,683
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

487
01:02:15,203 --> 01:02:16,203
Here, my girl.

488
01:02:27,483 --> 01:02:30,683
What's up, Mother Hayme?
You seem a little sad.

489
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:40,203
I can't even sleep since Ertuğrul went

490
01:02:40,843 --> 01:02:43,163
with that accursed Noyan.

491
01:02:43,923 --> 01:02:49,403
It has been a long time,
but there is still no word of him.

492
01:02:51,323 --> 01:02:55,683
That evil bastard is capable
of doing anything.

493
01:02:58,283 --> 01:03:00,483
I am worried about my son.

494
01:03:03,123 --> 01:03:04,923
You are right, Mother Hayme.

495
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,243
He is an unpredictable traitor.

496
01:03:09,803 --> 01:03:15,443
I wish they didn't stop me
from killing him when he came here.

497
01:03:18,283 --> 01:03:20,483
We can deal
with our unfinished business...

498
01:03:21,483 --> 01:03:26,643
once Ertuğrul is here
and when the time is right.

499
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:31,403
Hopefully, Mother Hayme.
I can't wait for that day.

500
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:35,363
That murderer Noyan killed so many,

501
01:03:36,123 --> 01:03:38,643
upset so many people.

502
01:03:39,523 --> 01:03:41,243
You are right, Almıla Hatun.

503
01:03:41,963 --> 01:03:44,563
He made everyone feel sad.

504
01:03:46,803 --> 01:03:51,163
But sooner or later,
God's justice will find that bastard.

505
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:55,603
Hopefully, my girl.

506
01:03:57,323 --> 01:03:59,683
Come on, enjoy.

507
01:04:07,123 --> 01:04:09,563
Ögedei Khan gave me this task.

508
01:04:10,323 --> 01:04:15,483
But what can I do in the great Anatolia
with a bunch of alps at my command?

509
01:04:18,523 --> 01:04:21,403
Don't you worry, Ertuğrul.

510
01:04:23,323 --> 01:04:28,163
Many Turkish alps in Anatolia
are waiting to accept our rule.

511
01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:33,643
Our spies have spread everywhere.

512
01:04:35,043 --> 01:04:37,323
They'll all be at your command.

513
01:04:38,643 --> 01:04:44,043
Anatolia is a tough place.
It's not like anywhere else you fought in.

514
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:49,123
There are Oghuz tribes everywhere...

515
01:04:50,243 --> 01:04:53,283
in Anatolia, waiting in battle formation.

516
01:04:55,363 --> 01:05:00,283
Will your men be enough to beat them?

517
01:05:03,163 --> 01:05:04,603
They will be more than enough.

518
01:05:06,123 --> 01:05:12,003
Your duty is to open up the gates
of Konya for us

519
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:17,523
without causing us to lose
a single soldier.

520
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:23,003
I presumed you had men everywhere.

521
01:05:25,203 --> 01:05:28,483
You wouldn't have come to Anatolia
or Karacahisar...

522
01:05:30,003 --> 01:05:32,123
if you hadn't secured it for yourself.

523
01:05:34,803 --> 01:05:40,363
You'll have to gain my trust in order
to get more information, Ertuğrul.

524
01:05:42,803 --> 01:05:45,203
And to gain my trust,

525
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:49,483
you'll bring one of the children
of your late wife, Halime Hatun,

526
01:05:52,163 --> 01:05:54,923
then you'll learn
where my men are positioned.

527
01:05:57,283 --> 01:06:01,563
And then, instead of using the swords,

528
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:03,803
we'll use our brains and enthrone you.

529
01:06:06,243 --> 01:06:11,603
Then, I shall explain all my plans
to you in detail, tomorrow.

530
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:18,763
I'll help you get rid of the obstacles
so that your army can march.

531
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:24,883
We'll see, Ertuğrul. We will see.

532
01:06:33,763 --> 01:06:37,163
And before I forget...

533
01:06:38,723 --> 01:06:41,243
The tribe of your brother, Gündoğdu,

534
01:06:42,043 --> 01:06:45,123
is located near the Calap Mountain
right now.

535
01:06:46,643 --> 01:06:50,643
He also doesn't go too far in the winter.

536
01:06:53,683 --> 01:06:56,283
If you fail to do your job,

537
01:06:57,443 --> 01:07:01,403
your brother's tribe will go down first.

538
01:07:04,283 --> 01:07:06,363
It's up to you.

539
01:07:07,683 --> 01:07:10,803
You either go there
and drink a cold ayran,

540
01:07:12,123 --> 01:07:13,883
or you'll be drinking their blood.

541
01:07:16,523 --> 01:07:19,803
Think it through, Ertuğrul.

542
01:07:22,363 --> 01:07:26,363
We'll have a very important conversation
in the morning.

543
01:07:28,603 --> 01:07:29,923
Farewell for now.

544
01:08:00,203 --> 01:08:04,123
Keep an eye on him
and increase the security level.

545
01:08:05,003 --> 01:08:06,723
As you order, Noyan.

546
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:28,163
The Mongols won't stop following us
until we leave their territory.

547
01:08:30,323 --> 01:08:34,603
We'll get rid of them at dawn
and go to the rendezvous point.

548
01:08:36,323 --> 01:08:38,043
Don't worry, Bamsi.

549
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:43,443
Why did our bey stay there?
Why did he do that?

550
01:08:43,603 --> 01:08:45,203
It seems the situation is tough.

551
01:08:46,403 --> 01:08:49,883
He couldn't even speak to us
while Noyan was there.

552
01:08:51,323 --> 01:08:55,043
We'll find out everything
once we get to the meeting point.

553
01:08:55,643 --> 01:08:58,363
What if Ertuğrul Bey can't make it there?

554
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:02,643
What if the Mongols don't let
Ertuğrul Bey go?

555
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:05,003
Then, we'll go and get him.

556
01:09:05,123 --> 01:09:07,203
From the headquarters of Ögedei Khan?

557
01:09:07,883 --> 01:09:11,003
Yes, brother. From the headquarters
of Ögedei Khan.

558
01:09:11,283 --> 01:09:15,603
We can burn that headquarters
to the ground and get our bey.

559
01:09:15,963 --> 01:09:17,363
For sure.

560
01:09:17,643 --> 01:09:19,563
Well said, Bamsi.

561
01:09:20,563 --> 01:09:24,763
We can't go back to our home
without taking our bey with us.

562
01:09:27,803 --> 01:09:29,883
We'll either be free together,

563
01:09:30,883 --> 01:09:32,563
or we'll become martyrs together.

564
01:09:32,843 --> 01:09:34,283
Of course.

565
01:09:50,523 --> 01:09:51,523
Come on.

566
01:10:03,363 --> 01:10:09,083
Oh, my girl Almıla.
You look so beautiful.

567
01:10:11,323 --> 01:10:13,123
Appreciated, Mother Hayme.

568
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:19,523
Almıla Hatun, do you only sell leather?

569
01:10:20,003 --> 01:10:23,323
Yes, Gündüz Alp. We only sell leather.

570
01:10:23,483 --> 01:10:24,963
It's the only thing we know.

571
01:10:25,163 --> 01:10:28,563
So, how do you get leathers, Almıla Hatun?

572
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:37,523
We skin the animal we hunt, Gündüz Alp.

573
01:10:38,523 --> 01:10:43,403
Then, we clean those skins
and leave them to dry under the sun.

574
01:10:44,803 --> 01:10:47,283
Then, they are ready to be used.

575
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:51,803
So, how do you hunt animals, Almıla Hatun?

576
01:10:56,083 --> 01:10:58,163
With our bows and arrows, Gündüz Alp.

577
01:10:58,363 --> 01:11:02,283
But hunting is a delicate business.

578
01:11:03,603 --> 01:11:09,323
First of all, you shouldn't be cruel
to the animal and torture it.

579
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:16,083
That's why we sharpen our arrow so much
that the animals die instantly.

580
01:11:17,163 --> 01:11:19,763
That's the most important rule of hunting.

581
01:11:21,763 --> 01:11:25,723
Also, you shouldn't come so close
to the animal you are hunting,

582
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:28,123
because they might get scared
and run away.

583
01:11:29,123 --> 01:11:33,363
That's why we build our arrows
to go as far as possible.

584
01:11:34,163 --> 01:11:37,043
Can we go hunting one day, Almıla Hatun?

585
01:11:40,443 --> 01:11:41,723
Sure, Gündüz Alp.

586
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:45,483
Of course we can go hunting,
once you are old enough

587
01:11:45,603 --> 01:11:47,083
to shoot an arrow.

588
01:11:48,163 --> 01:11:50,243
I'll teach you how to shoot birds.

589
01:11:51,123 --> 01:11:52,923
Really, Almıla Hatun?

590
01:11:53,323 --> 01:11:57,323
Of course, Gündüz Alp.
But only if your grandmother allows it.

591
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:03,403
Sure thing, my Gündüz.
Why wouldn't I allow it?

592
01:12:03,963 --> 01:12:09,123
You should learn to hunt
once you are old enough.

593
01:12:11,643 --> 01:12:14,123
I'll go and check my Osman, now.

594
01:12:14,803 --> 01:12:17,483
You keep chatting with Gündüz.

595
01:12:18,803 --> 01:12:20,523
Don't worry, Mother Hayme.

596
01:12:22,243 --> 01:12:23,923
Oh, my kind boy!

597
01:12:24,043 --> 01:12:26,723
Helping his grandmother. My sweetie!

598
01:13:56,403 --> 01:13:57,923
My God...

599
01:13:59,043 --> 01:14:01,763
please protect Ertuğrul and his alps...

600
01:14:02,923 --> 01:14:08,483
during their tough mission,
and help them to come home safe and sound.

601
01:14:10,323 --> 01:14:14,203
Unite these innocent children
with their father.

602
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:18,443
Make him victorious
in any battle he fights.

603
01:14:19,363 --> 01:14:22,403
You are omnipotent.

604
01:14:23,683 --> 01:14:27,843
For the sake of our prophet,

605
01:14:28,483 --> 01:14:31,443
please spare Ertuğrul's life.

606
01:14:32,963 --> 01:14:34,643
Don't make me lose a son...

607
01:14:35,803 --> 01:14:38,923
and don't make these innocent children
lose their father.

608
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:41,643
My God.

609
01:14:48,043 --> 01:14:49,043
Amen.

610
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:51,843
Why are they hitting the drums, Carmagun?

611
01:15:52,483 --> 01:15:53,763
Is it because of Ertuğrul?

612
01:15:54,163 --> 01:15:57,923
A messenger has arrived
bringing news from Ögedei Khan.

613
01:16:00,483 --> 01:16:01,483
Let him come.

614
01:16:14,923 --> 01:16:16,243
What's wrong with you?

615
01:16:17,243 --> 01:16:20,163
Why the tears?

616
01:16:21,403 --> 01:16:22,403
Speak up.

617
01:16:25,603 --> 01:16:26,923
Ögedei Khan...

618
01:16:29,643 --> 01:16:31,123
What about Ögedei Khan?

619
01:16:35,003 --> 01:16:36,283
During a feast...

620
01:16:37,883 --> 01:16:39,483
he passed away.

621
01:16:47,443 --> 01:16:51,843
Ögedei!

622
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:56,243
Ögedei!

623
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:05,363
Ögedei Khan!

624
01:17:08,963 --> 01:17:10,803
What are you saying, huh?

625
01:17:13,163 --> 01:17:14,443
What are you saying?

626
01:17:15,483 --> 01:17:18,803
How did my khan pass away?

627
01:17:19,163 --> 01:17:21,163
He was just fine this morning.

628
01:17:21,563 --> 01:17:24,043
It happened all of a sudden, Noyan.

629
01:17:24,243 --> 01:17:25,763
I was there while he was dying.

630
01:17:26,443 --> 01:17:31,403
He just collapsed.

631
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:50,363
He was standing his ground just like
the holy Burkhan Khaldun mountain,

632
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:53,523
yet he passed away.

633
01:17:58,523 --> 01:18:00,603
We are in grief.

634
01:18:01,923 --> 01:18:03,523
Cut the hair.

635
01:18:04,923 --> 01:18:08,083
May the eyes shed tears of blood.

636
01:18:22,763 --> 01:18:25,323
May the earth cry and the sky be happy.

637
01:18:27,243 --> 01:18:29,683
My Khan Ögedei is on his way to Ocmah.

638
01:18:32,643 --> 01:18:35,883
May Tengri greet him with good spirits.

639
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,723
May he take a place next to Genghis Khan.

640
01:18:47,883 --> 01:18:53,243
Let his wife Töregene,
and his son Göyük Khan know.

641
01:18:53,683 --> 01:18:55,403
As you order, Noyan.

642
01:18:59,043 --> 01:19:02,363
His burial site will be secret.

643
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:07,003
The slaves who will bury him...

644
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:12,043
will be killed with his animals
and widows.

645
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:18,403
They'll have the honor of being buried
with the goods of our khan.

646
01:19:23,843 --> 01:19:25,563
Ögedei's spirit...

647
01:19:26,563 --> 01:19:30,203
will protect his army and his tribe.

648
01:19:54,443 --> 01:19:57,403
Ögedei!

649
01:20:15,803 --> 01:20:17,723
What is going on outside?

650
01:20:17,923 --> 01:20:19,283
Accursed Turk!

651
01:20:20,843 --> 01:20:23,523
Ögedei Khan died the day you arrived.

652
01:20:24,643 --> 01:20:29,163
You'll not leave here alive!
May the spirits curse you.

653
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:41,563
The so-called deal is over, Noyan.

654
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:17,563
Ögedei is gone,
the deal is done, Ertuğrul.

655
01:21:19,403 --> 01:21:21,963
Now, I'll send you to Tamag.

656
01:22:25,963 --> 01:22:27,563
Ertuğrul!

657
01:22:50,443 --> 01:22:51,803
Ertuğrul has escaped!

658
01:22:52,243 --> 01:22:53,683
Ertuğrul has escaped!

659
01:22:53,923 --> 01:22:55,203
Get on your horses!

660
01:22:55,523 --> 01:22:57,963
Soldiers, get on your horses!

661
01:22:58,283 --> 01:23:01,483
We won't come back until we find him!

662
01:23:08,643 --> 01:23:10,763
I'll hunt you down, Ertuğrul.

663
01:23:11,203 --> 01:23:13,283
I will tie you by your feet, first.

664
01:23:13,843 --> 01:23:15,923
Then, I'll rip your heart out.

665
01:23:17,003 --> 01:23:21,083
I will squeeze it so hard

666
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:23,963
even the Seljuks will hear your groans.

667
01:23:24,443 --> 01:23:29,203
There will be Oghuz's blood
flowing in Firat and Dicle...

668
01:23:29,843 --> 01:23:32,163
instead of just water.

669
01:24:00,683 --> 01:24:02,803
May I come in, Günalp Bey?

670
01:24:03,443 --> 01:24:04,443
Come.

671
01:24:11,723 --> 01:24:14,403
-Have the messengers left the castle?
-Yes, Günalp Bey.

672
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,883
-Is everything ready?
-Yes, Günalp Bey.

673
01:24:16,963 --> 01:24:20,203
Our soldiers are positioned on the road.
We have the strategic points.

674
01:24:20,563 --> 01:24:21,843
Very well.

675
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:25,963
If Mongols try to attack our land,

676
01:24:26,883 --> 01:24:29,203
it's our duty to repel them.

677
01:24:29,483 --> 01:24:30,803
As you say, Günalp Bey.

678
01:24:31,323 --> 01:24:32,323
Let's go.

679
01:24:34,843 --> 01:24:35,843
The door!

680
01:28:22,283 --> 01:28:25,523
His horse is wounded.
He might have escaped to the jungle.

681
01:28:26,683 --> 01:28:28,403
We'll leave the horses here.

682
01:28:29,123 --> 01:28:32,603
Have someone guard the horses.
We will find him.

683
01:30:11,763 --> 01:30:14,323
-Welcome.
-Thank you, Artuk Bey.

684
01:30:15,723 --> 01:30:19,483
Almıla Hatun mentioned your request.

685
01:30:20,523 --> 01:30:23,843
Of course, we'll do all we can
to help you conduct your business safely.

686
01:30:25,363 --> 01:30:30,003
Our alps will be accompanying you
and ensuring your safety.

687
01:30:31,043 --> 01:30:36,163
We knew you'd not leave us alone,
Artuk Bey. Thank you.

688
01:30:37,003 --> 01:30:38,403
Of course.

689
01:30:46,603 --> 01:30:48,363
Eynece, Karamis.

690
01:30:48,923 --> 01:30:50,643
Be careful.

691
01:30:51,003 --> 01:30:53,443
Help those in need
you come across on the road.

692
01:30:55,163 --> 01:30:57,923
Don't forget to give presents to children.

693
01:30:59,603 --> 01:31:01,563
As you order, Almıla Hatun.

694
01:31:02,883 --> 01:31:04,883
Safe travels and goodbye.

695
01:31:05,603 --> 01:31:07,003
Goodbye, Almıla Hatun.

696
01:31:12,163 --> 01:31:13,363
Come on, alps!

697
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:24,621
-He went this way.
-Hurry.

698
01:33:54,581 --> 01:33:57,781
I'll slay you all, you Mongolian bastards.

699
01:34:16,501 --> 01:34:17,741
Come on, my lions.

700
01:34:34,381 --> 01:34:35,381
Come on, my lions!

701
01:34:39,301 --> 01:34:40,661
God is the greatest!

702
01:36:03,421 --> 01:36:04,781
Save your breath.

703
01:36:06,781 --> 01:36:10,941
You have a lot to say
about the Mongols stationed here.

704
01:36:19,261 --> 01:36:21,141
I'll make you sing like a bird.

705
01:37:08,941 --> 01:37:10,581
You are surrounded, Ertuğrul.

706
01:37:12,181 --> 01:37:13,221
There is no escape.

707
01:37:17,861 --> 01:37:22,141
A wolf doesn't think
about escaping when ambushed.

708
01:37:22,901 --> 01:37:25,341
It thinks about its revenge.

709
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:28,541
Really?

710
01:37:29,901 --> 01:37:32,261
But it's my turn to take revenge.

711
01:37:33,461 --> 01:37:35,861
You'll pay for what you did to me.

712
01:37:40,141 --> 01:37:41,181
Attack!

713
01:38:37,021 --> 01:38:38,821
What kind of a disloyal dog are you?

714
01:38:40,861 --> 01:38:44,141
You are acting against
the orders of your own leader.

715
01:38:45,781 --> 01:38:48,141
My leader passed away, Ertuğrul.

716
01:38:49,221 --> 01:38:53,061
His orders vanished with him.

717
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:58,421
It has been a long time
since I saw you strung up like this.

718
01:38:59,501 --> 01:39:01,221
Do you remember those days?

719
01:39:01,581 --> 01:39:02,661
Show mercy.

720
01:39:03,861 --> 01:39:05,941
God, please help us.

721
01:39:06,381 --> 01:39:08,621
-God, help us.
-Mercy.

722
01:39:09,261 --> 01:39:10,621
Help us.

723
01:39:11,501 --> 01:39:13,821
We didn't do anything.

724
01:39:17,901 --> 01:39:19,141
Who are you?

725
01:39:19,901 --> 01:39:21,461
I'm the demon of this hell.

726
01:39:26,181 --> 01:39:28,061
Welcome to the world of the Mongols.

727
01:39:38,541 --> 01:39:41,661
Look, I have you in my claws again.

728
01:39:48,421 --> 01:39:51,221
I would gladly sacrifice my life
for my holy cause.

729
01:39:51,941 --> 01:39:54,341
But I won't bow my head
before bastards like you.

730
01:39:56,701 --> 01:39:59,621
You are about to die,
yet you are still so proud.

731
01:40:01,221 --> 01:40:05,261
Even if I die,
my holy cause will carry on.

732
01:40:06,941 --> 01:40:11,021
Sooner or later,
my kin will have revenge, Noyan.

733
01:40:13,541 --> 01:40:16,821
Now, do whatever you wish.

734
01:40:39,781 --> 01:40:41,741
With the weight of this stone,

735
01:40:42,461 --> 01:40:45,581
your flesh will begin to slip
from your bones.

736
01:40:46,141 --> 01:40:48,861
You had better start talking soon,

737
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:50,861
or you'll start to die.

738
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:52,741
I don't know anything!

739
01:40:54,101 --> 01:40:55,781
Who are the other spies?

740
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:58,021
Where are they stationed?

741
01:40:59,421 --> 01:41:01,101
Is Noyan the one giving you orders?

742
01:41:01,581 --> 01:41:05,141
-Tell me everything.
-I have nothing to tell!

743
01:41:06,021 --> 01:41:07,621
Oh, is that so?

744
01:41:09,701 --> 01:41:13,461
Dumrul, he doesn't want to talk,
which means it is not painful enough.

745
01:41:15,381 --> 01:41:16,941
He'll start singing like a bird...

746
01:41:18,861 --> 01:41:20,621
if he feels more pain, Günalp Bey.

747
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:22,621
Go on, then.

748
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:13,021
You are a brave man, Ertuğrul.

749
01:42:16,021 --> 01:42:18,421
You even tried to trick my leader.

750
01:42:21,901 --> 01:42:24,141
You put me
in a difficult position, Ertuğrul.

751
01:42:28,781 --> 01:42:31,421
A man like you shouldn't die so easily.

752
01:42:32,301 --> 01:42:34,941
Get on with whatever
you're going to do, Noyan.

753
01:42:36,461 --> 01:42:38,541
I am not afraid of death.

754
01:42:42,101 --> 01:42:45,341
First, I'll cut off the feet
with which you tried to escape.

755
01:42:47,981 --> 01:42:51,861
Then, I'll rip off the arms
with which you swung your sword at me.

756
01:42:54,061 --> 01:42:57,821
Piece by piece, you'll die, Ertuğrul.

757
01:42:58,861 --> 01:43:00,661
Do whatever you want, Noyan.

758
01:43:01,781 --> 01:43:03,621
Do whatever you want, Noyan!

759
01:43:04,301 --> 01:43:06,901
You were only able to catch me
with the aid of a dozen men.

760
01:43:09,621 --> 01:43:11,701
You have never beaten me fairly.

761
01:43:22,301 --> 01:43:23,621
We are here, my bey!

762
01:45:02,821 --> 01:45:04,101
Come on, go!

763
01:45:17,861 --> 01:45:21,021
Let's see what the Mongols do
when their horses are gone.

764
01:45:30,221 --> 01:45:32,781
I'll take you in the name of Ertuğrul Bey.

765
01:45:34,941 --> 01:45:37,821
Come on, boy.

766
01:45:52,661 --> 01:45:53,701
Noyan!

767
01:45:54,101 --> 01:45:55,901
Noyan, Noyan, Noyan.

768
01:46:10,621 --> 01:46:11,621
Noyan!

769
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:39,861
Come now, Ertuğrul. Come.

770
01:46:40,821 --> 01:46:44,821
Turn your sword towards me,
not towards those rookies.

771
01:46:45,101 --> 01:46:47,901
Peace cannot be achieved
when there are people like you, Noyan.

772
01:46:49,781 --> 01:46:52,461
Now, it's time
to spill your poisonous blood.

773
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:54,981
Peace is for cowards, Ertuğrul.

774
01:46:56,341 --> 01:46:58,581
This world isn't big enough
for the two of us.

775
01:46:59,261 --> 01:47:00,701
Do you still not get it?

776
01:47:01,981 --> 01:47:04,381
I will kill you, no matter what.

777
01:47:04,821 --> 01:47:06,301
Go on then, Noyan.

778
01:47:06,941 --> 01:47:09,101
Let's see which one of us will die.

779
01:47:29,981 --> 01:47:33,181
Fall back! His troops are here!

780
01:47:44,861 --> 01:47:47,661
Fall back! To the horses! Come on!

781
01:47:48,261 --> 01:47:51,061
Shoot your arrows! Shoot your arrows!

782
01:47:52,181 --> 01:47:53,101
Come on!

783
01:48:00,621 --> 01:48:03,261
You won't get to Anatolia alive, Ertuğrul!

784
01:48:05,141 --> 01:48:06,901
After them!

785
01:48:28,261 --> 01:48:29,741
Enough! Okay!

786
01:48:30,341 --> 01:48:32,581
Enough! I'll talk, enough!

787
01:48:33,661 --> 01:48:36,021
-Get me down.
-See? He wants to talk.

788
01:48:40,901 --> 01:48:43,941
Give me your answer, first.

789
01:48:44,981 --> 01:48:46,821
Noyan sent us in as advance guards.

790
01:48:51,541 --> 01:48:52,701
What was your mission?

791
01:48:53,461 --> 01:48:55,861
To gather information
and convey it to Noyan.

792
01:49:00,461 --> 01:49:02,821
What about the spies
disguised as merchants?

793
01:49:03,141 --> 01:49:04,701
They were supposed to go to the bazaar.

794
01:49:05,381 --> 01:49:08,941
Who are the other spies here?
Who are Noyan's other men?

795
01:49:09,701 --> 01:49:11,421
Right now, there is no one.

796
01:49:11,981 --> 01:49:13,341
But there will be!

797
01:49:14,621 --> 01:49:15,621
Who are they?

798
01:49:16,101 --> 01:49:18,101
They haven't come to these lands yet.

799
01:49:19,581 --> 01:49:20,941
They'll come from the east.

800
01:49:21,381 --> 01:49:24,141
I also know other things. Let me down!

801
01:49:24,741 --> 01:49:28,421
I know about the other spies
stationed in the tribes! Let me down!

802
01:49:30,461 --> 01:49:32,541
Dumrul, let him down.

803
01:49:33,421 --> 01:49:35,341
Soldiers, let him down.

804
01:49:37,141 --> 01:49:39,061
I'll take him to the Kayi tribe.

805
01:49:41,621 --> 01:49:45,221
He can tell everything to Ertuğrul Bey
once he arrives.

806
01:49:47,101 --> 01:49:49,261
We'll also learn about those
coming to these lands...

807
01:49:50,461 --> 01:49:53,461
-from the east.
-Very well, Günalp Bey.

808
01:49:58,301 --> 01:49:59,221
My bey...

809
01:50:00,741 --> 01:50:03,861
I let most of their horses go,
but took one for you.

810
01:50:03,941 --> 01:50:08,221
Good man. Come on.
We need to get to the sea before them.

811
01:50:50,781 --> 01:50:52,941
-The horses are gone, sir.
-What?

812
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:57,181
-They let our horses free, it seems.
-How can a soldier lose his horse, huh?

813
01:51:04,341 --> 01:51:06,461
Alangoya will take care of this.

814
01:51:07,421 --> 01:51:09,381
Send a messenger to Alangoya right now.

815
01:51:10,101 --> 01:51:13,301
Tell her to kill Ertuğrul
and his children.

816
01:51:14,021 --> 01:51:17,261
I will spit on their graves
once I enter Anatolia.

817
01:51:55,381 --> 01:51:58,501
Look, Grandmother.
I'm getting used to this.

818
01:51:58,901 --> 01:52:00,981
Marvelous, good boy.

819
01:52:01,741 --> 01:52:04,301
-Marvelous.
-Thank you, Grandmother.

820
01:52:14,621 --> 01:52:18,221
My Gündüz is starting to tame wild horses,

821
01:52:19,101 --> 01:52:21,501
just like my Ertuğrul does.

822
01:52:26,861 --> 01:52:28,421
Come on, sit with me, my girl.

823
01:52:37,661 --> 01:52:38,821
Almıla, my girl.

824
01:52:40,141 --> 01:52:43,221
You are practically one of us, now.

825
01:52:44,781 --> 01:52:50,101
That's why I want you
to stay in the tribe.

826
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:53,501
You don't need to hang around
with men anymore.

827
01:52:56,501 --> 01:52:57,661
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

828
01:52:59,901 --> 01:53:02,381
I am without words.

829
01:53:04,581 --> 01:53:08,061
I'm thrilled to know
that you like me so much

830
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:09,421
you want me to stay.

831
01:53:09,981 --> 01:53:13,581
But I don't want to be a burden to you.

832
01:53:14,861 --> 01:53:18,901
What burden, my girl? On the contrary,
you're a great help to us.

833
01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:24,501
A lady like you always has a place
in the tribe of Ertuğrul Bey.

834
01:53:28,341 --> 01:53:33,821
Then I'll embrace you as my own mother,
and the tribe as my own tribe.

835
01:53:37,301 --> 01:53:38,621
Now, that's more like it.

836
01:53:39,261 --> 01:53:42,341
We'll have them prepare
a nice tent for you, huh?

837
01:53:42,421 --> 01:53:43,421
Okay, Mother Hayme.

838
01:53:49,141 --> 01:53:50,341
I wonder what that is.

839
01:53:51,541 --> 01:53:52,541
Someone is coming.

840
01:53:59,461 --> 01:54:02,461
-Günalp Bey.
-What happened, Günalp Bey?

841
01:54:36,101 --> 01:54:37,221
Who is he, Günalp Bey?

842
01:54:37,901 --> 01:54:41,501
A Mongol spy who was trying
to infiltrate our lands.

843
01:54:46,421 --> 01:54:49,221
I'll keep him locked up
until Ertuğrul Bey arrives.

844
01:54:54,181 --> 01:54:55,261
Take him away.

845
01:55:36,461 --> 01:55:38,901
Günalp Bey, we are
the messengers from Konya.

846
01:55:42,221 --> 01:55:43,421
I hope it's nothing bad.

847
01:55:48,101 --> 01:55:49,621
What is it, Günalp Bey?

848
01:55:52,901 --> 01:55:56,901
I hope it's nothing bad.
What are our Sultan's orders?

849
01:56:02,221 --> 01:56:05,901
Our Sultan summons me to Konya
for a new task.

850
01:56:14,341 --> 01:56:15,421
Give me your blessings.

851
01:56:22,181 --> 01:56:23,101
They are yours.

852
01:56:26,541 --> 01:56:28,941
-May God protect you.
-Thank you, Mother.

853
01:56:29,621 --> 01:56:32,021
Give my best to Ertuğrul Bey.

854
01:56:32,381 --> 01:56:33,341
Of course.

855
01:57:19,821 --> 01:57:21,621
We need to rest the horses
before they collapse.

856
01:57:22,701 --> 01:57:26,021
-We have to get to the boat before them.
-They don't have horses, my bey.

857
01:57:26,101 --> 01:57:29,261
We will get to the boat
before them for sure.

858
01:57:29,981 --> 01:57:31,461
Let's rest the horses.

859
01:58:11,621 --> 01:58:16,021
Brother, let's tell our bey
all about Almıla.

860
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:20,261
Just wait, Bamsi. We'll tell him.

861
01:58:21,901 --> 01:58:23,581
When the right time comes.

862
01:58:37,901 --> 01:58:39,181
My bey.

863
01:58:40,101 --> 01:58:42,301
Why did you tell Ögedei
that you'd accept his offer?

864
01:58:43,701 --> 01:58:50,061
The reason for the peace deal
was to buy us time before Ögedei attacks.

865
01:58:55,501 --> 01:58:59,381
If I had told Ögedei my true thoughts...

866
01:59:00,861 --> 01:59:03,141
I'd have put the state's survival at risk.

867
01:59:06,661 --> 01:59:07,621
Very well, my bey.

868
01:59:11,981 --> 01:59:14,901
I wanted to find out
how many men Noyan has in our lands.

869
01:59:19,101 --> 01:59:23,261
But he was too suspicious of me

870
01:59:24,741 --> 01:59:25,741
and he revealed nothing.

871
01:59:31,621 --> 01:59:32,861
We have some information.

872
01:59:35,581 --> 01:59:36,661
What do you mean, Turgut?

873
01:59:38,901 --> 01:59:40,621
