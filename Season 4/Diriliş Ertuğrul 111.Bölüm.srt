1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 111 will start after 12:40 min.

2
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,987
You can't do that to me!

3
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:01,787
I came here as a guest.

4
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:05,107
You are taking me to be publicly executed!

5
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,667
The emperor will make you pay for this.

6
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:09,267
Shut up and move.

7
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,387
What do you think you are doing?

8
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:29,187
How could you put
a state official in dungeon?

9
00:13:29,787 --> 00:13:34,427
Hereafter, you will obey
only Ertuğrul Bey.

10
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:39,187
Or you will suffer the consequences.

11
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:43,187
Never mind, Aydoğmus.

12
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:48,427
Our state will do what is necessary.

13
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:19,787
Sadettin Köpek.

14
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,587
He tried to betray us again
by using Günalp.

15
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:28,347
His plan has backfired, brother.

16
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:34,307
Hereafter, we will take more precautions.

17
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:38,147
We will show no mercy to anybody.

18
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,147
Why are you not talking, Artuk Bey?

19
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:48,907
Tell me.

20
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:51,987
I have something to tell you.

21
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:55,347
But I don't know how.

22
00:14:58,187 --> 00:14:59,227
Tell me, Artuk Bey.

23
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,027
Your words are precious.

24
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,107
Bey,

25
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:11,947
I can't tell you what to do.

26
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:16,627
However, I disapprove of what you did
to the governor of Bilecik.

27
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:26,307
He might have come here to sign
a treaty that is disadvantageous for us.

28
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:28,427
And he might be our enemy.

29
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:33,187
However, Bey, he was invited here.

30
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:35,507
He came with a white flag.

31
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,307
It doesn't matter who invited him;

32
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,787
it isn't right to execute a man

33
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:44,227
who came with a white flag, Bey.

34
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:50,667
You are the bey.

35
00:17:20,187 --> 00:17:21,667
We are under attack! Go, alps!

36
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:27,467
It is an ambush, Leon.

37
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:39,667
Did you think I would let you go
with the governor of Bilecik?

38
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,067
You will die this time, bastard.

39
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:45,027
Attack, brothers.

40
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:46,267
Great God!

41
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,667
You're just in time, Ares.

42
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:29,707
These barbarians were going to kill us.

43
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:31,987
I am grateful to you.

44
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:33,387
I told you...

45
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:36,027
I was defeated, but I am alive,

46
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,907
Kritos.

47
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:44,867
Hereafter,

48
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:48,987
you will be at my side with the title
you deserve, Ares. I promise you.

49
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:51,227
I don't care about the titles.

50
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:53,427
What matters is our holy mission.

51
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,427
Ertuğrul is important.

52
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,827
Tomorrow, he'll go to Söğüt
to locate a new settlement.

53
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:17,307
I will make him pay heavily for this.

54
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:20,187
I will put his head in the center
of Söğüt.

55
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:24,787
We should go before more alps arrive.

56
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:27,947
-We need to return to the castle.
-Let's go.

57
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:31,907
Ertuğrul shouldn't come back alive
from Söğüt.

58
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:05,827
Is everybody okay?

59
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:07,507
We are fine.

60
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:08,787
We are fine.

61
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:10,387
We are fine.

62
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,587
Brother Ahmet fooled that heathen well.

63
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:31,747
Yes.

64
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:35,707
Ertuğrul Bey's plan is in motion now.

65
00:20:41,147 --> 00:20:44,227
They cruelly killed the young prince.

66
00:20:47,227 --> 00:20:49,027
I can't stop thinking about it.

67
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:54,467
Emir Sadettin and his crew won't stop
until they take over the state, Ertuğrul.

68
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:58,347
Sadettin Köpek.

69
00:20:59,787 --> 00:21:01,427
He will want to kill the sultan, too.

70
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:05,187
You are right, Ertuğrul Bey.

71
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,027
But he wants to deal with you first.

72
00:21:08,507 --> 00:21:12,787
A peace messenger came from Konya
for Governor Kritos.

73
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:17,747
What peace?

74
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,627
I don't know the details, but...

75
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,867
Governor Kritos went to Karacahisar
for peace talks.

76
00:21:28,027 --> 00:21:29,027
Köpek.

77
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:33,107
That bastard must be behind this.

78
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:39,907
By taking advantage of my absence,

79
00:21:40,307 --> 00:21:44,227
he will have Günalp Bey sign
a peace treaty.

80
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,187
What treaty is this, Ertuğrul?

81
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:48,787
A treaty that will hurt me, brother.

82
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:51,707
Otherwise, Emir Sadettin
wouldn't be behind this.

83
00:21:52,987 --> 00:21:56,107
If you are right, then Günalp Bey
represents the state, Bey.

84
00:21:56,387 --> 00:21:58,307
And he is Köpek's puppet,
doing as he says.

85
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:00,547
Ertuğrul Bey.

86
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:02,347
Just say the word.

87
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:05,147
I will kill Governor Kritos for you
right away.

88
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:08,107
Thank you, Ahmet.

89
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,027
Thank you.

90
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,987
However, we need him alive,
not dead.

91
00:22:15,227 --> 00:22:17,947
And you will gain his respect and trust.

92
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:20,707
How?

93
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,187
It is a difficult mission for you.

94
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,467
-Are you ready?
-Always, Ertuğrul Bey.

95
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:30,987
Then, listen to me very carefully.

96
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:38,747
You see, I apprehended the governor
of Bilecik intentionally,

97
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:42,027
so Ahmet would save him,
and gain his trust.

98
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:44,427
I swear to God, Bey,

99
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:47,627
I thought that Ertuğrul Bey
might have a secret plan.

100
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:51,827
But I just couldn't stop myself.

101
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:53,827
Thank God, Bey.

102
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:57,467
I hope everything goes
as you planned, Bey.

103
00:22:58,187 --> 00:22:59,187
{\an8}Thank you, Artuk Bey.

104
00:23:03,806 --> 00:23:06,486
Now, I'll go to Söğüt at once

105
00:23:07,206 --> 00:23:09,246
and decide on a place
for our tribe to settle.

106
00:23:09,726 --> 00:23:11,886
The Governor of Bilecik will be a problem,
my Bey<i>.</i>

107
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:13,846
He will certainly try to ambush you.

108
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:15,246
He knows you'll go there.

109
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:16,686
For sure, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

110
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:19,246
For sure.

111
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:23,978
But

112
00:23:24,618 --> 00:23:26,658
he will be the prey

113
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,258
while he thinks he is the hunter.

114
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:32,978
We'll clear the way

115
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:36,098
from the Governor of Bilecik
and all the other infidels.

116
00:23:40,058 --> 00:23:41,298
And then...

117
00:23:42,418 --> 00:23:44,218
it will be Sadettin Kopek's turn.

118
00:23:46,738 --> 00:23:49,818
It's high time for him to die.

119
00:23:51,618 --> 00:23:53,418
How are we going to do that

120
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,378
while he controls the state?

121
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:04,498
If the state digresses from its path,

122
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:07,418
then the traditions digress, too.

123
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,218
We will not let that happen.

124
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:14,738
Turks

125
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:15,978
would live

126
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:17,858
without food or water,

127
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:20,658
but...

128
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,378
not without their state.

129
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:31,018
Either this state becomes

130
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:33,378
a fair state...

131
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:37,178
or we will establish

132
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:40,818
a new one which is fair and just.

133
00:25:04,418 --> 00:25:06,538
I'll make you pay
for what you did, Ertuğrul.

134
00:25:08,018 --> 00:25:09,618
If you weren't a margrave of the state...

135
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:13,298
I will get out of here anyway.

136
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,338
Let's see what you will do then.

137
00:25:52,738 --> 00:25:53,738
What's wrong, alp<i>?</i>

138
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:57,618
My Bey<i>, </i>our alps got attacked
while they were taking the governor.

139
00:25:57,978 --> 00:25:59,058
They all became martyrs.

140
00:26:01,378 --> 00:26:02,298
Bastards.

141
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:18,578
Send alps there right now, brother.

142
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:22,618
Tell them not to come back
without finding those responsible.

143
00:27:31,498 --> 00:27:32,658
Long story short...

144
00:27:34,378 --> 00:27:36,858
I have not only escaped from Ertuğrul

145
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,338
but also created chaos
within the state of the Seljuks.

146
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:44,218
See,

147
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:45,618
Sultan Alaeddin .

148
00:27:46,338 --> 00:27:47,338
He is dead.

149
00:27:48,578 --> 00:27:50,978
The heir Kilicarslan
who was supported by Ertuğrul.

150
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:52,738
Also dead.

151
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:57,938
The state of the Seljuks is

152
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:00,018
in chaos.

153
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:04,258
And you contributed greatly
for this outcome, Ares.

154
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,298
Our emperor will also notice that.

155
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:10,138
Now, once Ertuğrul dies,

156
00:28:11,378 --> 00:28:13,658
and once we deal with Sadettin Kopek...

157
00:28:15,178 --> 00:28:17,498
Then, the Turks will cease to exist.

158
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:21,458
You've done so much, Ares.

159
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:25,618
Emir Sadettin.

160
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:29,298
He will be waiting for me
in the caravansary.

161
00:28:29,938 --> 00:28:30,778
But,

162
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,458
instead of me,

163
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,498
you'll go and meet him.

164
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:38,858
You'll be there as my envoy.

165
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:41,618
The only thing he wants

166
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:43,778
is to see Ertuğrul's death.

167
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:47,818
You'll tell him that I've set a trap

168
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:53,498
for Ertuğrul, but I want assurance
about Söğüt.

169
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:57,778
I have no doubt

170
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,538
that you'll do anything
to come to an agreement.

171
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,098
Am I mistaken?

172
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:05,578
Absolutely not, Kritos.

173
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:10,298
Leave Sadettin Kopek to me.

174
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:12,298
You go to Söğüt.

175
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:15,258
Get rid of Ertuğrul.

176
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:19,498
I will be in Söğüt

177
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:21,618
to kill Ertuğrul.

178
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:25,778
The big day is tomorrow.

179
00:29:26,818 --> 00:29:28,458
Cheers, my friend Ares.

180
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:33,618
Shit.

181
00:29:36,978 --> 00:29:37,978
Whatever.

182
00:29:38,498 --> 00:29:40,098
We'll toast next time.

183
00:29:41,178 --> 00:29:43,098
I will be waiting for good news
from you.

184
00:29:43,418 --> 00:29:44,418
Me too, Kritos.

185
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:47,778
I'll be waiting for the best news
from Söğüt.

186
00:30:34,218 --> 00:30:35,218
How could Altun Aba

187
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:37,098
disobey my orders

188
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:39,618
and dare to carry out such a massacre?

189
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:42,498
How could he murder a young man

190
00:30:43,098 --> 00:30:45,018
and a woman, ignoring my orders?

191
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:48,538
That's not all, my sultan.

192
00:30:49,658 --> 00:30:52,378
The issue is far more critical.

193
00:30:55,138 --> 00:30:57,458
Tell me what you know, Vizier Sadettin.

194
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:00,738
Unfortunately,
Ertuğrul Bey is, once again,

195
00:31:00,978 --> 00:31:03,138
at the center of events, my Sultan.

196
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:06,098
What does it have to do
with Ertuğrul Bey<i>, </i>Sadettin?

197
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:10,098
I guess he was trying to save the Prince

198
00:31:10,738 --> 00:31:15,618
and use him
for the revolt against you, my Sultan.

199
00:31:18,858 --> 00:31:21,258
Altun Aba must have panicked

200
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:23,178
and killed the prince and his mother,

201
00:31:23,538 --> 00:31:25,858
disobeying your orders.

202
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:27,818
Altun Aba paid the price

203
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:30,138
for his crime

204
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:33,938
which was committed because
of his weakness and disloyalty.

205
00:31:36,258 --> 00:31:38,058
Now, it's Ertuğrul's turn, my Sultan.

206
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:43,658
You shouldn't turn a blind eye
to this situation.

207
00:31:44,658 --> 00:31:45,498
Douche.

208
00:31:47,218 --> 00:31:48,378
That's right.

209
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:51,258
Ertuğrul Bey must be punished.

210
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:53,898
We've had enough.

211
00:31:55,178 --> 00:31:56,178
My Sultan,

212
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:57,618
the state has become

213
00:31:57,938 --> 00:31:59,538
-restless.
-Enough!

214
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:07,298
Ertuğrul sent a letter to me, Sadettin.

215
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:09,098
Did he?

216
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:11,698
What does he say, my Sultan?

217
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:21,338
He says

218
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,018
that instead of taking my brother
to Ankara Castle,

219
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:26,978
Altun Aba tried to strangle him
with a rope,

220
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:28,778
that Ertuğrul prevented it,

221
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,458
and while he was fleeing,

222
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:32,258
he stabbed my brother with a dagger

223
00:32:33,138 --> 00:32:35,698
-and then he escaped.
-So, that's how it is.

224
00:32:35,778 --> 00:32:36,778
Yes.

225
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:39,218
Altun Aba murdered them
not because of Ertuğrul,

226
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:42,138
but because of his own decision.

227
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:48,378
And then, he sent my brother's corpse
to the palace with his alps<i>.</i>

228
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:54,778
And I buried his late mother

229
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:57,058
in Ankara Castle.

230
00:32:57,578 --> 00:32:58,938
We are all saddened by this loss.

231
00:32:59,338 --> 00:33:00,418
But I wonder,

232
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:02,858
after all the unfortunate events,

233
00:33:03,338 --> 00:33:06,698
do you still believe Ertuğrul is innocent?

234
00:33:07,938 --> 00:33:10,018
I don't believe it, I know it.

235
00:33:13,178 --> 00:33:15,058
Ertuğrul is loyal to me and the state.

236
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:22,138
You punished Altun Aba
who killed my brother and his mother.

237
00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:27,178
I hope one day you will understand

238
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:29,738
that Ertuğrul cannot be trusted,
my Sultan.

239
00:33:34,898 --> 00:33:37,258
Ertuğrul Bey obeyed my father's orders

240
00:33:37,778 --> 00:33:39,898
and fulfilled my wish.

241
00:33:41,498 --> 00:33:44,698
He risked his own life
to take my brother to Ankara Castle.

242
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:48,778
That's what I believe.

243
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:53,178
Once he gathers the Turkish tribes

244
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:55,458
and comes to Konya with his army,

245
00:33:55,818 --> 00:33:58,418
I'd like to see you
still believing the same thing.

246
00:33:59,218 --> 00:34:00,858
It's not your place...

247
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:05,578
to question my decisions.

248
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,458
I know that the other officials here

249
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:16,378
think just as I do, my Sultan.

250
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:27,298
Blessed Vizier is right, my Sultan.

251
00:34:29,738 --> 00:34:30,738
My Sultan,

252
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:34,298
for the sake of our state,
it'd be better for you

253
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:37,378
to reconsider your decisions.

254
00:34:44,578 --> 00:34:47,738
It's our duty to obey our Sultan.

255
00:34:50,738 --> 00:34:53,778
We did what we could and warned you.

256
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:59,178
May God protect you.

257
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:15,738
My Bey<i>,</i>

258
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:20,098
we discussed the topic
with the other beys<i>.</i>

259
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,138
We think that it's unnecessary to migrate

260
00:35:22,698 --> 00:35:24,298
as it hasn't been long since we settled.

261
00:35:30,018 --> 00:35:32,938
We have been through so much hardship.

262
00:35:34,618 --> 00:35:35,698
Now...

263
00:35:38,098 --> 00:35:40,418
why are you making a big deal
out of this migration?

264
00:35:43,738 --> 00:35:44,738
My Bey<i>.</i>

265
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:48,018
We spilled blood and tears and sweat

266
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:50,058
for these lands.

267
00:35:50,618 --> 00:35:52,618
We think of these lands as our home.

268
00:35:54,058 --> 00:35:56,498
Why would we go to a strange place now?

269
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:00,338
And the mentioned area

270
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:02,738
is so close to the heathens.

271
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:05,898
They will not let us be.

272
00:36:07,218 --> 00:36:08,298
Well, Beys<i>.</i>

273
00:36:09,018 --> 00:36:10,018
<i>Beys.</i>

274
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:11,738
who could stand against us

275
00:36:12,098 --> 00:36:13,618
once the two tribes are united?

276
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:16,858
Who could dare to challenge us

277
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,618
while we are one as a fist?

278
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:24,018
What are you afraid of?

279
00:36:25,218 --> 00:36:27,298
We used to have the state's support.

280
00:36:28,578 --> 00:36:30,818
We were in the state's favor.

281
00:36:31,938 --> 00:36:32,938
Now,

282
00:36:33,098 --> 00:36:35,258
we no longer feel
the support of the state.

283
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:37,698
We can't live happily there, Turgut Bey<i>.</i>

284
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:40,458
My Bey<i>s,</i>

285
00:36:41,018 --> 00:36:42,338
get yourselves together already.

286
00:36:45,138 --> 00:36:47,778
It's not like us to be afraid

287
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:49,138
and keep our heads down.

288
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:53,218
Our path is not one for cowards.

289
00:36:58,378 --> 00:37:00,178
Our late Sultan Alaeddin Keykubat

290
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:02,898
gave Söğüt to Ertuğrul Bey

291
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:04,418
so that we can settle there.

292
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,058
Both Ertuğrul Bey

293
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:09,818
and I

294
00:37:10,058 --> 00:37:11,298
have said our final words.

295
00:37:15,778 --> 00:37:17,178
We will migrate to Söğüt.

296
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:20,178
Don't make it a matter

297
00:37:21,418 --> 00:37:23,058
of discussion any longer.

298
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:42,258
Aslıhan.

299
00:37:43,898 --> 00:37:46,018
You've been through so much.

300
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:48,618
Turgut was going to die

301
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,778
if it wasn't for Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

302
00:37:52,258 --> 00:37:55,978
But we can't give up
just when we experience the difficulties.

303
00:37:58,498 --> 00:37:59,578
Lady Halime,

304
00:38:00,138 --> 00:38:02,098
I am not able to explain the situation.

305
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,298
Or people don't want to understand.

306
00:38:04,898 --> 00:38:07,498
The situation is much tougher than before.

307
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:10,098
We are talking about Vizier Sadettin

308
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:11,778
who controls the state from within.

309
00:38:12,058 --> 00:38:13,618
Why doesn't anybody get that?

310
00:38:15,698 --> 00:38:18,778
Cowards die many times
before they actually die.

311
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:21,338
What we need to do is

312
00:38:21,858 --> 00:38:25,698
to be with our husbands
and to support them.

313
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:27,978
Sister,

314
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:32,298
You talk like you don't know
how evil Sadettin is.

315
00:38:33,618 --> 00:38:35,938
Don't you remember his vendetta
against me and Turgut?

316
00:38:39,498 --> 00:38:40,578
Don't worry.

317
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,298
Our husbands will take care of him,
for sure.

318
00:38:45,618 --> 00:38:48,578
Vizier Sadettin is not an enemy
who fights fairly.

319
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:51,498
That's why it's hard for us to beat him.

320
00:38:52,218 --> 00:38:54,578
He is so relentless that he tried

321
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:56,418
to poison us in our own tent.

322
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,258
If the evil has a plan,

323
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:02,898
then God has a thousand plans.

324
00:39:06,618 --> 00:39:08,258
I understand your concerns.

325
00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:12,058
But if you insist on this attitude,

326
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:16,058
it won't be good for the sake
of both our tribes.

327
00:39:35,858 --> 00:39:37,218
Mother, did you have anything

328
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:39,698
to do with the killing...

329
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:42,058
of the prince and his mother?

330
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:45,858
Apparently, Altun Aba went too far.

331
00:39:48,098 --> 00:39:50,018
And Vizier Sadettin did
what was necessary.

332
00:39:53,178 --> 00:39:54,538
May God forgive their sins.

333
00:40:01,778 --> 00:40:02,938
I asked you a question.

334
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:05,538
Answer me, Mother.

335
00:40:08,298 --> 00:40:09,378
Did you do anything?

336
00:40:11,018 --> 00:40:13,218
Do you know what would have happened

337
00:40:13,938 --> 00:40:15,898
if Ertuğrul had saved Kilicarslan,
my Sultan?

338
00:40:16,938 --> 00:40:19,378
I have my army
and the officials of the state with me.

339
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:22,578
Didn't you say that, Mother?

340
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:23,858
I did.

341
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:28,378
But you know Vizier Sadettin's influence
on the officials of the state.

342
00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:33,338
And, the Turks are about to revolt.

343
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:36,618
It's just a matter of time
before they cause a new headache.

344
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:41,738
Don't you think that would put our state
in a tough situation, son?

345
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:44,138
Answer my question, Mother.

346
00:40:47,538 --> 00:40:50,138
Did you have anything to do
with the killings?

347
00:40:54,338 --> 00:40:58,498
I'd consider myself a failed mother
if I hadn't.

348
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:08,698
If...

349
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:10,858
you weren't my mother...

350
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:13,778
I'd kill you right here.

351
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:19,098
And I wouldn't even hesitate.

352
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:24,458
I am okay to die

353
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:27,138
at your hands, son.

354
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:31,578
Do you think I'd care?

355
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:36,578
I believe I did what was necessary.

356
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:40,658
I don't care about dying.

357
00:41:42,538 --> 00:41:43,538
Do you still think

358
00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:45,538
that Sadettin killed Altun Aba

359
00:41:45,698 --> 00:41:47,698
because of his loyalty, mother?

360
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:52,458
Don't you see you've thrown me
into a difficult position?

361
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,458
I did what I could to ensure your rule.

362
00:41:58,578 --> 00:42:00,218
Now I don't care if I die.

363
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:04,178
What about Sadettin?

364
00:42:04,578 --> 00:42:05,698
What about him?

365
00:42:08,298 --> 00:42:09,778
You three made me the sultan.

366
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:12,578
He killed Altun Aba.

367
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:15,538
Now there is only you.

368
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:20,618
And you are keeping me locked
in my chambers.

369
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:24,498
If you are afraid of him,

370
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:27,418
let me out of my cage.

371
00:42:28,698 --> 00:42:30,698
So that I can keep him under control.

372
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:35,098
Do you still believe
that he'd be loyal to me?

373
00:42:37,778 --> 00:42:40,658
How can I even be sure of your loyalty?

374
00:42:45,258 --> 00:42:48,378
Why would you not be sure
of my loyalty, my Sultan?

375
00:42:49,618 --> 00:42:51,098
You are my son.

376
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,098
As for Sadettin,

377
00:42:55,898 --> 00:42:57,378
he wants to keep you in power.

378
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:58,778
Just like everyone else.

379
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:01,458
He wants to be more powerful.

380
00:43:02,258 --> 00:43:04,018
He wants to be your right hand.

381
00:43:04,938 --> 00:43:08,018
What you should do is control him.

382
00:43:08,298 --> 00:43:10,218
But he is controlling <i>me</i>, mother.

383
00:43:11,178 --> 00:43:13,098
He is playing with me.

384
00:43:14,738 --> 00:43:18,018
Thanks to you, the army and the officials
of the state deeply respect him.

385
00:43:18,578 --> 00:43:19,698
Don't you see that?

386
00:43:21,218 --> 00:43:24,218
You'll do what is necessary
if he goes too far.

387
00:43:24,898 --> 00:43:28,418
You have to get used to the dirty games
of ruling.

388
00:43:30,218 --> 00:43:32,418
Know that I'm on your side until I die.

389
00:43:36,338 --> 00:43:38,898
I will be praying for you
to do the right thing.

390
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:07,938
Ertuğrul.

391
00:44:09,098 --> 00:44:10,898
Günalp is a dangerous man.

392
00:44:11,978 --> 00:44:14,458
He went too far as soon as he arrived.

393
00:44:16,178 --> 00:44:17,218
If it wasn't for you,

394
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,018
he was going to execute our alps and beys<i>.</i>

395
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:24,938
Günalp has good intentions

396
00:44:25,218 --> 00:44:26,778
and he is loyal to the state.

397
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:30,618
But his judgment is clouded.

398
00:44:32,098 --> 00:44:34,498
He is under the spell of Sadettin.

399
00:44:35,658 --> 00:44:39,698
I intend to break that spell
and open his eyes.

400
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:43,418
Ertuğrul.

401
00:44:44,698 --> 00:44:46,898
I know you calculate your moves.

402
00:44:48,138 --> 00:44:49,378
But for God's sake,

403
00:44:50,138 --> 00:44:51,218
please be careful.

404
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:56,458
And...

405
00:44:58,698 --> 00:44:59,778
Lady Aslıhan is skeptical

406
00:45:01,178 --> 00:45:03,218
about migrating to Söğüt.

407
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:06,258
Lady Aslıhan is loyal to us.

408
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:08,418
She is a brave woman.

409
00:45:09,538 --> 00:45:10,538
Why is she skeptical?

410
00:45:12,938 --> 00:45:15,458
She is afraid
of Vizier Sadettin's capabilities.

411
00:45:16,658 --> 00:45:18,218
She thinks

412
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:21,138
now that he is even more powerful,
he can do more to harm us.

413
00:45:22,098 --> 00:45:24,258
She wants everyone to be safe.

414
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:29,178
She has been through so much.

415
00:45:31,378 --> 00:45:32,378
I understand that.

416
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:35,658
It's her duty to think about her tribe.

417
00:45:36,938 --> 00:45:39,498
But she needs to let go of those fears.

418
00:45:41,058 --> 00:45:43,978
And we should help her
to overcome her fears.

419
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:46,778
I'll talk to Lady Aslıhan.

420
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:48,938
That would be great, my Bey<i>.</i>

421
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:22,058
Why are you here?

422
00:46:22,298 --> 00:46:23,498
We are here to take you.

423
00:46:24,218 --> 00:46:25,218
To where?

424
00:46:25,698 --> 00:46:26,738
You'll see.

425
00:46:30,258 --> 00:46:31,498
Alps<i>, </i>calm down.

426
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:33,898
Calm down.

427
00:46:35,138 --> 00:46:39,538
How can you treat a kaledar
of the state like a traitor?

428
00:46:40,778 --> 00:46:41,778
Huh?

429
00:46:42,818 --> 00:46:45,298
I came here of my own will.

430
00:46:45,538 --> 00:46:46,538
Learn some manners.

431
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:51,738
Günalp Bey<i>,</i>

432
00:46:52,698 --> 00:46:55,298
You will see where you are going
when you get there.

433
00:46:57,058 --> 00:46:59,218
Now, don't make it hard for us.

434
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:16,858
Damn you, Ertuğrul!

435
00:47:17,898 --> 00:47:19,178
What happened, blessed Vizier?

436
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:21,178
The letter is from Günalp's aide Aydogmus.

437
00:47:22,418 --> 00:47:24,738
He says Ertuğrul stopped the negotiations,

438
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:27,858
took the Governor to execute him
in his tribe,

439
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,338
and put Günalp in a dungeon.

440
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:33,138
Let's send some troops
to Karacahisar Castle

441
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:35,578
and bury Ertuğrul there.

442
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,698
The Governor will take care of that.

443
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:41,378
Is he still alive?

444
00:47:41,618 --> 00:47:44,218
Ertuğrul's alps were ambushed

445
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:46,018
while taking the Governor,

446
00:47:46,938 --> 00:47:48,578
and Kritos managed to escape.

447
00:47:49,378 --> 00:47:50,378
Alright.

448
00:47:50,978 --> 00:47:52,498
After this incident,

449
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,618
the Sultan won't let Ertuğrul
remain as the Margrave.

450
00:47:56,698 --> 00:47:57,698
What if our Sultan

451
00:47:58,258 --> 00:47:59,738
still supports Ertuğrul,

452
00:48:00,618 --> 00:48:02,538
what will you do, blessed Vizier?

453
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:12,018
Send word to the viziers
and the commanders of the army.

454
00:48:13,138 --> 00:48:15,578
Let them know

455
00:48:16,338 --> 00:48:18,658
that the crucial interests
of the state are at stake

456
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:20,458
because of the stupidity of a sultan.

457
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:23,338
I'll have a meeting with them tonight.

458
00:48:26,218 --> 00:48:28,018
We will release Ertuğrul

459
00:48:28,378 --> 00:48:29,658
from his duties.

460
00:48:33,818 --> 00:48:35,138
Then, I will go

461
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:36,538
to the caravansary

462
00:48:36,858 --> 00:48:39,178
to discuss the fate of demoted Ertuğrul

463
00:48:39,418 --> 00:48:41,658
with the governor Kritos.

464
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:44,458
As you order, blessed Vizier.

465
00:49:09,858 --> 00:49:14,778
Sultan Alaeddin Keykubat
entrusted Söğüt to us.

466
00:49:15,858 --> 00:49:18,098
Söğüt is a gate to a new opportunity

467
00:49:18,778 --> 00:49:19,778
for us

468
00:49:20,218 --> 00:49:21,778
to conquer new lands

469
00:49:22,338 --> 00:49:25,338
and to fight for our cause and the state.

470
00:49:27,618 --> 00:49:29,298
Some wise man said

471
00:49:29,698 --> 00:49:32,578
a rolling stone gathers no moss.

472
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:39,458
I'd prefer to be rolling
rather than have a sedentary lifestyle.

473
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:41,738
From now on,

474
00:49:43,098 --> 00:49:44,258
no matter where the place is,

475
00:49:45,298 --> 00:49:47,458
we'll be fighting for our cause
and conquering new lands.

476
00:49:52,018 --> 00:49:54,658
It's better to keep moving
than to stay in the same place.

477
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:56,658
I hope our new home

478
00:49:57,138 --> 00:49:58,138
brings new joys.

479
00:49:59,418 --> 00:50:00,418
Hopefully so.

480
00:50:00,778 --> 00:50:02,258
-Hopefully so.
-Hopefully so.

481
00:50:05,898 --> 00:50:07,578
What do you think, Lady Aslıhan?

482
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:16,458
My Bey<i>, </i>I have some concerns.

483
00:50:18,738 --> 00:50:20,058
Let us know what they are.

484
00:50:23,138 --> 00:50:26,738
You know best how evil Vizier Sadettin is.

485
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:30,898
Unfortunately, he has the state
within his grasp.

486
00:50:34,218 --> 00:50:36,818
I'm afraid he'll be even more cruel to us.

487
00:50:37,658 --> 00:50:40,138
And, this degenerate man
killed our glorious Sultan,

488
00:50:40,858 --> 00:50:42,178
he can do much worse to us.

489
00:50:46,258 --> 00:50:47,258
Lady Aslıhan.

490
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:51,738
Vizier Sadettin has set so many traps
up till now.

491
00:50:54,978 --> 00:50:58,778
But with God's permission,
we destroyed all his traps.

492
00:51:01,778 --> 00:51:03,098
Each trap of his

493
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:05,658
brought us even closer to each other.

494
00:51:06,178 --> 00:51:07,698
They made us even more powerful.

495
00:51:12,138 --> 00:51:13,138
You know,

496
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:15,658
we have an important purpose.

497
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:18,458
We can't be successful
with fear in our hearts.

498
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:23,378
On the contrary,

499
00:51:23,978 --> 00:51:25,938
the bigger the trouble is,

500
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:28,618
the greater the courage should be.

501
00:51:31,058 --> 00:51:33,218
It's the only way to be successful.

502
00:51:36,938 --> 00:51:37,978
Now, I'm asking you...

503
00:51:39,298 --> 00:51:40,538
What would Aliyar Bey do...

504
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:42,658
if he was here?

505
00:51:50,098 --> 00:51:51,538
My Bey<i>, </i>you have a point,

506
00:51:52,018 --> 00:51:53,618
but what about the beys of Cavdar?

507
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,538
They are against this decision.

508
00:51:57,018 --> 00:51:58,578
I don't want my tribe to be divided.

509
00:52:03,098 --> 00:52:04,098
Lady Aslıhan.

510
00:52:07,218 --> 00:52:10,018
I left my own brothers to pursue the cause
I believed to be right.

511
00:52:12,938 --> 00:52:14,338
My tribe was also divided.

512
00:52:16,058 --> 00:52:17,058
Yet, you see

513
00:52:17,778 --> 00:52:19,418
now I am the Margrave.

514
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:24,978
We've become a hope for the oppressed
and an instrument of the state.

515
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:30,578
Regardless of the pains we endured,

516
00:52:31,298 --> 00:52:34,418
it's obvious that it was the right choice.

517
00:52:36,898 --> 00:52:37,978
You shouldn't be afraid.

518
00:52:39,258 --> 00:52:41,138
Our path is clear.

519
00:52:42,578 --> 00:52:43,578
And it's a tough one.

520
00:52:44,138 --> 00:52:45,138
That's why

521
00:52:45,578 --> 00:52:47,058
those who will possibly turn back

522
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:51,218
shouldn't be on the road
in the first place.

523
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:53,218
What we need is people

524
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:55,258
who are not afraid,

525
00:52:55,898 --> 00:52:58,418
and who have a greater vision.

526
00:53:31,018 --> 00:53:32,858
Tell me what happened.

527
00:53:35,818 --> 00:53:37,138
I'd like you to know

528
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:40,778
that I've protected the reputation

529
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,138
of you and our Sultan
by killing Altun Aba.

530
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:46,818
So, is this great state not able

531
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:50,858
to deal with that bastard, Ertuğrul?

532
00:53:52,578 --> 00:53:53,978
It is, Lady Mahperi.

533
00:53:56,338 --> 00:53:59,978
Ertuğrul needs to be relieved of
his duties as the margrave,

534
00:54:00,218 --> 00:54:01,898
because of his actions against Günalp

535
00:54:02,258 --> 00:54:03,258
and governor Kritos.

536
00:54:04,178 --> 00:54:06,058
I'll do what's necessary.

537
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:08,498
You do what you can, too.

538
00:54:09,058 --> 00:54:10,378
So that

539
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:11,418
we prevent Ertuğrul

540
00:54:11,658 --> 00:54:12,978
from using our Sultan

541
00:54:13,098 --> 00:54:16,138
against us like a sword.

542
00:54:18,178 --> 00:54:19,618
I'll talk to the Sultan.

543
00:54:20,378 --> 00:54:21,378
Alright.

544
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:24,298
Tomorrow, I'll meet with Kritos

545
00:54:24,578 --> 00:54:25,978
in the caravansary.

546
00:54:26,778 --> 00:54:30,978
I have no doubts he will do all he can
to get rid of Ertuğrul.

547
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:34,218
Can you guarantee

548
00:54:35,058 --> 00:54:36,258
that once our Sultan is away,

549
00:54:36,378 --> 00:54:39,458
Governor Kritos won't try to conquer
the Karacahisar Castle,

550
00:54:39,578 --> 00:54:41,218
Vizier Sadettin?

551
00:54:45,058 --> 00:54:46,738
We can't know for sure

552
00:54:46,898 --> 00:54:49,978
whether he'll try to humiliate the Sultan
who was recently enthroned.

553
00:54:50,938 --> 00:54:52,578
Don't worry, Lady Mahperi.

554
00:54:53,258 --> 00:54:55,858
I'll have a spy in his circle,
who will inform me

555
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:57,258
of every step he takes.

556
00:54:57,698 --> 00:54:59,498
That should do it.

557
00:54:59,658 --> 00:55:01,578
If the Governor intends
to humiliate our Sultan,

558
00:55:02,018 --> 00:55:03,458
I'll know.

559
00:55:04,698 --> 00:55:05,698
Very well.

560
00:55:07,018 --> 00:55:08,018
Excuse me.

561
00:55:20,178 --> 00:55:23,018
You'll die with Ertuğrul, Kopek.

562
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,138
I won't let you devour my son.

563
00:56:31,298 --> 00:56:32,298
My Bey<i>,</i>

564
00:56:32,538 --> 00:56:35,658
I might have upset you
because of this migration issue.

565
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:39,738
You know, I have no one but you.

566
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:41,578
I was afraid

567
00:56:42,378 --> 00:56:45,178
to lose you and to divide our tribe.

568
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:54,578
I know, Aslıhan.

569
00:56:54,818 --> 00:56:55,818
I know.

570
00:56:56,778 --> 00:56:58,698
I don't have anyone but you either.

571
00:57:02,978 --> 00:57:04,218
But don't you worry.

572
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:07,298
I think about the tribe more than you do.

573
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:11,898
Hopefully,

574
00:57:12,498 --> 00:57:15,218
we will be happier in Söğüt
than we are here.

575
00:57:16,658 --> 00:57:18,418
The migration will be good for our tribe.

576
00:57:19,378 --> 00:57:20,738
You are my husband.

577
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:22,978
I lost my mother,

578
00:57:23,618 --> 00:57:24,618
father,

579
00:57:24,938 --> 00:57:26,498
and brother, Turgut.

580
00:57:29,138 --> 00:57:30,898
When I saw you on the gallows,

581
00:57:31,498 --> 00:57:33,218
it was excruciating for me.

582
00:57:33,778 --> 00:57:34,978
I couldn't even breathe.

583
00:57:35,778 --> 00:57:38,898
I felt like I was alone in the world.

584
00:57:39,898 --> 00:57:40,898
My Bey<i>,</i>

585
00:57:41,418 --> 00:57:42,738
that was too excruciating for me.

586
00:57:57,178 --> 00:57:58,618
Don't worry anymore.

587
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:00,338
Justice has prevailed.

588
00:58:01,098 --> 00:58:02,098
I'm by your side, now.

589
00:58:05,818 --> 00:58:07,818
And I will always be.

590
00:58:09,978 --> 00:58:13,578
When I think about anything,
I consider both our positions.

591
00:58:14,738 --> 00:58:16,378
It's the same with the migration issue.

592
00:58:19,058 --> 00:58:20,258
Don't you worry.

593
00:58:37,978 --> 00:58:39,138
The Governor of Bilecik

594
00:58:39,618 --> 00:58:41,218
will be waiting to ambush us.

595
00:58:42,658 --> 00:58:43,978
There will be many of them.

596
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,138
We must all stay sharp.

597
00:58:50,698 --> 00:58:51,698
Remember,

598
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:53,458
our first mission is

599
00:58:54,578 --> 00:58:57,018
to clear the passage from the infidels

600
00:58:57,778 --> 00:58:59,458
and then proceed with the migration.

601
00:59:01,018 --> 00:59:02,018
Bamsi.

602
00:59:02,738 --> 00:59:04,418
Are the alps<i>, </i>horses,

603
00:59:04,938 --> 00:59:06,018
and the swords ready?

604
00:59:06,578 --> 00:59:08,978
The alps are strong, the swords are sharp

605
00:59:09,218 --> 00:59:11,218
and the horses are fast, my Bey<i>.</i>

606
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:13,418
Very well.

607
00:59:14,338 --> 00:59:16,178
You will secretly follow the Governor

608
00:59:16,778 --> 00:59:20,178
and ambush him with the alps<i>, </i>Bamsi.

609
00:59:20,538 --> 00:59:21,658
As you order, my Bey<i>.</i>

610
00:59:22,658 --> 00:59:23,658
Brother Sungur.

611
00:59:24,578 --> 00:59:25,578
Turgut.

612
00:59:26,178 --> 00:59:28,578
You'll be fighting close
to me and Günalp Bey<i>.</i>

613
00:59:29,938 --> 00:59:30,938
As you order, my Bey<i>.</i>

614
00:59:31,738 --> 00:59:32,858
As you order, my Bey.

615
00:59:33,978 --> 00:59:34,978
Abdurrahman.

616
00:59:36,018 --> 00:59:37,018
You'll stay in the tribe.

617
00:59:38,178 --> 00:59:39,298
As you order, my Bey.

618
00:59:41,418 --> 00:59:43,058
Our next target is...

619
00:59:43,978 --> 00:59:45,778
Sadettin Kopek.

620
00:59:51,018 --> 00:59:52,578
Sadettin Kopek will die.

621
00:59:53,778 --> 00:59:56,618
We will destroy him and his gang,

622
00:59:57,978 --> 01:00:00,338
and save the state from their grasp.

623
01:00:03,898 --> 01:00:05,418
We will wait for the right moment

624
01:00:06,938 --> 01:00:08,138
and finish him.

625
01:00:11,498 --> 01:00:12,498
What about the Sultan?

626
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:17,338
Sultan Giyaseddin is a smart man

627
01:00:17,618 --> 01:00:20,058
and he can foresee what future problems

628
01:00:20,498 --> 01:00:22,698
he might face.

629
01:00:24,218 --> 01:00:25,338
We will help the Sultan,

630
01:00:25,978 --> 01:00:28,658
and he will help us

631
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:30,458
once Sadettin Kopek

632
01:00:31,178 --> 01:00:33,298
corners him with his gang.

633
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:37,098
And,

634
01:00:37,698 --> 01:00:39,698
we will get rid of Sadettin.

635
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:43,138
What about his mother, Lady Mahperi?

636
01:00:44,258 --> 01:00:47,418
Well, it's Sultan Giyaseddin's issue
and he will take care of her.

637
01:00:50,138 --> 01:00:51,138
Brave men.

638
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:53,898
The road we will be on tomorrow

639
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:57,098
is much longer and tougher than any roads

640
01:00:57,618 --> 01:00:59,018
we've ever taken.

641
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:02,258
We either save the Seljuks

642
01:01:03,018 --> 01:01:05,018
on this road...

643
01:01:06,058 --> 01:01:07,058
or

644
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:08,538
we will sow

645
01:01:08,658 --> 01:01:11,658
the first seeds of a new, holy state.

646
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,538
It's either extinction...

647
01:01:18,858 --> 01:01:20,058
or resurrection.

648
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,138
Our cause is a cause

649
01:01:25,898 --> 01:01:28,858
that might need any kind of sacrifice.

650
01:01:30,698 --> 01:01:32,618
We'd die for your cause, my Bey<i>.</i>

651
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:34,938
I appreciate it.

652
01:01:35,738 --> 01:01:36,738
Much appreciated.

653
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,178
May God help us.

654
01:01:39,618 --> 01:01:40,618
Amen.

655
01:01:45,898 --> 01:01:46,898
Now...

656
01:01:48,258 --> 01:01:49,458
bring Günalp Bey to me.

657
01:02:28,098 --> 01:02:29,098
Who are you?

658
01:02:35,698 --> 01:02:39,378
I'm representing Vizier Sadettin,
the only person who can get you out.

659
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,418
What do you want?

660
01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:47,498
If you are not pregnant,
Artuk Bey will kill you.

661
01:02:49,578 --> 01:02:50,578
If you are pregnant...

662
01:02:51,378 --> 01:02:52,698
he will kill you anyway

663
01:02:53,338 --> 01:02:54,338
once the child is born.

664
01:02:56,178 --> 01:02:57,538
Your fate is obvious, you'll die.

665
01:02:58,738 --> 01:02:59,738
Poor girl.

666
01:03:00,938 --> 01:03:03,458
But if you make an alliance with us...

667
01:03:06,138 --> 01:03:07,818
you can get out of here,

668
01:03:08,978 --> 01:03:10,658
and you can get rich.

669
01:03:24,938 --> 01:03:26,258
What do you want me to do?

670
01:03:31,898 --> 01:03:33,458
We want you to be our spy.

671
01:03:34,618 --> 01:03:37,538
You'll get 100 gold pieces
for any information you provide.

672
01:03:40,018 --> 01:03:41,098
Information about what?

673
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:43,418
Where do you want me
to gather information from?

674
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:45,578
From the Governor of Bilecik.

675
01:03:51,658 --> 01:03:53,658
I'll do what you want.

676
01:03:54,778 --> 01:03:56,458
Just get me out of here.

677
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,538
I knew you were a smart woman, Marya.

678
01:04:03,018 --> 01:04:04,018
Be patient.

679
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:06,578
Vizier Sadettin will get you out of here.

680
01:04:07,978 --> 01:04:11,098
Please send my regards
to Vizier Sadettin.

681
01:04:54,702 --> 01:04:57,782
You wouldn't dare kill me
in front of my soldiers

682
01:04:58,782 --> 01:05:01,142
so you brought me to your pavilion,
Ertuğrul Bey?

683
01:05:26,862 --> 01:05:28,982
I didn't call you here to kill you,

684
01:05:30,422 --> 01:05:33,462
but to make you realize the truth
that you've been blind to.

685
01:05:38,342 --> 01:05:39,702
What do you mean?

686
01:05:50,302 --> 01:05:51,582
You're my guest.

687
01:05:52,662 --> 01:05:55,262
We know how to take care of a guest.

688
01:06:01,622 --> 01:06:03,742
Like how you took care of Tekfur Kritos?

689
01:06:05,142 --> 01:06:07,742
Tekfur Kritos managed to get away from me.

690
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:14,502
But Söğüt is mine.

691
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:23,942
I want to talk to you

692
01:06:24,942 --> 01:06:29,022
about the new place that Kayıs
will immigrate to.

693
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:33,302
Söğüt will be Kayıs' castle.

694
01:06:34,862 --> 01:06:36,662
Since you're my lord in command,

695
01:06:37,182 --> 01:06:40,422
I'd like to make use of your good ideas.

696
01:06:56,542 --> 01:06:59,422
Are you ready for you first duty under
my command, Günalp Bey?

697
01:07:03,702 --> 01:07:05,782
What are you after, Ertuğrul Bey?

698
01:07:09,742 --> 01:07:13,582
You should know that I'm always after
God's path.

699
01:07:16,222 --> 01:07:18,622
Let's see if you are, too.

700
01:07:22,302 --> 01:07:23,942
We'll see about that tomorrow.

701
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:43,342
Our state won't be at peace while our
Sultan is following Ertuğrul

702
01:07:43,622 --> 01:07:45,822
just like his late father did.

703
01:07:46,302 --> 01:07:48,222
What will you do, Sadettin?

704
01:07:48,542 --> 01:07:53,862
Kemalettin Kamyar, Kayır Han,
Hüsamettin Kamyeri are restless,

705
01:07:55,102 --> 01:07:58,462
angry with us.
They've got a very powerful army.

706
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:02,422
We still haven't managed to provide
stability in our state.

707
01:08:03,342 --> 01:08:06,382
These Emirs are committed
to the state first.

708
01:08:08,142 --> 01:08:10,622
After Şehzade Kılıçarslan's death,

709
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:13,782
they won't even dare make a move.

710
01:08:16,502 --> 01:08:20,542
We'll keep them on duty outside of Konya.

711
01:08:21,742 --> 01:08:27,302
But first, tomorrow we'll come together
in Sultan's presence

712
01:08:29,382 --> 01:08:32,542
and take Ertuğrul's Beylic away from him.

713
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:42,262
It's time to teach the limits to this
naive Sultan who

714
01:08:42,662 --> 01:08:45,182
did horrible deeds even to his own mother.

715
01:08:49,662 --> 01:08:51,142
Otherwise,

716
01:08:52,062 --> 01:08:54,582
all of our positions would be
threatened.

717
01:08:57,022 --> 01:09:01,462
If this continues, Kayıs will start ruling
the palace, not Emirs.

718
01:09:02,462 --> 01:09:05,462
I'm afraid Kayıs' and Ertuğrul's reign

719
01:09:05,902 --> 01:09:07,902
will be the end of us.

720
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,782
We won't let this happen.

721
01:09:11,422 --> 01:09:12,422
So,

722
01:09:13,422 --> 01:09:16,462
how will we manage to save the Sultan
from his own ignorance?

723
01:09:17,782 --> 01:09:18,862
Our Sultan wants to

724
01:09:19,262 --> 01:09:21,582
come back with a victory from

725
01:09:22,342 --> 01:09:25,702
his Amid campaign
that his father left unfinished

726
01:09:26,422 --> 01:09:28,142
to prove his monarchy.

727
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:32,462
But he'll learn that he's got nothing...

728
01:09:34,142 --> 01:09:36,262
...if he doesn't have us.

729
01:09:45,622 --> 01:09:47,022
Taceddin Pervane...

730
01:09:48,022 --> 01:09:49,262
...what do you think?

731
01:09:49,902 --> 01:09:52,062
You thought of it very well,
Emir Sadettin.

732
01:09:53,862 --> 01:09:55,862
First we have to finish Ertuğrul off.

733
01:09:57,822 --> 01:09:59,582
Tomorrow we'll put the Sultan
in his place.

734
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:02,622
He'll learn about the supreme
interests of the state.

735
01:10:03,142 --> 01:10:04,462
Yes, he will.

736
01:10:05,782 --> 01:10:06,782
Good.

737
01:10:07,782 --> 01:10:08,982
So tomorrow,

738
01:10:09,302 --> 01:10:12,182
we'll put the Sultan in his place,

739
01:10:12,902 --> 01:10:14,942
and dig Ertuğrul's grave.

740
01:10:38,062 --> 01:10:40,342
-My Halime.
-Welcome, Ertuğrul.

741
01:10:41,062 --> 01:10:42,262
Thank you, my Halime.

742
01:10:44,102 --> 01:10:45,702
I've got things to tell you.

743
01:10:46,062 --> 01:10:47,182
Tell me, Bey.

744
01:10:48,182 --> 01:10:52,022
Tomorrow, with God's help, we will
start the battle for our new home.

745
01:10:54,742 --> 01:10:57,942
If we clean the way before we start
the immigration,

746
01:10:58,382 --> 01:11:00,102
it'll be better for us.

747
01:11:01,422 --> 01:11:03,862
I'd like to get your blessings before
I leave.

748
01:11:05,182 --> 01:11:06,862
Give me your blessings, my Halime.

749
01:11:11,902 --> 01:11:13,342
I give you my blessings.

750
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:15,982
Give me your blessings too.

751
01:11:17,462 --> 01:11:19,062
May your sword stay intact.

752
01:11:20,462 --> 01:11:22,182
May your horse never stumble.

753
01:11:22,982 --> 01:11:24,182
God willing, my Halime.

754
01:11:24,742 --> 01:11:25,822
God willing.

755
01:11:28,662 --> 01:11:30,982
Why are we immigrating to Söğüt, father?

756
01:11:35,902 --> 01:11:38,302
Because it was given to us as
our home, son.

757
01:11:39,502 --> 01:11:42,222
If we don't, the heathens will get it.

758
01:11:43,142 --> 01:11:45,702
We can't give our home
to heathens, father.

759
01:11:47,662 --> 01:11:48,862
Of course not.

760
01:11:50,782 --> 01:11:54,502
Let me tell you a saga of our ancestors.

761
01:11:55,342 --> 01:11:56,342
Come here.

762
01:12:04,622 --> 01:12:06,982
Once upon a time, Turks

763
01:12:07,262 --> 01:12:09,582
lived in a place called Kamlançu

764
01:12:10,062 --> 01:12:12,942
where it was surrounded by brooks.

765
01:12:14,422 --> 01:12:17,542
Turks sent armies all over.

766
01:12:18,262 --> 01:12:20,622
Everyone obeyed them.

767
01:12:22,382 --> 01:12:25,622
They had a huge rock at their home.

768
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:30,062
They called this rock The Holy Mountain.

769
01:12:32,022 --> 01:12:33,622
After five generations, one day

770
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,702
a Khan came to the throne.

771
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:39,382
This Khan married a Chinese princess.

772
01:12:40,502 --> 01:12:43,462
Chinese intented to trick this Khan

773
01:12:43,902 --> 01:12:47,742
through this princess and weaken
the Turks.

774
01:12:49,742 --> 01:12:52,822
So one day, the Chinese got together.

775
01:12:54,222 --> 01:12:56,062
They said, "The amity and

776
01:12:56,462 --> 01:12:57,582
the power of the Turks

777
01:12:57,982 --> 01:13:01,022
comes from a rock that's called
The Holy Mountain."

778
01:13:02,142 --> 01:13:05,062
So they asked for this rock from the Khan.

779
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:09,102
Khan gave it to them without hesitation.

780
01:13:10,462 --> 01:13:12,742
Chinese took the rock,

781
01:13:12,862 --> 01:13:15,582
broke it into pieces and took it home.

782
01:13:16,742 --> 01:13:20,662
After that day, Turks started to go
through some disasters.

783
01:13:21,182 --> 01:13:23,182
The brooks dried out.

784
01:13:23,342 --> 01:13:24,782
The trees died.

785
01:13:24,862 --> 01:13:27,622
A famine took over the Turks' home.

786
01:13:30,262 --> 01:13:33,622
The impulsive Khan died within seven days.

787
01:13:34,102 --> 01:13:36,902
His successors died quickly as well.

788
01:13:37,662 --> 01:13:40,582
Under these circumstances, Turks

789
01:13:40,662 --> 01:13:42,982
woke up one day, hearing the words
of "immigration".

790
01:13:43,742 --> 01:13:48,382
They realized all the animals, trees
and mountains were whimpering

791
01:13:48,942 --> 01:13:51,142
the word "immigration".

792
01:13:52,582 --> 01:13:56,382
Turks started to immigrate by listening
to these divine sounds.

793
01:13:57,102 --> 01:14:01,782
Until they got their amity and
power back.

794
01:14:03,742 --> 01:14:06,942
Have we been immigrating
since that day as well, father?

795
01:14:07,462 --> 01:14:08,462
Yes, son.

796
01:14:09,462 --> 01:14:11,662
We've been immigrating since that day.

797
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:16,382
I hope our amity continues in our
new home, father.

798
01:14:18,182 --> 01:14:19,542
I hope so, son.

799
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:20,942
I hope so.

800
01:14:21,742 --> 01:14:23,862
But you should learn from the saga.

801
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,382
If you give a piece of rock

802
01:14:26,622 --> 01:14:30,982
to your enemy, let alone your home,
disasters will follow us.

803
01:14:32,382 --> 01:14:34,942
We won't leave Söğüt to the enemy.

804
01:14:36,302 --> 01:14:41,102
We'll immigrate and get our amity
and power back, if God permits.

805
01:14:41,462 --> 01:14:43,182
I hope so, father.

806
01:14:43,342 --> 01:14:48,302
When I grow up, I want to go to China
and take that rock back.

807
01:14:48,582 --> 01:14:51,102
I'll take my brothers with you.

808
01:14:51,462 --> 01:14:52,902
Praise be!

809
01:14:55,622 --> 01:14:57,742
Let's wait for your new sibling to arrive.

810
01:14:57,902 --> 01:15:01,862
All of you together will revive our tribe,
if God permits.

811
01:15:02,942 --> 01:15:03,942
God willing.

812
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,422
Come on, go to bed.

813
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:41,622
Aslıhan Hatun,

814
01:16:42,302 --> 01:16:45,462
we've been talking about the immigration
matter with Beys.

815
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:48,142
Everyone is on the same page with us.

816
01:16:49,302 --> 01:16:52,462
No one wants to move the village
to Söğüt.

817
01:16:53,422 --> 01:16:55,342
You're Candar Bey's daughter.

818
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:57,702
You're the Hatun of Çavdar Tribe.

819
01:16:58,502 --> 01:17:01,462
You wanted to marry Turgut Bey,
we were okay with it.

820
01:17:02,502 --> 01:17:05,462
You wanted to make him the Bey,
we were okay with it.

821
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:09,462
But we're not okay with immigrating.

822
01:17:10,142 --> 01:17:12,502
According to traditions, Beys can't decide
by themselves.

823
01:17:12,622 --> 01:17:15,422
If the other Beys say no,
this can't happen.

824
01:17:16,982 --> 01:17:17,982
My Beys,

825
01:17:18,422 --> 01:17:20,422
we are under Ertuğrul Bey's reign now.

826
01:17:21,062 --> 01:17:22,862
We joined our villages.

827
01:17:23,262 --> 01:17:25,222
He is our frontiersman.

828
01:17:26,182 --> 01:17:29,942
Would Ertuğrul Bey take his own people

829
01:17:30,502 --> 01:17:33,062
if this immigration wasn't beneficial
and necessary?

830
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,902
That's not our business, Aslıhan Hatun.

831
01:17:37,942 --> 01:17:40,822
If Ertuğrul Bey thinks this is the right
thing to do for

832
01:17:40,902 --> 01:17:44,182
his people, he can take them away.
But this is our decision.

833
01:17:45,902 --> 01:17:48,502
You can go with your Bey, if you wish.

834
01:17:48,902 --> 01:17:51,982
We'll stay here as Çavdars.

835
01:19:13,142 --> 01:19:14,302
Giddy up!

836
01:19:39,462 --> 01:19:40,582
My Ahmet...

837
01:19:48,942 --> 01:19:51,342
There are important things
that you need to know about.

838
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:52,742
Tell me.

839
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,022
Who's this man, Sungur Bey?

840
01:19:57,182 --> 01:19:59,062
He's a friend of Ertuğrul Bey.

841
01:20:03,182 --> 01:20:04,702
Tekfur Kritos

842
01:20:04,862 --> 01:20:07,982
will be waiting at Söğüt,
just as you predicted.

843
01:20:08,782 --> 01:20:11,222
He's determined to get his son's revenge.

844
01:20:11,782 --> 01:20:13,462
He'll bring along a lot of men.

845
01:20:13,822 --> 01:20:17,262
The horse that Titan brought with him
and Hell Warriors will be there as well.

846
01:20:20,302 --> 01:20:22,942
They'll learn their lesson today, Ahmet.

847
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:26,302
My Bey, there's more to it.

848
01:20:27,302 --> 01:20:29,582
I'd like to be by your side
and make them

849
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:31,742
spit blood during this ambush.

850
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:35,302
However, Tekfur Kritos assigned me
a very important duty.

851
01:20:35,422 --> 01:20:36,982
What is this duty?

852
01:20:37,102 --> 01:20:39,342
Emir Sadettin and Tekfur Kritos agreed to

853
01:20:39,782 --> 01:20:42,062
meet at the caravansary.

854
01:20:42,862 --> 01:20:45,502
They want to co-operate to kill you.

855
01:20:46,822 --> 01:20:48,102
Tekfur Kritos,

856
01:20:48,742 --> 01:20:51,662
wants me to meet Emir Sadettin
as his messenger.

857
01:20:51,782 --> 01:20:53,582
My Bey, if you'd like...

858
01:20:54,742 --> 01:20:56,022
...if you'd let me

859
01:20:56,822 --> 01:20:58,822
I'd like to kill Emir Sadettin.

860
01:21:14,582 --> 01:21:16,902
If you win Sadettin's trust

861
01:21:17,022 --> 01:21:20,942
we'd know about the games both
the Emperor and Sadettin play.

862
01:21:22,382 --> 01:21:23,622
You're right, Bey.

863
01:21:27,302 --> 01:21:28,342
Ahmet.

864
01:21:29,102 --> 01:21:31,422
The grudge Emir Sadettin
holds against you is enormous.

865
01:21:32,422 --> 01:21:33,742
Be cautious.

866
01:21:33,982 --> 01:21:37,382
Don't you worry, Bey.
I'll take care of myself.

867
01:21:37,622 --> 01:21:40,182
May God help you.

868
01:21:40,702 --> 01:21:41,902
Thank you, Bey.

869
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:43,742
Godspeed, my brave man.

870
01:21:48,142 --> 01:21:49,462
Hey!

871
01:22:18,062 --> 01:22:21,182
Sultan Gıyaseddin Keyhüsrev.

872
01:22:47,302 --> 01:22:49,822
Are the preparations for Amid campaign
ready, Cemaleddin?

873
01:22:49,902 --> 01:22:50,902
Our army is ready.

874
01:22:51,022 --> 01:22:54,062
However, we are all worried, my Sultan.

875
01:22:54,262 --> 01:22:55,382
Why do you worry?

876
01:22:55,862 --> 01:22:58,142
As if the Mongolians weren't enough,

877
01:22:58,502 --> 01:23:01,022
now we have to deal with Ertuğrul,
my Sultan.

878
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:02,822
Emir Sadettin,

879
01:23:03,622 --> 01:23:06,702
I don't want to hear one more word
about Ertuğrul.

880
01:23:07,262 --> 01:23:08,782
Do I need to repeat myself?

881
01:23:11,662 --> 01:23:12,822
My Sultan.

882
01:23:15,382 --> 01:23:18,382
There have been some gossips in Konya
about Ertuğrul Bey.

883
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:19,582
What are they saying?

884
01:23:22,022 --> 01:23:23,022
They say you...

885
01:23:23,982 --> 01:23:27,422
...worked together with Ertuğrul Bey
to kill your father.

886
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:28,702
What did you say?

887
01:23:29,942 --> 01:23:31,222
My Sultan...

888
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:34,862
...getting angry at Georgian Zahireddin

889
01:23:35,022 --> 01:23:37,222
won't solve this matter.

890
01:23:38,022 --> 01:23:41,102
Everyone in this council knows that
you have no such

891
01:23:41,382 --> 01:23:43,302
evil in your heart.

892
01:23:44,382 --> 01:23:46,342
Where are you going with this?

893
01:23:49,982 --> 01:23:52,302
There are no more words to say, my Sultan.

894
01:23:53,502 --> 01:23:57,862
Once again, Ertuğrul Bey caused
a lot of trouble for us.

895
01:24:08,022 --> 01:24:09,022
Tell me.

896
01:24:10,622 --> 01:24:15,902
Ertuğrul rejected the peace treaty that
we were going to sign with Tekfur Kritos.

897
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:20,182
As if this wasn't enough,
he attempted to murder Tekfur Kritos.

898
01:24:20,702 --> 01:24:24,622
Moreover, he's keeping Günalp Bey
imprisoned.

899
01:24:24,862 --> 01:24:26,062
Why would he do that?

900
01:24:27,182 --> 01:24:30,902
He's getting ready for a revolt against
your reign, my Sultan.

901
01:24:32,422 --> 01:24:34,422
My Sultan, Emir Sadettin is right.

902
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:36,582
Ertuğrul Bey must be stopped.

903
01:24:37,342 --> 01:24:39,422
This won't end well, my Sultan.

904
01:24:39,582 --> 01:24:40,822
All things considered,

905
01:24:41,382 --> 01:24:45,142
it's not possible to come back with
a victory from the Amid campaign.

906
01:24:48,422 --> 01:24:51,542
My Sultan, we're all worried about you
going on the Amid campaign

907
01:24:51,622 --> 01:24:53,822
with your army, since a troublemaker

908
01:24:53,942 --> 01:24:57,622
like Ertuğrul Bey
is making a fuss on our western borders.

909
01:25:03,542 --> 01:25:06,142
Do you want me to decapitate

910
01:25:06,262 --> 01:25:09,342
Ertuğrul Bey who I trust completely?

911
01:25:11,102 --> 01:25:12,182
No.

912
01:25:13,502 --> 01:25:14,942
I know, my Sultan.

913
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:18,102
The Amid campaign is
very important for you.

914
01:25:18,502 --> 01:25:19,742
This campaign is

915
01:25:20,022 --> 01:25:23,662
very important to prove to the people

916
01:25:24,382 --> 01:25:26,182
that you are a great Sultan.

917
01:25:27,342 --> 01:25:31,382
But we as the council, don't think

918
01:25:32,702 --> 01:25:34,662
it's right to go on Amid campaign

919
01:25:35,302 --> 01:25:38,022
when we have a troublemaker
like Ertuğrul Bey.

920
01:25:53,702 --> 01:25:55,382
So what do you want from me?

921
01:25:56,822 --> 01:25:58,782
Seems like Ertuğrul Bey

922
01:25:59,902 --> 01:26:03,662
doesn't want to give Söğüt that was
assigned as home

923
01:26:03,782 --> 01:26:05,942
by our late Sultan to anyone else.

924
01:26:06,462 --> 01:26:07,462
Fine.

925
01:26:07,622 --> 01:26:09,342
So he can keep Söğüt as home.

926
01:26:09,902 --> 01:26:12,062
Let him serve our government from there.

927
01:26:12,782 --> 01:26:15,742
Let him cheer us up with his conquests.

928
01:26:16,382 --> 01:26:20,142
Let him be the shield for
the threats against our state.

929
01:26:21,422 --> 01:26:25,102
So we can know that the brave Ertuğrul Bey

930
01:26:25,502 --> 01:26:28,142
is protecting our state

931
01:26:28,542 --> 01:26:31,542
as the shield of our western borders.

932
01:26:32,702 --> 01:26:34,422
But not as a frontiersman.

933
01:26:35,782 --> 01:26:40,382
His existence as a frontiersman is
a threat to our state.

934
01:26:42,462 --> 01:26:46,142
Under these circumstances,
we'd like you to take away

935
01:26:46,822 --> 01:26:50,382
his position
and assign Günalp Bey instead.

936
01:26:59,062 --> 01:27:01,862
When you seal the order that I prepared

937
01:27:03,222 --> 01:27:08,782
we'll be ready to go on the Amid campaign
for you.

938
01:27:42,902 --> 01:27:44,102
Sir...

939
01:27:46,022 --> 01:27:47,942
...following your advice...

940
01:27:48,822 --> 01:27:52,102
I'm trying to get to know our Prophet
better and

941
01:27:52,822 --> 01:27:55,862
as I get to know him,
I love this holy man even more.

942
01:27:59,102 --> 01:28:00,342
However,

943
01:28:01,622 --> 01:28:03,462
there are things that
I'm still curious about.

944
01:28:04,742 --> 01:28:07,102
I'd like to ask you if you let me.

945
01:28:07,902 --> 01:28:08,902
Go ahead, son.

946
01:28:11,102 --> 01:28:12,262
Sir.

947
01:28:14,582 --> 01:28:15,702
What is...

948
01:28:18,542 --> 01:28:19,782
...Islam?

949
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:22,262
Islam means devotion, son.

950
01:28:23,342 --> 01:28:25,422
What matter is to submit to God...

951
01:28:26,782 --> 01:28:31,062
...and to lead a life what God wants
and mortify the flesh.

952
01:28:32,222 --> 01:28:36,502
To make our Prophet Muhammad Mustafa
your guide.

953
01:28:37,742 --> 01:28:41,662
Islam is the only religion that covers
all the monotheistic religions, son.

954
01:28:42,622 --> 01:28:45,142
Almighty God commands in Quran,

955
01:28:46,382 --> 01:28:48,382
"The only religion in the eyes of God
is Islam."

956
01:28:49,662 --> 01:28:51,262
In another verse, he commands

957
01:28:51,662 --> 01:28:54,662
"Today, I made your religion perfect,

958
01:28:55,782 --> 01:28:57,702
I completed my blessing for you

959
01:28:58,302 --> 01:29:02,142
and I chose Islam as your religion."

960
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:06,462
Thank God...

961
01:29:07,702 --> 01:29:10,422
...for letting me follow

962
01:29:10,742 --> 01:29:12,542
such a holy religion.

963
01:29:14,142 --> 01:29:15,302
Amen.

964
01:29:17,502 --> 01:29:21,182
May God let me live
this religion properly.

965
01:29:21,862 --> 01:29:23,022
Amen, son.

966
01:29:25,062 --> 01:29:26,342
So, sir...

967
01:29:28,862 --> 01:29:30,702
What am I supposed to do...

968
01:29:31,982 --> 01:29:33,262
...to be a good Muslim?

969
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:35,542
You must be a reliable person.

970
01:29:37,422 --> 01:29:39,622
Our Prophet commands,

971
01:29:41,702 --> 01:29:46,702
"A Muslim is a person who makes people
trust himself by what he says and does."

972
01:29:47,502 --> 01:29:50,102
He made an example by living this life.

973
01:29:51,102 --> 01:29:54,662
That holy person was so reliable that

974
01:29:57,062 --> 01:30:01,342
even polytheists would entrust their
valuables to him.

975
01:30:02,702 --> 01:30:06,942
Before our Prophet immigrated with
Ebubekir, he had some valuables

976
01:30:07,622 --> 01:30:10,222
that he was entrusted with.

977
01:30:12,022 --> 01:30:14,422
Do you know whose valuables
were they, son?

978
01:30:16,062 --> 01:30:18,342
Of those polytheists
who tried to murder him.

979
01:30:20,422 --> 01:30:24,462
And before our Prophet immigrated

980
01:30:24,622 --> 01:30:28,942
he designated Ali to
to deliver their valuables.

981
01:30:30,702 --> 01:30:32,382
Imagine a community

982
01:30:32,502 --> 01:30:34,502
who attempts to murder a man

983
01:30:35,182 --> 01:30:39,622
but also entrust their valuables
to only this man.

984
01:30:41,022 --> 01:30:42,622
That's what...

985
01:30:43,622 --> 01:30:45,582
...being trustworthy means.

986
01:30:48,102 --> 01:30:49,899
There's so much wisdom in this.

987
01:30:50,022 --> 01:30:53,782
We have to follow our Prophet's example
in every case.

988
01:30:55,142 --> 01:30:58,582
We should act like he did as much as
we can.

989
01:31:00,342 --> 01:31:03,302
Only then we can be a good Muslim.

990
01:31:05,142 --> 01:31:09,022
If we start something with a good
intention and make an effort,

991
01:31:09,782 --> 01:31:11,782
God will make up for it.

992
01:31:16,302 --> 01:31:20,102
I'm so lucky to be among the people
of such a holy man.

993
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:22,862
May God let me become one of the
people who try.

994
01:31:22,984 --> 01:31:23,822
Amen.

995
01:31:26,822 --> 01:31:27,982
Sir.

996
01:31:29,022 --> 01:31:31,422
Ertuğrul Bey has given me
an important duty.

997
01:31:32,822 --> 01:31:36,342
Maybe at the end of the journey
that I'm on, comes death.

998
01:31:38,822 --> 01:31:41,502
So, before I go on my way...

999
01:31:42,822 --> 01:31:45,342
...I want you to pray for me.

1000
01:31:46,902 --> 01:31:50,582
Good faith will follow someone who
has good intentions.

1001
01:31:51,342 --> 01:31:55,822
God will be by your side on your
holy case.

1002
01:31:58,862 --> 01:32:01,102
Our prayer are always with you

1003
01:32:02,182 --> 01:32:04,782
and those who fight for God's cause.

1004
01:32:05,782 --> 01:32:06,902
Thank you, sir.

1005
01:32:20,182 --> 01:32:22,502
Godspeed and good luck, son.

1006
01:33:44,462 --> 01:33:45,902
Praise be!

1007
01:33:46,462 --> 01:33:49,582
I have never seen such fertile lands, Bey.

1008
01:33:53,382 --> 01:33:55,182
You kept your promise, Ertuğrul Bey.

1009
01:33:57,822 --> 01:34:00,102
If Gündoğdu was here today,

1010
01:34:01,422 --> 01:34:03,102
he'd be so proud of you.

1011
01:34:03,902 --> 01:34:05,782
I hope we'll see that day, brother.

1012
01:34:06,462 --> 01:34:09,542
I hope Gündoğdu brother and you
will immigrate here as well.

1013
01:34:10,902 --> 01:34:13,742
When I get back, I'll talk about this
with Gündoğdu Bey.

1014
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:16,222
Because I agree with you.

1015
01:34:23,622 --> 01:34:25,342
What do you think, Günalp Bey?

1016
01:34:26,702 --> 01:34:27,982
Good lands.

1017
01:34:29,182 --> 01:34:31,662
A village could live here
and herds would be fed.

1018
01:34:33,382 --> 01:34:35,502
However it's right by the heathens.

1019
01:34:37,382 --> 01:34:39,662
You'll be too busy fighting.

1020
01:34:40,542 --> 01:34:44,102
Especially Tekfur Kritos can't stand
the fact that you'll live here.

1021
01:34:46,462 --> 01:34:48,062
You killed his son.

1022
01:34:49,462 --> 01:34:51,462
You destroyed his reputation
at the castle.

1023
01:34:52,262 --> 01:34:53,942
He'll do anything to get his revenge.

1024
01:34:56,342 --> 01:34:58,702
That's fine.
We're here to see that happen.

1025
01:34:59,782 --> 01:35:01,262
I wanted you to see personally

1026
01:35:01,382 --> 01:35:05,422
that Emir Sadettin who you trust so much
and his men are trying to sign

1027
01:35:05,822 --> 01:35:07,782
a peace treaty with this kind of a man.

1028
01:35:08,582 --> 01:35:09,982
What does that mean?

1029
01:35:13,102 --> 01:35:14,542
Tekfur Kritos

1030
01:35:14,742 --> 01:35:17,422
and Emir Sadettin are allies.

1031
01:35:18,542 --> 01:35:19,542
However,

1032
01:35:20,262 --> 01:35:22,062
this alliance is not about peace,

1033
01:35:22,262 --> 01:35:24,382
but about betrayal to the state.

1034
01:35:26,862 --> 01:35:29,022
Be careful about what you say.

1035
01:35:31,062 --> 01:35:33,662
You'll see soon how bad of a betrayal...

1036
01:35:35,462 --> 01:35:37,102
...we're about to face and how

1037
01:35:37,902 --> 01:35:39,542
unaware you were, Günalp Bey.

1038
01:35:42,342 --> 01:35:43,582
Come on.

1039
01:37:00,262 --> 01:37:02,062
Kayıs entered the valley, sir.

1040
01:37:02,662 --> 01:37:03,742
How many are there?

1041
01:37:04,142 --> 01:37:05,182
Not much.

1042
01:37:05,262 --> 01:37:07,582
Ertuğrul Bey and about ten Alps.

1043
01:37:09,102 --> 01:37:10,742
Easy catch.

1044
01:37:13,142 --> 01:37:16,062
It's the best place for the pasture.
They'd like to feed their herds.

1045
01:37:18,102 --> 01:37:22,022
They'll only feed the coyotes and ravens
with their dead bodies.

1046
01:37:27,582 --> 01:37:28,582
Leon.

1047
01:37:29,382 --> 01:37:30,622
Get back to the castle.

1048
01:37:31,022 --> 01:37:32,542
Get back and protect it.

1049
01:37:32,622 --> 01:37:33,982
Yes, sir.

1050
01:37:44,262 --> 01:37:46,502
It's time for revenge.

1051
01:37:46,702 --> 01:37:49,422
Are you ready to kill the Turks?

1052
01:37:49,542 --> 01:37:52,782
We're ready! Blood, blood, blood!

1053
01:37:52,942 --> 01:37:59,862
Revenge, revenge, revenge!

1054
01:38:04,942 --> 01:38:06,102
Let's go!

1055
01:38:19,302 --> 01:38:22,702
Sadettin convinced Atabey Altun Aba
after he convinced the Sultan.

1056
01:38:22,982 --> 01:38:26,662
He and the Emirs close to him threatened
the Sultan with preventing his campaign.

1057
01:38:28,702 --> 01:38:30,422
Sadettin's intention is

1058
01:38:30,542 --> 01:38:34,462
to kill Ertuğrul and remove the obstacles
in front of him one by one.

1059
01:38:36,302 --> 01:38:38,422
I'm afraid after Ertuğrul dies,

1060
01:38:38,862 --> 01:38:40,862
he'll also kill our Sultan.

1061
01:38:41,382 --> 01:38:43,782
And you'll be the only obstacle left.

1062
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:46,542
I worry that he'll kill you too.

1063
01:38:46,982 --> 01:38:49,782
There's nothing to worry about,
Taceddin Pervane.

1064
01:38:50,302 --> 01:38:51,422
That's the reality.

1065
01:38:53,502 --> 01:38:56,542
You and I are
the next targets of Sadettin.

1066
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:02,662
What we have to do is take measures.

1067
01:39:04,102 --> 01:39:06,222
You have to stop him, Taceddin Pervane.

1068
01:39:07,782 --> 01:39:08,782
How?

1069
01:39:09,062 --> 01:39:10,302
How will I do this?

1070
01:39:12,582 --> 01:39:14,622
You have to do this for

1071
01:39:15,062 --> 01:39:18,102
the soundness of our state and
my son's reign.

1072
01:39:21,862 --> 01:39:24,062
You'll kill Sadettin Köpek!

1073
01:39:26,022 --> 01:39:28,022
Send your men after him right away.

1074
01:39:29,022 --> 01:39:32,222
He'll go to the caravansary
to meet Tekfur Kritos.

1075
01:39:33,102 --> 01:39:34,702
This should end here.

1076
01:39:35,582 --> 01:39:37,462
We can't tolerate it anymore.

1077
01:39:39,102 --> 01:39:40,702
What about Ertuğrul?

1078
01:39:42,102 --> 01:39:43,782
His time will come too.

1079
01:39:44,862 --> 01:39:46,942
But first, Sadettin must die.

1080
01:41:50,982 --> 01:41:53,582
I know Emir Sadettin is
like a father to you.

1081
01:41:55,742 --> 01:41:57,942
That's why you think he never puts
a foot wrong.

1082
01:42:01,582 --> 01:42:04,942
He did everything he could to assign
you as a frontiersman here.

1083
01:42:06,262 --> 01:42:07,742
For now, I could stop him.

1084
01:42:09,102 --> 01:42:10,502
But I know that...

1085
01:42:11,462 --> 01:42:13,302
...he won't give up.

1086
01:42:14,102 --> 01:42:16,542
He'll convince our Sultan to take away
my Beylic

1087
01:42:17,382 --> 01:42:20,262
with any threat he can come up with.

1088
01:42:23,022 --> 01:42:25,182
You don't know Emir Sadettin,
Ertuğrul Bey.

1089
01:42:26,422 --> 01:42:29,022
Even if you were right, he has no reason
to do this.

1090
01:42:29,582 --> 01:42:33,062
You disobeyed the state's order
by breaking the peace treaty.

1091
01:42:34,462 --> 01:42:36,782
You'll cause the end of your Beylic
yourself.

1092
01:42:37,622 --> 01:42:39,662
Give up when it's early on.

1093
01:42:48,274 --> 01:42:52,514
Today, he's asking for the beautiful
land given to us by Sultan Alaeddin.

1094
01:42:53,194 --> 01:42:54,514
He wants Söğüt.

1095
01:42:56,114 --> 01:42:57,914
We know what he'll ask for tomorrow.

1096
01:42:59,394 --> 01:43:00,474
What?

1097
01:43:01,434 --> 01:43:03,954
If I hand Söğüt over
in the negotiations today,

1098
01:43:04,514 --> 01:43:09,554
he'll appoint you tomorrow
to rule over the lands I've conquered.

1099
01:43:12,434 --> 01:43:15,794
His next goal is to see me dead.

1100
01:43:18,474 --> 01:43:20,794
Your rage blinds you, Ertuğrul Bey.

1101
01:43:23,874 --> 01:43:27,234
My rage sharpens my mind, Günalp Bey.

1102
01:43:28,154 --> 01:43:33,794
But blind loyalty
is the truth's greatest enemy.

1103
01:44:39,074 --> 01:44:39,994
Father!

1104
01:44:45,754 --> 01:44:46,794
Father!

1105
01:44:52,674 --> 01:44:53,594
Father!

1106
01:45:03,474 --> 01:45:04,714
Mother!

1107
01:45:06,474 --> 01:45:07,754
Mother!

1108
01:45:09,354 --> 01:45:12,274
Father! No, don't leave me!

1109
01:45:12,754 --> 01:45:13,834
Mother!

1110
01:45:57,074 --> 01:45:58,314
Don't come any closer!

1111
01:46:01,674 --> 01:46:03,994
Are you Günalp,
son of the castle governor, Tayi Bey?

1112
01:46:04,114 --> 01:46:06,954
Murderer! You killed my father!

1113
01:46:07,954 --> 01:46:09,274
I said, stay there.

1114
01:46:13,754 --> 01:46:17,514
Your father, my brave friend Tayi Bey,

1115
01:46:18,874 --> 01:46:20,754
was my blood brother.

1116
01:46:22,194 --> 01:46:23,154
He was my comrade.

1117
01:46:25,154 --> 01:46:28,994
It was the War of the Princes
that killed him, not me.

1118
01:46:29,834 --> 01:46:34,354
Just like your father did,
I fight for Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad, Son.

1119
01:46:42,314 --> 01:46:47,674
It will be my duty to avenge
your brave mother and father.

1120
01:47:58,714 --> 01:47:59,994
Your mother...

1121
01:48:01,274 --> 01:48:02,634
your father...

1122
01:48:03,314 --> 01:48:06,074
and these soldiers will be avenged.

1123
01:48:06,914 --> 01:48:09,594
I'll end this damn War of Princes.

1124
01:48:10,874 --> 01:48:13,714
I'll make you an honorable soldier
and castle governor,

1125
01:48:14,354 --> 01:48:16,234
just like your father.

1126
01:48:34,794 --> 01:48:39,514
When the time comes, you'll serve
Sultan Alaeddin and our country

1127
01:48:40,034 --> 01:48:42,154
just like us.

1128
01:48:58,874 --> 01:49:02,434
-The scum set up an ambush.
-They're the ones being ambushed.

1129
01:49:03,234 --> 01:49:04,634
Time to show us your skills.

1130
01:49:20,474 --> 01:49:22,074
Come on then, you dog!

1131
01:49:52,434 --> 01:49:54,354
The preparations outside
are complete, Eminence.

1132
01:49:56,274 --> 01:49:57,394
Good.

1133
01:49:59,554 --> 01:50:02,594
Where is this governor?
He should be here by now.

1134
01:50:29,554 --> 01:50:33,194
It's good to see you again,
Sadettin Köpek.

1135
01:50:34,674 --> 01:50:35,914
Ares!

1136
01:50:37,114 --> 01:50:39,314
Say the word
and I'll take this bastard's head!

1137
01:50:40,714 --> 01:50:41,834
Stop.

1138
01:50:45,234 --> 01:50:46,474
He's mine.

1139
01:50:59,354 --> 01:51:01,114
What are you doing here?

1140
01:51:03,154 --> 01:51:04,474
Governor Kritos.

1141
01:51:05,834 --> 01:51:08,674
I carry a message from him, Sadettin.

1142
01:51:11,194 --> 01:51:14,994
Once again...
we are united against Ertuğrul.

1143
01:51:20,634 --> 01:51:22,874
How did this governor come to send you?

1144
01:51:23,874 --> 01:51:25,434
Does he not know

1145
01:51:26,074 --> 01:51:30,114
what you did and how you cheated me?

1146
01:51:30,994 --> 01:51:33,474
I saved his life.

1147
01:51:34,834 --> 01:51:38,394
Ertuğrul was going to execute him.

1148
01:51:39,434 --> 01:51:41,074
And I saved his life.

1149
01:51:41,634 --> 01:51:45,034
He trusts me. And so he sent me here.

1150
01:51:45,834 --> 01:51:51,274
Look, I came unarmed.
I have no weapons on me, Sadettin.

1151
01:51:51,794 --> 01:51:53,554
My faith in you brought me here.

1152
01:51:55,554 --> 01:51:57,674
It would do you well to trust me.

1153
01:51:59,594 --> 01:52:00,914
Welcome.

1154
01:52:01,354 --> 01:52:06,034
Since you came here yourself, unafraid,

1155
01:52:07,394 --> 01:52:10,154
you'll be prepared to pay
for what you've done.

1156
01:52:26,274 --> 01:52:27,874
Kill them! Kill all of them!

1157
01:52:29,834 --> 01:52:32,474
Leave Ertuğrul to me.
I want to be the one who takes his head.

1158
01:52:34,514 --> 01:52:35,874
For God!

1159
01:52:35,954 --> 01:52:38,994
For God!

1160
01:52:48,274 --> 01:52:49,594
Where did they come from?

1161
01:52:57,194 --> 01:52:59,354
Ambush! We've been ambushed!

1162
01:55:08,594 --> 01:55:09,594
Thanks, Günalp Bey.

1163
01:55:26,594 --> 01:55:28,234
Protect me! Protect me now!

1164
01:57:01,274 --> 01:57:02,594
Attack! Attack!

1165
01:57:24,874 --> 01:57:28,074
Lead the way. We're not done with you.

1166
01:57:45,514 --> 01:57:48,714
Wait, Sadettin, listen to me.

1167
01:57:49,794 --> 01:57:52,354
Ertuğrul has moved his tribe to Söğüt.

1168
01:57:53,634 --> 01:57:56,754
Kritos is preparing to ambush him.

1169
01:57:58,834 --> 01:58:03,794
Kritos sent me here
to sign the Söğüt Treaty with you.

1170
01:58:06,234 --> 01:58:08,234
We can destroy Ertuğrul together.

1171
01:58:11,354 --> 01:58:13,314
To hell with Ertuğrul!

1172
01:58:14,954 --> 01:58:20,314
You humiliated me
in front of the entire court!

1173
01:58:22,154 --> 01:58:24,674
I was dismissed because of you.

1174
01:58:26,554 --> 01:58:32,514
My favorite servant, Göktuğ,
died because of you.

1175
01:58:35,274 --> 01:58:38,794
You thought I would
forgive you for all this?

1176
01:58:40,754 --> 01:58:43,914
Sadettin, Sadettin. What should I do?

1177
01:58:45,754 --> 01:58:47,634
Should I list everything you did?

1178
01:58:51,514 --> 01:58:55,434
We must forget the past and cooperate.

1179
01:58:56,354 --> 01:59:00,714
Listen to me.
Kritos went to ambush Ertuğrul,

1180
01:59:01,714 --> 01:59:05,114
but he has no chance of succeeding.

1181
01:59:07,354 --> 01:59:10,874
I lost everything because of Ertuğrul.
Everything.

1182
01:59:12,074 --> 01:59:14,194
We have to work together

1183
01:59:14,834 --> 01:59:18,474
if we're to destroy Ertuğrul,
and anyone who comes after him.

1184
01:59:19,954 --> 01:59:21,314
Hell's Warriors,

1185
01:59:22,114 --> 01:59:23,434
they answer to me now.

1186
01:59:31,234 --> 01:59:33,674
So, you hate Ertuğrul.

1187
01:59:36,434 --> 01:59:40,394
And you came here to make an alliance.

1188
01:59:46,274 --> 01:59:48,754
Ertuğrul might have forgiven you.

1189
01:59:50,154 --> 01:59:51,874
So might Alaeddin.

1190
01:59:54,914 --> 01:59:57,314
But I will not.

1191
02:00:01,434 --> 02:00:03,714
Now, you won't get what you hoped for...

1192
02:00:09,354 --> 02:00:11,074
but you'll get what you deserve.

1193
02:00:19,194 --> 02:00:20,914
Time for you to die, Ares.

1194
02:00:30,954 --> 02:00:31,994
Eminence!

1195
02:00:40,994 --> 02:00:42,314
Come on, Günalp Bey.

1196
02:00:43,274 --> 02:00:45,794
Know the devil you've to make peace with.

1197
02:01:04,074 --> 02:01:06,874
-Any martyrs, Dumrul?
-No, thank God, my bey.

1198
02:01:07,794 --> 02:01:08,834
Good.

1199
02:01:10,274 --> 02:01:14,554
Treat the wounded.
Send the critical ones to the castle.

1200
02:01:14,634 --> 02:01:15,714
As you wish, my bey.

1201
02:01:23,594 --> 02:01:26,594
I knew you wanted revenge, Kritos.

1202
02:01:27,354 --> 02:01:29,074
You might have captured me today,

1203
02:01:29,474 --> 02:01:33,354
but the ones that will follow
will avenge me.

1204
02:01:38,474 --> 02:01:43,714
Tell me the terms
of your collaboration with Emir Sadettin.

1205
02:01:45,434 --> 02:01:47,834
That is a peace treaty
between two states, Ertuğrul Bey.

1206
02:01:49,074 --> 02:01:52,674
I won't stand here and listen
to pompous nonsense from a dog like you!

1207
02:01:53,554 --> 02:01:54,554
Tell me,

1208
02:01:55,514 --> 02:02:01,154
why would a state consider giving
another state land as important as Söğüt?

1209
02:02:01,594 --> 02:02:02,594
Tell me!

1210
02:02:04,714 --> 02:02:09,234
What did Emir Sadettin want in return?

1211
02:02:10,314 --> 02:02:11,714
Was it my head?

1212
02:02:18,074 --> 02:02:20,034
Did he want my head? Tell me!

1213
02:02:23,594 --> 02:02:29,154
Both Emir Sadettin and I want nothing more
than to see you dead, Ertuğrul Bey.

1214
02:02:30,514 --> 02:02:32,634
Because you really do deserve to die.

1215
02:02:33,474 --> 02:02:34,754
What about you, Kritos?

1216
02:02:39,954 --> 02:02:42,034
Emir Sadettin wouldn't give Söğüt
to secure the peace,

1217
02:02:42,154 --> 02:02:44,314
but he would give it to secure your death.

1218
02:02:47,594 --> 02:02:50,754
You're only lying about His Eminence
because your life is being threatened.

1219
02:02:58,594 --> 02:02:59,594
You know...

1220
02:03:01,074 --> 02:03:03,914
what will happen
when we settle on these lands, Kritos.

1221
02:03:06,034 --> 02:03:07,314
Make him kneel.

1222
02:03:13,634 --> 02:03:15,074
It doesn't matter who comes,

1223
02:03:16,674 --> 02:03:19,714
Söğüt will be Turkish land!

1224
02:03:21,434 --> 02:03:23,554
Homeland of the Kayis!

1225
02:03:30,234 --> 02:03:31,234
Günalp Bey,

1226
02:03:32,074 --> 02:03:35,714
you heard what Emir Sadettin
has been doing with your own ears.

1227
02:03:43,754 --> 02:03:48,474
Now listen to me, both of you.

1228
02:03:53,554 --> 02:03:58,354
Söğüt is mine by right
and belongs to my tribe!

1229
02:04:08,874 --> 02:04:11,394
No one can take it from us!

1230
02:04:13,914 --> 02:04:17,994
We'll settle here and set down roots.

1231
02:04:19,754 --> 02:04:21,554
Our children will grow up here.

1232
02:04:32,594 --> 02:04:39,234
Now... if you agree to peace on my terms,

1233
02:04:40,274 --> 02:04:42,234
I'll let you live, Kritos.

1234
02:04:44,834 --> 02:04:50,434
Otherwise, I'll hang your head
from the walls of your castle in Bilecik.

1235
02:04:57,034 --> 02:04:58,034
Dumrul.

1236
02:04:59,234 --> 02:05:00,874
Take the governor.
We'll return to the castle.

1237
02:05:11,914 --> 02:05:13,754
Anything to say, Günalp Bey?

1238
02:05:19,154 --> 02:05:21,554
I have no words to say
against your bravery.

1239
02:05:22,594 --> 02:05:25,034
But don't expect me
to believe what I just heard.

1240
02:05:36,434 --> 02:05:38,834
So, you plotted against me?

1241
02:05:40,794 --> 02:05:42,514
I didn't do it, Sadettin.

1242
02:06:24,834 --> 02:06:26,554
Who sent you here?

1243
02:06:27,834 --> 02:06:28,834
Speak!

1244
02:06:58,874 --> 02:07:00,354
You asked for me, my Sultan?

1245
02:07:23,074 --> 02:07:25,554
You made me Emir Sadettin's puppet.

1246
02:07:28,714 --> 02:07:30,794
You killed my father to make me Sultan.

1247
02:07:32,954 --> 02:07:33,954
And now?

1248
02:07:36,594 --> 02:07:40,794
The wretch you conspired with
has made me a prisoner in my own palace.

1249
02:07:42,714 --> 02:07:45,114
I even needed his permission to go to war.

1250
02:07:48,474 --> 02:07:52,394
If we don't kill Emir Sadettin,
he'll kill us.

1251
02:07:53,474 --> 02:07:54,554
How so, Mother?

1252
02:07:58,114 --> 02:07:59,114
How so?

1253
02:08:00,394 --> 02:08:04,034
When my father was dying
in the Kayqubadiyah Palace,

1254
02:08:05,234 --> 02:08:08,874
his trusted emirs,
commanders, followers,

1255
02:08:09,954 --> 02:08:11,034
were all gone.

1256
02:08:12,554 --> 02:08:14,954
They were too scared
to attend my coronation.

1257
02:08:18,394 --> 02:08:22,314
I'm completely alone in this palace.
Can't you see that?

1258
02:08:25,914 --> 02:08:27,674
Ertuğrul Bey was right.

1259
02:08:27,914 --> 02:08:31,394
You asked me for the truth
and I gave it to you.

1260
02:08:32,154 --> 02:08:33,674
I tell the truth.

1261
02:08:33,754 --> 02:08:37,914
You can kill me
or you can search for the truth.

1262
02:08:38,834 --> 02:08:40,074
You decide.

1263
02:08:40,354 --> 02:08:43,314
But if you're careless,

1264
02:08:44,194 --> 02:08:46,994
just like our sultan was
once upon a time,

1265
02:08:47,514 --> 02:08:49,194
our country will suffer.

1266
02:08:54,034 --> 02:08:57,714
Your carelessness will surrender
the country first to Mahperi Hatun

1267
02:08:58,314 --> 02:09:01,514
and Altun Aba, and then to Sadettin.

1268
02:09:03,194 --> 02:09:07,234
You think you're the state,
but suddenly you'll be nothing.

1269
02:09:08,034 --> 02:09:12,874
You'll be nothing more than a paper sultan
who conspired with his father's killers.

1270
02:09:22,154 --> 02:09:24,194
<i>A paper sultan.</i>

1271
02:09:39,314 --> 02:09:40,434
Köpek will die, Son.

1272
02:09:42,154 --> 02:09:43,194
What?

1273
02:09:44,074 --> 02:09:46,354
Taceddin Pervane will kill him.

1274
02:09:47,554 --> 02:09:49,194
He sent his best men.

1275
02:09:50,434 --> 02:09:52,354
He will die.

1276
02:09:55,114 --> 02:09:58,914
What if he can't do it, Mother? What then?

1277
02:10:01,434 --> 02:10:06,234
Then I'll admit
I threw you to the wolves, Son.

1278
02:10:08,474 --> 02:10:11,434
I'll kill him for you myself,
if necessary.

1279
02:10:33,834 --> 02:10:37,114
Who are you, dog? Tell me!

1280
02:10:39,434 --> 02:10:43,114
I know this man.
He works for Emir Taceddin.

1281
02:10:44,554 --> 02:10:45,834
Emir Taceddin?

1282
02:10:46,954 --> 02:10:48,874
Emir Taceddin!

1283
02:10:55,154 --> 02:11:00,154
So, Mahperi Hatun conspired
with Emir Taceddin to kill me.

1284
02:11:15,954 --> 02:11:17,554
What will we do, Eminence?

1285
02:11:17,834 --> 02:11:22,074
We'll show them how a conspiracy is done.

1286
02:11:25,274 --> 02:11:27,354
My name is Sadettin Köpek.

1287
02:11:29,394 --> 02:11:30,994
Nobody conspires against me.

1288
02:11:50,754 --> 02:11:54,794
Now we know who set the trap.

1289
02:11:56,114 --> 02:11:59,434
If I'd wanted to hurt you I would hardly
have stopped him from killing you.

1290
02:12:01,914 --> 02:12:04,674
You still don't trust me, Köpek?

1291
02:12:21,034 --> 02:12:24,034
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

1292
02:12:27,434 --> 02:12:30,674
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

1293
02:12:34,234 --> 02:12:36,874
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

1294
02:12:44,274 --> 02:12:47,394
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

1295
02:12:47,714 --> 02:12:50,594
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

1296
02:12:54,114 --> 02:12:56,754
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

1297
02:13:00,754 --> 02:13:03,394
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

1298
02:13:05,994 --> 02:13:08,314
They don't look like your men, Günalp Bey.

1299
02:13:09,394 --> 02:13:13,354
You're right, Ertuğrul Bey.
They're not my men.

1300
02:13:21,674 --> 02:13:23,074
What's wrong, Artuk Bey?

1301
02:13:24,994 --> 02:13:26,034
Who are they?

1302
02:13:29,914 --> 02:13:31,274
They come from Konya, Ertuğrul Bey.

1303
02:13:32,794 --> 02:13:34,754
The Sultan has issued a decree.

1304
02:13:38,794 --> 02:13:39,954
What decree, Aydoğmus?

1305
02:13:41,154 --> 02:13:43,394
Courier, read it.

1306
02:13:52,914 --> 02:13:55,634
By order of His Highness,
Sultan Gıyaseddin Keyhusrev,

1307
02:13:57,154 --> 02:13:59,874
Karacahisar Castle
and authority as frontier bey

1308
02:13:59,954 --> 02:14:02,434
will be taken from Ertuğrul Bey.

1309
02:14:12,274 --> 02:14:14,074
The new master of Karacahisar Castle

1310
02:14:14,474 --> 02:14:17,474
and the new frontier bey
will be Günalp Bey.

1311
02:14:27,194 --> 02:14:28,474
What did you say?

1312
02:14:30,274 --> 02:14:32,074
Artuk Bey. My bey.

1313
02:14:33,874 --> 02:14:35,354
What is this man saying?

1314
02:14:40,514 --> 02:14:42,314
What do you think you're saying?

1315
02:14:43,394 --> 02:14:47,034
Nobody can take the frontier bey position
from us. That decree is a lie!

1316
02:14:48,234 --> 02:14:51,514
Here is our Sultan's seal. See?

1317
02:14:56,074 --> 02:14:58,154
We won't give up the castle that easily.

1318
02:14:58,714 --> 02:15:01,154
Those who voice
the slightest opposition to the decree

1319
02:15:01,634 --> 02:15:04,594
will be hanged as traitors
against the Sultan.

1320
02:15:13,434 --> 02:15:14,434
Günalp Bey!

1321
02:15:16,674 --> 02:15:20,434
Günalp Bey! You knew about this.
You knew about it all along.

1322
02:15:20,794 --> 02:15:22,954
But know that you won't get away with it.

1323
02:15:23,914 --> 02:15:27,434
Calm down, Bamsi Alp.
I only just learned of it, just like you.

1324
02:15:41,234 --> 02:15:42,274
Bamsi.

1325
02:15:46,914 --> 02:15:48,914
He has nothing to do with this.

1326
02:15:51,954 --> 02:15:53,914
So who does, my bey?

1327
02:15:56,154 --> 02:15:58,394
Emir Sadettin Köpek.

1328
