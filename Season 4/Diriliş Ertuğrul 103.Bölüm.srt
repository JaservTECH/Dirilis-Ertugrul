1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:41,000
episode 103 start after 12:40 min.

2
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:01,423
Aslıhan Hatun, now that we have
cleared your tribe of its traitors,

3
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:05,023
you should stay with the Kayis,
with my mother and Halime Sultan.

4
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:06,503
Tell them,

5
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:12,543
the Cavdar tribe is free of traitors
and that we're heading off to war.

6
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:17,503
And tell Artuk Bey to send the alps
still at the tribe to the siege.

7
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,983
Yes, Ertuğrul Bey.
Blessed be your holy war.

8
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:24,383
-Thank you, Aslıhan Hatun.
-Amen.

9
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:27,903
Come on then, Turgut Bey.

10
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:05,583
Sir, there's still no word from Titan.

11
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:07,783
I'm concerned.

12
00:14:10,143 --> 00:14:12,663
Titan is a great knight, Kostas.

13
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:16,583
He fulfils his duties thoroughly.

14
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:20,023
Nothing can save Ertuğrul from him.

15
00:14:20,703 --> 00:14:23,863
He'll probably return here at night
to avoid making the secret passage known,

16
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:27,183
I expect word of his victory
will come soon.

17
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:31,503
We all keenly await
that blessed word, sir.

18
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:34,903
Still, we should be cautious, Kostas.

19
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:38,903
Don't forget, this castle
is the beating heart of Karacahisar.

20
00:14:39,263 --> 00:14:42,903
If any harm comes to the castle,
Karacahisar falls.

21
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:45,503
Double the number of men on the walls.

22
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:48,223
And reinforce the doors with iron bolts.

23
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:49,983
Yes, sir.

24
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,863
Marya...

25
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:11,423
Why have you left your room?
The doctor said you were to rest.

26
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:16,623
Don't worry, sir. My wound has healed.
I feel much better.

27
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:20,143
I pray for you constantly.

28
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:25,103
I pray that your efforts
are rewarded with victory.

29
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:28,743
Don't worry Marya, victory will be ours.

30
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:31,783
Ertuğrul's death is imminent.

31
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:33,623
That barbaric Turk,

32
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:37,343
who wounded you and attacked my castle,
will get what he deserves.

33
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:39,743
Ertuğrul will die today.

34
00:15:41,903 --> 00:15:42,983
How so?

35
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,303
As they say in Latin,

36
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:48,063
<i>Auribus teneo lupum.</i>

37
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:51,543
Ertuğrul heads into a storm, Marya.

38
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,543
A storm so fierce that

39
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:57,263
both the margrave
and the Turk tribes will be shattered.

40
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,103
Then you'll see how.

41
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,303
Now, go to your room and rest.

42
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:07,023
Tonight, I celebrate my victory with you.

43
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,663
Get ready.

44
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:18,463
As soon as they get off their horses,
we'll take them down.

45
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:13,543
They found the passage! To the horses!

46
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:14,783
Now!

47
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:16,343
God is alive!

48
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:19,263
God is infinite! God is great!

49
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:23,463
God is infinite! God is great!

50
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:29,223
God is infinite!

51
00:18:58,543 --> 00:18:59,663
Bastard!

52
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:40,103
Follow him!

53
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:43,903
Don't let him reach the castle,
dead or alive! Now!

54
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:55,783
Let's capture this castle first.

55
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:58,743
If that arrow doesn't kill you...

56
00:19:59,503 --> 00:20:01,783
you will yet come to your death
by our hands.

57
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:09,863
There.

58
00:22:14,623 --> 00:22:15,703
You go that way.

59
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:20,103
Take that side.

60
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:38,543
You bastard! I'll kill you!

61
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:09,303
I have to get to the castle!

62
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:12,223
I have to get the secret passage closed.

63
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:59,823
I can't believe what that snake did
while we are at war!

64
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:03,583
Ertuğrul Bey is bound to take his head!

65
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:09,023
Let's pray he hasn't hurt
Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut Alp.

66
00:24:09,463 --> 00:24:12,183
Daughter! Daughter.

67
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:17,943
Ertuğrul will get there,
he will save them and the Cavdar tribe.

68
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:22,703
There is nothing we can do but pray.

69
00:24:23,703 --> 00:24:24,943
You're right, Mother.

70
00:24:25,343 --> 00:24:26,743
May I enter, Hayme Hatun?

71
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:28,023
Come in, Artuk Bey.

72
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:33,383
Aslıhan Hatun?

73
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:36,223
-Aslıhan.
-Thank God.

74
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:37,983
Thank you, Hafsa Hatun.

75
00:24:38,903 --> 00:24:40,303
-Aslıhan.
-Sister!

76
00:24:40,743 --> 00:24:42,503
-Welcome!
-Thank you.

77
00:24:44,343 --> 00:24:46,503
-Are you all right?
-I am, thank you.

78
00:24:47,263 --> 00:24:48,383
Mother Hayme.

79
00:24:49,143 --> 00:24:51,023
Welcome, my girl.

80
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:54,823
Thank you.

81
00:24:55,303 --> 00:24:57,103
-You are unhurt?
-I am, Mother Hayme.

82
00:24:57,503 --> 00:24:58,823
Turgut, too?

83
00:24:58,983 --> 00:25:01,303
Turgut is fine, don't worry.

84
00:25:01,903 --> 00:25:04,103
The tribe? What happened?

85
00:25:04,383 --> 00:25:07,663
My tribe is free of traitors
and has been saved.

86
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:09,463
-Good, thank God.
-Thank God.

87
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:12,983
Aslıhan Hatun, I will thank God
a thousand times

88
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:15,103
that you have survived this misfortune.

89
00:25:15,303 --> 00:25:16,863
Thank you, Halime Hatun.

90
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:21,103
Ertuğrul Bey was a godsend.
May God bless him.

91
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:25,503
God willing, we will see good days
now that these evil ones have passed.

92
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:27,103
-God willing.
-God willing.

93
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:28,263
God willing.

94
00:25:28,383 --> 00:25:33,423
Ertuğrul Bey and the alps are riding
to Karacahisar Castle.

95
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:39,583
Artuk Bey, Ertuğrul Bey commands you
to send the tribes' alps to the siege.

96
00:25:40,223 --> 00:25:41,703
As he commands.

97
00:25:45,863 --> 00:25:47,023
That means...

98
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:50,343
there will be more work
for us to do in the tribe.

99
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:53,383
-Hafsa, daughter.
-Yes, Mother Hayme?

100
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:57,263
Send word to the women.
Tell them come to the tent.

101
00:25:58,143 --> 00:26:02,863
I have new duties to give them
to keep the tribe secure and in order.

102
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,183
Your wish is my command.

103
00:26:04,423 --> 00:26:06,823
I'll send the alps to the siege then.

104
00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:09,903
-Excuse me, Hayme Hatun.
-You're excused, Artuk Bey.

105
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,463
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you, Atsiz.

106
00:26:52,503 --> 00:26:54,183
I hope you have good news.

107
00:26:54,783 --> 00:26:57,263
The traitors got
what they asked for, Atsiz.

108
00:26:58,143 --> 00:27:02,303
-Bahadir and his son paid their dues.
-Very good, Ertuğrul Bey.

109
00:27:02,983 --> 00:27:05,983
While we were waiting for you
Titan and three of his men appeared.

110
00:27:06,263 --> 00:27:07,743
We ambushed them.

111
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:11,783
Titan ran. But I hit him with an arrow.

112
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,343
My duty was to stay here
so I didn't chase him.

113
00:27:16,063 --> 00:27:18,943
But I sent two alps after him,
just in case.

114
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:20,623
Well done, Atsiz.

115
00:27:21,023 --> 00:27:23,743
When the castle falls,
their heads will fall, too.

116
00:27:23,983 --> 00:27:25,063
God willing.

117
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,783
We found the secret passage, thank God.

118
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,383
Now we hunt our prey in his cage.

119
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:34,743
Turgut, send word to the beys
who are holding the gates.

120
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:39,263
No man is to leave his post
until we plant our flag.

121
00:27:40,143 --> 00:27:42,663
-Tell them to keep their eyes open.
-As you command, my Bey.

122
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:46,383
This passage is Ares'
only way out of the castle.

123
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:49,663
They'll only use it at night.

124
00:27:50,223 --> 00:27:53,303
Titan would have done the same
if he hadn't been ambushed.

125
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:56,303
Ares won't expect him until nightfall.

126
00:27:56,903 --> 00:27:58,143
What do we do, my Bey?

127
00:27:58,983 --> 00:28:01,543
Ares is hoping to hear
news of my death from Titan.

128
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:04,983
We'll convince them
that I am indeed dead.

129
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:10,263
First, we send word
to the castle that I've been killed.

130
00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:11,943
But Bey,

131
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:16,223
if all the gates are closed,
how will we do that?

132
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:22,463
We'll find a way,
Turgut, we'll find a way.

133
00:28:26,423 --> 00:28:27,503
My Bey,

134
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:31,583
When we came across Titan,
he was carrying this pigeon cage.

135
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:39,903
Good, Atsiz.

136
00:28:40,823 --> 00:28:41,783
Sisters!

137
00:28:42,783 --> 00:28:47,023
Our beys and alps have gone to the siege.

138
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:50,503
From now on...

139
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:55,783
we are responsible
for training and sentry duties.

140
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,063
As you command, Mother Hayme!

141
00:29:00,383 --> 00:29:05,703
Drills and training will be led by
Halime Hatun and Aslıhan Hatun.

142
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:08,543
-Yes, Mother.
-As you command, Mother Hayme!

143
00:29:09,343 --> 00:29:13,023
You must pay particular attention
to the younger girls.

144
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:17,743
Remember, as the twig is bent,
so grows the tree.

145
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:25,863
Hafsa Hatun will be in charge
of the rug house, ointments and food.

146
00:29:26,543 --> 00:29:29,583
-Keep me fully informed.
-As you wish, Mother Hayme.

147
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:31,543
Saray Hatun.

148
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,863
You are in charge of the women
who take on sentry duty.

149
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:39,303
Pick some of the younger, alert women.

150
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:42,823
Check on them day and night
and keep me posted.

151
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:44,623
As you command, Mother Hayme!

152
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:56,343
Sisters, our tribe and our families
are entrusted first to God,

153
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,263
and then to us.

154
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,263
Until the battle is over...

155
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:04,183
keep your sword
by your side day and night.

156
00:30:04,663 --> 00:30:07,663
Come on, now. See to your duties.

157
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:09,983
As you command, Mother Hayme!

158
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:21,383
If that's the way Titan sends messages,
then we'll do the same.

159
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:25,783
Send Ares a message as if from Titan.

160
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:29,663
Tell him Ertuğrul and his alps
were killed in the ambush,

161
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:31,943
and that he'll sneak back into the castle

162
00:30:32,183 --> 00:30:34,263
after finding out what's
happening at the Cavdar tribe.

163
00:30:34,383 --> 00:30:35,943
Leave it to me, my Bey.

164
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:41,423
After you've sent it, tell the alps
surrounding the castle to withdraw.

165
00:30:43,263 --> 00:30:46,063
Once he sees that,
Ares will think he's won

166
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:47,903
and will be careless.

167
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:51,943
And we'll disguise ourselves as Titan and
his soldiers and sneak into the castle.

168
00:30:55,343 --> 00:30:58,703
Ares is in the inner castle,
the heart of Karacahisar.

169
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:02,583
We attack the inner castle first.

170
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:07,423
Once we've captured it,
Karacahisar Castle will fall.

171
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,103
We'll have to kill the soldiers
guarding the passage first.

172
00:31:10,263 --> 00:31:12,703
But we must be quiet,

173
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:16,663
so the soldiers at the other
end don't hear us.

174
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:21,103
If they do, they'll close the passage
on the Karacahisar side.

175
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:24,823
My Bey, I can't wait to see Ares' face

176
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:29,663
when he finds out you're not dead,
but living flesh and blood.

177
00:31:31,343 --> 00:31:34,583
We'll all enjoy seeing his face
when we get there, Bamsi.

178
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:36,463
God willing, my Bey. God willing.

179
00:31:37,143 --> 00:31:41,423
When we're in, we need
to dispose of the archers first.

180
00:31:41,783 --> 00:31:44,263
-That's up to you, Bamsi.
-As you command, my Bey.

181
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:52,983
May God open the way for our conquest
and help us turn these lands into heaven!

182
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:54,263
Amen!

183
00:31:55,223 --> 00:31:57,583
Bamsi, leave some of your best alps here.

184
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,663
They need to keep watch over the passage.

185
00:32:02,143 --> 00:32:04,743
We'll go with the rest of the alps

186
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:07,703
and pray that God
clears a path to our victory.

187
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:09,383
As you command, my Bey.

188
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:11,423
Come on.

189
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:25,343
Sir, the soldiers are eager
for news from Titan.

190
00:32:26,463 --> 00:32:31,463
With Ertuğrul dead, the need to defend is
at an end and we can start our offenses.

191
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:36,303
We will attack the desperate Turks while
they're still reeling from his death.

192
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:38,663
We'll make it clear to the world

193
00:32:39,383 --> 00:32:41,543
that we'll never leave
our lands to these barbarians.

194
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:49,423
Sir, what's next after Ertuğrul's death?

195
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:54,463
We take Hanli bazaar.

196
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:01,383
They've seen their catapults burn
and their alps massacred,

197
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:03,663
then Ertuğrul's death.

198
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:08,103
The Turks will be truly devastated
when we take Hanli Bazaar.

199
00:33:09,623 --> 00:33:12,703
When Titan and his heroic knights
return it will be our turn.

200
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,263
We'll take Hanli bazaar.

201
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:21,303
<i>Allahuekber.</i>

202
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:26,583
<i>Semi'allahu limen hamideh.</i>

203
00:33:27,663 --> 00:33:29,103
<i>Allahuekber.</i>

204
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:36,503
<i>Allahuekber.</i>

205
00:33:38,943 --> 00:33:40,423
<i>Allahuekber.</i>

206
00:33:42,343 --> 00:33:43,663
<i>Allahuekber.</i>

207
00:33:58,743 --> 00:34:00,863
<i>Esselamü aleyküm ve rahmetullah.</i>

208
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:04,183
<i>Esselamü aleyküm ve rahmetullah.</i>

209
00:34:16,703 --> 00:34:21,743
Mighty God who creates all,
who fills our heart with faith.

210
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:28,423
We are here for your sake,
to bring justice to the world.

211
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:30,623
God, bless us with victory.

212
00:34:30,743 --> 00:34:31,663
Amen.

213
00:34:31,743 --> 00:34:36,023
Do not let tyranny defeat us,
do not humiliate us before the oppressed.

214
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:37,263
Amen.

215
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:42,103
-God, give our horses strength.
-Amen.

216
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:46,823
-God, keep our strong swords always sharp.
-Amen.

217
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:51,983
-God, may our faith be our shield.
-Amen.

218
00:34:52,343 --> 00:34:55,903
We send our prayers for our prophet
Mohammad Mustafa's sake.

219
00:34:56,143 --> 00:35:00,383
-God, answer our prayers.
-Amen.

220
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:02,023
<i>El Fatiha.</i>

221
00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:27,023
-May God answer your prayers.
-Amen.

222
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:03,303
Mighty God...

223
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:08,303
save your soldiers
who are willing to give their lives

224
00:37:08,463 --> 00:37:11,583
to protect our holy
empire and these lands.

225
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:16,183
Don't spare the help you give us
in our efforts to destroy the Turks.

226
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:19,223
-Amen
-Amen.

227
00:37:27,023 --> 00:37:31,063
Knights, brave solders of Karacahisar.

228
00:37:31,943 --> 00:37:36,903
You are all brave, heroic soldiers,
blessed by the Father...

229
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:41,223
Son and Holy Ghost.

230
00:37:42,543 --> 00:37:46,783
Today, in another show of courage,
we will finally destroy Ertuğrul,

231
00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:52,503
capture Hanli bazaar
and deal a final, fatal blow to the Turks.

232
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:56,943
Let our cry be "Death to the Turks!"

233
00:37:57,063 --> 00:38:00,623
Death to the Turks!
Death to the Turks! Death to the Turks!

234
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,063
Death to the Turks! Death to the Turks!

235
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:14,143
Our victory will rise
from the blood of the Turks!

236
00:38:15,063 --> 00:38:17,303
Long live the Holy Empire!

237
00:38:17,783 --> 00:38:21,463
Long live the Holy Empire!
Long live Commander Ares!

238
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:24,583
Long live the Holy Empire!
Long live Commander Ares!

239
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:28,023
Long live the Holy Empire!
Long live Commander Ares!

240
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:45,063
Sir, the pigeon came.

241
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:01,983
Who is it from, sir?

242
00:39:03,063 --> 00:39:06,903
Titan. He's killed Ertuğrul, Kostas.

243
00:39:13,623 --> 00:39:15,103
Ertuğrul is dead!

244
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:18,503
Long live the Holy Empire!
Long live Commander Ares!

245
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:21,663
Long live the Holy Empire!
Long live Commander Ares!

246
00:39:42,663 --> 00:39:45,703
Long live Commander Ares!
Long live Commander Ares!

247
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:52,303
Long live Commander Ares!
Long live Commander Ares!

248
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,423
The Turks are withdrawing!

249
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:09,543
Come, Kostas.
I want to see it with my own eyes.

250
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,743
Ertuğrul is dead! Ertuğrul is dead!

251
00:41:00,863 --> 00:41:04,743
Look, Kostas. They are withdrawing
because their bey is dead.

252
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:07,863
Thank God.

253
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:10,983
Titan did a great job again, sir.

254
00:41:12,143 --> 00:41:15,623
Perhaps he'll bring you
Ertuğrul's head tonight.

255
00:41:15,783 --> 00:41:17,943
Titan wrote that he was
heading to the Cavdar tribe.

256
00:41:18,503 --> 00:41:21,623
He'll meet Bahadir there
then return to the castle at nightfall.

257
00:41:57,943 --> 00:41:59,143
My knights!

258
00:42:03,263 --> 00:42:06,743
The brave knight, Titan, killed Ertuğrul.

259
00:42:06,903 --> 00:42:10,263
-Long live Commander Ares!
-The Turks no longer have a leader.

260
00:42:12,423 --> 00:42:16,463
Our victory will now be easier
and bloodier!

261
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:19,423
Long live Commander Ares!
Long live Commander Ares!

262
00:42:19,783 --> 00:42:22,543
Long live Titan,
long live Commander Ares!

263
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:25,463
Long live Titan, long live Commander Ares!

264
00:42:34,823 --> 00:42:37,423
Kostas, prepare a big feast
to be held in the yard.

265
00:42:38,063 --> 00:42:40,583
Let's give Titan a fitting welcome.

266
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:44,023
-The knights deserve some fun, too.
-Yes, sir.

267
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:48,303
Then we get out of this castle
and chop the heads off those broken Turks.

268
00:42:50,623 --> 00:42:53,223
Long live Titan, long live Commander Ares!

269
00:42:53,383 --> 00:42:55,943
Long live Titan, long live Commander Ares!

270
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:05,423
Alps! My lions!

271
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:09,703
Heroes! Brothers!

272
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:12,823
They have their castle walls...

273
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,383
they could build
a towering mountain range

274
00:43:16,503 --> 00:43:17,823
for all it would matter.

275
00:43:18,703 --> 00:43:24,303
As long as our faith burns in our hearts
and noble blood runs through our veins

276
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:28,543
we will sweep them away with our chests.

277
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:33,983
Today is the day.

278
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:41,983
Our battle cries will tear open the skies.

279
00:43:43,063 --> 00:43:48,503
Our swords, sharpened by revenge,
will glide into the enemy's side.

280
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:54,223
We'll hit them so hard
that the sound of our swords

281
00:43:54,783 --> 00:43:58,943
will be heard in Nicaea
and as far as Constantinople.

282
00:44:00,343 --> 00:44:04,703
That viper's nest
will be our enemy's grave.

283
00:44:05,623 --> 00:44:11,823
May our swords be sharp, our battle
blessed and our final victory glorious!

284
00:44:14,143 --> 00:44:15,663
<i>Allahuekber.</i>

285
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:21,583
<i>Allahuekber! Allahuekber! Allahuekber!</i>

286
00:44:30,863 --> 00:44:33,343
<i>God...</i>

287
00:44:38,183 --> 00:44:40,463
Aktolgali, my most loyal companion.

288
00:44:44,423 --> 00:44:48,383
Aktolgali, just like I promised you,

289
00:44:49,663 --> 00:44:53,823
the time has come to hit our enemy
like a lightning bolt.

290
00:45:39,783 --> 00:45:42,383
One, two...

291
00:45:43,223 --> 00:45:45,263
three, four...

292
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,143
five, six...

293
00:45:50,143 --> 00:45:52,783
seven, eight.

294
00:45:53,503 --> 00:45:56,783
One more time, women. One, two...

295
00:45:57,423 --> 00:45:59,863
-Sisters, over here.
-Three, four...

296
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:03,223
five, six...

297
00:46:04,103 --> 00:46:06,463
seven, eight.

298
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,503
One more time. One, two...

299
00:46:11,343 --> 00:46:13,863
three, four...

300
00:46:14,823 --> 00:46:17,303
five, six...

301
00:46:18,263 --> 00:46:20,863
seven, eight.

302
00:46:30,743 --> 00:46:32,823
Well done, Halime Hatun.

303
00:46:35,143 --> 00:46:38,103
Now, practice yourselves.
We'll speed up later.

304
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,743
Women!

305
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:44,623
Women, your sword hand
must be as hard as stone.

306
00:47:45,023 --> 00:47:50,423
If you bend your wrist, the slightest move
will make your sword fall to the ground.

307
00:47:57,343 --> 00:47:58,623
Come on then, women.

308
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,223
My beauties!

309
00:48:08,463 --> 00:48:13,863
My lovely girls,
you are the future of our tribe.

310
00:48:15,343 --> 00:48:20,143
It is you who will advance and prosper
through the work you do now.

311
00:48:21,303 --> 00:48:22,423
Come on, then.

312
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:32,943
One, two, three...

313
00:48:34,023 --> 00:48:38,263
four, five, six...

314
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,200
My Bey, it's finally time to conquer
Karacahisar Castle.

315
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:04,440
If you hadn't brought us here,
we wouldn't have this honor.

316
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,320
-God bless you.
-God bless you, brother.

317
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,640
Together we're a plane tree.

318
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,840
If I am the trunk of the plane tree,
you are the branches.

319
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,240
And our live-giving water is our faith.

320
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,080
What keeps us alive is...

321
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,760
the faith that brought us
all the way out here.

322
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,480
Bey, you said plane tree and it made me
think of the one we planted together.

323
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,520
My God!

324
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,640
May this plane tree embrace the world
with its branches.

325
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,680
May it take root.
It should take root

326
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,320
so our generation can spread your justice
and mercy all over the world.

327
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,720
For this cause,
may the fate of this plane tree

328
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,920
become our fate.

329
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,920
Amen.

330
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,920
When we planted it, I wished
for its roots to take over the world.

331
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,280
We came from Ahlat, Pasinler, Aleppo,

332
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,360
we pressed forward,
right up against the border of Byzantium.

333
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,240
Don't think that borders can hold us back.

334
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,200
There's no doubt about that, my Bey.

335
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,040
When we were kids, all of us would
hunt around the village.

336
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:53,480
You'd go hunting in the hills
in enemy land.

337
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,560
It was obvious then that
borders wouldn't stop you.

338
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,160
Thank you, brother.

339
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:05,400
However, this is nothing like hunting
in enemy land.

340
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,960
This is the toughest battle
we've had to fight yet.

341
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,560
With this battle, not only the doors
of Karacahisar,

342
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,560
but if God permits,

343
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,440
the doors of other countries
will open for us as well.

344
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,760
I hope so, my Bey.

345
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,160
Our mission is to spread
God's justice to the whole world.

346
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,120
And to be the hope of the oppressed,
the fear of the cruel.

347
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:37,160
For this cause, we might become a martyr
or a veteran.

348
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,960
There's nothing we can do
if that is God's desire.

349
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,840
Yes, my Bey.

350
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,960
I don't know if <i>Shahada</i> is in my destiny,

351
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,520
but if the sacred adversary
is coming for me in this battle,

352
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,680
I entrust you with both Aslıhan Hatun
and the Cavdar Tribe.

353
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,840
Of course, my brave man.

354
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,240
We've come all this way together.

355
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,960
We went through
so many struggles together.

356
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,800
Maybe it's not our fate
to see each other again.

357
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,600
So let's hug.
Give each other our blessings.

358
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,160
My brothers.

359
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,240
-I give my blessings.
-I give my blessings.

360
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,280
-I give my blessings.
-Thank you.

361
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,960
The sun is about to go down.

362
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,080
It's time to attack the enemy
in their lodge.

363
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,720
Come on, my brave men. Come on.

364
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,400
Fill it up. Come on, fill it up!

365
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,920
Come on, let's dance!

366
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,880
Let's dance!

367
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,640
Bring it over.

368
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,800
Come on, Commander Kostas.
This is your victory.

369
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,680
-Let go of my arm, woman.
-Come on.

370
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,240
-Welcome, Titan.
-Thank you.

371
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,320
<i>Soldiers! Commander Ares!</i>

372
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,800
My dear God!

373
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,160
I'm grateful to you
for this victorious day.

374
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,560
Amen.

375
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,000
Marya.

376
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,800
What's that sound, Ares?

377
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,640
I told you, Marya.

378
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,680
I told you that victory would be mine.

379
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,080
Ertuğrul is dead.

380
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,280
I avenged your brother.

381
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,600
What you're hearing is the feast I'm
throwing for Titan and my victory, Marya.

382
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,040
Come on, get ready. Join us.

383
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,560
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

384
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,160
Out of happiness.

385
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,680
It's your victory day.

386
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,000
Come on, Marya. Get ready.

387
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,320
You'll join us in the feast.

388
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,440
Tonight, I'll announce
in front of everyone

389
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,440
that you're to be my wife.

390
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:07,960
I...

391
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,240
Go, herald the coming of Titan, Dumrul.

392
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,760
Your wish is my command, Bey.

393
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,080
The great Titan
and our heroic soldiers are coming!

394
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,400
The great Titan
and our heroic soldiers are coming!

395
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,000
-Welcome! Ertuğrul is dead.
-Titan is coming!

396
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,880
Victory will be ours. Welcome, Titan.

397
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,720
Come on, let's dance!

398
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:58,960
Long live Commander Ares!

399
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:04,720
Long live Commander Ares!

400
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,440
Long live Commander Ares!

401
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,560
Long live Commander Ares!

402
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,040
Titan is still not here, Kostas.

403
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,400
Sir, you know more than I do
how cautious he is.

404
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,960
He doesn't want them to learn where
the passage is.

405
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,240
Even though the Turks lifted the siege,
they will still be on the safe side.

406
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,800
That's right, Kostas.

407
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,560
Give out more wine.
Today is our victory day.

408
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,840
Sir, the places for you and Marya are set.
Please go ahead.

409
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,200
The noise is coming from the yard.
They are celebrating Titan's victory.

410
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,600
That degenerate is celebrating
your death a second time, Bey.

411
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,920
Let them eat and drink, Bey.

412
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:04,040
Let them eat until we crack them open
with our weapons.

413
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,200
Dumrul.

414
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,600
Go to the yard right away.

415
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,960
Herald the coming of Titan
and his soldiers.

416
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,880
Let them welcome us as we deserve.

417
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,560
Your wish is my command, Bey.

418
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,480
It's the day of conquest, brothers.
My brave men!

419
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:31,000
May God not lack the faith in our hearts,
and the strength in our arms.

420
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,760
Amen.

421
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,360
-Amen, my Bey.
-Come on.

422
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,520
<i>Ares, I will kill you with my own hands.</i>

423
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,560
<i>I'll will avenge my brother.</i>

424
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,360
Kostas!

425
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,240
Marya is still not here.

426
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,320
I'm sending a soldier right away, sir.

427
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,600
Great Titan and
our hero soldiers are coming!

428
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,680
Titan is coming!

429
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,960
Great Titan and
our hero soldiers are coming!

430
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,720
-Thank God.
-Titan and our hero...

431
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,640
Kostas, let's welcome the hero Titan
and our soldiers properly.

432
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,320
Yes, sir.

433
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:45,280
Long live Titan! Long live Ares!

434
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,400
My dear friend Titan...

435
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,720
you came back with a big victory.

436
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,000
You buried Ertuğrul's carcass
in this holy land.

437
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,920
May God accept you in heaven.

438
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,120
With this victory,
you have earned admiration.

439
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,080
Not only mine, but all the empire.

440
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,480
My dear friend, get up.

441
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,240
Let me hug you, Titan.

442
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,600
I'm not Titan.

443
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,040
I am Suleyman Shah's son, Ertuğrul.

444
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,160
Ertuğrul!

445
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,760
-God is one!
-God is one!

446
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,720
It's a trap! Kill them all!

447
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,080
God is one!

448
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,160
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

449
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,480
My God!

450
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,040
Hit them! <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

451
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,520
God!

452
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,520
-Alps!
-God is one!

453
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,000
Alps, don't leave our Bey alone!

454
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,360
Don't let anyone pass, fight to the death!

455
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,880
-I'll come back for you, Ertuğrul.
-Ertuğrul is here!

456
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,000
Where are you?

457
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,080
So you're here, huh?

458
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,120
-What's wrong?
-Turks are in the castle.

459
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,000
-What?
-Ertuğrul is alive. Hide.

460
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,280
Marya!

461
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,680
Come with me now. We need
to get out of the castle. I'll save you.

462
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,760
Go to hell, Ares!

463
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,400
You vulgar woman! Traitor!

464
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,160
I'll kill you!

465
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,120
Don't run away, come here!

466
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:53,200
We didn't do anything. We're innocent!

467
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:10,920
We're innocent! Save us!

468
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,560
-We're innocent!
-Don't be scared.

469
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,240
Don't be scared. You're free now.

470
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:39,840
Go see your families and children.
You're free now.

471
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:46,120
May God protect you.
We're grateful to you.

472
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,400
-We're grateful to you.
-Thank God.

473
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,560
May God protect you.

474
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:54,200
Thank you. Come on!
You're free now, come on.

475
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,200
Come on, praise be!

476
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,720
Brothers, search everywhere.
Make sure there are no soldiers.

477
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,960
Come on, let's be quick. Come on.

478
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,400
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>I'll get out of this castle alive.</i>

479
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,440
<i>I can only get out as a dead man.</i>

480
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,040
Bamsi.

481
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,240
We are responsible for the lives
of these soldiers.

482
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,600
Lock them up until we secure the castle.

483
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,680
Yes, Bey.

484
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:14,720
Come on. Come on.

485
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:29,880
Ertuğrul Bey.

486
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,040
What's going to happen
to the degenerate Ares?

487
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,600
I injured him.

488
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,480
I was about to take his life
but the soldiers showed up.

489
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,760
He turned tail and ran away like a dog.

490
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:47,640
The Alps are after him. At least we made
his castle collapse upon him.

491
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,840
Sooner or later the Alps will get him.

492
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,080
Günküt, Abdurrahman.

493
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:58,160
Search the castle inch by inch.
Bring him to me, dead or alive.

494
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,640
-Your wish is my command.
-Your wish is my command.

495
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:01,560
Go.

496
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,800
My Bey.

497
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,960
What's going on inside the castle, Bamsi?

498
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,840
We haven't left any heathens.

499
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:38,160
The castle is under our command now,
my Bey.

500
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,040
Thank you, Bamsi.

501
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:46,920
Let's fetch our flags. The other villages
should know about our victory.

502
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,440
Your wish is my command, my Bey.

503
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,400
Degenerate scumbag, where are you?

504
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,000
In the name of God.

505
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,640
My God!

506
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,680
Thank God. Thank heaven.

507
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,840
Thank God, brother.
God let us take this holy victory.

508
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,160
Thank God, brother.

509
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,160
If God permits, we'll see many victories.

510
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,520
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

511
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,960
Long live Ertuğrul Bey!

512
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:36,960
Our holy flag, that has justice
in every inch,

513
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:43,680
has been honored here
with the permission and mercy of God.

514
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:53,360
This is not an end,
but actually a beginning.

515
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,840
We planted a seed here today.

516
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:02,040
This seed will sprout and become

517
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:06,160
a plane tree that will cover
the whole world in its shade.

518
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:18,440
Let's announce our conquest
with the prayer of Muhammad.

519
01:29:05,749 --> 01:29:08,909
Mother, all the women are at their posts.

520
01:29:09,309 --> 01:29:11,909
They keep patrolling day and night.

521
01:29:12,069 --> 01:29:13,069
Great.

522
01:29:15,229 --> 01:29:16,109
Dear.

523
01:29:16,389 --> 01:29:18,149
You couldn't sleep a wink last night.

524
01:29:18,989 --> 01:29:20,789
Come, rest for a while.

525
01:29:31,069 --> 01:29:32,069
Mother.

526
01:29:33,949 --> 01:29:36,629
There's still no news from Ertuğrul.

527
01:29:36,869 --> 01:29:39,789
I can't help but worry about them.

528
01:29:41,749 --> 01:29:42,749
Dear.

529
01:29:43,149 --> 01:29:45,829
Our duty is to protect the camp,

530
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:50,029
and pray for their victory.

531
01:29:50,749 --> 01:29:53,069
God will surely help them.

532
01:29:53,989 --> 01:29:54,989
I hope so.

533
01:29:55,269 --> 01:29:56,269
I hope so.

534
01:29:58,549 --> 01:30:00,389
<i>May I enter, Hayme Hatun?</i>

535
01:30:00,549 --> 01:30:03,389
I hope to God that it's good news.

536
01:30:04,309 --> 01:30:05,549
Come in, Artuk Bey.

537
01:30:14,549 --> 01:30:16,829
There's news from Ertuğrul Bey.

538
01:30:17,469 --> 01:30:20,869
Thank God.
They raised our flag at the castle.

539
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:24,669
-The adhan has been pronounced.
-O God, blessed be.

540
01:30:24,789 --> 01:30:26,189
Thank God.

541
01:30:26,509 --> 01:30:28,789
-Thank God.
-Blessed be.

542
01:30:28,949 --> 01:30:31,269
Thank God for granting us victory.

543
01:30:32,949 --> 01:30:35,509
This is what you get for capturing me.

544
01:30:35,789 --> 01:30:38,269
My father showed them
and took their fortress.

545
01:30:38,469 --> 01:30:41,149
Next time, I'll go there as Gündüz,

546
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:44,229
son of Ertuğrul Bey, and not as a captive.

547
01:30:45,949 --> 01:30:47,069
God bless!

548
01:30:47,669 --> 01:30:49,869
Ertuğrul Bey expects me at the fortress.

549
01:30:50,109 --> 01:30:52,429
You give this good news to our people

550
01:30:52,869 --> 01:30:55,189
and come to the fortress with our men.

551
01:30:57,669 --> 01:30:58,669
Artuk Bey.

552
01:30:59,269 --> 01:31:01,989
Is Marya all right? I'm worried about her.

553
01:31:02,389 --> 01:31:03,709
Who is Marya, Gündüz?

554
01:31:04,109 --> 01:31:05,109
Artuk Bey.

555
01:31:05,829 --> 01:31:07,629
Marya is a woman from the fortress.

556
01:31:08,389 --> 01:31:11,309
Apparently, she helped Gündüz
when he was captured.

557
01:31:13,749 --> 01:31:16,349
All right, Gündüz.
I'll find out when I'm there.

558
01:32:30,149 --> 01:32:31,149
Come on.

559
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:45,509
Take them away.

560
01:33:33,949 --> 01:33:37,749
You are forgetting that this land
still belongs to us, Ertuğrul Bey.

561
01:33:42,189 --> 01:33:47,069
I know that you're paying taxes
to our Sultan to hold this fortress.

562
01:33:47,749 --> 01:33:51,549
I'm still the ruler of this land,
Ertuğrul Bey.

563
01:33:56,909 --> 01:33:59,949
This fortress was home to a great deal

564
01:34:00,749 --> 01:34:03,949
of treachery, traps, and evil.

565
01:34:07,309 --> 01:34:11,629
Their cruelty could only be redeemed
with their blood.

566
01:34:15,509 --> 01:34:18,669
Thank God,
the light of justice will shine

567
01:34:19,109 --> 01:34:21,789
now that we have defeated
their evil darkness.

568
01:34:22,549 --> 01:34:26,349
With this blow to Karacahisar,
not only will you shake Nicaea,

569
01:34:26,789 --> 01:34:28,509
but even Constantinople.

570
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:33,949
You said this conquest would lead
to bigger conquests, sir.

571
01:34:34,269 --> 01:34:36,389
Now I see what you meant.

572
01:34:36,949 --> 01:34:39,309
I always said no borders
could contain you, sir.

573
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:42,029
Now, the whole world will see that.

574
01:34:43,749 --> 01:34:45,149
Thank you, brothers.

575
01:34:46,869 --> 01:34:49,149
Make sure our soldiers are alert.

576
01:34:50,229 --> 01:34:53,149
We need to be careful
until things settle down.

577
01:34:53,429 --> 01:34:55,069
Search around the fortress.

578
01:34:55,549 --> 01:34:57,149
Let's see what's here.

579
01:34:57,389 --> 01:34:59,069
-You got it.
-Right on.

580
01:35:30,029 --> 01:35:30,869
Sir.

581
01:35:31,989 --> 01:35:34,189
There's a locked chest here.

582
01:35:34,509 --> 01:35:35,789
Bring it here, Bamsı.

583
01:35:36,149 --> 01:35:37,149
All right, sir.

584
01:35:38,869 --> 01:35:39,989
Turgut!

585
01:35:40,909 --> 01:35:42,749
Let me help, brother.

586
01:35:43,909 --> 01:35:45,189
Here we go!

587
01:35:54,189 --> 01:35:55,269
There it is, sir.

588
01:35:56,509 --> 01:35:59,629
Is this that one-eyed governor's
treasure or something?

589
01:36:02,629 --> 01:36:03,589
Turgut.

590
01:36:09,069 --> 01:36:10,709
Here we go!

591
01:36:25,789 --> 01:36:27,069
It's my azure sword!

592
01:36:37,589 --> 01:36:39,749
So, that one-eyed governor's been
holding onto it.

593
01:36:39,869 --> 01:36:42,989
It was that very azure sword
that welcomed you here, Ertuğrul Bey.

594
01:36:43,309 --> 01:36:46,229
That bastard must have even been afraid
of your sword.

595
01:36:46,749 --> 01:36:48,429
That's why he locked it in a chest.

596
01:36:51,349 --> 01:36:52,749
God bless.

597
01:36:54,109 --> 01:36:55,109
It seems that...

598
01:36:56,109 --> 01:36:58,709
he dreamed about killing me
with my own sword.

599
01:36:58,989 --> 01:37:02,509
However, I turned those dreams
into a nightmare.

600
01:37:03,069 --> 01:37:05,869
Now, as traditions dictates,

601
01:37:07,109 --> 01:37:08,949
I'll saber the throne.

602
01:37:36,669 --> 01:37:40,549
The cruel will eventually pay their sins.
Justice will prevail.

603
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:45,189
God is here, and the heathens are gone.

604
01:38:05,589 --> 01:38:08,509
<i>This won't end here.</i>
<i>I'll come back.</i>

605
01:38:08,789 --> 01:38:12,189
<i>I'll take both your life</i>
<i>and your fortress, Ertuğrul.</i>

606
01:38:30,789 --> 01:38:32,789
How is the situation out there, Dumrul?

607
01:38:32,909 --> 01:38:36,589
We sent the bodies of Ares' soldiers
to be buried, sir.

608
01:38:36,789 --> 01:38:39,109
And we'll gather our martyrs
to send them to the camp.

609
01:38:39,909 --> 01:38:42,709
We fought long and hard for this.

610
01:38:44,509 --> 01:38:46,429
If we have a home now,

611
01:38:47,149 --> 01:38:49,389
it's thanks to the martyrs.

612
01:38:52,029 --> 01:38:55,669
God bless their souls.

613
01:38:56,309 --> 01:38:57,989
-Amen.
-Amen.

614
01:38:58,109 --> 01:38:59,109
Amen.

615
01:39:00,629 --> 01:39:01,789
We conquered the fortress.

616
01:39:02,589 --> 01:39:04,949
But we must be cautious.

617
01:39:05,549 --> 01:39:07,469
The emperor could have sent an army.

618
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:09,709
Bamsı.

619
01:39:10,229 --> 01:39:12,429
Tell the soldiers outside the fortress

620
01:39:13,149 --> 01:39:16,749
that they shall stay put
and wait for my orders.

621
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:19,909
The Governor of Bilecik may send a unit.

622
01:39:20,189 --> 01:39:22,949
Have some men stationed
at the roads from Bilecik.

623
01:39:23,069 --> 01:39:24,549
As you wish, sir.

624
01:39:33,349 --> 01:39:34,669
Did you find Ares?

625
01:39:35,349 --> 01:39:36,669
Not yet, sir.

626
01:39:37,029 --> 01:39:38,989
Our men are still looking for him.

627
01:39:40,429 --> 01:39:44,429
Dumrul, warn the soldiers burying
Ares' soldiers.

628
01:39:45,629 --> 01:39:46,629
Atsız.

629
01:39:47,229 --> 01:39:48,669
Take some men with you.

630
01:39:49,029 --> 01:39:51,789
It's possible that Ares got out
of the fortress.

631
01:39:52,189 --> 01:39:54,069
If he managed to get away,

632
01:39:54,549 --> 01:39:56,269
he'll make for the Governor of Bilecik.

633
01:39:56,349 --> 01:39:58,189
Be on the lookout, now.

634
01:39:58,429 --> 01:40:00,029
Leave it to me, sir.

635
01:40:00,349 --> 01:40:02,269
I know all the ways Ares can take.

636
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:05,229
I'll breathe down his neck
and bring him to you.

637
01:40:06,269 --> 01:40:07,269
Thank you.

638
01:40:07,909 --> 01:40:10,869
Günkut, send for the priests.

639
01:40:11,429 --> 01:40:15,829
They should take their paintings
and crosses to their church.

640
01:40:16,309 --> 01:40:17,429
As you wish, sir.

641
01:40:18,469 --> 01:40:19,309
Go on.

642
01:40:57,309 --> 01:40:58,349
Ho!

643
01:40:59,589 --> 01:41:01,189
Give me a hand here.

644
01:41:40,789 --> 01:41:41,669
Ho!

645
01:41:54,509 --> 01:41:56,229
-What happened here?
-Ares...

646
01:41:56,589 --> 01:41:59,349
He got away. He was hidden
among the bodies.

647
01:42:00,029 --> 01:42:03,269
Let Ertuğrul Bey know.
We'll go after Ares. Hurry!

648
01:42:05,269 --> 01:42:06,269
Ho!

649
01:42:42,869 --> 01:42:47,469
Ertuğrul Bey, the Christian people
are worried about their faith.

650
01:42:47,829 --> 01:42:50,509
We'd like to know
how you'll proceed with it.

651
01:42:53,309 --> 01:42:56,909
We won't meddle in anyone's faith, priest.

652
01:42:57,509 --> 01:43:00,629
We rule our subjects with justice.

653
01:43:01,349 --> 01:43:03,869
You are my people now.

654
01:43:05,509 --> 01:43:08,109
God says in his holy book that

655
01:43:08,589 --> 01:43:10,949
there'll be no forcing in religion.

656
01:43:11,949 --> 01:43:16,749
That's why
as long as you don't disturb others,

657
01:43:17,109 --> 01:43:21,789
you may live and pray as you like.

658
01:43:23,829 --> 01:43:27,069
Now, toll the bells,
and gather everyone in the courtyard.

659
01:43:27,549 --> 01:43:28,869
I have things to tell them.

660
01:43:29,189 --> 01:43:30,709
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.

661
01:43:33,589 --> 01:43:34,589
Let's go.

662
01:43:35,749 --> 01:43:36,749
Take everything.

663
01:43:38,589 --> 01:43:39,589
Come on.

664
01:44:24,829 --> 01:44:25,829
Ho!

665
01:44:56,309 --> 01:44:57,829
Ho!

666
01:45:01,749 --> 01:45:03,269
Get down, check his tracks.

667
01:45:17,629 --> 01:45:19,869
-They went this way.
-That road lets to Bilecik.

668
01:45:20,509 --> 01:45:22,189
Ertuğrul Bey was right.

669
01:45:22,829 --> 01:45:25,709
He'll seek help from the Governor
of Bilecik and gather an army.

670
01:45:26,029 --> 01:45:28,669
We must catch him.
On your horses! Come on!

671
01:46:06,469 --> 01:46:07,429
Sir.

672
01:46:09,589 --> 01:46:11,589
Thank God for letting us see this day.

673
01:46:11,829 --> 01:46:13,989
May our victory be everlasting.

674
01:46:14,069 --> 01:46:15,309
Amen, Artuk Bey.

675
01:46:15,869 --> 01:46:18,629
Thank God for letting us see this day.

676
01:46:21,709 --> 01:46:22,749
Turgut Alp.

677
01:46:26,629 --> 01:46:29,309
May God give strength to your arm.

678
01:46:29,509 --> 01:46:30,789
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

679
01:46:32,549 --> 01:46:33,549
Bamsı.

680
01:46:35,829 --> 01:46:37,389
May your sword never dull.

681
01:46:37,709 --> 01:46:39,629
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

682
01:46:53,269 --> 01:46:55,069
We found these in the cellar, sir.

683
01:47:02,549 --> 01:47:03,629
Thank you.

684
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:11,749
There might be
confidential reports there, sir.

685
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:55,469
Read each and every one of them,
Artuk Bey.

686
01:47:56,909 --> 01:48:00,949
I need a connection between
Ares and Emir Sadettin.

687
01:48:01,909 --> 01:48:05,389
I need strong evidence
when I go to see our Sultan.

688
01:48:05,589 --> 01:48:07,069
As you wish, sir.

689
01:48:07,429 --> 01:48:10,589
I'll check all of them
and report back to you.

690
01:48:10,709 --> 01:48:11,949
Thank you, Artuk Bey.

691
01:48:12,509 --> 01:48:16,349
I'll take one-fifth of all the spoils
to our Sultan.

692
01:48:17,349 --> 01:48:20,229
Use some of it to set up an almshouse.

693
01:48:20,989 --> 01:48:22,509
Also, we need a small mosque.

694
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:26,149
Share the rest equally
between the tribes.

695
01:48:26,389 --> 01:48:27,829
As you wish, sir.

696
01:48:34,549 --> 01:48:35,549
What happened, Dumrul?

697
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:37,829
There's news from Atsız, sir.

698
01:48:38,389 --> 01:48:39,789
He found Ares' tracks.

699
01:48:40,229 --> 01:48:41,269
He went after him.

700
01:48:46,589 --> 01:48:48,949
Atsız will surely find Ares.

701
01:48:49,389 --> 01:48:51,549
Tell everyone to spread out.

702
01:48:51,869 --> 01:48:53,349
As you wish, sir.

703
01:49:05,349 --> 01:49:06,989
Welcome, Mother Hayme.

704
01:49:08,629 --> 01:49:10,349
Welcome, Mother Hayme.

705
01:49:10,829 --> 01:49:11,829
Thank you.

706
01:49:25,069 --> 01:49:26,269
Good god.

707
01:49:27,429 --> 01:49:28,869
Look at this!

708
01:49:30,349 --> 01:49:34,229
What was a nest of Byzantine evil
until recently

709
01:49:34,989 --> 01:49:36,909
has been honored with Islam.

710
01:49:40,509 --> 01:49:42,469
Thank God, mother.

711
01:49:43,029 --> 01:49:45,349
We got to see these days.

712
01:49:46,109 --> 01:49:48,549
Hopefully, we will prosper
and revive this fortress.

713
01:49:49,029 --> 01:49:50,189
I hope so, dear.

714
01:49:50,589 --> 01:49:55,709
We can't thank God enough
for granting us with such a victory.

715
01:50:03,989 --> 01:50:05,029
My dear.

716
01:50:05,629 --> 01:50:06,629
What happened?

717
01:50:06,869 --> 01:50:07,869
Hafsa?

718
01:50:08,229 --> 01:50:09,229
Are you all right?

719
01:50:13,149 --> 01:50:16,029
I suffered so much in this castle...

720
01:50:17,349 --> 01:50:19,349
that I was born and brought up in.

721
01:50:21,029 --> 01:50:22,829
They killed my father.

722
01:50:23,589 --> 01:50:24,829
I was all alone.

723
01:50:25,509 --> 01:50:28,269
What would I do without you, Mother Hayme?

724
01:50:29,669 --> 01:50:32,269
As I came here, together with you,

725
01:50:32,629 --> 01:50:35,469
I'm both happy and sad at the same time.

726
01:50:38,189 --> 01:50:39,589
My sweetie.

727
01:50:40,589 --> 01:50:43,869
We'll live to see
many great days together.

728
01:50:43,989 --> 01:50:45,829
-Hopefully.
-I hope so.

729
01:50:54,189 --> 01:50:56,629
-Welcome, Mother Hayme.
-Thank you, Günkut.

730
01:50:57,389 --> 01:50:59,189
Let me take you to Ertuğrul Bey.

731
01:50:59,509 --> 01:51:00,509
Okay.

732
01:51:07,229 --> 01:51:08,549
Why is the bell ringing?

733
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:10,989
Ertuğrul Bey will give a speech
to the residents.

734
01:51:11,829 --> 01:51:13,749
It's to gather everyone around,
Mother Hayme.

735
01:51:16,189 --> 01:51:20,909
I know this fortress, Mother.
Let me show you around.

736
01:51:21,029 --> 01:51:23,429
-Sure, why not?
-So be it.

737
01:51:23,629 --> 01:51:25,589
Come on, take us to your dad.

738
01:51:25,869 --> 01:51:28,749
Come along then, Grandmother.

739
01:52:08,749 --> 01:52:13,109
When you told me that I couldn't
lay a hand on this castle,

740
01:52:14,029 --> 01:52:17,389
I said I'd show you all
whether I could do it or not.

741
01:52:18,509 --> 01:52:19,869
I trampled on your rule.

742
01:52:21,269 --> 01:52:23,109
I destroyed your armies.

743
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:29,869
And now, both Karacahisar Castle
and your throne are under my rule.

744
01:52:32,269 --> 01:52:36,829
Soon, the emperor of Nicaea
shall see this as well.

745
01:52:40,389 --> 01:52:41,829
Write this down, Artuk Bey.

746
01:52:53,469 --> 01:52:55,109
"Emperor Dukas.

747
01:52:57,509 --> 01:53:02,429
We ruined all the traps and plots

748
01:53:02,749 --> 01:53:04,749
of your Governor Ares.

749
01:53:08,229 --> 01:53:13,069
I made that coward who broke our peace
pay for it.

750
01:53:18,229 --> 01:53:24,949
Now, Karacahisar Castle is
under my rule.

751
01:53:29,229 --> 01:53:33,549
I'll send you Ares' head soon, as well.

752
01:53:37,869 --> 01:53:41,909
If the Governor of Bilecik makes

753
01:53:42,989 --> 01:53:45,789
the same treacherous mistake...

754
01:53:47,949 --> 01:53:50,669
he will share Ares' fate.

755
01:53:54,869 --> 01:53:56,149
Let it be known that...

756
01:53:57,269 --> 01:54:03,989
the might of our armies is enough
to take even Nicaea.

757
01:54:10,829 --> 01:54:12,949
Ruler of Karacahisar,

758
01:54:14,109 --> 01:54:15,949
Margrave of the Seljuks,

759
01:54:16,749 --> 01:54:19,309
Son of Suleyman Shah, Ertuğrul."

760
01:54:55,349 --> 01:54:56,349
Go now.

761
01:54:57,189 --> 01:54:59,309
Let everyone in Nicaea know
about my victory.

762
01:55:01,909 --> 01:55:03,629
And if they don't behave,

763
01:55:04,349 --> 01:55:07,349
tell them that we'll come
knocking on their doors.

764
01:55:33,589 --> 01:55:35,029
-Artuk Bey.
-Yes, sir.

765
01:55:35,189 --> 01:55:37,149
Gather some men.

766
01:55:38,149 --> 01:55:41,389
Have them scribble notices of our victory
and send them everywhere.

767
01:55:41,749 --> 01:55:43,229
As you wish, sir.

768
01:56:29,829 --> 01:56:30,829
Ho!

769
01:56:42,989 --> 01:56:45,189
This way. Come along.

770
01:56:47,229 --> 01:56:48,869
I know my way around here.

771
01:56:54,989 --> 01:56:57,269
Welcome, everyone.

772
01:56:58,589 --> 01:57:00,149
Welcome, Mother Hayme.

773
01:57:00,349 --> 01:57:02,789
-Halime Hatun, Aslıhan Hatun.
-Bamsı...

774
01:57:03,589 --> 01:57:04,589
Hafsa.

775
01:57:05,829 --> 01:57:06,909
Welcome.

776
01:57:07,149 --> 01:57:10,269
Bamsı, God bless you.

777
01:57:11,389 --> 01:57:13,669
We're so happy for this victory.

778
01:57:13,789 --> 01:57:15,789
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

779
01:57:16,629 --> 01:57:17,749
Marya!

780
01:57:21,029 --> 01:57:22,029
Gündüz.

781
01:57:25,789 --> 01:57:27,509
You are alive.

782
01:57:27,749 --> 01:57:29,509
I was worried about you.

783
01:57:29,789 --> 01:57:31,269
Is your wound okay?

784
01:57:31,509 --> 01:57:32,709
I'm all right, Gündüz.

785
01:57:33,629 --> 01:57:35,549
Now that I see you, I feel great.

786
01:57:36,309 --> 01:57:37,509
I'm all better now.

787
01:57:38,309 --> 01:57:40,309
God bless you, Marya.

788
01:57:41,429 --> 01:57:43,629
I hear you helped Gündüz.

789
01:57:44,149 --> 01:57:45,149
Thank you.

790
01:57:47,549 --> 01:57:50,109
Dear, Gündüz wouldn't stop
talking about you.

791
01:57:50,749 --> 01:57:52,069
I heard you protected him.

792
01:57:52,349 --> 01:57:54,989
God knows what would have happened
to him if you weren't around.

793
01:57:55,269 --> 01:57:56,269
Thank you.

794
01:57:56,989 --> 01:57:58,709
Gündüz is a clever boy.

795
01:57:58,909 --> 01:58:01,349
He'd have taken care of himself
even without me.

796
01:58:03,269 --> 01:58:06,429
Good. Come on now, let's go.

797
01:58:06,749 --> 01:58:07,749
Come on.

798
01:58:15,189 --> 01:58:16,909
Have our men do what's necessary, Turgut.

799
01:58:17,629 --> 01:58:18,709
Yes, sir.

800
01:58:20,149 --> 01:58:22,549
Daddy! Congratulations on your victory!

801
01:58:22,669 --> 01:58:24,149
Come here, big guy.

802
01:58:24,549 --> 01:58:29,389
You too will fight many wars like me
and conquer many other fortresses.

803
01:58:31,509 --> 01:58:32,709
God bless.

804
01:58:38,989 --> 01:58:40,069
Son.

805
01:58:41,509 --> 01:58:42,989
God bless your victory.

806
01:58:43,509 --> 01:58:46,029
I pray that God helps you
take many others,

807
01:58:46,309 --> 01:58:49,749
so that you may gain
more lands and fortresses.

808
01:58:54,469 --> 01:58:55,669
Thank you, Mother.

809
01:59:08,469 --> 01:59:10,469
God bless you, dear.

810
01:59:10,949 --> 01:59:12,629
Now that you took this fortress,

811
01:59:13,269 --> 01:59:15,829
we can never be proud enough of you.

812
01:59:16,749 --> 01:59:18,869
What's important is not
a castle, or a throne, Halime.

813
01:59:20,229 --> 01:59:25,309
What's important is for our flag
to ripple in God's name.

814
01:59:26,029 --> 01:59:32,669
As long as I'm alive,
I'll raise our flag wherever we need to.

815
01:59:38,389 --> 01:59:39,389
Ertuğrul Bey.

816
01:59:40,629 --> 01:59:42,629
God bless your conquest.

817
01:59:43,269 --> 01:59:46,829
May this be the beginning
of many other victories.

818
01:59:47,309 --> 01:59:49,189
Amen, Aslıhan Hatun.

819
01:59:49,429 --> 01:59:50,429
Amen.

820
01:59:51,229 --> 01:59:54,949
I have no doubt that
you'll bring justice to this castle

821
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:58,669
where my father was once its governor.

822
01:59:58,869 --> 02:00:00,469
I wish you all the best.

823
02:00:00,789 --> 02:00:02,189
Thanks, Hafsa Hatun.

824
02:00:07,149 --> 02:00:09,789
I'm happy to see you
alive and well, Marya.

825
02:00:11,149 --> 02:00:12,629
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.

826
02:00:13,429 --> 02:00:16,629
You avenged my brother.
What more could I ask for?

827
02:00:16,869 --> 02:00:18,949
Do you have a family
other than your brother?

828
02:00:19,869 --> 02:00:20,989
No.

829
02:00:22,189 --> 02:00:23,869
I have nowhere else to go.

830
02:00:27,589 --> 02:00:29,109
We can't leave you alone now.

831
02:00:30,189 --> 02:00:32,109
If you don't have anywhere to go,

832
02:00:32,789 --> 02:00:36,589
then come live with us
if that's okay with you.

833
02:00:41,269 --> 02:00:42,269
I'd be honored.

834
02:00:44,069 --> 02:00:45,269
But is that all right?

835
02:00:46,749 --> 02:00:48,189
I don't want to trouble you.

836
02:00:48,629 --> 02:00:53,829
Our tribe is home to those
who are brave, and trustworthy.

837
02:00:55,669 --> 02:00:58,349
Anyone may live with us
if they are trustworthy.

838
02:01:02,269 --> 02:01:05,109
You too may live with us.
Rest at ease.

839
02:01:08,549 --> 02:01:09,549
Artuk Bey.

840
02:01:09,869 --> 02:01:12,709
-Yes, sir.
-Treat Marya's wounds.

841
02:01:13,509 --> 02:01:16,829
Do your best so that she heals fast.

842
02:01:17,429 --> 02:01:19,749
As you wish, sir. Leave it to me.

843
02:01:21,109 --> 02:01:23,269
May God protect you, Ertuğrul Bey.

844
02:01:23,589 --> 02:01:26,269
-May God give you strength.
-Thank you, Marya.

845
02:01:39,509 --> 02:01:42,789
I'm so happy that you let
Marya live with us, Dad.

846
02:01:46,589 --> 02:01:47,829
God bless.

847
02:01:49,269 --> 02:01:50,349
My boy.

848
02:02:32,589 --> 02:02:33,709
Brothers.

849
02:02:34,349 --> 02:02:35,949
Let's surrender to Ertuğrul Bey.

850
02:02:36,069 --> 02:02:38,749
We can't surrender to the man
that killed Bahadir Bey.

851
02:02:39,269 --> 02:02:40,829
He killed Bahadir Bey.

852
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:43,189
It's all over now.

853
02:02:43,469 --> 02:02:45,349
We'll deal with him.

854
02:02:46,109 --> 02:02:49,429
<i>So, you killed Bahadir, huh?</i>
<i>God damn you, Ertuğrul.</i>

855
02:02:57,629 --> 02:02:58,629
Commander Ares.

856
02:03:52,269 --> 02:03:54,269
This isn't over, Ertuğrul.

857
02:03:54,629 --> 02:03:55,909
It's just begun, in fact.

858
02:04:49,269 --> 02:04:50,829
In the name of God

859
02:04:51,989 --> 02:04:57,309
who wills things into existence
and fills our hearts with faith.

860
02:04:58,629 --> 02:05:02,029
I'm Ertuğrul, son of Suleyman Shah.

861
02:05:03,389 --> 02:05:06,109
Let it be known

862
02:05:06,789 --> 02:05:12,429
that Justice replaces cruelty and fear
in these lands.

863
02:05:13,629 --> 02:05:17,589
We will treat everyone as equals.

864
02:05:18,669 --> 02:05:19,829
From now on,

865
02:05:20,349 --> 02:05:23,509
we shall all live in peace and harmony.

866
02:05:26,549 --> 02:05:31,349
We'll strengthen our home and trade
with justice.

867
02:05:32,869 --> 02:05:39,349
You may practice your religion in peace
on these lands.

868
02:05:46,589 --> 02:05:51,469
Justice, freedom, peace, and unity.

869
02:05:52,269 --> 02:05:53,789
That's our law.

870
02:05:54,309 --> 02:05:59,309
