00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 98 will start after 12:38 min.

13:08.026 --> 13:09.346
Thank God, my Bey<i>.</i>

13:09.546 --> 13:12.906
Thanks to you, brother Turgut's
loneliness has come to an end.

13:13.146 --> 13:16.226
There'll be twice the joy
once we take over the castle.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.466
I hope so, Bamsi. I hope so.

13:21.586 --> 13:25.586
-Is everything ready, Artuk Bey?
-Everything's ready, my Bey<i>.</i>

13:25.746 --> 13:28.066
The alps in the castle
are awaiting their orders.

13:28.666 --> 13:29.666
Very well.

13:31.306 --> 13:33.786
Come on then, alps! Let's be on our way.

13:59.946 --> 14:00.946
Turgut Alp?

14:02.626 --> 14:03.626
What's wrong?

14:06.226 --> 14:07.386
Ertuğrul Bey!

14:11.146 --> 14:12.386
Ertuğrul Bey!

14:17.666 --> 14:18.666
Turgut.

14:20.946 --> 14:21.946
Turgut Alp?

14:33.666 --> 14:36.826
-Turgut!
-Turgut! Brother!

14:39.626 --> 14:40.626
Turgut!

14:41.626 --> 14:42.866
Turgut, what happened?

14:43.066 --> 14:45.546
Turgut! My Turgut! My Turgut!

14:46.146 --> 14:48.386
My Turgut, what happened to you?

14:49.506 --> 14:53.466
Brother Turgut! Turgut! My Bey!
Artuk Bey! My Bey!

14:53.626 --> 14:56.066
Do something, my Bey.
Artuk Bey, do something!

14:56.786 --> 14:57.906
God!

15:10.146 --> 15:11.346
Turgut, come on.

15:12.186 --> 15:13.146
Aslıhan?

15:13.986 --> 15:16.866
Run to their tent, Halime. Quickly! Run!

15:16.986 --> 15:19.866
Turgut, stay with me!
Get yourself together, Turgut!

15:20.346 --> 15:21.586
Brother! Brother!

15:21.986 --> 15:24.306
Pull yourself together, brother.
What's happened to you?

15:29.146 --> 15:31.346
Aslıhan! Aslıhan!

15:32.386 --> 15:34.586
Aslıhan, what have they done to you,
sister?

15:35.026 --> 15:38.466
-What happened?
-Aslıhan? My girl!

15:39.026 --> 15:40.626
Aslıhan! My girl!

15:40.786 --> 15:41.786
Gently, gently!

15:41.906 --> 15:42.906
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

15:43.306 --> 15:44.666
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim! </i>My girl.

15:44.866 --> 15:46.826
-Aslıhan?
-Open your eyes, my girl.

15:47.066 --> 15:48.306
Quickly, loosen her clothes.

15:51.906 --> 15:55.746
My girl. Aslıhan! My girl!

15:55.986 --> 15:58.106
Come back to us, sister!

16:00.386 --> 16:01.986
Hang in there, for God's sake.

16:02.106 --> 16:05.066
-Hang in there!
-My Bey<i>, </i>he's been poisoned.

16:05.266 --> 16:07.626
God! Poison, he says! My Bey!

16:07.986 --> 16:09.026
Brother!

16:09.626 --> 16:11.666
-Turgut!
-Brother!

16:12.666 --> 16:14.706
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

16:15.946 --> 16:17.466
Hang in there, brother.

16:18.026 --> 16:19.706
Hang in there!

16:20.786 --> 16:22.866
Get him up! We'll carry him.

16:23.826 --> 16:26.666
-Let's go.
-Over here.

16:27.626 --> 16:28.986
Don't shake him.

16:32.626 --> 16:33.666
Don't shake him.

16:34.746 --> 16:35.826
Slowly.

16:40.746 --> 16:43.706
Turgut. Turgut!
Turgut, brother!

16:43.786 --> 16:45.106
-Turgut, brother.
-Turgut!

16:45.186 --> 16:48.826
Turgut, what happened to you?
Speak to me! Turgut, brother!

16:49.266 --> 16:51.906
Brother. Tell me, what happened Turgut?

16:52.106 --> 16:53.226
Brother.

16:54.346 --> 16:57.346
My Bey, Aslıhan is dying. Help her!

16:59.106 --> 17:02.706
-I can look after them both inside.
-Take care of Aslıhan Hatun, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

17:16.226 --> 17:17.146
Artuk Bey!

17:18.186 --> 17:19.306
Brother!

17:20.986 --> 17:22.546
-Bamsi?
-Yes, my Bey.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.266
-Get Turgut inside.
-Yes, my Bey.

17:24.426 --> 17:27.306
Come on, brothers.
Let's carry him. Brothers!

17:27.986 --> 17:29.786
Come on, brothers!

17:30.146 --> 17:31.386
Let's go!

17:31.666 --> 17:33.786
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim!</i>

17:34.346 --> 17:37.346
How is my niece, Ertuğrul Bey?
What's happened?

17:38.626 --> 17:42.106
Bahadir Bey<i>, </i>stay out of my sight.

17:43.466 --> 17:47.826
Even the mountains couldn't
contain my rage. Now leave.

17:51.586 --> 17:52.586
Kirca!

18:05.346 --> 18:06.946
No one is to leave the tribe.

18:07.386 --> 18:10.586
Don't kill anyone who tries to escape.
Instead, bring them immediately to me.

18:10.786 --> 18:11.746
Yes, my Bey.

18:25.946 --> 18:27.826
They're both showing the same symptoms.

18:28.306 --> 18:31.466
Difficulty in breathing,
bruising of hands and lips.

18:41.186 --> 18:43.866
Artuk Bey<i>, </i>they were fine
just a moment ago.

18:44.066 --> 18:45.386
What could have caused this?

18:45.866 --> 18:49.306
Another poison, Halime Sultan. Samsa!

18:51.186 --> 18:53.946
Go and get my pack
of remedies immediately.

18:54.386 --> 18:55.666
Yes, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

18:57.946 --> 19:00.786
-Hafsa Hatun, bring some water.
-Water.

19:01.426 --> 19:02.506
Turgut, son.

19:04.226 --> 19:08.186
Alps. Go to my tent.
We have matters to discuss.

19:08.266 --> 19:10.186
Aslıhan. Sister.

19:22.986 --> 19:24.106
And some salt.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.986
Ares! Ares, Ares, Ares, Ares!

19:28.106 --> 19:30.026
My Bey, this must be Ares' doing!

19:30.226 --> 19:32.266
He found out we were going
to attack the castle.

19:32.786 --> 19:35.786
Let's have his head.
Let's burn his castle down.

19:36.026 --> 19:37.146
Bamsi...

19:38.786 --> 19:41.346
We have to find out
what kind of poison it is, my Bey<i>.</i>

19:41.426 --> 19:46.026
If we don't find out, I won't be able
to prepare its antidote.

19:46.346 --> 19:47.626
My God.

19:48.506 --> 19:51.386
-God, help them.
-Mother?

19:54.826 --> 19:58.466
I'll find the person who can help us
find the source of the poison, Artuk Bey.

19:58.586 --> 20:01.746
-Very well, my Bey<i>.</i>
-Bamsi, come with me.

20:04.346 --> 20:05.466
God!

20:06.586 --> 20:08.946
-My girl!
-Bring it here.

20:10.226 --> 20:11.106
Aslıhan.

20:13.426 --> 20:14.426
Get the water.

20:15.586 --> 20:19.146
Pour it. Enough.

20:24.546 --> 20:26.026
What're you going to do, Artuk Bey?

20:26.106 --> 20:28.266
We're going to use the salty water
to make them vomit.

20:30.706 --> 20:31.706
Come on.

20:40.226 --> 20:43.586
That's it. Esma's got the job done.

20:44.746 --> 20:47.746
I'll go inform his Eminence.

20:48.226 --> 20:51.786
Wait for Esma. Kill her when she arrives.

20:52.746 --> 20:56.586
You've been serving the blessed Emir
as one of Bahadir's alps all this time.

20:57.946 --> 21:00.346
If you accomplish this mission, too

21:01.466 --> 21:04.426
you'll get to serve the Emir in Konya.

21:06.506 --> 21:08.746
This is a gift from the Emir.

21:12.026 --> 21:14.066
Tell him that the job will be done.

21:14.946 --> 21:16.866
May God bless him.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.026
Very good.

21:20.226 --> 21:22.226
You know where to go
when you finish your task.

21:23.226 --> 21:24.666
Go on then, prove yourself.

21:33.706 --> 21:35.786
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

21:38.106 --> 21:39.106
All right.

21:42.626 --> 21:44.546
All right. You're all right, sister.

21:45.906 --> 21:47.746
-All right. Good God.
-Aslıhan.

21:48.066 --> 21:49.866
What kind of poison is this?

21:51.186 --> 21:54.666
Look what they did to them
on their wedding day.

21:56.266 --> 21:59.626
-Come.
-God, please help us in our time of need.

22:00.586 --> 22:03.946
My God, please protect them both.

22:04.946 --> 22:06.746
Don't separate them from each other.

22:08.706 --> 22:10.026
Aslıhan.

22:11.746 --> 22:14.586
-He's back!
-Turgut, son.

22:14.706 --> 22:16.546
-Turgut Alp?
-Thank God.

22:19.946 --> 22:21.866
Make Aslıhan drink it.

22:24.546 --> 22:26.546
Make Aslıhan drink it.

22:28.586 --> 22:30.826
-Hayme Hatun.
-Give it here.

22:31.466 --> 22:34.426
Aslıhan? My girl!

22:35.906 --> 22:38.306
Aslıhan? Aslıhan, my girl.

22:38.586 --> 22:40.066
Don't tire yourself, sister.

22:42.466 --> 22:44.826
-Let's get your head up. <i>Bismillah.</i>
-Come on.

22:45.106 --> 22:47.466
Come here, take a sip.

22:52.186 --> 22:53.186
<i>Bismillah.</i>

22:56.226 --> 22:57.226
Sister.

22:57.506 --> 22:58.506
Turgut?

22:58.746 --> 23:01.386
Turgut is here. He's all right, too.

23:01.866 --> 23:03.666
You'll get better, my girl.

23:11.746 --> 23:12.746
Turgut?

23:17.666 --> 23:21.986
Artuk Bey, what happened to us?

23:25.506 --> 23:26.626
How is Turgut?

23:26.946 --> 23:32.426
Aslıhan Hatun, drink the salty water.
It will make you vomit out the poison.

23:32.986 --> 23:33.986
Go on.

23:34.186 --> 23:36.266
-Come on, sister.
-Here.

23:38.066 --> 23:39.866
Hang in there, sister.

23:40.546 --> 23:43.786
Turgut Alp, come on. Come on, brother.

23:50.626 --> 23:52.426
Halime, prepare more salty water.

23:54.426 --> 23:55.426
Brothers,

23:56.586 --> 24:00.106
we first need to find the bastard
who poisoned Turgut and Aslıhan Hatun.

24:01.306 --> 24:04.226
If we get him, we'll find out
who gave the order.

24:05.146 --> 24:09.906
That's why, until this issue is settled,
we hold off the raid on the castle.

24:11.626 --> 24:15.226
Abdur Rahman, let the alps know.
Tell them to come back here.

24:15.426 --> 24:16.426
As you command, my Bey<i>.</i>

24:16.586 --> 24:20.066
Hey! And tell Atsiz to get a hold
of the trader coming from Nicaea.

24:20.626 --> 24:24.106
He should capture him and bring
him to me. You're to help Atsiz.

24:24.346 --> 24:25.426
As you command, my Bey.

24:26.986 --> 24:29.946
Artuk Bey! Artuk Bey!
Tell me, will they live?

24:30.466 --> 24:35.186
We either find the antidote
or we pray for them to die swiftly, Bamsi.

24:36.106 --> 24:39.226
Artuk Bey, what are you saying?
What are you saying, Artuk Bey?

24:39.946 --> 24:43.346
My Bey, I've never seen anything like it.

24:43.986 --> 24:47.826
They are conscious,
they hear what we say.

24:48.026 --> 24:51.066
Yet they don't have
the strength even to talk.

24:51.346 --> 24:56.626
Their bodies are decaying quickly.
Furthermore, they are in agony.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.906
Their bodies are decaying, my Bey<i>.</i>

25:11.066 --> 25:15.506
Whoever did this wanted them
to suffer greatly before they died.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.786
Whoever did this holds
a great grudge against us, my Bey.

25:22.386 --> 25:25.226
How much time do you have
to find the poison and prepare antidote?

25:25.506 --> 25:29.946
If we can't find the source of the poison
we have until the sun goes down, my Bey.

25:36.786 --> 25:40.266
Bamsi! We don't have time to shed tears.

25:41.546 --> 25:44.546
-Yes, my Bey.
-Find Kirca and Esma at once.

25:44.746 --> 25:48.386
Bring whoever goes in and out
of their tents to me. Immediately!

25:48.466 --> 25:50.026
-Yes, my Bey.
-Yes, my Bey.

25:51.986 --> 25:53.586
If we can't find who poisoned them,

25:53.986 --> 25:56.066
we won't know
who gave the order, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

25:57.426 --> 26:00.226
We need to find out who gave the order
so that you can prepare the antidote.

26:01.266 --> 26:02.386
Who could it be, my Bey?

26:06.706 --> 26:09.986
There are certain people who would
do this to Turgut Alp and Aslıhan Hatun.

26:10.306 --> 26:14.826
Either Emir Sadettin,
or his lap dog Bahadir.

26:17.586 --> 26:21.546
We'll find out who it was, Artuk Bey.
There's no other way.

26:22.466 --> 26:25.466
We found ourselves in the middle
of a trap during a battle.

26:25.786 --> 26:27.906
If we fail to get something
good out of this turmoil,

26:28.906 --> 26:30.106
then there will be blood.

26:33.706 --> 26:36.186
But first, we save them.

26:37.506 --> 26:38.666
Yes, my Bey.

27:00.113 --> 27:02.073
I'm glad they've been poisoned.

27:03.553 --> 27:05.793
I hope neither of them sees the sunrise.

27:13.033 --> 27:17.473
This is not good, wife.

27:19.113 --> 27:21.753
-Not good at all.
-Why, my Bey?

27:23.273 --> 27:27.753
Don't you see,
they didn't even accept my help.

27:28.953 --> 27:31.553
Ertuğrul sent me away from the tent.

27:32.633 --> 27:34.873
Who do you think they'll suspect first?

27:35.433 --> 27:40.313
It's not as if we're on good terms
with Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut.

27:49.913 --> 27:53.473
They'll interrogate us first.

27:56.553 --> 27:59.913
Obviously, someone has set a trap.

28:01.793 --> 28:07.113
But it wasn't only Turgut and
Aslıhan Hatun who were targeted.

28:08.513 --> 28:10.273
We're also their victims.

28:12.233 --> 28:16.033
Ertuğrul will certainly come for me.

28:18.033 --> 28:20.113
But I know exactly what to do.

28:20.993 --> 28:21.953
Kaya Tekin!

28:27.353 --> 28:30.993
-Yes, my Bey<i>.</i>
-Gather your alps around my tent.

28:31.473 --> 28:35.553
If Ertuğrul's alps come here,
don't let them pass.

28:36.713 --> 28:37.793
As you command, my Bey<i>.</i>

28:46.753 --> 28:53.513
If Ertuğrul dares hold me responsible
for this poisoning scheme

28:54.873 --> 28:58.193
I'll make him pay for it.

29:08.873 --> 29:09.913
Son.

29:11.953 --> 29:12.953
Aslıhan?

29:19.153 --> 29:20.153
Aslıhan?

29:21.113 --> 29:24.153
Sister, don't wear yourself out.
We're here.

29:27.273 --> 29:28.273
Sister.

29:30.753 --> 29:31.953
Mother Hayme.

29:32.153 --> 29:36.273
My girl, Aslıhan. Don't tire yourself.
You'll get better.

29:36.393 --> 29:38.313
My God, please help them.

29:38.713 --> 29:40.393
I can't take this anymore.

29:45.193 --> 29:48.553
-Give me your blessings.
-My girl.

29:52.433 --> 29:53.793
How can you say that?

29:55.073 --> 29:57.913
Ertuğrul Bey will find
the antidote for you.

29:58.473 --> 30:03.113
You'll be better in no time.
Don't talk like you're saying goodbye.

30:03.793 --> 30:07.313
-Give me your blessings.
-Aslıhan.

30:08.033 --> 30:09.033
Aslıhan!

30:09.833 --> 30:11.073
Aslıhan...

30:11.993 --> 30:15.713
Artuk Bey! Hurry!
Aslıhan Hatun is getting worse!

30:17.313 --> 30:18.513
Aslıhan Hatun?

30:19.913 --> 30:21.593
Aslıhan, sister!

30:21.713 --> 30:22.713
Son.

30:32.313 --> 30:33.393
Artuk Bey?

30:36.593 --> 30:37.753
Aslıhan.

30:41.113 --> 30:42.153
Aslıhan?

30:46.913 --> 30:47.913
Aslıhan?

30:51.833 --> 30:52.873
Aslıhan?

30:58.233 --> 30:59.673
Aslıhan...

31:08.113 --> 31:09.393
Thank God.

31:17.153 --> 31:20.233
God, help us. Son.

31:25.633 --> 31:26.953
Ertuğrul, my son.

31:28.513 --> 31:29.673
Sister.

31:30.673 --> 31:31.673
Turgut.

31:35.913 --> 31:37.153
Aslıhan Hatun.

31:39.513 --> 31:43.953
I'll find who did this
and the antidote to the poison, brother.

31:44.633 --> 31:46.673
I'll make them pay for what they've done.

31:48.313 --> 31:51.913
I know, my Bey<i>. </i>I know.

31:55.113 --> 31:56.473
Ertuğrul Bey<i>...</i>

31:56.993 --> 32:03.313
Aslıhan Hatun, don't worry. I'll find
the antidote to this poison, I promise.

32:05.313 --> 32:07.153
I'm not afraid to die.

32:09.353 --> 32:13.793
I'm afraid evil people
will take over my tribe.

32:16.033 --> 32:20.033
Ertuğrul Bey<i>...</i>
I entrust my tribe to you.

32:22.073 --> 32:28.633
Don't let my tribe fall
into the hands of Bahadir Bey<i>. </i>Don't.

32:31.873 --> 32:33.273
-Aslıhan.
-Halime.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.273
That's enough, don't wear yourself out.

32:39.273 --> 32:41.193
-Aslıhan!
-Aslıhan!

32:41.553 --> 32:42.633
My girl!

32:46.193 --> 32:48.753
-Aslıhan!
-Don't worry.

32:49.113 --> 32:51.033
They're so weary, they've gone to sleep.

33:05.833 --> 33:11.513
But Bey, we will lose them both
if we don't find the antidote soon.

33:30.553 --> 33:32.713
-<i>Selamunaleykum</i>.
-<i>Aleykumselamun</i>.

33:51.073 --> 33:52.113
What are you doing here?

33:53.273 --> 33:54.753
Looking for an ointment for my wounds.

34:02.953 --> 34:04.313
Why are you in such a hurry?

34:07.193 --> 34:09.353
Someone poisoned
Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut Alp<i>.</i>

34:09.953 --> 34:11.833
I'm here to get Artuk Bey's bag.

34:13.113 --> 34:14.313
Who would do that?

34:15.073 --> 34:16.033
We don't know.

34:16.913 --> 34:18.353
But we'll find out sooner or later.

34:26.353 --> 34:29.633
It's not anywhere!
Where the hell is his bag?

34:37.153 --> 34:38.353
Is this it?

34:44.033 --> 34:47.073
Good man, God bless you.
Come on, we need to go right now.

34:47.313 --> 34:49.033
We'll leave you to it. Come on!

34:59.433 --> 35:00.633
Blessed Emir.

35:04.753 --> 35:05.953
What is it, Göktuğ?

35:06.273 --> 35:09.033
Esma did her job, Your Eminence.

35:09.553 --> 35:12.913
Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut Alp
lie on their death beds.

35:15.233 --> 35:16.433
Very good.

35:18.233 --> 35:23.073
Ertuğrul will go after Esma
if he finds out about her.

35:23.593 --> 35:29.273
Whether it's Esma or Alpamis,
if Ertuğrul gets hold of either of them,

35:29.513 --> 35:33.273
and they give your name
to him, it'll be bad.

35:34.353 --> 35:36.833
Alpamis is waiting for Esma,
Your Eminence.

35:37.713 --> 35:39.473
He will kill her when she arrives.

35:41.313 --> 35:45.393
Take your men and kill Alpamis
as soon as he's done with Esma.

35:47.433 --> 35:49.393
As you command, blessed Emir.

35:53.593 --> 35:57.553
<i>Such a pity, Aslıhan. Such a pity.</i>

36:49.033 --> 36:52.753
<i>My dear friend Ares, I'm sure</i>
<i>you'll find this information useful.</i>

37:05.073 --> 37:06.713
We've already explained
everything, my Bey.

37:06.793 --> 37:08.793
We are the only ones
who entered the tent.

37:19.313 --> 37:22.433
That's all we know, my Bey<i>.</i>
We've nothing else to say.

37:34.273 --> 37:35.353
Leave.

37:42.553 --> 37:43.953
Esma, you stay here!

38:03.593 --> 38:05.073
Think it through, Esma.

38:05.993 --> 38:07.993
You're Aslıhan Hatun's right hand woman.

38:08.873 --> 38:13.753
Did you miss anything?
Who else entered the tent except you?

38:16.433 --> 38:22.553
Except for me, Halime Sultan,
Hafsa Hatun and Mother Hayme, my Bey.

38:26.193 --> 38:27.313
And Kirca.

38:30.353 --> 38:33.833
Kirca! Is there anyone you suspect?

38:34.153 --> 38:38.353
My Bey<i>, </i>we watched
everyone who entered the tent.

38:38.753 --> 38:40.273
I know everyone who went in.

38:40.393 --> 38:42.473
Is this how you do your job, Kirca?

38:42.993 --> 38:45.033
You were meant to protect Aslıhan Hatun!

38:47.993 --> 38:51.913
Whoever poisoned them
did it right before your eyes!

38:52.513 --> 38:56.313
You were meant to protect Aslıhan's life
and the tribe's honor.

38:57.033 --> 38:58.313
Talk to me, Esma!

39:06.393 --> 39:09.953
Find whoever did this
and punish them, my Bey<i>.</i>

39:10.633 --> 39:13.193
Aslıhan Hatun trusted no one but you.

39:15.193 --> 39:17.833
There's no one else I can trust either.

39:21.673 --> 39:22.913
Look at me, Esma!

39:24.473 --> 39:25.713
Look into my eyes!

39:27.353 --> 39:30.313
Pull yourself together.
You will not give up.

39:31.113 --> 39:35.433
Think, Esma, think! Who did this?

39:36.193 --> 39:39.473
What are we missing?
Think about it and answer me!

39:39.673 --> 39:41.233
I don't know, my Bey. I don't.

39:42.473 --> 39:46.153
They made grief out of our joy,
and poison out of sherbet.

39:48.833 --> 39:51.633
God damn them, those fiends.

39:52.273 --> 39:53.753
May God punish them.

39:58.793 --> 40:00.873
-Kirca?
-Yes, my Bey<i>.</i>

40:01.633 --> 40:04.673
-Take Esma Hatun to her tent.
-Yes, my Bey<i>.</i>

40:07.593 --> 40:08.913
Sister, come on.

40:12.673 --> 40:14.833
I'd die for Aslıhan Hatun.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.593
Kill me and relieve me
of this shame, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

40:29.473 --> 40:30.593
Bamsi!

40:34.073 --> 40:37.873
-Yes, my Bey<i>.</i>
-Keep watch over Esma.

40:39.913 --> 40:41.513
She's the one who poisoned them.

40:42.153 --> 40:46.953
What do you mean, my Bey<i>?</i>
Then why did you let her go?

40:47.993 --> 40:49.633
You heard what I said, Bamsi.

40:50.553 --> 40:54.033
You have to watch her. And her tent.

40:55.033 --> 40:56.673
Follow her if she leaves the tribe.

40:57.313 --> 40:59.113
She will take us to her masters.

41:00.353 --> 41:01.553
You understand me, Bamsi?

41:01.953 --> 41:04.913
-Yes, my Bey<i>.</i> I understand.
-Go on, then.

41:25.433 --> 41:26.833
Where is the sherbet jug?

41:32.153 --> 41:33.233
My Bey<i>.</i>

41:40.833 --> 41:41.953
It's here, my Bey<i>.</i>

41:44.193 --> 41:45.793
Do you have news, my Bey?

41:46.073 --> 41:48.513
Esma betrayed herself
out of fear, Artuk Bey.

41:49.593 --> 41:51.713
She told me the poison
was in the sherbet.

41:54.433 --> 41:57.753
How could she know
that when we didn't, son?

41:59.433 --> 42:02.913
She couldn't possibly know
unless she was the one who put it there.

42:13.353 --> 42:14.713
Where is Esma, my Bey<i>?</i>

42:15.673 --> 42:18.193
She remains unaware that
I suspect her, Artuk Bey.

42:18.593 --> 42:23.513
She's in her tent.
Bamsi will follow her like her shadow.

42:23.953 --> 42:28.513
If she is indeed the culprit
she'll take us to her masters.

42:31.273 --> 42:32.793
Give Esma to us, son.

42:34.593 --> 42:37.353
Don't dirty your hands
with the blood of a wicked woman.

42:37.913 --> 42:39.993
We'll get her to talk.

42:40.313 --> 42:44.433
Mother! All she could do is confess.

42:45.753 --> 42:49.193
We want to find the one
who ordered her to do it.

42:49.993 --> 42:51.433
Ertuğrul Bey is right.

42:51.593 --> 42:54.953
If we're to save Turgut and Aslıhan Hatun,
we need to find out who poisoned them

42:55.153 --> 42:56.913
but more importantly who gave the order.

42:57.113 --> 42:59.553
Esma couldn't possibly know that.

42:59.753 --> 43:04.193
But Artuk Bey<i>, </i>you said we had no time.
They're dying as we speak!

43:04.673 --> 43:06.873
Once Samsa brings my bag
we'll know for sure

43:07.153 --> 43:11.273
if it was the sherbet that was poisoned.
I can then prepare an antidote.

43:13.353 --> 43:17.233
We have to be patient until we can
confirm the sherbet was poisoned, Mother.

43:17.553 --> 43:22.353
By then, Esma will have tried to escape.
And Bamsi will be following her.

43:23.873 --> 43:25.433
My Bey<i>, </i>what if she doesn't escape?

43:27.153 --> 43:30.633
Then, she'll be talking

43:30.953 --> 43:32.953
through the blood in her mouth.

43:37.393 --> 43:38.513
Günküt!

43:43.913 --> 43:44.913
Yes, my Bey<i>.</i>

43:45.233 --> 43:47.593
Bring Bahadir Bey
and Karaca Hatun to my tent.

43:47.873 --> 43:48.953
Right away, my Bey<i>.</i>

44:12.513 --> 44:14.713
Even if Ertuğrul knows you're innocent

44:14.793 --> 44:17.593
he'll try to use this as an opportunity
to get rid of you, my Bey<i>.</i>

44:18.713 --> 44:23.953
I'm not the type of man
who goes down without a fight.

44:25.753 --> 44:29.553
If he has plans...
then I have my own plans.

44:32.513 --> 44:35.753
My Bey, we've been through a lot.

44:36.873 --> 44:38.673
But this is different.

44:39.233 --> 44:42.393
Ertuğrul will have your head
if he decides he wants it.

44:42.993 --> 44:45.353
Let's take our alps
and leave, if necessary.

44:46.113 --> 44:47.353
Look at me, wife!

44:48.473 --> 44:50.993
Do you want them to say
Bahadir Bey got scared and ran away?

44:53.353 --> 44:56.073
I'm not afraid of anyone.

44:56.993 --> 45:01.553
And I don't want cowards on my side.
Understood?

45:05.673 --> 45:11.673
Ertuğrul can come and take
my head if he has the guts.

45:28.953 --> 45:31.473
You can't take anyone from this tent.

45:33.033 --> 45:36.713
Leave, before you force us
to do something nobody wants.

45:42.713 --> 45:43.953
What's going on?

45:50.873 --> 45:53.993
Our Bey will go only if he wants to do so.

45:56.993 --> 46:00.153
I'll crush every one of you and take
your bey anyway if you don't leave.

46:00.633 --> 46:02.633
I'd like to see you try.

46:25.873 --> 46:27.313
What's going on here?

46:31.633 --> 46:34.233
Release my alps at once!

46:34.633 --> 46:37.393
We're taking you to Ertuğrul Bey,
Bahadir Bey<i>.</i>

46:37.993 --> 46:40.073
We'll do whatever's necessary
if you resist.

46:45.673 --> 46:48.953
I won't be summoned by Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

46:49.673 --> 46:54.313
There is my tent. He can come
here if he has something to say.

46:54.593 --> 46:58.433
Bahadir Bey<i>,</i>
Ertuğrul Bey has commanded you!

46:58.833 --> 47:01.673
Don't make us drag you to him
in front of your alps<i>.</i>

47:18.833 --> 47:20.113
What's happening, Artuk Bey<i>?</i>

47:22.313 --> 47:26.753
They'll die in agony
if we don't find the antidote, my Bey.

47:31.553 --> 47:33.313
God, help us.

47:34.473 --> 47:36.033
Please help us, God.

47:43.313 --> 47:46.513
Dear God, help us.

47:50.953 --> 47:52.073
Son.

47:58.313 --> 48:00.753
-Aslıhan?
-My girl!

48:10.073 --> 48:10.953
Bahadir Bey<i>.</i>

48:13.673 --> 48:14.993
Bahadir Bey did this.

48:17.353 --> 48:21.073
Ertuğrul Bey, Bahadir Bey poisoned us,

48:35.033 --> 48:35.953
All right.

48:37.673 --> 48:38.553
All right!

48:39.353 --> 48:42.033
I'll go talk with Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

48:44.593 --> 48:47.233
Bahadir Bey, Karaca Hatun is to come too.

48:50.473 --> 48:53.833
Look here! Know your place!

48:54.273 --> 48:55.993
What does he want with my wife?

48:56.073 --> 48:58.713
Ertuğrul Bey summoned both of you!

49:17.913 --> 49:22.113
Alps, take their swords. Tie their hands.

51:06.633 --> 51:08.713
We brought Bahadir Bey
and Karaca Hatun, my Bey<i>.</i>

51:15.553 --> 51:17.833
I'll make them pay
for turning your wedding day

51:18.913 --> 51:21.073
into the worst day of your life,
Aslıhan Hatun.

53:23.233 --> 53:26.793
I came to help as soon
as I saw something was wrong.

53:27.673 --> 53:29.273
Yet you sent me away.

53:30.033 --> 53:31.833
Why are you asking for me now,
Ertuğrul Bey?

53:33.393 --> 53:36.513
Someone poisoned Turgut Alp
and Aslıhan Hatun, Bahadir Bey.

53:40.393 --> 53:44.553
You've disrupted the peace here
with your anger and ambition

53:45.073 --> 53:47.353
from the moment you arrived.

53:49.433 --> 53:52.193
You wouldn't let Aslıhan Hatun
and Turgut Alp be.

53:54.153 --> 53:56.993
No one has a stronger motive
to poison them than you, Bahadir Bey.

53:59.473 --> 54:02.273
You ruined my reputation.

54:03.353 --> 54:04.953
You banished my son.

54:05.633 --> 54:07.873
Now you're accusing me
of being a poisoner?

54:09.753 --> 54:12.073
You don't know me at all, Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

54:13.273 --> 54:19.353
If I wanted to kill them, I'd do it
with my sword. Like a man.

54:20.713 --> 54:22.553
Do you think I don't know

54:23.753 --> 54:27.673
that you aim to be leader of the Cavdars
by siding with Emir Sadettin?

54:29.953 --> 54:33.953
If I did side with him,
it means I side with the state.

54:35.193 --> 54:40.073
If this is a crime
then do whatever you can to stop me.

54:43.793 --> 54:48.113
You are the margrave
and I am a bey of the Cavdars.

54:50.873 --> 54:53.993
You have no authority over me,
Ertuğrul Bey.

54:54.833 --> 54:58.793
But, I know exactly what you want to do.

55:00.113 --> 55:02.393
You want Turgut
to be the leader of the Cavdars

55:03.313 --> 55:05.633
and to banish me,
just like you did my son.

55:07.713 --> 55:12.313
You wanted to take control of the Cavdars
through your puppet Turgut.

55:14.713 --> 55:15.793
Tell me,

55:16.393 --> 55:19.353
are you angry now because you can
see your plan slipping away from you?

55:22.833 --> 55:27.353
I banished your son to teach him a lesson.

55:33.513 --> 55:35.553
But I would take your head, Bahadir Bey<i>.</i>

55:39.393 --> 55:40.473
Is that so?

55:41.833 --> 55:42.833
Go ahead.

55:43.793 --> 55:45.833
Do your best.

55:49.153 --> 55:51.713
You have no reason
to blame us for this, Ertuğrul Bey.

55:54.193 --> 55:56.233
We'll not take this lying down.

55:59.113 --> 56:00.313
We'll see.

56:02.753 --> 56:04.033
We will see.

56:08.473 --> 56:10.473
Take Bahadir Bey to the prisoner’s tent.

56:11.433 --> 56:13.673
Karaca Hatun will not leave her tent.

56:14.993 --> 56:18.993
Gather their alps in front of their tent.
I want to talk to each one of them.

56:21.953 --> 56:25.233
You don't know what you're doing,
Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

56:29.113 --> 56:33.713
But, you have my word,
I will stand my ground

56:34.433 --> 56:37.553
until I make you eat your words.

56:37.953 --> 56:39.073
Take him.

57:00.313 --> 57:03.513
Brave warriors, it's time.

57:04.193 --> 57:08.433
As soon as Ertuğrul Bey is in
the castle we start fighting.

57:09.233 --> 57:10.993
Stay sharp.

57:12.233 --> 57:17.313
With God's permission, our flags will
be flying from the walls of the castle

57:18.513 --> 57:20.993
even if we become martyrs.

57:24.593 --> 57:25.633
Brother Abdurrahman!

57:27.833 --> 57:29.233
Are we good to go?

57:32.313 --> 57:33.833
There will be no raid today, brother.

57:39.873 --> 57:40.873
What's wrong?

57:42.473 --> 57:45.833
Turgut Alp and Aslıhan Hatun
have been poisoned.

57:46.433 --> 57:47.593
They're dying.

57:50.193 --> 57:51.513
Bastards!

57:53.033 --> 57:54.473
Who could do such a thing?

57:54.913 --> 57:56.633
We don't know yet.

57:56.993 --> 57:59.793
Ertuğrul Bey has postponed the raid
so he can find out who did it

58:00.073 --> 58:03.913
and save Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut Alp<i>.</i>

58:10.713 --> 58:13.073
Then you should go back to the tribe.

58:14.393 --> 58:16.233
I'll stay here.

58:16.913 --> 58:20.113
Ertuğrul Bey wants you to capture
the trader from Nicaea

58:20.233 --> 58:21.913
and bring him safely to him.

58:22.833 --> 58:25.593
My alps will go back to the tribe.
I'll stay with you.

58:31.393 --> 58:32.913
Let's be on our way then.

58:33.513 --> 58:36.073
We'll need to capture the trader
before he gets near the castle.

58:57.393 --> 59:00.153
Sir, news from Titan.

59:02.033 --> 59:04.193
So, he's managed
to infiltrate the Kayi tribe.

59:05.553 --> 59:08.193
We've finally penetrated
the defenses of our greatest enemy.

59:08.473 --> 59:10.993
Let's see what he has to say
about the Kayi tribe.

59:17.673 --> 59:18.873
What does he say, sir?

59:22.633 --> 59:25.793
Turgut Alp and Aslıhan Hatun
were poisoned on their wedding night.

59:30.833 --> 59:34.993
Why do you look so worried, sir?
Turks are killing each other again.

59:40.153 --> 59:43.953
We can't have Ertuğrul's rage
focusing on us, Kostas.

59:44.353 --> 59:47.513
It could tie our hands
while we're preparing for war.

59:48.993 --> 59:51.153
Who would want to poison them, sir?

59:53.353 --> 59:56.553
Someone prepared to use
even me to crush Ertuğrul.

59:58.193 --> 59:59.553
Emir Sadettin.

01:00:01.233 --> 01:00:02.953
With his Sultan's support,

01:00:03.073 --> 01:00:05.873
Ertuğrul not only had Emir Sadettin
ordered out of these lands,

01:00:05.953 --> 01:00:08.593
he also crushed the horse
Sadettin was betting on.

01:00:08.873 --> 01:00:10.473
He even banished Bahadir's son.

01:00:11.473 --> 01:00:14.593
But why would Sadettin poison them, sir?

01:00:17.753 --> 01:00:22.393
Aslıhan was to marry Sadettin,
but Ertuğrul had her marry Turgut Alp.

01:00:23.273 --> 01:00:27.153
But I know Sadettin.
There must be more to this.

01:00:28.473 --> 01:00:33.913
But we can't let Ertuğrul suspect us
and force us to stay in the castle.

01:00:34.753 --> 01:00:36.633
So, what will you do, sir?

01:00:38.793 --> 01:00:41.753
I'd rather face
a brave warrior like Ertuğrul

01:00:42.473 --> 01:00:46.313
than scum like Sadettin.

01:00:47.033 --> 01:00:50.113
We will go to the Cavdar tribe.
Make the necessary preparations.

01:00:51.233 --> 01:00:54.433
Let's show Ertuğrul Bey that we're
with him in his time of trouble.

01:00:55.593 --> 01:00:56.753
Get my horse ready.

01:00:57.633 --> 01:00:58.953
Yes, sir.

01:01:35.673 --> 01:01:37.353
Did anyone follow you?

01:01:37.433 --> 01:01:40.313
Don't worry. I was very discreet.

01:01:40.473 --> 01:01:45.073
-The job's done, right?
-Definitely. They're both going to die.

01:01:45.193 --> 01:01:48.353
Good. His Eminence sends his regards.

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:52.913
He wanted me to give you this
in return for your services.

01:02:14.473 --> 01:02:17.433
Who? who is your master? Bastard!

01:02:21.713 --> 01:02:24.433
Goddamn it! That's Bamsi, Ertuğrul's alp<i>.</i>

01:02:24.633 --> 01:02:26.833
Who gave the order to poison them?

01:02:28.833 --> 01:02:29.753
Come on, talk!

01:02:30.193 --> 01:02:31.913
Where is the antidote, tell me!

01:02:32.073 --> 01:02:34.473
I'll send you to hell
just like I did them.

01:02:34.673 --> 01:02:37.393
I won't draw my sword. We need you alive!

01:02:37.633 --> 01:02:38.713
Come on.

01:02:38.953 --> 01:02:40.193
God!

01:02:41.273 --> 01:02:45.873
Now, I have you by the throat.
I've got you!

01:02:45.953 --> 01:02:48.073
You'll tell us everything now!

01:02:54.673 --> 01:02:55.953
How are they, Artuk Bey?

01:02:56.313 --> 01:02:57.993
It's not good, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:02:58.713 --> 01:03:03.473
As I said, I first of all need to find out
if the sherbet is what poisoned them.

01:03:03.993 --> 01:03:07.633
Then we can identify the poison
and act accordingly.

01:03:13.353 --> 01:03:15.753
My Bey. I've brought the bag, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

01:03:16.153 --> 01:03:17.673
Hurry, Artuk Bey<i>.</i>

01:03:17.753 --> 01:03:20.353
Samsa, bring the sherbet jug from inside.

01:03:32.073 --> 01:03:36.833
Now we'll see if the sherbet
was poisoned or not.

01:03:46.993 --> 01:03:50.513
If it's poisonous,
it will turn purple, my Bey.

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:19.553
You were right, my Bey<i>.</i>
The poison was in the sherbet.

01:04:21.673 --> 01:04:24.233
Samsa. Bring Esma at once.

01:04:24.473 --> 01:04:25.633
Yes, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:04:39.913 --> 01:04:43.633
Tell me everything!
Where is the antidote?

01:04:45.073 --> 01:04:46.393
Tell me!

01:04:46.993 --> 01:04:49.073
Stop, enough. I'll talk.

01:04:49.473 --> 01:04:50.593
Kill them.

01:05:05.873 --> 01:05:09.993
Alpamis is dead.
Let's go before Bamsi sees us.

01:05:18.633 --> 01:05:22.153
Who gave the order
to poison Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut?

01:05:22.553 --> 01:05:24.633
Tell me, where is the antidote?

01:05:24.753 --> 01:05:28.113
Where is it? Speak up! Speak up.

01:05:28.273 --> 01:05:29.993
Tell me. Don't die, speak!

01:05:34.073 --> 01:05:35.033
Speak!

01:05:35.833 --> 01:05:40.273
You didn't help us,
but maybe your corpse will.

01:05:56.873 --> 01:06:00.073
This will help them breathe more easily.

01:06:01.393 --> 01:06:03.353
And when the bottle is empty, Artuk Bey?

01:06:04.433 --> 01:06:06.633
Then there's nothing
more I can do, my Bey.

01:06:07.513 --> 01:06:13.073
That's why we need to get
the antidote as a matter of urgency.

01:06:14.713 --> 01:06:17.553
We will, Artuk Bey<i>. </i>We will.

01:06:20.593 --> 01:06:23.793
My Bey, Bamsi and Esma
are nowhere to be found.

01:06:27.713 --> 01:06:29.593
Bamsi must have gone after Esma.

01:07:10.233 --> 01:07:11.233
Make way.

01:07:12.033 --> 01:07:14.353
Make way! Move.

01:07:14.633 --> 01:07:15.673
Make way.

01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:19.833
Make way.

01:07:28.393 --> 01:07:29.633
Let me pass.

01:07:30.833 --> 01:07:31.993
I said make way.

01:07:39.433 --> 01:07:40.313
My Bey<i>.</i>

01:07:41.153 --> 01:07:42.313
What happened, Bamsi?

01:07:43.273 --> 01:07:45.073
Where's Esma? Who's this man?

01:07:45.153 --> 01:07:48.233
My Bey, Esma tried
to escape from the tribe.

01:07:48.833 --> 01:07:51.913
I followed her as you instructed.

01:07:52.153 --> 01:07:55.553
She met with this man outside the tribe.

01:07:55.993 --> 01:08:01.873
He gave Esma a pouch of gold coins.
I figured they were working together.

01:08:02.353 --> 01:08:05.553
And then this bastard killed Esma.

01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:10.193
So I went there and got the bastard,
but just as I was bringing him to you,

01:08:10.353 --> 01:08:12.593
someone shot him, my Bey.

01:08:13.273 --> 01:08:16.633
My Bey, I couldn't go after them
as I didn't have my horse.

01:08:17.153 --> 01:08:20.993
I brought his dead body
thinking it might be useful.

01:08:21.593 --> 01:08:22.553
Very good, Bamsi.

01:08:25.273 --> 01:08:26.913
-Kirca.
-Yes, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:08:27.433 --> 01:08:29.433
Who is he? Is he one of yours?

01:08:29.833 --> 01:08:31.433
No, my Bey<i>. </i>That's Alpamis.

01:08:32.353 --> 01:08:33.673
He's one of Bahadir Bey's alps<i>.</i>

01:08:34.113 --> 01:08:36.753
I told you no one was to leave
the tribe, right, Kirca?

01:08:37.433 --> 01:08:39.033
How did he get out?

01:08:39.553 --> 01:08:41.193
My Bey<i>, </i>Alpamis was never here.

01:08:53.166 --> 01:08:54.806
Is what Kirca said true?

01:08:55.886 --> 01:08:57.246
Is this man Alpamis?

01:08:58.806 --> 01:08:59.926
He is, my Bey.

01:09:01.766 --> 01:09:05.846
Alpamis didn't travel here with us.
He was coming later with our tribe.

01:09:07.126 --> 01:09:08.966
I don't know why he's here.

01:09:09.926 --> 01:09:15.686
My Bey, Bahadir obviously used
this man to do his dirty work for him.

01:09:32.206 --> 01:09:35.046
Come on, brothers, take the body away.

01:09:35.246 --> 01:09:37.726
Come on, brothers. Come on.

01:10:10.526 --> 01:10:13.326
Alps... Out.

01:10:22.286 --> 01:10:23.686
Tell me about Alpamis.

01:10:24.566 --> 01:10:25.606
What about him?

01:10:37.966 --> 01:10:42.566
Alpamis secretly met up with Esma
outside the tribe.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:44.686
Then he killed her.

01:10:45.126 --> 01:10:48.966
So Esma was the one who poisoned them.

01:10:51.006 --> 01:10:52.166
Aslıhan!

01:10:53.246 --> 01:10:57.486
And you thought
a woman could be their bey.

01:11:01.046 --> 01:11:05.966
If Esma is a traitor,
so is your alp Alpamis, Bahadir Bey.

01:11:07.286 --> 01:11:10.846
You ordered Alpamis
to tell Esma to poison them.

01:11:17.326 --> 01:11:20.726
I'm fed up with your empty words,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:11:21.686 --> 01:11:25.526
That dog Alpamis was to come
later with the rest of my tribe.

01:11:26.126 --> 01:11:28.246
I don't know why he's here.

01:11:31.246 --> 01:11:33.086
Still you lie to me.

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:41.206
You gave Alpamis his orders.
You gave Esma gold to poison them.

01:11:41.286 --> 01:11:44.646
That's not true... Not true.

01:11:45.366 --> 01:11:49.326
Who knows whose dog Alpamis was?

01:11:50.246 --> 01:11:56.686
But if you intend to do away with me,
do it now, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:11:57.366 --> 01:11:59.606
Let both of us be rid of this.

01:12:00.726 --> 01:12:03.486
Until the day

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:09.006
that dog deceives you too, eh?

01:12:17.606 --> 01:12:19.166
Still you say it wasn't you.

01:12:19.406 --> 01:12:21.366
It wasn't me!

01:12:21.966 --> 01:12:25.806
Ertuğrul Bey,
I fear neither you nor death.

01:12:25.926 --> 01:12:31.126
Do what you will.
But know that I didn't do it!

01:12:52.166 --> 01:12:54.086
My Bey. My Bey.

01:12:54.566 --> 01:12:57.086
Ares, Governor Ares is here.

01:13:03.206 --> 01:13:04.206
Alps!

01:13:06.726 --> 01:13:07.686
Yes, my Bey.

01:13:08.566 --> 01:13:12.086
Tie him up well.
I'll finish with him when I get back.

01:13:46.966 --> 01:13:48.446
Why are you here, Ares?

01:13:48.886 --> 01:13:50.006
I heard what happened.

01:13:50.206 --> 01:13:51.926
I thought maybe I could be of use.

01:13:52.646 --> 01:13:56.446
So, you heard what happened.
Your ears are sharp.

01:14:01.046 --> 01:14:04.086
Everyone from here to Hanli bazaar
heard about what happened, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:14:05.126 --> 01:14:06.166
My condolences.

01:14:07.766 --> 01:14:09.126
They are still alive.

01:14:10.566 --> 01:14:13.166
What fiend uses a poison
that kills so slowly?

01:14:14.566 --> 01:14:17.206
One that wanted them to suffer
before they died.

01:14:17.566 --> 01:14:20.566
Well, well, well.
Such spite must run deep.

01:14:26.126 --> 01:14:27.366
Come with me.

01:14:47.606 --> 01:14:48.726
What's going on, Bamsi Alp?

01:14:49.806 --> 01:14:53.966
We are lost in a forest, brother.
I can no longer see the path.

01:14:54.726 --> 01:14:58.086
I don't know.
I really don't know, brother.

01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:18.766
You say you're here to help me.

01:15:20.126 --> 01:15:21.686
How am I meant to trust you, Ares?

01:15:21.966 --> 01:15:26.006
I came to help a margrave who had offered
his hand in fellowship. Isn't that enough?

01:15:27.006 --> 01:15:31.086
You and Emir Sadettin tried to take
control of Hanli bazaar in my absence.

01:15:31.526 --> 01:15:33.086
How can I trust your word?

01:15:34.806 --> 01:15:36.446
Yes, that's true.

01:15:37.646 --> 01:15:38.566
But what of it?

01:15:39.286 --> 01:15:42.566
In peacetime, we both want to develop
our trade. It's our duty to do so.

01:15:44.966 --> 01:15:48.926
The gold that Bahadir Bey used
to buy the market...

01:15:49.766 --> 01:15:50.886
How much of it was yours?

01:15:53.086 --> 01:15:55.206
You are very clever, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:15:56.046 --> 01:15:57.966
Just one transaction.

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.486
It was only business.

01:16:01.446 --> 01:16:05.206
You came back,
Emir Sadettin's rule is over.

01:16:05.806 --> 01:16:09.046
From now on, I will maintain
the peace and trade with you.

01:16:09.726 --> 01:16:12.366
From now on, I deal only with you.

01:16:13.886 --> 01:16:15.926
What can you do for Turgut and Aslıhan?

01:16:16.846 --> 01:16:21.326
I don't know who did this
but I can give you a lead to follow.

01:16:21.526 --> 01:16:22.406
What does that mean?

01:16:22.886 --> 01:16:24.846
I had my suspicions riding in,

01:16:25.006 --> 01:16:29.126
but when you said the one who did this
wanted them to suffer but not die,

01:16:29.206 --> 01:16:30.286
I was sure.

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:31.926
What were you sure of?

01:16:32.166 --> 01:16:33.606
The herbalist who prepared the poison.

01:16:34.206 --> 01:16:37.726
I now know for certain who prepared
the poison for Aslıhan and Turgut.

01:16:38.526 --> 01:16:39.406
Who?

01:16:40.366 --> 01:16:44.886
A well-known herbalist from Nicaea.
An old priest who has forsaken God.

01:16:45.366 --> 01:16:48.206
Competent enough to make someone
suffer without causing their death.

01:16:48.846 --> 01:16:50.166
Where can I find him?

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:53.606
I heard he lived
on the outskirts of Hell Hill.

01:16:54.206 --> 01:16:57.286
He went into seclusion in one
of the caves at the bottom of the valley.

01:16:58.046 --> 01:17:02.166
If you find the priest, you might be
able to help Aslıhan and Turgut.

01:17:02.406 --> 01:17:05.406
And I would have extended
a helping hand to a friend.

01:17:06.006 --> 01:17:07.726
Who knows, instead of
offering my condolences,

01:17:07.846 --> 01:17:10.966
perhaps I will be able to extend
my best wishes to the newlyweds one day.

01:17:11.326 --> 01:17:14.286
But this is all I can do, Ertuğrul Bey.
The rest is up to you.

01:17:15.286 --> 01:17:17.006
God save the lovers.

01:17:17.246 --> 01:17:19.446
With your permission
I'll leave Commander Kostas here.

01:17:20.086 --> 01:17:22.006
I'd like to be kept informed
of what happens.

01:17:23.286 --> 01:17:24.486
Thank you, Ares.

01:17:27.606 --> 01:17:28.486
Door.

01:17:39.126 --> 01:17:40.766
Bamsi followed Esma.

01:17:41.326 --> 01:17:44.526
He saw Alpamis killing her,
then caught him.

01:17:46.366 --> 01:17:48.766
But we got there in time, Your Eminence.

01:17:50.126 --> 01:17:53.446
We finished Alpamis off
before Bamsi could make him talk.

01:17:56.726 --> 01:17:58.686
We got away before he saw us.

01:18:00.126 --> 01:18:01.206
Good.

01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:06.846
Bamsi will have taken
the body back to the tribe.

01:18:08.966 --> 01:18:14.846
And when Ertuğrul sees that it is
Alpamis, one of Bahadir's alps...

01:18:17.646 --> 01:18:20.406
Everything is working in our favor
for now, Göktuğ.

01:18:20.846 --> 01:18:22.686
I have another mission for you.

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:24.686
I'm at your command, Your Eminence.

01:18:26.286 --> 01:18:29.006
Find the herbalist who made
the poison and kill him.

01:18:29.566 --> 01:18:31.406
We can't leave anything
which ties him to us.

01:18:33.966 --> 01:18:35.486
Yes, Your Eminence.

01:18:40.126 --> 01:18:43.486
They won't find the antidote
which could heal Turgut and Aslıhan.

01:18:45.686 --> 01:18:49.086
First, the two of them will die...
and then Bahadir.

01:18:52.286 --> 01:18:54.086
Things will be thrown into confusion.

01:18:55.526 --> 01:18:58.366
That is when I will return.

01:18:59.726 --> 01:19:04.886
And in order to re-establish order,
I will take Ertuğrul's head.

01:19:08.926 --> 01:19:11.206
-Aslıhan! Aslıhan, my sister.
-Turgut, my son.

01:19:11.966 --> 01:19:13.166
-Turgut.
-Turgut Alp.

01:19:14.246 --> 01:19:15.766
-Turgut!
-Turgut Alp.

01:19:15.886 --> 01:19:16.846
Sister!

01:19:18.246 --> 01:19:23.006
-Sister.
-Artuk Bey, Aslıhan Hatun can't breathe!

01:19:24.086 --> 01:19:25.566
Artuk Bey, what are we going to do?

01:19:25.646 --> 01:19:28.486
-Turgut, gather yourself.
-Sister.

01:19:28.686 --> 01:19:31.046
-Aslıhan!
-Turgut. My God!

01:19:31.126 --> 01:19:34.646
-Artuk Bey!
-Halime Sultan. Open her mouth.

01:19:35.606 --> 01:19:37.046
Come here, come.

01:19:37.846 --> 01:19:41.486
-My God, help them.
-Open your mouth. She won't, Artuk Bey!

01:19:41.766 --> 01:19:44.686
-Aslıhan, open your mouth.
-My girl!

01:19:46.526 --> 01:19:49.086
-Open up.
-Open it, Halime Sultan.

01:19:52.366 --> 01:19:54.326
Aslıhan! Aslıhan!

01:19:57.046 --> 01:20:00.646
-Turgut. My God.
-Halime Sultan, have her drink this.

01:20:00.966 --> 01:20:02.726
-Hafsa.
-We're losing her.

01:20:03.286 --> 01:20:04.886
-What?
-Hafsa.

01:20:05.446 --> 01:20:08.766
-Come, Hafsa!
-Artuk Bey! Artuk Bey!

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:18.966
My Bey, we're losing them.

01:20:20.086 --> 01:20:23.366
I'm not sure if they
will see another sunset.

01:20:28.126 --> 01:20:29.326
Ares came here.

01:20:30.406 --> 01:20:34.366
He said he knew the herbalist who made
the poison and told me where to find him.

01:20:35.126 --> 01:20:36.446
What is Ares after?

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:39.286
He said Emir Sadettin's rule is over.

01:20:39.766 --> 01:20:42.326
He wanted
to further his friendship with me.

01:20:43.366 --> 01:20:44.566
Bastard!

01:20:45.206 --> 01:20:46.966
Who knows what he's thinking, my Bey.

01:20:47.406 --> 01:20:51.086
But we have no choice.
They're both on the verge of death.

01:20:54.566 --> 01:20:56.286
Then I must set off right away.

01:20:56.686 --> 01:20:59.286
My Bey, let me come with you.

01:20:59.446 --> 01:21:01.566
There's nothing more I can do here.

01:21:02.006 --> 01:21:06.086
There's nothing I can do to help either
Aslıhan Hatun or Turgut Alp anymore.

01:21:06.846 --> 01:21:10.486
If Ares is right, my knowledge
as a healer will come in handy, my Bey.

01:21:13.326 --> 01:21:14.526
All right, Artuk Bey.

01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:17.126
-We will ride together.
-Thank you, my Bey.

01:21:18.046 --> 01:21:19.246
Hafsa, open her mouth.

01:21:20.766 --> 01:21:22.326
Turgut! Turgut!

01:21:23.526 --> 01:21:25.046
Aslıhan Hatun, open up.

01:23:08.566 --> 01:23:09.646
What do you want?

01:23:12.766 --> 01:23:14.846
My master sends his regards.

01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:19.846
The poison you prepared
was quite effective.

01:23:22.286 --> 01:23:24.086
He wants another bottle.

01:23:25.406 --> 01:23:26.446
Wait.

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:09.166
My Bey.

01:24:10.806 --> 01:24:12.406
My Bey.

01:24:13.606 --> 01:24:15.966
What is it, Bamsi? Are there tracks?

01:24:22.366 --> 01:24:23.726
There are, my Bey.

01:24:24.566 --> 01:24:27.766
There are. And they're fresh, my Bey.

01:24:28.046 --> 01:24:30.886
There's no doubt someone's
been here before us.

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:34.846
The bastards that ordered the poison
may well have come to kill the herbalist.

01:24:35.766 --> 01:24:38.086
Come on alps, let's find this cave.
Come on.

01:24:42.086 --> 01:24:42.926
Come on.

01:25:06.206 --> 01:25:11.046
So, to make the antidote
you also use the poison from that snake.

01:25:11.166 --> 01:25:12.126
You do.

01:25:16.166 --> 01:25:17.806
Then let's make sure no one can.

01:25:24.086 --> 01:25:25.406
Why do you want to kill me?

01:25:25.766 --> 01:25:28.246
We can't have others knowing our secret.

01:25:40.206 --> 01:25:44.886
I've destroyed your only hope.
There's nothing left to heal you now.

01:26:03.006 --> 01:26:04.726
Secure the area, alps.

01:26:35.926 --> 01:26:37.366
This is the cave.

01:26:40.246 --> 01:26:41.526
Be on your guard.

01:26:43.206 --> 01:26:44.846
We don't know what awaits inside.

01:27:10.006 --> 01:27:14.766
Have we entered the devil's lair?
What is this place, my Bey?

01:27:18.366 --> 01:27:19.966
Just as I thought.

01:27:21.406 --> 01:27:23.486
The bastards killed him
to cover their tracks.

01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:27.126
My Bey, how will we find the antidote now?

01:27:37.566 --> 01:27:41.086
Whoever killed the herbalist chose to kill
only this animal out of all the others.

01:27:41.926 --> 01:27:45.526
The poison they gave Turgut Alp
and Aslıhan Hatun must have come from it.

01:27:46.046 --> 01:27:48.606
He killed it so that we
couldn't use it to make the antidote.

01:27:49.526 --> 01:27:53.006
My Bey, if this animal is dead,

01:27:53.126 --> 01:27:56.246
how will we make the antidote
for my brother Turgut and Aslıhan Hatun?

01:27:56.806 --> 01:27:58.846
If there's still poison in it,
we can do it, Bamsi.

01:27:58.966 --> 01:28:02.286
-Get me a cup.
-Cup. Cup, cup.

01:28:05.326 --> 01:28:08.166
Artuk Bey, Artuk Bey,
will this do? Will it do?

01:28:10.686 --> 01:28:14.046
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:28:16.166 --> 01:28:18.526
My Bey, I pray it's as I hope.

01:28:19.046 --> 01:28:21.926
We'll see now whether
there's any poison left in it.

01:28:43.926 --> 01:28:46.766
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:28:57.326 --> 01:28:59.886
Thank God, my Bey. This is the poison.

01:29:00.806 --> 01:29:02.446
I'll make up the antidote now.

01:29:03.366 --> 01:29:04.366
Thank God.

01:29:04.926 --> 01:29:08.046
Make it quickly, Artuk Bey.
We have to get it to them before sunset.

01:29:08.126 --> 01:29:09.686
-Thank God.
-Yes, my Bey.

01:29:09.766 --> 01:29:10.726
Thank God.

01:29:17.086 --> 01:29:19.606
Sister, drink this.

01:29:20.526 --> 01:29:21.526
Drink.

01:29:23.006 --> 01:29:25.646
Sister. Hafsa, fill it.

01:29:26.886 --> 01:29:31.206
Hang on, Turgut.
Hang on just a little bit longer, my son.

01:29:31.726 --> 01:29:35.526
Ertuğrul has gone to get you
the antidote, Turgut Alp.

01:29:36.566 --> 01:29:37.486
Aslıhan.

01:29:41.846 --> 01:29:43.726
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:29:44.206 --> 01:29:47.446
Hang in there, sister. You'll get better.

01:29:56.646 --> 01:29:58.646
Thank God,
she seems to be breathing a little.

01:29:59.126 --> 01:30:00.046
Come on.

01:30:09.926 --> 01:30:12.846
Thank God. Aslıhan, my daughter.

01:30:20.406 --> 01:30:21.366
Aslıhan.

01:30:22.326 --> 01:30:23.526
Aslıhan.

01:30:30.046 --> 01:30:33.526
Sister, come on.
Hang on just a little longer. Come on.

01:30:34.126 --> 01:30:35.326
You'll be fine.

01:30:38.726 --> 01:30:39.886
Sister!

01:30:51.486 --> 01:30:53.726
My Bey, get this to them at once.

01:30:53.806 --> 01:30:57.846
Have them both drink it when you get
there. It'll have an immediate effect.

01:30:57.926 --> 01:31:01.886
Allow me to stay here. I'll gather any
herbs that could be useful to us, my Bey.

01:31:02.886 --> 01:31:04.126
All right, Artuk Bey.

01:31:05.006 --> 01:31:08.926
Günküt, you stay with Artuk Bey.
Come after us.

01:31:09.886 --> 01:31:12.726
Bamsi and I will get the antidote
to them right away.

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:17.366
-God speed, Artuk Bey.
-God speed, my Bey.

01:31:17.446 --> 01:31:18.566
Let's go, my Bey.

01:32:08.846 --> 01:32:09.846
Artuk Bey?

01:32:10.766 --> 01:32:12.846
What is it? What are these herbs?
Are they important?

01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:15.646
They are so important that

01:32:15.726 --> 01:32:18.806
they will have heads roll
and save others.

01:32:20.486 --> 01:32:24.246
We have to get back to the tribe
before it's too late. Come on.

01:32:39.886 --> 01:32:41.286
Sister, come on.

01:32:43.446 --> 01:32:44.326
Aslıhan.

01:32:46.006 --> 01:32:50.486
My girl. Hold on, my girl.
He'll be here soon, hold on.

01:33:05.086 --> 01:33:07.806
Give me your...

01:33:12.326 --> 01:33:13.566
blessing...

01:33:16.006 --> 01:33:17.766
Blessing. Give me...

01:33:18.246 --> 01:33:20.446
No! Don't say that!

01:33:21.126 --> 01:33:23.286
No! Don't say that!

01:33:23.366 --> 01:33:24.886
-No!
-Aslıhan.

01:33:25.566 --> 01:33:29.206
-Turgut.
-Aslıhan. Aslıhan!

01:33:30.966 --> 01:33:31.926
Sister.

01:33:33.766 --> 01:33:37.086
Hold on. A little longer.

01:33:59.206 --> 01:34:00.846
No, Turgut!

01:34:01.526 --> 01:34:06.166
God, please help us! Dear God!

01:34:08.446 --> 01:34:09.366
Mother!

01:34:16.846 --> 01:34:17.846
Mother!

01:34:18.806 --> 01:34:21.606
Come, let's get you out. Come on.

01:34:22.366 --> 01:34:24.646
-My son!
-Hafsa, you stay. Mother, come.

01:34:26.246 --> 01:34:27.606
-Come on, Mother.
-My girl!

01:34:48.446 --> 01:34:49.446
Come on!

01:34:51.846 --> 01:34:53.126
Come on!

01:35:07.806 --> 01:35:09.286
The sun's nearly setting, Bamsi.

01:35:09.646 --> 01:35:11.726
-We have to be quicker!
-Let's go, my Bey, let's go.

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:14.766
My Aktolga, my white maned one.

01:35:15.366 --> 01:35:16.686
You are my wings.

01:35:17.166 --> 01:35:20.606
Be my wings once more
so that before darkness falls

01:35:20.926 --> 01:35:24.046
we may foil this cruel plot! Come on.

01:36:01.846 --> 01:36:03.686
<i>They defend it more heavily</i>
<i>during the day.</i>

01:36:05.366 --> 01:36:06.886
<i>So, we will do it at night.</i>

01:36:17.966 --> 01:36:21.206
-Keep at it!
-Thank you. God speed.

01:36:21.486 --> 01:36:22.406
Darius!

01:36:24.326 --> 01:36:25.566
Hello, little hero!

01:36:26.886 --> 01:36:31.446
What are you doing here? Are you
on your way to claim the flying horse?

01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:35.166
No, I...
I just wanted to look around the tribe.

01:36:35.566 --> 01:36:39.006
Darius is going to take me
on the flying horse. Right, Darius?

01:36:39.326 --> 01:36:40.246
Sure.

01:36:41.446 --> 01:36:45.166
It will be soon.
The winged horse will come soon.

01:36:45.406 --> 01:36:48.526
But he only comes at night.
I'll tell you when he's here.

01:36:48.806 --> 01:36:50.206
-Okay?
-Okay.

01:36:50.806 --> 01:36:52.686
Come, let's get to the tent,
Gündüz Bey.

01:36:53.046 --> 01:36:56.166
If you should need anything,
ask one of the alps.

01:36:56.286 --> 01:36:59.886
You don't know the tribe yet.
Don't wander far from your tent.

01:37:01.086 --> 01:37:02.086
Thank you.

01:37:09.286 --> 01:37:15.566
<i>Don't worry. I might not know the tribe</i>
<i>but your tribe will know me soon enough.</i>

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:30.326
The herbalist and the snake that the
poison came from are dead, Your Eminence.

01:37:30.966 --> 01:37:35.566
It will be impossible to save
Aslıhan Hatun or Turgut Alp now.

01:37:40.246 --> 01:37:41.286
Pity.

01:37:42.726 --> 01:37:44.326
If you'd had a little more sense...

01:37:45.846 --> 01:37:50.286
you could have been one of the most
esteemed women of the Seljuks.

01:37:52.886 --> 01:37:54.726
Alas, you did not.

01:37:55.926 --> 01:37:57.846
And you paid for it with your life.

01:38:02.406 --> 01:38:05.446
Even if you were sorry now,
what good would it do?

01:38:08.086 --> 01:38:09.846
Farewell, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:38:14.446 --> 01:38:15.606
Farewell.

01:38:21.326 --> 01:38:24.366
Göktuğ. We're done here for now.

01:38:25.446 --> 01:38:28.406
There's important business
awaiting us in Konya.

01:38:29.846 --> 01:38:32.886
Those who think
I am just the Emir of the state...

01:38:33.646 --> 01:38:35.846
will see that I am the state itself.

01:38:37.126 --> 01:38:41.406
It's in my hands to uphold the state
or raze it to the ground.

01:38:42.206 --> 01:38:44.446
Everyone will bow to my power.

01:38:45.006 --> 01:38:49.566
Those who don't will pay
the price with their blood.

01:38:51.046 --> 01:38:52.446
Ertuğrul...

01:38:54.126 --> 01:38:55.326
and the sultan.

01:38:58.646 --> 01:38:59.646
Let's go.

01:39:11.286 --> 01:39:12.566
Ertuğrul Bey is back!

01:39:22.206 --> 01:39:23.846
Did you find the cave?

01:39:23.966 --> 01:39:26.806
Ares was right. I come with the antidote.

01:39:27.446 --> 01:39:29.726
Tell him I will never forget this!

01:39:29.846 --> 01:39:31.446
I hope they survive, Ertuğrul Bey!

01:39:44.046 --> 01:39:45.406
Help me, Bamsi.

01:39:54.966 --> 01:39:58.206
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i> Come, sister.

01:40:02.766 --> 01:40:04.526
God, God.

01:40:05.646 --> 01:40:07.406
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:40:11.326 --> 01:40:14.606
-My God, the healer.
-Help them, God.

01:40:18.286 --> 01:40:20.486
My God. My God.

01:40:21.126 --> 01:40:23.566
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:40:24.006 --> 01:40:25.566
My God, the healer.

01:40:35.646 --> 01:40:37.406
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:40:40.366 --> 01:40:42.046
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:40:42.686 --> 01:40:46.006
My God, the healer. My God, the healer.

01:40:47.126 --> 01:40:48.286
Come, brother.

01:40:49.006 --> 01:40:51.406
-My God, help them.
-Brother.

01:40:53.846 --> 01:40:56.686
-Help them, God.
-My God, the healer.

01:40:56.766 --> 01:41:00.966
Here you go, my Bey. Come on. God.

01:41:03.686 --> 01:41:07.406
Come back to us, brother. Come back.

01:41:08.846 --> 01:41:10.646
Come on, brother, gather yourself.

01:41:18.006 --> 01:41:22.926
When will the remedy take effect, my Bey?
I'm worried we're too late.

01:41:24.206 --> 01:41:26.286
He who gives the woe,
gives the cure, Bamsi.

01:41:27.486 --> 01:41:29.726
From this point on, it's up to God.

01:41:30.926 --> 01:41:34.326
Whatever he sees fit, we will accept.

01:41:35.006 --> 01:41:36.126
Yes, my Bey.

01:41:36.806 --> 01:41:37.726
However...

01:41:38.846 --> 01:41:41.046
we now have a great mission.

01:41:41.926 --> 01:41:42.886
What, my Bey?

01:41:43.446 --> 01:41:48.046
We will get our revenge on the ones
who did this to them, Bamsi.

01:41:48.886 --> 01:41:51.406
All right, my Bey. All right.

01:41:54.366 --> 01:41:55.526
Come on, God.

01:41:57.566 --> 01:41:58.486
Samsa!

01:42:01.646 --> 01:42:03.726
-Yes, my Bey.
-Bring Bahadir Bey to my tent.

01:42:04.486 --> 01:42:05.606
As you command, my Bey.

01:42:36.566 --> 01:42:39.366
We've come to take you
before Ertuğrul Bey.

01:42:39.446 --> 01:42:42.566
What for? Is his judgement not over?

01:42:46.166 --> 01:42:49.526
The judgement is over,
now he will name your punishment.

01:42:52.246 --> 01:42:55.286
So, it's time to take my head.

01:42:58.286 --> 01:43:00.486
Tell them to bring my bow.

01:43:01.126 --> 01:43:05.966
If he is to kill me, let it be a death
worthy of a bey, by way of my bow.

01:43:16.246 --> 01:43:17.326
Don't worry.

01:43:18.046 --> 01:43:21.366
Ertuğrul Bey punishes
everyone exactly as they deserve.

01:43:30.606 --> 01:43:33.966
My God, you are the healer.

01:43:35.366 --> 01:43:37.206
You are the one who heals.

01:43:39.086 --> 01:43:42.286
Pull this madness out of my children.

01:43:43.286 --> 01:43:45.446
Give them back to us, my God.

01:43:49.286 --> 01:43:51.566
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:43:58.486 --> 01:44:00.726
Mother, Aslıhan is coming round.

01:44:01.526 --> 01:44:02.566
Aslıhan!

01:44:03.686 --> 01:44:06.406
-Sister.
-Thank God.

01:44:07.126 --> 01:44:09.646
-Thank God!
-Thank you, God!

01:44:09.726 --> 01:44:12.006
Sister. Are you feeling better?

01:44:18.686 --> 01:44:24.206
My son. My valiant son.
Open your eyes, Turgut.

01:44:24.726 --> 01:44:25.886
Come on, son.

01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:39.806
Turgut.

01:44:41.926 --> 01:44:44.646
-How is Turgut?
-Turgut is fine.

01:44:44.886 --> 01:44:46.366
He'll recover, my girl.

01:44:48.326 --> 01:44:53.766
Sister, don't you worry about that.
Rest. You're both going to be fine.

01:44:56.486 --> 01:44:58.246
Thank you, God.

01:45:16.566 --> 01:45:18.726
Why is the sultan here?

01:45:19.046 --> 01:45:23.166
His lieutenant said that he's
accepted the envoys from Crimea

01:45:23.246 --> 01:45:25.566
together with Cobanoglu Husamettin.

01:45:26.886 --> 01:45:32.566
He wants to see you
once the envoys have left, Your Eminence.

01:45:37.406 --> 01:45:38.246
Good.

01:45:40.286 --> 01:45:41.566
Let's wait and see.

01:46:34.686 --> 01:46:37.166
Sir, Ertuğrul Bey has
returned to the tribe.

01:46:37.686 --> 01:46:40.366
They found the priest who made
the poison and brought the antidote.

01:46:42.926 --> 01:46:44.166
Thank God!

01:46:45.726 --> 01:46:49.646
Someone like Ertuğrul Bey
will never forget such a favor, Kostas.

01:46:50.606 --> 01:46:52.526
Now he owes us two lives.

01:46:52.926 --> 01:46:55.246
We have considerable
leverage against him now.

01:46:55.846 --> 01:46:57.646
What will you do now, sir?

01:47:01.086 --> 01:47:03.806
We have won Ertuğrul's trust, Kostas.

01:47:04.686 --> 01:47:07.646
We will use our leverage
to our best advantage.

01:47:08.126 --> 01:47:11.286
Ertuğrul Bey will give
us whatever we ask for.

01:47:11.686 --> 01:47:13.406
He'll refuse us nothing.

01:47:14.526 --> 01:47:17.566
We'll corner him
with what we get from him.

01:47:18.046 --> 01:47:20.006
With the two lives we saved today,

01:47:20.246 --> 01:47:23.326
we will slay Ertuğrul
and the Turks tomorrow.

01:47:34.166 --> 01:47:36.606
Our Sultan awaits you, Your Eminence.

01:48:10.745 --> 01:48:11.905
My Sultan...

01:48:19.545 --> 01:48:23.345
Is Ertuğrul fulfilling his duties,
Sadettin?

01:48:28.705 --> 01:48:31.345
He's discharging them satisfactorily,
my Sultan.

01:48:31.945 --> 01:48:36.465
The Turk tribes are pleased that
he returned safe and sound.

01:48:39.345 --> 01:48:42.665
And you? Are you also pleased?

01:48:44.305 --> 01:48:45.505
Of course, my Sultan.

01:48:46.385 --> 01:48:51.785
Ertuğrul is your chosen margrave.
I respect him as a brave Turk bey.

01:48:51.865 --> 01:48:53.025
Of course I'm pleased.

01:48:54.745 --> 01:49:01.185
Then why were you incapable
of carrying out my orders, Sadettin?

01:49:01.625 --> 01:49:06.065
I went to war against the Ayyubids
when beset by the Mongolian scum.

01:49:07.065 --> 01:49:10.945
And you returned victorious.
May God never take you away from us.

01:49:13.145 --> 01:49:14.145
And you?

01:49:15.545 --> 01:49:17.065
What were you doing all this time?

01:49:19.385 --> 01:49:22.905
You failed to find the traitors
who plotted against Ertuğrul.

01:49:23.945 --> 01:49:26.745
And you failed to avenge
the blood of his alps.

01:49:27.825 --> 01:49:31.705
Did you think I wouldn't hold you
responsible for your failures

01:49:31.825 --> 01:49:35.265
and for making the state
look so weak, Sadettin?

01:49:43.145 --> 01:49:44.225
My Sultan...

01:49:45.505 --> 01:49:48.945
according to the testimonies
of the surviving alps

01:49:49.065 --> 01:49:51.865
the attackers were bandits.

01:49:54.345 --> 01:49:55.465
Sadettin...

01:49:57.505 --> 01:49:59.305
if I was unaware of your long service...

01:50:00.745 --> 01:50:05.025
if I hadn't witnessed
your many great victories...

01:50:05.745 --> 01:50:07.785
I would crush you right now.

01:50:10.345 --> 01:50:15.185
Still you act like some poor
weak child in front of me.

01:50:16.625 --> 01:50:19.585
What bandit would dare to
ambush my margrave Ertuğrul,

01:50:20.105 --> 01:50:24.745
when he's riding off to war,
armed to the teeth?

01:50:25.545 --> 01:50:27.625
Can't you hear what you're saying?

01:50:28.425 --> 01:50:31.465
-My Sultan--
-And you still dare to make excuses!

01:50:37.065 --> 01:50:38.145
My Sultan...

01:50:39.225 --> 01:50:43.425
I interrogated many bandits,
I hanged a number of them.

01:50:44.385 --> 01:50:47.825
You still speak of bandits, Sadettin.

01:50:48.825 --> 01:50:50.865
Do you not realize the dogs
who attacked Ertuğrul...

01:50:51.825 --> 01:50:57.105
are the very same men
who attempted to kill me?

01:50:57.865 --> 01:51:00.345
Can you not see that
this assassination attempt,

01:51:00.985 --> 01:51:06.225
targeting both of us,
was the work of the same wretched demon?

01:51:08.105 --> 01:51:11.145
It did also cross my mind
that Nicaea and the Crusaders

01:51:11.225 --> 01:51:13.785
might be behind it, my Sultan, but--

01:51:13.985 --> 01:51:17.185
As long as the perpetrators go unpunished

01:51:17.625 --> 01:51:21.465
what good are you as an Emir?

01:51:24.425 --> 01:51:27.185
In Ertuğrul's absence
I charged you with this duty.

01:51:28.625 --> 01:51:30.745
What did you do? Nothing!

01:51:31.385 --> 01:51:33.105
Nothing at all!

01:51:33.945 --> 01:51:36.345
If that's what you think, my Sultan...

01:51:37.465 --> 01:51:40.305
you may take not only my title...

01:51:44.305 --> 01:51:47.145
but my worthless head too.

01:51:47.825 --> 01:51:49.225
Take my head now so that...

01:51:50.905 --> 01:51:55.305
instead of your rage eating away at you,
the crows may feast on my corpse.

01:51:56.425 --> 01:51:59.985
Even when I'm dead
I'd still wish to serve my state.

01:52:53.025 --> 01:52:56.745
Are you playing with me, Ertuğrul Bey?

01:52:58.265 --> 01:53:00.745
Do what you're going to do.

01:53:01.105 --> 01:53:02.945
You will talk first.

01:53:04.185 --> 01:53:07.665
You're going to admit
you're guilty of this treachery.

01:53:10.905 --> 01:53:15.105
I did nothing.

01:53:19.225 --> 01:53:20.185
Your alp...

01:53:21.785 --> 01:53:24.065
was the one who gave Esma the poison.

01:53:28.745 --> 01:53:31.065
Do you still deny it?

01:53:32.065 --> 01:53:34.585
Now is the time to show you're a man.

01:53:35.465 --> 01:53:38.345
Instead of denying it
like a coward, confess!

01:53:40.705 --> 01:53:43.705
I have nothing to confess.

01:53:45.905 --> 01:53:49.625
You think I did it but you're wrong.

01:53:50.225 --> 01:53:51.305
I swear...

01:53:52.105 --> 01:53:55.265
you'll pay a heavy price for this.

01:54:34.425 --> 01:54:37.985
If I hadn't sworn never
to leave the path of justice,

01:54:38.945 --> 01:54:40.065
I swear...

01:54:41.665 --> 01:54:43.985
I'd have done this
a long time before, Sadettin.

01:54:46.345 --> 01:54:48.865
You left me and my state...

01:54:50.505 --> 01:54:54.865
weakened against both the enemy
and the Turk tribes.

01:54:55.385 --> 01:54:58.225
Please, give me three months, my Sultan.

01:55:00.225 --> 01:55:05.145
I'll find out who was responsible
and bring you his head myself.

01:55:07.145 --> 01:55:08.345
I'll not only find them,

01:55:08.825 --> 01:55:12.225
I'll find the dogs
who infiltrated your palace as well.

01:55:14.985 --> 01:55:16.145
If I fail...

01:55:18.145 --> 01:55:19.705
I'll willingly pay the price.

01:55:20.465 --> 01:55:23.945
You claim the foreigners have eyes
inside the palace, Sadettin?

01:55:24.345 --> 01:55:26.385
If you're right...

01:55:26.985 --> 01:55:29.785
and the foreigners
were indeed responsible...

01:55:31.505 --> 01:55:34.225
they must have managed
to get inside the palace.

01:55:48.905 --> 01:55:52.945
This is your last chance, Sadettin,
understand?

01:55:54.825 --> 01:55:56.305
Now get out of my sight!

01:56:55.145 --> 01:56:56.145
My Sultan.

01:56:58.545 --> 01:57:01.825
I want Emir Sadettin followed
everywhere he goes.

01:57:02.145 --> 01:57:04.465
At all times.
I want to know everything he does.

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.225
As you command, my Sultan.

01:57:12.825 --> 01:57:16.265
Eminence, our informer sent us this.

01:57:36.625 --> 01:57:38.865
<i>Ertuğrul went to the priest's cave.</i>

01:57:39.065 --> 01:57:42.065
<i>He left two of his alps behind</i>
<i>then got back on the road.</i>

01:57:42.305 --> 01:57:46.185
<i>I believe he has taken the antidote</i>
<i>back to the Cavdar tribe.</i>

01:57:51.705 --> 01:57:52.665
Your Eminence!

01:58:25.025 --> 01:58:27.465
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:58:28.225 --> 01:58:29.705
Get well, sister.

01:58:34.785 --> 01:58:36.105
Thank you.

01:58:52.385 --> 01:58:54.345
-Turgut...
-Turgut Alp?

01:58:54.585 --> 01:58:57.265
-Thank God.
-My Turgut.

01:58:58.305 --> 01:58:59.225
My son!

01:59:07.145 --> 01:59:09.025
-Aslıhan...
-Turgut?

01:59:10.305 --> 01:59:11.505
At last.

01:59:18.145 --> 01:59:19.185
At last.

01:59:22.465 --> 01:59:23.345
Thank God!

01:59:26.145 --> 01:59:27.105
My son!

01:59:27.865 --> 01:59:29.185
Where is my Bey?

01:59:29.545 --> 01:59:30.785
He'll be here soon.

01:59:30.905 --> 01:59:32.385
You have to get better!

01:59:40.865 --> 01:59:42.305
Where's my Bey?

01:59:46.385 --> 01:59:51.385
Ertuğrul Bey is in his tent, Turgut Alp,
carrying out Bahadir Bey's sentence.

02:00:08.345 --> 02:00:10.745
-Son, you only just woke up.
-Turgut?

02:00:11.025 --> 02:00:12.945
-Lie back down.
-Where are you going, Turgut Alp?

02:00:13.225 --> 02:00:18.225
To kill the one... who tried to kill us!

02:00:21.345 --> 02:00:22.665
Son, wait!

02:00:23.985 --> 02:00:26.705
-My Bey.
-Brother Turgut got better.

02:00:26.905 --> 02:00:29.825
Turgut! My Turgut! Brother!

02:00:31.745 --> 02:00:34.825
Thank God! He spared your life.

02:00:40.105 --> 02:00:41.545
He did all this, my Bey.

02:00:43.425 --> 02:00:44.785
He did all this.

02:00:48.505 --> 02:00:50.185
He did everything.

02:00:52.105 --> 02:00:53.265
Everything.

02:00:55.105 --> 02:00:58.465
Don't worry. He'll be punished.

02:01:05.345 --> 02:01:10.745
My Bey. Let me make an example of him.

02:01:11.425 --> 02:01:15.345
Let me take his head in front of the tent.

02:01:18.465 --> 02:01:23.025
He hurt all of us,
but it must be me who takes his head.

02:01:26.785 --> 02:01:27.745
Believe me...

02:01:29.145 --> 02:01:31.705
every one of you is my enemy.

02:01:35.585 --> 02:01:39.265
Know that I don't fear death.

02:01:40.465 --> 02:01:44.585
But I did not poison you!

02:01:57.011 --> 02:02:00.371
I am not guilty of this treachery!

02:02:07.511 --> 02:02:08.711
Enough!

02:02:20.425 --> 02:02:21.625
What is it, Artuk Bey?

02:02:22.585 --> 02:02:23.705
Stop, my Bey.

02:02:52.265 --> 02:02:56.985
My Bey, Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut Alp
were not poisoned by Bahadir Bey.

02:02:58.665 --> 02:03:00.145
What are you saying, Artuk Bey?

02:03:00.745 --> 02:03:05.745
I found the poison given to the Sultan
in the cave of the herbalist, my Bey.

02:03:07.519 --> 02:03:09.559
-Are you sure?
-I am sure, my Bey.

02:03:11.759 --> 02:03:16.119
The poison that was given
to our sultan contained wolfsbane.

02:03:16.639 --> 02:03:21.399
Among other poisonous herbs.
I'm sure, my Bey. Absolutely sure.

02:03:23.599 --> 02:03:28.399
Bahadir wasn't here when
our sultan was poisoned.

02:03:29.839 --> 02:03:32.479
My Bey, whoever poisoned the sultan

02:03:32.639 --> 02:03:35.719
also poisoned Turgut Alp
and Aslıhan Hatun.

02:03:37.599 --> 02:03:41.759
This person used Esma and Bahadir's alp

02:03:42.479 --> 02:03:46.239
so that we would pin the blame on him.

02:03:48.959 --> 02:03:50.919
Only one person is capable of this.

02:04:19.266 --> 02:04:20.826
Emir Sadettin!
