00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 92 will start after 13:03 min.

14:18.155 --> 14:19.075
My God, what is this?

14:21.595 --> 14:23.355
Alps, take precautions!

14:43.635 --> 14:44.635
My God!

14:47.195 --> 14:48.315
My God!

15:03.955 --> 15:05.595
Artuk Bey is still breathing.

15:05.715 --> 15:07.115
Artuk Bey is still breathing.

15:07.195 --> 15:08.195
Artuk Bey.

15:08.595 --> 15:09.835
Hurry!

15:14.435 --> 15:16.555
Alps! Get here now!

15:17.195 --> 15:18.355
-Come on!
-Hurry!

15:18.475 --> 15:19.715
-Bring a stretcher.
-Hurry!

15:19.835 --> 15:20.955
Get him up.

15:21.515 --> 15:22.595
Come on, brothers.

15:24.115 --> 15:25.395
Come on.

15:26.475 --> 15:28.195
Come on.

15:31.955 --> 15:33.915
-Take him back to camp at once.
-Hold him.

15:35.075 --> 15:36.515
Come on.

15:46.635 --> 15:48.795
-Has anyone seen my bey?
-No.

15:50.915 --> 15:51.915
Ertuğrul.

15:54.595 --> 15:55.595
Where are you?

15:56.155 --> 15:58.075
Where are you, Ertuğrul?

16:04.715 --> 16:05.675
Be careful!

16:34.875 --> 16:35.875
Ertuğrul!

16:38.635 --> 16:39.635
Bamsi.

16:41.715 --> 16:42.835
Bamsi, my son.

16:44.835 --> 16:45.755
Bamsi.

16:46.595 --> 16:48.315
Bamsi.

16:49.995 --> 16:50.995
Dündar.

16:52.275 --> 16:53.275
Dündar.

16:54.715 --> 16:55.715
Get him up.

16:56.035 --> 16:57.355
Bamsi.

16:58.035 --> 16:59.035
My son.

17:00.195 --> 17:01.195
Bamsi.

17:01.795 --> 17:02.795
Bamsi.

17:17.355 --> 17:18.355
What?

17:24.915 --> 17:25.915
My boy.

17:26.035 --> 17:27.675
Open your eyes, my boy.

17:33.035 --> 17:34.115
Dündar.

17:35.035 --> 17:38.515
-Alps. Alps! Get a stretcher.
-Stretcher.

17:38.595 --> 17:40.395
Come on! Bring the stretcher!

17:41.355 --> 17:42.875
-Mother.
-Get him, quick.

17:45.635 --> 17:46.475
Mother.

17:48.595 --> 17:50.235
Take him back to camp, quickly.

17:50.715 --> 17:52.115
Come on.

17:52.595 --> 17:53.915
-Mother.
-Make haste.

17:54.075 --> 17:55.515
Mother, Ertuğrul isn't here.

17:56.235 --> 17:58.115
-My brave man isn't here, Mother.
-He isn't.

17:58.595 --> 17:59.675
He isn't.

17:59.835 --> 18:01.875
Ertuğrul, where are you, my son?

18:04.355 --> 18:06.835
-Where are you, Ertuğrul?
-We will find my brother.

18:07.275 --> 18:10.075
We will find him
if it's the last thing we do.

18:13.755 --> 18:15.915
-What did they do to you?
-Alps.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.955
You will search every inch of land.

18:20.555 --> 18:23.315
Look in every hollow tree,
leave no stone unturned.

18:23.755 --> 18:25.195
Send word to Aslıhan Hatun.

18:25.555 --> 18:27.835
Get to the Hanlı Bazaar
and tell Emir Sadettin.

18:28.035 --> 18:30.875
Tell them to come help us find
Ertuğrul Bey, come on.

18:31.075 --> 18:32.475
Send word to the sultan also.

18:32.955 --> 18:33.835
Come on!

18:34.995 --> 18:38.155
I'd die for you, my son Ertuğrul.

18:38.675 --> 18:40.715
Where are you Ertuğrul?

18:42.235 --> 18:43.235
Where are you?

19:04.115 --> 19:08.275
No other enemy has given me the pleasure
I got from having Ertuğrul in my grasp.

19:08.675 --> 19:11.115
Killing a foe such as Ertuğrul

19:11.435 --> 19:12.715
could only have been realized

19:12.835 --> 19:15.555
by a renowned knight
such as yourself, my lord.

19:16.275 --> 19:18.635
Ertuğrul's death
will be a lesson to all the Turks.

19:20.355 --> 19:22.435
Either they
get the hell out of Anatolia...

19:23.795 --> 19:26.075
or be put to the sword like Ertuğrul.

19:27.195 --> 19:30.875
Ertuğrul's death will no doubt
stir fear among all the Turks, my lord.

19:33.235 --> 19:36.435
They will really be afraid
when they find his body.

19:37.395 --> 19:39.515
My lord, his body hasn't been found yet.

19:42.195 --> 19:43.195
What do you mean?

19:44.315 --> 19:46.515
The Turks are searching
the site of the ambush.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.755
Our men are secretly watching.

19:49.195 --> 19:50.955
By the Turks or by us, Lukas,

19:52.195 --> 19:53.595
that body needs to be found.

19:54.115 --> 19:55.915
My lord, Ertuğrul is already dead.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.315
Why do you want to find his body so badly?

19:58.915 --> 20:02.155
We killed Ertuğrul, who was a great hero
for the Turks, Lukas.

20:03.195 --> 20:04.835
They need to see the body

20:04.955 --> 20:07.435
so they know
that their cause dies with him.

20:08.195 --> 20:10.595
Only then will they lose hope.

20:27.515 --> 20:28.715
Aslıhan Hatun.

20:36.395 --> 20:37.395
What is it, Kirca?

20:38.955 --> 20:40.875
Not good news I'm afraid, Aslıhan Hatun.

20:42.515 --> 20:43.515
Aslıhan Hatun,

20:43.795 --> 20:46.115
they ambushed Ertuğrul Bey
on the road to the campaign.

20:46.355 --> 20:48.555
They martyred the alps that were with him.

20:48.995 --> 20:50.675
Artuk Bey and Bamsi Alp
are heavily wounded.

20:50.915 --> 20:52.315
They took them to camp.

20:52.395 --> 20:53.875
What about Ertuğrul Bey?

20:54.355 --> 20:55.875
He hasn't been found yet.

20:56.115 --> 20:58.075
Hayme Hatun, Halime Hatun and Dündar Bey

20:58.315 --> 20:59.995
continue to search with the alps.

21:00.515 --> 21:01.875
Who would do this?

21:03.075 --> 21:04.355
We don't know, Aslıhan Hatun.

21:05.435 --> 21:07.995
Prepare the horses quickly.
We ride right away.

21:08.355 --> 21:09.635
Yes, Aslıhan Hatun.

21:38.835 --> 21:39.915
Your Eminence...

21:40.635 --> 21:42.315
Dündar Bey of the Kayi camp...

21:42.955 --> 21:44.515
has sent you a messenger, sir.

21:44.915 --> 21:46.195
Well, what does he say?

21:47.275 --> 21:48.515
They heard about the raid.

21:49.435 --> 21:51.315
They went to the site of Ares' ambush.

21:51.835 --> 21:53.395
They found the bodies of the alps.

21:53.875 --> 21:57.035
Bamsi and Artuk Bey were wounded
and taken to the camp.

21:57.515 --> 21:58.515
Ertuğrul?

22:05.475 --> 22:06.635
Speak, man.

22:07.115 --> 22:08.155
What of Ertuğrul?

22:10.675 --> 22:12.635
Ertuğrul hasn't been found yet, my Emir.

22:14.755 --> 22:17.035
They're searching for him, dead or alive.

22:17.355 --> 22:20.035
They ask for assistance in the search.

22:20.475 --> 22:22.715
They think Ertuğrul retreated
during a fight.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.515
I don't think

22:34.875 --> 22:37.435
Ertuğrul would have left his alps
and retreated, Göktuğ.

22:43.475 --> 22:45.075
And Ares wouldn't leave him alive.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.715
Send your men.

22:48.795 --> 22:50.075
Have them search for Ertuğrul.

22:50.955 --> 22:54.115
If they find him dead, good,
if he is alive...

22:54.515 --> 22:55.795
you know what to do.

22:56.995 --> 22:58.235
Tell Dündar Bey's alp

22:58.635 --> 23:01.475
to take us to the ambush site right away.

23:03.275 --> 23:04.275
Wait.

23:07.395 --> 23:09.555
Artuk and Bamsi are wounded?

23:11.395 --> 23:13.395
Call for the healer.
Send him to the tribe.

23:14.755 --> 23:16.675
If they know anything...

23:17.355 --> 23:18.795
let him do what is necessary.

23:21.155 --> 23:22.715
Yes, Your Eminence.

23:46.195 --> 23:47.195
What's happening?

23:48.515 --> 23:50.035
Hurry. Come on, quickly.

24:04.115 --> 24:05.115
Move.

24:13.995 --> 24:15.355
Who did this to our beys?

24:15.675 --> 24:16.675
Where is Ertuğrul Bey?

24:17.235 --> 24:18.515
How could this be?

24:28.275 --> 24:30.635
-Move.
-How could this be?

24:40.875 --> 24:41.875
Bamsi!

24:42.075 --> 24:43.075
Bamsi!

24:45.955 --> 24:47.155
Bamsi!

24:49.875 --> 24:50.875
Bamsi!

24:51.435 --> 24:53.235
Bamsi! Bamsi, what happened to you?

24:53.555 --> 24:56.075
Bamsi, who did this?

24:57.035 --> 24:58.835
Open your eyes. Bamsi!

24:59.435 --> 25:00.435
Bamsi!

25:04.755 --> 25:06.795
Bamsi! Bamsi, open your eyes!

25:07.755 --> 25:08.755
Bamsi!

25:09.395 --> 25:10.395
Where is Ertuğrul Bey?

25:10.555 --> 25:11.555
He is missing.

25:12.115 --> 25:13.395
Ishak. Where is Ishak?

25:13.635 --> 25:14.755
Ishak has been martyred.

25:18.035 --> 25:20.915
Who is going to heal them now?
There's nobody left.

25:21.555 --> 25:23.075
Artuk Bey, get up.

25:26.675 --> 25:27.675
Let go!

25:29.755 --> 25:31.155
Let go of me!

25:40.035 --> 25:41.995
-Towel.
-Brothers, some water.

25:42.315 --> 25:44.075
-Bring towels.
-Come on, quick!

25:44.595 --> 25:45.875
Bring towels.

25:47.475 --> 25:50.395
Bamsi, you are my man, my companion.

25:50.555 --> 25:52.195
Don't leave me alone!

25:53.595 --> 25:55.235
God, help us!

25:55.355 --> 25:56.715
Come on brothers, come on.

25:57.395 --> 25:59.075
Ertuğrul Bey!

25:59.315 --> 26:00.875
Ertuğrul Bey!

26:01.355 --> 26:03.835
Ertuğrul Bey!

26:04.595 --> 26:06.955
Ertuğrul Bey!

26:07.155 --> 26:08.835
Ertuğrul Bey!

26:09.195 --> 26:11.715
Ertuğrul Bey!

26:12.675 --> 26:14.915
Ertuğrul Bey!

26:15.875 --> 26:18.595
Ertuğrul Bey!

26:19.715 --> 26:21.555
Ertuğrul Bey!

26:22.275 --> 26:25.675
Ertuğrul Bey!

26:26.715 --> 26:29.435
Ertuğrul Bey!

26:33.155 --> 26:35.395
Bamsi, no, hang on Bamsi.

26:35.715 --> 26:36.835
It won't stop.

26:37.195 --> 26:38.275
We can't stop the bleeding.

26:38.795 --> 26:40.195
We need to cauterize it.

26:40.275 --> 26:42.555
Then do it.
What are you waiting for?

26:46.035 --> 26:47.115
Bamsi!

26:47.835 --> 26:49.715
Bamsi, hang on!

26:49.955 --> 26:50.875
Stop.

26:51.755 --> 26:52.755
Move.

26:54.515 --> 26:56.355
-Move.
-Who are you?

26:56.955 --> 26:57.995
The healer.

26:58.555 --> 27:00.195
The emir commissioned me.

27:00.835 --> 27:01.835
Everybody out.

27:06.475 --> 27:09.395
Thank God.

27:10.235 --> 27:12.475
-You'll be all right, Bamsi.
-I said, everybody out.

27:14.195 --> 27:16.515
I won't leave him. He is my man.

27:17.235 --> 27:18.235
No, woman.

27:18.715 --> 27:19.715
This is my job.

27:20.115 --> 27:21.795
Nobody must come in.

27:22.155 --> 27:24.075
Let me help you.

27:24.635 --> 27:26.675
I'll be right by my man's side.

27:26.915 --> 27:28.635
Or else I won't be at ease.

27:30.875 --> 27:31.875
Fine.

27:44.235 --> 27:45.795
Is he going to live?

27:45.995 --> 27:47.555
Please tell me he will.

27:49.595 --> 27:51.635
Look, you are my only hope.

27:51.995 --> 27:53.195
Please save him.

27:53.595 --> 27:54.995
Thank God, he's alive.

27:55.395 --> 27:57.715
We have to undress him
and cauterize his wounds.

27:59.835 --> 28:01.115
May God help us.

28:05.195 --> 28:07.315
Ertuğrul Bey!

28:07.595 --> 28:11.315
Ertuğrul Bey!

28:12.515 --> 28:13.835
Ertuğrul Bey!

28:14.675 --> 28:17.275
Ertuğrul Bey!

28:17.475 --> 28:20.315
Ertuğrul Bey!

28:21.515 --> 28:23.875
Ertuğrul Bey!

28:24.155 --> 28:26.955
Ertuğrul Bey!

28:27.395 --> 28:29.755
Ertuğrul Bey!

28:31.555 --> 28:34.315
Ertuğrul Bey!

29:00.395 --> 29:01.275
My bey.

29:01.915 --> 29:02.915
Bamsi.

29:04.555 --> 29:05.555
Bamsi.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.195
Forgive me, my bey.

29:09.995 --> 29:10.995
My bey.

29:12.395 --> 29:13.395
My bey.

29:14.795 --> 29:15.675
Bamsi.

29:17.035 --> 29:19.555
He's waking up. Thank God.

29:21.315 --> 29:22.635
Forgive me, my bey.

29:23.835 --> 29:25.235
I couldn't protect you, my bey.

29:26.035 --> 29:27.195
Bamsi, I am here.

29:28.155 --> 29:29.355
Tell me who did this.

29:30.035 --> 29:31.835
What traitors did this to you?

29:34.195 --> 29:35.195
I don't know.

29:37.315 --> 29:38.635
The infidels'...

29:39.875 --> 29:41.115
faces were covered.

30:07.115 --> 30:08.195
My bey!

30:08.275 --> 30:09.275
My bey!

30:38.515 --> 30:39.675
However,

30:39.835 --> 30:40.955
I wounded...

30:42.195 --> 30:43.395
their leader in the back.

30:43.715 --> 30:44.755
What about Ertuğrul Bey?

30:44.995 --> 30:46.315
Where is he?

30:47.915 --> 30:49.675
He was wounded too.

30:51.155 --> 30:52.275
He was wounded too.

31:05.515 --> 31:06.675
Kill them!

31:06.915 --> 31:08.355
Don't let them get away!

31:14.235 --> 31:15.115
My bey!

31:23.955 --> 31:24.955
My bey!

31:26.115 --> 31:27.115
My bey!

31:31.835 --> 31:32.755
My bey!

31:33.035 --> 31:34.355
My bey!

31:34.475 --> 31:36.675
Alps! Take our bey.

31:36.955 --> 31:38.755
My bey!

31:38.955 --> 31:41.555
Take him, alps! Take him!

31:45.435 --> 31:46.595
Two of our alps...

31:47.515 --> 31:48.755
took our bey away.

31:51.955 --> 31:53.595
-No!
-Brothers!

31:54.915 --> 31:56.275
How could they do this to you?

31:56.915 --> 31:58.195
How could they kill you?

32:12.635 --> 32:14.035
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

32:14.955 --> 32:17.115
<i>There are martyrs everywhere.</i>

32:17.915 --> 32:20.875
Where? Where did they take Ertuğrul Bey?

32:21.435 --> 32:23.035
Tell us so that we may help.

32:25.595 --> 32:26.595
I don't know.

32:28.235 --> 32:29.235
I don't know.

32:33.435 --> 32:34.355
Bamsi.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.875
Bamsi! Bamsi, wake up!

32:39.515 --> 32:40.675
Wake up, Bamsi!

32:40.875 --> 32:43.675
Woman, let's leave the wounded alone
for now.

32:43.875 --> 32:45.355
They need to rest.

32:46.715 --> 32:49.595
I have to tell Halime Hatun
what Bamsi told me.

32:50.835 --> 32:52.835
Their hearts suffer, just like mine.

32:53.155 --> 32:55.235
I have to get to them
before their hope runs out.

33:08.515 --> 33:12.035
Get what I'm about to say
to the emir at once.

33:28.275 --> 33:29.275
Come on.

33:32.755 --> 33:33.755
Come on.

33:50.995 --> 33:52.875
-Mother!
-Aslıhan.

33:53.235 --> 33:54.235
Mother!

33:56.595 --> 33:58.395
Halime, my sister.

34:04.795 --> 34:05.755
Sister.

34:09.035 --> 34:10.035
How could this be?

34:11.195 --> 34:12.195
Who did this?

34:13.475 --> 34:14.635
We don't know, my girl.

34:15.235 --> 34:16.915
We haven't found my son yet.

34:18.035 --> 34:19.235
Don't worry.

34:19.795 --> 34:20.915
We will, Hayme Ana.

34:21.675 --> 34:23.155
We will find our Ertuğrul Bey.

34:26.275 --> 34:28.195
We searched everywhere.

34:29.435 --> 34:33.275
We looked in every bird nest,
every ant nest.

34:34.835 --> 34:36.075
There is no trail.

34:39.795 --> 34:41.275
Nobody's hand...

34:42.355 --> 34:45.235
or power will suffice
in getting to our Ertuğrul Bey.

34:46.475 --> 34:47.675
We will find him, Halime.

34:48.715 --> 34:50.795
All my alps will look for him.

34:51.635 --> 34:52.675
We will find him.

34:54.475 --> 34:55.915
God bless you, Aslıhan.

35:33.155 --> 35:35.475
Göktuğ, tell the men

35:35.595 --> 35:37.875
to join the alps searching
for Ertuğrul Bey.

35:42.275 --> 35:45.475
Nobody comes back
until our Frontier Bey is found.

35:45.675 --> 35:47.195
Yes, Your Eminence.

35:58.315 --> 36:01.235
I came as soon as I heard.

36:02.675 --> 36:06.515
And I sent my healer
to tend to your wounded at the camp.

36:07.715 --> 36:10.715
My men will continue to search

36:11.155 --> 36:13.235
day and night until Ertuğrul Bey is found.

36:13.795 --> 36:14.795
I fear that

36:15.395 --> 36:18.115
the ones who did this may have
taken Ertuğrul Bey, Your Eminence.

36:20.315 --> 36:22.435
Our state and I...

36:23.715 --> 36:25.555
are behind you to the end.

36:26.355 --> 36:27.435
Rest assured.

36:28.435 --> 36:29.795
May God bless you.

36:31.835 --> 36:34.355
As my men look here for Ertuğrul Bey...

36:34.995 --> 36:36.435
I will personally go

36:36.875 --> 36:39.355
and question the people involved in this.

36:40.675 --> 36:42.795
To whoever dared to attempt this...

36:43.755 --> 36:46.275
let it be known
that it is my duty to find him.

37:15.635 --> 37:16.635
Dündar Bey!

37:22.395 --> 37:24.355
We found Ertuğrul Bey's armor.

37:24.675 --> 37:26.555
Ertuğrul Bey was nowhere near it.

37:33.595 --> 37:34.595
Brother.

37:40.715 --> 37:41.715
Ertuğrul!

37:46.395 --> 37:47.835
I'd die!

37:48.515 --> 37:49.555
Ertuğrul.

38:37.915 --> 38:39.755
We have done away with a fierce enemy.

38:40.475 --> 38:43.355
I raise my wine of victory
in honor of my knights.

38:52.515 --> 38:55.195
I will also hold a great feast
in celebration of this victory.

38:55.795 --> 38:56.755
However...

38:57.675 --> 39:00.515
I would like to show you something first.

39:43.835 --> 39:45.195
What is this sword, my lord?

39:49.435 --> 39:50.795
The sword of our enemy.

39:51.995 --> 39:53.755
A sword is very precious to a Turk.

39:57.435 --> 39:59.515
We sent Ertuğrul to hell.

40:00.315 --> 40:03.235
Now we will stamp
on his most cherished possession.

40:14.795 --> 40:16.315
This is the might of the knights.

40:21.195 --> 40:24.715
Long live Commander Ares!
The might of the knights!

40:27.395 --> 40:28.835
Just like this sword and its master,

40:28.995 --> 40:31.355
we will stamp on the Turks
and destroy them!

40:31.715 --> 40:35.675
We will stamp on the Turks
and destroy them!

40:36.195 --> 40:40.515
We will stamp on the Turks
and destroy them!

40:57.355 --> 41:00.635
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:01.435 --> 41:03.955
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:04.835 --> 41:07.115
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:07.435 --> 41:09.555
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:09.795 --> 41:12.475
-Ertuğrul Bey!
-Look under every stone!

41:13.155 --> 41:14.635
Look in every tree hollow!

41:15.035 --> 41:17.035
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:17.435 --> 41:18.435
My son...

41:18.915 --> 41:21.315
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:22.235 --> 41:24.955
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:26.075 --> 41:28.315
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:28.795 --> 41:30.635
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:30.875 --> 41:33.475
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:33.675 --> 41:36.315
We will continue to look until daybreak!

41:36.635 --> 41:40.715
-Ertuğrul Bey!
-We will not return until we find him!

41:43.435 --> 41:46.315
Ertuğrul Bey!

41:48.315 --> 41:50.115
-Mother Hayme!
-Mother!

41:50.915 --> 41:51.915
Mother Hayme!

41:52.595 --> 41:54.155
-Mother, it's Hafsa.
-Mother!

41:54.395 --> 41:56.235
Mother Hayme!

41:56.995 --> 41:58.195
What is it?

41:58.355 --> 42:01.035
Hafsa, what are you doing here, my girl?

42:01.275 --> 42:02.635
I have important news, Mother Hayme.

42:03.075 --> 42:06.035
-Speak, what is it?
-Bamsi opened his eyes.

42:06.115 --> 42:07.875
-Oh, thank God.
-Thank God.

42:08.435 --> 42:10.555
Did he say where Ertuğrul Bey was?

42:12.075 --> 42:14.235
They did not see who attacked them.

42:14.755 --> 42:15.995
Their faces were covered.

42:16.955 --> 42:20.595
Two alps took Ertuğrul Bey away.

42:23.355 --> 42:24.355
Mother...

42:25.355 --> 42:27.395
-The alps we saw.
-No.

42:27.875 --> 42:30.075
-Mother, if they are dead then--
-Halime!

42:30.475 --> 42:31.515
Get a hold of yourself!

42:32.275 --> 42:34.515
Get a hold of yourself!

42:36.115 --> 42:38.475
Let's pray first, my girl. Pray.

42:39.835 --> 42:41.675
Maybe they died

42:42.115 --> 42:43.755
after they hid their bey.

42:44.275 --> 42:45.395
Do you hear me?

42:45.875 --> 42:46.875
Listen to me!

42:47.515 --> 42:48.675
Mother!

42:49.555 --> 42:50.635
We won't give up.

42:51.275 --> 42:52.355
We'll find my son.

42:52.875 --> 42:53.875
We will!

42:54.915 --> 42:55.915
Come on.

42:57.395 --> 42:58.795
If they hid my brother...

43:00.235 --> 43:02.555
we should search in the vicinity
of where we found them.

43:02.715 --> 43:04.115
-Yes.
-You're right.

43:06.555 --> 43:07.555
Alps!

43:08.275 --> 43:10.595
We will look where we found the two alps.

43:11.275 --> 43:13.155
We will look everywhere!

43:13.235 --> 43:14.835
-Come on!
-Come on, alps!

43:14.955 --> 43:17.755
Ertuğrul Bey!

43:32.875 --> 43:36.155
Your Eminence, the healer you sent
to the Kayi tribe has sent word.

43:36.715 --> 43:39.595
-Well?
-Bamsi said that the assailants

43:39.755 --> 43:41.635
were bandits but didn't see their faces.

43:42.075 --> 43:44.875
He wounded their leader
in the back as he got away.

43:45.475 --> 43:46.475
Good.

43:47.755 --> 43:50.995
So, Ares took care of this silently.

43:51.755 --> 43:52.755
Well?

43:53.275 --> 43:55.235
Any news of Ertuğrul?

43:55.555 --> 43:57.475
He doesn't know where Ertuğrul is.

43:57.715 --> 44:01.075
He saw two alps take him away wounded.

44:01.595 --> 44:05.235
Göktuğ, until Ertuğrul is found,
dead or alive,

44:05.595 --> 44:06.795
we can't rest.

44:07.035 --> 44:09.155
Tell your men to be quick about it.

44:10.435 --> 44:11.955
Yes, Your Eminence.

44:32.635 --> 44:34.035
You summoned me.

44:34.635 --> 44:36.155
Permission to enter, my Sultan.

44:36.435 --> 44:37.435
Come.

44:49.395 --> 44:51.195
An alp brought word from your tribe.

44:53.835 --> 44:55.835
I have no knowledge of this, my Sultan.

44:58.555 --> 44:59.915
Ertuğrul Bey and his alps

45:00.355 --> 45:02.915
were ambushed and raided en route.

45:04.195 --> 45:05.395
They were raided?

45:07.075 --> 45:08.075
By who?

45:09.195 --> 45:10.555
Who ambushed them, my Sultan?

45:11.235 --> 45:12.915
That is not known.

45:14.635 --> 45:15.635
Unfortunately...

45:16.275 --> 45:17.595
many of the alps died.

45:20.435 --> 45:22.075
Only two survived but they are wounded.

45:24.075 --> 45:25.075
Ertuğrul Bey?

45:26.555 --> 45:27.595
Ertuğrul Bey is missing.

45:29.075 --> 45:30.235
There's no sign of him.

45:32.195 --> 45:34.275
The Kayis are looking for him everywhere.

45:37.275 --> 45:39.195
Now, it is my command to you...

45:42.555 --> 45:45.275
Take your alps
and go to your tribe immediately.

45:45.955 --> 45:46.995
Make inquiries.

45:48.595 --> 45:49.835
Find out what happened...

45:51.195 --> 45:53.115
and who set this trap.

45:54.715 --> 45:55.875
As you wish, my Sultan.

45:56.315 --> 45:57.355
Until you return...

45:58.075 --> 46:00.515
I will appoint a head alp in your place.

46:01.795 --> 46:03.515
You do as I say and...

46:04.435 --> 46:06.475
don't come back
without finding Ertuğrul Bey.

46:07.075 --> 46:08.075
This is your mission.

46:08.355 --> 46:09.675
But be careful.

46:10.755 --> 46:12.675
I wouldn't want you to be ambushed too.

46:15.875 --> 46:17.395
As you wish, my Sultan.

46:30.115 --> 46:32.635
Ertuğrul Bey!

46:33.755 --> 46:36.795
Ertuğrul Bey!

46:37.475 --> 46:39.635
Ertuğrul Bey!

46:40.195 --> 46:42.795
Ertuğrul Bey!

46:43.475 --> 46:45.875
Ertuğrul Bey!

46:46.395 --> 46:48.915
Ertuğrul Bey!

46:49.915 --> 46:52.875
Ertuğrul Bey!

46:53.395 --> 46:54.995
Ertuğrul Bey!

46:56.635 --> 46:57.515
Halime.

46:57.715 --> 46:59.195
Ertuğrul Bey!

46:59.395 --> 47:00.835
You've tired yourself out.

47:01.875 --> 47:04.075
I won't stop
until I overturn every rock...

47:05.035 --> 47:08.275
look in every hollow
in these mighty mountains.

47:09.835 --> 47:12.275
Mother Hayme,
we found a burnt body nearby!

47:12.435 --> 47:13.635
Burnt body?

47:15.435 --> 47:16.435
Come on.

47:19.515 --> 47:21.195
Come on.

48:03.475 --> 48:04.475
This...

48:05.355 --> 48:06.355
isn't Ertuğrul.

48:09.155 --> 48:10.155
It isn't.

48:19.395 --> 48:20.475
It's not my son.

48:27.635 --> 48:28.635
My God...

48:29.715 --> 48:32.395
don't give me more pain than I can bear.

49:23.915 --> 49:26.915
Ertuğrul!

49:29.195 --> 49:30.235
Ertuğrul!

49:33.755 --> 49:35.715
Ertuğrul!

49:38.035 --> 49:40.275
Brother!

49:52.795 --> 49:55.995
Mother! They burnt our heart!

49:56.355 --> 49:57.635
My boy!

49:58.395 --> 49:59.995
How could they do this?

50:09.275 --> 50:11.995
Ertuğrul!

50:12.115 --> 50:13.155
Brother!

50:15.275 --> 50:17.355
Ertuğrul!

51:00.875 --> 51:02.755
My lord, our men sent word.

51:03.275 --> 51:05.195
-Ertuğrul's body was found.
-Found?

51:06.115 --> 51:07.115
Who found it?

51:07.595 --> 51:08.715
The Kayi alps, my lord.

51:09.235 --> 51:10.915
They will take his body to the tribe.

51:14.795 --> 51:17.755
I wonder how they cried out
when they saw his body

51:17.835 --> 51:18.995
choked on his own blood.

51:19.355 --> 51:23.035
My lord, Ertuğrul did not choke on
his own blood, he was burned.

51:23.355 --> 51:24.355
Burned?

51:25.635 --> 51:26.635
Who burned him?

51:26.915 --> 51:27.915
We don't know, my lord.

51:28.515 --> 51:29.715
None of ours did.

51:29.995 --> 51:32.635
But don't worry. It is Ertuğrul for sure.

51:33.115 --> 51:35.595
The Kayi alps are sure
that it is Ertuğrul too.

51:38.955 --> 51:40.275
It doesn't matter who burned him.

51:41.755 --> 51:44.635
That rascal found hell
in this world too.

51:45.795 --> 51:47.075
Prepare a great feast, Lukas.

51:48.115 --> 51:49.595
Let the bells toll for three days.

51:50.315 --> 51:51.715
Invite everyone to the feast.

51:52.435 --> 51:54.835
And make preparations
for Ertuğrul's funeral.

51:55.155 --> 51:56.835
Yes, my lord.

51:57.435 --> 51:58.435
Door!

52:17.235 --> 52:18.715
Your Eminence.

52:20.355 --> 52:22.115
There is word from our men.

52:22.915 --> 52:24.835
They have found Ertuğrul's body at last.

52:27.115 --> 52:28.715
Thank you, God!

52:29.515 --> 52:30.675
I hope that tekfur

52:30.995 --> 52:32.595
wasn't stupid enough to leave a trace.

52:32.915 --> 52:35.475
There are no traces on him, Your Eminence.

52:35.835 --> 52:37.795
The body was burnt when they found him.

52:38.995 --> 52:39.995
Burnt?

52:40.515 --> 52:41.595
Yes, Your Eminence.

52:42.355 --> 52:44.915
They understood that it was Ertuğrul
from his bow ring.

52:58.115 --> 52:59.955
What a monster, that tekfur.

53:01.075 --> 53:02.715
As if it wasn't enough to kill him...

53:03.835 --> 53:04.915
he burned him too.

53:05.435 --> 53:06.875
What should we do, Your Eminence?

53:09.755 --> 53:11.755
The first thing we'll do...

53:12.955 --> 53:15.315
is attend Ertuğrul's funeral.

53:19.315 --> 53:20.635
What we'll actually do...

53:21.675 --> 53:23.475
will begin after the funeral.

54:58.714 --> 54:59.714
Bamsi...

55:00.234 --> 55:01.234
Bamsi...

55:02.794 --> 55:04.994
Who is it wrapped in a flagged
this time?

55:05.514 --> 55:07.594
Bamsi, please go inside. Come.

55:07.834 --> 55:09.914
Bamsi, stay with me. Bamsi!

55:10.554 --> 55:13.514
Bamsi. Please stop, stay with me.

55:16.354 --> 55:18.314
Stop!

55:19.514 --> 55:21.714
-Stop!
-Bamsi!

55:24.154 --> 55:25.234
No! Who is it?

55:25.714 --> 55:28.234
Who is it?

55:28.874 --> 55:30.354
-No!
-Bamsi...

55:32.354 --> 55:34.954
-Stop! Bamsi!
-No!

55:35.434 --> 55:39.114
Don't look!

55:39.514 --> 55:41.314
Don't look!

55:47.034 --> 55:49.554
-Mother...
-Don't...

55:52.674 --> 55:53.714
My son!

55:56.074 --> 55:58.394
-Mother Hayme!
-My son!

55:58.714 --> 56:00.594
Mother! Say he isn't.

56:03.154 --> 56:04.194
Say he isn't.

56:06.074 --> 56:07.234
Say he isn't.

56:08.234 --> 56:09.354
Say no.

56:13.274 --> 56:14.874
Say it is not our bey, Mother.

56:15.394 --> 56:17.834
My son!

56:19.514 --> 56:20.874
Say he isn't.

56:21.954 --> 56:22.994
Say no.

56:23.794 --> 56:24.794
Say no.

56:25.114 --> 56:26.114
Say no.

56:26.474 --> 56:28.554
Fire can't burn our bey. Say it.

56:28.914 --> 56:30.194
Say it.

56:32.194 --> 56:34.634
He died in the name of Allah.

56:35.114 --> 56:38.234
Fire doesn't burn a hero of Allah. Say it.

56:38.914 --> 56:40.074
My son!

57:09.394 --> 57:10.394
Bey!

57:11.914 --> 57:15.074
I couldn't shield you as an alp.

57:15.394 --> 57:17.514
I couldn't save you as a brother, Bey.

57:18.354 --> 57:20.434
I wish I had choked on my bread,

57:21.034 --> 57:22.674
I wish my eyes were covered with blood

57:23.194 --> 57:26.634
so I didn't have to see you like this.

57:26.794 --> 57:32.394
Is this how I have to see you
after awaiting your victory?

57:38.674 --> 57:39.674
Mother!

57:39.954 --> 57:41.754
Mother! Mother!

57:49.394 --> 57:50.994
Is this my father?

58:37.674 --> 58:38.514
Bamsi?

58:39.194 --> 58:40.554
Bamsi, who is this?

58:42.914 --> 58:44.034
Who is this Bamsi?

58:46.914 --> 58:48.194
It is Bey!

58:49.834 --> 58:50.714
Turgut!

58:52.154 --> 58:53.194
Turgut.

58:53.994 --> 58:56.834
Turgut! No fire can burn our bey, Brother.

58:57.754 --> 58:59.354
No fire can burn our bey, Brother.

59:14.194 --> 59:15.554
Did they burn my bey?

59:38.394 --> 59:39.394
Alps.

59:46.914 --> 59:48.474
I won't let him go.

59:48.834 --> 59:49.914
My child.

59:50.394 --> 59:51.754
Bey!

59:54.394 --> 59:55.394
My son!

59:56.234 --> 59:58.234
My son!

01:00:05.674 --> 01:00:06.594
Bey!

01:01:27.874 --> 01:01:29.594
Long live Commander Ares!

01:01:29.714 --> 01:01:31.314
Long live Commander Ares!

01:01:31.514 --> 01:01:33.074
Long live Commander Ares!

01:01:33.194 --> 01:01:34.834
Long live Commander Ares!

01:01:35.034 --> 01:01:36.514
Long live Commander Ares!

01:01:36.714 --> 01:01:38.354
Long live Commander Ares!

01:02:01.194 --> 01:02:02.834
Let them have fun until morning, Lukas.

01:02:03.994 --> 01:02:06.954
Let them keep on drinking
until Ertuğrul is laying underground.

01:02:08.074 --> 01:02:10.114
Today is the happiest day in Karacahisar.

01:02:11.114 --> 01:02:12.594
Yes, sir.

01:02:37.674 --> 01:02:38.674
Sir,

01:02:39.034 --> 01:02:40.394
this is slave trader Simko.

01:02:41.314 --> 01:02:42.674
I know him from Nicaea.

01:02:43.074 --> 01:02:44.394
He is a very famous trader.

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:47.634
He wants to have
the distinct honor of meeting you.

01:03:02.554 --> 01:03:04.314
Greetings, Commander Ares.

01:03:07.914 --> 01:03:12.634
I heard that you allow beautiful slaves
to join this wonderful feast of yours.

01:03:13.274 --> 01:03:16.674
So, here I am
with all my beautiful slaves.

01:03:17.314 --> 01:03:21.474
Because there would be no better chance
for me to meet you.

01:03:25.594 --> 01:03:27.034
Why do you want to meet me?

01:03:28.074 --> 01:03:30.914
People praise the trade here

01:03:31.234 --> 01:03:32.994
and I'm planning to do trade here.

01:03:33.274 --> 01:03:34.714
But to do this,

01:03:35.034 --> 01:03:38.274
I should meet
a powerful landlord like yourself

01:03:38.674 --> 01:03:40.794
and collaborate.

01:03:42.394 --> 01:03:43.954
You look like a smart trader.

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:46.074
Thank you, Tekfur Ares.

01:03:46.674 --> 01:03:50.674
I have a small present for you
in honor of our meeting.

01:03:51.114 --> 01:03:54.034
If you wish,
I would like to present it to you.

01:04:43.274 --> 01:04:45.554
Before his forty days have passed,

01:04:46.034 --> 01:04:48.994
we have to avenge him!

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:52.314
We have to.

01:04:56.314 --> 01:04:58.074
Help me, God!

01:06:43.914 --> 01:06:46.994
Looking at the slaves you have Simko,
it is obvious you're a good slave trader.

01:07:04.434 --> 01:07:06.714
This beauty is Marya.

01:07:07.354 --> 01:07:09.634
We call her, Mermaid.

01:07:10.154 --> 01:07:12.114
Immaculate, innocent

01:07:12.874 --> 01:07:15.514
and a rosebud.

01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:35.474
Mermaid, huh?

01:07:40.994 --> 01:07:41.994
Beautiful.

01:07:42.834 --> 01:07:43.914
Very beautiful.

01:07:46.314 --> 01:07:50.274
As the start of our good collaboration,

01:07:51.074 --> 01:07:52.074
I kindly

01:07:52.594 --> 01:07:55.554
ask you to accept this beauty
as my present.

01:07:57.794 --> 01:08:02.234
Only the wise traders think of presenting
such a precious thing.

01:08:03.314 --> 01:08:05.434
It is clear that
you're a good trader Simko.

01:08:06.754 --> 01:08:08.034
I like your generosity.

01:08:09.914 --> 01:08:12.674
And I always need good traders.

01:08:13.314 --> 01:08:17.474
Clearly, we won't have any difficulty
building good relations.

01:08:18.754 --> 01:08:22.194
It's a great honor for me, Tekfur Ares.

01:08:22.834 --> 01:08:23.834
Lukas!

01:08:24.354 --> 01:08:27.754
Settle my present in a comfortable room,
she will rest until tomorrow.

01:08:29.394 --> 01:08:33.474
I'll go on feasting tomorrow with Marya,
after Ertuğrul's funeral.

01:08:47.634 --> 01:08:48.954
Go, come on.

01:08:52.474 --> 01:08:53.794
Where?

01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:56.474
Where are you going?

01:09:01.154 --> 01:09:02.154
How...

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:05.514
did they throw you into the fire, Bey?

01:09:07.754 --> 01:09:09.474
How did they do away with you?

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:12.314
Bey...

01:09:13.554 --> 01:09:15.234
We are all burning inside.

01:09:16.074 --> 01:09:19.274
And thinking that the bey was burned
by these daemon bastards...

01:09:21.274 --> 01:09:22.554
burns us a thousand times.

01:09:28.074 --> 01:09:29.074
This happened...

01:09:30.354 --> 01:09:31.674
because of me.

01:09:31.994 --> 01:09:33.874
You are not to blame, Brother Bamsi.

01:09:35.514 --> 01:09:37.634
Turgut Alp is right.

01:09:39.594 --> 01:09:40.594
Now,

01:09:41.234 --> 01:09:42.234
it is time...

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:45.194
to keep the hand on the sword.

01:09:51.314 --> 01:09:53.874
Those who think of anything but revenge,

01:09:54.714 --> 01:09:55.954
may they be ruined!

01:09:58.514 --> 01:09:59.634
After...

01:10:00.754 --> 01:10:02.554
Ertuğrul Bey is buried...

01:10:06.674 --> 01:10:07.674
it is time...

01:10:08.434 --> 01:10:09.674
to disregard our lives

01:10:10.234 --> 01:10:11.954
and to face death!

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:13.274
Yes!

01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:15.154
Revenge is honor!

01:10:15.474 --> 01:10:18.754
And we owe this honor to our bey
and to our tent!

01:10:20.354 --> 01:10:23.194
He who runs from his debt,
may he drown in blood!

01:10:23.514 --> 01:10:25.074
Yes!

01:10:40.514 --> 01:10:41.554
From now on...

01:10:44.354 --> 01:10:46.354
it is your duty...

01:10:48.074 --> 01:10:50.274
to look after the tent...

01:10:52.754 --> 01:10:54.714
and to avenge your brother.

01:10:55.994 --> 01:10:56.994
Therefore...

01:10:58.114 --> 01:10:59.594
no later than tomorrow...

01:11:01.554 --> 01:11:02.994
gather the beylic council.

01:11:05.074 --> 01:11:06.634
Our law orders this.

01:11:17.594 --> 01:11:18.594
Gündüz.

01:11:30.914 --> 01:11:31.914
Come, Gündüz.

01:11:32.594 --> 01:11:34.154
Come, my brother's lion.

01:11:36.714 --> 01:11:37.714
Halime.

01:11:38.234 --> 01:11:40.434
Halime, don't cry in front of the child.

01:11:41.434 --> 01:11:43.834
We've perished, don't let him perish too.

01:11:45.194 --> 01:11:48.314
I thought I saw Ertuğrul
when I saw him by the door.

01:11:51.354 --> 01:11:52.834
Father, wake up, Father!

01:11:54.674 --> 01:11:55.834
Come on, Father!

01:12:01.994 --> 01:12:03.434
Gündüz, my nephew.

01:12:04.114 --> 01:12:05.954
Let's go to your brother.

01:12:06.034 --> 01:12:07.034
I won't!

01:12:07.394 --> 01:12:08.954
Father, come on, wake up, Father.

01:12:09.834 --> 01:12:11.034
Don't.

01:12:11.554 --> 01:12:12.874
Don't, my son.

01:12:13.034 --> 01:12:15.834
I'd die for you, don't Gündüz.

01:12:21.954 --> 01:12:23.074
Father, wake up.

01:12:23.274 --> 01:12:26.194
God, how do I console this little child?

01:12:27.314 --> 01:12:30.394
Mercy, God. Mercy.

01:12:53.394 --> 01:12:54.714
The Oghuz insignia,

01:12:56.114 --> 01:12:57.914
these three arrows and the bow,

01:12:59.554 --> 01:13:01.514
would have ruled of the world.

01:13:03.834 --> 01:13:07.034
Now they are the insignia
of your funeral, Son.

01:13:31.834 --> 01:13:33.114
My condolences.

01:14:29.754 --> 01:14:33.354
Did the earth bare its heart
for my son, Turgut?

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:38.674
It did, Mother.

01:14:40.954 --> 01:14:44.234
We come and go in this world

01:14:45.794 --> 01:14:48.194
and find death in the end.

01:14:51.114 --> 01:14:54.194
I envy Mother Earth for taking my man.

01:14:56.114 --> 01:14:59.474
How can Earth cover you, Ertuğrul?

01:15:00.314 --> 01:15:02.594
How can the earth keep you?

01:15:04.714 --> 01:15:07.234
Ertuğrul!

01:15:08.074 --> 01:15:09.474
How can death

01:15:09.994 --> 01:15:11.554
come for a valiant man like you?

01:15:12.634 --> 01:15:14.474
How can the earth hide you?

01:15:19.194 --> 01:15:21.674
The mighty world has become lonely.

01:15:22.194 --> 01:15:24.434
The mighty universe has become lonely.

01:15:26.754 --> 01:15:27.754
Come.

01:15:28.354 --> 01:15:29.354
My hero!

01:15:30.434 --> 01:15:32.834
The mighty universe has become lonely.

01:15:37.114 --> 01:15:38.114
My hero!

01:15:46.554 --> 01:15:47.994
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim</i>.

01:15:50.194 --> 01:15:51.194

I'll avenge you, Father.

01:16:29.874 --> 01:16:31.154
I'll avenge you.

01:16:33.634 --> 01:16:35.194
I'm giving you the word of an alp.

01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:38.914
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:17:09.874 --> 01:17:11.514
Come to the salaah for Allah.

01:17:12.514 --> 01:17:15.514
Come to the salawat for our Prophet.

01:17:16.594 --> 01:17:18.594
Come to pray for the funeral.

01:17:19.834 --> 01:17:22.274
And I will follow the imam

01:17:22.994 --> 01:17:24.634
intended for a man.

01:17:35.074 --> 01:17:37.074
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:17:46.474 --> 01:17:48.274
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:19:07.834 --> 01:19:08.834
Ertuğrul Bey,

01:19:09.394 --> 01:19:10.634
I swear to God...

01:19:11.794 --> 01:19:16.194
If we cannot avenge you,

01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:19.474
may my sword tear me apart

01:19:20.554 --> 01:19:23.474
and be washed with my blood!

01:19:23.754 --> 01:19:29.434
Tear me apart, washed with blood!

01:19:29.634 --> 01:19:35.114
Tear me apart, washed with blood!

01:19:35.314 --> 01:19:42.234
Tear me apart, washed with blood!

01:20:20.794 --> 01:20:22.354
I came here as your neighbor.

01:20:24.074 --> 01:20:25.074
Sorry for your loss.

01:20:28.354 --> 01:20:29.354
Ertuğrul Bey...

01:20:30.914 --> 01:20:31.914
was a brave warrior,

01:20:32.674 --> 01:20:33.794
a glorious commander.

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:37.514
We are all sad about what happened.

01:20:38.314 --> 01:20:40.554
I want you to know,
I am always here for you.

01:20:43.354 --> 01:20:44.354
Thank you.

01:21:17.954 --> 01:21:19.394
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:19.514 --> 01:21:20.834
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:20.954 --> 01:21:22.234
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:22.354 --> 01:21:23.594
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:23.914 --> 01:21:24.954
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:25.114 --> 01:21:26.314
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:26.434 --> 01:21:27.754
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:27.874 --> 01:21:29.114
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:29.274 --> 01:21:30.554
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:30.634 --> 01:21:31.954
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:32.074 --> 01:21:33.194
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:33.434 --> 01:21:34.594
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:34.754 --> 01:21:36.034
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:21:36.394 --> 01:21:37.834
After Ertuğrul’s death,

01:21:38.234 --> 01:21:39.834
I hope the Seljuk State

01:21:39.994 --> 01:21:42.474
follows politics which will ease
the tension in the margraves.

01:21:44.754 --> 01:21:46.594
I decide the politics here.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:50.554
Don't you worry.

01:21:50.634 --> 01:21:52.074
From now on, our politics

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:56.394
won't be fed by tension,
but by mutual benefit.

01:21:58.234 --> 01:22:00.514
I am very glad to hear that,
Emir Sadettin.

01:22:01.954 --> 01:22:04.954
I'd like to reap the reward
of these politics.

01:22:06.634 --> 01:22:08.674
Those fruits are not ripe yet.

01:22:09.394 --> 01:22:10.754
But soon they will be.

01:22:11.794 --> 01:22:13.314
Wait for my word.

01:22:19.274 --> 01:22:20.594
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:22:20.674 --> 01:22:21.914
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:22:22.074 --> 01:22:23.314
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:22:23.474 --> 01:22:24.714
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:22:24.874 --> 01:22:26.114
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:23:55.354 --> 01:23:57.034
Brave beys...

01:23:58.194 --> 01:23:59.594
devoted mothers...

01:24:01.594 --> 01:24:03.154
children who will be Kayi alps.

01:24:06.514 --> 01:24:07.714
We can't break...

01:24:08.834 --> 01:24:10.794
from one gust of wind.

01:24:12.034 --> 01:24:13.034
We can't perish...

01:24:14.154 --> 01:24:16.314
in one hurricane.

01:24:18.314 --> 01:24:19.434
We...

01:24:19.914 --> 01:24:21.674
can't be defeated by one thunderstorm.

01:24:24.634 --> 01:24:26.394
Our tears...

01:24:27.834 --> 01:24:30.594
our pain and our sweat...

01:24:32.114 --> 01:24:33.434
are soaked into these lands.

01:24:35.354 --> 01:24:37.194
We have a cause!

01:24:40.794 --> 01:24:41.954
Whoever...

01:24:43.314 --> 01:24:44.714
believes in Ertuğrul Bey...

01:24:46.354 --> 01:24:47.994
and admires him...

01:24:49.274 --> 01:24:51.834
should know that

01:24:52.594 --> 01:24:54.554
they are a martyr for their cause.

01:24:59.914 --> 01:25:00.914
Whoever...

01:25:02.114 --> 01:25:05.954
believes in the cause of mighty Allah,

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:08.554
or admires Allah,

01:25:09.434 --> 01:25:11.394
should know that this cause

01:25:12.194 --> 01:25:14.114
will live and will continue to live

01:25:14.714 --> 01:25:16.474
until the Judgment Day.

01:25:21.954 --> 01:25:25.154
Anyone wants to praise
Ertuğrul Bey's soul,

01:25:25.674 --> 01:25:26.794
gather yourself

01:25:27.674 --> 01:25:29.954
and support this cause.

01:25:31.234 --> 01:25:32.234
For...

01:25:33.274 --> 01:25:34.274
it is time...

01:25:35.514 --> 01:25:37.034
for revenge.

01:25:41.354 --> 01:25:42.394
An eye for an eye...

01:25:43.834 --> 01:25:44.794
a tooth for a tooth.

01:25:46.594 --> 01:25:49.194
-Revenge!
-Revenge!

01:25:49.434 --> 01:25:54.634
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

01:25:54.794 --> 01:26:01.554
Revenge! Revenge! Revenge!

01:26:01.954 --> 01:26:04.194
Revenge! Revenge!

01:26:04.754 --> 01:26:06.794
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:26:07.114 --> 01:26:08.394
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:26:08.674 --> 01:26:09.874
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:26:09.954 --> 01:26:11.194
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:26:11.354 --> 01:26:12.594
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:26:12.874 --> 01:26:14.114
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:26:14.234 --> 01:26:15.434
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:26:16.034 --> 01:26:17.114
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:26:17.474 --> 01:26:20.434
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:27:28.594 --> 01:27:29.714
Who are you?

01:27:42.634 --> 01:27:43.994
We are the Bozok Tribe...

01:27:44.914 --> 01:27:45.914
of Oghuz.

01:27:46.674 --> 01:27:49.314
From Otuken, the Mountains of Heaven.

01:27:50.234 --> 01:27:51.754
Joy to you, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:55.554
This child shining in your white tent,

01:27:56.314 --> 01:27:58.274
is your son Osman.

01:28:09.994 --> 01:28:11.314
May his guide be the Quran

01:28:12.394 --> 01:28:15.394
and the sunnah of our mighty Prophet.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:28.034
May his law be the law of my Oghuz father.

01:29:14.314 --> 01:29:16.954
We are the Ucok Tribe of Oghuz,

01:29:17.434 --> 01:29:20.514
come down from the Altai Mountains,
washed in the Orkhon River.

01:29:20.994 --> 01:29:22.634
Joy to you, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:29:23.074 --> 01:29:25.034
This child shining in your lovely tent

01:29:25.754 --> 01:29:27.514
is your son Osman.

01:29:36.234 --> 01:29:37.314
May his sword be strong,

01:29:37.594 --> 01:29:39.314
his cause be just.

01:29:47.514 --> 01:29:48.834
The nine fringed aigrette

01:29:49.114 --> 01:29:50.794
that our...

01:29:51.594 --> 01:29:53.754
world-conquering Khagans carried...

01:29:54.954 --> 01:29:56.154
may be his destiny...

01:29:57.234 --> 01:29:59.114
and may be the insignia
of the World State.

01:29:59.514 --> 01:30:00.514
Ertuğrul Bey,

01:30:01.194 --> 01:30:02.474
the key to the united state

01:30:02.714 --> 01:30:04.794
that will be created by your son

01:30:05.154 --> 01:30:06.434
is in your hand.

01:30:07.074 --> 01:30:08.714
First of all, stay alive,

01:30:09.834 --> 01:30:11.914
have your revenge upon your enemies.

01:30:12.994 --> 01:30:15.394
Bring order to the lands.

01:30:16.394 --> 01:30:18.674
Then, you will see your son Osman

01:30:19.394 --> 01:30:20.514
before you die.

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:41.754
With the oath of my Oghuz father,

01:30:42.634 --> 01:30:44.074
armed with bow and shield,

01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:46.914
may we be branded with merit.

01:30:47.834 --> 01:30:50.834
May our iron spikes be so numerous
that they seem like a forest.

01:30:52.594 --> 01:30:54.834
It is in the sea,
it is in the brook.

01:30:58.474 --> 01:31:01.554
May the sky be our tent,
the sun be our flag.

01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:03.194
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:31:03.434 --> 01:31:04.754
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:31:04.954 --> 01:31:06.274
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:31:06.434 --> 01:31:07.434
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:31:07.834 --> 01:31:09.354
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:31:09.434 --> 01:31:10.714
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:31:10.914 --> 01:31:12.234
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:31:12.394 --> 01:31:13.834
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

01:31:16.034 --> 01:31:17.034
Osman.

01:31:41.194 --> 01:31:42.274
Osman.

01:32:24.114 --> 01:32:25.274
My Osman.

01:32:31.394 --> 01:32:33.394
What will we do?

01:32:34.994 --> 01:32:36.194
We buried...

01:32:37.154 --> 01:32:38.194
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:32:38.914 --> 01:32:39.914
Now,

01:32:40.634 --> 01:32:43.874
immediately,
we need to gather together.

01:32:44.634 --> 01:32:47.394
The position of bey should be filled

01:32:47.874 --> 01:32:49.394
so as not to leave our tent

01:32:50.394 --> 01:32:51.714
and our alps unattended.

01:32:52.194 --> 01:32:53.794
He is right.

01:32:54.194 --> 01:32:56.394
We should designate a new bey.

01:32:56.834 --> 01:32:59.394
Therefore, I...

01:33:01.034 --> 01:33:02.954
Dündar Bey, son of Suleyman Shah...

01:33:04.914 --> 01:33:05.914
seek to be...

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:08.594
bey of the Kayi tribe...

01:33:09.434 --> 01:33:11.394
and carry on Ertuğrul Bey's cause...

01:33:14.354 --> 01:33:15.354
where he left off.

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:21.034
With God's grace...

01:33:22.074 --> 01:33:23.434
avenging him is my duty.

01:33:24.514 --> 01:33:26.274
Know that.

01:33:26.714 --> 01:33:28.514
You are the only choice to be the bey

01:33:28.714 --> 01:33:30.274
in Suleyman Shah's marquee.

01:33:30.834 --> 01:33:32.234
Ertuğrul Bey's cause

01:33:32.954 --> 01:33:34.994
must be carried on by his own blood.

01:33:35.434 --> 01:33:37.114
Agreed.

01:33:38.234 --> 01:33:39.474
Agreed.

01:33:40.274 --> 01:33:42.034
So the beys are agreed,

01:33:42.554 --> 01:33:43.874
beylic insignias

01:33:44.874 --> 01:33:46.314
should be worn.

01:33:46.674 --> 01:33:48.554
She's right.

01:35:54.302 --> 01:35:55.182
On the book,

01:35:55.782 --> 01:35:56.782
on the flag,

01:35:57.782 --> 01:35:58.782
and on the sword,

01:35:59.542 --> 01:36:00.542
I swear.

01:36:04.222 --> 01:36:05.262
If I leave

01:36:06.022 --> 01:36:07.302
the path of my faith,

01:36:08.302 --> 01:36:10.062
my tradition and of my brother,

01:36:11.182 --> 01:36:12.182
may I be killed

01:36:12.822 --> 01:36:14.222
with my own sword

01:36:15.382 --> 01:36:16.862
for the Qur'an and our flag.

01:37:06.542 --> 01:37:07.742
Oh, Ertuğrul...

01:37:08.342 --> 01:37:09.342
Oh...

01:37:10.302 --> 01:37:13.302
You have disobeyed the state
and its powerful emir

01:37:13.622 --> 01:37:15.262
for many years.

01:37:15.862 --> 01:37:18.782
He tried to undermine every decision
you made, Your Highness.

01:37:19.502 --> 01:37:20.582
Yes, and now what?

01:37:22.942 --> 01:37:24.742
He filled his own grave.

01:37:25.422 --> 01:37:26.542
The Sultan rules us.

01:37:27.342 --> 01:37:28.342
But

01:37:28.462 --> 01:37:31.102
I rule here. He couldn't understand that.

01:37:36.942 --> 01:37:38.862
He won't rest in peace.

01:37:39.342 --> 01:37:41.022
I'll send his village

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:43.142
to the place they came.

01:37:44.102 --> 01:37:46.822
I'll create a new order in these lands,
where even

01:37:47.222 --> 01:37:48.662
his grave will be forgotten.

01:37:49.822 --> 01:37:52.542
Ares left smiling, Your Highness.

01:37:53.902 --> 01:37:55.542
You'll see how he smiles

01:37:55.902 --> 01:37:57.902
when he hears my offer

01:37:58.102 --> 01:37:59.942
after the mourning.

01:38:00.542 --> 01:38:01.702
No doubt, sir.

01:38:04.462 --> 01:38:06.822
Your Highness, the council will end soon.

01:38:13.742 --> 01:38:15.302
Dündar Bey is at the tent.

01:38:16.262 --> 01:38:17.942
This council is just a charade,

01:38:19.182 --> 01:38:20.542
and I'll be the winner.

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:24.622
I'll put such a tight leash
on Dündar that...

01:38:25.662 --> 01:38:27.462
whatever Ertuğrul owned,

01:38:28.182 --> 01:38:29.822
whatever he took from me,

01:38:30.502 --> 01:38:31.582
will be mine again.

01:38:32.582 --> 01:38:33.582
But,

01:38:33.862 --> 01:38:35.262
our issue is Turgut Alp.

01:38:36.862 --> 01:38:37.982
What is he doing?

01:38:38.422 --> 01:38:41.062
He stays here
and is provoking the alps

01:38:41.182 --> 01:38:43.062
to avenge Ertuğrul, sir.

01:38:44.742 --> 01:38:46.022
Send him to me.

01:38:46.782 --> 01:38:47.862
We buried Ertuğrul.

01:38:48.662 --> 01:38:50.022
He has a grave.

01:38:50.622 --> 01:38:52.342
Where I'll send Turgut, he won't

01:38:52.822 --> 01:38:54.742
even find soil to be buried under.

01:39:07.582 --> 01:39:11.062
What, are you hungry? Here you go.

01:39:13.982 --> 01:39:16.462
Is there no water? Give us water.

01:39:17.542 --> 01:39:18.542
Water?

01:39:26.742 --> 01:39:29.222
Give them water. Here you go. Water.

01:39:29.462 --> 01:39:31.262
Please give us water.

01:39:38.702 --> 01:39:39.702
Here you go.

01:39:40.902 --> 01:39:42.342
Water!

01:39:42.742 --> 01:39:44.702
Give us water. Just a little.

01:39:49.102 --> 01:39:50.102
Tell me.

01:39:50.302 --> 01:39:51.582
Is Ertuğrul going to live?

01:39:52.062 --> 01:39:54.582
His anger will keep him alive,
don't worry.

01:39:56.702 --> 01:39:57.742
What happened?

01:39:58.462 --> 01:39:59.462
Tell me everything.

01:39:59.902 --> 01:40:02.142
If you left even the slightest trace
that you were there,

01:40:02.702 --> 01:40:04.622
we'll pay with our lives.

01:40:05.462 --> 01:40:07.382
Commander Ares ambushed Ertuğrul

01:40:07.702 --> 01:40:09.622
and his men
dressed as a bandit.

01:40:10.222 --> 01:40:11.582
Lots of blood.

01:40:12.142 --> 01:40:15.142
Kill them. Don't let them escape!

01:40:16.182 --> 01:40:18.862
<i>When Ares was injured,</i>
<i>I saw his face.</i>

01:40:22.462 --> 01:40:23.902
So Ares

01:40:24.582 --> 01:40:27.622
wanted to get rid of Ertuğrul Bey
before making peace

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:30.022
with the Turks.

01:40:35.182 --> 01:40:36.582
But how did Ertuğrul escape?

01:40:38.582 --> 01:40:40.662
Two injured alps took him away.

01:40:42.142 --> 01:40:43.702
My bey! Hang on, my bey!

01:40:44.062 --> 01:40:45.862
<i>I followed them.</i>

01:40:46.582 --> 01:40:47.662
<i>Almost there, hang on.</i>

01:40:48.222 --> 01:40:49.822
My bey. Hang on my bey.

01:40:53.022 --> 01:40:54.542
Almost there, my Bey. Hang on.

01:40:54.742 --> 01:40:55.742
Please hang on!

01:40:57.182 --> 01:40:58.182
They're coming!

01:40:59.342 --> 01:41:00.342
Hang on.

01:41:18.702 --> 01:41:21.702
<i>His alps gave their life</i>
<i>for Ertuğrul.</i>

01:41:22.702 --> 01:41:25.502
<i>And so they handed</i>
<i>Ertuğrul to me.</i>

01:41:31.502 --> 01:41:33.782
And his body?

01:41:34.662 --> 01:41:35.902
How did you convince his family

01:41:36.582 --> 01:41:37.662
and the alps that he had died?

01:41:39.462 --> 01:41:41.302
<i>I put Ertuğrul's ring</i>

01:41:41.382 --> 01:41:43.662
on one of Ares' men

01:41:45.262 --> 01:41:46.782
then burned him.

01:41:47.782 --> 01:41:49.542
Good.

01:41:50.462 --> 01:41:51.582
You weren't seen, were you?

01:41:52.462 --> 01:41:53.502
Rest assured,

01:41:53.902 --> 01:41:55.702
only we know the truth.

01:42:01.062 --> 01:42:02.742
Very well done, Antheus.

01:42:03.862 --> 01:42:05.982
Now we have such power that

01:42:06.982 --> 01:42:10.902
we can set two countries on each other.

01:42:12.342 --> 01:42:14.462
So, what now?

01:42:16.582 --> 01:42:18.382
If we want to make a profit,

01:42:19.142 --> 01:42:20.822
we'll keep Ertuğrul Bey alive.

01:42:21.622 --> 01:42:23.262
We need him alive.

01:42:23.982 --> 01:42:26.902
Ares won't fear a dead Ertuğrul

01:42:27.942 --> 01:42:30.662
but an alive one will scare him

01:42:31.622 --> 01:42:34.102
and he'll give us the gold we want.

01:42:35.222 --> 01:42:38.302
Since you gifted a beautiful slave
such as Marya

01:42:39.022 --> 01:42:40.542
to Ares...

01:42:42.502 --> 01:42:44.662
You'll contact him soon.

01:42:45.862 --> 01:42:49.262
Marya will be our eyes in the castle.

01:42:52.062 --> 01:42:55.462
Come, let's see Ertuğrul Bey before
before we set off.

01:43:49.382 --> 01:43:52.022
May your rage keep you alive,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:43:53.582 --> 01:43:55.222
Feed off your rage...

01:43:57.582 --> 01:43:59.102
so we can get rich.

01:44:38.342 --> 01:44:40.582
Oh, Allah, you who helped Yusuf

01:44:42.502 --> 01:44:45.462
out of the darkest of holes.

01:44:47.542 --> 01:44:49.502
Help this poor servant

01:44:50.782 --> 01:44:51.902
of yours as well.

01:44:53.902 --> 01:44:55.062
Help me.

01:44:57.902 --> 01:44:58.902
Help me.

01:45:12.302 --> 01:45:14.462
<i>You asked for me, Your Highness.</i>

01:45:29.382 --> 01:45:30.382
Our Sultan...

01:45:32.342 --> 01:45:33.742
what did he order you to do?

01:45:38.382 --> 01:45:39.502
Find out what happened

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:43.622
and find Ertuğrul.

01:45:45.462 --> 01:45:46.942
You know all that you need to know,

01:45:48.262 --> 01:45:50.182
and since you found Ertuğrul,

01:45:53.222 --> 01:45:55.222
you don't need to stay here anymore.

01:45:58.182 --> 01:45:59.502
Ertuğrul Bey has been found.

01:46:00.142 --> 01:46:04.502
-But without finding those--
-Those who did it will be found.

01:46:09.382 --> 01:46:12.262
The Seljuk Emir is here.

01:46:17.542 --> 01:46:18.542
Dündar Bey is here,

01:46:19.902 --> 01:46:21.422
you're not needed anymore.

01:46:24.062 --> 01:46:28.182
-Your Highness...
-You've done your duty here, Turgut.

01:46:32.382 --> 01:46:33.702
Our army is marching.

01:46:35.502 --> 01:46:36.342
And

01:46:37.182 --> 01:46:38.502
the campaign awaits you.

01:46:41.462 --> 01:46:43.982
Take your alps tomorrow morning...

01:46:45.542 --> 01:46:46.422
and get going.

01:46:53.182 --> 01:46:54.902
Don't worry about here.

01:48:43.422 --> 01:48:44.662
May your reign be a successful one.

01:48:45.822 --> 01:48:47.622
May your village be happy.

01:48:52.582 --> 01:48:54.142
Thank you, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:48:55.822 --> 01:48:56.822
Thanks, dear.

01:48:57.622 --> 01:48:58.662
It means a lot.

01:49:35.942 --> 01:49:38.102
When do you join the campaign,
Turgut Alp?

01:49:43.622 --> 01:49:45.542
At dawn, we'll set out

01:49:46.382 --> 01:49:47.862
with the alps.

01:49:48.822 --> 01:49:50.662
Must be hard to leave

01:49:51.342 --> 01:49:52.542
while the village mourns.

01:49:54.022 --> 01:49:55.702
But you and your alps...

01:49:56.822 --> 01:49:58.422
are our hope.

01:50:00.022 --> 01:50:01.302
You are an alp.

01:50:02.182 --> 01:50:03.902
You'll get through this.

01:50:08.102 --> 01:50:09.302
Mourning aside,

01:50:11.822 --> 01:50:14.222
leaving without having
avenged Ertuğrul Bey

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:16.502
just doesn’t seem right.

01:50:19.102 --> 01:50:20.502
Don't worry.

01:50:21.742 --> 01:50:24.262
Ertuğrul Bey will be avenged.

01:50:25.342 --> 01:50:28.182
If our state wants you on the campaign,

01:50:28.702 --> 01:50:30.302
you have to take your sword

01:50:30.822 --> 01:50:32.342
and go to battle.

01:50:35.182 --> 01:50:36.182
Turgut.

01:50:38.542 --> 01:50:40.022
Don't forget this.

01:50:42.902 --> 01:50:45.102
There'll be someone waiting for you.

01:50:55.382 --> 01:50:56.862
It soothes my heart

01:50:58.062 --> 01:51:00.382
knowing that someone is waiting for me.

01:52:04.422 --> 01:52:07.102
We can never accept
the deaths of those we love.

01:52:11.182 --> 01:52:15.702
Can't accept burying a loved one.

01:52:20.942 --> 01:52:23.822
In my heart
I still can't believe you're gone.

01:52:26.982 --> 01:52:29.142
No words will persuade me.

01:52:31.382 --> 01:52:33.262
Ertuğrul!

01:52:36.222 --> 01:52:39.462
You told me you'd seen me in the eyes of
a scared deer.

01:52:41.302 --> 01:52:43.862
You saved me in my darkest hour.

01:52:46.622 --> 01:52:47.662
Look!

01:52:48.662 --> 01:52:49.862
I need help again.

01:52:53.862 --> 01:52:56.942
This time it's not the enemy's sword
that attacks me

01:52:58.862 --> 01:53:02.022
but the cold touch of the dark soil.

01:53:11.742 --> 01:53:12.742
Mother.

01:53:15.062 --> 01:53:16.062
My Gündüz.

01:53:18.462 --> 01:53:20.702
Why didn't you tell me you were here?

01:53:21.742 --> 01:53:23.822
You were sleeping, son,
I didn't want to wake you up.

01:53:24.222 --> 01:53:25.742
You should have.

01:53:26.942 --> 01:53:30.822
How will the flowers of his grave bloom
if we don't water them?

01:53:32.662 --> 01:53:33.862
Right, they won't.

01:53:34.982 --> 01:53:35.982
Good thinking, son.

01:54:03.582 --> 01:54:05.742
I have something to say to him.

01:54:06.902 --> 01:54:08.302
What is that, Gündüz?

01:54:12.342 --> 01:54:15.382
Dad, you wouldn't have let me
have a steel sword,

01:54:16.302 --> 01:54:17.702
but you're not here anymore.

01:54:18.582 --> 01:54:19.622
It's time.

01:54:20.502 --> 01:54:22.062
I took the sky sword.

01:54:53.822 --> 01:54:54.822
My Halime.

01:54:57.622 --> 01:54:58.622
My Gündüz.

01:55:02.062 --> 01:55:03.142
My Gündüz!

01:55:16.702 --> 01:55:17.702
Who are you?

01:55:24.102 --> 01:55:25.102
Where am I?

01:55:26.542 --> 01:55:27.862
You're safe, Ertuğrul.

01:55:28.662 --> 01:55:29.662
Save your energy.

01:55:30.342 --> 01:55:31.422
I'll get you back to health.

01:56:36.102 --> 01:56:37.182
Don't push yourself.

01:56:38.022 --> 01:56:39.102
You're still weak.

01:56:49.462 --> 01:56:51.022
I made you some soup.

01:56:52.022 --> 01:56:53.022
Drink.

01:56:58.422 --> 01:57:00.142
Now is not the time for soup.

01:57:01.822 --> 01:57:02.902
Where are my alps?

01:57:04.422 --> 01:57:05.342
Who are you?

01:57:07.262 --> 01:57:08.302
I found you injured.

01:57:09.102 --> 01:57:10.262
Consider me a friend.

01:57:10.982 --> 01:57:13.862
Come on, eat your food and get well.

01:57:16.622 --> 01:57:17.622
Why is my

01:57:19.222 --> 01:57:20.982
getting well so important to you?

01:57:24.022 --> 01:57:25.222
Not just for me,

01:57:26.022 --> 01:57:27.662
but for everyone who loves you.

01:57:29.382 --> 01:57:30.822
Your loved ones are waiting for you.

01:57:34.142 --> 01:57:36.422
Any news of them?

01:57:36.702 --> 01:57:38.222
You push yourself too hard.

01:57:38.862 --> 01:57:40.822
If you go on like this,
you'll never get to see them.

01:57:41.062 --> 01:57:43.142
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

01:57:43.502 --> 01:57:44.662
But I must go.

01:57:45.422 --> 01:57:46.422
Come on.

01:57:46.902 --> 01:57:48.502
You get well now.

02:00:18.742 --> 02:00:19.742
Thank you.

02:00:45.462 --> 02:00:48.182
We're ready to go to Karacahisar,
Your Highness.

02:00:48.502 --> 02:00:49.502
Good.

02:00:52.542 --> 02:00:54.302
Let's not keep our partner waiting.

02:00:55.662 --> 02:00:57.142
Forgive me, Your Highness,

02:00:58.062 --> 02:00:58.982
I don't understand.

02:01:01.262 --> 02:01:02.982
Open your eyes, Göktuğ.

02:01:04.662 --> 02:01:06.742
Even the night chases the morning.

02:01:07.822 --> 02:01:09.582
Why should we stay idle?

02:01:10.302 --> 02:01:12.462
We have to chase our gains.

02:01:13.662 --> 02:01:14.662
Look,

02:01:14.942 --> 02:01:18.302
every event opens a new door.

02:01:19.182 --> 02:01:20.942
If you knock at that door

02:01:21.862 --> 02:01:22.862
you win.

02:01:23.702 --> 02:01:25.782
This door is Hanlı Bazaar for us.

02:01:29.542 --> 02:01:31.742
A new era is beginning.

02:01:35.302 --> 02:01:36.302
Oh...

02:01:37.302 --> 02:01:39.062
And news from Bahadır Bey?

02:01:39.782 --> 02:01:40.782
He's on the road.

02:01:41.262 --> 02:01:42.742
He will arrive shortly.

02:01:44.062 --> 02:01:47.182
Good. Bahadır Bey is precious to us.

02:01:48.262 --> 02:01:49.262
Because

02:01:49.502 --> 02:01:51.782
Candar Bey's brother Bahadır Bey

02:01:52.502 --> 02:01:54.382
will bring Aslıhan down.

02:01:56.142 --> 02:01:57.022
Thanks to him...

02:01:58.822 --> 02:02:00.782
I'll marry Aslıhan...

02:02:02.382 --> 02:02:04.742
and get the Çavdar Village.

02:02:14.702 --> 02:02:18.342
We joined Sultan Alaeddin's army

02:02:19.222 --> 02:02:20.742
and destroyed the enemy.

02:02:21.582 --> 02:02:23.662
We showed the Çavdar bravery

02:02:24.102 --> 02:02:25.782
to everyone.

02:02:27.262 --> 02:02:29.302
Our village is behind us.

02:02:30.822 --> 02:02:32.342
Our brothers' village

02:02:32.862 --> 02:02:33.862
is ahead of us.

02:02:35.782 --> 02:02:36.782
Now

02:02:37.462 --> 02:02:38.942
it's time to unite

02:02:39.502 --> 02:02:40.342
under my rule.

02:02:41.622 --> 02:02:42.622
New battles

02:02:43.382 --> 02:02:45.542
and new treasures await us.

02:02:46.022 --> 02:02:47.382
Yes, my bey.

02:03:22.422 --> 02:03:23.422
Traitor.

02:03:28.182 --> 02:03:29.182
Go!

02:03:42.782 --> 02:03:43.782
Go!

02:03:50.782 --> 02:03:52.382
I give you this traitor, Father.

02:03:53.662 --> 02:03:54.942
Kara Tunga!

02:04:11.102 --> 02:04:12.902
Kara Tunga.

02:04:15.182 --> 02:04:16.182
You

02:04:16.462 --> 02:04:18.462
were one of my village's beys.

02:04:19.782 --> 02:04:22.382
You were the brother of my wife, Karaca.

02:04:27.222 --> 02:04:28.222
You were

02:04:28.902 --> 02:04:31.062
no different to me than
my son Sancar.

02:04:32.502 --> 02:04:34.302
But you...

02:04:36.942 --> 02:04:38.742
tried to tempt my wife...

02:04:41.062 --> 02:04:42.102
kill me...

02:04:45.702 --> 02:04:48.702
and take my title, huh?

02:04:54.222 --> 02:04:55.422
Shame on you!

02:04:56.702 --> 02:04:59.102
You denounced your own brother,

02:04:59.622 --> 02:05:00.622
your own blood.

02:05:01.622 --> 02:05:04.742
Bahadır Bey is my blood and my life.

02:05:12.662 --> 02:05:14.582
I have no brother like you.

02:05:27.742 --> 02:05:30.382
That's my wife.

02:05:32.342 --> 02:05:34.902
The honor of taking this traitor's head
is all yours.

02:05:42.462 --> 02:05:43.462
Whoever

02:05:44.622 --> 02:05:46.502
disobeys me

02:05:47.302 --> 02:05:48.302
and rebels

02:05:48.862 --> 02:05:50.182
against

02:05:51.222 --> 02:05:52.462
my rule

02:05:53.342 --> 02:05:55.902
pays with their head.

02:06:18.022 --> 02:06:19.342
The traitor's blood

02:06:20.582 --> 02:06:23.182
is the sweetest revenge.

02:06:52.142 --> 02:06:53.542
Not just my brother,

02:06:54.342 --> 02:06:55.702
but my entire life is yours.

02:06:57.022 --> 02:06:58.502
So long as you're well.

02:07:06.622 --> 02:07:08.382
Nothing will happen to me

02:07:10.422 --> 02:07:11.582
as long as I

02:07:13.422 --> 02:07:16.142
have my brave son,
my brave wife

02:07:17.462 --> 02:07:19.622
and my brave warriors.

02:07:22.862 --> 02:07:24.462
We're near the Çavdar Village.

02:07:27.622 --> 02:07:28.622
That's the village

02:07:29.462 --> 02:07:30.462
of my ancestors,

02:07:31.502 --> 02:07:33.302
of my brother Candar.

02:07:36.222 --> 02:07:38.622
And now it'll be mine.

02:07:42.062 --> 02:07:43.062
We have

02:07:45.262 --> 02:07:48.382
the great Emir Sadettin behind us.

02:07:49.582 --> 02:07:53.622
We'll rule these lands.

02:07:54.022 --> 02:07:55.462
Yes, my bey.

02:08:02.182 --> 02:08:03.222
My brave alps,

02:08:03.742 --> 02:08:06.302
we smashed the enemy in battle.

02:08:07.302 --> 02:08:10.262
We made the traitor pay.

02:08:10.982 --> 02:08:13.462
Now we'll take our village

02:08:13.822 --> 02:08:16.782
and rule these lands.

02:08:18.062 --> 02:08:20.702
Whoever stands against us,

02:08:21.262 --> 02:08:24.102
whoever resists our might,

02:08:24.622 --> 02:08:29.222
will have their heads on our spears.

02:08:29.462 --> 02:08:31.342
Long live Bahadır Bey!

02:08:31.462 --> 02:08:34.622
Long live Bahadır Bey!
Long live Bahadır Bey!

02:08:34.742 --> 02:08:36.382
Long live Bahadır Bey!

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:39.582
Long live Bahadır Bey!
Long live Bahadır Bey!

02:08:39.702 --> 02:08:41.262
Long live Bahadır Bey!

02:10:04.462 --> 02:10:07.822
Ertuğrul's death changed Karacahisar.

02:10:11.902 --> 02:10:13.022
How are the Kayıs?

02:10:13.662 --> 02:10:16.262
They couldn't get over
the death of Ertuğrul.

02:10:16.542 --> 02:10:18.542
Doesn't look like they will soon.

02:10:20.942 --> 02:10:23.982
If they knew what was about to happen
to them, they'd cherish these final days.

02:10:29.662 --> 02:10:32.622
When will we move to capture
Hanlı Bazaar, sir?

02:10:33.982 --> 02:10:34.902
Very soon.

02:10:36.502 --> 02:10:39.422
-Have you sent word to bandit Mihalis?
-Yes, sir.

02:10:41.222 --> 02:10:42.222
Good.

02:10:47.582 --> 02:10:49.542
He must've missed raiding caravans.

02:10:49.902 --> 02:10:51.262
He'll be very happy.

02:11:08.182 --> 02:11:09.502
That’s enough fresh air.

02:11:09.662 --> 02:11:10.742
Let's get inside.

02:11:10.982 --> 02:11:13.622
Our dear guest
Emir Sadettin will arrive soon.

02:11:14.462 --> 02:11:15.462
Let's see what he wants.

02:12:19.302 --> 02:12:20.302
Emir Sadettin.

02:12:21.542 --> 02:12:22.542
Welcome.

02:12:24.462 --> 02:12:25.462
Thank you.

02:12:26.182 --> 02:12:28.262
We prepared a feast in your honor.

02:12:30.622 --> 02:12:32.182
A full table...

02:12:33.302 --> 02:12:34.782
means a full heart.

02:12:39.862 --> 02:12:40.902
I like sharing.

02:12:44.302 --> 02:12:45.302
So do I.

02:12:51.302 --> 02:12:52.702
That's why I'm here.

02:12:59.222 --> 02:13:02.822
I'm sure a statesman like you will share
even the most precious things.

02:13:07.342 --> 02:13:10.582
Let's keep it brief, Ares.

02:13:13.782 --> 02:13:14.782
Until now,

02:13:15.782 --> 02:13:18.822
I've made all kinds of sacrifices
for my country.

02:13:20.622 --> 02:13:22.342
I'm sure you've done the same.

02:13:26.462 --> 02:13:28.542
We've ensured plenty of gains for
our respective states.

02:13:30.582 --> 02:13:31.582
However,

02:13:32.182 --> 02:13:34.302
now it's our turn to win.

02:13:36.542 --> 02:13:39.302
I'd be honored to work with you,
Emir Sadettin.

02:13:40.862 --> 02:13:41.982
What do you propose?

02:13:50.542 --> 02:13:51.462
Hanlı Bazaar.

02:13:56.142 --> 02:13:57.582
The first reward of our partnership.

02:14:00.062 --> 02:14:01.542
If we administer it together,

02:14:03.022 --> 02:14:04.502
we'll both be rich.

02:14:07.342 --> 02:14:08.662
If you accept,

02:14:09.502 --> 02:14:12.382
I'm here to propose a profitable
partnership.

02:14:14.342 --> 02:14:16.422
I'd like that very much.

02:14:17.822 --> 02:14:20.142
But there's something I'd like to know.

02:14:21.862 --> 02:14:23.982
You're the most powerful Seljuk Emir...

02:14:25.862 --> 02:14:27.502
why do you still want more?

02:14:29.702 --> 02:14:31.182
When I have the chance,

02:14:33.022 --> 02:14:35.062
why shouldn't I want more?

02:14:40.022 --> 02:14:41.022
Emir Sadettin.

02:14:42.062 --> 02:14:43.582
You only lack being the Sultan.

02:14:46.542 --> 02:14:47.542
Do you mean that?

02:14:52.782 --> 02:14:54.262
Why not?

02:15:33.690 --> 02:15:36.050
I told you to bring food
when you were coming!

02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:39.730
What's with this empty horse?

02:15:39.970 --> 02:15:42.170
Simko sent that horse for Ertuğrul.

02:15:42.690 --> 02:15:45.290
He said he doesn't want
to make Ares wait any longer.

02:15:55.130 --> 02:15:59.530
So it's time to be rewarded
for the things I've done for Ertuğrul.

02:16:00.330 --> 02:16:03.010
He said he'll wait for you at Monks Hill.

02:16:03.210 --> 02:16:04.650
You know what to do.

02:16:06.690 --> 02:16:08.450
Simko shouldn't worry.

02:16:09.130 --> 02:16:13.250
I'll bring Ertuğrul to him
of his own will.

02:16:48.370 --> 02:16:49.970
My God.

02:17:10.890 --> 02:17:13.010
Ertuğrul Bey, I told you not to get up.

02:17:13.610 --> 02:17:15.170
You haven't recovered yet.

02:17:17.610 --> 02:17:19.010
I'm fine, Antheus.

02:17:20.050 --> 02:17:21.130
Don't worry.

02:17:25.050 --> 02:17:27.450
I want to go back to my village.

02:17:28.730 --> 02:17:31.770
I know you burn with vengeance.

02:17:33.170 --> 02:17:36.530
But whoever set you up
couldn't find your body.

02:17:37.450 --> 02:17:39.170
They must be looking for you everywhere.

02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:41.930
And they'll never give up.

02:17:50.250 --> 02:17:52.730
There's nothing beyond death, Antheus.

02:17:54.690 --> 02:17:58.450
I'll never forget what you've done for me.

02:18:14.850 --> 02:18:18.210
Whoever did this to you must be
very powerful.

02:18:19.570 --> 02:18:21.250
I can't send you out there like that.

02:18:31.850 --> 02:18:34.770
Look, I brought clothes for you
from the village.

02:18:35.050 --> 02:18:36.450
And a horse that's waiting outside.

02:18:41.210 --> 02:18:44.450
We've got a long journey.
I'll come with you.

02:18:45.370 --> 02:18:46.730
Thank you, Antheus.

02:18:49.570 --> 02:18:51.890
I don't know how far we have to go.

02:18:55.810 --> 02:18:58.010
But the destination is apparent.

02:18:59.930 --> 02:19:03.450
The account between those degenerates
and us has to be settled.

02:19:05.450 --> 02:19:09.050
Whoever did this to me will pay for it.
