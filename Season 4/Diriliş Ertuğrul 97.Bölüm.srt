WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 97 will start after 12:30 min.

13:18.497 --> 13:23.017
Today, we choose
the best archer in the castle.

13:25.177 --> 13:27.577
I want all my men to be at their best.

13:28.497 --> 13:31.737
Therefore, you must practice.

13:33.777 --> 13:34.737
Get up!

13:38.017 --> 13:41.577
Soon enough, you will leave this castle
to conquer the world.

13:47.337 --> 13:48.577
When the time comes,

13:49.537 --> 13:54.497
failing to hit even one Turk
could mean losing our land.

13:54.857 --> 13:57.217
And I'll never let that happen!

14:09.817 --> 14:15.337
Any soldier who hits the apple
will win this sack of gold in my hand.

14:18.217 --> 14:21.137
If anyone misses,
retribution will be swift.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.217
And you can't run from my wrath.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.097
Long live Tekfur Ares!

14:38.177 --> 14:39.857
Bring him to me alive!

14:39.937 --> 14:41.257
-Go, quick!
-Ares!

14:46.977 --> 14:48.577
Run! Run!

14:53.217 --> 14:55.617
Come on, he's running off!
Go, get him, quick!

14:55.937 --> 14:56.817
Stop him!

15:05.697 --> 15:07.017
Upstairs!

15:07.937 --> 15:08.777
Run!

15:39.457 --> 15:41.337
Your soldiers have forgotten
how to fight, Ares.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.497
That's why I wanted you here.

15:44.617 --> 15:45.817
I'm at your command, Ares.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.720
Bahadır Bey.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.240
Bahadır Bey.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.440
What do you want Göktuğ?

16:06.440 --> 16:07.600
Don't go, Bahadır Bey.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.560
The emir wants to see you.

16:14.320 --> 16:16.800
I respected the state.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.520
He was the emir of the sultan,

16:20.240 --> 16:22.640
I dismantled my tent for him.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.920
I migrated.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.800
Came to these lands.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.000
If I go to a man

16:30.320 --> 16:34.440
who can't protect me or my child,
may my leg be broken.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.480
If I ask for help
may my house be destroyed.

16:38.640 --> 16:39.520
Did you understand?

16:40.840 --> 16:43.760
Save the rage for your enemies,
Bahadır Bey.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.120
Not for your friends.

16:47.320 --> 16:49.600
Is there a greater enemy than the one...

16:50.600 --> 16:53.800
who took my child
and hope away while my house

16:54.000 --> 16:56.120
was destroyed, Göktuğ?

16:56.640 --> 16:59.040
Do not push away the hand
you respected

16:59.440 --> 17:03.240
which was extended to you
in a time of need, Bahadır Bey.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.080
You'll be alone when you fall.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.480
Your rage will consume you.

17:09.280 --> 17:10.920
It'll let you down.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.840
Don't do it.

17:14.760 --> 17:15.920
Tell your Emir that...

17:17.120 --> 17:20.360
my ears are
deaf to his words.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.520
I'll go my own way.

17:28.880 --> 17:29.880
Let him go.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.400
By order of our sultan,

17:43.080 --> 17:45.960
my mission in these lands has ended,
Ertuğrul Bey.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.960
God willing, I'll return to Konya today.

17:53.440 --> 17:57.560
You'll be responsible for the decisions
you make here,

17:57.880 --> 17:58.960
know that.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.960
I hope your decisions...

18:02.840 --> 18:04.960
will not bring trouble here.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.720
Don't forget this.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.240
I did my duty, Your Highness.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.600
I hope that when you arrive in Konya,

18:15.240 --> 18:20.200
you'll quickly find the ones who poisoned
our sultan, and who trapped

18:20.800 --> 18:23.000
me and my alps.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.840
Do you doubt it, Ertuğrul Bey?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.120
When I saw our Sultan poisoned,

18:33.840 --> 18:37.120
when I was trapped
on my way to war,

18:38.320 --> 18:42.320
I saw that there were people who plotted
against our state, Emir Sadettin.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.480
Ertuğrul Bey.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.040
The rage caused by that trap
has blinded both...

18:52.800 --> 18:55.240
your eyes and brave heart.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.320
You're so blinded
that you can't know friend from foe.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.080
Know it well,

19:05.560 --> 19:09.520
our state is strong enough to punish
the traitors.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.800
When the time comes,
you'll be ashamed of what you said.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.920
But at that time,
I'll be at your side again.

19:29.400 --> 19:34.000
Know the value of these lands given to you
by the Sultan.

19:35.280 --> 19:38.960
I'll sacrifice anything
for the state, Emir Sadettin.

19:39.680 --> 19:45.560
You should know that
I won't allow traitors in my lands here.

19:45.960 --> 19:49.080
Our state will rule forever.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.200
Our Sultan may know

19:51.640 --> 19:54.560
that there are brave men
ready to die for him,

19:54.680 --> 19:56.640
and that's enough for us.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.040
Emir Sadettin.

20:02.440 --> 20:03.880
We'd have liked to see you

20:03.960 --> 20:07.520
at the wedding of Aslıhan Hatun
and Turgut Alp.

20:09.400 --> 20:13.520
But since I know you're so busy
with state affairs, I won't insist.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.480
May God bless them.

20:34.840 --> 20:35.840
Hafza.

20:36.880 --> 20:37.880
Mother Hayme.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.880
The orphans are dressed.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.880
The poor have their food.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.280
Thank you, dear.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.520
Thank you.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.880
Take care of the kitchen.

20:47.160 --> 20:48.160
Yes, Mother Hayme.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.760
Thank God.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.920
Our bey brought the good old days
back as well, Mother.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.280
Thank God, dear.

20:59.920 --> 21:00.920
But...

21:01.280 --> 21:04.440
I wish Dündar could see it as well.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.120
Open the door.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.400
His Highness has a long journey ahead.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.200
Dündar.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.560
Welcome to my castle,
my dear friend Titan.

22:09.320 --> 22:10.320
My friend Ares.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.760
You've already started your games.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.200
Show me your face.

22:21.560 --> 22:22.800
I didn't want anyone

22:23.240 --> 22:26.040
to see that I'd come to your castle,
Ares.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.840
When you have a problem like Ertuğrul,
we can't risk anything.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.920
I know you called me here for him too.

22:35.760 --> 22:36.760
You're right.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.320
Am I to kill him?

22:51.280 --> 22:55.360
Killing him isn't easy,
even for a great warrior like you, Titan.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.600
I'm sure that you'll do it in time, but...

23:00.320 --> 23:04.560
I decided that I needed a demon
like you to hit him where it hurts.

23:05.480 --> 23:10.520
I wish to ambush him where he's most safe
and strong, his own village.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.560
So, I must infiltrate his village.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.280
Yes.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.920
Won't be easy,
but I'll do it, Ares.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.840
It'll be easier than you expect, Titan,

23:21.920 --> 23:24.240
because you'll hit their weakest spot.

23:24.760 --> 23:25.920
What's that?

23:30.480 --> 23:31.480
Mercy.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.240
You'll hit them with their own mercy,
but...

23:39.640 --> 23:41.640
it'll hurt you to do it.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.720
I'm ready to die for our cause.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.160
Are you going right away?

24:00.440 --> 24:02.320
I'll go to my brothers' village

24:02.760 --> 24:04.760
to let them know that our Bey lives.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.360
It's my duty to go to their village
anyway.

24:09.320 --> 24:10.720
Duty doesn't wait.

24:18.160 --> 24:21.560
I was careless
and broke your heart.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.440
Forgive me.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.320
Give me your blessing.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.840
Bless you, Dündar Bey.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.480
You're our brother.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.160
Return quickly.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.040
I'll get on the road, my bey.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.640
Any orders?

25:03.640 --> 25:04.640
An eye to see...

25:05.680 --> 25:06.520
behind the mountains,

25:07.440 --> 25:10.200
a mind to see
what'll come to pass, Dündar.

25:12.840 --> 25:17.840
I hope that this road opens
your eyes and your mind.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.200
Farewell, brother.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.160
Farewell, Dündar.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.920
Artuk Bey,
if I offended you too,

25:42.200 --> 25:43.200
forgive me.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.000
Give me your blessing.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.760
You've had a rough start.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.360
I hope it'll be easier in the end.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.480
Bless you.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.280
Godspeed.

26:06.320 --> 26:07.320
Son,

26:08.040 --> 26:10.280
don't doubt yourself.

26:11.760 --> 26:15.720
You'll grow in the path
that your brother made for you.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.520
I hope so, Mother.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.120
Farewell.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.120
Godspeed, Dündar.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.240
Godspeed.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.760
Son.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.560
Dündar has learned his lesson.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.280
Look at how he's shaken.
His eyes have been opened.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.440
No need for him to go.

27:24.720 --> 27:25.720
Maybe...

27:27.120 --> 27:28.360
you should reconsider?

27:31.880 --> 27:33.880
If I forgive him today,

27:35.280 --> 27:37.560
men will follow his example.

27:38.240 --> 27:43.120
Mistakes like this will lead
to treason.

27:44.360 --> 27:45.520
I can't have it.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.360
Merit is what we need.

27:49.840 --> 27:53.600
If Dündar proves that he's worthy
of this village, he'll return.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.480
Pray, Mother.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.160
You know best, son.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.280
How did he just leave?

28:16.120 --> 28:18.400
Couldn't you catch up with him?

28:19.160 --> 28:20.160
I did.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.280
I did, but...

28:23.920 --> 28:28.480
Göktuğ, say what you have to say
without wasting my time.

28:31.040 --> 28:35.440
Did you tell Bahadır Bey
that I was waiting, or didn't you?

28:36.800 --> 28:37.800
I did.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.480
I did, Your Highness.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.240
But--

28:43.840 --> 28:44.840
But what?

28:45.600 --> 28:46.600
But what?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.760
How can he disobey my order?

28:51.880 --> 28:53.240
What did he say?

28:53.680 --> 28:55.360
He said that you didn't protect...

28:56.640 --> 28:59.840
his child,
so your words fell on deaf ears.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.760
What?

29:05.040 --> 29:08.120
Alpamış wants to see you, Your Highness.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.680
Let him come.

29:20.480 --> 29:22.120
Aslıhan and Turgut...

29:23.760 --> 29:26.320
will never live happily.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.160
You too, Bahadır Bey.

29:30.360 --> 29:33.200
I won't even let you be bey
of your own village.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.360
You won't even have a grave.

29:37.560 --> 29:39.600
You'll know who Emir Sadettin is

29:40.000 --> 29:41.880
just like everyone else.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.680
The vengeance in my veins...

29:51.160 --> 29:53.800
will be poison to their veins.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.080
When the Çavdar Village mourns,

29:58.520 --> 30:02.640
I'll have a feast of fun.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.280
Candar Bey's whole line...

30:07.560 --> 30:08.560
will die.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.480
You'll infiltrate them.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.760
You'll tell me everything Ertuğrul does.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.560
Don't worry.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.040
I won't just infiltrate the Kayıs.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.160
I'll set them against each other.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.200
Is it enough, Titan?

31:00.920 --> 31:04.800
Do your duty
with this dagger you once gifted me, Ares.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.640
May the Kayıs drown in their mercy.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.680
Ertuğrul's mercy will cost him
his son Gündüz.

31:23.080 --> 31:25.200
You'll bring his son to me.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.880
God bless our Empire.

31:29.800 --> 31:30.800
Amen.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.160
Your Highness.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.240
Speak, Alpamış.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.360
What news from the village of Bahadır Bey?

31:44.600 --> 31:46.320
We're migrating, Your Highness.

31:46.520 --> 31:47.520
Lots of carriages.

31:48.120 --> 31:51.160
Ox carts slow us down,
but we're almost there.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.320
I wanted to come tell you,
giving scouting as an excuse.

31:55.760 --> 31:56.760
Good.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.760
You're just in time, Alpamış.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.880
Göktuğ and you
have an important task.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.600
Tell me, Your Highness.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.560
Thanks to you,

32:18.360 --> 32:20.920
I've knew everything
that Bahadır Bey did all this time.

32:23.040 --> 32:26.920
Both you and
Aslıhan's friend, Esma,

32:27.280 --> 32:28.880
have been my eyes.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.520
Anything for our state, Your Highness.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Alpamış.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.240
It's very important
that Bahadır Bey becomes

32:40.600 --> 32:41.960
the bey of the Çavdars.

32:43.240 --> 32:45.920
But Aslıhan Hatun slows him down.

32:47.320 --> 32:49.080
She won't get on board.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.560
For both villages to unite...

32:54.720 --> 32:59.360
and for Bahadır to be Bey,
Aslıhan must die.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.760
My sword will obey you, Your Highness.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.520
Keep it sheathed.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.920
Göktuğ will give you poison.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.680
You'll bring it to Esma.

33:16.920 --> 33:21.520
That poison will be our wedding gift
to Aslıhan Hatun and Turgut Alp.

33:22.520 --> 33:27.280
May they be in excruciating pain
until their very last breath.

33:29.720 --> 33:32.200
Their deaths will be an example.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.240
As you order, Your Highness.

33:44.920 --> 33:45.920
In this world...

33:47.800 --> 33:50.200
seas are set on fire.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.240
Love is drowning in that sea.

33:57.720 --> 34:02.360
Even if it rains poison,
love is staying under it.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.600
Love is...

34:06.440 --> 34:08.840
drinking the poison and dying.

34:32.720 --> 34:35.240
He humiliated us in public.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.280
He exiled me,

34:37.760 --> 34:40.840
Bahadır Bey's own son,
from my own village.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.880
Have you lost your tongues?
Are your wrists broken?

34:45.640 --> 34:47.160
We have our tongues...

34:47.960 --> 34:49.480
and our wrists.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.840
Nobody can exile
my son from my village.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.240
But he did, Father.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.400
In front of the Oghuz beys.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.240
And you kissed Ertuğrul's hand
and swore fealty.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.760
If I swore fealty,
it's to avenge us.

35:06.600 --> 35:10.400
If I was exiled too,
who would avenge us, huh?

35:18.400 --> 35:19.400
Let him...

35:20.320 --> 35:21.520
console himself...

35:22.120 --> 35:23.840
with his beys.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.240
The arrow is shot.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.920
Now go, join our migrants.

35:32.960 --> 35:38.160
Choose the bravest
and the strongest alps.

35:38.760 --> 35:39.960
Hide in the mountains.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.800
Hunt and train.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.560
When the time comes,

35:46.240 --> 35:49.080
I'll give you and your men a task.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.760
Wait for blood in the mountains.

35:54.800 --> 35:58.560
Wait, so when the time
for vengeance comes...

35:59.600 --> 36:01.040
you'll have your blood.

36:02.680 --> 36:03.840
And Emir Sadettin?

36:07.040 --> 36:08.440
From now on,

36:09.600 --> 36:10.640
his word...

36:11.680 --> 36:13.160
doesn't mean much.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.520
Son.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.240
We'll fend for our own.

36:21.360 --> 36:25.360
We'll make Ertuğrul pay,
not with diplomacy,

36:25.960 --> 36:27.600
but with our sword.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.000
As you command, Father.

36:36.360 --> 36:42.360
I'll sharpen my blade with rage
until we take our revenge on Ertuğrul.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.320
Patrol the village.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.640
Keep your eyes open.

37:04.840 --> 37:05.840
Go.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.080
Samsa Alp!

37:25.760 --> 37:26.760
Samsa Alp!

37:27.280 --> 37:28.880
Samsa, someone's wounded!

37:34.040 --> 37:35.040
Help.

37:36.680 --> 37:37.680
Help.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.800
-Who is this?
-Help.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.160
What happened?

37:49.640 --> 37:50.960
Who did this?

37:52.520 --> 37:53.520
Bandits.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.640
Bandits attacked me.

37:58.320 --> 38:01.640
On my way to the bazaar,
they took it all.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.360
Please don't leave me for dead.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.560
Don't worry.
We don't abandon anyone.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.320
Who are you?

38:15.720 --> 38:16.720
I'm Daryus.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.680
A Christian merchant.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.640
I didn't want to
disturb you, but...

38:27.000 --> 38:28.200
I had no choice.

38:30.120 --> 38:32.440
Patch me up and give me some food.

38:33.000 --> 38:33.880
Please.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.720
Our village and table are open to anyone.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.160
Turks really are helpful people.

38:44.640 --> 38:45.920
God bless you.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.280
Let's carry Daryus to the healing tent.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.600
-God bless you.
-Come on.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.880
God bless you.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.120
Alpamış, what are you doing here?

39:18.160 --> 39:20.720
Our patron sends his regards, Esma.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.080
A small gift for your services.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.280
Anything for His Highness, Alpamış.

39:38.520 --> 39:41.840
This is the wedding gift
from His Highness to Aslıhan Hatun.

39:42.880 --> 39:43.880
What is it?

39:44.200 --> 39:47.960
A poison, which will
kill the lovers and make us rich.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.400
I'll wait for you here when you're done.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.320
Not with one,
but three bags of gold.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.920
The stones you touch
will only shine

40:29.440 --> 40:32.280
when they see a beauty worthy of them.

40:32.840 --> 40:36.440
This necklace
will look beautiful on you.

40:37.040 --> 40:40.440
His Highness' offer
has not only honored you,

40:40.840 --> 40:42.360
but me as well.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.720
If our bey orders it,
I'll surely accept it.

40:47.680 --> 40:52.440
But if I have the final say,
I won't abandon my village.

40:53.040 --> 40:55.720
<i>Çavdar Village will be my home.</i>

40:56.600 --> 40:58.080
Forgive me, Your Highness.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.040
My decision is final.

41:00.360 --> 41:01.360
Nobody,

41:02.000 --> 41:05.640
<i>nobody will take you from me.</i>

41:06.280 --> 41:07.280
<i>I will...</i>

41:08.160 --> 41:10.080
<i>never give up, Aslıhan.</i>

41:20.480 --> 41:24.320
Your Highness, I took the poison from
the priest and gave it to Alpamış.

41:24.960 --> 41:25.960
Esma has it.

41:27.920 --> 41:28.920
Both will die.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.280
Good.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.960
We're ready to depart, Your Highness.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.360
No.

41:37.360 --> 41:40.840
When they're dying in pain,

41:42.120 --> 41:46.440
I'll listen to
the sad drums of the Çavdar Village.

41:48.560 --> 41:54.760
I'll be sure that both that liar Aslıhan
and Turgut are dead.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.120
And Bahadır Bey?

42:00.200 --> 42:01.200
Ertuğrul...

42:03.000 --> 42:08.400
will surely blame him
for Turgut and Aslıhan's death.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.280
Alpamış must die.

42:15.880 --> 42:18.840
When Ertuğrul finds his body,

42:20.120 --> 42:22.280
he'll know he works for Bahadır.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.880
And he'll think Bahadır had them poisoned
and he'll take his head.

42:28.920 --> 42:31.400
You always think the best, Your Highness.

42:32.480 --> 42:38.640
Bahadır will take his share
from Ertuğrul's rage and sword.

42:51.840 --> 42:53.640
Who is he?

42:55.120 --> 42:58.080
His name is Daryus,
a merchant going to the Hanlı Bazaar.

42:59.240 --> 43:02.760
Bandits attacked him on the road,
poor man.

43:04.120 --> 43:06.960
He sought refuge here,
we wanted to help.

43:10.960 --> 43:11.960
Well done.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.080
All right.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.760
On top of beating him,
they stabbed him as well.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.560
We patched it up before he lost
too much blood.

43:32.360 --> 43:33.440
Thanks, Artuk Bey.

43:35.360 --> 43:36.480
Get well.

43:37.760 --> 43:39.240
So, it was the bandits.

43:40.960 --> 43:41.960
Indeed.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.400
They took everything.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.760
You're lucky to have found us.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.120
Those scum are our enemies as well.

43:53.120 --> 43:54.800
We'll take care of you.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.160
Now, get some rest.

43:59.480 --> 44:00.480
God bless you.

44:01.520 --> 44:02.600
May you be stronger.

44:05.440 --> 44:06.600
Thank you.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.080
Poor man.

44:20.120 --> 44:22.200
I'll let Ertuğrul Bey know.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.000
Do whatever he needs.

44:26.240 --> 44:27.920
Don't worry, Turgut Alp.

45:25.880 --> 45:28.800
At last you'll marry Turgut Alp,
Aslıhan Hatun.

45:30.360 --> 45:31.600
God willing, Esma.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.200
God willing.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.400
I wish Aliyar could see it too.

45:40.200 --> 45:42.600
I wish he put this belt on me.

45:44.280 --> 45:47.160
Such is fate, Aslıhan Hatun.
Don't worry.

45:52.360 --> 45:55.400
You have Turgut Alp and Ertuğrul Bey
on your side.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.840
A small gift.

46:14.200 --> 46:18.080
A wolf pelt for a boy,
a deer pelt for a girl.

46:28.480 --> 46:29.800
Thanks, Esma Hatun.

46:40.120 --> 46:41.720
God bless you.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.920
You've kept my secrets all this time.

46:45.760 --> 46:48.040
You've consoled me.

46:49.280 --> 46:55.160
You accompanied me after the deaths
of my father and Aliyar.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.920
God bless you, Aslıhan Hatun.

46:59.480 --> 47:02.840
You treated me like a sister
instead of a villager.

47:50.520 --> 47:51.520
My Bey.

47:51.880 --> 47:53.840
A merchant named Daryus arrived.

47:54.880 --> 47:58.200
Bandits robbed him
and injured him.

47:58.760 --> 48:00.760
He took refuge here, just so you know.

48:01.600 --> 48:03.320
We patched him up, my Bey.

48:03.800 --> 48:07.120
Gave him food.
He's resting now.

48:10.560 --> 48:11.560
Well done.

48:12.880 --> 48:14.760
We can't turn those people away.

48:15.880 --> 48:17.680
But be cautious.

48:19.040 --> 48:20.320
He's a poor man.

48:20.920 --> 48:22.520
I don't think he'll harm anyone.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.560
Foxes hide under sheep pelts, Samsa.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.600
Enemies are everywhere.

48:30.360 --> 48:33.400
Pay attention even to the wind.

48:34.320 --> 48:35.440
As you say.

48:42.600 --> 48:47.560
After eating,
let's measure Turgut's dresses.

48:49.200 --> 48:51.000
What for, Mother Hayme?

48:52.600 --> 48:54.240
Halime Hatun and Hafza...

48:54.920 --> 48:59.200
are making him a dress for the wedding.

49:01.800 --> 49:06.720
Brother Turgut,
such is the life of a married man.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.040
Bamsı.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.240
Bamsı, you do this every time.

49:19.480 --> 49:22.560
Your words will bury you,
watch out.

49:29.440 --> 49:32.120
Why do men and women marry, Father?

49:37.360 --> 49:38.600
Our Prophet said,

49:39.160 --> 49:41.320
"Marriage is my example.

49:42.040 --> 49:43.040
Marry...

49:44.360 --> 49:49.600
so that I will be proud of
your numbers against other faiths."

49:50.880 --> 49:52.560
So, I married your mother.

49:54.360 --> 49:56.360
I have brave sons like you.

49:57.200 --> 50:02.680
Bamsı Alp and Hafza Hatun
will have brave sons like you, too.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.200
God willing.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.160
God willing, Halime.

50:11.720 --> 50:12.720
God willing.

50:14.560 --> 50:18.120
One day,
you'll have children too, Gündüz.

50:18.760 --> 50:21.080
I want to be an alp first, Grandma.

50:21.160 --> 50:23.400
Oh, my dear.

50:24.080 --> 50:26.160
Gündüz, you're already an alp, son.

50:26.640 --> 50:30.560
I haven't hunted,
or killed an enemy, Mother.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.200
You're right.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.000
I promised you, son,

50:37.400 --> 50:40.680
we'll go together for your
and your brother's first hunt.

50:42.600 --> 50:45.760
Then my mother should measure me as well.

50:46.160 --> 50:48.080
I want an alp's clothes.

50:48.680 --> 50:51.240
I won't marry before being an alp.

50:56.960 --> 51:00.200
Coward men don't get girls here anyway,
Gündüz.

51:05.560 --> 51:06.560
Samsa.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.560
Bring some food to the merchant.

51:10.920 --> 51:11.920
As you order.

51:27.560 --> 51:28.680
Horses go fast,

51:29.720 --> 51:31.280
bards speak skillfully.

51:31.840 --> 51:32.840
Thank you, my bey.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.960
For Turgut's marriage
and for my son's bravery,

51:38.760 --> 51:42.000
sing us something
from the steppes,

51:42.760 --> 51:45.000
and from the lands of our fathers.

51:45.480 --> 51:46.720
All right, my bey.

51:51.200 --> 51:53.200
Resurrection is our holy cause

51:53.920 --> 51:56.360
started by Suleiman Shah's son.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.240
He hunted enemies down,

51:59.920 --> 52:02.480
his name is Ertuğrul the Brave.

52:03.640 --> 52:05.600
His alps died for him,

52:06.120 --> 52:08.320
his presence makes the world shiver,

52:08.560 --> 52:10.800
Turgut, Bamsı, Rahman and Doğan

52:11.160 --> 52:13.520
motherland is holy for them all.

52:14.840 --> 52:16.840
Arabi looks for Mevla,

52:17.240 --> 52:19.320
Artuk Bey cures the wound.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.640
We aim for Karacahisar,

52:21.920 --> 52:24.440
may God bless this army.

52:24.960 --> 52:25.960
Amen.

52:26.040 --> 52:30.480
The mad steel, the brave warriors,
let Sadettin the dog howl,

52:30.720 --> 52:32.960
may their hands never drop the swords,

52:33.200 --> 52:35.720
the heroes stand watch.

52:37.200 --> 52:39.080
Hayme is the mother of the village,

52:39.480 --> 52:41.840
Suleiman Shah's only love,

52:42.160 --> 52:44.320
his only flower in the tent,

52:44.960 --> 52:47.320
Kayı village was her home.

52:48.880 --> 52:50.880
Halime Sultan, love of her Bey,

52:51.480 --> 52:53.560
always proud of her man,

52:54.080 --> 52:56.400
she always stood by him,

52:56.640 --> 52:59.360
the Kayı line will continue with her.

53:00.120 --> 53:02.880
Son of Turcoman,
may our noble line continue,

53:03.200 --> 53:06.160
may our line never die out.

53:06.280 --> 53:08.600
Our councils at the Hanlı Bazaar,

53:08.800 --> 53:11.480
and our armies to victory.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.880
-Thank you, Bard.
-Thanks, my bey.

53:16.200 --> 53:17.200
Thank you.

53:31.800 --> 53:36.320
I called you here because
the castle is unprepared.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.200
What?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.400
Sir, Ertuğrul Bey sent you a letter.

53:46.800 --> 53:47.800
Read.

53:53.560 --> 53:55.920
"Tekfur Ares,
I shall visit the castle tomorrow.

53:56.120 --> 53:59.920
I wish to see everything as I left them.
Bey Ertuğrul, son of Suleiman Shah."

54:03.600 --> 54:04.600
Go away.

54:13.680 --> 54:16.240
Even though this looks like
a regular visit,

54:17.400 --> 54:19.280
he might have other intentions.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.560
Like what, sir?

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
First,

54:23.680 --> 54:25.680
Ertuğrul knows everything we do.

54:26.480 --> 54:29.240
He's not coming to inspect,
but to see his prey.

54:30.760 --> 54:32.480
Second, he doesn't doubt us.

54:33.200 --> 54:35.280
He'll want to cooperate.

54:36.880 --> 54:39.040
We'll be prepared in any case.

54:39.600 --> 54:43.000
Sir, won't we do anything when he comes?

54:43.120 --> 54:44.120
Absolutely not.

54:44.240 --> 54:46.800
Since he's visiting,
we'll prepare accordingly.

54:47.560 --> 54:49.520
Prepare a welcoming feast.

54:49.640 --> 54:51.240
As you order, sir.

54:53.080 --> 54:57.480
I've heard that Ertuğrul Bey humiliated
the Çavdar bey Batuhan.

54:58.040 --> 54:59.720
He exiled his son.

55:00.960 --> 55:04.960
So, Emir Sadettin is powerless
against Ertuğrul as well.

55:05.720 --> 55:09.400
Ertuğrul will be bolder in
his future steps now.

55:10.480 --> 55:12.480
What will we do now, sir?

55:12.960 --> 55:17.960
Sir, will we only fortify
the walls and have more guards?

55:19.960 --> 55:21.080
Don't you worry.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.800
I took the biggest precaution.

55:26.760 --> 55:28.120
What is that, sir?

55:28.480 --> 55:31.480
You'll learn, along with him, soon.

55:33.560 --> 55:34.560
Have patience.

55:43.332 --> 55:44.332
Wait.

55:44.892 --> 55:45.892
Let me help you.

55:47.172 --> 55:48.212
Stand up.

55:52.172 --> 55:53.172
There you go.

55:55.172 --> 55:57.652
Ertuğrul Bey has sent this to you
from his table.

55:58.892 --> 55:59.892
Thank him.

56:02.012 --> 56:03.492
This is a feast for me.

56:04.012 --> 56:07.732
My mother Hayme and Halime Sultan
cooked these personally.

56:08.452 --> 56:09.532
Sure, it's a feast.

56:09.932 --> 56:11.892
Ertuğrul Bey and his family are very kind.

56:12.892 --> 56:15.572
Does he help anyone who falls on
hard times?

56:15.772 --> 56:16.772
Is that even a question?

56:18.092 --> 56:19.252
He's the hope for the poor.

56:19.572 --> 56:21.452
He treats everyone equally.

56:22.372 --> 56:25.572
The only thing that matters
to him is right and wrong.

56:27.412 --> 56:28.852
How nice.

56:30.012 --> 56:33.092
Tell me, do you have a wife and kids?

56:35.252 --> 56:36.292
We had caravans.

56:37.532 --> 56:39.892
One day, bandits looted everything

56:40.052 --> 56:41.172
in a sudden raid.

56:43.012 --> 56:45.252
They killed my two kids
and my wife.

56:48.932 --> 56:49.932
I reopened old wounds,

56:50.772 --> 56:51.772
sorry for that.

56:52.372 --> 56:53.372
Don't be sorry.

56:54.212 --> 56:55.692
I'm used to being alone.

56:58.332 --> 56:59.692
Your pavilion is very crowded.

56:59.972 --> 57:01.172
How many tents are there?

57:02.492 --> 57:03.492
Whatever you see.

57:04.172 --> 57:05.172
Got it.

57:06.132 --> 57:08.092
I guess all the men here are warriors.

57:08.652 --> 57:09.932
Everyone here is a warrior.

57:11.052 --> 57:13.772
That's right,
the Turks are all warriors.

57:14.892 --> 57:18.252
Your pavilion is very nice
but you don't have walls or a castle.

57:18.652 --> 57:20.812
Aren't you afraid of an enemy's attack?

57:21.812 --> 57:25.532
Our God that we pray to,
our flag that flies,

57:26.372 --> 57:28.292
our bey that we embrace
and take orders from

57:28.652 --> 57:30.572
are more than enough to scare the enemy.

57:33.212 --> 57:34.532
Go ahead, eat your food.

57:34.692 --> 57:37.132
That'll help.
My Ertuğrul Bey is waiting for me.

57:55.132 --> 57:56.692
It's time to conquer

57:57.932 --> 57:59.692
Karacahisar Castle.

57:59.892 --> 58:02.172
Magnificent! Finally.

58:03.652 --> 58:05.252
Thank God.

58:11.932 --> 58:13.852
We've been waiting for this for so long.

58:16.012 --> 58:19.412
-May our holy war be blessed, my bey.
-Finally hypocrisy stops ruling.

58:19.852 --> 58:21.292
Now it's time for weapons to talk.

58:21.852 --> 58:23.612
When do we attack the castle, Bey?

58:24.292 --> 58:26.732
On the morning of Turgut's wedding,
Artuk Bey.

58:29.932 --> 58:30.932
The morning of the wedding

58:31.572 --> 58:33.892
is when Ares will least expect us.

58:34.732 --> 58:37.612
We'll take him by surprise
when he thinks

58:38.452 --> 58:40.172
we're at the wedding, having fun.

58:44.172 --> 58:46.012
That's my wedding present to you, Turgut.

58:50.572 --> 58:52.369
I will sacrifice myself
for that kind of present, Bey.

58:53.892 --> 58:55.892
Will we let the Oğuz beys know?

58:57.332 --> 58:59.092
If we let the Oğuz beys know

58:59.932 --> 59:01.812
Emir Sadettin may hear about it.

59:02.852 --> 59:05.172
And that might jeopardize the conquest.

59:07.172 --> 59:08.492
We won't tell anyone.

59:09.572 --> 59:11.572
With God's help,
our strength will be enough

59:12.292 --> 59:14.732
to take over Karacahisar Castle.

59:15.732 --> 59:16.732
With God's help, my bey.

59:16.892 --> 59:18.492
My bey, my bey...

59:19.092 --> 59:21.172
We can take over ten of them.

59:21.452 --> 59:22.492
With God's help.

59:35.732 --> 59:36.772
The door of the castle

59:37.572 --> 59:38.932
will open at dawn...

59:40.332 --> 59:42.092
and close when the sun goes down.

59:43.972 --> 59:45.532
-Abdurrahman.
-My bey.

59:46.052 --> 59:49.692
You'll get into the castle with soldiers
who are dressed like the people.

59:50.132 --> 59:52.332
When you get in, you'll find Atsiz.

59:52.612 --> 59:55.812
The two of you will figure
out the measures Ares took

59:55.892 --> 59:57.852
without drawing attention
to yourselves.

00:59:58.492 --> 01:00:00.052
I want to know everything,

01:00:01.212 --> 01:00:03.612
what's in the castle,
how many guards there are,

01:00:04.212 --> 01:00:06.292
the weapons of these guards,

01:00:06.852 --> 01:00:10.412
even the number of rocks in the walls,
Abdurrahman.

01:00:11.572 --> 01:00:14.932
Get out before the castle door closes
and get to Cavdar Pavilion.

01:00:15.252 --> 01:00:17.012
I'll be waiting for
your intelligence there.

01:00:17.412 --> 01:00:18.412
Yes, my Bey.

01:00:21.212 --> 01:00:23.532
What will the soldiers do
once inside the castle?

01:00:25.492 --> 01:00:28.012
When the castle door opens,
they'll enter the courtyard.

01:00:30.212 --> 01:00:31.972
They'll be the ones to prevent

01:00:32.092 --> 01:00:35.372
the doors from shutting
when the soldiers see us coming.

01:00:36.092 --> 01:00:38.612
And tomorrow,
I'll go to the castle to visit Ares.

01:00:39.132 --> 01:00:40.492
I'll do my best

01:00:41.252 --> 01:00:44.892
to make him trust me,
and sleep peacefully in his bed.

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:50.852
Now everyone, back to work.

01:00:53.892 --> 01:00:55.292
-Artuk Bey.
-Yes, my bey.

01:00:56.292 --> 01:00:57.652
When we arrive at the castle

01:00:58.332 --> 01:00:59.852
you should go to the pavilion

01:01:00.452 --> 01:01:04.212
and make everyone carry their weapons,
including the women.

01:01:05.612 --> 01:01:07.252
Secure the pavilion.

01:01:07.772 --> 01:01:08.892
Your wish is my command.

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:10.732
Don't forget,

01:01:11.892 --> 01:01:14.892
we're not battling
for loot or treasure,

01:01:15.812 --> 01:01:17.172
but for God's will

01:01:17.652 --> 01:01:20.372
and our holy mission.

01:01:21.212 --> 01:01:23.532
Don't let that slip from your mind,

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:26.252
so you won't give up.

01:01:27.252 --> 01:01:29.132
May our holy war be blessed, my bey.

01:01:30.892 --> 01:01:31.892
Amen, brothers.

01:01:49.012 --> 01:01:50.252
Thank you, Hatun.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:33.332
Hatuns!

01:02:38.332 --> 01:02:41.412
Make sure there are no flaws
with the food or the service.

01:02:41.652 --> 01:02:44.652
Our dear Hatun is getting married,
we wouldn't make any mistakes.

01:02:44.852 --> 01:02:45.852
Thank you.

01:03:12.012 --> 01:03:13.972
Go back to what you were doing.

01:03:17.732 --> 01:03:18.732
Esma.

01:03:19.492 --> 01:03:20.732
Keep an eye on them.

01:03:21.212 --> 01:03:23.212
Obviously she's coming to spread evil.

01:03:30.292 --> 01:03:31.772
What do you want, Karaca Hatun?

01:03:32.452 --> 01:03:34.052
For you to get what you deserve.

01:03:35.852 --> 01:03:39.332
If you're trying to spread your evil,
don't get too excited.

01:03:39.892 --> 01:03:41.972
I won't tolerate you anymore.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.692
While our kid is being exiled,

01:03:45.172 --> 01:03:47.652
you're getting ready for a wedding.

01:03:49.852 --> 01:03:52.532
Don't think this marriage
will do you any good.

01:03:53.732 --> 01:03:56.332
If your kid had some morals

01:03:56.652 --> 01:03:58.732
he wouldn't have been exiled,
Karaca Hatun.

01:03:59.412 --> 01:04:01.692
Everyone gets what they deserve.

01:04:02.692 --> 01:04:03.772
Thank God.

01:04:05.172 --> 01:04:07.492
You and Ertuğrul walked all over
your own uncle.

01:04:08.372 --> 01:04:09.772
You took his son away.

01:04:10.412 --> 01:04:12.132
You devastated our pavilion.

01:04:13.612 --> 01:04:15.852
Let's see if your pavilion prospers!

01:04:19.772 --> 01:04:20.812
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:04:21.732 --> 01:04:23.532
You're going to reap what you sow.

01:04:24.772 --> 01:04:28.612
What could you do without Ertuğrul Bey?
Now you threaten me?

01:04:29.852 --> 01:04:31.252
Here's my pavilion.

01:04:31.972 --> 01:04:33.972
Do your best.

01:04:34.932 --> 01:04:37.452
But you should know
that from now on

01:04:37.572 --> 01:04:39.292
tongues that talk too much
will be clipped,

01:04:39.452 --> 01:04:41.292
and heads of those that rebel
will be cut off.

01:05:11.572 --> 01:05:13.892
-Let's meet tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.

01:06:51.972 --> 01:06:53.052
What's wrong, Abdurrahman?

01:06:54.092 --> 01:06:55.812
Good news, Atsiz.

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.332
It's time to conquer Karacahisar.

01:07:02.092 --> 01:07:05.292
Our bey will raid the castle
when its doors open in the morning.

01:07:06.052 --> 01:07:07.492
He'll visit Ares at noon.

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:11.012
He wants to keep him happy

01:07:11.412 --> 01:07:12.692
and catch him by surprise.

01:07:13.652 --> 01:07:15.172
Our bey thought it out carefully.

01:07:15.892 --> 01:07:20.092
But Ares has increased security
since Ertuğrul Bey's return.

01:07:20.532 --> 01:07:22.572
He closes the doors
when the sun goes down,

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:24.572
and opens them when it rises.

01:07:24.772 --> 01:07:26.452
We have to get our men inside

01:07:26.612 --> 01:07:30.052
so the doors can't shut
when our brave men arrive.

01:07:30.572 --> 01:07:32.572
My Ertuğrul Bey knows about this.

01:07:33.252 --> 01:07:35.892
My men are in disguise
with me and have infiltrated

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:37.732
with the excuse of trading.

01:07:38.612 --> 01:07:39.772
Then our job

01:07:40.452 --> 01:07:42.412
will be to fan the flame.

01:07:43.052 --> 01:07:45.932
Ertuğrul Bey wants you to learn
about the measures in the castle.

01:07:47.572 --> 01:07:48.572
Follow me.

01:08:24.652 --> 01:08:26.052
May God protect us.

01:08:27.532 --> 01:08:29.492
The frontiersman of my government.

01:08:29.892 --> 01:08:32.972
May God grant you
many more high positions.

01:08:36.652 --> 01:08:37.652
High positions exist

01:08:39.012 --> 01:08:41.812
to serve God's will, my Halime.

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:45.292
May God be pleased,

01:08:45.852 --> 01:08:48.012
and may our religion
and traditions stand tall,

01:08:49.092 --> 01:08:50.292
that's enough.

01:09:05.012 --> 01:09:06.732
You should go to Cavdar Pavilion.

01:09:07.292 --> 01:09:09.252
I'll come when I leave the castle.

01:09:10.172 --> 01:09:12.452
Today is the big day, my Halime.

01:09:14.052 --> 01:09:15.332
May God protect you.

01:09:16.372 --> 01:09:17.372
You too.

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:19.812
May God protect you too.

01:09:20.932 --> 01:09:22.092
God speed.

01:09:23.012 --> 01:09:24.012
Amen.

01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:45.292
<i>Salaam-Alaikum.</i>

01:09:45.572 --> 01:09:46.692
<i>Alaikum-Salaam</i>, my bey.

01:09:47.012 --> 01:09:48.092
<i>Alaikum-Salaam</i>, Bey.

01:10:02.412 --> 01:10:03.972
What's the condition of our men, Turgut?

01:10:05.412 --> 01:10:07.612
Abdurrahman and our men
have infiltrated the castle.

01:10:08.732 --> 01:10:11.252
They'll let us know
what they learn as soon as possible.

01:10:12.732 --> 01:10:13.732
Thank you.

01:10:15.332 --> 01:10:18.452
How's the pavilion doing, Artuk Bey?
Are the wedding preparations over?

01:10:18.652 --> 01:10:21.172
Everything is being done properly, my bey.

01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:23.172
Everyone's very busy.

01:10:24.492 --> 01:10:25.492
The people...

01:10:26.212 --> 01:10:29.212
were covered in cobwebs
for a while.

01:10:30.252 --> 01:10:33.812
I hope this will be
the occasion to blow them away.

01:10:34.172 --> 01:10:35.572
Weddings come with miracles.

01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:39.852
I hope this wedding will open the door
to many happy days.

01:10:40.412 --> 01:10:42.332
God willing, my bey.

01:10:43.452 --> 01:10:44.612
When we go to the castle

01:10:45.412 --> 01:10:48.012
you take care of the preparations here,
Artuk Bey.

01:10:48.772 --> 01:10:49.892
Your wish is my command.

01:10:50.172 --> 01:10:51.452
Can I come in, my bey?

01:10:51.812 --> 01:10:52.812
Come in, Samsa.

01:10:58.012 --> 01:10:59.012
My bey,

01:10:59.612 --> 01:11:01.732
Merchant Daryus wants to see you.

01:11:02.372 --> 01:11:03.372
Let him come in.

01:11:32.252 --> 01:11:34.732
I'm honored to be in your presence,
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:37.532
Thank you, Daryus.

01:11:38.452 --> 01:11:39.452
Sorry about what happened.

01:11:39.652 --> 01:11:40.652
Thank you.

01:11:41.412 --> 01:11:42.732
I escaped death thanks to you.

01:11:43.812 --> 01:11:45.532
I wanted to express my gratitude.

01:11:46.172 --> 01:11:47.172
Thank you.

01:11:47.732 --> 01:11:48.732
So, you're a merchant.

01:11:50.212 --> 01:11:51.972
-What do you trade?
-Everything.

01:11:53.212 --> 01:11:55.692
I trade anything that might make profit.

01:11:56.772 --> 01:11:59.052
Fur, animals... Silk.

01:11:59.332 --> 01:12:02.252
The bandit can't harm you
near our pavilion.

01:12:05.332 --> 01:12:07.252
Why did you come to us and not Ares?

01:12:09.612 --> 01:12:10.612
I don't know.

01:12:12.852 --> 01:12:13.972
I lost myself.

01:12:15.492 --> 01:12:17.692
I had no idea where my horse was going.

01:12:18.612 --> 01:12:21.772
Luckily, I arrived at a pavilion
that's hospitable.

01:12:23.092 --> 01:12:24.092
Otherwise...

01:12:24.932 --> 01:12:25.932
I would have been dead.

01:12:29.252 --> 01:12:30.172
All right then.

01:12:30.772 --> 01:12:31.932
You're our guest.

01:12:32.572 --> 01:12:34.572
You can stay as long as you'd like.

01:12:35.132 --> 01:12:36.732
All your needs will be met.

01:12:37.412 --> 01:12:38.532
Thank you, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:12:39.732 --> 01:12:40.932
May God bless you.

01:12:58.292 --> 01:12:59.292
Turgut.

01:13:01.412 --> 01:13:02.892
Don't let your guard down.

01:13:05.092 --> 01:13:05.932
Yes, Bey.

01:13:07.412 --> 01:13:08.412
Come on, we're leaving.

01:14:13.732 --> 01:14:16.052
Ertuğrul is already with Ares.

01:14:18.572 --> 01:14:21.052
Both of them will dig each other's grave,
Göktuğ.

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:26.812
They'll try to walk all over each other.

01:14:28.012 --> 01:14:29.532
When they get weak,

01:14:30.292 --> 01:14:31.772
I'll come back here.

01:14:32.812 --> 01:14:34.772
And then, Ertuğrul won't be able...

01:14:35.852 --> 01:14:39.772
to find Turkish pavilions
or our sultan by his side.

01:15:11.652 --> 01:15:13.372
Are all the preparations done, Kostas?

01:15:13.772 --> 01:15:16.852
Yes, sir. We've prepared everything
necessary for the welcome.

01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:57.492
Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:15:58.412 --> 01:15:59.692
Thank you, Tekfur Ares.

01:16:06.172 --> 01:16:08.292
Congratulations on being the frontiersman.

01:16:09.252 --> 01:16:13.612
I'd like to gift you this white flag
to maintain the peace between us.

01:16:15.852 --> 01:16:16.972
I hope it never gets stained.

01:16:19.932 --> 01:16:21.292
Thank you, Tekfur Ares.

01:16:30.012 --> 01:16:33.212
If we're the ones to hold the peace flag,
it won't get stained.

01:16:34.692 --> 01:16:36.692
However if it was stained before us,

01:16:37.212 --> 01:16:38.492
we can't clean it.

01:16:44.572 --> 01:16:46.132
I'm throwing a banquet for you.

01:16:46.972 --> 01:16:48.692
Come on in, let's talk there.

01:17:27.332 --> 01:17:29.532
Hit it, Gündüz!

01:17:51.892 --> 01:17:53.972
<i>So you're Gündüz, the son of Ertuğrul.</i>

01:18:21.052 --> 01:18:23.812
<i>Your father will pay the price</i>
<i>for what he's done through you.</i>

01:18:23.972 --> 01:18:26.372
<i>But first, let's meet and become friends.</i>

01:18:38.052 --> 01:18:40.132
Is Tekfur Ares still seeing Ertuğrul Bey?

01:18:40.652 --> 01:18:41.692
Yes, ma'am.

01:18:52.532 --> 01:18:55.252
You must be the soldiers of Ertuğrul Bey.

01:18:59.612 --> 01:19:00.852
That's correct.

01:19:03.092 --> 01:19:04.692
I've heard of the fame of the Kayis.

01:19:06.852 --> 01:19:08.212
I got to see you today.

01:19:13.092 --> 01:19:14.092
Thank you.

01:19:14.572 --> 01:19:16.692
You must be a noble that just arrived
from Nicaea.

01:19:17.492 --> 01:19:19.452
Otherwise you would have seen us already.

01:19:22.652 --> 01:19:23.812
I'm not from Nicaea.

01:19:25.852 --> 01:19:27.492
I'm not really a noblewoman.

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:33.012
I was gifted to Tekfur Ares
by the slave trader Simko.

01:19:34.252 --> 01:19:35.692
So I was actually a slave.

01:19:46.932 --> 01:19:48.532
I guess this visit will be long.

01:19:49.532 --> 01:19:50.732
I wish you a good day.

01:20:00.132 --> 01:20:01.052
Brother,

01:20:01.732 --> 01:20:03.292
what kind of a woman is she?

01:20:03.652 --> 01:20:06.892
The way she looks is full of cunning.

01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:16.052
I won't drink wine
next to our valuable guest.

01:20:22.612 --> 01:20:25.812
In my absence, bandits terrorized
the caravans that stopped in Hanlı Bazaar.

01:20:27.172 --> 01:20:28.172
Unfortunately.

01:20:28.932 --> 01:20:31.612
The bandit incident
caused all of us trouble.

01:20:32.092 --> 01:20:33.212
If that's true,

01:20:34.132 --> 01:20:36.532
why haven't you cooperated with us
on this matter?

01:20:38.452 --> 01:20:41.372
Your soldiers could have gone after
the bandits.

01:20:41.652 --> 01:20:42.652
But Ertuğrul Bey,

01:20:43.052 --> 01:20:45.652
the safety of the merchants
on these lands is your responsibility.

01:20:46.652 --> 01:20:50.292
-We could only protect ourselves.
-It's obvious how you protect yourself.

01:20:51.812 --> 01:20:55.452
You threatened
the Greek merchants by pulling them away.

01:20:57.092 --> 01:20:58.612
It wasn't a threat, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:20:59.212 --> 01:21:00.932
I did what I had to do.

01:21:01.252 --> 01:21:03.692
-You know, Greek merchants--
-The past

01:21:04.052 --> 01:21:05.492
is in the past, Tekfur Ares.

01:21:07.932 --> 01:21:09.532
Now we have to think about the future.

01:21:11.012 --> 01:21:13.492
Hanlı Bazaar is important for us
and for you.

01:21:16.812 --> 01:21:20.172
We will cooperate to improve
the trade in the bazaar.

01:21:23.892 --> 01:21:26.772
It's nice to hear that from you.
I'm listening.

01:21:27.972 --> 01:21:30.052
We'll act together against the bandit.

01:21:30.972 --> 01:21:33.292
To improve the trade in the bazaar,

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:37.572
we'll make sure the Greek
and Muslim merchants come to the bazaar.

01:21:38.212 --> 01:21:39.572
If we don't,

01:21:40.252 --> 01:21:43.292
the peace flag you gave me
won't mean much.

01:21:48.852 --> 01:21:50.092
There's peace in this.

01:21:51.092 --> 01:21:52.212
There's profit.

01:21:53.612 --> 01:21:55.012
There's a partner like yourself.

01:21:55.812 --> 01:21:57.732
You'd have to be an idiot to say no.

01:22:01.132 --> 01:22:02.132
Good.

01:22:05.372 --> 01:22:06.732
Now I'd like to see the castle.

01:22:07.452 --> 01:22:09.852
I'm curious about what
the Muslim merchants have been up to.

01:22:10.252 --> 01:22:11.492
You should come with me

01:22:12.172 --> 01:22:13.692
in case they need anything.

01:22:14.772 --> 01:22:15.772
Go on, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:22:43.932 --> 01:22:44.972
Brother Abdurrahman.

01:22:46.732 --> 01:22:48.412
I've written down everything I know.

01:22:49.372 --> 01:22:51.332
The number of the day and night guards,

01:22:52.492 --> 01:22:54.852
when they change the guards, everything.

01:22:57.372 --> 01:22:59.692
The reaction team that's in the castle
will cause us

01:23:00.972 --> 01:23:03.852
more trouble rather than the guards
in the backyard and the towers.

01:23:08.852 --> 01:23:11.172
They'll take action to close the doors

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:13.972
when our bey attacks.

01:23:14.532 --> 01:23:15.532
Don't you worry.

01:23:16.892 --> 01:23:19.132
My men who infiltrated will prevent this.

01:23:21.132 --> 01:23:23.972
The number of reaction team members
and their weapons are on that paper.

01:23:26.292 --> 01:23:29.492
We'll catch the guards at the door
and towers by surprise.

01:23:31.132 --> 01:23:32.972
Before Ares can figure out

01:23:33.852 --> 01:23:36.852
what's going on, we'll let Ertuğrul Bey
and his men in.

01:23:38.492 --> 01:23:39.492
Brother Abdurrahman,

01:23:40.572 --> 01:23:43.892
hopefully, we'll have
Turgut Alp's wedding in Karacahisar.

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:45.652
Amen.

01:23:46.252 --> 01:23:47.812
God help us, Brother.

01:23:52.972 --> 01:23:55.772
The men who are on duty should
blend into the night

01:23:55.892 --> 01:23:56.972
and come to this store.

01:23:57.212 --> 01:23:58.852
I'll tell them their duties one by one.

01:23:59.532 --> 01:24:01.532
Don't worry.
They'll be on time.

01:24:35.652 --> 01:24:38.132
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you.

01:24:38.252 --> 01:24:39.932
Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:24:40.732 --> 01:24:43.612
Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
May God always let you be by our sides.

01:24:43.692 --> 01:24:44.692
Thank you.

01:24:45.052 --> 01:24:49.412
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you.

01:24:51.132 --> 01:24:54.772
It's impossible not to get jealous
of the love your people are showing you.

01:24:55.612 --> 01:24:58.892
I wonder how you keep this
without losing their trust.

01:24:59.532 --> 01:25:01.132
With justice, Tekfur Ares.

01:25:01.532 --> 01:25:06.292
Justice is the treasure that opens
the door for all blessings and peace.

01:25:07.092 --> 01:25:09.052
I share this treasure with them.

01:25:25.732 --> 01:25:27.172
You're a brave man, Ertuğrul Bey.

01:25:28.092 --> 01:25:30.572
It's an honor for me
to have peace with you.

01:25:31.252 --> 01:25:33.852
But if one day
this peace comes to an end,

01:25:35.372 --> 01:25:38.452
it would be an honor for me
to have a brave enemy like you.

01:26:07.252 --> 01:26:10.652
I'd like to see a brave enemy
as well, Ares.

01:26:11.572 --> 01:26:14.652
Not the kind of scumbags
who trap you and hide their faces.

01:26:19.412 --> 01:26:21.692
There's no point in talking about
wars and hostility.

01:26:21.972 --> 01:26:24.292
If one day this peace comes to an end,

01:26:24.652 --> 01:26:26.812
we're the kind of people
who can talk it out.

01:26:28.212 --> 01:26:29.292
You should know that,

01:26:29.932 --> 01:26:32.212
if one backs down from his word,
we see that

01:26:32.852 --> 01:26:33.932
as a betrayal.

01:26:35.012 --> 01:26:36.692
We don't talk betrayal out,

01:26:37.172 --> 01:26:38.652
we solve the matter with weapons.

01:26:54.452 --> 01:26:56.452
-Welcome, Ertuğrul Bey.
-Thank you.

01:27:19.492 --> 01:27:21.452
Can I come in, Aslıhan Hatun?

01:27:29.132 --> 01:27:30.172
Come in, Bahadir Bey.

01:27:46.812 --> 01:27:50.012
Go ahead, Bahadir Bey.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?

01:27:52.572 --> 01:27:54.332
Congratulations on your wedding.

01:27:55.132 --> 01:27:57.012
I'm here to ask if you need anything.

01:27:57.532 --> 01:27:58.612
I don't, Bahadir Bey.

01:27:59.212 --> 01:28:01.492
Just don't bother me. That's all I ask.

01:28:05.492 --> 01:28:06.492
Girl.

01:28:08.812 --> 01:28:10.932
I know we hurt each other a lot.

01:28:12.012 --> 01:28:13.692
I didn't want it to be this way.

01:28:14.812 --> 01:28:16.972
However, despite everything,

01:28:18.492 --> 01:28:20.132
I'm your uncle.

01:28:21.092 --> 01:28:22.372
And you're my niece.

01:28:24.052 --> 01:28:25.492
As soon as you showed up here,

01:28:25.932 --> 01:28:27.972
you tried to take over my pavilion.

01:28:28.612 --> 01:28:29.812
You threatened me.

01:28:30.492 --> 01:28:31.492
As if that wasn't enough,

01:28:31.732 --> 01:28:33.932
you stabbed Turgut Alp in my tent

01:28:34.772 --> 01:28:37.692
and you and your son disrespected
Ertuğrul Bey.

01:28:38.732 --> 01:28:41.052
Just don't bother me
on this happy day of mine.

01:28:41.732 --> 01:28:42.732
You are...

01:28:43.132 --> 01:28:44.892
an important Cavdar woman.

01:28:46.012 --> 01:28:49.212
At least one man from our bloodline
should be at the wedding by your side.

01:28:50.132 --> 01:28:52.812
Allow me to carry out my duty.

01:28:53.252 --> 01:28:54.532
Let me be there.

01:28:54.972 --> 01:28:56.292
No, thanks, Bahadir Bey.

01:28:56.852 --> 01:28:59.372
I still feel hurt by what you did.

01:28:59.972 --> 01:29:03.812
So just stay away
from me and my pavilion.

01:29:08.292 --> 01:29:09.652
Now I have stuff to do.

01:29:10.652 --> 01:29:11.652
Excuse me.

01:29:29.772 --> 01:29:33.052
The hero got on that winged horse
and went right to where the monster was.

01:29:33.892 --> 01:29:35.132
The monster had three heads.

01:29:36.092 --> 01:29:38.252
One was a goat,
one was a lion

01:29:38.732 --> 01:29:40.332
and one was a dragon.

01:29:41.332 --> 01:29:43.892
The winged horse flew towards the dragon.

01:29:44.652 --> 01:29:46.452
The hero drew his sword,

01:29:47.132 --> 01:29:49.252
cut all three heads of the monster
and killed it.

01:29:50.212 --> 01:29:52.292
And set the winged horse free.

01:29:53.012 --> 01:29:55.212
Does the winged horse still live?

01:29:55.572 --> 01:29:56.572
Of course it does.

01:29:56.972 --> 01:29:58.092
It's still in the sky.

01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:00.852
Only heroes can see it.

01:30:01.572 --> 01:30:03.292
I'm going to become an Alp anyway.

01:30:03.452 --> 01:30:05.972
Can I see the winged horse then?

01:30:06.412 --> 01:30:07.412
Of course you will.

01:30:08.012 --> 01:30:09.532
Maybe you can even ride it.

01:30:10.012 --> 01:30:12.372
-I'd like to see it right away.
-No,

01:30:13.012 --> 01:30:14.172
you can't see it right away.

01:30:18.132 --> 01:30:19.292
Wait, don't get sad.

01:30:20.372 --> 01:30:21.372
You know what,

01:30:22.012 --> 01:30:23.692
the winged horse sometimes comes around.

01:30:24.092 --> 01:30:25.932
Do you know when?

01:30:27.932 --> 01:30:29.052
Sure I do.

01:30:29.292 --> 01:30:30.452
Don't worry.

01:30:31.972 --> 01:30:33.572
I'll tell you when it comes by.

01:30:33.852 --> 01:30:35.612
-Deal?
-Deal.

01:30:48.492 --> 01:30:49.492
Thank you.

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:52.692
Thank you, Esma Hatun.

01:30:56.612 --> 01:30:57.772
Thank you, Esma Hatun.

01:31:26.732 --> 01:31:29.092
I hope you enjoy it, Daughter.

01:31:30.172 --> 01:31:31.412
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

01:31:38.732 --> 01:31:40.932
It's a small gift, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:31:42.452 --> 01:31:43.532
May God bless you.

01:31:46.612 --> 01:31:47.612
Magnificent.

01:31:48.092 --> 01:31:49.612
They're all so nice.

01:31:50.772 --> 01:31:51.932
May God bless your hands.

01:31:53.252 --> 01:31:55.012
Bless your hearts.

01:31:55.652 --> 01:31:57.092
You haven't let neither me

01:31:57.772 --> 01:31:59.412
nor my pavilion alone.

01:32:00.772 --> 01:32:02.452
I don't know how I can repay that.

01:32:03.212 --> 01:32:04.412
What do you mean?

01:32:05.332 --> 01:32:07.332
We see you as a daughter.

01:32:08.052 --> 01:32:10.092
And you'll be our daughter in law.

01:32:15.652 --> 01:32:18.132
Esma Hatun, hand me the velvet bundle.

01:32:24.932 --> 01:32:25.932
In the name of God.

01:32:47.332 --> 01:32:50.092
Hafsa Hatun and I sewed this for you,
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:32:51.012 --> 01:32:52.252
It'll look very good on you.

01:32:53.172 --> 01:32:54.412
God bless your hands.

01:32:55.212 --> 01:32:56.612
It's so pretty.

01:32:57.132 --> 01:32:58.892
Aslıhan Hatun, it'll look so good on you.

01:32:59.092 --> 01:33:00.652
It'll be an addition to your beauty.

01:33:01.292 --> 01:33:02.292
Thank you.

01:33:02.532 --> 01:33:05.012
Aslıhan Hatun,
let's see how it looks on you.

01:33:05.292 --> 01:33:06.972
-Come on.
-Let's see it.

01:33:08.012 --> 01:33:09.212
Come on, let's see it.

01:33:12.612 --> 01:33:14.612
It looks so good.

01:33:19.172 --> 01:33:20.172
Amazing.

01:33:20.652 --> 01:33:22.092
You shine like the moon.

01:33:22.332 --> 01:33:23.732
Magnificent.

01:33:24.372 --> 01:33:26.132
You look like a fairy, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:33:28.252 --> 01:33:29.332
Wonderful, Sister.

01:33:29.972 --> 01:33:32.772
I hope we can see the days
when your daughters wear these.

01:33:39.292 --> 01:33:40.292
Come on.

01:33:45.852 --> 01:33:47.732
May God bless you.

01:33:48.452 --> 01:33:50.812
You helped me find this peace.

01:33:51.252 --> 01:33:53.092
I hope many of us can see

01:33:53.892 --> 01:33:56.172
how good our sons and daughters become.

01:33:56.492 --> 01:33:57.492
God willing.

01:33:58.012 --> 01:33:59.132
God willing, Daughter.

01:33:59.532 --> 01:34:00.532
God willing.

01:34:26.092 --> 01:34:27.292
Yah!

01:34:59.892 --> 01:35:03.372
<i>Eşhedü en la îlahe îllallah</i>

01:35:03.692 --> 01:35:07.532

01:35:09.412 --> 01:35:10.812
Amen.

01:35:12.692 --> 01:35:14.612
Aslıhan Hatun, daughter of Candar,

01:35:15.452 --> 01:35:17.132
do you accept Turgut,

01:35:17.652 --> 01:35:19.092
the son of Konur Alp

01:35:19.612 --> 01:35:22.572
as your husband, with the condition that

01:35:23.412 --> 01:35:25.412
he gives you 100 gold coins?

01:35:25.892 --> 01:35:26.892
I do.

01:35:27.092 --> 01:35:28.092
Do you?

01:35:28.652 --> 01:35:30.172
-I do.
-Do you?

01:35:30.932 --> 01:35:31.932
I do.

01:35:33.252 --> 01:35:34.852
Turgut, son of Konur Alp,

01:35:35.172 --> 01:35:37.092
do you accept

01:35:37.412 --> 01:35:40.012
Aslıhan Hatun, daughter of Candar,

01:35:40.652 --> 01:35:42.452
as your wife

01:35:43.132 --> 01:35:44.532
with the condition that

01:35:45.332 --> 01:35:47.852
you give her 100 gold coins?

01:35:49.212 --> 01:35:50.212
I do.

01:35:51.092 --> 01:35:52.092
Do you?

01:35:52.772 --> 01:35:54.532
-I do.
-Do you?

01:35:57.892 --> 01:35:58.892
I do.

01:36:02.532 --> 01:36:03.532
Witnesses,

01:36:03.772 --> 01:36:05.652
do you witness this?

01:36:06.252 --> 01:36:07.812
-We do.
-We do.

01:36:08.292 --> 01:36:12.932
I now pronounce you husband
and wife in the presence of witnesses

01:36:13.652 --> 01:36:14.732
and the people here.

01:36:15.692 --> 01:36:18.052
May God bless your marriage.

01:36:18.332 --> 01:36:19.332
Amen.

01:36:21.332 --> 01:36:22.332
My God,

01:36:23.532 --> 01:36:26.452
we witness this marriage.

01:36:26.972 --> 01:36:28.172
May you be a witness too.

01:36:28.452 --> 01:36:29.452
Amen.

01:36:29.572 --> 01:36:30.412
My God,

01:36:30.572 --> 01:36:32.932
bless their marriage.

01:36:33.372 --> 01:36:34.612
Amen.

01:36:34.732 --> 01:36:36.612
Grant them a good relationship,

01:36:37.132 --> 01:36:38.132
love,

01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:41.012
and persistence in their marriage.

01:36:41.372 --> 01:36:42.732
Amen.

01:36:42.852 --> 01:36:43.852
My God,

01:36:44.052 --> 01:36:45.852
grant this couple the love
and good relations

01:36:46.452 --> 01:36:48.972
that Adam <i>aleyhisselam</i>

01:36:49.532 --> 01:36:51.812

-Fatima had.
-Amen.

01:37:13.572 --> 01:37:15.772
My God, grant this couple

01:37:16.092 --> 01:37:18.492
loyal children,

01:37:19.212 --> 01:37:20.932
a long life,

01:37:21.572 --> 01:37:23.372
and lots of prosperity.

01:37:23.652 --> 01:37:25.092
-Amen.
-My God,

01:37:25.732 --> 01:37:28.972
bless us in this world
and in the afterlife

01:37:29.372 --> 01:37:30.612
with kindness, beauty

01:37:30.772 --> 01:37:32.492
and lots of felicity.

01:37:33.012 --> 01:37:34.052
Amen.

01:37:34.172 --> 01:37:36.812
Save us from the agony of fire.

01:37:37.172 --> 01:37:38.172
Amen.

<i>Subhâne rabbike rabbil izzeti ammâ yasifûn</i>

<i>Vel hamdu lillâhi rabbil âlemîn el Fatiha.</i>

01:38:42.111 --> 01:38:45.391
Brave men, listen to me carefully,

01:38:46.871 --> 01:38:50.591
and pass on my words to the men
who have infiltrated the castle.

01:38:52.311 --> 01:38:55.871
I know very well

01:38:57.111 --> 01:39:00.151
that every one of you came here
to be martyrs for the state and for Islam.

01:39:00.271 --> 01:39:01.231
Thank you.

01:39:01.471 --> 01:39:04.871
-We'd die for our state, brother Atsiz.
-Thank you.

01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:07.991
We only have one mission.

01:39:10.071 --> 01:39:15.191
And that is to let Ertuğrul Bey
and his alps into the castle.

01:39:18.951 --> 01:39:20.231
Know that...

01:39:21.791 --> 01:39:26.151
some of us may die
in pursuit of this objective.

01:39:26.511 --> 01:39:30.311
When our flag is flying
from the walls of the castle,

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:31.951
our spirits will find peace, God willing.

01:39:32.071 --> 01:39:33.831
-God willing.
-God willing.

01:39:35.071 --> 01:39:40.191
Right before the guards
change over in the morning...

01:39:42.911 --> 01:39:47.471
we will launch our attack on three fronts.

01:39:48.471 --> 01:39:51.471
As soon as Ertuğrul Bey and his alps
are spotted from the castle,

01:39:52.231 --> 01:39:54.511
the guards will attempt
to close the gates.

01:39:55.151 --> 01:39:59.671
Me and the first group
will prevent them from closing them.

01:40:01.471 --> 01:40:05.511
You and the second group
will kill the guards on the walls.

01:40:06.311 --> 01:40:08.551
We will throw their dead bodies
from the walls, Atsiz.

01:40:10.911 --> 01:40:13.431
You are with the third group.

01:40:15.511 --> 01:40:18.471
You'll stop the soldiers
who'll try to reach the main entrance.

01:40:20.631 --> 01:40:23.711
Brave comrades, that's all I have to say.

01:40:25.471 --> 01:40:26.951
Is there anything you want to ask?

01:40:27.511 --> 01:40:31.071
-May God help us.
-Amen.

01:40:42.511 --> 01:40:44.431
May God make you both happy,
Aslıhan Hatun.

01:40:44.831 --> 01:40:46.311
Thank you, my Ertuğrul Bey<i>.</i>

01:40:49.071 --> 01:40:52.671
-May God make you happy.
-Thank you.

01:41:02.231 --> 01:41:04.911
Be at the castle gate
when the sun rises, Turgut.

01:41:06.751 --> 01:41:08.231
As you command, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:41:08.711 --> 01:41:09.751
Mother Hayme.

01:41:11.351 --> 01:41:14.471
I wish you every happiness, my girl.

01:41:15.031 --> 01:41:17.911
May God bless your marriage.

01:41:18.991 --> 01:41:20.391
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

01:41:38.191 --> 01:41:41.111
Good man. Good man.

01:41:43.311 --> 01:41:45.751
-May God make you happy.
-Thank you.

01:41:48.511 --> 01:41:49.591
Son.

01:41:53.351 --> 01:41:56.031
May God bless you both.

01:41:57.471 --> 01:42:00.911
-I hope to see you always smiling.
-Amen, Mother Hayme.

Come on! Come on! Come on!

What has Turgut Alp done?

01:44:17.831 --> 01:44:21.991
What has he done for his beloved?

01:44:22.231 --> 01:44:26.831
He made the impossible come true!

01:44:26.911 --> 01:44:31.551
Did they break any hearts?
Did they speak ill?

01:44:31.871 --> 01:44:35.351
They didn't break any hearts,
nor did they speak ill!

01:44:35.511 --> 01:44:40.991
Then may God make them happy.

01:44:41.311 --> 01:44:42.991
Amen.

01:44:55.511 --> 01:44:57.191
May God make them happy.

01:44:58.231 --> 01:45:00.631
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:45:32.471 --> 01:45:34.151
Forgive me, Aslıhan Hatun.

01:46:06.391 --> 01:46:11.031
<i>Long live Aslıhan Hatun!</i>
<i>Long live Turgut Alp!</i>

01:46:16.831 --> 01:46:19.351
Look at that no good Kayi alp.

01:46:20.271 --> 01:46:22.791
He's marrying the daughter
of a great Bey of the Cavdars.

01:46:24.031 --> 01:46:25.431
It's all Ertuğrul's doing.

01:46:26.711 --> 01:46:31.511
I wouldn't be surprised if they make
this alp the Bey of the Cavdars.

01:46:34.391 --> 01:46:38.191
That's not possible while I'm here, wife.

01:46:39.271 --> 01:46:40.751
These are dangerous men, my bey<i>.</i>

01:46:41.391 --> 01:46:46.351
You went to congratulate them
and she dared to refuse you.

01:46:47.871 --> 01:46:50.431
Who knows what else
they'll dare do in the future.

01:46:52.511 --> 01:46:53.511
Enough!

01:46:55.951 --> 01:47:00.711
I've kept my silence today
not because I am weak or fearful,

01:47:01.271 --> 01:47:02.671
but because I have plans.

01:47:08.911 --> 01:47:11.951
I will bring my tribe here

01:47:12.951 --> 01:47:14.991
when Sancar Bey goes to the mountains

01:47:15.911 --> 01:47:21.111
and make the world unbearable for them.

01:47:23.191 --> 01:47:24.911
Well said, my Bey.

01:47:25.911 --> 01:47:28.751
But can't you see the alps of Cavdar
have already embraced them?

01:47:30.231 --> 01:47:32.671
Don't be fooled, wife.

01:47:36.231 --> 01:47:39.151
The alps will follow
whoever is most powerful

01:47:39.351 --> 01:47:42.911
and whoever promises
to lead them into battles.

01:47:45.391 --> 01:47:47.231
They'll all be with me

01:47:48.351 --> 01:47:52.151
when I take control of the tribe.

01:48:54.551 --> 01:48:59.591
We've walked through darkness,
experienced so many hardships...

01:49:00.311 --> 01:49:03.031
yet here we are, Aslıhan.

01:49:09.831 --> 01:49:14.311
Together we will hold the light
which banishes that darkness.

01:49:15.231 --> 01:49:17.591
We'll see our way through
the hardships together, Turgut.

01:49:20.111 --> 01:49:22.991
I hope so, Aslıhan. I hope so.

01:49:26.671 --> 01:49:32.911
Our tribes will be lit up
just like this tent

01:49:34.391 --> 01:49:37.391
when we raise our flag
above Karacahisar Castle's walls.

01:49:41.151 --> 01:49:42.711
You are going into battle?

01:49:43.711 --> 01:49:46.311
We'll be at the castle gates
when the sun rises.

01:49:47.671 --> 01:49:51.391
So you were destined to go to war
on the day of your wedding.

01:49:58.671 --> 01:50:01.631
For us, the real celebration is to fight,
Aslıhan.

01:50:07.751 --> 01:50:10.871
It's time that we strangle
the enemy with our claws.

01:50:13.511 --> 01:50:15.911
If I die trying...

01:50:20.071 --> 01:50:24.231
be proud of your husband
for the rest of your life.

01:51:18.151 --> 01:51:22.231
May God help you.
May your sword be sharp.

01:51:24.511 --> 01:51:26.671
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:51:29.071 --> 01:51:32.711
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>
<i>-Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

01:52:47.831 --> 01:52:49.191
Cruel fate...

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:53.351
you make my heart bleed.

01:52:58.951 --> 01:53:02.671
You've ripped joy from my life.

01:53:04.031 --> 01:53:07.751
You turn the wind into flames.

01:53:13.351 --> 01:53:17.111
You turn my drink into mud.

01:53:22.151 --> 01:53:25.391
If my heart is to be in agony,

01:53:26.431 --> 01:53:30.071
if I'm not allowed to be happy,

01:53:31.271 --> 01:53:34.151
I will not have peace
until I have ruined yours.

01:53:36.751 --> 01:53:41.591
Ertuğrul... I will have my vengeance.

01:53:42.471 --> 01:53:44.511
You'll groan in pain.

01:53:45.631 --> 01:53:48.511
I swear to God...

01:53:50.431 --> 01:53:55.671
I'll make you pay for what you've done!

01:55:49.871 --> 01:55:50.951
Aslıhan!

01:55:51.831 --> 01:55:52.911
Turgut!

01:55:59.711 --> 01:56:00.711
Turgut...

01:56:32.591 --> 01:56:33.751
Turgut...

01:56:58.431 --> 01:56:59.671
Just as Atsiz said,

01:57:00.991 --> 01:57:06.151
when the night guards open the gates,
we'll attack the castle.

01:57:06.951 --> 01:57:08.271
Our alps inside the castle

01:57:08.991 --> 01:57:12.351
will make the first attack
when they open the gate.

01:57:13.671 --> 01:57:17.071
We'll enter the castle
before the day guards arrive.

01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:21.911
It's likely there'll be fierce fighting
in the yard before you get there.

01:57:22.111 --> 01:57:27.711
But Atsiz and our alps should be able
to prevent them from closing the gates.

01:57:28.631 --> 01:57:31.751
He said the soldiers within
the castle will counter attack.

01:57:32.231 --> 01:57:34.951
You'll be inside the castle
while they fight them off.

01:57:35.151 --> 01:57:38.031
But if we're late,
they'll all die, my Bey.

01:57:43.391 --> 01:57:49.591
Our horses will ride like lightning
to get there, my Bey<i>, </i>like lightning.

01:57:50.551 --> 01:57:52.911
We'll be near the castle before sunrise.

01:57:53.511 --> 01:57:56.551
Our horses can rest until the moment
comes for us to go into the castle.

01:57:58.911 --> 01:58:02.631
The odds are three to one
in our favor, my Bey<i>.</i>

01:58:05.031 --> 01:58:09.311
Neither Ares nor his troops
will be expecting the attack.

01:58:09.951 --> 01:58:13.551
They won't know what hit them.

01:58:16.511 --> 01:58:19.831
There's one thing I'd like to know,
my Bey. Who is this Atsiz?

01:58:20.231 --> 01:58:21.511
He seems to be everywhere.

01:58:26.911 --> 01:58:29.111
You'll find out when the time comes,
Bamsi.

01:58:29.831 --> 01:58:31.351
Very well, my Bey, very well.

01:58:36.071 --> 01:58:37.551
Are the alps ready, Bamsi?

01:58:37.951 --> 01:58:40.951
Yes, my Bey. They're ready.
They're awaiting your orders.

01:58:42.151 --> 01:58:43.151
Well then.

01:58:44.711 --> 01:58:46.591
Go and fetch the ladies, Bamsi.

01:58:47.151 --> 01:58:49.711
It's time they know
we're going into battle.

01:58:50.631 --> 01:58:52.591
As you command, my Bey, as you command.

01:58:54.991 --> 01:58:55.991
Understood.

01:59:10.431 --> 01:59:11.431
Turgut!

01:59:21.191 --> 01:59:22.551
Turgut!

01:59:33.151 --> 01:59:34.591
Aslıhan.

01:59:46.231 --> 01:59:47.231
Aslıhan!

02:00:06.671 --> 02:00:07.791
Aslıhan...

02:00:13.671 --> 02:00:17.071
What's happening to us?
Who did this?

02:00:23.631 --> 02:00:25.711
Turgut, I can't bear it.

02:00:27.431 --> 02:00:29.911
Hold on, Aslıhan. Hold on.

02:00:31.631 --> 02:00:32.911
You'll be all right.

02:00:38.751 --> 02:00:39.751
Hold on!

02:00:47.551 --> 02:00:49.551
God, give me strength.

02:01:18.111 --> 02:01:19.111
Turgut!

02:01:21.671 --> 02:01:22.951
I can't take it!

02:01:24.751 --> 02:01:26.071
Hang on, Aslıhan!

02:01:57.351 --> 02:02:00.951
What is it, son? You called for us?

02:02:12.791 --> 02:02:14.111
It's time, Mother.

02:02:15.351 --> 02:02:17.471
We're going into battle
for Karacahisar Castle.

02:02:19.271 --> 02:02:22.711
I called you here to ask
for your blessings and your prayers.

02:02:29.711 --> 02:02:31.151
You have my blessing, son.

02:02:32.191 --> 02:02:35.751
May God make you victorious.

02:02:36.951 --> 02:02:40.311
May God strengthen the arm
holding your sword.

02:02:40.991 --> 02:02:43.111
God willing. Amen, Mother.

02:02:43.431 --> 02:02:45.591
I hope you come back very soon.

02:02:51.391 --> 02:02:52.471
My Halime.

02:03:10.831 --> 02:03:12.431
May God help you, Ertuğrul.

02:03:13.071 --> 02:03:16.311
May God protect you all.

02:03:16.831 --> 02:03:17.831
Amen.

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:20.831
Take good care of our children, my Halime.

02:03:22.431 --> 02:03:24.071
Don't worry, my Bey<i>.</i>

02:03:32.751 --> 02:03:35.791
The battle will be ours,
the victory will be God's.

02:03:36.951 --> 02:03:38.711
May God protect you, my Halime.

02:04:21.671 --> 02:04:23.551
Something's going on
in front of the main tent.

02:04:23.631 --> 02:04:25.551
Ertuğrul's alps are gathered there.

02:04:26.751 --> 02:04:30.631
Their Bey is here
and their lead warrior is getting married.

02:04:31.511 --> 02:04:33.111
Of course they've gathered together.

02:04:35.111 --> 02:04:36.791
Prepare the bed.

02:04:37.631 --> 02:04:40.111
My bey, this is not an ordinary gathering.

02:04:40.671 --> 02:04:44.071
The alps all have their swords
and are wearing their battle kit.

02:04:46.471 --> 02:04:47.471
Interesting.

02:04:50.271 --> 02:04:51.751
So what is going on?

02:04:54.271 --> 02:04:55.671
Let's take a look.

02:05:20.731 --> 02:05:22.051
Thank God, my Bey<i>.</i>

02:05:22.251 --> 02:05:25.611
Thanks to you, brother Turgut's
loneliness has come to an end.

02:05:25.851 --> 02:05:28.931
There'll be twice the joy
once we take over the castle.

02:05:30.371 --> 02:05:32.171
I hope so, Bamsi. I hope so.

02:05:34.291 --> 02:05:38.291
-Is everything ready, Artuk Bey?
-Everything's ready, my Bey<i>.</i>

02:05:38.451 --> 02:05:40.771
The alps in the castle
are awaiting their orders.

02:05:41.371 --> 02:05:42.371
Very well.

02:05:44.011 --> 02:05:46.491
Come on then, alps! Let's be on our way.

02:06:12.651 --> 02:06:13.651
Turgut Alp?

02:06:15.331 --> 02:06:16.331
What's wrong?

02:06:18.931 --> 02:06:20.091
Ertuğrul Bey!

02:06:23.851 --> 02:06:25.091
Ertuğrul Bey!

02:06:30.371 --> 02:06:31.371
Turgut.

02:06:33.651 --> 02:06:34.651
Turgut Alp?

02:06:46.371 --> 02:06:49.531
-Turgut!
-Turgut! Brother!

02:06:52.331 --> 02:06:53.331
Turgut!

02:06:54.331 --> 02:06:55.571
Turgut, what happened?

02:06:55.771 --> 02:06:58.251
Turgut! My Turgut! My Turgut!

02:06:58.851 --> 02:07:01.091
My Turgut, what happened to you?

02:07:02.211 --> 02:07:06.171
Brother Turgut! Turgut! My Bey!
Artuk Bey! My Bey!

02:07:06.331 --> 02:07:08.771
Do something, my Bey.
Artuk Bey, do something!

02:07:09.491 --> 02:07:10.611
God!

02:07:18.321 --> 02:07:19.521
Turgut, come on.

02:07:20.361 --> 02:07:21.321
Aslıhan?

02:07:22.161 --> 02:07:25.041
Run to their tent, Halime. Quickly! Run!

02:07:25.161 --> 02:07:28.041
Turgut, stay with me!
Get yourself together, Turgut!

02:07:28.521 --> 02:07:29.761
Brother! Brother!

02:07:30.161 --> 02:07:32.481
Pull yourself together, brother.
What's happened to you?

02:07:37.321 --> 02:07:39.521
Aslıhan! Aslıhan!

02:07:40.561 --> 02:07:42.761
Aslıhan, what have they done to you,
sister?

02:07:43.201 --> 02:07:46.641
-What happened?
-Aslıhan? My girl!

02:07:47.201 --> 02:07:48.801
Aslıhan! My girl!

02:07:48.961 --> 02:07:49.961
Gently, gently!

02:07:50.081 --> 02:07:51.081
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.</i>

02:07:51.481 --> 02:07:52.841
<i>Bismillahirrahmanirrahim! </i>My girl.

02:07:53.041 --> 02:07:55.001
-Aslıhan?
-Open your eyes, my girl.

02:07:55.241 --> 02:07:56.481
Quickly, loosen her clothes.

02:08:00.081 --> 02:08:03.921
My girl. Aslıhan! My girl!

02:08:04.161 --> 02:08:06.281
Come back to us, sister!

02:08:08.658 --> 02:08:16.607
Hang in there, for God's sake. 
-Hang in there!
 -My Bey<i>, </i>he's been poisoned.

02:08:17.414 --> 02:08:19.774
God! Poison, he says! My Bey!

02:08:20.358 --> 02:08:21.827
-Turgut!

02:08:41.155 --> 02:08:41.958
Turgut!

02:08:42.603 --> 02:08:43.186
Brother!

02:08:44.116 --> 02:08:45.255
Turgut!
