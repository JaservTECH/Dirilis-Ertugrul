12:21.062 --> 12:24.062
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:25.200 --> 12:28.200

THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:29.265 --> 12:31.266
Kayi Tent

12:34.699 --> 12:36.066
Help me!

12:36.899 --> 12:38.566
Help me!

12:40.699 --> 12:43.566
Please help! Gundogdu!

12:44.699 --> 12:45.699
Selcan Hatun!

12:45.766 --> 12:49.766
Hamza, go and get help!
Gundogdu is dying!

12:59.732 --> 13:00.932
Ertugrul Bey!

13:03.099 --> 13:04.299
Ertugrul Bey!

13:05.266 --> 13:06.266
What is it, Hamza?

13:06.332 --> 13:09.899
Gundogdu Bey is dying.
I am going let Suleyman Shah know.

13:22.799 --> 13:23.799
Brother!

13:23.866 --> 13:24.999
Brother!

13:25.732 --> 13:26.732
Brother!

13:26.799 --> 13:28.799
Selcan, what happened to my brother?

13:28.866 --> 13:32.732
I found him like that. Please save him.

13:34.099 --> 13:38.366
Do not let him die. God take my life!

13:38.732 --> 13:41.232
-What is it? Ertugrul, what is it?
-Hamza...

13:41.299 --> 13:43.099
Let us carry him to Akcakoca's.

13:43.166 --> 13:46.166
-Tell the Alps to bring a stretcher.
-Yes, Bey.

13:46.266 --> 13:49.132
God, take my life instead of his!

13:49.232 --> 13:51.132
Mother, take her out.

13:51.232 --> 13:54.599
-No, I am not going anywhere!
-Come on, brother.

13:55.099 --> 13:58.666
-No! Please do not die!
-Selcan!

13:59.099 --> 14:01.266
Come on, brother.

14:01.332 --> 14:04.066
Come on!

14:08.066 --> 14:09.332
Press on him!

14:20.199 --> 14:21.666
Son!

14:21.732 --> 14:24.099
-Gundogdu!
-Come on, brother! Press!

14:27.199 --> 14:28.266
Son!

14:33.366 --> 14:35.599
Son, do not give up.

14:35.699 --> 14:39.066
My brave son. Hang in there.
Do not give up.

14:44.632 --> 14:46.032
He will be alright.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.999
-My girl...
-Let go of me!

14:51.066 --> 14:54.032
Selcan, let them do their work!

14:54.366 --> 14:56.632
Selcan, wait.

14:56.699 --> 14:58.232
-Hold on, girl.
-Gundogdu!

14:58.332 --> 14:59.766
Gundogdu!

14:59.832 --> 15:01.932
-Selcan!
-Gundogdu!

15:01.999 --> 15:04.366
What happened to him?
What did you do to him?

15:04.599 --> 15:06.932
Do not worry. He is breathing.

15:08.366 --> 15:12.266
-Selcan, wait, you are going to fall!
-Gundogdu!

15:12.699 --> 15:13.866
Selcan!

15:19.032 --> 15:22.232
Ertugrul and Halime
gave the breath he lost back.

15:22.999 --> 15:26.166
Relax. Go to your tent with Mother Hayme.

15:26.232 --> 15:27.799
Pull yourself together.

15:27.866 --> 15:31.932
-We are already in a lot of pain.
-Let them do their work.

15:31.999 --> 15:35.066
-Come on, let us go.
-No!

15:35.232 --> 15:39.032
-I will stay by him. Let go of me!
-Selcan!

15:39.199 --> 15:42.566
-No you cannot!
-I will stay by him!

15:42.632 --> 15:44.032
Selcan!

15:45.599 --> 15:46.932
Help me.

15:49.032 --> 15:51.766
-Selcan Hatun.
-Selcan Hatun.

15:54.899 --> 15:56.299
Let go of me.

15:57.766 --> 15:59.799
It is okay.

16:00.566 --> 16:03.266
-Let me go, mother.
-Selcan, it is okay.

16:03.332 --> 16:05.966
-Come on.
-Let me go.

16:21.599 --> 16:23.232
Come on, girl. Come on.

16:24.266 --> 16:28.632
So, you wanted to play a game with me,
Suleyman Shah and his sons.

16:28.699 --> 16:31.932
I will show you what it means
to play with Kurdoglu.

17:17.132 --> 17:18.132
What is it?

17:18.199 --> 17:21.632
Gundogdu's Alp, Hamza
saw me getting out of the tent.

17:22.099 --> 17:23.166
He can go to hell.

17:23.232 --> 17:25.632
Allow me and I kill him, too.

17:25.766 --> 17:27.332
Or I will be in trouble eventually.

17:27.566 --> 17:30.366
No. We will draw more attention that way.

17:30.599 --> 17:32.232
You will go to Duru Su Pass.

17:32.299 --> 17:34.299
I will send them there
if they come after you.

17:34.366 --> 17:36.599
How can I fight them by myself, Bey?

17:36.666 --> 17:38.832
Do not worry. You will not be alone.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.832
I will ensure your safety.

17:51.599 --> 17:53.566
And here is your award.

18:16.799 --> 18:18.566
Gundogdu!

18:18.699 --> 18:20.266
Selcan...

18:20.732 --> 18:22.232
Selcan, my girl...

18:23.599 --> 18:25.566
Gundogdu is in safe hands.

18:26.232 --> 18:28.632
But you must pull yourself together.

18:29.632 --> 18:32.199
What happened to my man, mother?

18:32.266 --> 18:37.299
Such a strong man,
withered up like an autumn leave.

18:38.632 --> 18:40.566
We will find out about it.

18:40.799 --> 18:42.299
Just some patience.

18:44.132 --> 18:47.332
First my Gokce, then my Gundogdu.

18:48.599 --> 18:50.199
What happened to us, mother?

18:50.266 --> 18:52.299
I am begging you, tell me.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.766
Selcan...

18:56.866 --> 19:00.966
...do not let your anger poison you.

19:06.099 --> 19:10.799
I remember the day
you came to the marquee with Gokce.

19:14.799 --> 19:16.599
We were scared.

19:18.566 --> 19:20.866
I was a child.

19:20.966 --> 19:22.632
We were lonely.

19:22.699 --> 19:24.832
We were desperate.

19:24.899 --> 19:27.599
You brought us up like your own children.

19:28.799 --> 19:30.599
You did not leave us alone.

19:34.666 --> 19:39.999
I did not want to increase
hatred with hatred and grudge with grudge.

19:41.799 --> 19:44.932
I brought up two rosebuds instead.

19:46.166 --> 19:50.166
I had four children before,
and with you, I had six.

19:50.232 --> 19:54.299
We laughed together, we cried together.

19:57.699 --> 19:59.099
Sister!

20:00.599 --> 20:01.932
Gokce...

20:02.599 --> 20:03.932
Gokce...

20:13.599 --> 20:15.366
What kind of evil is this?

21:09.199 --> 21:12.099
I think my brother has been poisoned.

21:12.166 --> 21:14.699
That is my suspicion, as well.

21:15.266 --> 21:16.766
But how?

21:21.366 --> 21:24.299
There must be something in his tent.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.632
His tent?

21:33.266 --> 21:34.699
Halime!

21:43.999 --> 21:45.966
Let me give him some water.

21:59.829 --> 22:01.562
Selcan...

22:01.662 --> 22:03.562
Here, drink some water.

22:03.662 --> 22:05.495
Come on, baby.

22:16.462 --> 22:18.862
No! Do not drink that water!

22:27.729 --> 22:30.295
The water may be poisoned, mother.

22:30.362 --> 22:31.795
Kurdoglu!

22:32.395 --> 22:34.895
Mother, I am begging you, wait.

22:35.129 --> 22:36.695
Let us be sure first.

22:38.262 --> 22:40.495
Still waiting to be sure?

23:01.562 --> 23:02.829
Ertugrul?

23:04.562 --> 23:05.695
What happened?

23:05.762 --> 23:09.129
I will find out
if my brother has been poisoned.

23:11.862 --> 23:13.595
Gundogdu Bey...

23:13.662 --> 23:15.862
Gundogdu Bey... Is he alright, Bey?

23:15.929 --> 23:18.929
I do not know, Dogan.
Thankfully, he is breathing.

23:19.162 --> 23:22.129
Bey, is there anything
you want to say to us?

23:22.229 --> 23:23.829
Find me a goat, Bamsi.

23:25.629 --> 23:27.362
I will be in the stable.

23:36.429 --> 23:37.929
Why are you still here?

23:38.162 --> 23:39.762
I am thinking what I will do.

23:39.829 --> 23:42.562
Has Bey not told you to find a goat?

23:42.629 --> 23:46.662
-There is something in his mind, right?
-Of course. Why do you ask?

23:47.528 --> 23:51.429
-Stop it, you confused me more now.
Come on, move! Be quick.

23:52.295 --> 23:53.695
Dogan...

23:57.629 --> 24:00.729
There is something
I want to talk to Ertugrul Bey.

24:00.795 --> 24:02.462
Come here.

24:05.829 --> 24:07.695
What is going on, Bey?

24:08.295 --> 24:12.329
-Is it true what they say about Gundogdu?
-What kind of illness is this?

24:12.395 --> 24:15.562
A very healthy man
suddenly loses his breath.

24:16.229 --> 24:19.795
I do not know how a heathy man
falls into this situation...

24:20.729 --> 24:23.295
There is a catch here, Karabudak.

24:24.362 --> 24:25.729
What do you mean, Bey?

24:26.929 --> 24:30.429
-Do you mean...
-I would expect anything from this tent...

24:30.495 --> 24:34.895
...as long as the Bey is Suleyman
and the poison on his tongue is Ertugrul.

24:35.129 --> 24:40.129
This will not go on with a father
who cannot take care of his sons.

24:40.429 --> 24:41.562
You are right, Bey.

24:41.629 --> 24:45.695
But I do not know if there is
a brave man to bite the date...

24:46.762 --> 24:51.529
...which has ripened and
is waiting to be bitten on the tree.

24:51.595 --> 24:54.329
This matter will be closed sooner or
later.

24:55.429 --> 24:57.795
Beys will have to choose their sides.

24:59.329 --> 25:02.229
One way or another,
this matter will be closed.

25:03.762 --> 25:05.429
We are with you, Bey.

25:05.495 --> 25:07.862
We are with you, Bey.

25:08.629 --> 25:10.695
Wait to hear from me, then.

25:11.162 --> 25:12.562
Keep your eyes open.

25:25.595 --> 25:27.695
I am sorry, Selcan Hatun.

25:30.462 --> 25:33.462
They say that Ertugrul and you
saved Gundogdu's life.

25:34.662 --> 25:37.362
He did what was necessary,
and I helped him.

25:38.695 --> 25:40.529
How is my son?

25:40.929 --> 25:43.162
The midwives are doing what is necessary.

25:43.262 --> 25:45.429
Let us wait for them to do their job.

25:45.495 --> 25:48.162
If that water was really poisoned...

25:49.195 --> 25:51.529
...you saved my life, Halime.

25:52.795 --> 25:55.229
I hope it was not poisoned.

25:55.829 --> 25:57.229
What if it was?

25:58.195 --> 26:01.662
It means that even harder days
are waiting for the tent.

26:04.562 --> 26:06.429
God help us all.

26:07.795 --> 26:08.895
Excuse me.

26:09.129 --> 26:10.462
Let me go.

26:53.229 --> 26:54.629
I am scared, father.

26:56.329 --> 26:58.795
He looks like...

26:58.895 --> 27:01.129
...he relapsed.

27:02.895 --> 27:05.662
Patience, my daughter. Patience.

27:24.795 --> 27:26.729
Thankfully, he is alive.

27:27.895 --> 27:30.295
Isadora turned out to be wrong.

27:33.562 --> 27:37.529
Look how he struggles to survive.

27:39.595 --> 27:42.529
If anybody else
went through what he did...

27:43.362 --> 27:45.629
...he was long dead.

27:48.795 --> 27:54.129
It is his love to you
that keeps him alive.

27:59.795 --> 28:03.129
Something happened to Gundogdu.
Go and check him out.

28:03.762 --> 28:05.562
I will look after Turgut.

28:05.629 --> 28:07.195
Alright, father.

28:07.262 --> 28:08.795
I am going right away.

28:19.795 --> 28:21.929
Turgut...

28:23.495 --> 28:25.129
Son...

28:26.529 --> 28:31.862
Look, you are the only person
I have in this world.

28:33.162 --> 28:36.795
You are my brave son whom I can trust.

28:39.762 --> 28:43.129
Think about it,
if anything happens to you...

28:44.429 --> 28:46.595
...what would Aykiz do?

28:49.762 --> 28:53.362
Come on, my brave son.
Break that cage.

28:54.429 --> 28:56.795
Break it and come back to us.

28:56.862 --> 28:59.895
Spring has come and passed.

29:00.395 --> 29:02.862
But we could not do your wedding yet.

29:05.529 --> 29:06.829
Alright.

29:06.895 --> 29:08.295
Alright.

29:09.229 --> 29:10.729
Break that cage, son.

29:12.629 --> 29:14.129
Come back to us.

29:19.762 --> 29:22.529
Alright, Turgut. Alright.

29:29.262 --> 29:30.695
Hamza, what did Sarikayin say?

29:30.762 --> 29:35.129
He said that he brought the things
Selcan Hatun brought to the tent.

29:37.629 --> 29:39.729
Get a bowl and let us test this water.

29:39.829 --> 29:41.162
Yes, Bey.

30:10.162 --> 30:12.529
He did not drink the water.

30:15.762 --> 30:17.862
The water is contaminated.

30:18.729 --> 30:19.862
Poisoned.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.362
Sarikayin.

30:31.429 --> 30:33.462
Let us bring him to you, Bey.

30:33.529 --> 30:37.729
Be careful.
If Kurdoglu finds out about it...

30:37.795 --> 30:41.495
...he will not let him live
just like Baybora.

30:43.129 --> 30:44.829
Do not tell this to anybody.

30:44.895 --> 30:46.329
Yes, Bey.

30:46.395 --> 30:47.629
Bamsi, come on.

30:54.629 --> 30:56.362
Let us keep this a secret.

30:56.462 --> 30:57.695
Understood, Bey.

30:57.762 --> 30:59.795
I will not even tell Selcan Hatun.

30:59.895 --> 31:03.462
Good.
Do not leave my brother alone.

31:03.529 --> 31:04.662
Of course, Bey.

31:12.362 --> 31:13.562
Yigit...

31:23.595 --> 31:24.929
Where is this boy?

31:35.929 --> 31:38.329
Halime!

31:38.429 --> 31:39.895
What is it?

31:42.295 --> 31:43.729
I cannot find Yigit.

31:44.762 --> 31:47.695
I asked every child,
and looked at every place.

31:48.295 --> 31:50.295
What is it? Is something wrong?

31:52.462 --> 31:54.829
I was going to give him the good news.

31:54.929 --> 31:57.629
But it will be you who hears it first.

31:57.695 --> 31:58.929
Do you mean...

31:59.695 --> 32:01.295
Yes!

32:01.595 --> 32:02.862
Halime...

32:09.495 --> 32:12.729
Suleyman Shah allowed
Ertugrul and me to get married.

32:16.929 --> 32:18.829
But Gundogdu Bey...

32:20.229 --> 32:22.329
...is struggling with death.

32:35.162 --> 32:36.662
So, Gundogdu did not die.

32:38.229 --> 32:39.729
It is Ertugrul again.

32:40.629 --> 32:42.829
You could not succeed one more time.

32:43.529 --> 32:47.462
Do not worry. The Shahzade
will bring Ertugrul to you.

32:48.329 --> 32:50.395
Gundogdu is struggling with death.

32:51.162 --> 32:53.729
If you keep your promises...

32:54.595 --> 32:59.362
...there will be no better opportunity
to kick Suleyman out of his marquee.

32:59.429 --> 33:02.562
Kurdoglu, this is your last chance.

33:03.362 --> 33:06.262
It is the last chance
for all of us, Titus.

33:06.329 --> 33:08.162
I will lose my head unless I succeed.

33:08.229 --> 33:13.162
But you should know that, that father and
son will bring your castle down on you...

33:13.229 --> 33:16.229
...sooner or later if I cannot succeed.

33:17.295 --> 33:20.695
So, both of us needs each other.

33:24.195 --> 33:26.529
We will not leave you alone.

33:26.595 --> 33:28.895
You know we keep our promises.

33:29.495 --> 33:31.829
Do not worry.

33:34.529 --> 33:38.462
Take this present to Turgut Alp.

33:44.195 --> 33:45.529
Alright.

33:47.495 --> 33:49.695
I have one last request from you.

33:51.662 --> 33:53.262
Kill Sarikayin.

33:53.329 --> 33:58.262
Kill him, so that I will not be the one
to carry the blame of being a traitor.

34:30.262 --> 34:31.329
Aykiz...

34:36.595 --> 34:37.795
Aykiz...

34:55.362 --> 34:56.695
Bamsi...

35:01.395 --> 35:02.662
Dogan...

35:03.895 --> 35:06.329
Brother, I cannot find your wound!

35:11.195 --> 35:12.629
Brother Turgut...

35:12.695 --> 35:14.529
Are you alright, brother?

35:15.229 --> 35:16.662
Brother...

35:20.695 --> 35:22.129
Brother...

35:26.829 --> 35:28.295
You were my brother.

35:28.429 --> 35:31.195
And you will always
be my brother, Turgut Alp .

35:31.262 --> 35:32.529
Brother...

35:38.262 --> 35:39.695
Brother...

35:41.562 --> 35:43.229
Aykiz...

35:45.195 --> 35:46.462
Bamsi...

35:47.795 --> 35:49.229
Dogan...

35:50.662 --> 35:52.162
Brother!

36:49.762 --> 36:51.595
My first child.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.228
My Gundogdu.

36:55.262 --> 36:59.695
Hopefully, he will overcome this
with God's help.

37:02.329 --> 37:04.295
Hang on, son.

37:04.462 --> 37:05.862
Hang on, my brave son.

37:06.895 --> 37:10.162
Hopefully. Bey, hopefully.

38:03.929 --> 38:05.695
What is it, Ertugrul?

38:05.762 --> 38:07.562
Are you waiting for me to come back?

38:07.629 --> 38:09.829
Where are you coming from, uncle?

38:10.629 --> 38:14.129
Alps are everywhere.
Why? You know it.

38:14.795 --> 38:17.662
It is because of the troubles
you have caused.

38:18.329 --> 38:23.562
They keep watch for us,
and I do my duty on them.

38:28.762 --> 38:30.762
How is Gundogdu? Did he recover?

38:50.462 --> 38:53.829
Do you hold me responsible
for Gundogdu's illness, boy?

38:54.829 --> 39:00.295
So, you will hold me responsible even if
goat dung gets stuck in somebody's throat.

39:00.362 --> 39:04.562
Your elder brother proved me innocent
in the marquee, in front of all the beys.

39:04.629 --> 39:08.295
But you are about to lose your mind
because of your delusions.

39:08.362 --> 39:10.462
When will this suspicion in you go away?

39:10.529 --> 39:13.595
It will not,
until you pay for what you have done.

39:43.562 --> 39:44.695
Bey...

39:44.762 --> 39:48.495
They say that Sarikayin went to
Dar Su Pass to grass the cattle.

39:48.562 --> 39:49.795
Good.

39:49.895 --> 39:52.562
Go. Do not come back without him.

39:53.395 --> 39:54.595
Yes, Bey.

40:45.729 --> 40:47.229
Bey...

40:48.595 --> 40:50.129
Leave us alone.

41:06.395 --> 41:09.362
I hope your son gets well soon.

41:10.229 --> 41:12.662
Your son Ertugrul blames me.

41:12.729 --> 41:15.762
He holds me responsible
even for Gundogdu's illness.

41:15.829 --> 41:19.929
If you are responsible for that,
you will surely die, Kurdoglu.

41:23.295 --> 41:25.195
Shame on you, Suleyman.

41:26.795 --> 41:31.629
Gundogdu proved me innocent
in front of all the beys in the marquee.

41:32.429 --> 41:35.229
I was brave enough
to be a candidate against you.

41:35.295 --> 41:37.262
I lost and showed respect.

41:39.529 --> 41:41.729
Gundogdu is like my son.

41:42.929 --> 41:46.462
I see him as my son I have lost.

41:46.529 --> 41:48.195
I love him this way.

41:48.295 --> 41:50.929
How can you still be suspicious of me?

41:51.229 --> 41:52.329
Open your eyes.

41:52.395 --> 41:56.429
There are people in this tent
who want to provoke you against me.

41:56.495 --> 41:57.929
See this reality!

41:59.429 --> 42:01.629
Or the price will be high.

42:04.195 --> 42:07.662
Are you talking about
paying prices, Kurdoglu?

42:09.295 --> 42:12.829
Do you what keeps me calm
even under this situation?

42:14.629 --> 42:18.595
The reason for me not nailing your head
on the poles of the tent?

42:19.495 --> 42:24.762
I am worried that justice will be hurt
if I take your head without trying you.

42:25.762 --> 42:28.429
But you should know that...

42:28.495 --> 42:32.295
...if it gets proven that
you are behind this...

42:32.362 --> 42:34.729
...death will be a prize for you.

42:54.529 --> 42:55.929
Gunkut!

42:59.695 --> 43:00.829
Yes, Bey.

43:00.895 --> 43:03.262
I am giving you an important duty.

43:04.195 --> 43:06.629
You will tell me
every step Kurdoglu takes.

43:06.695 --> 43:08.595
You will keep your eyes on him.

43:53.395 --> 43:57.362
If that snake's head
is under this stone...

43:58.462 --> 44:01.629
...it is my duty to rip that head off.

44:04.362 --> 44:06.895
First, my dear sister...

44:07.129 --> 44:08.362
...and now, you.

44:12.795 --> 44:14.329
Selcan...

44:17.829 --> 44:20.462
May Selcan sacrifice her life for you.

44:22.262 --> 44:24.762
The pole of my tent.

44:24.829 --> 44:26.695
The man of my heart.

44:29.829 --> 44:34.295
I am with you. I will not leave you
until death does us apart.

44:35.629 --> 44:37.462
Say it, Bey.

44:39.395 --> 44:41.129
Selcan...

44:42.329 --> 44:43.795
Gundogdu...

44:44.662 --> 44:46.629
Gundogdu...

44:46.695 --> 44:48.495
Gundogdu...

44:48.595 --> 44:50.162
Gundogdu...

45:02.562 --> 45:04.895
How did I grow this anger inside me...

45:05.129 --> 45:10.762
...in that great marquee,
besides this holy man?

45:30.595 --> 45:33.195
Who is this Sarikayin, father?

45:33.295 --> 45:36.362
He lives in the boundary of the tent.
He does not even have a tent to live in.

45:37.362 --> 45:39.429
He sleeps together with animals.

45:39.495 --> 45:42.429
You mean a bastard
whom anybody can buy.

45:42.495 --> 45:46.562
If Hamza saw him going out of the tent,
he must have ran away.

45:46.829 --> 45:48.795
We can never find him.

45:49.929 --> 45:52.529
Father, Kurdoglu got this done.

45:52.629 --> 45:55.529
He is innocent until we prove that.

45:55.629 --> 45:59.362
So, we have to prove it
as soon as we can.

46:52.229 --> 46:54.162
Selcan, my girl...

46:56.395 --> 46:58.362
Day comes out of the morning.

46:59.862 --> 47:02.395
And the day gets born into the tongue.

47:04.129 --> 47:08.462
Blessings rain
when a branch lowers its head.

47:10.695 --> 47:14.329
You got rid of the anger
and hatred inside you.

47:15.162 --> 47:17.229
Clean your heart...

47:17.829 --> 47:21.195
...so that blessings will rain over you.

47:24.929 --> 47:27.529
My dear mother. My life.

47:28.462 --> 47:34.295
This tongue and this heart
will clean theirselves from now on.

48:13.929 --> 48:15.662
Go away!

48:17.529 --> 48:18.795
Go!

48:20.129 --> 48:21.595
I said, go!

48:21.695 --> 48:23.195
You do not exist!

48:25.662 --> 48:26.862
Go, father. Go.

48:26.929 --> 48:29.195
It is all because of you!

48:30.562 --> 48:32.462
Go away! Go!

48:41.595 --> 48:44.262
Can you forgive me, Gundogdu?

48:45.929 --> 48:49.295
Even if you can, will Gokce forgive me?

48:49.829 --> 48:51.895
What about God?

48:52.529 --> 48:54.729
Will God forgive me?

48:56.229 --> 48:59.929
I would be ashamed to enter heaven...

49:00.195 --> 49:03.629
...with all the burden of my sins
on my back.

49:06.595 --> 49:09.562
What have I done?

49:09.662 --> 49:11.695
How could I be so blind?

49:19.595 --> 49:21.195
Sel...

49:22.395 --> 49:23.762
Gundogdu!

49:24.629 --> 49:26.229
My Gundogdu.

49:37.395 --> 49:39.762
You will pay for this, Kurdoglu.

49:46.395 --> 49:49.329
All the beys that we have been praising...

49:50.829 --> 49:53.495
The ones that said "The world is mine".

49:54.862 --> 49:58.595
The time of death took it,
while earth hid it.

49:59.895 --> 50:03.129
Who stayed forever in this world?

50:04.495 --> 50:06.829
The world with ups and down.

50:08.495 --> 50:11.795
The world in which
you are meant to die in the end.

50:44.895 --> 50:46.662
Greetings.

50:46.729 --> 50:49.762
Greetings, Halime Sultan.
Would you like me to prepare your horse?

50:49.829 --> 50:52.295
No, thank you.
I am looking for my brother.

50:52.362 --> 50:54.395
I could not find his horse in the stable.

50:54.462 --> 50:56.362
Shahzade went away riding.

50:57.129 --> 50:58.629
Did he say where he was going?

50:58.729 --> 51:00.695
He did not say anything.

51:00.762 --> 51:03.362
But I saw him going towards Kel Tepe.

51:12.429 --> 51:14.862
I am getting Kurdoglu followed.

51:15.129 --> 51:17.295
You find Sarikayin. Be quick.

51:17.362 --> 51:19.295
Bamsi and Dogan are after him.

51:19.362 --> 51:21.462
I do not trust anybody anymore.

51:22.362 --> 51:26.162
Be suspicious of everybody
and everything from now on.

51:35.195 --> 51:37.329
Halime Sultan...

51:37.395 --> 51:39.329
...wants to talk to Ertugrul Bey.

51:39.395 --> 51:41.195
Let her in.

51:44.762 --> 51:46.262
Suleyman Shah...

51:46.495 --> 51:47.762
Ertugrul Bey...

51:49.695 --> 51:51.762
Forgive me, I could not wait.

51:53.629 --> 51:54.929
Yigit...

51:56.462 --> 51:58.529
I cannot find my brother.
He is gone.

51:59.762 --> 52:01.662
What are you saying, Halime Sultan?

52:01.729 --> 52:03.329
Where did he go?

52:04.429 --> 52:07.895
He has been talking about
taking my father's revenge since he died.

52:08.162 --> 52:11.595
He got on his horse,
girded on his weapon and went away.

52:11.662 --> 52:14.395
The groom said
he went towards Kel Tepe.

52:23.829 --> 52:27.129
What is it, Kurdoglu?
Why do you look troubled?

52:28.295 --> 52:32.762
Suleyman Shah holds me responsible
for my niece getting poisoned.

52:34.562 --> 52:37.462
He will relieve me of my duties
in the tent...

52:37.929 --> 52:40.329
...and look for a chance to get rid of me.

52:40.695 --> 52:42.795
We will not let this happen.

52:45.129 --> 52:46.895
Our Bey is Suleyman Shah.

52:47.762 --> 52:50.229
I took my lesson in the election.

52:51.162 --> 52:54.862
The only thing I want
is that the traitor is found.

52:56.662 --> 52:59.829
I do not want to be called
a traitor in this age.

53:05.595 --> 53:10.829
If the beys cannot see the truth,
there are many ways to make them see it.

53:12.129 --> 53:14.462
I have only one truth.

53:15.895 --> 53:19.762
I want peace
in these last days of my life.

55:15.362 --> 55:17.329
You sold me out, Kurdoglu!

56:00.262 --> 56:01.262
Tell me!

56:02.162 --> 56:04.862
Tell me!
Who is the traitor in the tent?

56:04.929 --> 56:07.729
Talk, you bastard!
Who did he make you kill?

56:20.762 --> 56:22.629
What are we going to do now?

56:27.895 --> 56:29.762
Get up. You could not hold a man!

58:00.229 --> 58:02.395
Even if he went to Konya...

58:02.495 --> 58:04.829
...we will send a messenger
to Sultan Alaeddin.

58:04.895 --> 58:07.829
He promised us.
He will watch out for him.

58:08.462 --> 58:11.162
He will prevent him do something silly.

58:11.262 --> 58:13.495
This is what I am scared of.

58:13.729 --> 58:15.529
Him doing something silly.

58:25.295 --> 58:26.729
What is it, Ertugrul Bey?

58:53.495 --> 58:54.729
This is Yigit's horse.

58:55.262 --> 58:56.562
Are you sure?

59:00.462 --> 59:02.862
It has a rider with Yigit's weight.

59:03.462 --> 59:07.295
The horseshoes are one of those
which Wild Demir has made.

59:08.862 --> 59:10.929
He came here with two riders.

59:21.895 --> 59:24.262
Then three more riders came.

59:30.829 --> 59:32.795
They are not from our tent.

59:35.529 --> 59:37.229
They are not even Muslim.

59:45.562 --> 59:49.329
These horseshoes are not
one of those Wild Demir made.

59:50.362 --> 59:54.562
The ones coming from the tent
must be the traitor or his men.

59:56.695 --> 59:59.529
They handed Yigit to them
and went back to our tent.

01:00:02.229 --> 01:00:04.529
God help my brother...

01:00:21.929 --> 01:00:26.329
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS
THE TEMPLARS' CASTLE

01:00:51.629 --> 01:00:54.429
You Turks are brave people.

01:00:55.695 --> 01:00:58.162
You are too emotional...

01:00:59.129 --> 01:01:03.662
...but do you know
what is worst, my child?

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:09.629
You do not know at all
how to take the opportunities you have.

01:01:11.762 --> 01:01:13.729
What do you want from me?

01:01:13.862 --> 01:01:15.929
Taking what you want.

01:01:18.862 --> 01:01:21.162
Taking your father's revenge.

01:01:22.162 --> 01:01:25.195
You can only take your father's revenge...

01:01:25.262 --> 01:01:28.195
...when you behead Sultan Alaeddin...

01:01:28.662 --> 01:01:31.295
...and hang it in the square of Konya...

01:01:31.395 --> 01:01:35.295
...and come to his throne, Shahzade.

01:01:36.395 --> 01:01:38.829
You know this as well, do you not?

01:01:50.595 --> 01:01:52.862
Treat the Shahzade well.

01:01:54.929 --> 01:01:58.462
I see Seljuks' future in him.

01:01:59.129 --> 01:02:00.829
Good night, Shahzade.

01:02:01.762 --> 01:02:04.695
Brother Ertugrul
will bring this castle down on you.

01:02:04.795 --> 01:02:06.762
Brother Ertugrul?

01:02:08.895 --> 01:02:10.429
Ertugrul...

01:02:14.562 --> 01:02:15.829
Ertugrul.

01:02:22.895 --> 01:02:27.495
I will bury you all
under the lands you were born.

01:02:46.862 --> 01:02:47.895
Yigit?

01:02:48.162 --> 01:02:49.662
-Yigit!
-Isadora?

01:02:49.729 --> 01:02:53.395
-What happened to you?
-I know who the traitor is...

01:02:54.695 --> 01:02:56.295
Let go of him!

01:03:21.862 --> 01:03:24.395
The situation is as I told you.

01:03:24.762 --> 01:03:27.895
He blames me because
he protects Gundogdu...

01:03:28.162 --> 01:03:31.895
...who is from his own blood
just to cover up his mistakes.

01:03:32.629 --> 01:03:35.362
He blames me of cooperating
with the Crusaders...

01:03:35.429 --> 01:03:36.895
...to come into his throne.

01:03:37.162 --> 01:03:38.229
Shame on him!

01:03:38.595 --> 01:03:39.595
This must be a joke.

01:03:39.662 --> 01:03:41.429
Shame on him!

01:03:42.295 --> 01:03:46.529
While Ertugrul brings
every kinds of trouble to our tent...

01:03:46.629 --> 01:03:50.462
...his father turned our tent
into a shepherd's tent.

01:03:50.529 --> 01:03:52.429
You are right, Kurdoglu.

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:56.162
You are right,
but what are we going to do?

01:03:56.229 --> 01:04:00.729
It is not the same old world
that we have known, brothers... Beys.

01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:04.862
Moguls are on one side,
and the Crusaders are on the other.

01:04:04.929 --> 01:04:09.395
And we are digging our graves
by herding goats and shepherding.

01:04:09.795 --> 01:04:13.495
We come from a warrior lineage,
so we can find our own way.

01:04:14.262 --> 01:04:16.762
-Is there anybody who denies his essence?
-There is not, Bey.

01:04:16.829 --> 01:04:18.862
While I am worried about my tent...

01:04:19.129 --> 01:04:23.262
...I am being blamed of being a traitor.
Do I deserve this, brothers?

01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:26.895
They taint my reputation
even though they won the election.

01:04:34.529 --> 01:04:35.762
Alright, enjoy it.

01:04:50.229 --> 01:04:52.529
What are the news, Gunkut?

01:04:52.595 --> 01:04:54.395
Kurdoglu got together with the beys.

01:04:54.462 --> 01:04:56.329
There is nothing wrong
with his loyalty to you.

01:04:56.395 --> 01:05:01.329
He said he only wanted the traitor
to be found as soon as possible.

01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:03.929
Keep on following.

01:05:04.195 --> 01:05:06.829
Keep your eyes on him at all times.

01:05:06.929 --> 01:05:09.629
This may be one of his tricks.

01:05:09.729 --> 01:05:11.462
Of course, Bey.

01:05:17.729 --> 01:05:20.695
If the traitor is not Kurdoglu...

01:05:20.762 --> 01:05:23.329
...who is it, then?

01:05:36.297 --> 01:05:40.264
I just wanted to sleep peacefully
just for one night in my bed.

01:05:44.764 --> 01:05:48.231
I was so happy that
it was going to be this night.

01:05:57.231 --> 01:06:00.697
My heart cannot even accept
that my brother is in the castle.

01:06:01.731 --> 01:06:05.631
How can I tell you
to go and bring him back?

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:14.131
We did not let you, your tent
and us have some peace.

01:06:16.897 --> 01:06:19.231
And now again...

01:06:27.064 --> 01:06:30.964
Neither the armor I wear,
nor the weapon in my hand...

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.097
...It will be you who give me strength.

01:06:36.064 --> 01:06:37.964
Do not say that.

01:06:39.531 --> 01:06:41.664
I will go to that castle tomorrow.

01:06:42.897 --> 01:06:44.897
God knows what will happen...

01:06:47.197 --> 01:06:48.831
...after that.

01:06:51.531 --> 01:06:53.197
Bey, may I come in?

01:06:57.031 --> 01:06:58.631
Come in, Dogan.

01:07:03.697 --> 01:07:06.297
Bey...

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:08.831
...the Templars killed Sarikayin.

01:07:10.731 --> 01:07:12.664
We could not prevent it.

01:07:19.064 --> 01:07:23.731
They must have found out that Hamza
saw him coming out of Gundogdu's tent.

01:07:27.131 --> 01:07:29.764
They did not leave any trace behind.

01:07:30.997 --> 01:07:32.931
Back to the beginning.

01:07:34.264 --> 01:07:36.264
Who is the traitor?

01:08:25.931 --> 01:08:27.197
It was not me!

01:08:28.097 --> 01:08:30.031
Who did this to my Gundogdu?

01:08:30.097 --> 01:08:32.131
Who poisoned him?

01:08:33.331 --> 01:08:37.931
None of us will have peace
as long as Suleyman stays in the marquee!

01:08:54.264 --> 01:08:56.031
Now, get the hell out of here.

01:08:56.097 --> 01:08:59.897
If you come again, I will kill you!

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:04.997
Get out!

01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:55.731
Sister?

01:09:57.831 --> 01:09:59.531
Are you alright?

01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:03.964
I committed very big sins, Gokce.

01:10:05.031 --> 01:10:08.697
God is punishing me for what I have done.

01:10:10.297 --> 01:10:13.564
I will be in trouble in both worlds.

01:10:17.097 --> 01:10:19.031
I know, sister.

01:10:20.197 --> 01:10:22.697
You broke everybody's hearts.

01:10:22.797 --> 01:10:27.297
You threw your elders, your husband
and me, your sister into the fire...

01:10:27.564 --> 01:10:30.931
...in the cause of your ambition.

01:10:35.964 --> 01:10:40.164
Why did you hide the fact that
I will not be a mother?

01:10:42.164 --> 01:10:46.797
You tried to marry me with Ertugrul
even though you knew that.

01:10:48.964 --> 01:10:50.864
Why?

01:10:50.931 --> 01:10:53.031
Forgive me.

01:10:54.297 --> 01:10:58.531
I am begging you, forgive me.

01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:02.297
Please forgive me.

01:11:02.564 --> 01:11:04.631
Forgive me.

01:13:17.964 --> 01:13:20.997
If only we had the mind of those infidels.

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:25.131
They turned a strong Alp
to an Indian macaque.

01:13:26.597 --> 01:13:28.564
Did you wake up, Judas?

01:13:31.964 --> 01:13:33.564
Good.

01:13:36.564 --> 01:13:39.297
We will do great things with you, soon.

01:13:41.064 --> 01:13:44.164
You will be my right arm.

01:14:18.331 --> 01:14:20.664
Bey...

01:14:23.164 --> 01:14:25.897
If you permit...

01:14:30.531 --> 01:14:32.331
My girl...

01:14:37.897 --> 01:14:39.864
This necklace was given to me...

01:14:39.931 --> 01:14:42.997
...by Ertugrul's grandfather Kaya Alp...

01:14:43.097 --> 01:14:46.531
...and his grandmother Burla Hatun.

01:14:53.664 --> 01:14:56.531
And now I want to...

01:14:58.197 --> 01:15:00.731
...give it to my daughter-in-law.

01:15:06.031 --> 01:15:07.697
Mother Hayme, this is very valuable.

01:15:07.797 --> 01:15:09.331
You are very valuable, too.

01:15:09.564 --> 01:15:11.997
You are my daughter now.

01:15:13.197 --> 01:15:15.131
You came here knowing very well...

01:15:15.197 --> 01:15:18.131
...what it means
to be the bride of this marquee.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:20.264
And Ertugrul brought you to us...

01:15:20.331 --> 01:15:24.564
...knowing the difficulties of
marrying a shahzade's daughter.

01:15:24.697 --> 01:15:27.264
Kayis always have trouble
in our marquee.

01:15:27.331 --> 01:15:30.064
And now Seljuks' troubles will add to it.

01:15:31.164 --> 01:15:32.697
It is alright.

01:15:33.297 --> 01:15:35.764
We cherished you knowing that.

01:15:37.597 --> 01:15:41.297
The only thing you will do
is to be resilient.

01:15:42.597 --> 01:15:45.697
Yigit will come back to us
sooner or later.

01:15:58.897 --> 01:16:03.231
I will carry the stamp of Seljuk
and the stamp of Kayi Tribe...

01:16:04.164 --> 01:16:06.564
...with honor, Mother Hayme.

01:16:13.164 --> 01:16:15.597
I hope you bring up so many children...

01:16:15.697 --> 01:16:18.897
...and beys
who will honor our breed.

01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:25.131
If you have sons...

01:16:26.331 --> 01:16:28.964
...I would like you
to name them after...

01:16:29.031 --> 01:16:31.931
...Savci Alp who gave his life for me
while fighting the Moguls...

01:16:32.064 --> 01:16:34.331
...Gunduz Alp
who has been martyred in my arms...

01:16:34.597 --> 01:16:38.531
...and my uncle Osman Alp
who has also been martyred.

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:46.564
I have always wanted the names of these
brave Alps to live on in our breed.

01:16:47.297 --> 01:16:49.597
If we have sons by God's will...

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:51.931
...may the names of these great Alps...

01:16:52.031 --> 01:16:56.697
...bring honor to our breed,
power to our tent and peace to our family.

01:16:59.931 --> 01:17:03.264
-May God grant you happiness.
-Amen, father.

01:17:14.564 --> 01:17:18.797
Come here, girl,
I will show you something else.

01:17:21.031 --> 01:17:25.864
Sarikayin was our single opportunity
to take us to the real traitor.

01:17:27.897 --> 01:17:30.864
The traitor will be revealed
sooner or later.

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:36.031
But I need to find a way to find Yigit,
and bring him back here first.

01:18:01.564 --> 01:18:06.064
It is a gorgeous idea that the Shahzade
will be trained in Konstantinopolis...

01:18:06.164 --> 01:18:08.131
...through the Church's education...

01:18:08.231 --> 01:18:12.064
...and be the sultan of the Seljuks.

01:18:13.264 --> 01:18:15.897
I admire you one more time.

01:18:16.231 --> 01:18:18.297
My dear friend Petruchio...

01:18:18.831 --> 01:18:22.031
...as I stated in the letter
I wrote to the Pope...

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:27.197
...you Templars are the biggest gift that
has been granted to the Christian world.

01:18:28.297 --> 01:18:30.931
My prayers are with you.

01:18:34.731 --> 01:18:40.831
I will give you my best knights
when you set off for Antioch tomorrow.

01:18:41.831 --> 01:18:47.064
I would not like you to have the same
troubles like you did before.

01:18:47.197 --> 01:18:50.064
My dear friend, I would be very glad.

01:18:50.197 --> 01:18:55.097
I would never want to
meet that ominous Turk again.

01:19:06.164 --> 01:19:07.731
Excuse me, uncle.

01:19:07.831 --> 01:19:14.231
Isadora, I am aware that we got you bored
with our political matters.

01:19:15.231 --> 01:19:18.964
Why do you not take a ride?

01:19:19.531 --> 01:19:22.297
But be careful not to get lost again.

01:19:22.531 --> 01:19:24.797
I know everywhere now.
I can go alone.

01:19:24.897 --> 01:19:26.997
Good. Go, then.

01:19:27.264 --> 01:19:32.297
But be careful. Do not cross
those barbarian Kayis' bounders.

01:19:32.564 --> 01:19:34.164
Do not worry, uncle.

01:19:59.897 --> 01:20:01.697
I want to see Shahzade Yigit.

01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:03.731
Master Petruchio has his orders.

01:20:03.831 --> 01:20:05.864
We do not let him see anybody.

01:20:52.897 --> 01:20:54.231
Bring me Ertugrul.

01:21:27.831 --> 01:21:29.564
What is in your mind?

01:21:30.997 --> 01:21:32.264
Kurdoglu, Bey.

01:21:33.164 --> 01:21:38.597
I am worried that he is up for
what Selcan's father could not succeed.

01:21:39.564 --> 01:21:43.931
I will relieve Kurdoglu
off his duties tomorrow.

01:21:46.864 --> 01:21:49.231
I will grant his duties to Ertugrul.

01:22:04.131 --> 01:22:06.797
He neither eats, nor drinks anything.

01:22:07.831 --> 01:22:09.697
He stares blankly.

01:22:11.231 --> 01:22:15.231
He would say my name
and eat a little, a while ago.

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:18.731
Now he does not do anything.

01:22:21.897 --> 01:22:25.231
We are on the richest lands
of the world.

01:22:25.297 --> 01:22:28.631
We have plenty of water,
our animals are battening.

01:22:29.864 --> 01:22:32.997
But we are unpeaceful
like we never have been.

01:22:34.631 --> 01:22:37.564
Was it a mistake that we came down here?

01:22:40.597 --> 01:22:43.797
We will not rest
until we settle in our own lands.

01:22:44.597 --> 01:22:48.164
We draw the people that hate
and want to destroy us...

01:22:48.231 --> 01:22:50.997
...like bugs that fly towards the light.

01:22:58.731 --> 01:23:02.164
Bey... one of the birds
that we keep in the tent...

01:23:02.231 --> 01:23:04.097
...came back with this.

01:23:12.197 --> 01:23:14.164
This is Yigit's necklace.

01:23:40.564 --> 01:23:44.131
My biggest fear was that he would
succumb to the icon of arrogance...

01:23:44.197 --> 01:23:45.664
...and worship it.

01:23:46.997 --> 01:23:49.697
But he brought the icon arrogance down.

01:23:50.031 --> 01:23:54.697
He showed one more time that
he is a son that you would be proud of.

01:23:54.764 --> 01:23:56.731
Our people want a young bey.

01:23:57.697 --> 01:23:59.931
My Gundogdu did great things.

01:24:01.631 --> 01:24:04.964
He tried so hard
for Kurdogdu to be the bey.

01:24:05.097 --> 01:24:10.864
But they would select him instead of me
if he was the candidate.

01:24:12.597 --> 01:24:17.664
But he broke Kurdoglu's game
by not being a candidate.

01:24:21.697 --> 01:24:23.797
And now he is in this situation.

01:24:25.897 --> 01:24:30.631
I will relieve Kurdoglu
off his duties tomorrow.

01:24:33.297 --> 01:24:38.731
I would kill him with my bare hands
if I had only one proof.

01:24:41.931 --> 01:24:43.564
But I do not.

01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:03.131
Obviously, Isadora
found out about something.

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:04.797
She wants to see me.

01:25:04.864 --> 01:25:07.231
Be careful, Bey. It may be a trap.

01:25:08.531 --> 01:25:11.764
We will meet at a place
only the two of us know.

01:25:12.797 --> 01:25:15.131
We determined it while she was here.

01:25:15.197 --> 01:25:17.697
Be careful, anyway.

01:25:17.797 --> 01:25:19.164
Alright.

01:25:20.797 --> 01:25:23.164
Bey, let us come with you.

01:25:23.297 --> 01:25:25.164
This is safer, Bamsi.

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:18.164
I was worried that
you were not going to come.

01:27:18.264 --> 01:27:20.631
-Is Yigit in the castle?
-Yes.

01:27:21.231 --> 01:27:23.664
My uncle succeeded
to get him out of the tent...

01:27:23.731 --> 01:27:25.864
...with the help of the traitor.

01:27:25.997 --> 01:27:28.097
Yigit knows who the traitor is, then.

01:27:28.197 --> 01:27:31.764
You will find out who he is
if you rescue Yigit.

01:27:31.864 --> 01:27:36.164
Yigit shouted at me to tell who is,
but the knights covered his mouth.

01:27:37.231 --> 01:27:40.831
They did not let me see him
when I went to the dungeon.

01:27:42.631 --> 01:27:45.764
How are we going to
get him out of the dungeon?

01:27:45.831 --> 01:27:48.064
It is impossible to get him out.

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:52.864
But he will go to Antioch tomorrow
with Cardinal Thomas.

01:27:52.997 --> 01:27:54.797
And then to Konstantiniyye.

01:27:54.864 --> 01:27:58.664
They will use Yigit
to bring Seljuks down from the inside.

01:28:57.764 --> 01:28:59.897
Brother, I do not understand.

01:28:59.997 --> 01:29:02.797
You know who your enemy is
in the battlefield.

01:29:02.864 --> 01:29:04.697
You either die or kill.

01:29:05.064 --> 01:29:07.064
What kind of field is this?

01:29:07.164 --> 01:29:11.197
You do not know who the sword will slash,
or from where the arrow will come.

01:29:11.297 --> 01:29:17.597
The man you apparently share your belief
with betrays on you, and you fight him.

01:29:18.897 --> 01:29:20.897
This is the biggest enemy.

01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:30.564
Ertugrul Bey is here.

01:29:34.564 --> 01:29:38.131
Get ready.
We are setting off for Antioch tomorrow.

01:29:40.297 --> 01:29:42.531
Is there news from Yigit, Bey?

01:29:42.631 --> 01:29:45.064
They are planning to take the Shahzade
to Konstantiniyye...

01:29:45.131 --> 01:29:47.531
...and cause trouble for Seljuks.

01:30:20.931 --> 01:30:26.297
Sir, thank God I became a Muslim
with your help.

01:30:28.664 --> 01:30:31.231
I will owe you all my life.

01:30:32.764 --> 01:30:35.064
I wanted to kill you...

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:38.764
...but you caused me to become Muslim.

01:30:38.897 --> 01:30:43.031
And then started to see me as your son
instead of taking a revenge.

01:30:44.231 --> 01:30:49.197
Son, the only cause is God.
Man is only a tool.

01:30:51.031 --> 01:30:53.331
You should thank God.

01:30:53.564 --> 01:30:56.597
Thank him, so that
he will complete his blessing...

01:30:56.697 --> 01:30:59.064
...and accepts you as a believer.

01:31:00.897 --> 01:31:03.231
When God wants to create something...

01:31:04.164 --> 01:31:07.331
...everything is at his service.

01:31:07.597 --> 01:31:10.864
He creates
known and unknown tools for that.

01:31:10.964 --> 01:31:14.031
Just for his wish to be realized.

01:31:15.931 --> 01:31:18.197
Our holy Prophet taught us that...

01:31:18.297 --> 01:31:21.931
...the greatest blessing in life is Islam.

01:31:23.631 --> 01:31:28.697
Sir, I feel that I owe you,
and I am embarrassed to you.

01:31:29.197 --> 01:31:32.731
Even though I became a Muslim,
it is hard for me to forget the past.

01:31:32.831 --> 01:31:35.764
I remember my mistakes
one by one.

01:31:35.997 --> 01:31:38.264
I feel like I cannot breath.

01:31:38.531 --> 01:31:41.664
Whenever I look at your face...

01:31:41.731 --> 01:31:44.964
...I remember my past
in which I was a killer.

01:31:46.597 --> 01:31:50.997
Son, becoming a Muslim erases the past.

01:31:51.931 --> 01:31:54.731
Whatever you live in the past...

01:31:54.831 --> 01:31:58.597
...you start a new life
when you become a Muslim.

01:31:58.697 --> 01:32:00.964
You start to live
although you were dead before.

01:32:01.031 --> 01:32:03.097
You gain a new name.

01:32:03.897 --> 01:32:08.297
God erased your past.
You forget it as well.

01:32:08.564 --> 01:32:09.831
Do not live with the past.

01:32:09.897 --> 01:32:14.264
The past is where people
who escape from their duties live.

01:32:14.997 --> 01:32:18.297
Do not let your present moment
be captured by the past...

01:32:18.564 --> 01:32:21.597
...so that you will not regret it
in the future.

01:32:22.997 --> 01:32:25.931
Human is "Ibn-ul Vakt".

01:32:27.131 --> 01:32:30.797
That is, the child of the moment
he lives in.

01:32:30.997 --> 01:32:32.731
The moment is now.

01:32:40.597 --> 01:32:42.231
It may be a trap.

01:32:43.764 --> 01:32:45.731
I forgot to breath without a trap...

01:32:45.831 --> 01:32:49.064
...and  to take a step without
stepping on the swamp of betrayal.

01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:51.097
I have no choice other than
being cautious.

01:32:51.164 --> 01:32:52.197
Do not worry.

01:32:52.264 --> 01:32:54.897
Take as many as Alps with you
that is needed.

01:32:54.964 --> 01:32:57.197
I will only take Bamsi and Dogan.

01:32:57.264 --> 01:33:00.864
We are planning to set off
in the morning before the sunrise.

01:33:00.997 --> 01:33:02.997
They are observing every move of us.

01:33:03.097 --> 01:33:06.931
If I set off with an army,
they will take precautions.

01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:09.331
So, I will go with only my Alps.

01:33:09.564 --> 01:33:12.831
The fewer we are,
the more we have chance.

01:33:15.197 --> 01:33:16.931
Any news from Kurdoglu?

01:33:16.997 --> 01:33:19.764
Not yet, son.

01:33:21.297 --> 01:33:24.031
Does Halime know what is going on?

01:33:24.097 --> 01:33:25.864
Not yet.

01:33:25.964 --> 01:33:28.764
I will tell her, if you permit.

01:33:32.897 --> 01:33:36.731
-Ertugrul...
-Yes, father?

01:33:36.831 --> 01:33:40.664
I will relieve Kurdoglu
off his duties tomorrow.

01:33:42.131 --> 01:33:44.631
I will grant his duties to you.

01:33:45.897 --> 01:33:46.897
Father...

01:33:46.964 --> 01:33:50.164
Do not ever tell me
that you are "after the hunt".

01:33:56.897 --> 01:34:00.964
I will do my duty with my honor
at the risk of my life.

01:34:01.764 --> 01:34:03.064
Thank you, son.

01:34:20.531 --> 01:34:22.531
Sir...

01:34:22.697 --> 01:34:26.764
...it is easy to forget
when the guilt is small...

01:34:26.831 --> 01:34:32.864
...but to try to kill somebody
and ambush him is unforgettable.

01:34:46.064 --> 01:34:47.864
Listen, son...

01:34:48.997 --> 01:34:51.297
When our Prophet...

01:34:52.331 --> 01:34:56.997
...was given the duty
to call the humanity to serve God...

01:34:57.697 --> 01:35:02.597
...the Meccans reacted
very badly to his call.

01:35:04.197 --> 01:35:06.531
Our Prophet told them that...

01:35:07.231 --> 01:35:09.631
...God is one, he is the one
who created us all...

01:35:09.697 --> 01:35:11.964
...there is no god, only him...

01:35:12.031 --> 01:35:14.697
...and they were not supposed to
serve any other one...

01:35:14.764 --> 01:35:17.297
...but the Meccans saw him as an enemy.

01:35:18.631 --> 01:35:22.164
They were troubled by the fact that
their order was going to mess up.

01:35:22.231 --> 01:35:23.764
They made plans.

01:35:24.664 --> 01:35:26.897
They made tricks.

01:35:28.297 --> 01:35:31.997
Since they could not succeed
to make our Prophet give up...

01:35:32.997 --> 01:35:37.831
...they started to say "If only somebody
came up and saved us from Muhammad."

01:35:40.331 --> 01:35:42.164
And somebody came up.

01:35:42.864 --> 01:35:45.031
Omar Al-Khattab.

01:35:46.097 --> 01:35:50.231
A fearless, brave young man.

01:35:51.831 --> 01:35:53.831
He said "I will do it."

01:35:55.197 --> 01:35:57.964
"Not that he messes with your peace...

01:35:58.064 --> 01:36:00.164
...and breaks your unity...

01:36:00.264 --> 01:36:06.231
...it is my duty to kill him
and save Mecca from this trouble."

01:36:07.831 --> 01:36:10.731
The Meccans were so happy
after these words.

01:36:11.231 --> 01:36:15.197
They will get rid of the biggest trouble
without anybody got hurt.

01:36:15.631 --> 01:36:18.097
Omar girded on his sword...

01:36:19.664 --> 01:36:22.797
...and sets off to kill our Prophet.

01:36:24.531 --> 01:36:29.131
What he did not know was that
God creates everything with a reason.

01:36:30.164 --> 01:36:32.197
While everybody sets up traps...

01:36:33.064 --> 01:36:38.164
...God makes men's traps
a servant for his actual wish.

01:36:41.697 --> 01:36:44.231
Suleyman will gather up
a meeting tomorrow.

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:48.997
He is planning to relieve me off my duties
and pave the way for Ertugrul.

01:36:49.331 --> 01:36:53.164
And then he will go and
bring the Templars' castle down.

01:36:53.264 --> 01:36:57.864
I would not get surprised
if they had their eyes on Konstantiniyye.

01:36:58.264 --> 01:37:02.631
Now, the tents that we all know
will be surrounded in the morning.

01:37:03.664 --> 01:37:06.631
The beys who say anything
will be taken out of their tents.

01:37:06.764 --> 01:37:11.564
And last of all, you will go into the
marquee and take Hayme and Suleyman.

01:37:12.997 --> 01:37:15.031
Gundogdu is ill.

01:37:15.131 --> 01:37:17.331
He cannot cause any trouble.

01:37:17.564 --> 01:37:19.564
But Ertugrul?

01:37:19.631 --> 01:37:21.864
He will go with his Alps in the morning.

01:37:21.964 --> 01:37:23.031
I know that.

01:37:23.131 --> 01:37:27.197
I intentionally waited for him to go,
so that he will not cause any commotion.

01:37:27.297 --> 01:37:30.697
I want to finish this without any blood.

01:37:32.097 --> 01:37:35.564
After all, Suleyman
has been serving for us for so long.

01:37:35.631 --> 01:37:36.964
He was our bey.

01:37:37.031 --> 01:37:38.197
You are right, Bey.

01:37:38.264 --> 01:37:41.031
Completely right.
Of course, Kurdoglu.

01:37:41.097 --> 01:37:42.597
Thank you.

01:37:42.697 --> 01:37:46.531
The Alps that I trust
will surround the marquee in the morning.

01:37:46.631 --> 01:37:48.064
God help us.

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:52.897
What about the beys
that do not obey you?

01:37:53.230 --> 01:37:55.097
They will either obey...

01:37:56.631 --> 01:37:57.964
...or they will die.

01:38:00.297 --> 01:38:03.831
While Omar was on the way
to kill our Prophet...

01:38:03.931 --> 01:38:08.231
...he hears a sound
coming from his sister's house.

01:38:09.597 --> 01:38:12.597
His sister and his husband
have become Muslim.

01:38:13.131 --> 01:38:16.697
They were reading out verses
from the Holy Quran.

01:38:16.764 --> 01:38:18.097
Omar rushed in.

01:38:19.264 --> 01:38:22.297
He went mad with the scene he witnessed.

01:38:22.531 --> 01:38:25.597
He slapped his sister and his husband.

01:38:25.664 --> 01:38:27.731
He knocked them on the ground.

01:38:28.331 --> 01:38:32.197
His sister, who was a brave woman...

01:38:33.231 --> 01:38:36.264
...shouted the truth to Omar:

01:38:37.764 --> 01:38:41.897
"We will not renege on our religion
even if you kill us."

01:38:44.097 --> 01:38:50.064
Those words caused a spring come out of
his heart which was hard like a stone.

01:38:52.964 --> 01:38:58.031
God enlivens the heart of the man
who came to kill his prophet with Islam.

01:38:58.831 --> 01:39:02.097
He brings the living out of the dead.

01:39:02.164 --> 01:39:05.797
He gives life to a dead heart
with the water of faith.

01:39:05.864 --> 01:39:12.664
Omar becomes Muslim and says
the words of Islamic confession of faith.

01:39:14.964 --> 01:39:19.731
He takes the meaning of life
from the man he went there to kill.

01:39:20.197 --> 01:39:21.864
God works like this.

01:39:22.997 --> 01:39:27.197
He brings the living out of the dead
and the dead out of the living.

01:39:28.231 --> 01:39:31.764
Man should surrender to God
so much that...

01:39:31.864 --> 01:39:35.631
...the person who goes there to kill him
would find life.

01:39:36.531 --> 01:39:39.797
A Muslim should be
the reason of life for his killer.

01:39:41.031 --> 01:39:44.097
This is what surrendering to God means.

01:39:44.197 --> 01:39:48.897
Sir, I think
my situation is kind of similar.

01:39:51.064 --> 01:39:53.297
Yes, son.

01:39:53.564 --> 01:39:55.864
Your temperament is like Omar's.

01:39:57.697 --> 01:40:00.697
God Almighty made you the one
who found the water of life...

01:40:00.797 --> 01:40:03.164
...while you were going to kill.

01:40:04.997 --> 01:40:08.864
I hope everything about you
will be similar to Omar's.

01:40:08.997 --> 01:40:14.697
Let one of your names be Omar,
so that you will not forget this blessing.

01:40:36.531 --> 01:40:38.831
How is my brother doing?

01:40:38.897 --> 01:40:43.097
Thanks to you... he is alright.

01:40:49.864 --> 01:40:54.831
God bless both Halime and you.
You gave life to her.

01:40:56.864 --> 01:41:00.297
Do not worry.
Everything will be alright.

01:41:03.264 --> 01:41:06.664
I will make the ones
who did to my brother pay.

01:41:19.797 --> 01:41:21.997
Excuse me.

01:41:40.931 --> 01:41:42.998
May I come in, Halime Sultan?

01:41:43.864 --> 01:41:46.131
Come in, Ertugrul Bey.

01:41:54.298 --> 01:41:56.298
Yigit is in the castle.

01:41:58.364 --> 01:42:00.564
They will take him to Konstantiniyye.

01:42:10.131 --> 01:42:11.964
If you cannot take him...

01:42:13.231 --> 01:42:15.198
...kill him, Ertugrul Bey.

01:42:25.064 --> 01:42:29.398
Both Yigit and me
will be grateful if you do this.

01:42:33.831 --> 01:42:35.931
I know how to accept my fate.

01:42:38.398 --> 01:42:41.364
But dragging you after it...

01:42:42.064 --> 01:42:43.831
...renders me helpless.

01:42:44.598 --> 01:42:48.798
The day that gazelle brought me to you...

01:42:49.364 --> 01:42:52.964
...I understood that
my fate was not only for me.

01:42:55.498 --> 01:42:58.198
You should understand this, too.

01:42:58.264 --> 01:42:59.898
Our fate is one.

01:43:04.498 --> 01:43:06.198
May God speed you.

01:43:07.931 --> 01:43:09.964
May the Sun not burn your skin.

01:43:11.398 --> 01:43:13.964
May the rain not make your soul cold.

01:43:15.364 --> 01:43:17.798
May stones be away from your foot.

01:43:19.998 --> 01:43:24.131
Go like water,
and come back to your tent like water.

01:43:25.231 --> 01:43:27.531
May God protect you, Halime Sultan.

01:43:27.598 --> 01:43:29.798
You too, Ertugrul.

01:43:58.364 --> 01:43:59.998
May I come in?

01:44:00.998 --> 01:44:02.898
Come in, Gokce.

01:44:11.964 --> 01:44:15.098
I heard what happened
to the Shahzade, Halime.

01:44:15.198 --> 01:44:17.498
I hope you come together soon.

01:44:18.498 --> 01:44:20.198
Thank you, Gokce.

01:44:22.264 --> 01:44:24.598
As to Ertugrul and you...

01:44:25.964 --> 01:44:27.864
...you should know that...

01:44:27.964 --> 01:44:30.831
...I loved Ertugrul more than my own life.

01:44:31.798 --> 01:44:34.164
So much that I could forget him.

01:44:38.198 --> 01:44:41.931
And he loved you
so much that he could not see it.

01:44:43.898 --> 01:44:46.564
I hope you get married and be happy.

01:44:56.398 --> 01:45:00.998
However, never forget this, Halime...

01:45:03.998 --> 01:45:06.431
If you make Ertugrul unhappy...

01:45:06.564 --> 01:45:10.864
...I will make you pay in both worlds.

01:45:32.364 --> 01:45:34.098
May I come in, mother?

01:45:34.198 --> 01:45:36.331
Come in, son. Come in.

01:45:51.264 --> 01:45:54.598
We also talked like this...

01:45:54.898 --> 01:45:59.131
...when your father decided to send you
to Aleppo. Remember? On the stairs.

01:45:59.231 --> 01:46:00.531
I do, mother.

01:46:00.831 --> 01:46:02.964
Your words gave me courage.

01:46:04.231 --> 01:46:08.231
I could not have been as sharp as
the sword that Wild Demir makes...

01:46:08.298 --> 01:46:10.164
...if it were not your words.

01:46:10.298 --> 01:46:12.831
And maybe I would come back
without succeeding.

01:46:12.931 --> 01:46:14.264
But you did.

01:46:15.798 --> 01:46:19.898
Just like you could not turn your back
to that gazelle eyed girl's screams...

01:46:19.998 --> 01:46:23.798
...you did your duty that your father
gave you successfully.

01:46:24.898 --> 01:46:27.331
I could neither leave
my gazelle-eyed woman...

01:46:27.431 --> 01:46:31.098
...nor come back without doing
the duty that my father gave me.

01:46:31.198 --> 01:46:35.831
I've said "You could know neither
you would meet that gazelle...

01:46:36.231 --> 01:46:40.464
...nor you would throw the tent
into the fire along with yourself."

01:46:43.331 --> 01:46:46.298
Then, I said...

01:46:47.198 --> 01:46:52.298
..."There are fires
that burn and turn the meal into ashes.

01:46:53.231 --> 01:46:58.164
And there are fires
that cook the meal and feed you."

01:46:59.331 --> 01:47:02.264
It showed you where you fell down.

01:47:03.131 --> 01:47:07.898
Nobody has the right to rebel.
Neither you, nor the people of the tent.

01:47:08.564 --> 01:47:11.131
This is a test from God Almighty.

01:47:13.064 --> 01:47:18.531
You may either get cooked
and grow mature, or turn into ashes.

01:47:23.798 --> 01:47:27.831
That is why I told you
to stand by your father's decisions.

01:47:30.198 --> 01:47:33.098
You are right. You did, mother.

01:47:34.098 --> 01:47:38.131
Thankfully, I did not turn into ashes
in the fire I got in.

01:47:38.264 --> 01:47:43.498
And now, you must
stand by your father's decisions.

01:47:44.064 --> 01:47:47.364
You will take over
all of the duties that Kurdoglu had.

01:47:50.364 --> 01:47:52.597
You had three Alps before.

01:47:52.864 --> 01:47:56.498
But now, all the Alps of the tent
will be at your disposal.

01:47:59.498 --> 01:48:04.298
You will order them
not only to kill, but also to die.

01:48:07.864 --> 01:48:10.598
Just like it is Halime
who fits this tent...

01:48:12.131 --> 01:48:15.164
...you are the bey who fits here, son.

01:48:16.798 --> 01:48:21.798
Just like you could not run away
from your duty, and from that gazelle...

01:48:22.898 --> 01:48:27.031
...do not ever run away
from being the bey of the Kayis.

01:48:30.131 --> 01:48:32.964
Your father wants this wholeheartedly.

01:48:34.131 --> 01:48:36.164
But he does not tell.

01:48:38.831 --> 01:48:40.564
I just wanted you to know.

01:48:43.031 --> 01:48:44.498
Alright, go now.

01:48:44.598 --> 01:48:46.598
May God speed you, son.

01:48:49.331 --> 01:48:51.464
May God protect me from depraving, mother.

01:48:51.531 --> 01:48:53.531
Amen.

01:48:57.531 --> 01:48:59.564
May God protect you.

01:48:59.831 --> 01:49:01.298
Amen, mother.

01:50:29.164 --> 01:50:30.598
Gunkut is dealt with, Bey.

01:50:30.831 --> 01:50:32.598
Good. Start, then.

01:50:32.864 --> 01:50:34.464
Yes, Bey.

01:50:46.964 --> 01:50:50.031
<i>Hail to the horses running breathlessly</i>

01:50:51.598 --> 01:50:55.498
<i>Hail to the ones that</i>
 <i>Sparks come out of their horseshoes</i>

01:50:55.931 --> 01:51:00.264
<i>For our tent, for our Bey</i>
 <i>For our tradition</i>

01:51:00.431 --> 01:51:02.398
<i>If I get scared to die</i>

01:51:02.498 --> 01:51:06.864
<i>May my sword of black steel</i>
 <i>Saw me in the sky</i>

01:51:08.898 --> 01:51:12.931
<i>May the blue sky tear apart</i>
 <i>And the black earth stave in</i>

01:51:13.264 --> 01:51:16.431
<i>May my name be erased from monuments</i>

01:51:17.498 --> 01:51:20.198
<i>And may my father Oghuz, my holy tent</i>

01:51:20.331 --> 01:51:23.798
<i>Make me pay in the other world</i>

01:51:24.431 --> 01:51:26.498
<i>May God be my helper</i>

01:51:26.598 --> 01:51:30.898
<i>And my ancestor Hizir my companion</i>
 <i>In this path of holy war</i>

01:52:05.164 --> 01:52:07.564
God, let Ertugrul be successful.

01:52:09.031 --> 01:52:11.298
Do not leave him alone.

01:52:13.798 --> 01:52:15.864
Grant strength to my brother.

01:52:23.798 --> 01:52:27.464
Halime Sultan, you are under arrest
by the order of our Bey.

01:52:30.864 --> 01:52:32.198
What are you talking about?

01:52:32.298 --> 01:52:34.098
Suleyman Shah would never do such a thing.

01:52:34.198 --> 01:52:37.831
Our bey is not Suleyman Shah anymore.
It is Kurdoglu.

01:53:49.798 --> 01:53:55.098
Do not even think about it, Suleyman Shah.
Let us do this without any blood spilled.

01:53:57.064 --> 01:54:02.064
So, my Alps whom I loved like my own sons
revolted against their fathers!

01:54:02.164 --> 01:54:05.264
We only follow orders, Bey.

01:54:06.798 --> 01:54:09.064
Was this order given by Kurdoglu to you?

01:54:09.164 --> 01:54:11.364
Our bey is Kurdoglu from now on.

01:54:20.898 --> 01:54:22.864
Let us change our clothes.

01:54:23.364 --> 01:54:25.264
Get out.

01:55:36.364 --> 01:55:37.898
Father!

01:55:43.364 --> 01:55:47.198
Let him go! Traitors, let him go!

01:55:47.298 --> 01:55:48.564
Bastards!

01:55:48.798 --> 01:55:50.364
Let him go!

01:56:01.998 --> 01:56:03.298
Father!

01:56:04.464 --> 01:56:07.964
Move! Father!

01:56:11.231 --> 01:56:12.964
Father!

01:56:14.098 --> 01:56:15.598
Father!

01:56:16.064 --> 01:56:18.931
-Father!
-Aykiz!

01:56:18.998 --> 01:56:20.831
Traitors! Father!

01:56:21.531 --> 01:56:24.531
Rascals! Bastards!

01:56:25.164 --> 01:56:27.098
Father!

01:56:38.498 --> 01:56:41.564
Did that low-down Kurdoglu send you?

01:56:41.864 --> 01:56:44.897
Selcan Hatun, do not talk ill
about our Bey...

01:56:44.998 --> 01:56:48.131
...if you want to be treated
like you deserve.

01:56:48.198 --> 01:56:50.331
You can all go to hell!

01:56:50.864 --> 01:56:52.464
But me, first.

01:56:56.031 --> 01:56:57.798
I do not want to leave my bey alone.

01:56:57.864 --> 01:56:59.564
The midwives will take care of him.

01:56:59.798 --> 01:57:02.498
Kurdoglu gave orders. Let us go.

01:58:20.464 --> 01:58:22.898
You never listened to me, Suleyman.

01:58:23.398 --> 01:58:26.264
Since you sent Ertugrul to Aleppo...

01:58:26.931 --> 01:58:31.898
...and you accepted that ominous shahzade
and his children to the tent...

01:58:32.498 --> 01:58:34.564
...our unity has been broken.

01:58:34.831 --> 01:58:36.931
And now, you will pay the price.

01:58:37.464 --> 01:58:41.831
The price you say I will be paying
is nothing but my pride.

01:58:42.931 --> 01:58:45.264
One who becomes a bey with tricks...

01:58:45.364 --> 01:58:49.131
...and goes against the traditions
is no good to anybody.

01:58:49.464 --> 01:58:54.364
How dare you will be on the seat of our
ancestors who left Otugen and came here?

01:58:54.464 --> 01:58:57.031
This marquee will be your damnation.

01:58:58.131 --> 01:59:01.298
You will see that
you cannot be a leader with persecutions.

01:59:01.398 --> 01:59:04.331
Now, beware of God's wrath.

01:59:04.964 --> 01:59:07.064
Nobody can escape his damnation.

01:59:13.831 --> 01:59:18.398
We know who you are and who you serve for.

01:59:20.031 --> 01:59:24.464
And now, the whole world
will know it, Kurdoglu.

01:59:46.298 --> 01:59:47.898
Let Suleyman Shah go!

01:59:50.431 --> 01:59:52.331
Our bey is Suleyman Shah!

02:00:04.464 --> 02:00:06.231
Let Suleyman Shah go!

02:00:11.198 --> 02:00:14.031
Our Bey is Suleyman Shah!

02:00:15.198 --> 02:00:17.164
Kurdoglu is not our bey!

02:00:22.431 --> 02:00:23.964
Let Suleyman Shah go!

02:00:24.031 --> 02:00:25.964
Kurdoglu, you are a traitor!

02:00:33.464 --> 02:00:35.231
Long live Kurdoglu!

02:00:47.464 --> 02:00:53.364
From now on,
Kurdoglu is the bey of the Kayi Tent!

02:01:00.331 --> 02:01:02.431
If anybody has anything to say...

02:01:02.564 --> 02:01:06.398
...he should say now,
if he has the courage!

02:01:38.198 --> 02:01:40.431
Son!

02:01:40.531 --> 02:01:42.164
Kurdoglu!

02:01:43.431 --> 02:01:46.164
You betrayed to your blood brother.

02:01:50.131 --> 02:01:56.464
You betrayed to the tradition and
the decision that the marquee has given.

02:02:00.164 --> 02:02:04.998
If you have the least courage,
come and face me.

02:02:09.198 --> 02:02:11.998
You were the hope of this tent.

02:02:13.598 --> 02:02:15.231
You were clever.

02:02:15.298 --> 02:02:16.931
You were brave.

02:02:17.031 --> 02:02:19.364
I granted you a big opportunity.

02:02:19.464 --> 02:02:21.064
But what did you do?

02:02:21.564 --> 02:02:24.231
You sat on your father's tail.

02:02:24.331 --> 02:02:29.164
You destroyed both your future
and the tent's for this old man.

02:02:30.531 --> 02:02:32.798
You are a coward, Gundogdu!

02:02:33.898 --> 02:02:35.998
And I have nothing to do with cowards.

02:02:36.098 --> 02:02:37.831
Take them away!

02:03:09.298 --> 02:03:10.998
Enough!

02:03:11.264 --> 02:03:12.898
Enough!

02:03:12.998 --> 02:03:14.898
Stop it now!

02:03:17.931 --> 02:03:20.198
I do not want any blood spilled.

02:03:31.398 --> 02:03:33.964
Everybody go back to their tents!

02:03:34.064 --> 02:03:37.431
What is necessary will be done
in the meeting.

02:03:47.864 --> 02:03:52.798
If you lay a hand on my sons,
I swear I will kill you, Kurdoglu.

02:03:53.164 --> 02:03:54.931
Do not worry, Suleyman.

02:03:55.498 --> 02:03:58.998
The decision about you
will be given in the meeting.

02:03:59.098 --> 02:04:02.798
I am responsible for both Dundar
and Gundogdu's lives until then.

02:04:02.864 --> 02:04:05.364
Like all the rest of your family.

02:04:06.898 --> 02:04:08.231
Now, take him.

02:04:15.998 --> 02:04:17.431
Let Suleyman Shah go!

02:04:17.531 --> 02:04:19.331
Kurdoglu, you are a traitor!

02:04:23.198 --> 02:04:25.264
Traitors!

02:04:29.298 --> 02:04:30.598
You are a traitor!

02:05:31.331 --> 02:05:33.198
We are going to camp here.

02:06:11.231 --> 02:06:13.464
Get out of the way, you infidels!

02:07:14.264 --> 02:07:16.331
So we meet again, Black Priest.

02:09:36.364 --> 02:09:40.331
So, Kurdoglu's intention is
to make our son kill us.

02:10:19.498 --> 02:10:21.431
Please forgive me, sir.
I am begging you.

02:10:21.498 --> 02:10:23.464
I am an ordinary farmer, sir.

02:10:23.598 --> 02:10:26.598
They brought me and my son
here by force, sir.

02:10:52.331 --> 02:10:53.998
It is over, Turk!

02:10:56.031 --> 02:10:58.198
You are at the end of the road.

02:11:02.031 --> 02:11:03.098
Who are you?

02:11:03.598 --> 02:11:07.064
Grandmaster Petruchio Manzini.

02:11:09.931 --> 02:11:12.064
I am Isadora's uncle.

02:11:14.998 --> 02:11:16.598
It is over, Ertugrul.

02:11:20.831 --> 02:11:26.964
You played dangerous games
a goat shepherd should not.

02:11:28.131 --> 02:11:29.864
You lost!

02:11:30.398 --> 02:11:32.998
And you will pay the price.

02:11:35.598 --> 02:11:37.498
Surrender immediately.

02:11:39.331 --> 02:11:41.798
I will not warn you again.

02:11:41.898 --> 02:11:45.031
It is impossible for you to defeat us.

02:11:48.098 --> 02:11:50.464
Do you understand me, Turk?

02:11:54.298 --> 02:11:56.031
What do we do now, Bey?

02:11:57.364 --> 02:12:00.364
We will smash them
like Wild Demir's hammer.

02:12:04.064 --> 02:12:06.364
No stopping, no hesitating.

02:12:07.298 --> 02:12:08.798
Understood, Bey.

02:12:09.331 --> 02:12:12.298
Hey, Bamsi...
You definitely know how to fight.

02:12:13.564 --> 02:12:14.964
Bey...

02:12:15.031 --> 02:12:17.831
Like when you forged sword
with Wild Demir, right?

02:12:17.898 --> 02:12:19.564
Oh, yes.

02:12:20.398 --> 02:12:23.198
-God is Hayy.
-God is Hakk.

02:12:23.298 --> 02:12:25.131
Ertugrul, surrender.

02:12:25.231 --> 02:12:26.798
It is over!

02:12:27.131 --> 02:12:29.898
-God is Hayy!
-God is Hakk!
