12:12.870 --> 12:15.870
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:17.414 --> 12:20.414
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:21.681 --> 12:24.681
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:25.349 --> 12:26.615
Long live Suleyman Shah!

12:26.949 --> 12:28.582
Long live Suleyman Shah!

12:29.249 --> 12:30.582
Long live Suleyman Shah!

12:30.982 --> 12:32.515
Long live Suleyman Shah!

12:33.015 --> 12:34.449
Long live Suleyman Shah!

12:34.982 --> 12:36.549
Long live Suleyman Shah!

12:37.049 --> 12:38.615
Long live Suleyman Shah!

12:39.249 --> 12:40.582
Long live Suleyman Shah!

12:41.249 --> 12:42.582
Long live Suleyman Shah!

12:51.640 --> 12:54.007
May God bless you in both His realms!

12:54.407 --> 12:55.474
Amen!

12:56.474 --> 12:59.674
You blessed me with a holy conquest
at this age.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.074
May God preserve you for us, Bey!

13:02.474 --> 13:03.540
Amen!

13:05.607 --> 13:09.674
Let us collect our dead at once,
and tear the castle apart.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.740
What happened to Titus the heathen?

13:13.174 --> 13:14.740
He escaped towards the castle, brother.

13:17.674 --> 13:21.140
My Bey, I desire to send Yigit Alp
back to our tribe, if you permit.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.807
His sister would be in deep concern.
-Send him right away.

13:24.774 --> 13:26.607
So that the glad news
shall reach our tribe.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.174
Great God!

15:13.074 --> 15:14.074
Stop!

15:20.907 --> 15:24.174
Bey, our Alps cornered
the head of Templars

15:24.874 --> 15:26.040
while they were trying to escape.

15:26.607 --> 15:29.740
They locked themselves in. We are
trying to break the door and enter.

15:30.107 --> 15:32.440
-How many are there?
-Nine or ten, Bey.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.607
They did not surrender
even if we had insisted.

15:37.674 --> 15:38.674
Bey.

15:42.374 --> 15:43.574
Please let me, brother.

15:45.974 --> 15:47.374
Come, Turgut brother.

15:49.474 --> 15:50.574
Come on, brother.

15:50.807 --> 15:51.907
-Come on.
-Come on.

15:53.774 --> 15:54.774
Come on.

16:06.940 --> 16:07.974
Come on, brother.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.840
-Give me a hand, brother.
-We will open it, brother.

16:26.574 --> 16:27.807
With God's help we will open it.

16:29.140 --> 16:30.707
-Come on, brother.
-Come on.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.474
Come on.

16:36.174 --> 16:37.407
With the name of God!

16:42.002 --> 16:43.702
Hamza!

18:43.736 --> 18:46.402
Mercy! Mercy!

18:48.336 --> 18:50.502
I do not know why,
but he reminds me of Kurtoglu.

18:51.736 --> 18:54.036
These people do
every kind of wretchedness.

18:54.569 --> 18:57.136
And ask for mercy when they understand
that they will not get off.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.969
Take these rascals.

18:59.536 --> 19:01.169
I will punish them at the yard.

19:08.136 --> 19:11.569
All of this wickedness comes from your
small minds, eh?

19:47.336 --> 19:49.236
This is where it ends, you devil.

19:49.702 --> 19:53.569
I will give you hell in your own temple.

20:09.936 --> 20:11.536
<i>Take him to the dungeon.</i>

20:11.736 --> 20:14.036
<i>I will handle him myself.</i>

20:14.102 --> 20:16.602
<i>Cowards! Kill me if you will!</i>

20:17.002 --> 20:20.069
<i>It will not be as easy like that Turkmen.</i>

20:20.302 --> 20:21.569
<i>You will beg for it.</i>

21:13.302 --> 21:15.702
My God, bless you.

21:17.336 --> 21:20.502
You allowed me to see this blessed day.

21:21.436 --> 21:26.402
Although as Suleyman Shah said,
I was not able to become a martyr.

21:26.469 --> 21:31.402
But I saw Ertugrul Bey planting our flag
to these bastions.

21:31.469 --> 21:34.569
His sword in one hand,
our flag in the other.

21:34.969 --> 21:37.702
Screaming the name of our God.

21:39.969 --> 21:41.102
My God

21:41.602 --> 21:48.536
you allowed me to go to battle with
my Suleyman Shah and his two brave sons.

21:48.969 --> 21:50.569
Blessed be God.

21:55.502 --> 21:57.469
Sit down Wild Veteran, sit down.

21:57.936 --> 21:59.069
You are wounded.

21:59.136 --> 22:02.936
Bey, my wounds are my medal of honor.

22:03.469 --> 22:06.369
They made me a veteran in the eyes of God

22:06.936 --> 22:11.336
and proud, in the presence of your
brave sons.

22:21.702 --> 22:23.736
As long as we have Alps like

22:24.402 --> 22:31.369
Wild Veteran and the likes of you
who considered being a martyr

22:32.002 --> 22:36.136
is the ultimate way to earn
God's blessing,

22:36.202 --> 22:40.636
the enemies of Islam will never
stand a chance against us.

22:40.702 --> 22:42.169
God willing, Bey.

22:43.735 --> 22:46.002
On this day, you have honored me.

22:47.302 --> 22:48.436
And not just me.

22:49.269 --> 22:55.002
You who carry the noble
blood of Oghuz Khan,

22:55.569 --> 22:59.436
did not let the sacred
flag of Kayi to fall.

23:01.336 --> 23:03.136
Our flag flies in the sky!

23:03.702 --> 23:05.436
May God bless you all.

23:05.502 --> 23:12.369
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

23:22.302 --> 23:26.136
Tatos Harput, animal trader, is it?

23:29.069 --> 23:31.469
He is nothing but a trader of evil.

23:33.436 --> 23:36.169
This rascal is responsible for every

23:36.236 --> 23:39.402
calamity from Antioch to Aleppo and
Damascus to Konya.

23:44.136 --> 23:45.302
The great devil!

23:46.669 --> 23:48.969
No fire can can harm the sons of Ibrahim.

23:50.369 --> 23:52.602
No well can devour Josephs.

23:54.202 --> 23:57.169
And the pharaohs cannot rule over Moses.

24:01.336 --> 24:03.536
Do you know who poisoned you?

24:05.036 --> 24:07.669
Black Priest, Thomas.

24:09.602 --> 24:11.202
Are you surprised?

24:12.502 --> 24:15.636
He was the one who gave Isadora
the poisoned dagger.

24:17.369 --> 24:19.969
And we have the Black Priest right now.

24:22.202 --> 24:25.702
You will be gathered
on the Day of Resurrection,

24:26.236 --> 24:32.536
as blind, dumb and deaf men.
Your faces will be buried in the ground.

24:33.369 --> 24:35.102
Your path will lead you to hell.

24:35.602 --> 24:41.936
It's fire will be rekindled,
whenever it starts to fade away.

24:42.502 --> 24:44.969
You will not escape the torments of hell.

24:50.669 --> 24:52.002
Move!

25:44.969 --> 25:48.502
I will not die
until I take a life from you.

26:41.669 --> 26:43.369
Do I have your permission, Bey?

26:45.302 --> 26:47.336
This is your day, Turgut.

26:48.102 --> 26:51.169
Revenge is halal to you
like your mother's milk.

27:44.702 --> 27:46.169
Bey!

27:51.102 --> 27:52.236
Bey!

27:52.569 --> 27:54.402
We captured the castle completely.

27:54.969 --> 27:58.969
Good, prepare the bodies of our martyrs.

27:59.236 --> 28:01.202
We will bury them at the nomad group.

28:01.636 --> 28:04.036
Gather the corpses of heathens
in the dungeon.

28:04.402 --> 28:05.702
As you command.

28:06.569 --> 28:09.636
We will raze the castle on them
as their gravestones.

28:14.636 --> 28:18.236
Ertugrul, handle them as well.

28:19.636 --> 28:20.736
As you command, Bey.

28:21.236 --> 28:24.036
Hamza, handle them.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.602
As you command, Bey.

28:29.202 --> 28:30.569
What about Titus?

28:31.336 --> 28:33.702
It's Like the ground has
swallowed that wretch.

28:38.102 --> 28:39.269
Titus!

28:40.502 --> 28:41.669
He couldn' have escaped.

28:42.336 --> 28:44.436
He must be hiding somewhere in the castle.

28:45.969 --> 28:47.269
We will search every hole.

28:47.669 --> 28:48.969
As you command, Bey.

28:49.036 --> 28:50.369
As you command, Bey.

29:27.536 --> 29:29.169
Mix this.

29:29.236 --> 29:31.436
Sit down, I will handle this.

29:52.102 --> 29:53.602
Are there any news?

29:54.502 --> 29:56.269
No, Gokce Hatun.

29:57.536 --> 30:00.102
If God permits,
we will hear the good news soon.

30:03.736 --> 30:08.669
I can almost see my Turgut
returning to me with his horse.

30:16.669 --> 30:21.202
Now I understand what it means
to be the wife of an Alp who goes to war.

30:22.969 --> 30:25.702
You always said how hard it was
to be the a wife of an Alp.

30:26.936 --> 30:31.169
Our brave husbands carry our hearts
with their swords.

30:31.602 --> 30:33.036
You are right.

30:36.602 --> 30:41.536
As long as our brave warriors are alive,
they will not let tyrants rule the world.

30:54.336 --> 30:55.636
Messengers are here.

30:55.702 --> 30:57.536
God willing.

30:57.602 --> 31:00.069
God, let it be good news!

31:16.402 --> 31:18.069
Yigit, Yigit!

31:29.002 --> 31:31.302
Yigit. Thank God.

31:35.536 --> 31:36.969
Welcome.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.102
Gundogdu Bey saved me.

31:42.302 --> 31:45.269
It was a huge battle.
We won in the end.

31:45.736 --> 31:47.702
The castle of Templars
was burned to the ground.

31:47.969 --> 31:49.436
Oh, thank God!

31:52.569 --> 31:56.702
Mother Hayme, I bring the prayers
and good will of Suleyman Shah.

31:57.302 --> 31:59.236
The castle of infidels has been captured.

32:00.236 --> 32:03.636
Those who brought trouble to our
nomad group have perished one by one.

32:04.069 --> 32:06.502
Thank God, bless you.

32:09.669 --> 32:14.369
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

32:16.736 --> 32:21.069
Let us make sacrifices,
and prepare for our brave ones, sisters.

32:21.469 --> 32:22.636
Okay, mother.

32:23.936 --> 32:26.702
However, we have many wounded and martyrs.

32:28.069 --> 32:29.669
Bey wanted you to make preperations

32:30.036 --> 32:32.502
for the wounded they are bringing
with them.

32:33.736 --> 32:35.936
Suleyman Shah need not worry.

32:36.436 --> 32:38.669
We will prepare everything.

32:39.736 --> 32:43.569
Both my husband and my father are
there, Alp. Are they okay?

32:44.136 --> 32:46.002
They are both fine, Aykiz.

32:46.569 --> 32:47.936
You should have see your father.

32:48.302 --> 32:50.036
He was the first to charge
and open the gates.

32:51.236 --> 32:53.969
Ertugrul Bey climbed to the walls
and planted our flag.

32:54.169 --> 32:55.936
Do not worry.

32:57.002 --> 32:58.602
My lion!

33:03.736 --> 33:05.202
What about my Alp?

33:05.502 --> 33:08.069
Are there any news of Konur Alp,
my brave?

33:08.702 --> 33:11.236
Are there any news of Guney Alp,
my brave?

33:15.569 --> 33:18.169
Mothers, sisters!

33:19.702 --> 33:22.536
Both ghazis and martyrs are ours.

33:24.302 --> 33:28.269
The martyrs who fell in the battle are
all of our brothers.

33:30.436 --> 33:32.602
Do not cry.

33:33.502 --> 33:36.136
Do not hurt the souls of our martyrs.

33:37.469 --> 33:40.669
They were blessed with the
highest of blessings.

33:41.502 --> 33:44.602
Kayi women stands strong.

33:44.702 --> 33:47.636
Let us start our preparations together.

33:48.536 --> 33:50.336
Come on.

34:29.269 --> 34:31.669
Where is this son of a swine?

34:33.002 --> 34:34.636
He is somewhere around here, brother.

34:35.236 --> 34:39.369
I know he wants to save his skin.

34:50.302 --> 34:53.602
Bey, they are not talking, either.

34:56.102 --> 35:00.936
Speak or I will beat you to a pulp,
you pig shit!

35:01.669 --> 35:03.269
Okay, Bamsi Beyrek.

35:04.469 --> 35:07.236
Apparently he is hiding somewhere
that nobody knows.

35:08.236 --> 35:10.236
He will leave his hole sooner or later.

35:13.136 --> 35:14.636
I am going to look for him, brother.

35:15.169 --> 35:18.302
It is forbidden for me to live
as long as he breathes.

35:24.036 --> 35:25.302
You are right.

35:26.269 --> 35:30.602
I will not die until
I kill the last one of you, Turk!

35:59.936 --> 36:05.269
According to these documents,
they made everything to convince Pope

36:05.502 --> 36:10.069
and Emperor Frederic to start
a new crusade.

36:10.336 --> 36:16.102
They assassinated many to provoke
Muslims to fight among themselves.

36:17.202 --> 36:23.069
They bought hundreds of people
in the army and state.

36:24.502 --> 36:26.936
But it doesn't end there.

36:27.236 --> 36:31.236
They did every kind of cruelty to
the Orthodox Christians, whom they hate.

36:32.369 --> 36:34.669
I heard crusaders shed the blood of
innocents

36:36.436 --> 36:39.502
when they conquered Constantinople.

36:41.202 --> 36:44.702
They pillaged many cities,
including Constantinople.

36:45.336 --> 36:47.202
They still continue their vile acts.

36:48.602 --> 36:52.469
They do not hesitate to massacre
even their Christian brethren.

36:53.169 --> 36:56.202
They kill their own brothers just because
they are from a different church.

36:56.669 --> 36:59.569
You have to take these letters
to Sultan Aleaddin, Afsin Bey.

37:01.202 --> 37:03.269
I will take them, but

37:03.569 --> 37:08.536
some of the names I have seen in these
lists have shocked me.

37:10.036 --> 37:12.702
With your permission,
I want to keep reading.

37:13.102 --> 37:15.302
You will inform us later on, Afsin.

37:31.469 --> 37:34.436
Oh, wow!

37:48.402 --> 37:49.669
Wretches!

37:50.136 --> 37:52.636
Who knows, whose claims are these.

37:54.302 --> 38:01.136
They tried to buy our nomad group and
the traitors to Islam with this gold.

38:02.536 --> 38:04.536
What about these gold, brother?

38:05.669 --> 38:07.502
Whatever Bey says.

38:10.436 --> 38:12.536
He will make the right decision.

38:43.502 --> 38:45.169
<i>Haven't you found him already?</i>

38:45.736 --> 38:47.402
<i>Search everywhere.</i>

39:42.969 --> 39:44.169
Gundogdu

39:45.636 --> 39:49.402
distribute some of our spoils
to the families of our martyrs.

39:50.302 --> 39:55.202
And some to the Christian villages at
the neighborhood. Compensate their losses.

39:55.636 --> 40:01.169
They have been under heavy taxes for
years. Let them breathe a little.

40:01.736 --> 40:06.036
And you shall distribute the rest of it
equally among our tribe.

40:07.236 --> 40:08.502
As you command, Bey.

40:09.502 --> 40:11.202
Any news from Titus?

40:12.236 --> 40:13.369
No, Bey.

40:17.936 --> 40:18.936
Keep searching.

40:19.536 --> 40:21.102
We have to find him.

40:22.036 --> 40:23.469
As you command, Bey.

40:41.936 --> 40:43.636
It is my turn to die, huh?

40:44.036 --> 40:46.969
On the contrary, you will not die.

40:47.369 --> 40:48.936
You will live.

40:50.269 --> 40:53.969
So that, the Papacy will know

40:54.269 --> 40:55.602
about the deeds of a bunch of Turks.

40:56.569 --> 41:00.702
Although, I highly doubt that
you will have the courage

41:01.136 --> 41:04.702
to go to Constantinople or Rome
after the letter of Afsin Bey.

41:10.502 --> 41:12.436
I think he has the courage, brother.

41:14.602 --> 41:18.702
Papacy must waiting the victories of Turks
impatiently.

41:20.369 --> 41:21.602
Stop idling and go.

41:27.369 --> 41:29.036
Your horse is ready outside.

41:29.302 --> 41:30.669
Keep your eyes open on the road.

41:31.102 --> 41:35.136
If the villagers see you, they will
tear you up before you reach Antioch.

41:37.636 --> 41:39.069
Ertugrul

41:39.536 --> 41:44.069
can you tell me what is in the chest of
Ibnul Arabi?

41:47.369 --> 41:51.402
A gift that will honor it's owner,
he says. That is all.

41:53.602 --> 41:56.469
For some reason,
I am not curious about it's owner.

42:01.302 --> 42:02.969
This is just the beginning.

42:04.636 --> 42:08.302
This conflict will not end,
even after a thousand years.

42:09.369 --> 42:10.669
It's true.

42:10.936 --> 42:14.969
Our blood will never stop chasing you
even after a thousand years.

42:15.536 --> 42:18.169
You will not sleep at peace.

42:18.669 --> 42:21.602
You will most certainly pay for
what you have done.

42:58.336 --> 43:00.169
Since when do you feel nauseous?

43:01.636 --> 43:03.302
It just started.

43:04.436 --> 43:07.936
But I could not say a word to anybody
after all this trouble.

43:13.136 --> 43:14.669
Selcan Hatun

43:17.236 --> 43:18.736
I swear you are pregnant.

43:20.069 --> 43:22.202
Finally, you will have a child.

43:25.736 --> 43:28.069
My fear are true.

43:29.169 --> 43:30.702
What am I going to do now?

43:32.002 --> 43:34.269
Will they believe me now?

43:42.302 --> 43:45.469
Your father is dead, brother.
May he rest in peace.

43:46.436 --> 43:48.102
Thank you, brother Dundar.

43:48.336 --> 43:51.136
I hope that you will take your
revenge with your own hands one day.

43:52.269 --> 43:55.169
I vow to take my revenge one day.

44:00.169 --> 44:03.469
You spoiled the plans of the Templars
and saved the nomad group.

44:03.936 --> 44:06.936
Praise to God. We stopped the heathens.

44:12.269 --> 44:14.202
Let's take a stroll of the nomad group.

44:16.536 --> 44:18.736
Mother, we are going out with Yigit.

44:19.102 --> 44:20.169
Okay.

44:29.636 --> 44:34.269
You can tell what kind of a man
these two will become. Just look at them.

44:34.336 --> 44:36.269
Their blood is wild.

44:36.469 --> 44:39.002
They want to conquer the world.

44:39.569 --> 44:40.736
They do mother.

44:41.569 --> 44:43.502
Yigit gets restless with each day.

44:44.236 --> 44:47.269
Ertugrul became a man at their age.

44:47.602 --> 44:49.469
He never got off of his mare.

44:50.969 --> 44:54.502
He brought many opponents
to their knees in wrestling.

44:55.036 --> 44:56.469
He was bouncing off the walls.

44:57.569 --> 45:02.702
But God knows, he never hurt us.
He never broke our hearts.

45:03.436 --> 45:06.402
We knew he was different when he was born.

45:06.469 --> 45:10.102
God Bless, mother.
You raised up a very beautiful son.

45:14.169 --> 45:19.569
Look, daughter.
A man is like a wild stallion.

45:20.369 --> 45:23.369
It is his wildness,
that keeps his marquee alive.

45:24.302 --> 45:29.969
If you want to have peace in your marquee,
you shall not try possess him.

45:30.702 --> 45:32.702
Because he does not like to be possessed.

45:33.602 --> 45:39.036
Of course you will feed and tame him

45:39.602 --> 45:41.436
like a hostler.

45:42.469 --> 45:44.702
You will serve him willingly.

45:45.469 --> 45:49.002
Then, that stallion will be loyal to you.

45:50.669 --> 45:55.469
If you do not do what I say,
he will be the first one to kick you.

45:56.936 --> 45:58.569
A valuable lesson for me, mother.

46:01.502 --> 46:07.069
Suleyman Shah may want to marry you to
Ertugrul right after they are back.

46:08.169 --> 46:13.402
So let us start to set up your own tent
right after tomorrow. Okay?

46:13.936 --> 46:16.436
Okay mother.
Whatever you deem appropriate.

48:21.702 --> 48:23.169
Farewell, Kayis.

48:23.569 --> 48:25.302
I will see you one more time.

48:40.669 --> 48:41.936
These heathens

48:42.602 --> 48:49.569
have made plans for the downfall of the
Islamic world on this table.

48:52.469 --> 48:56.469
<i>If we succeed, all of the borders of this</i>
 <i>realm will change.</i>

48:56.536 --> 49:01.569
<i>It is not going to be hard for us when</i>
 <i>Muslims are fighting each other, Titus.</i>

49:02.036 --> 49:07.236
<i>We will reach our goal the day we incite</i>
 <i>Turks against the descendants of</i>

49:08.002 --> 49:09.536
<i>Saladin Eyyubi.</i>

49:10.202 --> 49:11.936
<i>Jerusalem will be ours.</i>

49:12.536 --> 49:18.702
With God's will, we spoiled their plans
and razed their castle.

49:19.336 --> 49:20.436
Praise to God.

49:21.136 --> 49:23.302
Now it our turn to make plans.

49:28.369 --> 49:30.369
Oh, the great Otugen!

49:31.069 --> 49:32.936
I missed you a lot

49:33.969 --> 49:35.702
with your grand mountains

49:36.502 --> 49:40.169
cool tablelands and wild rivers.

49:41.336 --> 49:45.302
If God permits, we will return to the
land of our ancestors one day, father.

49:46.502 --> 49:47.669
Son

49:48.536 --> 49:52.969
it was our duty to ride through west
as the descendants of Oghuz.

49:54.002 --> 49:58.136
Our target will always be the lands
where the sun sets.

49:59.136 --> 50:05.169
After the Dandanakan victory,
Tugrul Bey has gathered a big council

50:07.302 --> 50:12.169
and decided the fate of Oghuz tribe.

50:13.136 --> 50:17.036
Our destiny lies in the lands
where the sun sets.

50:30.202 --> 50:31.436
Bey.

50:32.169 --> 50:34.569
Heathen Titus has eluded our Alps
and escaped.

51:15.736 --> 51:17.502
He has escaped.

51:27.969 --> 51:29.969
Catching him after this will be very hard.

51:30.369 --> 51:32.702
Until he confronts us.

52:01.936 --> 52:04.136
The sheep dog has escaped, huh?

52:04.702 --> 52:08.369
He martyred two of our Alps on his escape.

52:11.369 --> 52:14.936
We have seen that it is possible to
defeat these jackals.

52:16.469 --> 52:21.469
The power of our faith and
sword is enough for us.

52:22.569 --> 52:23.936
However

52:24.236 --> 52:26.636
their attacks will never end.

52:29.036 --> 52:33.369
They need to be confronted by a state
for that to happen, father.

52:35.036 --> 52:36.469
You are right, son.

52:37.202 --> 52:40.169
First, we have to become a state.

52:42.236 --> 52:44.236
Ayyubis are torn apart.

52:45.136 --> 52:48.236
Seljukian shahzadas are fighting
among themselves.

52:48.302 --> 52:50.202
World of Islam is leaderless.

52:51.202 --> 52:53.969
First, we have to establish
a powerful Seigniory.

52:56.469 --> 53:01.536
Brother, father.
Do you hear yourselves?

53:03.369 --> 53:05.169
We hear very well, son.

53:06.602 --> 53:08.402
Ertugrul is right.

53:09.202 --> 53:12.102
Establishing a Seigniory should be
our nomad group's priority.

53:12.702 --> 53:14.502
Elaziz is our friend.

53:15.069 --> 53:20.969
However, no emperor, no Bey would
let another Seigniory to be established

53:21.036 --> 53:22.536
in his realm.

53:23.469 --> 53:29.102
If founding a Seigniory is our destiny,
the land will find us, son.

53:32.002 --> 53:33.636
My time has passed.

53:34.669 --> 53:39.702
You will be the ones to strive for
this opportunity.

53:41.102 --> 53:43.736
The future of our nomad group is
in your hands.

53:47.369 --> 53:48.702
My sons...

53:50.369 --> 53:54.702
...If anything happens to me,
never abandon each other.

53:57.136 --> 53:59.936
Stay together all the time.

54:00.536 --> 54:02.102
If you stick together,

54:03.369 --> 54:07.136
our people will grow
and find a land of their own.

54:11.036 --> 54:12.569
Thank you father.

54:13.502 --> 54:14.569
Father!

54:20.102 --> 54:22.169
I will rest for a while.

54:22.936 --> 54:24.469
You should rest, too.

54:25.402 --> 54:29.536
We will take the road after
I perform my two rakat prayer tomorrow.

54:30.669 --> 54:32.236
God willing.

54:49.169 --> 54:51.002
How bad is his pustule?

54:52.269 --> 54:55.002
Very bad, brother. Very bad.

54:57.636 --> 54:59.269
It covers all of his back.

55:00.636 --> 55:04.269
We should talk to Arabi,
when we get back to our nomad tent.

55:04.502 --> 55:06.102
He will take care of it.

55:08.036 --> 55:10.669
What kind of an illness is this?
It hasn't healed.

55:21.936 --> 55:26.736
The Beys of Oghuz Tribes will gather.
Do white beards know about this?

55:27.969 --> 55:30.969
Nothing happens without their
knowledge, Ertugrul Bey.

55:31.536 --> 55:36.602
They must invited all the Beys from
Seljuk Empire and Oghuz Tribes.

55:38.269 --> 55:40.069
Why does Oghuz Tribes gather?

55:40.702 --> 55:45.736
White beards are going to form a group
in case Mongols come to Anatolia.

55:46.969 --> 55:48.602
I hope we will succeed, Afsin Bey.

55:49.602 --> 55:53.202
Otherwise we will encounter a much
bigger danger than the crusaders.

55:55.002 --> 55:58.169
Mongols have sent their spies
to the corners of Anatolia.

55:58.402 --> 56:00.036
They are everywhere.

56:00.469 --> 56:02.602
We must be vigilant, Ertugrul Bey.

56:03.436 --> 56:05.102
If God permits, Afsin Bey.

56:07.669 --> 56:09.169
First we should go back
to the nomad group.

56:09.569 --> 56:13.402
We have not tasted victory for a
long time. It will reassure everyone.

56:15.069 --> 56:16.602
Thanks to you, Bey.

56:16.669 --> 56:18.236
Thanks to you.

56:18.736 --> 56:20.369
Thank you, Afsin Bey.

56:21.569 --> 56:25.236
Campaign is ours,
but the victory belongs to God.

56:26.302 --> 56:28.369
We don't want to be late for the
praise prayer.

58:34.643 --> 58:41.043
I intend to perform two rakat of praise
prayer in the name of God.

58:43.410 --> 58:44.543
God is great!

58:57.376 --> 58:58.510
God is great!

59:02.943 --> 59:07.343
God hears all of his creatures.
God is great!

59:16.343 --> 59:17.676
God is great!

59:20.343 --> 59:21.743
God is great!

59:33.310 --> 59:34.610
God is great!

59:37.910 --> 59:41.876
God hears all of his creatures.

59:46.310 --> 59:47.610
God is great!

59:48.843 --> 59:50.610
God is great!

59:53.643 --> 59:55.476
God is great!

01:00:08.343 --> 01:00:13.543
God's mercy and grace be upon you.

01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:21.110
My supreme God, who is the maker
of the sky and land.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:24.810
We belong to you and
we will surely return you.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:28.010
Do not abandoned us.

01:00:28.343 --> 01:00:29.510
Amen!

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:31.576
Bless our battle.

01:00:31.943 --> 01:00:33.010
Amen!

01:00:33.076 --> 01:00:35.576
Never let us deviate from your path.

01:00:35.743 --> 01:00:36.876
Amen!

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:39.543
Take our martyrs beside you.

01:00:39.676 --> 01:00:40.810
Amen!

01:00:41.643 --> 01:00:45.543
Let the world of Islam be reborn.

01:00:45.743 --> 01:00:46.743
Amen!

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:48.343
<i>Al Fatihah.</i>

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:09.476
My brave sons who conquer castles.

01:01:09.976 --> 01:01:11.710
Everything has an end.

01:01:12.076 --> 01:01:15.476
My life is about to come to an end.

01:01:16.043 --> 01:01:20.476
Maybe this was my last battle with you.

01:01:21.843 --> 01:01:26.343
My legacy to you is that you
should never avoid battle.

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:30.076
Do not betray your Bey, your traditions

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:35.410
your people and your religion
like Kurtoglu.

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:39.610
A handful of men conquered this castle

01:01:40.343 --> 01:01:43.710
with their faith and courage.

01:01:44.476 --> 01:01:48.043
Do not ruin your unity and peace.

01:01:49.043 --> 01:01:53.476
May God always be with you!

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:55.643
Amen!

56:44.761 --> 56:49.727
The best way to deal with the desert sun
and sandstorm is our tents.

56:50.694 --> 56:51.727
Yes.

56:52.227 --> 56:55.361
Girls! Stretch them more.

56:55.961 --> 56:56.994
Stretch it.

56:57.227 --> 57:00.127
Stretch it so that the tent breathes
in the summer and...

57:00.861 --> 57:05.161
...never lets rain and cold
inside in winter.

57:05.227 --> 57:06.627
Okay, Mother Hayme.

57:07.794 --> 57:11.727
Mother Hayme, do not worry.
Ertugrul Bey will not get cold.

57:25.761 --> 57:30.927
Although he went to so many battles
and he challenges the whole world...

57:32.127 --> 57:34.094
...he is always going to be
your little son.

57:37.094 --> 57:38.594
Yes.

57:41.227 --> 57:46.261
He has never slept outside
even when the marquee was full.

57:46.994 --> 57:48.927
This is not about boy or girl.

57:50.227 --> 57:52.561
Another bird is going to fly away
from the nest.

57:55.761 --> 57:58.094
Even though
you will be under my nose every day...

58:00.061 --> 58:02.061
I do not know.

58:05.194 --> 58:06.961
I cannot replace you, Mother.

58:08.594 --> 58:11.227
But, we will take care of each other
very well. I promise.

58:14.327 --> 58:17.127
I know, my beautiful daughter. I know.

58:20.827 --> 58:22.361
Tie them tightly.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.241
Let the place level with the ground.

01:02:18.974 --> 01:02:22.841
Let them not resort to get inside
of this snake nest again.

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:24.541
Do not worry, Bey.

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:27.707
We will lay this place to waste.
May God speed you.

01:02:29.241 --> 01:02:33.074
Hamza!
You will bring our martyrs after us.

01:02:33.241 --> 01:02:34.707
As you command, Bey.

01:04:10.174 --> 01:04:12.307
Finally, I finished this.

01:04:16.041 --> 01:04:17.541
Halime!

01:04:18.041 --> 01:04:19.041
What is wrong?

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.874
Why are you sad now?

01:04:27.174 --> 01:04:29.107
I remember my father.

01:04:32.607 --> 01:04:34.341
All those sufferings
he had through for years.

01:04:36.107 --> 01:04:39.841
His struggle to save the honor of
Seljukian Dynasty.

01:04:42.974 --> 01:04:44.607
Then his surrender.

01:04:47.607 --> 01:04:49.807
Sometimes I think...

01:04:50.741 --> 01:04:52.341
...that my father
overlooked certain things.

01:04:53.207 --> 01:04:55.907
Otherwise there is no explanation of
his aspiration of the throne.

01:05:00.107 --> 01:05:03.741
He resisted and struggled all his life.

01:05:04.174 --> 01:05:05.641
And then...

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:13.807
I wish he were here and saw my happy day.

01:05:17.841 --> 01:05:19.707
Rest in peace.

01:05:21.307 --> 01:05:22.641
He was a very good man.

01:05:24.541 --> 01:05:28.107
I am sure he would have been
very happy for you if he were alive.

01:05:28.241 --> 01:05:30.341
He liked Ertugrul very much.

01:05:31.174 --> 01:05:32.707
Very much.

01:05:36.574 --> 01:05:37.941
Thank you, Aykiz.

01:05:53.807 --> 01:05:56.274
<i>I will not stop until I die, Ertugrul.</i>

01:05:56.541 --> 01:05:59.174
<i>Soon you will pay for what you have done.</i>

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:42.574
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

01:06:42.641 --> 01:06:47.707
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

01:06:47.874 --> 01:06:51.274
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

01:07:06.207 --> 01:07:11.541
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

01:07:12.574 --> 01:07:18.341
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

01:07:19.141 --> 01:07:22.274
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

01:07:59.674 --> 01:08:04.774
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

01:08:05.607 --> 01:08:10.674
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

01:08:10.841 --> 01:08:16.607
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

01:08:30.307 --> 01:08:33.874
We did not do anything
other than God's orders.

01:08:35.141 --> 01:08:37.074
We were not cruels.

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.841
We took every step with gratitude.

01:08:42.074 --> 01:08:44.741
We enlivened every land we stepped on...

01:08:44.941 --> 01:08:47.174
...with the light of Islam.

01:08:48.841 --> 01:08:50.174
We are Alps.

01:08:51.274 --> 01:08:54.774
Our occupation is to follow God's way.

01:08:56.341 --> 01:09:00.207
Our aim is to spread God's religion.

01:09:02.307 --> 01:09:05.207
We brought the Templars' castle
down on them.

01:09:06.907 --> 01:09:09.007
We routed the home of instigation.

01:09:09.974 --> 01:09:12.041
The war booties are going to be...

01:09:13.074 --> 01:09:17.607
...distributed to everyone equally
including me.

01:09:18.941 --> 01:09:21.107
I wish mercy for our...

01:09:21.307 --> 01:09:27.141
...martyrs who did not leave the battle
and made us victors.

01:09:27.641 --> 01:09:28.774
Amen!

01:09:30.341 --> 01:09:32.707
May God bless all of them!

01:09:33.074 --> 01:09:34.641
Amen!

01:09:34.707 --> 01:09:40.207
Allahu Akbar!

01:09:40.674 --> 01:09:46.141
Allahu Akbar!

01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:53.607
Allahu Akbar!

01:09:53.974 --> 01:10:00.941
Allahu Akbar!

01:10:14.074 --> 01:10:15.874
Welcome to your marquee, Bey.

01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:18.007
Thank you, Hayme.

01:10:18.774 --> 01:10:21.741
Thank God we came back
from another battle safely.

01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:23.241
Thankfully.

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:31.141
Suleyman, are you alright?

01:10:33.307 --> 01:10:34.707
I am fine, Hayme.

01:10:35.007 --> 01:10:36.041
Do not worry.

01:10:36.141 --> 01:10:37.674
How can I not worry?

01:10:37.907 --> 01:10:40.107
You went to battle
with this wound on your back.

01:10:40.841 --> 01:10:43.741
You came back with victories.

01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:46.207
Thank you. Live long, Bey.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:54.707
You live long, as well, Hayme.

01:10:55.541 --> 01:10:58.274
We got news.
All Oghuz tribes will get together.

01:10:59.674 --> 01:11:01.674
Will you go there like this?

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:03.741
I have to go, Hayme.

01:11:05.007 --> 01:11:09.841
I have served to Kayis
and the Oghuz tribe for all my life.

01:11:10.341 --> 01:11:15.241
I know. You have gone to battle
and hunting with all of them.

01:11:15.774 --> 01:11:18.341
You guided them so many times.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:22.641
But, I wish we cleaned that wound first.

01:11:22.841 --> 01:11:26.241
This is why
I have to go to that congress, Hayme.

01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:32.607
There is a chance that
I will not return from this mission.

01:11:32.674 --> 01:11:34.607
Why are you talking like that, Suleyman?

01:11:34.674 --> 01:11:36.574
Please do not say that.

01:11:36.774 --> 01:11:38.674
I have lived enough.

01:11:39.141 --> 01:11:43.907
I served to my religion and my family
as much as I could.

01:11:44.607 --> 01:11:49.041
I would like to see
Ertugrul's wedding before I die.

01:11:49.307 --> 01:11:50.807
What are you saying, Bey?

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:54.007
-You will see your grandchildren.
-If God permits, Hayme.

01:11:54.141 --> 01:11:56.341
Let us deal with this
before I go to Ahlat.

01:11:58.741 --> 01:11:59.907
Do not worry, Bey.

01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:02.674
I started the preparations right away.

01:12:03.141 --> 01:12:07.241
There is so much pain going on.
The wedding shall not be festive, Hayme.

01:12:07.607 --> 01:12:08.607
I know.

01:12:08.807 --> 01:12:10.607
Do not worry, Bey.

01:12:44.707 --> 01:12:47.007
I just wanted
to congratulate your victory.

01:12:48.107 --> 01:12:49.674
Thank you.

01:12:50.874 --> 01:12:52.707
I have something to say.

01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:56.174
Tell me.

01:12:56.874 --> 01:12:58.907
I wonder what lies you will tell
this time.

01:13:00.641 --> 01:13:01.774
I am...

01:13:04.174 --> 01:13:05.841
I am pregnant.

01:13:15.207 --> 01:13:17.207
Do you think I am stupid, woman?

01:13:20.674 --> 01:13:21.774
Selcan...

01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:26.074
...do you have any pride,
honor or modesty?

01:13:27.174 --> 01:13:29.307
I do not believe these lies anymore.

01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:33.141
Go before I say something bad.

01:13:34.141 --> 01:13:35.307
Get out!

01:13:39.341 --> 01:13:41.141
As you wish, Gundogdu.

01:13:41.974 --> 01:13:45.707
However, you should know that
my words were true.

01:13:46.341 --> 01:13:49.074
To hell with you and your words.

01:14:33.174 --> 01:14:36.907
Even though I sent you to war
as if sending you to a wedding...

01:14:37.774 --> 01:14:39.541
...it cuts me to the quick, Turgut.

01:14:40.707 --> 01:14:43.307
I felt like your battle lasted for years.

01:14:45.907 --> 01:14:49.874
I waited for years
to come together with my Aykiz.

01:14:50.641 --> 01:14:53.707
As long as I have your love,
neither the infidels' arrows...

01:14:54.774 --> 01:14:58.674
...nor their swords will hurt me.

01:15:01.141 --> 01:15:07.307
You think I don't know my sorrowful violet
is longing for me in our tent?

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.207
Do you think I do not?

01:15:10.841 --> 01:15:15.007
How could I not run to you
knowing that, Aykiz?

01:15:26.841 --> 01:15:29.907
Then, my faith shall be your weapon...

01:15:30.741 --> 01:15:33.174
...and my patience
shall be your shield, my brave man.

01:15:53.907 --> 01:15:55.641
Do I have permission, Bey?

01:15:56.141 --> 01:15:57.641
Come in.

01:16:01.841 --> 01:16:03.841
Come in, sister Gokce.

01:16:06.007 --> 01:16:08.174
I wanted to ask you
if you need anything, Bey.

01:16:08.707 --> 01:16:10.641
Thank you.

01:16:12.041 --> 01:16:13.207
I do not.

01:16:21.007 --> 01:16:22.341
I know, Bey.

01:16:23.074 --> 01:16:25.574
What my sister did, aches your heart.

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.774
It devastated me as well.

01:16:30.574 --> 01:16:32.807
She is the one who dragged
our nomad tent to trouble.

01:16:35.941 --> 01:16:39.607
Your sister killed the human inside me,
Gokce Hatun.

01:16:40.774 --> 01:16:43.307
I have thought of her...

01:16:43.841 --> 01:16:46.074
...as my woman
since the day I came to my senses.

01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:52.307
However, your sister thought me
as a ride for her marquee.

01:16:54.774 --> 01:16:57.974
Now she says that she is pregnant.

01:16:59.007 --> 01:17:00.874
Just for me not to divorce her.

01:17:03.541 --> 01:17:05.274
So she is still into playing games.

01:17:05.841 --> 01:17:07.607
Old habits die hard.

01:17:13.674 --> 01:17:14.874
What about you, Bey?

01:17:15.974 --> 01:17:17.807
Why do you not divorce my sister?

01:17:19.274 --> 01:17:21.074
It is on the tip of my tongue.

01:17:21.841 --> 01:17:23.707
But...

01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:29.907
...my heart does not let me.

01:17:43.741 --> 01:17:46.141
You brought me my brother, Ertugrul Bey.

01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:48.941
You made me happy.

01:17:58.141 --> 01:18:00.007
I gave you a promise, Halime Sultan.

01:18:00.741 --> 01:18:03.274
I would either bring him back or die.

01:18:05.541 --> 01:18:07.674
You collapsed that cruels castle, as well.

01:18:08.941 --> 01:18:10.974
Now the instigation will end.

01:18:12.641 --> 01:18:14.874
They say the Mongol bandits are all over.

01:18:16.774 --> 01:18:19.307
Do the enemies of the justice army
ever end, Halime Sultan?

01:18:19.974 --> 01:18:23.041
May our enemy never end,
so that our battles increase.

01:18:28.641 --> 01:18:30.107
Forget that now.

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:33.607
Is everything ready for the wedding?

01:18:35.074 --> 01:18:37.307
We prepared our tent with Mother Hayme.

01:18:44.907 --> 01:18:48.074
However, you will not see it
before the wedding.

01:18:52.841 --> 01:18:54.141
Promise?

01:18:55.574 --> 01:18:57.074
Promise.

01:19:44.041 --> 01:19:45.241
My Gokce.

01:19:51.207 --> 01:19:53.307
How long will this continue, sister?

01:19:55.007 --> 01:19:56.974
How long will you keep on
playing this game?

01:19:57.941 --> 01:19:59.307
What game are you talking about?

01:20:00.741 --> 01:20:02.207
What are you saying?

01:20:02.941 --> 01:20:09.141
After all those lies and slanders,
what made you became a religious women?

01:20:11.007 --> 01:20:12.307
Don't talk like that, Gokce.

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.041
Sister, enough!

01:20:14.907 --> 01:20:17.207
You were the one
behind every instigation with Kurtoglu.

01:20:18.774 --> 01:20:23.041
How did you become as pure as the
driven snow? Tell me, how?

01:20:27.841 --> 01:20:29.841
I am speechless for your words.

01:20:31.107 --> 01:20:36.307
My lips crack. My heart aches.

01:20:38.974 --> 01:20:41.541
Words fail me, my dear.

01:20:42.674 --> 01:20:44.007
However...

01:20:44.807 --> 01:20:48.841
...if the devil inside me
was still alive...

01:20:49.174 --> 01:20:53.841
...would I have confessed all my sins?

01:20:55.107 --> 01:20:57.074
You are such a devilish woman, sister...

01:20:57.674 --> 01:21:00.307
If you do something, there are
definitely many instigations behind it.

01:21:00.907 --> 01:21:02.841
How could you expect me to
believe you after all...

01:21:04.074 --> 01:21:06.174
...you have done?

01:21:06.907 --> 01:21:08.941
How could I believe you anymore?

01:21:10.674 --> 01:21:13.574
When Alp Argu came to the tent
to kill Ertugrul...

01:21:14.641 --> 01:21:16.774
...did you show the way to Kurtoglu?

01:21:19.607 --> 01:21:22.541
What is your role in
Alp Argu stabbing me on my groin...

01:21:23.241 --> 01:21:26.307
...so that I will not have a baby anymore?

01:21:27.141 --> 01:21:29.007
Tell me, what is your role?

01:21:37.674 --> 01:21:39.574
I hate you.

01:21:41.241 --> 01:21:43.041
I hate you sister.

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:44.774
Stop!

01:22:02.641 --> 01:22:06.941
If I sat in my tent silently
all this time...

01:22:09.274 --> 01:22:12.607
...it is because I waited for good news
from Gundogdu.

01:22:15.007 --> 01:22:17.774
Thankfully, I heard good news.

01:22:18.841 --> 01:22:20.174
My brave man is fine.

01:22:20.941 --> 01:22:22.174
So, from now on...

01:22:22.974 --> 01:22:25.941
...there is no need for me
in this nomad group.

01:22:27.074 --> 01:22:28.807
I am done here.

01:22:29.741 --> 01:22:31.807
This is what I say.

01:22:34.274 --> 01:22:35.907
As for your question...

01:22:38.841 --> 01:22:43.841
...yes, I had a role
in every instigation.

01:22:45.274 --> 01:22:49.841
If you will not have a baby,
I am responsible for this.

01:23:00.007 --> 01:23:01.674
No matter what you do...

01:23:03.941 --> 01:23:07.774
...you will never be able to erase
the disgrace of your heart, sister.

01:23:15.074 --> 01:23:18.041
May God speed you, my dear sister.

01:23:18.974 --> 01:23:20.907
I hope you find the happiness...

01:23:20.974 --> 01:23:24.674
...you are searching for
with your pure heart very soon.

01:23:52.174 --> 01:23:56.274
We have seen so many boils
and so many heads of boils.

01:23:57.674 --> 01:24:00.541
I will not be afraid of a boil on my back.

01:24:08.007 --> 01:24:11.974
Of course, God gives and takes lives,
Suleyman Shah.

01:24:13.141 --> 01:24:14.641
Brave Beys like you are...

01:24:15.541 --> 01:24:18.974
...not afraid of that boil.

01:24:20.141 --> 01:24:21.241
However...

01:24:21.907 --> 01:24:26.241
...if the will is from God,
the duty of precaution is on the servant.

01:24:27.241 --> 01:24:28.941
You should know this, as well.

01:24:30.007 --> 01:24:31.774
What should I do my Sheikh?

01:24:34.274 --> 01:24:40.707
I will prepare you a cure from herbs out
of respect for the name, Al Shafi.

01:24:40.974 --> 01:24:42.907
It will relieve your pain.

01:24:44.207 --> 01:24:51.007
However, you shall not hide your pain
either from your wife or me.

01:24:51.174 --> 01:24:52.541
It is obvious.

01:24:52.641 --> 01:24:56.741
You shall not think of this trouble
as unimportant.

01:24:58.974 --> 01:25:02.774
I say that you should not travel.

01:25:05.174 --> 01:25:10.307
Your sons became famous from the
Seljukian Palace to the Ayyubis Palace...

01:25:11.574 --> 01:25:16.274
...from the Pope's Palace
to the Emperor's Palace.

01:25:17.007 --> 01:25:19.774
They will represent you in the best way.

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:23.574
I do not doubt of that, my Sheikh.

01:25:24.007 --> 01:25:30.974
However there are definitely people like
Kurtoglu in the other nomad groups.

01:25:32.174 --> 01:25:34.641
I consent to die on the way
if I will have...

01:25:34.907 --> 01:25:39.807
...even a little bit contribution
to this big Islamic alliance.

01:25:44.941 --> 01:25:47.107
May God help you, then.

01:25:48.007 --> 01:25:49.341
Thank you.

01:25:55.174 --> 01:25:56.574
Do I have permission, Bey?

01:25:56.807 --> 01:25:57.874
Come in, Abdurrahman.

01:26:05.141 --> 01:26:06.974
Our martyrs are here, Bey.

01:32:10.274 --> 01:32:12.974
For the souls of our martyrs...

01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:14.907
<i>Al Fatihah.</i>

01:34:10.774 --> 01:34:12.641
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

01:34:38.541 --> 01:34:41.041
Ertugrul, Halime.

01:34:42.674 --> 01:34:45.574
I would like to perform your wedding
ceremony tomorrow night before I go...

01:34:47.007 --> 01:34:49.541
...to meet the Oghuz Tribes.

01:35:09.241 --> 01:35:11.674
You could not have given us
a more beautiful gift than this, father.

01:35:15.041 --> 01:35:16.941
You did what would make us the happiest.

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:56.841
It comes to my mind that you raised...

01:36:57.874 --> 01:37:02.674
...your eyebrows and held the weapons
when you saw the Mongol idolator, woman.

01:37:05.741 --> 01:37:06.874
It comes to my mind that...

01:37:07.641 --> 01:37:10.741
...you said we should
fight for our daughter, Aykiz.

01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:16.107
That you said the survivor of us
shall be both the father...

01:37:16.174 --> 01:37:19.941
...and the mother of Aykiz.

01:37:24.007 --> 01:37:26.174
You died at the battle like an Alp.

01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:29.207
Being both mother and father
was left to me.

01:37:33.041 --> 01:37:34.941
I wish I died...

01:37:35.207 --> 01:37:39.041
...and you became
the father and mother for our daughter.

01:37:42.341 --> 01:37:43.774
I wish you were alive.

01:37:44.074 --> 01:37:46.141
Then you would have done...

01:37:46.707 --> 01:37:49.107
...what I could not, somehow.

01:37:53.141 --> 01:37:54.607
Anyways.

01:37:56.174 --> 01:37:58.274
I got our daughter married.

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:02.941
Aykiz was with me since you were gone.

01:38:06.041 --> 01:38:08.274
Now, she is at another one's tent.

01:38:12.574 --> 01:38:14.907
I do not know how to cope with loneliness.

01:38:18.174 --> 01:38:22.007
I pray to God to end this every night.

01:38:25.174 --> 01:38:27.807
I miss you very much my wild flower.

01:38:28.707 --> 01:38:30.041
Very much.

01:38:32.307 --> 01:38:33.707
Do I have permission, father?

01:38:34.841 --> 01:38:36.974
Come in, my children.

01:38:45.807 --> 01:38:48.307
Eyrek Alp caught this partridge
in the hunt.

01:38:48.774 --> 01:38:50.274
He gave it to us.

01:38:51.174 --> 01:38:53.174
He wanted me to cook it for you.

01:38:53.841 --> 01:38:56.607
He said, "Let him eat this
and his wound will heal soon."

01:38:59.707 --> 01:39:00.741
Turgut?

01:39:01.341 --> 01:39:02.741
Yes, father?

01:39:03.074 --> 01:39:04.707
Aykiz...

01:39:06.174 --> 01:39:08.707
...I want a grandchild from you
right away.

01:39:09.074 --> 01:39:12.107
I want to hold him in my arms.

01:40:09.874 --> 01:40:12.974
Ameer El Aziz from Aleppo wants to
meet your Bey, Suleyman Shah.

01:40:25.807 --> 01:40:28.107
Bey, El Aziz is here.

01:40:28.207 --> 01:40:29.907
He wants to meet you.

01:40:30.241 --> 01:40:32.274
I say we should not make El Aziz
wait too long, father.

01:40:34.941 --> 01:40:36.741
Let him in.

01:40:58.607 --> 01:40:59.774
You can go in.

01:41:17.274 --> 01:41:19.041
Welcome, El Aziz.

01:41:19.707 --> 01:41:20.774
Thank you.

01:41:21.741 --> 01:41:22.941
I was headed to Egypt.

01:41:23.907 --> 01:41:26.341
There might be no coming back either.

01:41:27.274 --> 01:41:30.707
I wanted to see you for the last time,
while I am still alive, Suleyman Shah.

01:41:31.741 --> 01:41:36.307
Although you humiliated me
the last time I saw you.

01:41:37.874 --> 01:41:40.607
<i>What will you do if I gather my armies...</i>

01:41:40.674 --> 01:41:41.674
<i>...and advance on you?</i>

01:41:41.774 --> 01:41:44.007
<i>How do you talk me like that?</i>
 <i>Who do you trust?</i>

01:41:44.307 --> 01:41:46.574
<i>We trust whoever we trusted and...</i>

01:41:46.707 --> 01:41:49.907
<i>...said with God's help when you threw us</i>
 <i>in front of the Crusaders.</i>

01:41:50.007 --> 01:41:51.274
<i>Do not forget Ameer ...</i>

01:41:51.707 --> 01:41:55.141
<i>...we Kayis believe in God,</i>
 <i>trust in God and take refugee of God.</i>

01:41:55.774 --> 01:41:57.841
<i>If your army is bigger than that,</i>
 <i>bring it on!</i>

01:42:04.741 --> 01:42:08.041
There is nothing better to show the way
to a man who has gone off track...

01:42:08.107 --> 01:42:11.074
...like the telling off of a
brave and honest man like you.

01:42:16.107 --> 01:42:17.807
Welcome, El Aziz.

01:42:18.041 --> 01:42:19.641
Thank you, brother.

01:42:26.741 --> 01:42:28.041
Please.

01:42:34.841 --> 01:42:37.141
Melike Adile and Sultan Alaeddin
got married.

01:42:38.541 --> 01:42:40.841
This is a propitious marriage
for the world of Islam.

01:42:41.541 --> 01:42:45.107
I told about the contributions of you
and Gundogdu Bey...

01:42:45.541 --> 01:42:49.841
...for this marriage to happen in
the letter I wrote to Sultan Alaeddin.

01:42:51.207 --> 01:42:56.007
It is praiseworthy that you brought
the Templars' castle down on them.

01:42:57.207 --> 01:43:00.241
May God bless you and your martyrs.

01:43:01.874 --> 01:43:03.307
Amen!

01:43:04.941 --> 01:43:09.607
The reason why I came here is that
I would like our friendship last forever.

01:43:10.707 --> 01:43:14.607
I believe that you will support
the Seljukian and Ayyubians alliance.

01:43:15.207 --> 01:43:17.841
We hold all the efforts for peace
in high esteem...

01:43:17.907 --> 01:43:23.574
...El Aziz.

01:43:25.174 --> 01:43:27.907
I told you a word back then,
do you remember El Aziz?

01:43:28.041 --> 01:43:29.041
Remind me.

01:43:29.674 --> 01:43:32.074
We fight so much that
our swords do not get into their sheaths.

01:43:32.174 --> 01:43:33.874
Our horses never fear of the battle.

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:35.641
As long as we have an alliance to carry...

01:43:35.741 --> 01:43:38.707
A bowl of water to the fire at home.

01:43:42.174 --> 01:43:46.041
My brave brother who always stands
behind his words...

01:43:47.841 --> 01:43:48.941
Suleyman Shah...

01:43:50.107 --> 01:43:53.841
...there is enough coin to buy
all of your herd.

01:44:11.607 --> 01:44:12.741
In this chest...

01:44:15.541 --> 01:44:18.941
...there are gifts for brother Ertugrul
and Halime Sultan's wedding...

01:44:19.674 --> 01:44:24.741
...from not only me but also
Ayyubi Dynasty.

01:44:25.841 --> 01:44:31.574
If you accept, you would honor
the descendants of Salahuddin Ayyubi.

01:45:12.863 --> 01:45:15.996
If holy God allows you to be
born healthy...

01:45:17.763 --> 01:45:19.930
...I will take you to your dad.

01:45:23.396 --> 01:45:28.563
How can a sinful woman like me dare...

01:45:29.663 --> 01:45:33.730
...to bring up the child of such a brave
courageous father, my little one?

01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:41.896
However, you must know that...

01:45:42.563 --> 01:45:45.630
...your mother will always love you
so much.

01:45:47.596 --> 01:45:52.396
While dying and citing God's name...

01:45:53.130 --> 01:45:55.863
...you will always be on my lips.

01:45:59.563 --> 01:46:02.463
Forgive your poor mother
my little one...

01:46:04.496 --> 01:46:07.563
...forgive your sinful mother.

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:11.030
Forgive.

01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:32.930
May I have your permission, Bey?

01:46:33.330 --> 01:46:34.763
Come in, son.

01:46:39.763 --> 01:46:41.063
You ordered me to come.

01:46:41.696 --> 01:46:42.963
Be seated.

01:46:47.796 --> 01:46:50.030
We want to talk about Selcan with you.

01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:56.963
You told everything was over
when Selcan confessed every sin...

01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:59.996
...she committed.

01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:03.030
Even that you would divorce her.

01:47:04.863 --> 01:47:10.130
Then, you told us did not know
what to do and asked for some time.

01:47:10.763 --> 01:47:12.930
However, enough time has passed.

01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:15.996
Do you know what to do now, son?

01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:20.130
Father, Mother.

01:47:21.996 --> 01:47:25.330
I told Selcan "I divorce you!"
twice in the tent.

01:47:26.696 --> 01:47:28.863
When I was about to say it
the third time...

01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:32.863
...she put my dagger to my hands
and begged me to kill her.

01:47:34.996 --> 01:47:37.630
That moment haunted me.

01:47:37.963 --> 01:47:39.730
I did not know what to do.

01:47:40.096 --> 01:47:41.996
But you must make a decision.

01:47:48.096 --> 01:47:49.763
What do you think?

01:47:51.796 --> 01:47:57.463
Selcan is on her way to repent
and determined her will.

01:48:00.463 --> 01:48:02.896
I say, open your tent to her
one last time.

01:48:23.563 --> 01:48:24.763
Bey.

01:48:39.330 --> 01:48:41.496
A small present, the least I can do.

01:48:46.330 --> 01:48:49.563
Fox fur. It is beneath you.

01:48:54.763 --> 01:49:00.796
I will carry these furs for my three brave
Alps, until I die.

01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:05.130
I grew up with you.

01:49:06.596 --> 01:49:08.130
I met the sword with you...

01:49:09.796 --> 01:49:11.663
...learned how to use it with you.

01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:16.996
You taught that the Alps are the ones
make a hunt worthy...

01:49:17.063 --> 01:49:18.330
...and a man into a Bey.

01:49:21.730 --> 01:49:24.863
Whatever I learned,
you were always beside me.

01:49:27.096 --> 01:49:29.063
If I became the head of the Alps...

01:49:29.963 --> 01:49:32.030
...if I am one of those trusted with
a duty...

01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:34.796
...your contribution in this is great.

01:49:36.630 --> 01:49:40.730
If I deserve to be your Bey...

01:49:41.896 --> 01:49:43.463
...how happy I am!

01:49:45.663 --> 01:49:46.963
Bey!

01:49:53.596 --> 01:49:55.763
May God keep you beside us!

01:49:56.630 --> 01:49:58.963
May you be happy all your life,
if God permits.

01:49:59.063 --> 01:50:01.730
Thank you Turgut, thank you.

01:50:06.696 --> 01:50:09.463
May you be happy with Halime Sultan
throughout your life, Bey.

01:50:10.463 --> 01:50:11.663
Thank you Dogan.

01:50:18.763 --> 01:50:20.130
What is wrong big man?

01:50:21.563 --> 01:50:23.496
He is miserable because you got married,
Bey.

01:50:26.763 --> 01:50:28.096
I do not know Bey...

01:50:28.530 --> 01:50:32.796
...I thought that you would marry
your armor, love your horse as a child...

01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:35.430
...like I do, I was keep telling myself.

01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:47.663
Bey, this if for my sister, Halime Sultan.

01:50:51.763 --> 01:50:52.930
Your precious?

01:50:54.096 --> 01:50:56.030
-My precious, Bey.
-Kudret.

01:51:03.363 --> 01:51:07.363
May God give you happiness, Bey.
Make you fortunate.

01:51:08.096 --> 01:51:09.130
What can I say?

01:51:09.663 --> 01:51:11.663
May God give you many children, Bey.

01:51:11.896 --> 01:51:14.896
Three, five, eight...

01:51:15.096 --> 01:51:17.330
Take how many God may give you, Bey.

01:51:17.396 --> 01:51:19.830
If God permits. If God permits!

01:51:25.496 --> 01:51:26.563
Do not worry Bamsi.

01:51:26.630 --> 01:51:28.963
We can find a wife for you,
from Banu Cicek's nomad tent as well.

01:51:30.096 --> 01:51:36.096
Stop there Dogan! Stop! Stop it!

01:51:38.630 --> 01:51:40.663
Sensitive bear!

01:53:59.496 --> 01:54:01.663
I applied henna on you. For what?

01:54:01.763 --> 01:54:05.563
To be sacrificed to the tent of my brave
man who I am getting married to.

01:54:05.896 --> 01:54:07.363
What else for?

01:54:07.563 --> 01:54:10.730
To know how to apply it to the back of
sacrificial  lamb at feast of sacrifice...

01:54:10.796 --> 01:54:14.996
...on palms of my Alp when
he is going to war.

01:54:15.463 --> 01:54:17.763
What else? What else for?

01:54:18.096 --> 01:54:21.730
To listen to holy azan of Mohammad...

01:54:21.796 --> 01:54:25.463
...may our customs, the souvenir
of our ancestors be everlasting.

01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:29.963
May your happiness be everlasting,
Halime Sultan.

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:33.630
May your happiness be everlasting,
Halime Sultan.

01:54:34.130 --> 01:54:37.096
May your happiness be everlasting,
Halime Sultan.

01:54:53.763 --> 01:54:56.463
The day you have been waiting for
has arrives, is it not Ertugrul?

01:54:57.730 --> 01:54:58.930
Thanks to you.

01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:03.496
You have become my compass.
You lead me in my darkest hours.

01:55:04.630 --> 01:55:08.363
When I thought I was left in the dark,
you became my light.

01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:12.363
And thanks to you I am getting married
to the woman I love.

01:55:12.896 --> 01:55:19.330
How happy for you! Let your nomad people,
nomad tent, tribe, kin and your nation...

01:55:19.396 --> 01:55:21.130
...last forever with your happiness.

01:55:21.563 --> 01:55:25.630
May the fruits of your marriage
take hold of the world.

01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:27.496
Thank you.

01:55:27.696 --> 01:55:33.830
After we solemnize you, right after the
morning prayer, I will hit the roads, son.

01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:37.896
I hope to see you again, if God permits.

01:55:37.963 --> 01:55:40.463
If God permit we will see each other.

01:55:43.396 --> 01:55:45.696
If you will go, let me bring you
the deposit.

01:55:47.463 --> 01:55:49.796
It is not a deposit anymore Ertugrul.

01:55:50.796 --> 01:55:54.496
It has found its owner, thank God.

01:56:27.330 --> 01:56:32.963
You were not only a sister but also
a mother to me while there were...

01:56:34.130 --> 01:56:37.563
...lots of enemies, wanting to kill us,
to use us putting in prison.

01:56:37.963 --> 01:56:40.063
I will never be able to make up for what
you did for me, sister.

01:56:40.730 --> 01:56:45.730
If I was able to find my brave man who
I have been looking for my whole life...

01:56:46.796 --> 01:56:49.630
...and marry him and make a home
with him you contributed greatly.

01:56:50.096 --> 01:56:51.930
Especially me, I will never pay you back.

01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:54.896
My dear brother.

01:57:00.730 --> 01:57:01.963
Permission?

01:57:02.696 --> 01:57:04.130
Come in Ertugrul Bey.

01:57:15.496 --> 01:57:20.363
I entrusted you not only my sister,
but my dear, my beloved.

01:57:21.463 --> 01:57:23.663
Take good care of my precious,
Ertugrul Bey.

01:57:24.896 --> 01:57:29.730
Show your fist's power to the enemy
and your heart's mercy to my sister.

01:57:30.896 --> 01:57:32.730
May God make you happy and felicitous.

01:57:40.896 --> 01:57:42.796
A gazelle brought her to me.

01:57:46.096 --> 01:57:49.630
While I am thanking my God who sent
that gazelle to me, every single day...

01:57:49.696 --> 01:57:53.096
...how can I break her heart, hurt her?

01:57:56.696 --> 01:57:59.063
I rather that God would take my life...

01:57:59.330 --> 01:58:01.663
...a thousand times instead of letting me
live through that.

01:58:49.863 --> 01:58:54.363
So Selcan Hatun, you reap what you sow.

01:58:55.530 --> 01:58:57.663
It is time to leave.

01:58:58.996 --> 01:59:01.863
Let us see what lies in your destiny.

01:59:40.096 --> 01:59:43.796
Everybody keep your hands open,
do not tie them.

01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:46.096
And say it with me.

01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:48.896
For our sins...

01:59:49.496 --> 01:59:50.596
<i>...we swear not to repeat them.</i>

01:59:50.663 --> 01:59:51.830
<i>We swear not to repeat them.</i>

01:59:51.929 --> 01:59:53.963

<i>-We swear.</i>

01:59:56.863 --> 01:59:59.896
<i>For He is the Greatest.</i>

02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:03.663
<i>For there is no deity but Him.</i>

02:00:03.930 --> 02:00:07.563
<i>He is the owner of everything.</i>

02:00:07.896 --> 02:00:09.496
<i>We ask His forgiveness.</i>

02:00:09.730 --> 02:00:12.630
<i>We believe in God and in His angels...</i>

02:00:12.763 --> 02:00:16.730
<i>...and in His books and in His Prophets...</i>

02:00:16.930 --> 02:00:21.963
<i>...and in the day of reckoning</i>
 <i>and in destiny.</i>

02:00:22.763 --> 02:00:25.396
<i>We believe that goodness and malice</i>
 <i>are all His creations.</i>

02:00:25.796 --> 02:00:29.396
<i>There is no deity but God and Muhammad</i>
 <i>is his Prophet and subject.</i>

02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:36.030

with the son of Suleyman, Ertugrul...
