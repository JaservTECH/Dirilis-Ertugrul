00:00.000 --> 00:02.517
Episode 16 will start after 12:13 min

12:13.381 --> 12:16.381
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:18.708 --> 12:21.708
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:22.910 --> 12:25.910
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.946
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS
FORT OF THE TEMPLARS

12:54.730 --> 12:56.197
Uncle, stop this.

13:12.097 --> 13:13.830
That is enough, Titus.

13:24.430 --> 13:26.464
Are you ready, brother Judas?

13:27.397 --> 13:28.697
I am.

13:30.264 --> 13:31.597
Rise, then.

15:21.464 --> 15:22.864
Afsin Bey.

15:24.164 --> 15:28.564
I respect your age, however you should
know that we do not trust  you.

15:36.664 --> 15:42.497
Whatever. Just be cautious.
Titus will bring Turgut soon.

15:48.564 --> 15:50.097
Are you ready?

15:51.497 --> 15:53.664
I am always ready, son.

15:53.763 --> 15:56.864
You cannot escape God's will.

15:57.097 --> 16:03.330
Ertugrul Bey, just let me
smash this monkey's face before the trade.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.763
We promised them, Afsin Bey.

16:10.864 --> 16:14.730
If they do not keep their promise,
his blood is yours.

16:25.730 --> 16:27.264
Let us get on the horses.

16:27.330 --> 16:30.630
You know how to communicate with me
if anything happens.

16:38.497 --> 16:42.564
We cannot trust them.
They will do something wicked for sure.

16:44.397 --> 16:46.064
We will see.

16:52.730 --> 16:54.330
Bey...

16:55.064 --> 16:56.664
Be careful.

16:58.430 --> 17:00.164
You, too, Dogan.

17:00.230 --> 17:01.530
You, too.

18:23.064 --> 18:25.530
We will walk for the rest of the way.

18:52.864 --> 18:55.664
I do not know
why our Bey trusted this man.

18:55.730 --> 18:58.164
Let us see how it turns out.

19:27.164 --> 19:29.397
They say that you killed the Pope.

19:32.430 --> 19:34.764
Is it Afsin who told this to you?

19:36.697 --> 19:39.364
I am surprised I am even famous here.

19:40.397 --> 19:43.197
I first met Afsin Bey in Konstantiniyye.

19:45.830 --> 19:48.497
Let me tell you something, Ertugrul.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.830
Shahzade Numan...

19:52.597 --> 19:54.730
Who do you think killed him?

19:58.264 --> 20:03.630
Do you think Afsin is the
dark hand of the state?

20:29.430 --> 20:31.530
We will go on alone.

21:56.797 --> 21:58.230
They are coming.

22:00.297 --> 22:01.730
Of course they are.

22:02.464 --> 22:04.564
I am more valuable than your Alp.

22:06.797 --> 22:10.197
To me, you are not
anything more than a leech...

22:10.297 --> 22:12.797
...that sucks the blood of
poor Christians.

22:32.130 --> 22:34.297
I hope it is not a trap.

22:36.697 --> 22:38.230
What is it?

22:39.197 --> 22:42.297
Enough. Enough nagging at me.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.530
My brother Turgut can take him by himself.

22:46.597 --> 22:51.330
If there is any problem with him,
Ertugrul Bey will take care of him.

22:52.364 --> 22:55.797
Maybe Turgut is the trap itself.

23:00.730 --> 23:02.797
What is he talking about?

23:47.764 --> 23:49.464
So we meet again, Turk.

23:55.298 --> 24:02.298
{\an8}THREE DAYS AGO

24:08.131 --> 24:12.731
-Oh my God.
-Oh mey Goodness.

24:37.464 --> 24:39.398
The time has come, Wild Demir.

24:40.431 --> 24:43.331
The time to revolt
against persecution has come.

24:44.398 --> 24:48.631
We came to this land
with so many hopes, Bey.

24:49.464 --> 24:54.264
We wanted to be happy,
but everything went so bad.

24:54.798 --> 24:57.764
I would not want to be called a man...

24:57.864 --> 25:02.298
...unless I make the ones
who put us into trouble pay for this.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.564
What is in your mind, Bey?

25:08.298 --> 25:09.831
I will take Turgut.

25:11.131 --> 25:14.498
Aykiz says that nobody
can pass through that castle.

25:15.298 --> 25:18.431
Neither through its walls nor its door.

25:19.664 --> 25:23.898
There is a key for each lock,
and a brave man for each wall.

25:25.164 --> 25:29.331
If we cannot take Turgut,
then we will die for the sake of it.

25:32.531 --> 25:37.364
If you bring Turgut back here,
Aykiz will be happy again.

25:37.698 --> 25:42.164
I gave my word to Aykiz.
We will marry them in this land.

25:43.131 --> 25:45.664
Hopefully, Bey. Hopefully.

25:50.298 --> 25:53.131
I am setting off.
We are leaving with the Alps.

25:53.231 --> 25:54.831
Good luck, Bey.

25:55.598 --> 25:57.531
I will see you before we leave.

25:57.598 --> 25:58.831
Thank you, Bey.

26:08.164 --> 26:11.531
Kara Toygar walked over everything,
but El Aziz destroyed everything.

26:11.598 --> 26:14.564
And there are the Crusaders.
What are we going to do?

26:14.664 --> 26:19.264
My flock was more well-fed
when the Mongols were after us.

26:19.364 --> 26:24.298
Now we have
only 40 skinny cattle. Why?

26:24.364 --> 26:27.764
Because there is not anybody
we did not challenge.

26:28.564 --> 26:32.831
All our children's livelihood is lost.

26:33.498 --> 26:37.264
-That is right, Bey. That is right.
-That is right. This is unacceptable.

26:37.331 --> 26:41.264
I will sell these cattle.
I tell you that.

26:41.498 --> 26:44.664
What would you expect
from this flock, Bey?

26:44.764 --> 26:49.464
The mother did not give any milk.
We could not benefit from it in any way.

26:49.531 --> 26:53.298
Who will buy them?
Nobody would want them.

26:53.398 --> 26:57.364
Merchants from Aleppo
have long stopped trading with Turkmens.

26:57.664 --> 27:01.198
Feed up your cattle
in this beautiful tent...

27:01.298 --> 27:04.864
...so that everything goes on well.

27:07.631 --> 27:12.564
Do not worry. I will sell them
with a good price.

27:14.198 --> 27:16.264
We know that you are different, Bey.

27:16.331 --> 27:18.231
You talk the language of our people.

27:18.298 --> 27:21.264
You know what the flock
and the shepherd wants.

27:22.298 --> 27:26.898
We saw you passed through treacherous
waters without losing even one of them.

27:27.131 --> 27:29.431
-That is right, Bey.
-That is right.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.098
You want peace, not war.

27:32.164 --> 27:33.864
Only you can do this, Bey.

27:34.131 --> 27:38.264
However, if we cannot sell this flock,
it will be very bad for us.

27:38.498 --> 27:43.264
Go and feed up your cattle, now.
It is my duty to deal with this.

27:43.331 --> 27:45.664
I will see you.

27:57.798 --> 27:59.798
What are we going to do?

27:59.898 --> 28:02.464
The shepherds' trouble
is the tent's trouble.

28:02.598 --> 28:06.631
There will not be peace in the tent
unless they are pleased.

28:07.531 --> 28:08.898
Tell me about it.

28:10.431 --> 28:14.831
There is a way, but I do not know
what your father would say.

28:18.098 --> 28:20.364
Listen to me carefully, Gundogdu.

28:36.598 --> 28:39.164
I see it is time for travel, Atabey.

28:39.831 --> 28:43.798
Ertugrul Bey,
I owe you not only my life...

28:45.364 --> 28:47.231
...you also saved Aleppo.

28:48.164 --> 28:50.598
You destroyed the Crusaders' order.

28:51.598 --> 28:55.698
One day, the Islamic world
will remember this hero with gratitude.

28:56.798 --> 28:58.398
Thank you.

28:59.231 --> 29:04.198
However, if we cannot unite
Anatolia and this land...

29:04.398 --> 29:07.331
...the Crusaders will have
more and more traps for us.

29:07.398 --> 29:08.898
You are right.

29:09.131 --> 29:12.764
Aleppo, Jerusalem,
Damascus, Mosul, Kirkuk...

29:13.431 --> 29:15.564
...and Bagdad... and Konya...

29:15.664 --> 29:19.398
...and so many other cities
are like a mother's children.

29:19.664 --> 29:22.731
Whoever tries to separate them
from each other...

29:22.831 --> 29:24.831
...will pay for it.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.798
You are right.

29:26.897 --> 29:31.298
Aleppo is your home
whenever anything is needed.

29:32.164 --> 29:35.198
Its door is always open
to you and your tent.

29:36.298 --> 29:41.464
And our weapons are always ready
to be pulled out of their sheaths for you.

30:07.131 --> 30:10.431
My girl, we know
what you have gone through.

30:11.564 --> 30:16.898
We all know the troubles
that you have had as a family.

30:17.264 --> 30:20.331
And we know what you had
gone through, Mother Ana.

30:20.598 --> 30:25.531
Being the daughter of a shahzade is not
something I care even a little bit about.

30:25.598 --> 30:29.664
There is nothing I want
other than being a girl in your tent.

30:32.831 --> 30:38.331
Everybody knows very well
what it means to leave your father...

30:38.464 --> 30:42.498
...as the daughter of a shahzade
and come to the tent with a man.

30:46.564 --> 30:49.764
I have asked this to Gokce before.

30:51.631 --> 30:54.264
Now, I will ask you the same.

30:55.331 --> 30:59.164
Are you willing to do anything
for Ertugrul?

31:00.764 --> 31:02.164
Yes.

31:05.498 --> 31:08.398
Do you know that
a women who really loves him...

31:08.464 --> 31:14.631
...should be ready for any trouble
that comes from her pavilion and family?

31:16.231 --> 31:17.564
I do.

31:19.264 --> 31:25.664
Do you know that this girl should only
worry about this pavilion's troubles?

31:27.464 --> 31:29.598
I do, Mother Ana.

31:32.631 --> 31:36.764
So, tell me,
would you disregard your own happiness...

31:37.631 --> 31:40.798
...for the sake of Ertugrul's?

31:42.431 --> 31:46.731
Would you leave Ertugrul and go away?

31:49.164 --> 31:54.864
If I am meant to be together
with Ertugrul, I would be with him.

31:57.398 --> 32:01.531
If am meant to be sad for him,
I would not complain, Mother Ana.

32:07.898 --> 32:11.164
After being educated
in a madrasa in Konya...

32:11.231 --> 32:15.564
...I am trying to help the people of the
tent by Suleyman Shah's request.

32:15.664 --> 32:19.864
Thankfully, the people of the Kayi Tent
serve with heart and soul.

32:21.698 --> 32:24.564
This tent has a different smell, son.

32:25.798 --> 32:28.398
And such a soul that...

32:28.464 --> 32:33.264
...God will create order in the
whole world by favor of them.

32:33.698 --> 32:35.398
Hopefully.

32:35.498 --> 32:36.598
Hopefully.

32:36.698 --> 32:38.664
May I come in?

32:46.131 --> 32:48.731
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

32:56.131 --> 32:57.431
Are you comfortable?

32:57.498 --> 32:59.431
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

32:59.531 --> 33:03.098
Fakih Ilyas welcomes us very well.

33:04.431 --> 33:06.798
I will set off tomorrow
after the Friday prayer.

33:06.864 --> 33:08.231
To where, son?

33:08.331 --> 33:10.298
To save my brother Turgut.

33:11.198 --> 33:14.664
I am going to collapse
the Templars' castle onto them.

33:18.564 --> 33:22.598
The Devil's children
have so many traps to set.

33:24.864 --> 33:28.664
Son, you are young,
your are powerful, you are an Alp...

33:29.098 --> 33:31.298
...however, you must be a ruler.

33:32.164 --> 33:35.331
Pens solve what weapons cannot.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.098
You must see the tricks.

33:38.731 --> 33:42.664
Be careful.
The Devil has lots of tricks.

34:06.464 --> 34:10.664
<i>If I wonder the snowy mountain ahead</i>
 <i>Whose highland is that</i>

34:11.764 --> 34:15.831
<i>If I wonder its cold, cold waters</i>
 <i>Whose spring is that</i>

34:17.131 --> 34:20.731
<i>If I wonder those camels row after row</i>
 <i>Whose load is that</i>

34:22.698 --> 34:27.198
<i>If I wonder the black skied pavilion</i>
 <i>Whose shadow is that</i>

34:27.798 --> 34:31.131
Why are you asking that?

34:32.331 --> 34:35.831
<i>If it gave me news</i>
 <i>About the girl I am meant to be with</i>

34:35.898 --> 34:37.398
I see.

34:38.498 --> 34:41.531
What are you going to do
if it gives you news?

34:43.231 --> 34:46.364
I would say
"I would give my life for you."

34:48.098 --> 34:52.831
Did you remember Cicek Hatun when you saw
Mother Hayme's son in the caravansary?

34:54.764 --> 34:57.331
Do you think I ever forget her?

35:00.264 --> 35:04.098
Did you ask about Cicek Hatun
to Korkut Bey when you saw him?

35:05.698 --> 35:09.098
I did not have the courage, brother.

35:12.298 --> 35:14.498
Your troubles will not end, brother.

35:14.564 --> 35:18.631
Listen, I do not have a woman,
but I gird on my weapons instead.

35:19.364 --> 35:22.498
I do not have children,
but I love my horse instead.

35:22.598 --> 35:27.898
How could we want women
when our people have so many problems?

35:59.598 --> 36:00.598
Sister...

36:00.664 --> 36:01.864
What?

36:03.631 --> 36:07.664
Mother Hayme asked
if I would do anything for Ertugrul.

36:08.464 --> 36:10.098
What does this mean?

36:10.731 --> 36:14.631
She wanted to know if I would stand
anything for the man I love.

36:14.698 --> 36:16.464
Meaning?

36:17.231 --> 36:21.864
She asked if I would love him
to the extent that I would forget him.

36:22.098 --> 36:23.498
And what did you say?

36:27.198 --> 36:29.764
I said that the die was cast.

36:30.698 --> 36:32.498
Well done, sister.

36:32.598 --> 36:34.731
You will never give up.

36:34.798 --> 36:38.098
If you do,
she will oppress you all your life.

36:41.431 --> 36:43.398
Gokce...

36:44.864 --> 36:50.564
Do you think Mother Hayme  wants to marry
her son both you and Halime?

36:51.864 --> 36:53.731
What are you saying, sister?

36:54.864 --> 36:56.464
May I come in?

36:58.631 --> 37:00.231
Please, Bey.

37:07.598 --> 37:08.731
Good day.

37:08.798 --> 37:10.198
Good day, Bey.

37:14.198 --> 37:16.198
I heard that my niece passed away.

37:18.764 --> 37:21.364
Went to his last home.

37:22.098 --> 37:24.431
May him be our savior in the other world.

37:24.498 --> 37:26.098
Amen, Bey.

37:28.898 --> 37:30.531
I am very sorry.

37:31.398 --> 37:33.564
May God grant you other children.

37:34.398 --> 37:37.298
And may Him grant our tent some peace.

37:38.164 --> 37:42.431
Ertugrul Bey, Halime made
quite an entrance to this tent.

37:42.864 --> 37:44.864
We lost so many lives because of her.

37:45.098 --> 37:47.531
So many mothers were devastated.

37:47.631 --> 37:51.664
Aykiz lost Turgut. She lost her mind
and made me lose my baby.

37:52.164 --> 37:54.431
Your brother and me suffered for this.

37:54.764 --> 38:00.164
If more souls will be wounded
because of this girl, do not let this.

38:00.431 --> 38:04.631
Be a man and send her away.

38:05.131 --> 38:08.164
You lost your baby, and you are in pain.

38:08.231 --> 38:12.598
However, this tent has a tradition.

38:14.131 --> 38:18.697
Men act like men,
and women act like women in this tent.

38:20.164 --> 38:25.631
If women interfere with men's business,
there would be no order in the tent.

38:29.531 --> 38:34.731
And I never let a woman
who messes the order say a word.

38:41.631 --> 38:43.098
Have a good day.

38:52.598 --> 38:54.864
I just came to offer my condolence.

38:55.864 --> 38:59.498
Ertugrul, leave off this ambition
for Halime Sultan.

39:00.398 --> 39:03.098
There is no peace in the tent anymore.

39:35.264 --> 39:36.698
Ertugrul Bey...

39:43.098 --> 39:45.531
I am grateful that you came back safe.

39:47.264 --> 39:48.831
Gokce...

39:50.364 --> 39:53.664
You know there is something
regarding the two of us.

39:54.798 --> 39:56.431
My father.

39:57.231 --> 40:00.464
He wants to see you
as his daughter-in-law.

40:01.498 --> 40:06.631
But my heart beats for someone else.

40:12.231 --> 40:15.164
You are my sister
whom I grew up with.

40:15.231 --> 40:17.664
There is nothing beyond this for me.

40:18.098 --> 40:20.431
I just wanted you to know that.

40:22.331 --> 40:23.898
I know, Ertugrul Bey.

40:25.531 --> 40:28.364
Your heart only says "Halime Sultan".

40:31.364 --> 40:35.231
One who waits for the loved one
is bound to be saddened.

40:37.798 --> 40:40.631
I can only accept this saddening now.

40:43.764 --> 40:46.698
I will not come to you
unless you tell me to.

40:46.798 --> 40:49.798
I will wait for you until I die
if necessary.

40:52.631 --> 40:54.398
Do not worry.

40:56.431 --> 40:59.864
This matter is between you
and your father from now on.

41:01.264 --> 41:05.898
Keep in mind that I accepted my fate.

41:11.598 --> 41:13.298
Excuse me.

41:46.298 --> 41:48.364
May I come in, Aykiz?

42:01.098 --> 42:02.698
I heard what happened.

42:04.798 --> 42:07.564
I just wanted to say I am sorry, Aykiz.

42:09.631 --> 42:12.131
Selcan is a dangerous woman.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.664
You can expect anything from her.

42:16.731 --> 42:19.298
You are right, Halime.

42:19.364 --> 42:21.831
Everybody knows she is dangerous.

42:22.831 --> 42:28.531
And there are dangerous people
whom nobody has seen or known of.

42:30.364 --> 42:34.364
The ones that are the main reason
of the troubles we have had.

42:34.864 --> 42:36.731
What do you mean, Aykiz?

42:40.198 --> 42:42.798
Don't you see the situation we are in?

42:44.231 --> 42:47.264
You are responsible for everything.

42:48.798 --> 42:54.631
Don't you ever say yourself "All the
troubles started after we set foot here"?

42:57.464 --> 42:59.598
You are right, Aykiz.

43:01.098 --> 43:06.331
We put you into trouble
while our troubles were still going on...

43:06.398 --> 43:08.698
...but that was not what I wanted.

43:10.498 --> 43:12.698
I made a decision.

43:13.464 --> 43:15.798
I came here leaving my family back.

43:16.298 --> 43:20.664
Halime, you are still
talking about yourself.

43:21.331 --> 43:24.398
My Turgut is a captive
in the Templars' hands.

43:25.598 --> 43:28.331
We do not have any news from him.

43:29.498 --> 43:31.664
While I am in this situation...

43:33.564 --> 43:37.331
...Ertugrul Bey has been chasing you
for the past few days.

43:39.331 --> 43:40.598
May I come in?

43:40.664 --> 43:42.398
Please, Bey.

43:50.098 --> 43:53.398
We will set off to take Turgut
before the sunrise.

43:54.464 --> 43:58.264
And you should know that
we will not come back without him.

44:03.431 --> 44:04.864
If we die...

44:06.531 --> 44:08.698
...give us your blessing, Aykiz.

44:09.698 --> 44:11.431
Of course, Bey.

44:13.498 --> 44:15.898
Give me some information about the castle.

44:16.131 --> 44:17.831
Whenever you want, Bey.

44:21.564 --> 44:23.298
Excuse me.

44:24.264 --> 44:25.764
We will set off.

44:25.864 --> 44:28.464
There are preparations to be made.

44:38.164 --> 44:39.864
I was hating you.

44:42.264 --> 44:45.898
I thought Ertugrul Bey
has forgotten Turgut because of you.

44:46.698 --> 44:50.564
Of course he did not.
A brave man would never forget his Alp.

44:52.664 --> 44:56.331
He will bring Turgut back to you
at the risk of his life.

44:58.464 --> 45:02.331
-Stay in our tent tonight.
-What about your father?

45:02.398 --> 45:04.464
He will take care of himself.

45:05.098 --> 45:08.131
He could lay a bed
by the side of the stove.

45:08.231 --> 45:09.598
Alright.

45:35.731 --> 45:37.298
What did you talk?

45:39.664 --> 45:42.231
He said he loved Halime.

45:45.498 --> 45:47.631
Come here.

45:51.531 --> 45:53.664
Take a walk, sister.

45:59.764 --> 46:02.164
My pure and beautiful Gokce.

46:03.231 --> 46:05.298
Trouble is back in our tent.

46:06.498 --> 46:10.464
Let us see what more troubles
that ominous woman will cause us.

46:13.331 --> 46:16.164
Obviously, she intends to settle in here.

46:16.264 --> 46:21.498
But I know how I will make her go away
without even looking back.

46:22.598 --> 46:26.731
As for you, you will listen to
what I say from now on.

46:27.331 --> 46:29.431
You will do whatever I say.

46:29.498 --> 46:31.564
Otherwise, forget Ertugrul.

46:32.498 --> 46:35.231
Since when are you ruthless so much?

46:36.831 --> 46:39.398
Forget whatever has happened
in the past.

46:39.464 --> 46:43.298
Drop the burden on your shoulders,
and your hatred.

46:43.431 --> 46:46.898
Nobody will love us
as long as you break everybody's heart.

46:47.131 --> 46:49.764
Gokce, behave yourself!
Watch your mouth!

46:51.764 --> 46:53.298
Selcan...

46:54.164 --> 46:55.731
What is it?

46:55.798 --> 46:58.564
You are turning the place upside down.

46:59.564 --> 47:01.231
Nothing, Gundogdu.

47:01.331 --> 47:04.498
My sister was showing me
how impudent she was.

47:08.664 --> 47:13.631
There is enough trouble around.
Do not cause any more troubles here.

47:15.331 --> 47:17.564
Do not worry, Gundogdu.

47:19.564 --> 47:22.131
Bey, Mother Hayma says that...

47:22.231 --> 47:24.898
...Suleyman Shah wants to
have a meal in the pavilion...

47:25.131 --> 47:27.764
...with his children and daughters in law.

47:33.664 --> 47:39.131
ALEPPO

47:50.198 --> 47:51.598
Is Hazrat Ameer in his room?

47:51.664 --> 47:52.864
He is waiting for you.

47:53.098 --> 47:57.198
Thank God we saw you here. We saved
ourselves from being their headquarters.

48:00.398 --> 48:01.764
Thank you, Siddik.

48:26.531 --> 48:27.864
Hazrat Ameer...

48:29.131 --> 48:30.264
Uncle...

48:49.631 --> 48:51.464
Can you forgive me?

48:54.898 --> 48:56.731
All is left behind now.

48:56.798 --> 48:58.364
It is over.

49:00.364 --> 49:03.798
Do not torture yourself
by thinking of the past.

49:04.564 --> 49:07.698
How can I live with this
guilty conscience, Uncle?

49:08.631 --> 49:11.898
With so many people's burden
on my shoulders.

49:13.198 --> 49:15.431
The dervishes that have been martyred...

49:15.498 --> 49:17.631
...the soldiers that have been martyred...

49:17.698 --> 49:21.164
How will I be able to atone for
all these sins?

49:24.831 --> 49:27.531
My sheikh Ibn al Arabi who took over...

49:27.664 --> 49:31.864
...the dervish's coat of Gavs ul Azam
Seyyid Abdulkadir Geylani...

49:32.564 --> 49:34.331
...told me one day:

49:35.631 --> 49:39.831
"Be determined to not commit the sins
you have repented for.

49:41.598 --> 49:47.331
As for the good deeds you are doing, do
them to death, and never give them up"

49:50.798 --> 49:52.564
Welcome.

49:53.431 --> 49:56.264
We will have so much to talk at dinner.

49:59.164 --> 50:00.798
Hopefully, Aziz.

50:02.364 --> 50:04.298
Hopefully.

50:27.698 --> 50:28.864
May I come in?

50:29.764 --> 50:31.631
Yes, come in.

50:35.098 --> 50:38.198
Suleyman Shah invites you
to the family dinner.

50:39.264 --> 50:41.231
Me, too?

50:41.298 --> 50:42.464
Yes.

50:45.898 --> 50:47.831
Would it be appropriate?

50:47.898 --> 50:50.531
Suleyman Shah deemed this suitable.

50:52.464 --> 50:55.264
He said "Ertugrul will go
to bring back Turgut tomorrow.

50:55.331 --> 50:59.631
You never know if he comes back.
Let us be all together in this meal."

51:00.564 --> 51:02.431
He also wanted Wild Demir and Aykiz.

51:02.564 --> 51:04.298
We are coming.

51:11.164 --> 51:12.531
Come on.

51:13.264 --> 51:15.431
The Brave Beys of the Kayi Tent.

51:15.531 --> 51:17.531
You honored my meal.

51:17.631 --> 51:19.231
Thank you all.

51:19.298 --> 51:20.898
You made me so happy.

51:21.131 --> 51:22.264
Thank you.

51:22.331 --> 51:23.698
Thank you.

51:25.898 --> 51:31.164
We have been traveling for so long
to find a land for ourselves.

51:31.231 --> 51:35.331
For our sons and daughters
to be happy.

51:35.398 --> 51:36.631
You are right, Bey.

51:36.698 --> 51:40.664
There is not any piece of land
we have not set foot on.

51:41.364 --> 51:46.264
However, we could not find a land
to live on without any fear.

51:47.731 --> 51:50.664
All our hopes are on Aleppo.

51:50.731 --> 51:54.764
And it is turned to hell
because of Suleyman Shah's son, Ertugrul.

51:54.831 --> 51:57.531
We cannot stand anymore, Kurdoglu.

51:57.631 --> 52:01.264
We found ourselves in baseless fights.

52:02.298 --> 52:04.398
That is what I am worried about.

52:05.298 --> 52:10.164
If it goes on likes this, I am afraid
our children will not be happy anymore.

52:10.231 --> 52:13.131
-You are right, Bey.
-You are right, Bey.

52:13.598 --> 52:15.498
So, what are we going to do?

52:16.264 --> 52:17.864
What is the remedy?

52:18.098 --> 52:22.864
The only man who is experienced enough
to save us from this trouble is you.

52:23.864 --> 52:26.698
Karabudak and Kutlu.

52:26.798 --> 52:30.198
You have always been
brave and direct.

52:30.531 --> 52:32.798
And you still are. Thank you.

52:33.231 --> 52:34.331
Thank you.

52:34.431 --> 52:36.564
I knew I could trust you.

52:37.298 --> 52:38.664
What about the remedy?

52:38.764 --> 52:42.764
The remedy is
going against Suleyman Shah...

52:42.831 --> 52:45.531
...and saying
"The Bey should be Gundogdu".

52:45.598 --> 52:47.364
What?

52:55.364 --> 52:58.164
Alright. Please.

53:23.264 --> 53:28.598
God, give us power
so that the infidels will not succeed.

53:29.898 --> 53:33.464
Strengthen our faith and bodies.

53:34.231 --> 53:36.164
Give us the victory.

53:39.231 --> 53:43.498
Deem the soldiers who have died
in this war as martyrs.

53:44.564 --> 53:47.164
Forgive the sins of El Aziz.

53:48.331 --> 53:49.664
Amen.

54:24.731 --> 54:29.564
Your body will enliven Aleppo,
and your head will enliven the Kayi Tent.

54:31.498 --> 54:35.698
I will show you all
that you are bound to be defeated.

54:52.898 --> 54:55.831
The war is just beginning.

55:50.698 --> 55:52.431
What is wrong with you?

55:52.498 --> 55:54.764
-Nothing.
-What do you mean, nothing?

55:54.864 --> 55:58.364
Do not walk around like that.
Pull yourself together.

56:03.598 --> 56:07.631
These three spoons
that have been left on the table...

56:12.864 --> 56:15.364
So, that was the problem.

56:18.898 --> 56:22.398
One of them is for Ertugrul's
elder brother Sungurtekin...

56:22.464 --> 56:24.564
...and the other is for Dundar.

56:25.264 --> 56:29.564
That is, for the ghosts who will
never be able to sit on this table.

56:30.731 --> 56:32.664
As for the last spoon...

56:32.731 --> 56:36.464
...obviously, you are afraid
that it might be for Halime.

56:40.498 --> 56:42.431
Sister...

56:44.164 --> 56:47.464
Suleyman Shah would not do
such a thing, would he?

56:47.564 --> 56:50.698
Clearly, you haven't known
that old man enough yet.

56:50.798 --> 56:54.898
He can even kill a man
he calls "my friend"...

56:59.264 --> 57:00.898
But not that much.

57:01.164 --> 57:02.764
Look...

57:02.864 --> 57:05.564
...your future husband
will come soon.

57:05.631 --> 57:07.731
We will eat together.

57:07.831 --> 57:09.898
He saved the tent from disasters...

57:10.131 --> 57:12.198
...Aleppo from the Templars...

57:12.264 --> 57:15.564
...and the Islamic world
from a big war.

57:17.131 --> 57:20.564
They sacrificed the biggest ram
in the tent for the sake of him.

57:20.631 --> 57:23.398
Mother Hayme cooked his son's
favorite meal.

57:23.498 --> 57:26.898
This night's king is him,
and the queen is you.

57:27.698 --> 57:29.464
Pull yourself together.

57:37.398 --> 57:38.831
Who else is coming?

57:38.898 --> 57:42.698
Let us see who is going to
come out of your father's bag.

57:44.164 --> 57:45.698
Where is my father?

57:46.331 --> 57:48.831
He is inside, with your mother.

57:48.898 --> 57:50.764
Let me check Dundar out.

57:54.764 --> 57:56.264
Here.

59:02.631 --> 59:04.631
When my brave brother wakes up...

59:04.731 --> 59:07.298
...we will show everybody
in our new land...

59:07.398 --> 59:10.464
...how to shoot arrows
and how to use sword.

59:18.298 --> 59:21.264
Did I do something
to break your heart, brother?

59:22.331 --> 59:24.531
Do not get on me, Ertugrul.

59:24.598 --> 59:26.831
What are you thinking, brother?

59:31.364 --> 59:34.364
You never see Gokce's tears,
do you, Ertugrul?

59:34.464 --> 59:36.764
How she is heartbroken.

59:36.831 --> 59:38.898
You do not care about anything at all.

59:39.131 --> 59:42.598
Neither Gokce
nor this marriage that my father wants...

59:42.698 --> 59:46.631
You always do what you want
and get what you want.

59:46.831 --> 59:48.898
After all, our Bey is very fortunate.

59:49.131 --> 59:52.164
He falls on his four feet
like a Persian cat.

59:52.264 --> 59:54.631
He does not care about the Templars.

59:54.698 --> 59:59.231
Who is my father
who went against the great Seljuks?

00:59:59.898 --> 01:00:02.498
And Gokce who is crazy in love with him?

01:00:02.564 --> 01:00:07.364
Who is she, compared to the
daughter of the Shahzade?

01:00:08.231 --> 01:00:10.564
Only this would suit our Bey.

01:00:12.164 --> 01:00:14.698
Do what suits you, Ertugrul.

01:00:15.264 --> 01:00:17.231
We will see how this will end.

01:00:56.364 --> 01:01:00.198
Aykiz, that is enough.
You are not well. Have a seat.

01:01:00.264 --> 01:01:02.631
I am good. Do not worry.

01:01:05.464 --> 01:01:09.398
I was going to go
to the Templar's castle with them...

01:01:09.464 --> 01:01:12.664
...if Ertugrul Bey allowed me to.

01:01:18.098 --> 01:01:21.164
Is this not the mirror
that Ertugrul gave you?

01:01:21.264 --> 01:01:22.598
Yes.

01:01:22.664 --> 01:01:25.664
Be happy whenever you look at this mirror.

01:01:26.464 --> 01:01:30.198
I hope your happiness increases
whenever you look at it.

01:01:31.131 --> 01:01:32.531
Amin, Aykiz.

01:01:33.331 --> 01:01:35.564
But it will not be easy for you.

01:01:37.231 --> 01:01:41.198
Was it not you who told me once
that being a woman was hard...

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:44.164
...but the hardest is
being an Alp's woman?

01:01:46.564 --> 01:01:49.131
I do not have any place to go anymore.

01:01:51.698 --> 01:01:56.364
I do not have any place to shelter in
other than Ertugrul and your tent.

01:01:59.098 --> 01:02:01.464
I came here leaving my family behind.

01:02:02.564 --> 01:02:05.231
I am not a Shahzade's daughter anymore.

01:02:06.098 --> 01:02:08.231
I am the daughter of this tent.

01:02:08.831 --> 01:02:11.364
May I come in?

01:02:11.464 --> 01:02:13.231
Come in, father.

01:02:18.531 --> 01:02:20.431
Come on, my girl, let us go.

01:02:20.498 --> 01:02:23.164
Father, let me stay here...

01:02:24.664 --> 01:02:27.531
To sit on the same table
with that woman...

01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:30.798
...when the whip wounds
are still on my back.

01:02:30.898 --> 01:02:33.198
There is surely something our Bey knows.

01:02:33.264 --> 01:02:35.898
We will look at each other's faces
all our lives.

01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:38.864
You cannot be angry at each other.
Come on.

01:02:59.264 --> 01:03:00.564
Uncle?

01:03:05.731 --> 01:03:07.298
Uncle?

01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:13.498
Uncle?

01:03:13.564 --> 01:03:15.398
Get up.

01:03:17.664 --> 01:03:19.831
Get up, get up!

01:03:39.298 --> 01:03:40.564
Do not do it, Bey.

01:03:40.631 --> 01:03:42.231
I will see his face.

01:03:42.298 --> 01:03:44.898
They beheaded Atabey.

01:03:45.131 --> 01:03:47.798
Unfortunately, I could not find his head.

01:04:01.298 --> 01:04:02.664
Uncle...

01:04:07.231 --> 01:04:08.531
Uncle, get up.

01:04:10.598 --> 01:04:12.198
Uncle!

01:04:15.331 --> 01:04:16.898
Uncle!

01:04:18.431 --> 01:04:19.764
Uncle, get up.

01:04:21.164 --> 01:04:22.731
Uncle!

01:04:32.922 --> 01:04:34.722
Ertugrul.

01:04:34.855 --> 01:04:36.522
Come here, brother.

01:05:04.522 --> 01:05:06.055
Sit down, sit down.

01:05:06.122 --> 01:05:07.988
Welcome, my children.

01:05:22.922 --> 01:05:26.588
Father, they do not look like
they knew we were coming.

01:05:27.555 --> 01:05:30.855
Mother, you did not say
we would have guests.

01:05:31.522 --> 01:05:33.855
They are not our guests, Selcan.

01:05:33.922 --> 01:05:35.655
They are family.

01:05:37.155 --> 01:05:39.288
Please. Welcome.

01:05:48.555 --> 01:05:49.855
Peace be upon you.

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:52.555
And peace be upon you.

01:06:01.888 --> 01:06:03.722
It is Nowruz time.

01:06:03.788 --> 01:06:07.988
Suleyman Shah told us
to leave all the bad feelings among us.

01:06:08.055 --> 01:06:13.888
We will pray for our new land's
safety and wealth.

01:06:18.988 --> 01:06:20.755
Welcome.

01:06:20.855 --> 01:06:22.555
Sit down, sit down.

01:06:23.088 --> 01:06:24.888
Hayme, sit down.

01:06:31.922 --> 01:06:36.722
Halime Sultan, I am very happy
that you accepted my invitation.

01:06:42.522 --> 01:06:44.588
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.
Please.

01:07:15.588 --> 01:07:17.988
As my late father said...

01:07:18.988 --> 01:07:23.655
...a mountain's side is a road
even though the mountain is very big.

01:07:24.888 --> 01:07:30.288
I remember the day we left
the Toros Mountains to come here.

01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:35.122
I understand that it was not about
coming down the winter range.

01:07:36.055 --> 01:07:42.555
We came to our new land fighting the
Crusaders' plots and losing our soldiers.

01:07:45.288 --> 01:07:48.955
Migrating is never easy.

01:07:49.955 --> 01:07:52.255
It was not easy this time, as well.

01:07:52.722 --> 01:07:57.088
God bless our martyrs and their families.

01:07:57.888 --> 01:08:00.522
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:08:02.922 --> 01:08:05.522
Even my youngest son Dundar...

01:08:05.588 --> 01:08:10.255
...stood out to the Crusaders
and saved our tent from a big disaster.

01:08:10.988 --> 01:08:13.688
He was brave like his elder brothers.

01:08:14.688 --> 01:08:18.888
Hopefully, we will see him as well
on this table.

01:08:18.988 --> 01:08:20.155
-Hopefully.
-Hopefully.

01:08:20.222 --> 01:08:22.088
Hopefully.

01:08:23.722 --> 01:08:29.588
Not everything will be a bed of roses
in this land, of course.

01:08:31.255 --> 01:08:34.855
We will always struggle
to be able to stay here.

01:08:34.922 --> 01:08:40.055
I will give important duties
to Gundogdu and Ertugrul for this.

01:08:42.688 --> 01:08:44.955
Both of them showed that...

01:08:45.055 --> 01:08:49.855
...they are candidates to be
the Bey of this tent in the future.

01:08:49.955 --> 01:08:56.022
I would like our tent to know
Suleyman Shah's sons better.

01:08:59.022 --> 01:09:04.055
The one who deserves better would be
the Bey of our tent when the time comes.

01:09:07.722 --> 01:09:12.588
From now on, Gundogdu
will deal with our tent's livelihood.

01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:16.288
The sales of our animals...

01:09:16.555 --> 01:09:19.188
...the sales of our goods
in other cities...

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:24.622
It is a difficult duty in which
he has to struggle thousands of thugs.

01:09:27.188 --> 01:09:32.188
Obviously, they will give us
a hard time in our new land.

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:36.222
Ertugrul will be ready at all times
with his Alps...

01:09:36.288 --> 01:09:40.722
...to protect our tent
against the Crusaders' attacks.

01:09:42.022 --> 01:09:46.788
By God's will, he will take Turgut
and bring him back here tomorrow.

01:09:46.888 --> 01:09:49.688
Hopefully, Bey. Hopefully.

01:09:55.622 --> 01:10:02.322
I appreciate my sons one more time
who brought our tent a victory.

01:10:03.255 --> 01:10:05.188
We are all grateful to them.

01:10:05.255 --> 01:10:07.922
-Thank you, father.
-Thank you, father.

01:10:37.888 --> 01:10:39.555
Halime Sultan...

01:10:40.922 --> 01:10:44.055
It was very grueling for you.

01:10:44.122 --> 01:10:47.522
Thankfully, you are healthy.

01:10:48.022 --> 01:10:51.522
However, people who wish to use you...

01:10:51.755 --> 01:10:56.888
...and the shahzades will always exist.

01:11:00.155 --> 01:11:04.022
Suleyman Shah, if you see fit...

01:11:04.122 --> 01:11:07.588
...I do not wish to be my father's
daughter who betrayed his country...

01:11:07.655 --> 01:11:10.222
...I wish to be this tent's daughter.

01:11:13.555 --> 01:11:17.722
To get older together with the
brave people whom I see as my family.

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:29.055
You will make us very happy if you attend
Ertugrul Bey and Gokce's wedding.

01:11:49.755 --> 01:11:51.922
Suleyman Shah, may I come in?

01:11:53.955 --> 01:11:55.855
Bey...

01:11:55.922 --> 01:11:58.688
Afsin Bey and Shahzade Yigit are here.

01:11:59.155 --> 01:12:00.155
Yigit...

01:12:00.222 --> 01:12:03.322
Let them in.
We have room for them on our table.

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:09.222
Father, as I told you before
about Afsin Bey...

01:12:09.288 --> 01:12:11.088
Let us listen, son.

01:12:20.722 --> 01:12:22.522
Sister!

01:12:24.322 --> 01:12:25.788
Welcome.

01:12:29.955 --> 01:12:31.888
How dare you come here Afsin Bey?

01:12:31.955 --> 01:12:33.622
Ertugrul!

01:12:38.122 --> 01:12:42.522
I came here to let you know that
I did my last duty to the shahzades.

01:12:45.622 --> 01:12:47.855
Where is my father, Afsin Bey?

01:12:52.122 --> 01:12:53.222
Is he alright?

01:12:53.288 --> 01:12:58.755
Shahzade Numan. The state
does not forgive the one who betrays it.

01:13:00.688 --> 01:13:02.788
Your father...

01:13:05.688 --> 01:13:07.988
...passed away, Halime Sultan.

01:13:10.522 --> 01:13:13.088
I buried him myself.

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:14.955
I did my last duty.

01:13:52.722 --> 01:13:53.988
Halime...

01:13:55.988 --> 01:13:58.555
How did it happen, Afsin Bey?

01:13:58.922 --> 01:14:03.022
The Seljuq Empire did
what was necessary Ertugrul Bey.

01:14:28.522 --> 01:14:30.122
Halime...

01:14:38.522 --> 01:14:40.788
Halime... I...

01:14:40.855 --> 01:14:44.288
He was my father
even though he betrayed his country.

01:14:50.222 --> 01:14:53.588
We scattered our lives
into pieces for him.

01:14:57.522 --> 01:15:01.855
We had all kinds of torture with my
brother while we were running away.

01:15:03.588 --> 01:15:04.955
We always resisted.

01:15:06.755 --> 01:15:09.055
Even that little boy resisted.

01:15:15.622 --> 01:15:18.588
But my father was weak.

01:15:25.122 --> 01:15:27.522
Maybe he wanted to protect us.

01:15:27.622 --> 01:15:29.155
I do not know.

01:15:33.922 --> 01:15:37.088
And I will never know, anyway.

01:15:37.155 --> 01:15:40.088
He is gone now.

01:15:44.955 --> 01:15:49.988
But I will remember him
with his courage while he was...

01:15:51.622 --> 01:15:57.588
...running away from the people
who used him to establish the state.

01:16:03.522 --> 01:16:05.288
He was our father.

01:16:07.822 --> 01:16:10.988
With his sins and good deeds.

01:16:23.022 --> 01:16:25.188
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

01:16:27.055 --> 01:16:31.922
We would like to read Quran for my father
with Yigit if you allow us to.

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:35.022
God forgive his sins, Halime.

01:16:36.922 --> 01:16:38.288
I am sorry.

01:16:38.522 --> 01:16:39.788
Amen.

01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:23.722
Yigit.

01:17:24.888 --> 01:17:28.288
Wild Demir is building a tent for us.
I am taking a bed.

01:17:33.622 --> 01:17:35.855
How is Halime Sultan?

01:17:40.988 --> 01:17:43.588
Are going to go to save Turgut?

01:17:45.522 --> 01:17:46.988
Hopefully, Yigit.

01:17:47.055 --> 01:17:51.588
They caused so much pain.
Make them pay, Ertugrul Bey.

01:18:18.788 --> 01:18:20.555
May I come in?

01:18:20.622 --> 01:18:22.622
Come in, Ertugrul Bey.

01:18:29.555 --> 01:18:31.755
May God speed you.

01:18:31.822 --> 01:18:36.055
You should know that I will not
come back without him if he is alive.

01:18:37.222 --> 01:18:42.988
I also know that you will not come back
without a revenge if he is martyred.

01:18:55.155 --> 01:18:56.855
I am sorry.

01:18:57.555 --> 01:18:59.222
Thank you, Ertugrul.

01:19:01.822 --> 01:19:03.922
May God forgive his sins.

01:19:06.888 --> 01:19:10.655
Do not make me grieve for you, too
after my father, Ertugrul.

01:19:15.588 --> 01:19:19.655
Do you remember what I told you
when I first separated from you?

01:19:22.121 --> 01:19:24.022
"May God speed you.

01:19:26.655 --> 01:19:28.988
May the Sun not burn your skin.

01:19:30.088 --> 01:19:32.522
May the rain not make you cold.

01:19:33.988 --> 01:19:36.522
May stones stay away from your feet.

01:19:38.022 --> 01:19:41.655
Go like water, and come back like water."

01:19:42.755 --> 01:19:47.888
Aktolgali will fly me like a bird,
and bring back within a short time, then.

01:20:46.988 --> 01:20:50.588
-I heard that you were going for Turgut.
-Why do you care?

01:20:50.688 --> 01:20:54.055
It is me who knows the castle best.
Let me come with you.

01:20:54.888 --> 01:20:59.055
I learned what was necessary
from Aykiz and my brother's Alp.

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:05.655
I will not have any business with the man
who cooperated with the killer of my Alps.

01:22:29.822 --> 01:22:31.922
I brought a message from Kurdoglu.

01:22:31.988 --> 01:22:33.788
Talk!

01:22:35.255 --> 01:22:36.822
Talk, man!

01:22:36.888 --> 01:22:39.655
Is he going to come?

01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:43.088
Yes, he will.
But I did not come here to tell that.

01:22:43.155 --> 01:22:44.688
Why did you come, then?

01:22:44.788 --> 01:22:48.922
The two men you are after...
Both of them are guests in our tent.

01:22:48.988 --> 01:22:50.788
Who are they?

01:22:50.855 --> 01:22:53.822
Shahzade Yigit and a dervish named Arabi.

01:22:54.988 --> 01:22:59.155
Kurdoglu asked me to tell you that
a guest is going to come, as well.

01:22:59.255 --> 01:23:00.922
Who?

01:23:01.088 --> 01:23:02.522
Ertugrul.

01:24:17.322 --> 01:24:19.322
Precious Muslims...

01:24:19.588 --> 01:24:23.055
...God Almighty says
in Surah An-Nisa...

01:24:23.155 --> 01:24:28.222
"Whoever obeys God and the Lord,
will be companions of the Nabis...

01:24:28.322 --> 01:24:33.022
...the loyal ones, the martyrs
and the rightly guided ones...

01:24:33.122 --> 01:24:36.155
...whom Allah has blessed.

01:24:37.088 --> 01:24:39.922
And excellent companions they are."

01:24:40.055 --> 01:24:43.322
The most important quality
of a Muslim is loyalty.

01:24:43.588 --> 01:24:45.188
What is loyalty?

01:24:45.688 --> 01:24:47.888
To be righteous at all times.

01:24:47.988 --> 01:24:51.155
To say the truth when you talk.

01:24:51.255 --> 01:24:53.588
To go the right way.

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:58.788
Loyalty is the strongest way
to reach God.

01:24:59.988 --> 01:25:03.822
Righteous people
are the true travelers of this way.

01:25:07.688 --> 01:25:09.755
Precious Muslims...

01:25:10.155 --> 01:25:14.822
The most important secret that has
protected Hazrat Noah from the flood...

01:25:14.988 --> 01:25:17.255
...Hazrat Yusuf from the well...

01:25:17.322 --> 01:25:23.922
...and our Prophet from the infidels
was that they were loyals.

01:25:28.188 --> 01:25:30.288
May God let us be the righteous ones.

01:25:30.522 --> 01:25:31.822
Amen.

01:25:31.888 --> 01:25:37.655
And protect us from the ones
who set traps at all times.

01:25:38.522 --> 01:25:39.955
Amen.

01:25:42.055 --> 01:25:43.722
Amen.

01:28:05.088 --> 01:28:07.888
Now look at me and repeat after me.

01:28:11.322 --> 01:28:14.122
Uccello.

01:28:14.588 --> 01:28:18.088
Uc... cell...

01:28:18.655 --> 01:28:19.988
...cillo.

01:28:21.322 --> 01:28:22.822
Uccello.

01:28:22.922 --> 01:28:24.288
Bird.

01:28:25.722 --> 01:28:29.322
{\an8}A very beautiful bird.

01:28:31.288 --> 01:28:32.788
Wonderful.

01:28:34.222 --> 01:28:41.088
It is you who is wonderful
and "molto bello".

01:28:45.655 --> 01:28:50.622
If you go to Genova one day, all the girls
will be dying to talk to you.

01:28:52.555 --> 01:28:54.755
You are so beautiful.

01:29:02.188 --> 01:29:07.155
I would never think of
talking to another girl.

01:29:09.522 --> 01:29:11.922
Never forget where you came from.

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:22.088
I am...

01:29:23.055 --> 01:29:24.222
...Judas.

01:29:28.322 --> 01:29:30.855
Never forget where you came from.

01:29:32.955 --> 01:29:34.688
I am..

01:29:35.822 --> 01:29:37.255
...Judas.

01:29:57.288 --> 01:30:00.988
I would say you were a mother
to the rebirth of Judas, but...

01:30:03.088 --> 01:30:06.522
...you look like his lover,
instead of his mother.

01:30:07.055 --> 01:30:12.055
It is you who sleeps with everybody
by order of my uncle. I am not you.

01:30:21.288 --> 01:30:23.022
Women.

01:30:26.255 --> 01:30:27.822
Judas.

01:30:34.522 --> 01:30:36.555
One day...

01:30:37.822 --> 01:30:41.888
...just like Judas
who brought Jesus to the crucifix...

01:30:41.988 --> 01:30:45.122
...you will pound the nails
on Ertugrul's body.

01:30:47.155 --> 01:30:49.055
This is your fate.

01:30:49.588 --> 01:30:52.588
My... fate.

01:31:06.322 --> 01:31:08.688
{\an8}Stupid bird.

01:31:58.322 --> 01:32:01.288
-Give me your blessing, father.
-My blessing is yours.

01:32:01.522 --> 01:32:03.955
-Give me your blessings.
-It is yours.

01:32:05.755 --> 01:32:07.955
Bey, they sent this from Aleppo.

01:32:08.822 --> 01:32:12.022
The carrier said
this is a present from Sehabettin.

01:32:13.222 --> 01:32:14.822
Open the chest.

01:32:39.322 --> 01:32:42.055
May my sword be drenched in my blood...

01:32:42.122 --> 01:32:45.655
...unless I make your life unbearable...

01:32:45.755 --> 01:32:49.722
...and unless I burn you
in the hellfire in this world.

01:32:54.688 --> 01:32:55.822
Give me your blessings.

01:32:55.922 --> 01:32:57.288
It is yours.

01:35:46.822 --> 01:35:48.555
Do you have a death wish?

01:35:48.622 --> 01:35:50.122
I told you not to come.

01:35:50.922 --> 01:35:54.055
You do not think of
entering the castle, do you?

01:35:56.755 --> 01:36:00.555
You want to save Turgut,
but you do not know how to do it.

01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:05.322
Will you let me come with you
if I tell you how to do it?

01:36:07.988 --> 01:36:09.555
How?

01:36:11.022 --> 01:36:12.755
Cardinal Thomas.

01:36:41.221 --> 01:36:42.655
Tatos Harput?

01:36:42.721 --> 01:36:44.288
His very self.

01:36:44.522 --> 01:36:45.855
And who are you?

01:36:45.955 --> 01:36:47.688
Gundogdu.

01:36:47.755 --> 01:36:50.855
You are from the Kayis.
What was his name...

01:36:50.922 --> 01:36:52.255
Kurdoglu.

01:36:53.922 --> 01:36:55.788
You are his niece.

01:36:58.022 --> 01:37:00.755
We can go and see the flock if you want.

01:37:00.822 --> 01:37:02.188
Of course I do.

01:37:02.255 --> 01:37:05.922
However, I would like to know
the man I will trade with better.

01:37:06.022 --> 01:37:08.688
What would you like to know, Gundogdu?

01:37:09.155 --> 01:37:12.722
For example, if you are
one of those low-down Templars.

01:37:30.622 --> 01:37:32.588
I like you, son.

01:37:33.955 --> 01:37:37.255
I like you better after this question.

01:37:37.755 --> 01:37:39.988
Sit down, sit down.

01:37:42.722 --> 01:37:44.522
Would you like some soup?

01:37:44.622 --> 01:37:46.988
It is Harput's famous soup.

01:37:47.922 --> 01:37:49.722
Alright, I would.

01:37:49.822 --> 01:37:52.122
It would warm us inside.

01:37:52.188 --> 01:37:54.055
Give some soup to the Bey.

01:38:07.155 --> 01:38:09.222
Templars?

01:38:09.988 --> 01:38:15.088
As an Orthodox,
I can only hate the Templars.

01:38:15.988 --> 01:38:21.988
A hatred so much that, your hatred as a
Muslim would be pale in comparison.

01:38:22.988 --> 01:38:26.288
That is good.
I am glad we have some common ground.

01:38:26.855 --> 01:38:28.188
Me too, son.

01:38:29.122 --> 01:38:31.688
We can talk business, then.

01:38:55.888 --> 01:39:01.722
They would not settle behind those
big walls if they were brave men.

01:39:03.688 --> 01:39:05.988
Not everybody is as brave as we are.

01:39:06.155 --> 01:39:08.788
Can they make the sky a shield,
and the earth a weapon?

01:39:08.855 --> 01:39:12.722
We will crush their heads
with those big stones.

01:39:16.088 --> 01:39:20.288
Many Templar bases like this castle
control the whole Mediterranean.

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:24.655
They would test even the Pope
for their own profit.

01:39:26.222 --> 01:39:30.055
The Cardinal is the man
whom they want to be the Pope.

01:39:32.088 --> 01:39:34.955
The infidels are everywhere,
Uncle Afsin.

01:39:35.055 --> 01:39:39.588
In the tent, in our pavilion,
in the palace.

01:39:39.655 --> 01:39:42.888
And the Islamic World is disunited.

01:39:42.988 --> 01:39:45.155
We do not even have a conqueror state.

01:39:45.255 --> 01:39:48.088
Nothing is like it seems, Ertugrul Bey.

01:39:48.155 --> 01:39:50.655
The black clouds gathering above us...

01:39:50.755 --> 01:39:53.088
...are for the rain to pour over us.

01:39:55.088 --> 01:39:58.555
Our states will survive forever.

01:39:58.622 --> 01:40:02.788
Our state becomes Oghuz
and bursts out to the world.

01:40:03.555 --> 01:40:07.722
The next thing you know,
it becomes Gokturk and makes stones talk.

01:40:08.255 --> 01:40:13.188
Then it becomes the double-headed eagle
and gives life to the great Seljuk.

01:40:14.188 --> 01:40:15.955
What I am saying is that...

01:40:16.022 --> 01:40:19.322
...Turks will never live
without call to prayer...

01:40:19.555 --> 01:40:22.022
...a flag and a state, Ertugrul Bey.

01:40:26.722 --> 01:40:28.888
Once we take that Cardinal...

01:40:30.888 --> 01:40:33.622
...we will talk about the state
with you.

01:40:34.855 --> 01:40:36.255
Help me!

01:40:46.922 --> 01:40:48.622
Help me!

01:40:49.322 --> 01:40:50.788
Help me!

01:40:51.822 --> 01:40:53.722
Help me!

01:40:56.022 --> 01:40:58.188
Help me!

01:41:00.088 --> 01:41:01.822
Brother Abdurrahman!

01:41:53.555 --> 01:41:55.555
Abdurrahman, what happened?

01:41:55.788 --> 01:41:57.155
Suleyman Shah...

01:41:59.622 --> 01:42:01.655
...has sent us here, secretly.

01:42:02.655 --> 01:42:04.688
We were trapped.

01:42:04.788 --> 01:42:06.988
Two of our Alps have been martyred.

01:42:09.188 --> 01:42:13.555
I have been watching here
for days without any food and water.

01:42:24.755 --> 01:42:26.522
Rest in peace.

01:42:26.988 --> 01:42:28.155
Amen.

01:42:29.555 --> 01:42:32.088
Tell me, how did this happen?

01:43:02.022 --> 01:43:04.155
Did you do your duty, Titus?

01:43:05.188 --> 01:43:06.555
Yes, sir.

01:43:21.155 --> 01:43:24.955
Are you upset because
you lost our organization in Aleppo?

01:43:26.322 --> 01:43:28.555
Maybe a little.

01:43:29.122 --> 01:43:32.022
Because of what El Aziz caused.

01:43:32.722 --> 01:43:39.155
Our knight that will replace Sehabettin
will make us stronger than before.

01:43:41.022 --> 01:43:43.722
It is not only about Aleppo.

01:43:43.822 --> 01:43:45.888
Bran Shefoth from Bordeux...

01:43:47.055 --> 01:43:49.855
...Aman from Provence...

01:43:49.922 --> 01:43:52.222
...Toroya from Aragon...

01:43:52.322 --> 01:43:56.022
...and last of all, Montegu.

01:43:57.322 --> 01:44:00.855
I would prefer dying
instead of being unsuccessful...

01:44:00.988 --> 01:44:06.888
...against the great memories
of these great masters.

01:44:08.922 --> 01:44:11.222
We will not allow this, sir.

01:44:13.188 --> 01:44:16.955
You are the Grand Master of Antioch.

01:44:18.855 --> 01:44:23.188
When we have Jerusalem,
and we will...

01:44:24.955 --> 01:44:27.655
...your name will be scraped in hearts.

01:44:27.722 --> 01:44:31.222
Let us see if our guests
will say the same thing.

01:44:33.255 --> 01:44:34.988
Who is coming, sir?

01:44:35.088 --> 01:44:38.322
The commanders of
Jerusalem, Akka and Tripoli.

01:44:40.022 --> 01:44:44.055
They are coming
by order of Grand Master Montegu.

01:44:45.122 --> 01:44:49.588
We cannot stand
any more failures, Titus.

01:44:51.222 --> 01:44:54.588
From now on, we must be harsher...

01:44:54.988 --> 01:44:57.122
...more reckless...

01:44:57.188 --> 01:45:01.222
...and at least as brutal as
those barbarians.

01:45:02.722 --> 01:45:04.222
Do you understand me?

01:45:05.822 --> 01:45:10.822
By the way, everybody we look for
comes to us by himself.

01:45:15.722 --> 01:45:18.822
Sir...

01:45:30.355 --> 01:45:32.189
Come in.

01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:56.455
Jasmine.

01:45:57.522 --> 01:45:59.155
My favorite odor.

01:46:00.289 --> 01:46:02.355
What do you want, Eftelya?

01:46:13.455 --> 01:46:15.789
I want to be forgiven, Cardinal.

01:46:17.455 --> 01:46:20.022
To be purified from my sins.

01:46:21.122 --> 01:46:25.322
Sometimes our sins
are our medals of honor, Eftelya.

01:46:26.122 --> 01:46:29.222
We carry them proudly.

01:47:16.355 --> 01:47:19.522
If you want to read the letter
I wrote to the Pope...

01:47:19.589 --> 01:47:22.722
-...I will scratch your eyes out, bitch!
-No!

01:47:23.022 --> 01:47:24.655
What do you want?

01:47:32.589 --> 01:47:34.455
Just...

01:47:39.089 --> 01:47:40.755
...some mercy.

01:48:16.222 --> 01:48:22.122
She said, "If I am meant to be
with him, I will live it.

01:48:26.255 --> 01:48:29.755
If I am meant to be unhappy,
I will accept it."

01:48:32.355 --> 01:48:34.122
Is that so?

01:48:35.622 --> 01:48:40.755
Sometimes I cannot help thinking that I am
casting a shadow upon my son's happiness.

01:48:41.755 --> 01:48:45.422
It is clear that
they both love each other.

01:48:46.622 --> 01:48:48.222
However...

01:48:48.322 --> 01:48:54.222
However, you would not
break your promise, would you?

01:48:55.422 --> 01:48:57.589
You know me. I would not.

01:48:59.089 --> 01:49:03.089
But if someone from their side does,
it is a different story.

01:49:06.422 --> 01:49:07.455
Bey!

01:49:07.522 --> 01:49:09.422
Bey, are you alright?

01:49:12.155 --> 01:49:17.222
I think this boil starts to relapse.
I could not stand this pain one more time.

01:49:17.322 --> 01:49:19.389
There was some ointment left there.

01:49:19.455 --> 01:49:22.089
Wait. Never mind.

01:49:25.155 --> 01:49:26.422
Are you alright?

01:49:27.622 --> 01:49:30.622
I sent Abdurrahman and his Alps
to the castle.

01:49:30.689 --> 01:49:32.255
Still no news.

01:49:33.055 --> 01:49:35.289
I hope nothing bad has happened.

01:49:35.755 --> 01:49:38.989
Bey, please do not
think about these things.

01:49:43.455 --> 01:49:45.522
You are alright, are you not?

01:49:46.622 --> 01:49:48.555
I am. I am.

01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:13.389
I will pray for you
to come back from Antioch fast, Cardinal.

01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:18.122
And I will do everything I can
for your prayers to come true, Eftelya.

01:51:22.389 --> 01:51:24.989
What am I doing in this ominous place?

01:51:27.255 --> 01:51:28.455
Damn!

01:51:28.522 --> 01:51:30.122
Damn you!

01:51:35.155 --> 01:51:36.789
Wait, I will be back.

01:53:56.989 --> 01:53:58.555
Who are you?

01:53:58.622 --> 01:54:02.089
Ertugrul, the son of Suleyman Shah
from the Kayi Tent.

01:54:05.022 --> 01:54:08.289
You gained Aleppo.
You gained the Taurus Mountains.

01:54:08.355 --> 01:54:11.455
Do you want to be
a Crusader count, Ertugrul?

01:54:12.522 --> 01:54:16.289
Do not worry, we do not have
our eyes on your land, priest.

01:54:17.089 --> 01:54:18.589
Cardinal.

01:54:18.689 --> 01:54:21.255
Cardinal Thomas.

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:25.322
I know very well who you are.

01:54:27.155 --> 01:54:29.122
You are committing a big sin, son.

01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:33.989
I am a reverend who is at God's service.

01:54:35.389 --> 01:54:39.189
A Turk like you
should not do such a thing.

01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:43.255
You will only be my guest
until I get what I want.

01:55:04.722 --> 01:55:07.122
Come on, are you not going to tell?

01:55:08.255 --> 01:55:10.289
May I come in?

01:55:10.355 --> 01:55:12.122
Come in, uncle.

01:55:17.555 --> 01:55:19.055
Good day.

01:55:19.722 --> 01:55:21.155
Thank you.

01:55:21.989 --> 01:55:24.455
I missed sister Selcan's food.

01:55:25.789 --> 01:55:29.555
You can always have our food
if you be a good uncle.

01:55:30.489 --> 01:55:32.755
Okay, enjoy your meal.

01:55:33.022 --> 01:55:36.122
So, tell me, good niece.

01:55:36.222 --> 01:55:38.555
What did you talk with Tatos Harput?

01:55:39.322 --> 01:55:42.055
I took the cattle to him.
He liked the flock.

01:55:42.122 --> 01:55:45.489
He found them a bit skinny
but he thinks he can sell them.

01:55:45.555 --> 01:55:47.789
We made a deal with a good price.

01:55:48.022 --> 01:55:49.055
Good.

01:55:49.122 --> 01:55:51.022
Our people will be very happy.

01:55:51.122 --> 01:55:54.122
Your reputation in the tent
will increase.

01:55:54.189 --> 01:55:57.789
-However, he will sell them to...
-Why should we care?

01:55:58.589 --> 01:56:03.289
He could throw them into the sea
as long as he pays the money.

01:56:03.355 --> 01:56:04.455
Uncle...

01:56:04.555 --> 01:56:06.555
He will take them to Antioch.

01:56:06.622 --> 01:56:09.322
To the Crusader earldom.
His customers are there.

01:56:09.389 --> 01:56:10.989
So what, Gundogdu?

01:56:12.089 --> 01:56:14.789
Do not talk like
you do not know my father.

01:56:17.222 --> 01:56:21.389
If you can convince your old man
the tent will be in welfare.

01:56:21.455 --> 01:56:23.755
If there is welfare, there is also peace.

01:56:24.022 --> 01:56:27.655
Whoever brings peace to this tent...

01:56:27.755 --> 01:56:30.655
...he is the one
who deserves to be the Bey.

01:56:34.555 --> 01:56:35.755
Thank you.

01:57:10.055 --> 01:57:11.622
Afsin?

01:57:14.789 --> 01:57:16.255
So, it is you.

01:57:19.555 --> 01:57:22.355
Here we meet again
after all those years.

01:57:22.722 --> 01:57:25.089
Not after all those years, Thomas.

01:57:25.689 --> 01:57:28.055
I was in the castle months ago.

01:57:29.022 --> 01:57:30.422
So, that monk was you.

01:57:30.522 --> 01:57:32.589
Well done, Thomas. Good guess.

01:57:33.289 --> 01:57:36.055
You came to the castle to take Turgut.

01:57:36.122 --> 01:57:38.422
And now you took me captive.

01:57:38.522 --> 01:57:41.022
So, you will trade us.

01:57:41.722 --> 01:57:43.489
Well done again, Thomas.

01:57:45.255 --> 01:57:48.422
We knew you went to Antioch
every Sunday.

01:57:48.989 --> 01:57:52.122
We decided to take advantage of this.
Good idea?

01:57:56.755 --> 01:57:58.722
What can I for you?

01:58:01.055 --> 01:58:03.555
You can start with
giving me your cross.

01:58:16.055 --> 01:58:19.689
What if Master Petruchio
does not want to give Turgut to you?

01:58:23.689 --> 01:58:26.422
We will take Turgut Alp
one way or the other.

01:58:26.489 --> 01:58:31.989
But I do not know
if they can take you from me.

01:58:43.355 --> 01:58:45.389
Tie that black priest up.

01:58:45.455 --> 01:58:48.222
Take Abdurrahman with you
and go to the tent.

01:58:48.289 --> 01:58:50.289
Tell my father what happened.

01:58:59.489 --> 01:59:01.055
Him?

01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:05.655
Send him to the castle
and we finish our business before sunset.

01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:08.689
Stand up.

02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:31.289
They only saved me, sir.

02:00:31.355 --> 02:00:32.622
What do they want?

02:00:32.722 --> 02:00:35.622
They want Titus
to bring Turgut Alp to them.

02:00:38.155 --> 02:00:42.055
Turgut Alp for the Cardinal.

02:00:42.155 --> 02:00:43.555
Yes, sir.

02:01:10.455 --> 02:01:12.255
Is it true, sir?

02:01:13.155 --> 02:01:18.489
On the one hand,
I see the Devil grinning mischievously.

02:01:19.489 --> 02:01:24.622
He says, "Let that ominous Turk
kill Thomas."

02:01:27.689 --> 02:01:33.455
On the other hand, the Angel says...

02:01:34.622 --> 02:01:37.622
..."Let Turgut do what is necessary."

02:01:39.155 --> 02:01:43.589
Do you think I should listen the Angel...

02:01:43.655 --> 02:01:45.722
...or the Devil?

02:02:03.522 --> 02:02:10.522
{\an8}TRADING DAY

02:02:48.789 --> 02:02:51.122
So we meet again, Turk.

02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:53.122
Since I promised you...

02:02:53.222 --> 02:02:55.422
...and as far as I see,
you kept your promise...

02:02:55.489 --> 02:02:58.189
...you can take this black priest and go.

02:02:58.589 --> 02:03:03.355
But next time, one of us will die, Titus.

02:03:06.122 --> 02:03:09.155
Sometimes I think about
how similar we are.

02:03:09.989 --> 02:03:12.022
Both of us are stubborn.

02:03:12.089 --> 02:03:13.455
We never give up.

02:03:15.389 --> 02:03:19.989
Both of us fight for our
sacred values, our big family.

02:03:22.255 --> 02:03:26.289
Both of us lost our best warriors
because of each other.

02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:32.022
Both of us are the killer of our brothers.

02:03:35.422 --> 02:03:37.289
You may be right, Titus.

02:03:38.155 --> 02:03:40.255
But not about being killers.

02:03:41.722 --> 02:03:47.389
Your brother Bisol died fighting me
honorably, with his weapon in his hand.

02:03:49.089 --> 02:03:53.989
However, you attacked
an innocent child viciously.

02:03:57.022 --> 02:03:58.589
Dundar is still alive.

02:04:01.722 --> 02:04:04.989
However, my brother
has not opened his eyes.

02:04:05.089 --> 02:04:09.389
But I know it very well that
he will come back to us...

02:04:11.055 --> 02:04:13.055
...the day I kill you.

02:04:14.755 --> 02:04:18.155
And you will die ingloriously.

02:04:20.555 --> 02:04:25.155
You will die in pain because you could not
take your brother's revenge.

02:04:28.122 --> 02:04:30.622
Take the bag on Turgut Alp's head off.

02:04:46.055 --> 02:04:47.789
Untie the Cardinal.

02:05:18.322 --> 02:05:19.989
Send Turgut Alp.

02:05:56.389 --> 02:05:59.122
Untie the Alp's hands
after we are gone.

02:06:18.422 --> 02:06:23.422
I am looking forward to the day
we will meet lastly.

02:07:29.055 --> 02:07:33.122
{\an8}And fight them until
oppression is lifted from the believers...

02:07:33.222 --> 02:07:36.455
{\an8}...and the Religion becomes clearly
apparent and acknowledged.

02:07:36.522 --> 02:07:39.189
{\an8}If they abandon
(oppression and prevention)...

02:07:39.255 --> 02:07:41.789
{\an8}...certainly God is <i>Basir</i>
over what they do.

02:08:20.422 --> 02:08:21.755
Halime?

02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:35.155
Ertugrul!

02:09:08.155 --> 02:09:09.555
Why?

02:09:30.355 --> 02:09:32.522
Why did you do this, Turgut?
