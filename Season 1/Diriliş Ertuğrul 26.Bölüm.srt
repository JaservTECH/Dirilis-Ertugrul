12:24.025 --> 12:27.025
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:29.084 --> 12:32.084
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:34.741 --> 12:37.741
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:50.088 --> 12:51.488
You pander!

12:52.621 --> 12:54.188
I will kill you.

12:55.821 --> 12:57.488
What did you want from my wife?

13:05.721 --> 13:07.888
Unfortunately, I got you without
your weapon.

13:09.254 --> 13:11.154
I have never imagined like that.

13:14.488 --> 13:16.821
It should not have been this easy,
Gundogdu.

13:42.388 --> 13:43.654
Come on!

13:44.854 --> 13:49.388
Gundogdu Bey! Give a holler!

13:49.488 --> 13:50.821
I am here!

14:02.388 --> 14:03.754
I will be back Gundogdu!

14:06.088 --> 14:09.821
I will never give up until your kin is
nonexistent! Know it!

14:19.288 --> 14:20.788
Gundogdu!

14:22.888 --> 14:24.588
Gundogdu!

14:26.321 --> 14:28.454
Gundogdu!

14:31.521 --> 14:33.088
Have you forgiven me?

14:33.888 --> 14:37.854
Before I die, tell me that you have
forgiven me. Forgive me.

14:39.154 --> 14:40.421
Hatun.

14:40.788 --> 14:41.854
Selcan.

14:42.088 --> 14:44.521
For God's sake. God forbids.

14:44.688 --> 14:47.421
How can it be? Open your eyes! Selcan!

14:47.488 --> 14:49.754
Open your eyes for me! For God's sake.
For our baby.

14:51.854 --> 14:53.588
Bey. Selcan Hatun.

15:01.321 --> 15:04.354
Go, tell the healer. One of you,
go tell the healer, right now!

15:04.788 --> 15:06.521
Come on, hurry up!

15:37.488 --> 15:39.488
Hold on Selcan.

15:40.521 --> 15:41.554
Hold on Hatun.

15:41.821 --> 15:44.621
Hold on for me, hold on for our baby...

15:45.154 --> 15:46.454
...hold on Selcan.

15:47.754 --> 15:49.854
Hurry! Hurry!

16:10.321 --> 16:11.454
She lost so much blood.

16:11.521 --> 16:12.688
Hurry up for God's sake.

16:12.754 --> 16:15.721
Leave Bey. We will take it from here.

16:23.354 --> 16:25.388
Sister! Sister!

16:25.454 --> 16:27.521
Gokce! My sister stop! Stop sister!

16:27.888 --> 16:30.554
Let them, let them do their job.

16:35.321 --> 16:36.821
Brother!

16:37.521 --> 16:38.754
Brother! What happened?

16:38.821 --> 16:41.754
While Titus was trying to kill me...

16:42.154 --> 16:43.688
...Selcan shielded herself to protect me.

16:44.121 --> 16:45.154
How is she now?

16:45.621 --> 16:48.188
She is not good at all. She is not good
at all my brother.

16:50.521 --> 16:52.188
Alps went after him.

16:52.454 --> 16:53.888
On your happiest day...

16:54.388 --> 16:57.754
God damn it!

17:01.488 --> 17:02.588
My brother.

17:06.488 --> 17:10.188
I promise you he will pay for the thing
he has done.

17:10.254 --> 17:11.488
If God permits, my brother.

17:11.621 --> 17:13.221
It is all my fault!

17:13.354 --> 17:16.888
It all happened because of me!
I should not have talked to her like that.

17:17.221 --> 17:19.088
Gokce do not say that. Pull yourself
together.

17:31.888 --> 17:33.321
Selcan.

17:39.188 --> 17:42.654
Send ten Alps towards Kurtbogazi.
Find the trace of that bastard!

17:43.288 --> 17:44.588
Find him!

17:45.488 --> 17:46.521
Abdurrahman.

17:46.821 --> 17:48.188
As you wish, Bey.

17:49.488 --> 17:51.521
My son. How are you?

17:52.554 --> 17:54.354
How can I be Mother?

17:57.588 --> 18:02.221
We have conquered the castle
but the victory is still far away.

18:42.888 --> 18:47.388
Until that bastard Titus is dead,
this matter will not be settled Bey.

18:47.721 --> 18:51.154
At first Dundar,
now my daughter-in-law Selcan.

18:51.488 --> 18:53.621
That degenerate is blinded by revenge.

18:53.888 --> 18:58.121
If given half the chance, he would
have killed Gundogdu in that very place.

18:58.754 --> 19:00.688
He got him without a sword
by the nomad tents.

19:03.121 --> 19:05.121
I wonder who's turn is it now?

19:06.454 --> 19:07.521
How is Selcan?

19:08.121 --> 19:09.454
Her condition is dire Bey.

19:10.388 --> 19:13.288
Poor girl sacrificed herself for Gundogdu.

19:15.088 --> 19:16.721
May God be pleased of her.

19:20.388 --> 19:22.254
What have we been through Hayme?

19:24.121 --> 19:26.388
As Selcan said once...

19:26.854 --> 19:30.854
...everything started when Ertugrul
brought Halime.

19:31.388 --> 19:33.121
Only with her presence...

19:34.088 --> 19:36.688
...did we realize the purulence in
our nomad tent.

19:39.621 --> 19:44.521
The lid blindfolded us was lift off
thanks to our daughter Halime.

19:45.654 --> 19:48.454
If God permits, we will get rid of this
purulence Bey.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.688
When our daughter Selcan recovers...

19:51.354 --> 19:55.621
...the peace we are longing for will come
to our nomad group, if God permits.

19:56.754 --> 19:59.188
After you safely return.

20:00.454 --> 20:03.388
If God permits, Hanim. If God permits.

20:03.688 --> 20:08.654
The proxy of our nomad group and the seal
of Seigniory is entrusted to you.

20:10.121 --> 20:13.188
And the glory of our nomad group is
entrusted to you as well.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.188
Do not worry, Bey.

20:17.188 --> 20:19.221
As long as I have you, I will never worry.

20:26.721 --> 20:28.654
It is time to take the road.

20:32.888 --> 20:34.621
Let me help you Bey.

20:50.321 --> 20:51.554
Bey.

20:51.888 --> 20:53.521
We will have a grandchild.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.354
Selcan is pregnant.

21:21.288 --> 21:23.321
I increased the security precautions
in the nomad group.

21:24.154 --> 21:26.554
However, if you do not have to,
do not go out of the nomad group.

21:26.688 --> 21:28.321
Do not worry about us Ertugrul.

21:29.854 --> 21:32.154
Your duty is heavy.

21:33.588 --> 21:36.154
Come back honorably, that is enough.

21:44.854 --> 21:49.821
The day you were shot by that traitor
still haunts me...

21:53.788 --> 21:58.588
...you falling to my arms,
sacrificing yourself for me.

22:00.654 --> 22:03.354
Everyone sacrifices their life for
their beloved, Ertugrul.

22:04.888 --> 22:06.621
Selcan did the same thing.

22:08.221 --> 22:11.788
After all the things she did to you,
you are still protecting Selcan.

22:13.354 --> 22:17.488
We all know indeed, her heart is
still pure.

22:18.421 --> 22:21.321
After all she broke bread with your
mother and father.

22:27.621 --> 22:29.854
Titus will never give up Ertugrul.

22:34.321 --> 22:39.254
He even tried to kill a little baby
to take the revenge of his brother Bisol.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.521
He is blinded by it.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.154
He got so out of hand that he even
harms women.

22:50.121 --> 22:51.588
I am sure he will come after you.

22:52.754 --> 22:56.554
I wish he would come and get
his destruction.

22:58.188 --> 22:59.454
He will.

22:59.521 --> 23:00.721
I have no doubt.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.321
Do not feel sad for that our wedding day
brought such pain to us, Ertugrul.

23:14.888 --> 23:17.688
Every day you came back home is
my wedding day.

23:20.454 --> 23:22.754
I only want you to be careful, alright?

23:32.554 --> 23:37.254
As long as you keep praying for my well
being, what is there to fret?

23:43.388 --> 23:44.754
Godspeed.

23:45.688 --> 23:47.421
May sun not burn your skin.

23:48.188 --> 23:49.754
May rain not make you cold.

23:51.288 --> 23:53.254
Nothing may get in your way.

23:55.008 --> 23:58.441
May it be easy to come back
to your nomad group.

24:25.908 --> 24:27.075
Stop, son.

24:27.341 --> 24:29.508
That load will not fit into that
sack anymore.

24:29.575 --> 24:31.641
Are we not going to take
the chest with us, Efendi?

24:32.475 --> 24:33.641
Do I have your permission?

24:34.375 --> 24:35.675
Come in.

24:38.275 --> 24:39.275
<i>Peace be upon you.</i>

24:39.341 --> 24:41.075
<i>And peace be upon you.</i>

24:47.441 --> 24:50.375
It is time to leave your nomad group, son.

24:51.541 --> 24:53.308
Will I be able to see you again?

24:53.441 --> 24:55.375
Surely one day our paths will cross.

24:56.041 --> 24:57.441
From Andalusia to here...

24:57.508 --> 24:59.375
...many place resided us.

24:59.875 --> 25:01.575
Many opened their hearts to us.

25:02.141 --> 25:06.408
However, none of them were as peaceful
as the Kayi nomad group.

25:06.475 --> 25:08.208
May God grants you blessings.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.475
Thank you.

25:10.975 --> 25:13.275
We had received you in our hard times.

25:14.141 --> 25:16.341
I witnessed your hard times.

25:16.541 --> 25:17.541
However...

25:18.175 --> 25:21.475
...as a seed sprouted to a new life...

25:21.908 --> 25:26.208
...I witnessed the pain of a new
resurrection in the Islam world.

25:28.041 --> 25:31.275
From now on, everything is in your
hands Ertugrul.

25:31.675 --> 25:33.208
You should know that.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.575
You become the ones who is entrusted
a mission...

25:36.375 --> 25:39.375
...may God give power to you
and your nomad group.

25:39.608 --> 25:41.441
May God let nothing to stand in your way.

25:42.341 --> 25:43.441
Amen.

25:44.975 --> 25:46.575
And may nothing stands in your way
as well.

26:02.575 --> 26:04.108
You forgot to take the chest, Efendi.

26:07.441 --> 26:12.141
As I have told you before son,
the deposit have found its owner now.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.075
For the moment do not open it.

26:17.675 --> 26:20.608
When the day comes, it will open for you.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.408
May I ask what is it inside?

26:27.041 --> 26:30.475
We could say that it is a little gift
which will help you when you feel the...

26:31.041 --> 26:36.575
...draught or swelter while carrying out
the task that your fate bring upon you.

26:39.675 --> 26:41.508
It is somewhat hard to open the chest.

26:43.408 --> 26:47.008
It has always been hard to breach
the shell and reach to the jewel inside.

26:47.608 --> 26:49.175
When the time comes...

26:49.941 --> 26:52.241
...you will breach the shell and reach
the jewel inside.

27:45.508 --> 27:46.608
Gokce Hatun...

27:48.008 --> 27:49.908
...I trust Selcan in your hands.

27:51.241 --> 27:54.475
Not only her but our baby, as well.

27:57.908 --> 27:59.975
May nothing stand in your way,
Gundogdu Bey.

28:00.608 --> 28:02.141
Be at ease.

28:02.908 --> 28:05.208
Both Halime and Mother Hayme are here
with us.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.875
If God permits, my sister will get better
until your return.

28:11.541 --> 28:12.608
If God permits.

28:13.075 --> 28:14.275
Safely.

28:19.441 --> 28:21.641
Halime Sultan...

28:22.508 --> 28:23.675
...welcome to our community.

28:24.175 --> 28:25.508
You came with graces.

28:26.375 --> 28:27.975
Thank you, Gundogdu Bey.

28:28.541 --> 28:30.441
I am honored by your words.

28:31.475 --> 28:33.308
Do not worry about Selcan Hatun.

28:33.541 --> 28:35.108
May God let nothing stand in your way.

28:35.641 --> 28:37.908
Amen. Safely.

29:14.508 --> 29:16.408
How is your wife, brother?

29:22.641 --> 29:24.141
We are going far.

29:25.508 --> 29:27.941
If you wish so, you should not
leave her alone.

29:28.674 --> 29:30.208
How can it be, brother?

29:31.441 --> 29:34.541
While Oghuzs fighting to death
with Mongols...

29:35.541 --> 29:38.875
...we should be united, we should
stand as one, like my father says.

29:39.875 --> 29:43.175
No doubt, I too will come to show him
that I support him.

29:47.908 --> 29:49.175
Is everything ready, Bamsi?

29:50.275 --> 29:52.208
We, Bey, we are always ready.

30:40.675 --> 30:42.208
-My brave boy.
-Brother.

30:42.575 --> 30:44.008
I trust this land to you.

32:23.641 --> 32:28.375
My grand grandfather Gokalp,
gave this ring to his son, Kizil Buga.

32:29.375 --> 32:32.541
And Kizil Buga, gave this to my father
Kaya Alp.

32:34.341 --> 32:36.575
And now I am trusting this to you.

32:38.641 --> 32:40.675
I may never come back.

32:41.408 --> 32:46.641
When the time comes, it is your duty
to give this to nomad group's Bey.

32:50.675 --> 32:53.041
This, firstly is your duty, Bey.

34:33.575 --> 34:37.675
May nothing stand in your way.

34:37.908 --> 34:43.275
May nothing stand in your way.

34:44.341 --> 34:47.608
May God let nothing stand in your way.

34:47.941 --> 34:51.475
May nothing stand in your way.

35:17.575 --> 35:20.275
I should not have spoken with you
that way, sister.

35:22.075 --> 35:23.941
However wrong it may be...

35:24.608 --> 35:26.175
...sinful it may be...

35:27.275 --> 35:29.475
...I should not have act that way to you.

35:33.175 --> 35:36.075
I should have respected you, sister.

35:37.041 --> 35:39.308
Forgive me sister, please.

35:46.075 --> 35:48.341
You are a part of me.

35:52.041 --> 35:54.541
Look, we will be blessed with a newborn.

35:56.141 --> 35:58.075
Sister you have to live.

36:00.108 --> 36:04.941
For Gundogdu Bey, for your baby,
you have to live sister.

36:07.308 --> 36:09.875
Do not give up sister, please.

36:30.541 --> 36:31.575
Gokce.

36:39.075 --> 36:44.075
It seems that Gundogdu has forgiven her,
as our Suleyman Shah.

36:44.608 --> 36:46.141
Thank God.

36:51.908 --> 36:55.375
From now on, everything will be
as good as the old days, Gokce.

37:00.241 --> 37:01.375
From now on...

37:02.175 --> 37:07.008
...we should not shadow our own happiness
which we earned by our bloody tears...

37:07.075 --> 37:11.975
...by blaming neither ourselves,
nor others.

37:16.175 --> 37:18.908
If God permits, my daughter Selcan will
get better as well.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.508
If God permits.

37:26.008 --> 37:29.241
Let us hope the pain in our nomad group
will come to an end, if God permits.

37:34.675 --> 37:36.941
You do understand me, do you not
my daughter?

39:17.408 --> 39:18.908
It is me, Titus.

39:19.041 --> 39:20.408
I could not realize that it is you,
my Lord.

39:21.508 --> 39:23.441
-Did you bring what I asked for?
-Yes, my Lord.

39:40.875 --> 39:41.941
Is there any news?

39:42.041 --> 39:46.008
Master Titus, Suleyman and his sons will
meet Oghuz Beys in...

39:46.075 --> 39:47.875
...a caravansary by the Euphrates.

39:48.108 --> 39:49.375
Oghuz Beys you say?

39:51.408 --> 39:53.075
What is happening, Cornelius?

39:53.175 --> 39:54.641
What are these Turks trying to do?

39:55.108 --> 39:58.341
It is said that they are seeking
an alliance against Mongols, my Lord.

40:01.641 --> 40:03.141
Damn them.

40:04.975 --> 40:06.608
Is the ambassador of Seljuk coming,
as well?

40:06.675 --> 40:09.508
Yes, my Lord. Aleaddin Keykubat
will send...

40:09.975 --> 40:12.241
...Ata Bey Celaleddin Karatay himself.

40:13.441 --> 40:17.508
This alliance is not solely
against the Mongols...

40:17.641 --> 40:21.341
...but against the crusader army as well.

40:22.241 --> 40:23.575
These Muslims.

40:26.241 --> 40:31.475
If they learn to act as one for once, this
will be the end of all of us, Cornelius.

40:32.375 --> 40:33.908
I cannot let that happen.

40:34.975 --> 40:38.541
Suleyman and his offspring must never
reach the caravansary.

40:38.908 --> 40:40.241
What do you want me to do, my Lord?

40:40.408 --> 40:41.641
Go at once.

40:42.341 --> 40:44.308
I will follow Ertugrul.

40:44.941 --> 40:46.208
Gather the men.

42:38.941 --> 42:40.141
Sun is about to set.

42:41.075 --> 42:42.441
Let us spend the night here.

43:14.241 --> 43:15.541
Have a look around.

43:15.675 --> 43:17.041
As you wish, Bey.

43:51.075 --> 43:52.541
We were in the roads for days, brother.

43:57.475 --> 43:58.941
You kept your silence.

44:00.875 --> 44:02.208
This saddens all of us.

44:03.175 --> 44:04.875
However, father is the most worried.

44:06.675 --> 44:08.108
Get yourself together.

44:09.508 --> 44:11.341
Our duty has much importance.

44:13.141 --> 44:14.441
You are right.

44:15.975 --> 44:17.975
You are right brother...

44:18.108 --> 44:20.375
...however I cannot stop myself
from thinking about Selcan.

44:21.441 --> 44:24.141
And that heathen called Titus, as well.

44:27.141 --> 44:29.475
Our maker will grant Selcan to you.

44:30.041 --> 44:31.175
I believe that.

44:32.041 --> 44:33.241
And Titus.

44:34.541 --> 44:36.141
The one gives him to you will be me.

44:37.108 --> 44:41.141
You will punish him for what he did to
both Dundar and your wife.

44:44.375 --> 44:46.008
Trust me.

44:49.341 --> 44:51.175
Father wishes to speak with us.

44:52.308 --> 44:53.575
Let us go.

45:05.508 --> 45:07.175
Be seated my sons.

45:18.008 --> 45:19.475
It is safe here, Bey.

45:23.641 --> 45:26.008
Since Titus has not attach us...

45:27.375 --> 45:29.975
...he must be planning a trap for us
which we cannot escape.

45:31.208 --> 45:32.341
You are right father.

45:33.108 --> 45:35.541
He learned the cost of directly
attacking us.

45:36.675 --> 45:38.575
He will set the trap near caravansary.

45:39.108 --> 45:42.108
If God permits, we will reach caravansary
at sundown tomorrow.

45:42.275 --> 45:44.408
If God permits, son. If God permits.

45:46.141 --> 45:47.141
We are few in numbers.

45:47.875 --> 45:49.108
Our duty is crucial.

45:50.008 --> 45:53.041
We can surprise him by taking a road that
no one can anticipate.

46:07.008 --> 46:09.208
This time he should be the one
falling our trap, father.

46:11.541 --> 46:14.041
We need to finish this job without
any bloodshed.

46:14.541 --> 46:18.408
But the most important thing is,
reaching caravansary in one piece.

46:40.908 --> 46:41.941
Ointment is ready.

46:42.675 --> 46:45.241
Eygis told me to put it on before
it loose its efficiency.

46:47.408 --> 46:49.675
I will do it Halime. Put it there.

47:00.408 --> 47:01.675
Mother.

47:03.041 --> 47:04.075
Halime.

47:06.408 --> 47:09.275
Wait daughter, I have things to say.

47:15.908 --> 47:17.975
We would like to enlarge the rug house.

47:18.041 --> 47:19.608
It seems that, from Damascus to Konya...

47:19.675 --> 47:23.275
...everyone is asking for our rugs,
our textiles.

47:23.941 --> 47:25.075
Praise be.

47:25.408 --> 47:31.208
Even the merchants coming from Constantine
are asking for our goods.

47:31.941 --> 47:35.475
We will send Wild Demir to Aleppo to
buy new handlooms.

47:35.975 --> 47:37.408
This will cost us, Mother.

47:37.941 --> 47:41.408
We will be using the loot that we obtained
from crusaders.

47:43.141 --> 47:45.008
There is one more thing.

47:46.575 --> 47:49.341
Both Suleyman Shah and me...

47:50.008 --> 47:53.341
...want you to become
the head of the rug house.

48:01.241 --> 48:04.008
So our wedding preparations should
continue as well, Mother.

48:04.075 --> 48:05.675
Of course, it will continue daughter.

48:05.908 --> 48:08.108
We should not be cut away from our
entertainment, right?

48:08.408 --> 48:10.208
You are right. Of course.

48:10.441 --> 48:13.641
If God permits, my daughter Selcan
also will get better.

48:24.208 --> 48:26.575
I am saying that the peace will come to
our nomad group however...

48:29.375 --> 48:33.375
...I do not know what is this
grayness I feel, Halime.

48:37.208 --> 48:39.041
Simply, you are weary Mother.

48:40.108 --> 48:41.375
Get some rest.

48:42.408 --> 48:45.275
Wild Demir and I will prepare
for the rug house.

48:45.341 --> 48:46.675
Do not worry, Mother.

48:49.675 --> 48:51.408
Thank you, my dear daughter.

48:53.408 --> 48:54.908
Thank you.

48:56.641 --> 48:58.508
Let us put the ointment on her at once.

49:14.441 --> 49:15.575
You both, go there.

49:16.341 --> 49:17.675
And you, return to your spots.

49:21.475 --> 49:23.675
Put two more men behind those bushes.

49:25.041 --> 49:26.941
First act should be done by them.

49:27.341 --> 49:29.641
After that, second archer unit will
attack to the Alps.

49:30.208 --> 49:31.308
And finally cavalcade.

49:31.375 --> 49:32.675
Yes, my Lord.

49:33.275 --> 49:34.608
You all, return to your spots.

51:25.308 --> 51:26.441
What happened?

51:26.908 --> 51:29.475
There is no one here.
What do you wish us to do?

51:34.308 --> 51:36.508
Get ready. We are going to caravansary.

51:38.241 --> 51:39.975
Get ready. We are leaving.

51:40.908 --> 51:42.308
Run Ertugrul.

51:42.641 --> 51:44.341
Let us see how far you can go.

51:48.341 --> 51:51.475
What if Banu Cicek fall for a brave man.
What can you do?

51:54.641 --> 52:00.041
As a wild flower like that withering,
would bees leave it alone, brother?

52:02.375 --> 52:07.141
Let us say bees become scared seeing that
Banu is so lively...

52:08.375 --> 52:13.408
...what if her father gives his daughter
to a brave...

52:13.941 --> 52:17.141
...ball of fire man then what can you do?

52:19.475 --> 52:20.875
You know what.

52:25.541 --> 52:26.908
What a foreboder man you are!

52:26.975 --> 52:28.675
-What did I say?
-Damn the things you said.

52:29.441 --> 52:30.875
Brother Turgut...

52:32.908 --> 52:37.908
...this shy rooster do not stop
splitting hairs. He will do nothing.

52:38.408 --> 52:42.541
If he is fallen for her, we need to nudge
this lazy brother a little.

52:44.341 --> 52:46.108
You are a wicked man.

52:50.575 --> 52:53.175
I wonder what will Titus do when he
realizes he cannot spot us.

52:53.941 --> 52:56.375
Surely, he will follow us until we reach
to caravansary.

52:56.641 --> 52:58.641
This will be the last trace
he will follow, father.

54:22.041 --> 54:24.141
Live long, Suleyman Shah.

54:24.208 --> 54:26.108
Live long, Ertugrul Bey.

54:26.241 --> 54:28.275
Live long, Gundogdu Bey.

54:28.341 --> 54:32.475
May your hands that collapsed the castle
of crusaders, will never bare hardship.

55:00.208 --> 55:01.208
Suleyman.

55:02.008 --> 55:03.541
Korkut.

55:09.208 --> 55:10.541
Welcome to you all.

55:10.908 --> 55:11.975
Thank you.

55:12.241 --> 55:14.541
Welcome, Suleyman Bey.

55:15.008 --> 55:17.608
The great Beys of Oghuz, thank you.

55:18.241 --> 55:20.141
Praise be.

55:20.241 --> 55:24.008
It seems that you overpowered
the crusaders with your brave sons.

55:25.308 --> 55:29.375
They have to wait forever to be able to
gather their army back together again...

55:29.675 --> 55:31.574
...to overpower us.

55:35.541 --> 55:37.408
I am not saying this because
I am their uncle.

55:38.941 --> 55:41.975
As long as you have these
brave sons of yours,...

55:42.241 --> 55:44.875
...you can sweep over their armies
as well.

55:45.375 --> 55:47.375
Thank you, Korkut. Thank you.

55:48.341 --> 55:50.641
How is my sister Hayme?

55:51.141 --> 55:52.541
She sent her regards.

55:53.075 --> 55:54.641
Wishes you well, Korkut.

55:59.941 --> 56:01.275
Korkut Bey is here as well.

56:03.141 --> 56:05.575
It is time to talk then.

56:07.541 --> 56:09.541
Should we ask for Banu Cicek for you?

56:09.975 --> 56:11.508
Are you trying to drive me mad?

56:12.641 --> 56:14.141
Make way.

56:15.341 --> 56:17.108
Come, let us toy with him.

56:17.575 --> 56:20.108
Do not. We have things to do.

56:23.475 --> 56:24.941
We did not forget that...

56:25.008 --> 56:28.275
...our son Ertugrul saved us from a major
disaster, Suleyman Bey.

56:29.175 --> 56:30.475
Thank you.

56:32.608 --> 56:34.875
<i>Suleyman Shah is not here with us.</i>

56:34.941 --> 56:38.308
<i>Because he collaborated with crusaders.</i>

56:38.375 --> 56:39.441
<i>Lie!</i>

56:40.041 --> 56:42.941
<i>This ignoble, casts aspersions on us.</i>

56:43.141 --> 56:45.908
<i>The ones sow discord among Islam world...</i>

56:46.275 --> 56:50.441
<i>...the ones who are trying to keep us</i>
 <i>from pray in Jerusalem...</i>

56:50.908 --> 56:57.008
<i>...now are trying to shatter Seljuk Empire</i>
 <i>by set Oghuzs against one another.</i>

56:57.141 --> 57:03.075
<i>This waste of a man who is trusted armies</i>
 <i>by Selahaddin Ayyubi's descendants...</i>

57:03.575 --> 57:05.875
<i>...is standing before you</i>
 <i>as a crusader army dog.</i>

57:27.541 --> 57:28.875
<i>May peace be upon you.</i>

57:28.941 --> 57:29.941
<i>And peace be upon you.</i>

57:30.008 --> 57:31.175
<i>And peace be upon you.</i>

57:31.608 --> 57:36.108
Suleyman Shah came with his sons Gundogdu
and Ertugrul, Ata Bey.

57:37.941 --> 57:42.241
Thank God we heard about the conquest
that you have done with your sons...

57:42.308 --> 57:43.575
...Suleyman Shah.

57:43.641 --> 57:47.408
Our Sultan, Aleaddin Keykubat asked me
to bring his regards...

57:47.475 --> 57:51.875
...as well as his greetings to you
and your sons.

57:53.008 --> 57:54.875
Thank you, Ata Bey Karatay.

57:55.441 --> 57:57.541
Give him my regards as well.

57:58.575 --> 58:04.241
May he accept the gift that we brought him
for his marriage with Damascus queen.

58:05.641 --> 58:07.175
Thank you, Suleyman Shah.

58:08.008 --> 58:11.175
Without your efforts,
our Sultan's wedding...

58:11.241 --> 58:12.475
...would not be taking place.

58:13.075 --> 58:16.608
Our Sultan's love and respect will not
leave your side.

58:17.075 --> 58:18.475
May God bless you.

58:19.508 --> 58:23.908
Go ahead get seated, get some rest.
Let them bring ayran to us.

58:23.975 --> 58:26.075
Let my nieces catch their breath.

58:26.241 --> 58:27.441
Go ahead.

58:52.475 --> 58:53.941
Ertugrul has come.

58:54.175 --> 58:56.975
White bearded men will be receiving
Ertugrul this evening.

59:40.375 --> 59:41.608
Hatuns.

59:45.075 --> 59:46.408
I have things to say.

59:48.175 --> 59:50.508
You are working for days without a break.

59:51.241 --> 59:53.575
Some of you weaves cloths,
some of you weaves rugs.

59:54.308 --> 59:57.208
Some of you stitches clothing for Alps,
some of you prepares armor.

59:57.608 --> 59:58.875
However...

00:59:59.008 --> 01:00:04.108
...even after we bought handlooms,
we did not make as much goods as intended.

01:00:05.041 --> 01:00:06.508
I know you are weary.

01:00:07.508 --> 01:00:12.241
But what will we do if we take
migration path up again?

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:17.575
What is more, the clothing and armor that
we made for Alps are not enough.

01:00:18.575 --> 01:00:20.275
What I want to say Hatuns...

01:00:21.208 --> 01:00:23.375
...until Suleyman Shah returns
to our nomad group...

01:00:24.075 --> 01:00:26.408
...we have to reach the numbers
he gave us.

01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:30.641
I am willing to teach my job to our
willing young women.

01:00:31.675 --> 01:00:35.441
If we increase our numbers,
we will be able to make more goods.

01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:41.575
Do you understand me, Hatuns?

01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:45.341
-Understood, Halime.
-Understood.

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:48.175
Thank you Hatuns. May is be easy.

01:00:48.241 --> 01:00:49.675
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:00:55.908 --> 01:00:58.475
It is clear that she will be the
Mother of our nomad group in the future.

01:00:58.975 --> 01:01:01.875
She is already aching to be in her
mother in law's favor.

01:01:37.141 --> 01:01:38.441
How is your back, father?

01:01:40.975 --> 01:01:44.941
It is nothing compared to facing
a sore like Kurtoglu, son.

01:01:45.675 --> 01:01:47.508
We pull through many sores.

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:53.008
Hearing that from Konya Palace to
Cairo Palace...

01:01:53.908 --> 01:01:59.941
...everyone praising you,
brings me honor son.

01:02:01.175 --> 01:02:03.141
Your abilities and...

01:02:03.675 --> 01:02:05.508
...intelligence surpassed me tenfold.

01:02:06.575 --> 01:02:07.941
Not at all, father.

01:02:08.208 --> 01:02:09.875
It should surpass, son.

01:02:10.441 --> 01:02:16.241
You are the only one among us
that has Bey vision and state vision.

01:02:17.975 --> 01:02:21.575
Upon seeing your abilities...

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:24.041
...I realized this fact as well.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:32.175
You showed us that our nomad group
will live on.

01:02:33.308 --> 01:02:34.941
After I am gone...

01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:37.675
...you will shoulder the burden of
our nomad group.

01:02:38.308 --> 01:02:39.308
Father.

01:02:39.375 --> 01:02:41.408
Your brother knows this as well, son.

01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:43.241
He embraced it.

01:02:44.208 --> 01:02:46.275
You should prepare yourself to this,
as well.

01:02:49.441 --> 01:02:53.075
It is certain that we will return to our
nomad group with a new mission, son.

01:02:54.008 --> 01:02:56.308
May God favor us.

01:02:57.908 --> 01:02:59.075
Amen, father.

01:03:10.341 --> 01:03:11.541
Then what happened Konur Alp?

01:03:12.075 --> 01:03:14.508
Banu Cicek did not marry that man
as well Turgut.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.141
Gosh.

01:03:16.241 --> 01:03:20.641
Among many candidates, why does not she
pick one?

01:03:21.175 --> 01:03:23.241
It is said that she has fallen
for someone.

01:03:23.441 --> 01:03:24.675
Gosh.

01:03:25.208 --> 01:03:26.908
I wonder who is that man?

01:03:30.108 --> 01:03:31.641
Have you seen Ertugrul Bey?

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:34.541
Here he comes.

01:03:42.475 --> 01:03:43.508
What did Dogan do?

01:03:44.641 --> 01:03:47.275
He is tending the servants of caravansary,
Bey.

01:03:47.508 --> 01:03:51.608
Like you said brother, do not be surprised
if there is a crusader among them.

01:03:52.008 --> 01:03:55.275
Bamsi and I will take a look around
as well.

01:03:55.475 --> 01:03:58.408
Let us see if that waste of a man
Titus came so far out here.

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:01.641
Be careful.

01:04:01.875 --> 01:04:03.908
-As you wish, Bey.
-As you wish, Bey.

01:04:10.108 --> 01:04:11.375
Turgut.

01:04:12.108 --> 01:04:14.541
I do not like this Afsin Bey, brother.

01:04:15.308 --> 01:04:21.275
Especially when they do things in secret
with Bey, I became very irritated.

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:23.508
Irritated, brother.

01:04:27.241 --> 01:04:29.275
Let us mind our business, brother.

01:04:31.341 --> 01:04:32.508
Come with me.

01:04:41.941 --> 01:04:43.341
You will go in alone.

01:04:45.308 --> 01:04:46.608
Why are you not coming in, Afsin?

01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:49.241
Our rank is not sufficient, Bey.

01:04:52.275 --> 01:04:54.008
Go ahead.

01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:21.363
May peace be upon you.

01:05:22.429 --> 01:05:25.363
And peace be upon you.
Son of Suleyman Shah, Ertugrul.

01:05:25.529 --> 01:05:26.896
Be seated.

01:05:35.396 --> 01:05:36.929
You asked for me.

01:05:37.529 --> 01:05:38.563
Yes, son.

01:05:39.163 --> 01:05:43.496
We asked for you to see the face of the
one we have been hearing about.

01:05:44.163 --> 01:05:47.996
To understand the mind of the one we
have seen before us.

01:05:52.963 --> 01:05:54.063
I am listening.

01:05:55.529 --> 01:05:57.196
You have been in and out of many wars...

01:05:58.229 --> 01:05:59.963
...go through many hardships...

01:06:00.163 --> 01:06:02.563
...meeting enemies, seeing the world.

01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:06.429
Tell me, what is the state of the world.

01:06:09.763 --> 01:06:11.296
World is in a crisis.

01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:16.363
On one hand there is crusaders,
on the other Mongols...

01:06:17.163 --> 01:06:20.863
...and then there is us, fighting a war
over Anatolia.

01:06:22.163 --> 01:06:26.129
All in power knows that
dominating the Anatolia...

01:06:27.363 --> 01:06:29.829
...means dominating the world.

01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:34.796
Then, which one of you will succeed
in your opinion?

01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:43.196
Crusaders came here with a great force.

01:06:43.796 --> 01:06:47.263
When they departed they had the purpose of
taking hold of the Jerusalem.

01:06:48.196 --> 01:06:49.229
However...

01:06:50.229 --> 01:06:53.029
...every time they arrived here
they forgot their purpose and...

01:06:53.096 --> 01:06:54.363
...went for the loot instead.

01:06:56.063 --> 01:06:57.229
Mongols...

01:06:57.496 --> 01:06:58.963
...they want to come to Anatolia...

01:07:00.429 --> 01:07:03.429
...however they are like a hungry wolf
attacking the herd.

01:07:04.129 --> 01:07:05.563
They go back once they are full.

01:07:06.896 --> 01:07:08.496
Then us?

01:07:09.296 --> 01:07:11.063
What do you say about us?

01:07:14.229 --> 01:07:18.896
We first came to Anatolia under the
leadership of Tugrul and Cagri Bey's.

01:07:19.529 --> 01:07:21.929
Then Sultan Alparslan...

01:07:22.329 --> 01:07:25.363
...with battle of Manzikent,
opened the doors of Anatolia for us.

01:07:27.129 --> 01:07:28.296
However...

01:07:29.763 --> 01:07:31.063
...our unity is broken down.

01:07:33.363 --> 01:07:35.029
If we can unite...

01:07:35.763 --> 01:07:37.163
...and provide justice...

01:07:38.496 --> 01:07:40.229
...Anatolia will be ours.

01:07:41.796 --> 01:07:45.296
Son, if you wish these lands to be ours...

01:07:48.329 --> 01:07:50.096
...you need to listen to me carefully.

01:07:51.863 --> 01:07:55.896
And not even once, you will leave our
advices aside.

01:08:38.463 --> 01:08:41.129
Even my weapon sheds rubies...

01:08:41.563 --> 01:08:45.829
...as long as I am alive I will fight
for this purpose.

01:08:47.196 --> 01:08:51.229
And I will wave the flag of justice once
more in Anatolia.

01:09:14.015 --> 01:09:15.115
Gokce.

01:09:18.548 --> 01:09:20.082
Gokce.

01:09:22.215 --> 01:09:23.915
I brought you supper.

01:09:43.148 --> 01:09:45.282
Gokce, have I done something to
break your heart?

01:09:56.548 --> 01:09:58.148
My sister was always ambitious.

01:10:00.448 --> 01:10:02.148
She committed many sins.

01:10:04.482 --> 01:10:06.448
But she was right at one thing.

01:10:08.182 --> 01:10:09.582
Ertugrul.

01:10:12.682 --> 01:10:16.048
When Ertugrul saved you from crusaders and
brought you to our nomad tent...

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:21.648
...she told me that nothing will be
the same ever again.

01:10:25.515 --> 01:10:26.915
She was right.

01:10:33.015 --> 01:10:35.048
Maybe if you did not came
to this nomad tent...

01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:38.982
...this would not happen to my sister,
Halime.

01:10:42.015 --> 01:10:44.015
Are you still talking about Ertugrul,
Gokce?

01:10:46.582 --> 01:10:49.382
I thought that you were done with this
matter after everything that happened.

01:10:49.948 --> 01:10:50.948
I am done.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.348
While suffering this pain...

01:10:54.882 --> 01:10:57.282
...while ripping Ertugrul
out of my heart...

01:10:58.082 --> 01:11:00.582
...I did not do this for your sake,
Halime.

01:11:02.282 --> 01:11:03.615
I did it for Ertugrul.

01:11:06.082 --> 01:11:07.348
For his happiness.

01:11:10.682 --> 01:11:13.248
I hope that you will cherish him
the way he deserves.

01:11:19.548 --> 01:11:21.282
I will take my leave then.

01:12:11.115 --> 01:12:12.115
Mother.

01:12:12.182 --> 01:12:14.615
<i>O God, let Your Peace come upon</i>
 <i>Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.</i>

01:12:17.982 --> 01:12:19.382
Mother, are you alright?

01:12:22.182 --> 01:12:26.348
May God favor us daughter,
I had a dream, I am alright.

01:12:26.948 --> 01:12:28.382
May God favor us.

01:12:29.482 --> 01:12:31.348
Wait Mother, I will give you some water.

01:12:39.615 --> 01:12:41.115
Take it Mother, drink.

01:12:50.082 --> 01:12:52.948
I have been seeing the same dream
in the last couple of days.

01:12:53.915 --> 01:12:57.515
A river, flows thick and fast.

01:12:59.615 --> 01:13:01.048
However.

01:13:01.482 --> 01:13:02.915
However what, Mother?

01:13:06.082 --> 01:13:09.315
However, Suleyman...

01:13:42.448 --> 01:13:45.048
Master Titus, there is no way to go in.

01:13:46.315 --> 01:13:47.582
How about the kitchen?

01:13:48.148 --> 01:13:50.215
Unfortunately we were not able to
poison the cauldrons.

01:13:50.415 --> 01:13:53.448
They are pouring the food out and make it
once more in their own ways.

01:13:53.882 --> 01:13:56.415
Korkut Bey brought women from his
nomad tent to prepare food.

01:13:57.482 --> 01:14:00.282
Then, are we able to learn
what they are discussing inside?

01:14:00.415 --> 01:14:03.915
Of course, my Lord.
Our inside man will come to inform you.

01:14:21.215 --> 01:14:24.348
Are you talking about fighting against
Mongols, Karatay?

01:14:25.215 --> 01:14:29.248
To protect the state of Aleaddin,
do you want to sacrifice us...

01:14:29.315 --> 01:14:31.348
...while there is so few of us
left already?

01:14:31.415 --> 01:14:35.982
The state of Sultan Aleaddin, opened
his arms to the fullest to embrace Oghuzs.

01:14:36.415 --> 01:14:40.015
Bad blood in the past has been dealt with.

01:14:40.215 --> 01:14:41.282
To what cost?

01:14:41.615 --> 01:14:43.482
There is blood shed all over us.

01:14:44.582 --> 01:14:47.682
What happens when Sultan Aleaddin
abdicate the throne?

01:14:49.048 --> 01:14:51.915
Similar to old days,
who knows what the new Sultan...

01:14:52.215 --> 01:14:54.382
...after acquiring the throne,
will do to us?

01:14:59.948 --> 01:15:01.282
Hayat Bey is right.

01:15:01.348 --> 01:15:04.148
Every hardship falls on us, nomads.

01:15:04.948 --> 01:15:07.315
We will fight to our last breath.

01:15:07.948 --> 01:15:10.648
However, no one stood beside us
in our hard times.

01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:12.048
He is right.

01:15:12.648 --> 01:15:14.348
What Hayat Bey said is right.

01:15:14.415 --> 01:15:16.115
We are always the ones that left behind.

01:15:27.482 --> 01:15:28.648
Beys...

01:15:29.882 --> 01:15:31.215
...elders of my kin...

01:15:32.548 --> 01:15:34.182
...I agree with you
from the bottom of my heart.

01:15:36.082 --> 01:15:37.682
We were belittled for being nomads.

01:15:38.948 --> 01:15:42.548
Both Ayyubis and Farisis acted this way.

01:15:44.115 --> 01:15:45.448
We were pushed around.

01:15:46.882 --> 01:15:49.615
However, Sultan Aleaddin is different.

01:15:50.648 --> 01:15:52.382
Like Ata Bey said...

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:54.615
...he opened his arms to embrace
all of us.

01:15:56.415 --> 01:16:00.015
Great Beys of my kin
whom I know their bravery well...

01:16:01.148 --> 01:16:04.148
...there is no one among ourselves
who does not know how many Alps...

01:16:04.215 --> 01:16:07.082
...fallen martyr fighting against
crusaders.

01:16:08.448 --> 01:16:10.182
We learned many things in this war.

01:16:10.515 --> 01:16:14.182
We would like to hear what you learned
from you, Ertugrul Bey.

01:16:17.648 --> 01:16:21.015
Every problem starts from within.

01:16:22.115 --> 01:16:23.482
I say...

01:16:23.548 --> 01:16:25.882
...we should not be the mite that
gnaw to this almighty sycamore...

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:28.615
...which has been planted
by Alparslan himself.

01:16:29.682 --> 01:16:34.515
If this almighty sycamore falls over,
we all will get buried by it.

01:16:35.482 --> 01:16:40.248
Our voyage that started in Otuken, will
come to an end in this beautiful land.

01:16:50.382 --> 01:16:51.515
Beys...

01:16:52.415 --> 01:16:55.415
...against Mongol demons coming
in waves from east...

01:16:56.582 --> 01:17:00.015
...and crusaders rise deviously
from west...

01:17:01.215 --> 01:17:07.048
...our job is to unite as one
under the holy coat of Ahmet Yesevi.

01:17:08.415 --> 01:17:10.615
If we cannot become united as one...

01:17:12.215 --> 01:17:14.648
...we would be betraying both
our voyage from Otuken...

01:17:15.615 --> 01:17:18.415
...and the heritage of Yesevi.

01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.115
May almighty God...

01:17:26.548 --> 01:17:29.315
...preserves us from
disobeying our prophet's legacy.

01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:37.215
For that, great Beys of Oghuzs...

01:17:39.048 --> 01:17:41.482
...I say it is time to unite as one.

01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:45.215
Islam world is shattered.

01:17:46.882 --> 01:17:48.682
The resurrection fire that we scorch...

01:17:49.482 --> 01:17:54.182
...will spread to the world and a new Turk
seigniory will come to light.

01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:04.682
Now...

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:09.148
...I say that we unite against Mongols...

01:18:10.182 --> 01:18:12.348
...and close our ranks in Anatolia.

01:18:26.315 --> 01:18:28.115
Do you agree to this unity Beys?

01:19:07.248 --> 01:19:08.915
Suleyman Shah...

01:19:09.482 --> 01:19:12.415
...history will write this things that
you have done one day.

01:19:21.015 --> 01:19:23.648
We are throwing ourselves into
the fire again.

01:20:27.215 --> 01:20:29.948
Up until today, this degenerate entrapped
us time and time again.

01:20:32.482 --> 01:20:35.215
Now it is his turn to be entrapped.

01:20:39.215 --> 01:20:44.215
God is the most favorable of the ones
that set traps.

01:20:48.682 --> 01:20:50.448
Come on.

01:21:04.448 --> 01:21:07.348
I know that we have no other choice
as well, father.

01:21:08.082 --> 01:21:13.382
However, is it right to go against
Mongols, solely with swords at hand?

01:21:15.582 --> 01:21:17.115
You talk about a unity.

01:21:17.615 --> 01:21:19.415
What if the unity breaks down?

01:21:20.348 --> 01:21:22.882
Then, what can we do all alone?

01:21:25.382 --> 01:21:27.915
I feel your worries as well, son.

01:21:28.615 --> 01:21:32.515
However Kayis destiny is already set.

01:21:33.515 --> 01:21:35.082
Our way points towards Anatolia.

01:21:36.282 --> 01:21:38.282
And there is no way back from it.

01:21:40.448 --> 01:21:43.115
May God favor us.

01:21:46.248 --> 01:21:47.648
Thank you, brother.

01:22:00.615 --> 01:22:01.915
Bey.

01:22:02.915 --> 01:22:04.182
Bey you were right.

01:22:04.448 --> 01:22:06.048
Titus is here.

01:22:07.282 --> 01:22:10.248
He came by the caravansary
with his knights.

01:22:11.115 --> 01:22:12.382
We confirmed his location.

01:23:48.282 --> 01:23:50.048
Finally.

01:23:50.415 --> 01:23:52.048
Our paths came across.

01:23:52.582 --> 01:23:56.215
Let us see if you are as brave as you are
going against women and children.

01:23:57.415 --> 01:24:01.248
At least I am not as stupid as going
against the whole world as you do.

01:24:01.615 --> 01:24:07.182
As long as you follow God's will,
no matter if you are alone Titus.

01:24:08.315 --> 01:24:11.648
But a lost demon like you would not
be able to understand that.

01:24:13.015 --> 01:24:17.882
I will collapse the order that you created
by treachery and betrayal, around you.

01:24:18.215 --> 01:24:20.515
Me and my kin.

01:24:20.682 --> 01:24:22.148
So do we.

01:24:22.682 --> 01:24:25.282
We will not stop until you go back
the hell you came from.

01:24:25.582 --> 01:24:28.915
We all came from God,
we will return to him.

01:24:30.015 --> 01:24:33.148
But soon you will see the hell
you will go back to.

01:24:33.982 --> 01:24:35.915
Come and send me there then.

01:28:47.315 --> 01:28:48.648
Kill me Turk.

01:28:58.882 --> 01:29:00.515
You are the destiny of my brother.

01:29:17.415 --> 01:29:19.582
Victory will be God's.

01:29:22.048 --> 01:29:25.448
We do not doubt that, praise God.

01:29:48.248 --> 01:29:49.415
We have a long way ahead.

01:29:49.982 --> 01:29:51.248
Thank you, brother.

01:29:52.015 --> 01:29:54.582
We should not keep the ones missing us
waiting any longer.

01:31:04.182 --> 01:31:05.482
Thank you.

01:31:12.082 --> 01:31:14.615
Upon seeing you people will think that
you are not a new bride...

01:31:14.682 --> 01:31:16.482
...but a mourning widower, Halime Sultan.

01:31:18.882 --> 01:31:19.882
What is wrong?

01:31:20.415 --> 01:31:22.115
Why are you so sad?

01:31:24.515 --> 01:31:25.648
Gokce.

01:31:33.015 --> 01:31:35.148
Tell me. What happened?

01:31:38.348 --> 01:31:40.348
She still talks about Ertugrul.

01:31:42.682 --> 01:31:44.148
How about her heart?

01:31:48.148 --> 01:31:50.215
The wound of her heart poisons her tongue.

01:31:53.515 --> 01:31:56.382
I do not know how long
this will go on, Aykiz.

01:31:58.482 --> 01:32:00.915
She told Ertugrul that he is
as her brother however...

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:03.115
Her heart will get cold, do not worry.

01:32:05.448 --> 01:32:10.482
While trying to put out the fire in her
heart, she went through a lot of pain.

01:32:12.648 --> 01:32:14.182
Finally, Selcan.

01:32:15.648 --> 01:32:19.215
There is no one that she can confide
in as well.

01:32:21.882 --> 01:32:25.015
Do not give her a hard time.
It will all pass.

01:32:26.948 --> 01:32:28.882
What if it does not happen
the way you think?

01:32:31.315 --> 01:32:33.148
Then what can we do, Aykiz?

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:38.182
How can we face one another
in this nomad tent?

01:32:50.315 --> 01:32:51.582
Good bye.

01:32:52.215 --> 01:32:53.348
Thank you, Afsin.

01:32:54.648 --> 01:32:58.015
After you set your nomad tent, I will come
as soon as possible, if God permits.

01:33:20.182 --> 01:33:21.515
Afsin Bey.

01:33:23.382 --> 01:33:24.948
I will tell you one thing.

01:33:25.948 --> 01:33:27.082
Do tell.

01:33:28.448 --> 01:33:31.082
Say the thing you have been keeping
to yourself and be at ease.

01:33:34.015 --> 01:33:35.982
Father of lineage Yigit.

01:33:38.315 --> 01:33:39.582
Did you kill him?

01:33:49.948 --> 01:33:51.115
Bamsi.

01:33:56.082 --> 01:33:57.582
I am sorry, Bey.

01:33:58.148 --> 01:34:00.348
I could not get a hold of my tongue again.

01:34:02.115 --> 01:34:04.382
We were always one of those who
had a duty, Bamsi.

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:08.548
May God help us in our new duty.

01:34:10.148 --> 01:34:12.348
May God grant you to be the ones...

01:34:13.382 --> 01:34:15.882
...not hurting their loved ones
but helping their lives prosper.

01:34:37.148 --> 01:34:39.082
Good bye.

01:34:52.248 --> 01:34:53.282
Father.

01:34:56.015 --> 01:34:57.248
Father.

01:34:58.015 --> 01:34:59.615
We can stay in caravansary, if you wish.

01:34:59.982 --> 01:35:01.215
We can leave tomorrow.

01:35:01.482 --> 01:35:03.082
I am alright, alright.

01:35:03.615 --> 01:35:05.882
We have much to do in our nomad group.

01:35:06.482 --> 01:35:10.648
It became our destiny to migrate again
before the end of summer.

01:36:09.148 --> 01:36:14.215
It is said, Korkut Ata from Hayat tribe,
one man stands tall.

01:36:15.615 --> 01:36:16.982
Korkut Ata says...

01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:25.215
...in those times, when a boy does not
shed blood they would not name him.

01:36:26.415 --> 01:36:28.348
And they would not give their ranks
to Beys.

01:36:29.148 --> 01:36:30.382
-Gosh!
-Gosh!

01:36:31.115 --> 01:36:34.315
When the boys ride horses, wield swords,
shoot arrows...

01:36:35.148 --> 01:36:36.682
...be brave as you are...

01:36:37.148 --> 01:36:40.448
...then they would become subjected to
the training of becoming an Alp.

01:36:41.148 --> 01:36:44.448
Do you think we do deserve such training,
as Suleyman Shah says, Wild Demir?

01:36:46.982 --> 01:36:48.348
Of course my brave boy.

01:36:49.215 --> 01:36:52.482
Did you not open the way to us
to go into the castle of crusaders?

01:36:54.148 --> 01:36:55.982
Did you not stand against enemies
in Aleppo?

01:36:56.548 --> 01:37:02.682
Did you not protect our ancestors' honor
by not being fooled by their threats?

01:37:03.882 --> 01:37:05.582
Dundar...

01:37:05.882 --> 01:37:10.048
...you, did you not save your father,
your family and your nomad group...

01:37:10.448 --> 01:37:15.115
...by standing against the cowardly Titus?

01:37:16.081 --> 01:37:18.915
If you did not, Kurtoglu would unite...

01:37:19.948 --> 01:37:22.581
...with him and kill your father and
your brothers.

01:37:26.315 --> 01:37:27.982
I did not do anything, Wild Demir.

01:37:28.282 --> 01:37:29.648
Only...

01:37:32.215 --> 01:37:33.515
Dundar.

01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:36.882
The best quality of an Alp is humility.

01:37:37.982 --> 01:37:40.282
As I see it, thank God you both have it.

01:37:41.182 --> 01:37:46.315
Humility, honesty, hospitality,
generosity.

01:37:48.282 --> 01:37:50.915
An Alp should not act arrogantly.

01:37:52.182 --> 01:37:54.182
Should not think himself as superior.

01:37:56.282 --> 01:37:59.482
Kara Polat should own his mind's sword.

01:38:00.615 --> 01:38:02.348
Should act without pity.

01:38:04.682 --> 01:38:07.582
One cannot become an Alp if he is fond
of riches.

01:38:08.515 --> 01:38:11.015
Though he cannot be a man as well,
anyhow.

01:38:12.115 --> 01:38:15.115
The one you call Alp should learn to tan
somebody's hide from his ancestors.

01:38:15.382 --> 01:38:17.382
He should stand a man on his horse.

01:38:18.182 --> 01:38:21.082
Children plays with mind's sword,
but man must own it.

01:38:23.448 --> 01:38:28.315
He should protect other's order.
He should not know lies.

01:38:29.382 --> 01:38:33.648
Shedding blood is not enough to become
an Alp.

01:38:38.148 --> 01:38:43.448
Virtue and merit are the most important
things that made one an Alp, indeed.

01:38:44.548 --> 01:38:46.948
And of course, a sword.

01:38:50.115 --> 01:38:55.082
An Alps needs a sword as virtuous and
skillful as he is.

01:38:57.148 --> 01:38:58.948
I am making these swords for you.

01:39:00.415 --> 01:39:04.648
As I did for Suleyman Shah, Gundogdu
and Ertugrul.

01:39:11.482 --> 01:39:13.615
Where did Suleyman Shah go, Wild Demir?

01:39:14.382 --> 01:39:18.615
There is no way to run from the Mongols
that chase us for years, brave boy.

01:39:19.348 --> 01:39:23.648
It is high time to make a unity and
stop this calamity.

01:39:25.648 --> 01:39:29.548
We either win and live or we die.

01:39:30.415 --> 01:39:31.882
There is no other way.

01:39:37.982 --> 01:39:39.215
Is that the reason of them leaving?

01:39:40.182 --> 01:39:41.415
Yes, son.

01:39:42.682 --> 01:39:44.615
May God help them.

01:39:45.615 --> 01:39:47.282
Amen.

01:39:59.397 --> 01:40:01.463
Should we rest here for a while, Bey?

01:40:03.730 --> 01:40:05.663
You take me for an old man.

01:40:07.563 --> 01:40:08.830
How could that be, father?

01:40:09.963 --> 01:40:12.363
You could take all of us down,
with God's help.

01:40:14.397 --> 01:40:16.330
We said it for the horses.

01:41:13.897 --> 01:41:14.897
Bey.

01:41:16.363 --> 01:41:19.330
Let’s go cross the river first and
take a look around.

01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:22.730
Hurry.

01:42:09.397 --> 01:42:11.230
I am thankful to you, my God.

01:42:12.730 --> 01:42:16.697
Thank you for giving us a heart to stop
and listen to all this beauty...

01:42:16.897 --> 01:42:22.530
...you have created and to embrace them
with good sight.

01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:27.297
Thank You for letting me
follow Your way for a lifetime...

01:42:27.497 --> 01:42:31.997
...and permitting me to raise
my brave sons.

01:42:34.797 --> 01:42:39.763
Thank You, for giving me a short and
pleasant life, like the sound...

01:42:39.863 --> 01:42:45.330
...of this nightingale,
united with my sons' mother.

01:43:48.630 --> 01:43:50.697
Father.

01:43:51.997 --> 01:43:53.263
Father!

01:43:57.563 --> 01:43:58.563
Father!

01:44:05.630 --> 01:44:06.630
Father!

01:45:43.763 --> 01:45:45.730
I trust our nomad group in your hands.

01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:51.363
Protect our nomad group...

01:45:51.463 --> 01:45:54.963
...from all the kinds of evil,
like you do for your wives...

01:45:56.563 --> 01:45:57.997
...and for your children.

01:46:13.530 --> 01:46:15.963
Obey the laws of our ancestor Oghuz...

01:46:17.197 --> 01:46:20.996
...and the state of Seljuk
that came from it.

01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:24.497
Be one and lively.

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:24.230
Bey?

01:48:26.863 --> 01:48:27.963
Bey.

01:48:34.363 --> 01:48:35.397
Bey!

01:50:14.630 --> 01:50:16.797
Rest in peace, Bey.

01:50:45.597 --> 01:50:47.797
I intend to say my prayers
for God's sake.

01:50:48.463 --> 01:50:49.963
To pray for the Meyyit.

01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:51.830
For a man...

01:51:40.363 --> 01:51:42.363
What are your thoughts on the deceased?

01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:43.563
He was a good person.

01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:46.263
-Do you give your blessings?
-Yes, we do.

01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:49.597
-Do you?
-Yes, we do.

01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:52.263
-Do you?
-Yes, we do.

01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:18.897
<i>Brave sons of Kayi,</i>
 <i>may God, Who turns night into day...</i>

01:58:19.197 --> 01:58:22.663
<i>...day into sun, bare witness,</i>
 <i>this is not a tale.</i>

01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:28.497
<i>The story I will tell is the real story</i>
 <i>of a blessed way and voyage...</i>

01:58:29.563 --> 01:58:34.863
<i>...that will reach from Otuken mountains</i>
 <i>to Anatolia...</i>

01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:38.730
<i>...from Anatolia to many conquests</i>
 <i>and conquerors.</i>

01:58:39.597 --> 01:58:44.297
<i>This story is the story that made</i>
 <i>our Bey, Suleyman Shah...</i>

01:58:44.397 --> 01:58:47.197
<i>...amongst many other Beys.</i>

01:58:48.330 --> 01:58:51.597
<i>Suleyman Shah is the one who</i>
 <i>never turned his back on humility...</i>

01:58:51.697 --> 01:58:54.430
<i>...bravery, chivalry...</i>

01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:57.630
<i>...and God's justice,</i>
 <i>the one who knew that...</i>

01:58:57.730 --> 01:59:01.397
<i>...being united as one means to exist...</i>

01:59:01.497 --> 01:59:05.863
<i>...the one who is the gem of</i>
 <i>the Turkic history...</i>

01:59:05.963 --> 01:59:10.197
<i>...to be told by our ancestors</i>
 <i>until today...</i>

01:59:10.397 --> 01:59:13.863
<i>...and from this day forth.</i>

01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:21.563
<i>From Oghuz Khan to today,</i>
 <i>from today to many Sultans...</i>

01:59:21.663 --> 01:59:26.930
<i>...and many conquests, he is a victorious</i>
 <i>Bey in our glorious history...</i>

01:59:29.730 --> 01:59:35.263
<i>...who has been entrusted to carry on</i>
 <i>yesterday's history to tomorrow’s.</i>

01:59:37.363 --> 01:59:40.763
<i>He protected this trust with his own life.</i>

01:59:43.363 --> 01:59:45.563
<i>He never let his nomad group go</i>
 <i>hungry or be alone.</i>

01:59:46.663 --> 01:59:49.263
<i>He never turned his back on God's justice.</i>

01:59:50.197 --> 01:59:53.197
<i>He always knew his God</i>
 <i>and his ancestor's laws.</i>

01:59:54.697 --> 01:59:59.230
<i>He fought but never lost either</i>
 <i>to his own self or to the enemy.</i>

02:00:00.997 --> 02:00:04.363
<i>Neither the betrayals that came from</i>
 <i>the ones who are close to him nor...</i>

02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:07.597
<i>...other hardships were able to</i>
 <i>turn him away from his ways.</i>

02:00:08.863 --> 02:00:13.297
<i>Neither the cruelty of a tyrant, nor the</i>
 <i>power of the heathen could stop him.</i>

02:00:16.730 --> 02:00:19.563
<i>For him, Kayi was entrusted to him</i>
 <i>by his children.</i>

02:00:20.997 --> 02:00:25.397
<i>He carried that trust to this day,</i>
 <i>as a Bey, as a Shah...</i>

02:00:25.497 --> 02:00:29.597
<i>...as Suleyman Shah, so that you could be</i>
 <i>conquerors so that...</i>

02:00:29.863 --> 02:00:35.597
<i>...there will be no cruelty or</i>
 <i>tyrants left, with God's permission.</i>

02:00:37.297 --> 02:00:40.463
<i>Now that trust is yours.</i>

02:00:41.397 --> 02:00:44.730
<i>It is a debt. It is our burden.</i>

02:00:45.763 --> 02:00:47.897
<i>May God bestow his graces upon him.</i>

02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:52.897
<i>And may God put you in the way</i>
 <i>of many conquests, if God permits.</i>

02:00:54.263 --> 02:00:58.563
<i>Do not forget my children,</i>
 <i>you are his descendants.</i>

02:00:59.697 --> 02:01:03.663
<i>Never forget that</i>
 <i>you are his descendants.</i>

02:03:56.763 --> 02:03:58.230
My Shah went to heaven.

02:04:30.763 --> 02:04:35.630
Father? Where is my father?
Where is my father, brother?

02:04:39.663 --> 02:04:41.230
You have to be strong.

02:04:43.597 --> 02:04:45.597
Your father would’ve also wished for that.

02:06:00.497 --> 02:06:04.763
Let him, let him feel the pain of his
closest friend, Aykiz.

02:06:22.663 --> 02:06:23.663
Is it true?

02:07:21.797 --> 02:07:22.797
Ertugrul.

02:07:55.797 --> 02:07:57.563
My father died in peace.

02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:02.480
Any other way would not suit him,
anyhow.

02:08:08.647 --> 02:08:10.113
May he rest in peace.

02:08:13.213 --> 02:08:14.647
May God give you longevity.

02:08:16.913 --> 02:08:18.247
Before he died...

02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:21.980
...he asked us to go to Anatolia.

02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:27.013
A hard and painful life starts
once more, Halime.

02:08:27.513 --> 02:08:28.613
It is okay.

02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:32.880
Wherever you are
is my home, after all.

02:08:34.613 --> 02:08:37.113
And where my nomad group goes is
my homeland as well.

02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:40.213
May God keep you beside me.

02:09:01.847 --> 02:09:05.513
If God gives us a son,
we should name him Suleyman.

02:09:07.913 --> 02:09:10.313
For that blessed man's sacred memory.

02:10:29.013 --> 02:10:30.080
Bey.

02:10:32.347 --> 02:10:34.613
Your father tells me that
he died in peace.

02:10:39.247 --> 02:10:40.480
You are right, Wild Demir.

02:10:44.213 --> 02:10:45.213
He died in peace.

02:10:49.647 --> 02:10:55.180
God's and his loved ones' names
on his tongue, in peace.

02:11:00.613 --> 02:11:02.480
Where are we going to migrate, Bey?

02:11:06.647 --> 02:11:09.980
We will go to the path that Alparslan
cleared, Wild Demir.

02:11:12.947 --> 02:11:15.480
We can go to your father's grave and
say our prayers for him...

02:11:15.547 --> 02:11:17.447
...before the winter comes, can we not?

02:12:54.247 --> 02:12:55.247
Be seated.

02:13:13.147 --> 02:13:16.047
In the 99 names of almighty God,
who creates with his word...

02:13:16.513 --> 02:13:20.080
...and blesses our hearts with faith.

02:13:21.413 --> 02:13:24.213
In the name of the God.

02:13:33.313 --> 02:13:38.547
My Beys, my brave men,
supremes of my nomad group...

02:13:39.313 --> 02:13:42.013
...welcome, you bring grace to us.

02:13:42.113 --> 02:13:43.113
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

02:13:43.213 --> 02:13:44.247
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:53.247
Our Bey, Suleyman Shah, assigned me
as a substitute before he died.

02:13:55.147 --> 02:13:59.247
Now, we will determine
our nomad group's future...

02:13:59.347 --> 02:14:01.847
...without Suleyman Shah.

02:14:04.413 --> 02:14:06.947
We are relieved to hear that...

02:14:07.513 --> 02:14:12.313
...Suleyman Shah assigned you as
a substitute, Mother Hayme.

02:14:12.547 --> 02:14:16.513
Otherwise, we would now
be dealing with...

02:14:16.613 --> 02:14:18.013
...the Bey issue and be stumbling.

02:14:20.113 --> 02:14:23.047
Thank you, Wild Demir. Thank you.

02:14:25.913 --> 02:14:29.280
In the last discussion that we had
with Oghuz Beys, it was said that...

02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:32.313
...the Mongols were harassing Anatolia.

02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:38.313
Small Mongol units started running raids
in Anatolia lands.

02:14:39.647 --> 02:14:43.013
It is high time to stop this
flock of cruelty.

02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:50.247
What can we do when there are a thousand
Mongol for every Kayi, Mother Hayme?

02:14:52.647 --> 02:14:54.513
Not only us Kayis...

02:14:55.513 --> 02:14:59.613
...all the Oghuz nomad groups know that
this alliance is the last resort.

02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:06.280
For that, all the Oghuz nomad groups
will gather in Anatolia.

02:15:07.947 --> 02:15:12.147
If we do not stand up as one, and stand
tall...

02:15:12.913 --> 02:15:16.147
...if we keep bad blood between us...

02:15:16.847 --> 02:15:20.380
...we can only be the prey for those
jackal Mongols. Prey!

02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:32.480
That said,
it is still good to be cautious.

02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:38.180
As you know, we endured many hardships
and sufferings coming to Aleppo.

02:15:41.380 --> 02:15:43.313
As we are free from the crusaders...

02:15:43.513 --> 02:15:45.980
...why would we set off on
another journey, once again?

02:15:48.113 --> 02:15:49.113
Son.

02:15:51.313 --> 02:15:57.013
Suleyman Shah made an effort
to create this alliance.

02:15:59.213 --> 02:16:03.280
On one hand, there are crusaders
and on the other, there are Mongols.

02:16:04.213 --> 02:16:07.080
A new world order is
being set as a shameless...

02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:10.847
...ruthless and bloody order as it is.

02:16:11.947 --> 02:16:16.080
In this order, we need to be together,
either with the scared dogs...

02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:21.280
...or with the Alps who are standing tall.

02:16:26.047 --> 02:16:31.380
I say, in this mortal life,
let us go against the world!

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:37.647
Even if we know that only one of us
will stand in the end...

02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:41.113
...let us fight these tyrants.

02:16:49.647 --> 02:16:51.013
And I say...

02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:55.647
...it is high time to seek revenge
on the Mongols.

02:16:57.880 --> 02:17:04.080
They killed our children,
our mothers, our sisters.

02:17:05.013 --> 02:17:08.480
If we do not stand against them...

02:17:09.347 --> 02:17:11.647
...this world will not find peace.

02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:17.013
You are right, Wild Demir.

02:17:18.513 --> 02:17:22.313
Now, what do you say to
going back to the Anatolia lands...

02:17:23.947 --> 02:17:25.347
...that we came from, Beys?

02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:50.547
I do not wish to set off.

02:17:56.213 --> 02:17:59.347
However, headquarters
has reached a verdict...

02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:03.880
...and surely I must concur.

02:18:05.047 --> 02:18:06.047
Thank you.

02:18:06.613 --> 02:18:07.647
Thank you.

02:18:14.547 --> 02:18:19.147
Hit the drums.
It is time for us to set off on a journey.

02:18:20.613 --> 02:18:24.313
It is time to stop those Mongol bandits!

02:18:26.347 --> 02:18:28.180
May God help us all.

02:18:28.413 --> 02:18:29.413
Amen!

02:18:33.913 --> 02:18:38.913
Kayis set on the road
for the resurrection of Anatolia.

02:18:40.613 --> 02:18:47.180
As they set forth, history would change.

02:18:48.347 --> 02:18:54.880
As they set forth, cruelty would end
and justice would prevail.
