Episode 14 will start after 12:10 min

12:10.353 --> 12:13.353
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:15.092 --> 12:18.092
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:19.530 --> 12:22.530
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:49.039 --> 12:51.106
Glad to see you again, Shahzade.
Thank God.

12:54.172 --> 12:55.406
Thank you, Afsin bey.

12:59.939 --> 13:03.406
Yigit, I have some things
to talk about with Afsin Bey.

13:16.272 --> 13:19.206
Aren't you going to Halime Sultan's
wedding, my Shahzade?

13:19.272 --> 13:21.206
I will be there shortly, Afsin Bey.

13:32.672 --> 13:34.372
I would rather...

13:38.139 --> 13:40.139
...die a thousand times than be your wife.

13:41.672 --> 13:42.906
Halime?

13:48.539 --> 13:51.506
Halime? Halime?

14:06.506 --> 14:08.406
I am listening to you, my Shahzade.

14:13.372 --> 14:17.572
I have allied with El Aziz
as a Seljuk Shahzade.

14:19.506 --> 14:22.906
From now on, I am going
to struggle to get my share...

14:24.272 --> 14:25.539
....on the Seljuk State.

14:27.106 --> 14:31.372
If you do,
the Seljuk State would fall apart.

14:33.006 --> 14:37.139
The blood of brothers killing each other
would dirty the swords, my Shahzade.

14:38.139 --> 14:42.639
I have been living with the fear of
losing my children for years, Afsin.

14:45.239 --> 14:47.339
Now it is their turn to fear.

14:49.672 --> 14:51.006
My decision is clear.

14:52.306 --> 14:53.906
It is your decision, Shahzade.

14:56.706 --> 14:59.172
I would like to have you
on my side as well, Afsin.

14:59.372 --> 15:02.639
Let us make
the Seljuk State rise again, together.

15:04.006 --> 15:09.539
If you work with me, I will endow you
with anything you want from the state.

15:13.706 --> 15:17.306
You have also been running away
like a deranged man for years.

15:19.139 --> 15:20.906
I would be grateful, my Shahzade.

15:21.606 --> 15:23.939
Is there anything you want from me?

15:25.606 --> 15:29.406
I want you to deliver
a message to all the Turkish tribes.

15:32.072 --> 15:35.506
I will provide a fortune
to win their hearts.

15:37.106 --> 15:39.572
How are we going to find
that “fortune”, my Shahzade?

15:40.339 --> 15:43.072
El Aziz will provide
all the support he can.

15:44.472 --> 15:46.239
You shall take action now.

15:46.939 --> 15:48.939
I will send you a message.

15:49.972 --> 15:53.439
You can find me in the Turkmen carpet shop
in the Aleppo souk, my Shahzade.

15:54.706 --> 15:56.172
May you live long!

16:17.472 --> 16:21.039
You, the courageous
Beys of the Oghuz tribe!

16:22.339 --> 16:29.172
Are you going to rely on the words of this
villain or El Aziz the Ameer of Aleppo?

16:40.039 --> 16:43.272
This is all I have to say,
noble Beys of the Oghuz Tribe!

16:46.039 --> 16:48.472
The ones, who
infiltrated our nomad group, who are...

16:48.539 --> 16:51.206
...willing to transmit
the plague to our people...

16:51.939 --> 16:54.272
...and cause a fit among the
Islam world...

16:56.539 --> 17:00.672
...and are willing to prevent us
from praying in Jerusalem...

17:02.239 --> 17:05.172
...are now trying to subvert
the Seljuk State...

17:05.539 --> 17:08.272
...by setting the Oghuzs
against each other.

17:10.672 --> 17:17.672
This is such betrayal that it is beyond
comprehension for a man of honor.

17:18.672 --> 17:24.472
The most evident example of it
is standing right before you.

18:00.239 --> 18:02.639
This human piece of garbage...

18:03.139 --> 18:07.072
...to whom Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub's
grandsons commended their armies...

18:07.139 --> 18:10.039
...is standing right before you
as the Crusaders' bastard.

18:16.106 --> 18:19.272
The ones who believe
Ertugrul are mistaken and misguided.

18:20.506 --> 18:23.639
Those who resort to him
will pay a heavy price.

18:23.706 --> 18:25.372
Hey you the son of a bastard!

18:25.439 --> 18:28.139
Are we supposed to believe
the son of Suleyman Shah...

18:28.206 --> 18:30.972
...or someone as evil
and nondescript as you?

18:31.039 --> 18:36.139
Why should we believe the things you say
with that inauspicious face of yours?

18:39.239 --> 18:44.139
I see that you have set a trap for me,
together with your uncle Korkut.

19:24.506 --> 19:25.906
From now on...

19:26.706 --> 19:30.272
...the Kizil Kekelis
are the enemies of the Ayyubids!

19:31.506 --> 19:34.139
Those who betray
the Ameer of Aleppo El Aziz...

19:34.539 --> 19:36.472
...shall not leave here alive!

19:40.072 --> 19:41.406
Move!

19:44.139 --> 19:47.506
If he is the leader of the soldiers
who you trust the most...

19:49.339 --> 19:52.306
...you'd better replace them
with donkeys, Nasir!

20:10.906 --> 20:11.972
Brother!

20:12.039 --> 20:13.639
I cannot let her do this to me!

20:13.906 --> 20:15.472
Your Highness, stop, for God's sake!

20:15.606 --> 20:19.172
Don't do anything that you
will regret later!

20:29.339 --> 20:31.006
What are you doing here, Halime?

20:32.006 --> 20:34.106
You were supposed
to go to the hunting lodge.

20:35.039 --> 20:36.306
This matter is finished, father.

20:38.139 --> 20:39.472
There is no wedding!

20:41.639 --> 20:43.306
What are you saying, Halime?

20:44.539 --> 20:47.072
If you are going to carry
on with that treachery...

20:47.439 --> 20:49.606
...you will not be able
to abuse me, father.

20:52.039 --> 20:53.306
Halime, what have you done?

21:15.339 --> 21:16.639
Shame on you!

21:20.272 --> 21:21.906
You promised me!

21:24.506 --> 21:26.606
I have fulfilled every request you made.

21:29.106 --> 21:32.472
I have given you a dowry
no woman would ever receive.

21:33.339 --> 21:34.672
For what?

21:35.406 --> 21:36.706
For a little hope!

21:39.406 --> 21:41.939
For the hope that Halime Sultan might...

21:43.172 --> 21:44.939
...love me one day, if she pleased.

21:47.706 --> 21:49.072
But what did she do?

21:50.706 --> 21:53.206
She humiliated me in front of everybody!

21:55.672 --> 21:57.039
She degraded me!

21:59.372 --> 22:02.439
She trashed the Salah ad-Din
Yusuf ibn Ayyub's lineage!

22:03.206 --> 22:04.272
For what?

22:06.506 --> 22:09.006
For that goat shepherd named Ertugrul!

22:09.072 --> 22:10.639
-Brother!
-Leyla, shush!

22:15.906 --> 22:20.972
Shahzade, you will clean off
the shame you’ve covered my face with...

22:23.606 --> 22:26.006
...or you all will pay the price for it.

22:47.239 --> 22:49.106
KAYI NOMAD TENTS

23:02.406 --> 23:04.272
Take two of the best Alps with you.

23:04.639 --> 23:06.572
You will hit the road, armed with weapons.

23:07.139 --> 23:08.139
Aye, Bey!

23:08.439 --> 23:10.272
You will watch the Templars' castle.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.406
You will inform me about...

23:14.339 --> 23:17.272
...who gets in and out, even
about the birds that fly over it!

23:18.206 --> 23:19.906
There is no stopping from now on!

23:21.272 --> 23:25.939
Since they have waged a war against us,
we will loom over them like a dark shadow!

23:26.672 --> 23:27.939
Aye, Bey!

23:28.572 --> 23:34.572
Nobody will know about your mission
except you and the other two Alps.

23:36.239 --> 23:38.072
Pick the most close-mouthed ones.

24:10.939 --> 24:13.606
We saw a castle similar
to this one while we were in Alamut.

24:13.706 --> 24:15.606
But we did not have the chance to get in.

24:18.006 --> 24:19.406
We are meant to enter this one!

24:19.906 --> 24:23.206
You can get in, but I am not sure
if you will be able to get out alive.

24:23.506 --> 24:25.606
Let's hope for the best, Knight!

24:28.639 --> 24:32.372
You can speak our language
very well, where are you from, Knight?

24:32.939 --> 24:35.072
I am Saxon and also my mother is Breton.

24:37.439 --> 24:39.572
Ah, good!

24:54.006 --> 24:55.572
There is no cross tattoo on him!

24:58.306 --> 25:00.306
Neither a cross nor a crescent, brother!

25:01.639 --> 25:03.106
Who the hell are you?

25:18.539 --> 25:20.006
Did you take his ring out?

25:20.072 --> 25:21.172
Yes, Bey.

25:21.239 --> 25:25.106
-There was poison in it, like you said.
-But he has no tattoo on his head, Bey.

25:28.539 --> 25:30.039
If he is not a Crusader...

25:31.039 --> 25:32.972
...he must be someone else's stooge.

25:38.039 --> 25:39.039
Untie him.

26:05.206 --> 26:07.306
So we are alone together, Nasir.

26:31.539 --> 26:33.972
I will not allow you to kill yourself.

26:44.272 --> 26:45.939
What do you want to know?

26:52.706 --> 26:53.972
Nothing.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.972
I already know what I should know.

26:57.339 --> 26:59.272
Then what do you want from me?

27:00.506 --> 27:02.206
I will take you to the nomad tent.

27:07.639 --> 27:08.639
Just think.

27:09.272 --> 27:12.172
An army with one
commander captured by the Kayis...

27:12.706 --> 27:15.239
...and another one
taking shelter in the Kayis.

27:18.272 --> 27:20.339
Do you think they would be
able to go to war?

27:20.406 --> 27:21.639
You bastard!

27:29.139 --> 27:30.406
Dogan, Bamsi.

27:33.272 --> 27:34.406
Get him ready!

28:19.539 --> 28:20.672
Turgut.

28:22.706 --> 28:24.339
Move, Turk, this way!

28:36.606 --> 28:38.639
Sir, I have brought your guest.

28:39.072 --> 28:40.572
Welcome Kurdoglu!

28:41.372 --> 28:42.572
I am glad to be here.

28:42.639 --> 28:44.339
You must be the Master.

28:45.472 --> 28:48.339
God bless, everybody
can speak our language here.

28:48.606 --> 28:51.406
We had a conversation
with your knight during our trip...

28:51.472 --> 28:53.939
...even though he is not
as friendly as you are.

28:54.672 --> 28:58.672
Speaking the enemy's language
is the greatest weapon, Kurdoglu.

28:59.406 --> 29:00.906
Are we still enemies?

29:02.106 --> 29:06.306
We know how to embrace
everyone who collaborates with us.

29:07.339 --> 29:08.939
Even the Muslims?

29:10.172 --> 29:13.039
The shadow of the cross
upon which Jesus was crucified...

29:13.706 --> 29:18.339
...keeps us all cool in the fire
of our tormented lives, Kurdoglu.

29:19.539 --> 29:21.572
Who we are does not matter.

29:22.439 --> 29:26.072
What matters the most is that our
interests are aligned, don't you think so?

29:27.272 --> 29:30.306
Smart people have always
set my mind at ease.

29:31.272 --> 29:34.206
I had a very nice meal prepared for you.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.539
Since I know how your fine tastes are...

29:36.639 --> 29:39.139
...I could say that I had it
prepared especially for you.

29:39.906 --> 29:46.172
Titus overpraised your cuisine,
and especially your hospitality.

29:47.039 --> 29:48.039
Thank you.

29:48.706 --> 29:49.706
After you!

30:03.539 --> 30:04.672
Wow!

30:06.439 --> 30:09.106
This must be what it’s like
to be a great and wealthy person, huh?

30:10.139 --> 30:13.339
Every herd needs a shepherd, of course!

30:14.439 --> 30:17.272
Our herd cannot even
prepare a simple meal, Bey!

30:17.672 --> 30:19.706
They only know how to herd animals.

30:19.939 --> 30:22.906
Anything and everything
is about snarling at other men.

30:23.639 --> 30:26.172
This time they have gone too far.

30:27.306 --> 30:29.106
Aleaddin on one side...

30:29.239 --> 30:32.939
the Ayyubids on the other side,
the Crusaders on the other.

30:34.072 --> 30:37.506
It is all about two
impractical evils doing stupid things.

30:38.572 --> 30:41.072
Suleyman Shah and his son, Ertugrul.

30:42.372 --> 30:46.339
If somebody doesn’t
put them through the wringer...

30:47.506 --> 30:50.039
...too many heads will roll, Kurdoglu.

30:51.439 --> 30:53.506
Mostly from your nomad group.

31:00.206 --> 31:02.106
-Isadora.
-Uncle.

31:02.639 --> 31:04.206
I took your Aristotle book.

31:05.006 --> 31:06.039
Excuse me.

31:13.072 --> 31:15.606
She is a beautiful girl, isn't she?

31:20.039 --> 31:23.539
We can only say:
“May God grant her a happy marriage.”

31:31.106 --> 31:32.139
Mario?

31:33.339 --> 31:34.906
Good day, madam.

31:37.672 --> 31:40.139
How much longer are you
going to run away from me?

31:41.506 --> 31:44.506
Come to see me tomorrow morning.

32:34.172 --> 32:35.506
Eftelya?

32:35.572 --> 32:36.672
Titus.

32:47.606 --> 32:48.639
This...

32:49.139 --> 32:50.339
This is impossible!

32:52.672 --> 32:55.006
I saw your burnt body myself.

32:55.906 --> 32:58.372
Titus, you are underestimating me.

32:59.406 --> 33:01.472
That body you saw was not mine.

33:15.906 --> 33:17.039
Wear it!

33:30.672 --> 33:34.139
I know that El Aziz and Halime's
wedding plan went down the drain.

33:34.906 --> 33:37.472
So the Seljuk and the Ayyubid
war is just a dream now.

33:41.506 --> 33:45.106
Are you holding my arms, that you once
held with love, with anger now?

33:45.172 --> 33:48.139
I am not responsible for what
happened. Come to your senses!

33:53.439 --> 33:54.706
I am sorry, Eftelya.

33:56.239 --> 33:57.939
I did not mean to make you angry.

33:58.706 --> 34:02.072
There is only one person responsible
for the things that have happened.

34:02.406 --> 34:03.906
And that is Ertugrul!

34:07.239 --> 34:10.339
Ertugrul and Halime
are madly in love with each other.

34:11.406 --> 34:14.506
There can be two reasons
for a man's failure, Titus.

34:15.572 --> 34:18.605
The first is his uncontrollable
ambition, and the other is love.

34:19.972 --> 34:21.306
You still have a chance.

34:21.372 --> 34:24.539
If you can manage to abuse
the weak sides of those foolish lovers...

34:24.605 --> 34:26.539
...you will be able get what you want.

34:30.672 --> 34:31.972
Go to the castle.

34:32.406 --> 34:33.706
Lie low for some time.

34:35.339 --> 34:38.472
We will find a way to get you
into the palace when this is all over.

34:38.539 --> 34:39.939
What about Nasir?

34:40.006 --> 34:41.472
Huh, Nasir!

34:43.239 --> 34:45.272
He is busy with provoking the Turkmens...

34:45.406 --> 34:47.706
...into starting a riot
against Sultan Aleaddin.

34:48.972 --> 34:50.406
What are you going to do?

34:50.472 --> 34:52.206
This marriage will be solemnized.

34:53.572 --> 34:54.972
And Ertugrul will die.

34:56.706 --> 34:57.939
That is my job.

35:14.306 --> 35:16.706
I would have liked to serve you some wine.

35:17.572 --> 35:21.006
I am growing the grapes in my own
vineyard with my own fair hands.

35:21.939 --> 35:26.139
But I thought it would not be
appropriate because of your religion.

35:27.039 --> 35:28.072
Thank you.

35:32.072 --> 35:36.706
As I said earlier, I would have liked to
help your nomad group very much...

35:37.572 --> 35:41.239
...but I do not want to take El Aziz's
armies on without a cause.

35:42.472 --> 35:47.239
The only thing we all wish for
is just a little peace, isn't it?

35:50.506 --> 35:52.206
Aren't you going to help at all?

35:52.972 --> 35:58.372
I cannot help because the interests of
the Crusaders' world do not permit that.

35:59.906 --> 36:05.972
But we are both smart enough to get the
best out of this situation in the end...

36:06.039 --> 36:07.906
...don't you think so, Kurdoglu?

36:10.439 --> 36:11.672
How can that be?

36:15.639 --> 36:18.572
If you kill Suleyman Shah
and supersede....

36:20.106 --> 36:22.472
...you will not only get our support...

36:22.606 --> 36:26.506
but also the support of the
Crusaders' Principality of Antioch...

36:27.306 --> 36:31.106
...which is under our control,
the support of El Aziz's palace...

36:31.206 --> 36:33.172
...the support of everyone!

36:37.372 --> 36:40.472
I am not talking about
just moral support.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.306
The fertile grasslands...

36:50.239 --> 36:57.072
The loot you will receive
by raiding the orthodox infidels.

36:59.506 --> 37:01.306
You shall not be pushed for money.

37:07.172 --> 37:10.572
I would like you to find
new allies in your nomad group.

37:17.006 --> 37:20.972
Persuade them into being bewitched
by the gold and captivate them.

37:22.039 --> 37:23.506
A small gift for you.

37:27.939 --> 37:30.006
Any questions, Kurdoglu?

37:33.506 --> 37:35.472
The knight I saw in the courtyard.

37:37.006 --> 37:39.406
Isn't he Ertugrul's Alp, Turgut?

37:41.672 --> 37:43.706
We are calling him Judas now.

37:45.939 --> 37:49.372
When the right time comes and
he goes back to your nomad tent...

37:49.439 --> 37:52.172
...he will be your closest helper.

37:53.172 --> 37:55.039
And also my messenger.

38:09.239 --> 38:10.439
Judas.

38:38.372 --> 38:40.906
I am going to head out
for Konya immediately.

38:41.539 --> 38:44.172
I am going to tell Sultan Aleaddin
what has happened.

38:46.139 --> 38:49.272
Ertugrul, we shall not waste
our time here any longer.

38:49.339 --> 38:51.572
It is best to hit the road
as soon as possible.

38:53.939 --> 38:55.372
Keep an eye on him.

38:56.272 --> 38:58.506
Do not let him kill himself like Eftelya.

38:59.139 --> 39:00.206
Don’t worry, Bey.

39:02.406 --> 39:06.006
What if this pander quibbles
and tells his soldiers that it’s a lie...

39:06.239 --> 39:08.639
...when you take him to the nomad tent?

39:08.706 --> 39:11.439
As long as Nasir and Sahabettin
are in the nomad tent...

39:11.506 --> 39:14.539
...he would not have the courage
to sic his men on us, uncle.

39:16.072 --> 39:17.472
Will you hold him hostage?

39:18.139 --> 39:19.972
El Aziz will have to listen to us.

39:20.039 --> 39:22.306
El Aziz is such an inept man that...

39:23.572 --> 39:26.939
...he knows very well he cannot
rule the country without them.

39:30.072 --> 39:31.906
May God help us all!

39:32.572 --> 39:33.639
Amen.

39:55.106 --> 39:58.472
The entire palace is imprisoned by your
sorrow, Your Highness The Ameer.

39:59.572 --> 40:01.672
I’ve been badly betrayed, Ebu Hisham.

40:03.972 --> 40:05.006
Halime...

40:06.572 --> 40:08.106
...the woman I love...

40:10.272 --> 40:12.939
...humiliated me in front of everyone...

40:13.272 --> 40:15.106
...and abandoned the wedding.

40:17.306 --> 40:19.672
I do not know what to say,
Your Highness The Ameer.

40:22.072 --> 40:24.106
And you were so excited about it.

40:25.072 --> 40:28.439
You were going to go
to the hunting lodge...

40:29.472 --> 40:32.439
...and spend the sweetest
and happiest days of your life there.

40:34.206 --> 40:35.972
I cannot explain how sorry I am.

40:37.106 --> 40:41.372
So you say, Ebu Hisham,
I was destined to be unhappy!

40:44.172 --> 40:47.572
I wouldn't like to bore you on
a sad day like this, but perhaps...

40:48.572 --> 40:52.306
...if I told you something that
I have just learned, it might help.

40:59.572 --> 41:00.939
I am listening...

41:03.106 --> 41:06.306
If you take Halime Sultan
and head out for the hunting lodge...

41:07.639 --> 41:09.906
...I know that someone
will come after you.

41:12.206 --> 41:13.206
Ertugrul.

41:14.706 --> 41:16.272
How do you know that?

41:17.072 --> 41:18.472
Because of the secret visit...

41:19.272 --> 41:22.639
...that your sister and your nanny
made to my beloved merchant friend...

41:22.706 --> 41:24.206
...Your Highness The Ameer.

41:24.272 --> 41:26.206
Talk frankly, Ebu Hisham!

41:29.706 --> 41:31.206
Leyla and your nanny...

41:32.272 --> 41:35.506
...are meeting with
Ertugrul in Ephraim's shop.

41:36.306 --> 41:39.706
Ertugrul learns everything that is going
on in the palace from them.

41:40.039 --> 41:41.039
No.

41:45.339 --> 41:46.572
It is a lie, isn't it?

41:50.939 --> 41:52.572
Soldiers, come with me!

41:58.072 --> 42:01.106
Tell Commander Gunhan
not to wait any longer!

42:02.272 --> 42:04.672
I do not want to hear the name Kayi
any longer.

42:09.572 --> 42:13.406
Kill anyone who resists without pity.

42:14.506 --> 42:16.706
Are you still here? Hurry!

42:42.303 --> 42:44.103
I loved you as if you were my mother.

42:46.903 --> 42:49.003
You became Leyla's wet nurse.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.737
Your milk was so poisonous...

42:56.403 --> 42:58.203
...that you poisoned my sister as well.

42:59.170 --> 43:02.237
El Aziz, what kind of words
are those, son?

43:03.937 --> 43:06.503
The tricks you pulled behind my back
with my stupid sister...

43:08.337 --> 43:10.870
...your meeting with Ertugrul
in Ephraim's shop...

43:14.303 --> 43:16.137
I already know everything, nanny.

43:19.303 --> 43:21.070
-Brother!
-Brother?

43:25.003 --> 43:27.537
You will never ever get out
of this room, Leyla!

43:30.737 --> 43:32.203
And speaking of you, nanny...

43:33.970 --> 43:35.070
Guards!

43:44.770 --> 43:46.070
Take this woman...

43:47.770 --> 43:49.003
...and take her to the dungeon.

43:51.770 --> 43:53.470
She will not get out of there
till she dies.

43:54.270 --> 43:55.303
No!

43:57.303 --> 43:59.837
El Aziz, son, why are you doing
these to us?

44:01.237 --> 44:02.403
Take that woman.

44:03.803 --> 44:06.537
Brother, don't do it.

44:09.837 --> 44:12.370
Don't, please! Brother, don't do it.

44:13.270 --> 44:14.837
Don't do it.

44:15.003 --> 44:17.937
Brother! Please!

44:18.403 --> 44:19.470
Brother?

44:24.503 --> 44:25.837
Brother?

44:31.037 --> 44:33.103
I do not want to see your face again.

44:35.137 --> 44:36.403
Neither yours nor hers.

44:40.037 --> 44:42.037
You both are dead for me.

45:16.537 --> 45:17.737
Get ready.

45:19.203 --> 45:20.937
We are leaving, Halime Sultan.

45:21.937 --> 45:23.103
Where?

45:23.770 --> 45:27.303
As we have decided earlier,
to the hunting lodge.

45:31.270 --> 45:33.837
I am not going anywhere with you,
Your Highness The Ameer.

45:34.770 --> 45:36.037
You will.

45:37.237 --> 45:40.937
If you want to see your father
and brother again, you will.

45:44.137 --> 45:45.370
Odalisques!

45:50.037 --> 45:51.503
Help Halime Sultan to get ready.

45:53.203 --> 45:54.537
We are leaving tomorrow.

47:02.270 --> 47:03.503
Ertugrul Bey sent me.

47:05.503 --> 47:08.237
You should have said that before, son.
I had an awful fright.

47:08.403 --> 47:10.937
All right, Master Ephraim.
Forgive me if I have scared you.

47:12.903 --> 47:14.270
Oh love!

47:15.503 --> 47:17.103
It is love, son, I understand.

47:18.837 --> 47:20.137
Love conquers all.

47:20.470 --> 47:22.337
Leyla Sultan sent this note.

47:37.937 --> 47:39.537
Shall we take Ertugrul's Alp, sir?

47:40.337 --> 47:42.903
No, he will bring Ertugrul to us.

48:48.337 --> 48:51.370
Nothing will be the way
it used to be, father.

48:54.003 --> 48:57.303
With God's permission, everything
will be very good, daughter.

48:58.970 --> 49:02.803
Look, nawruz has arrived,
spring is everywhere.

49:04.037 --> 49:07.303
Our hopes will blossom, like life.

49:08.270 --> 49:10.337
Hopelessness does not suit us, daughter.

49:10.837 --> 49:14.170
By taking refuge in God,
it is our religious duty, our worship

49:14.303 --> 49:17.237
to start every day with
the rising sun like a spring bud.

49:24.270 --> 49:28.370
Dear Aykiz, my pale daughter.

49:30.303 --> 49:31.537
My pure daughter.

49:32.537 --> 49:36.803
If God permits, your destiny
shall be as beautiful as your face.

49:41.137 --> 49:42.837
<i>Permission to come in, Master Demir?</i>

49:43.803 --> 49:44.803
Come in.

49:53.870 --> 49:55.503
I came to see how she is.

49:58.070 --> 49:59.503
If you need anything...

50:00.870 --> 50:02.803
With God's permission,
my daughter is fine.

50:03.337 --> 50:06.903
Her wounds will heal soon.
But she is tired now.

50:07.337 --> 50:08.537
She shall rest, eh?

50:10.770 --> 50:14.903
I am sorry for everything, Master Demir.

50:17.203 --> 50:19.003
I would not want this to happen.

50:20.103 --> 50:24.037
I know, daughter. Your heart
is as pure as your face.

50:24.903 --> 50:28.537
God will call anyone who has sins
to account, I know that as well.

50:29.237 --> 50:30.370
There you go.

51:18.803 --> 51:19.803
Bey.

51:28.470 --> 51:30.103
If you say anything

51:30.537 --> 51:32.870
I will cut your tongue

51:33.203 --> 51:36.770
into pieces with my sword, Nasir.

51:38.037 --> 51:40.437
Walk!

52:18.037 --> 52:20.070
-Peace be upon you, father.
-Peace be upon you.

52:21.137 --> 52:25.137
And peace be upon you, lions.
Thank God you are here.

52:42.203 --> 52:44.103
How are things? Tell me.

52:46.303 --> 52:47.903
The plot thickens in Aleppo, father.

52:49.137 --> 52:51.770
El Aziz the Ameer of Aleppo is willing
to drag Halime Sultan's father

52:51.937 --> 52:54.870
Shahzade Numan into a war against
Sultan Aleaddin

52:54.970 --> 52:56.937
by marrying Halime Sultan.

52:58.137 --> 53:02.137
If this happens, the Seljuk State
which is our only hope

53:02.870 --> 53:04.737
would fall into the claws
of the grim reaper.

53:07.437 --> 53:09.170
We need to shield the Seljuk.

53:10.003 --> 53:11.537
We have spoilt their games
for now, father.

53:12.437 --> 53:14.903
-El Aziz will not be able to attack us.
-Why not?

53:15.837 --> 53:19.303
Nasir; El Aziz's commander and
the Templars' man at the same time.

53:19.970 --> 53:22.437
We have captured and brought him here.

53:27.137 --> 53:30.770
You made me happy. You made me proud.

53:32.003 --> 53:33.437
May God bless you in both worlds.

53:34.770 --> 53:37.403
Your unity and peace
shall not be destroyed.

53:38.237 --> 53:40.403
You shall be honored with
Halil Ibrahim's abundance.

53:44.203 --> 53:46.037
If we can manage to take
Halime Sultan from him...

53:48.503 --> 53:50.337
...we would put the Seljuk at ease.

53:53.370 --> 53:54.737
Bey.

53:55.770 --> 53:58.270
Where is my mother?
Where is my brother Dundar?

54:07.170 --> 54:08.903
Your brother Dundar...

54:11.770 --> 54:13.837
...is fighting with the grim reaper
inside.

54:30.803 --> 54:31.803
Mother?

54:34.070 --> 54:35.070
Mother?

54:36.203 --> 54:37.270
Mother?

54:45.070 --> 54:46.270
My lions!

54:47.737 --> 54:49.437
My lions are back.

54:50.070 --> 54:53.003
Thanks be to God!

54:54.837 --> 54:56.137
You came.

55:04.037 --> 55:06.303
-How is he?
-Akcakoca said

55:07.337 --> 55:10.103
"Where there is life there is hope!"

55:11.503 --> 55:15.303
But even if he recovers,
his mental skills...

55:28.303 --> 55:29.737
Who has done it?

55:30.737 --> 55:31.970
We do not know, son.

55:33.103 --> 55:36.170
When that merchant came to buy
our goods, what happened was...

55:36.237 --> 55:37.770
Ebu Hisham!

55:52.470 --> 55:55.403
The real name of the man who
you know as Ebu Hisham is Titus.

55:58.337 --> 56:01.837
A Templar Knight who has been chasing
me since I killed his brother Bisol.

56:08.837 --> 56:10.937
What happened is all my fault.

56:15.303 --> 56:16.537
Give me your blessings.

56:20.037 --> 56:21.437
It is the volition of God, son.

56:22.837 --> 56:24.270
The volition of God.

56:27.103 --> 56:29.737
Our chivalrous brother will recover,
if God permits.

56:32.203 --> 56:33.303
Son...

56:34.403 --> 56:37.103
...there is still a hope for Dundar.

56:39.003 --> 56:40.137
But...

56:43.737 --> 56:47.003
...we have another great anguish.

56:50.337 --> 56:51.403
What is it, mother?

56:54.103 --> 56:56.437
-Selcan.
-What happened to Selcan?

56:58.903 --> 57:02.270
Bride Selcan lost her baby.

57:17.003 --> 57:18.737
-Son!
-Gundogdu!

58:09.170 --> 58:10.370
Selcan?

58:14.270 --> 58:16.470
I could not be the wife
to give you a child.

58:17.237 --> 58:20.270
I disappointed you, hurt your pride.

58:25.470 --> 58:29.370
Come on, you do not say it.

58:30.303 --> 58:32.170
God is the giver and the taker.

58:33.470 --> 58:36.770
Come on, just tell me,
how did this happen?

58:41.437 --> 58:44.837
While we were practicing for the war
we have gone to because of your brother...

58:45.837 --> 58:49.403
...Wild Demir's Aykiz caused me
to have a miscarriage.

58:51.003 --> 58:54.537
I told you that Aleppo would do us
no good, Gundogdu.

58:55.903 --> 58:59.837
Talk frankly, woman.
Did Aykiz cause you to miscarry?

59:02.437 --> 59:04.970
She attacked me regardless
of my pregnancy.

59:05.370 --> 59:08.537
I found myself tumbling down without
realizing what had happened.

59:08.970 --> 59:10.437
She caused me to lose my baby.

59:13.870 --> 59:16.537
So I will burn their home down then.

59:18.037 --> 59:20.837
I beg you, do not do anything, Gundogdu!

59:25.770 --> 59:28.937
It will pass, daughter. It will.

59:30.070 --> 59:34.070
These bad days will pass,
these grieves will pass.

59:36.070 --> 59:41.870
Do not forget that, God Almighty
is the most merciful.

59:42.837 --> 59:48.803
And God Almighty is testing
our patience and resignation.

59:50.070 --> 59:52.803
And that shows that
he has not given up on us.

59:53.370 --> 59:57.503
May God protect us from the ones who
makes mischief and casts aspersions.

59:58.303 --> 59:59.903
<i>Permission to come in, Wild Demir?</i>

01:00:01.103 --> 01:00:02.370
Go ahead, Gundogdu.

01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:10.937
Aykiz!

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:14.370
The murderer of my unborn baby!

01:00:15.503 --> 01:00:17.803
What was your problem
with that innocent baby?

01:00:18.537 --> 01:00:21.003
We all were blind to your faults
just because you were in pain

01:00:21.137 --> 01:00:25.137
we ignored your foolish acts. But sooner
or later, you will pay the price for it.

01:00:25.237 --> 01:00:27.237
Manners, Bey's son, manners!

01:00:28.103 --> 01:00:31.170
You want to take a life?
An eye for an eye?

01:00:31.403 --> 01:00:33.003
Go ahead, kill me!

01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:39.537
But don't you ever forget that
your serpent-eyed wife...

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.370
...has cast aspersions on my daughter.

01:00:42.903 --> 01:00:45.870
What aspersions, Wild Demir?
What aspersions?

01:00:46.503 --> 01:00:49.537
Your daughter has no limits,
without measure.

01:00:50.103 --> 01:00:52.870
And what is more, she ruined my family!

01:00:53.837 --> 01:00:56.370
Sooner or later, she will pay
the price for it!

01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:28.370
Since you have been out to gather
information about the army

01:03:29.137 --> 01:03:31.770
I shall tell you the things
you should know.

01:03:32.737 --> 01:03:35.137
The army that El Aziz has sent
to the nomad tent

01:03:35.403 --> 01:03:38.370
consists of 3600 horsemen.

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:42.103
And together with the pedestrians
and the support forces

01:03:42.337 --> 01:03:44.470
the number is around 7000.

01:03:44.837 --> 01:03:48.937
And with your 2000 Alps, the difference
is beyond comparison.

01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:51.437
How do you know that?

01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:56.170
Do you think El Aziz's army would do
anything without my knowledge?

01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:54.037
What are you doing here? You traitor!

01:04:55.303 --> 01:04:56.837
Who is this man, Kurdoglu?

01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.737
He is one of Suleyman Shah's Alps.

01:05:01.737 --> 01:05:04.137
There were two Turks there,
now they do not exist.

01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:08.403
Did Suleyman Shah have you chased?

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:09.970
I do not think so.

01:05:10.837 --> 01:05:13.037
He must have sent him to watch the castle.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.403
It is better he did not return
to the nomad tent.

01:05:18.837 --> 01:05:20.070
No doubt.

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:25.937
How could you do this
to our Bey, Kurdoglu?

01:05:27.237 --> 01:05:28.503
Hell with your Bey!

01:05:29.103 --> 01:05:31.203
Whatever I have done, I have done it
for my nomad group.

01:05:36.537 --> 01:05:37.803
Turgut!

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:16.937
Welcome Claudius.

01:06:18.203 --> 01:06:20.370
His Holiness The Cardinal
is expecting you.

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:58.537
You have received the news I sent.
That is good.

01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:01.137
I was worried sick, Bey.
Where have you been?

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.937
Stash these gold away, Alpargo.

01:07:16.837 --> 01:07:18.103
Now the time has come.

01:08:12.203 --> 01:08:15.937
Your father told me not to come
but I could not help myself.

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:20.170
It is not your mistake, Gokce.
My father must have said it

01:08:20.237 --> 01:08:23.037
to prevent you from coming into
conflict with your sister.

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:25.837
What happened that day, Aykiz?

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:31.003
We started to rake over the old coals,
I do not know how.

01:08:33.737 --> 01:08:35.270
She mentioned your father.

01:08:36.837 --> 01:08:40.170
My father. Suleyman Shah.

01:08:43.103 --> 01:08:44.770
Is what they are telling true?

01:08:48.237 --> 01:08:52.537
When my father died,
was Suleyman Shah with him?

01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:54.403
He was.

01:08:57.337 --> 01:09:00.737
And also my father had gone into
combat to protect Suleyman Shah.

01:09:02.937 --> 01:09:04.203
That is how I heard.

01:09:05.337 --> 01:09:07.137
My father never talks about it.

01:09:11.237 --> 01:09:14.070
If my father had gone against...

01:09:15.337 --> 01:09:17.970
...the nomad group, the headquarters
and the Beys...

01:09:19.903 --> 01:09:21.970
...what had been done must be
what ought to be done.

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:25.370
May God forgive his sins.

01:09:29.503 --> 01:09:31.270
You are a good girl, Gokce.

01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:35.203
May God unite you with your loved ones.

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:38.103
You too, Aykiz.

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:44.337
I hope to see you in your bridal gown
in your wedding with Turgut.

01:09:47.137 --> 01:09:48.303
I will come back again.

01:10:14.203 --> 01:10:15.837
What are you saying, Kurdoglu?

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:19.470
How many days do you think
we can withstand

01:10:19.537 --> 01:10:21.237
if El Aziz's army attacks us tomorrow?

01:10:24.237 --> 01:10:28.270
For three days, we won't let them into
the emplacements we have prepared.

01:10:29.103 --> 01:10:30.270
On the fourth day...

01:10:31.803 --> 01:10:33.903
...they would pass over the emplacements
and the ambuscades.

01:10:34.937 --> 01:10:36.070
On the fifth day...

01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:42.170
...our children would be
at their commander's mercy.

01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:48.870
Even a single Alp's chance to stay alive
is not within the bounds of possibility.

01:10:53.903 --> 01:10:55.503
I would like to discuss the decision

01:10:55.837 --> 01:10:58.070
you have made with you
in the headquarters.

01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:00.870
What do we have to discuss?

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:05.237
Am I supposed to discuss cutting my son
Ertugrul's and Atabey Sahabettin's

01:11:05.370 --> 01:11:09.103
heads off and proffering with
my own hands, with my Beys?

01:11:10.837 --> 01:11:13.137
There is no harm in discussion, Bey.

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:15.937
Are not the headquarters
an Oghuz tradition?

01:11:16.737 --> 01:11:18.870
Are not the traditions the reasons
of our current situation?

01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:23.103
The headquarters is the embodiment
of the Oghuz tradition.

01:11:25.103 --> 01:11:28.303
Of course there is a price
to pay for our current situation.

01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:31.837
-And that price has to be paid.
-Enough!

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:37.537
What an impertinence!

01:11:41.803 --> 01:11:44.037
I am talking to you as an old friend...

01:11:44.937 --> 01:11:48.837
...a blood brother, Suleyman,
not the way as I would talk to my Bey.

01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:52.203
This matter is not about
me or you, Suleyman.

01:11:52.937 --> 01:11:54.970
It is about the future of our nomad group.

01:11:55.903 --> 01:11:57.137
Thousands of lives.

01:11:59.203 --> 01:12:01.937
I would like to discuss this matter
with you in the headquarters.

01:12:04.903 --> 01:12:07.003
If you gather the headquarters
after the friday prayer

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:08.370
we will discuss it.

01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:13.503
Now if you excuse me,
I would like to get some rest.

01:12:19.003 --> 01:12:20.370
Welcome, Ertugrul Bey.

01:12:29.903 --> 01:12:31.437
You wait for me inside, son.

01:12:32.303 --> 01:12:34.337
There is a matter
I would like to talk with you.

01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:10.970
I heard what you talked.

01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:14.937
What would you say
about this matter, wife?

01:13:17.737 --> 01:13:20.003
You have always looked for
the enemy outside, Bey.

01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:24.203
The enemy was among us.

01:13:25.503 --> 01:13:27.403
But you never wanted to see it.

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:48.037
I claimed a headquarters after
the friday prayer tomorrow.

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:51.103
The payback time with Suleyman
has already arrived.

01:13:53.403 --> 01:13:56.070
What will we do with so many gold?

01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:02.037
We will buy the nomad group's future,
Alpargo. The nomad group's future.

01:14:29.337 --> 01:14:31.436
I want to talk about my testament
with you.

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:35.337
You know that...

01:14:36.403 --> 01:14:39.837
...I do not own anything other than
my weapons and three or five animals.

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:44.470
We have not condescended
to anything on this world...

01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:48.436
...we have not gone after it, thank God.

01:14:52.337 --> 01:14:54.270
I didn't mean that.

01:14:55.503 --> 01:15:00.970
However we have too much on
our shoulders than we can achive.

01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:04.203
El Aziz's army may attack us anytime.

01:15:07.303 --> 01:15:09.870
And whether we will survive or not
tomorrow is uncertain.

01:15:11.803 --> 01:15:16.037
It is the ephemeral world,
the mortal world.

01:15:18.737 --> 01:15:23.403
As your father, I would like to bequeath
one of the millstones around my neck.

01:15:25.137 --> 01:15:27.737
Like I have bequeathed one of them
to your brother.

01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:32.303
I am talking about Gokce, son.

01:15:41.903 --> 01:15:43.370
I know about Halime Sultan also.

01:15:46.337 --> 01:15:50.370
Do not think I am ignoring
the fire within your heart.

01:15:52.103 --> 01:15:56.537
I also know every sacrifice you have made
for our nomad group.

01:15:57.870 --> 01:16:00.470
That Ertugrul I sent to Aleppo
is not before me.

01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:03.037
That Ertugrul has gone and

01:16:03.170 --> 01:16:05.870
the hero that will save the nomad group's
future has come instead of him.

01:16:07.103 --> 01:16:08.803
I also know this very well.

01:16:09.537 --> 01:16:10.770
Father...

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:17.303
The reason why I am not speaking about it
on these hard times is that.

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:22.537
If we can get rid of these troubles
and breathe easy...

01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:25.970
...you will marry Gokce, Ertugrul.

01:16:32.903 --> 01:16:36.037
Gokce is no longer your sister,
she is your wife.

01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:41.937
If I die...

01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:45.037
...I bequeath Gokce to you.

01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:14.170
<i>Oh God, make my dreams come true.</i>

01:20:39.937 --> 01:20:41.837
Put your dagger back in its sheath, uncle.

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:43.470
Your time has not come yet.

01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:57.403
But, it is about to...

01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:59.937
...do not worry.

01:21:00.903 --> 01:21:02.770
What time is that, nephew?

01:21:08.770 --> 01:21:10.337
Till things are exposed...

01:21:12.437 --> 01:21:14.437
...till you are unable to find
a place to hide...

01:21:15.903 --> 01:21:18.903
...you are safe till your sins
shine your shadow.

01:21:22.903 --> 01:21:27.303
Till that time you can cower behind
my father's friendly shadow easily.

01:21:30.137 --> 01:21:31.303
But...

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:34.270
...I have my eyes on you, you should know.

01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:41.337
If you think I would let you dig a pit
for us, then you are mistaken, uncle.

01:21:42.737 --> 01:21:44.903
Do not think you took becoming
the Bey for granted

01:21:45.037 --> 01:21:48.337
just because you have managed to bring
El Aziz's commander to the nomad tent.

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:50.503
Tomorrow is another day.

01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:53.837
Of course someone will know
about the things you have done

01:21:53.937 --> 01:21:55.237
and call to account.

01:21:56.003 --> 01:21:58.037
And you know that in our tradition

01:21:58.137 --> 01:22:02.137
it has no importance what or who
you are to become the Bey.

01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:07.303
Even if you marry the Shahzade's daughter
and bring her to the nomad tent

01:22:07.403 --> 01:22:09.470
this does not make way
to the marquee for you.

01:22:10.037 --> 01:22:13.737
You should know that I am not inclined
to become the Bey, Kurdoglu.

01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:18.137
There are so many men who would not
drag the nomad group

01:22:18.537 --> 01:22:22.903
into endless adventures and
let them go astray, Ertugrul.

01:22:23.737 --> 01:22:27.037
They would not opt for the adventurers
like you, even if you wanted them to.

01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:29.537
Especially when there are

01:22:30.003 --> 01:22:32.970
decent Bey candidates like Gundogdu
in the nomad group.

01:22:33.837 --> 01:22:37.470
And you, Kurdoglu?
Are you planning to become the Bey

01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:41.303
by falling into the arms of that infidel
who introduces himself as Ebu Hisham?

01:22:44.303 --> 01:22:47.337
I know there are so many people

01:22:47.403 --> 01:22:49.870
that respect the men who stab people
in the back like yourself.

01:22:50.537 --> 01:22:54.870
But my brother is not one of them.

01:23:00.502 --> 01:23:04.235
Do not ever think that I do not know
what you are planning...

01:23:04.302 --> 01:23:08.202
...with your uncanny friends
just like you.

01:23:11.335 --> 01:23:15.902
I know what you have been doing
since the day you went to Aleppo.

01:23:16.502 --> 01:23:17.935
However...

01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:20.702
...I do not have the proof for them.

01:23:21.402 --> 01:23:26.202
My life is yours the very day
you find that proof, Ertugrul.

01:23:26.902 --> 01:23:31.535
But if you cannot,
I will make you pay for these defamations.

01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:38.602
Delusions and baseless defamations
all the time.

01:23:42.169 --> 01:23:44.602
I do not know if I should get mad at you.

01:23:44.702 --> 01:23:49.502
Whether I should beat you up
like I did when you were a little boy.

01:23:50.435 --> 01:23:53.402
What am I going to do with you, Ertugrul?

01:23:53.469 --> 01:23:56.302
Nothing, Uncle. Nothing.

01:23:57.202 --> 01:24:01.369
But I know very well
what I am going to do with you.

01:24:02.702 --> 01:24:05.369
You will see it when the day comes, Uncle.

01:24:34.902 --> 01:24:37.169
My son...

01:24:53.235 --> 01:24:55.802
One of my brothers is in his deathbed...

01:24:56.335 --> 01:24:59.602
...and my other brother is
God knows where.

01:25:03.402 --> 01:25:06.669
One of my brothers is in sorrow
for losing his child.

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:09.702
And I am wounded.

01:25:12.935 --> 01:25:16.969
The troubles of this pavilion
never come to an end, Mother.

01:25:17.202 --> 01:25:20.202
You have such an indestructible sorrow.

01:25:22.802 --> 01:25:27.302
They would talk bad about us
if we got over these troubles.

01:25:29.169 --> 01:25:32.569
If we cry on the inside,
but laugh on the outside...

01:25:32.635 --> 01:25:35.202
...the evil eyes wouldn't leave us alone.

01:25:35.269 --> 01:25:39.635
One who gets in the Lord's pavilion once,
seeks salvation in death.

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:44.969
What can we do?
This is our destiny, son.

01:25:45.935 --> 01:25:47.602
What about my destiny?

01:25:49.769 --> 01:25:54.169
My heart goes towards its loved one
who is from the Kinik tribe...

01:25:54.235 --> 01:25:57.835
...like a galloping rider on his horse.

01:26:01.202 --> 01:26:06.169
However, our father, our lord...

01:26:07.535 --> 01:26:11.169
...sees fit the hazel eyed girl
from the Kayi tribe.

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:18.269
The horse that lies in my heart
has only one saddle, mother.

01:26:28.802 --> 01:26:32.802
When the lord speaks,
when the father speaks...

01:26:34.169 --> 01:26:36.702
...the young one should only obey.

01:26:36.902 --> 01:26:42.469
When you become a lord, your heart
should be as big as your pavilion.

01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:47.235
If the horse that lies in your heart
has a saddle...

01:26:47.935 --> 01:26:51.969
...you should sit on it yourself,
not your woman.

01:26:57.802 --> 01:27:03.469
If what your heart says,
and what your brain says...

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:06.535
...really love you...

01:27:09.735 --> 01:27:12.902
...they will certainly
come to you together.

01:27:14.569 --> 01:27:16.535
What are you saying, mother?

01:27:17.535 --> 01:27:19.869
You were the one who said...

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:24.569
..."Should the place where you lean on
wear off and come apart?

01:27:24.635 --> 01:27:26.769
Even a wild animal is hairy.

01:27:27.702 --> 01:27:30.535
One should only have one spouse."

01:27:32.335 --> 01:27:34.735
Ertugrul Bey, can I come in?

01:27:54.935 --> 01:27:57.535
I had Ilyas Fakih read this, my Lord.

01:27:58.869 --> 01:28:00.669
What does it say?

01:28:01.235 --> 01:28:02.702
El Aziz.

01:28:04.369 --> 01:28:07.569
He is taking Halime Sultan
to the hunting lodge.

01:28:08.302 --> 01:28:11.502
However, they have not gotten married yet.

01:28:11.569 --> 01:28:14.235
El Aziz is taking her there by force.

01:28:20.602 --> 01:28:21.835
My Lord...

01:28:23.269 --> 01:28:24.835
Dogan, what is it, son?

01:28:24.902 --> 01:28:26.669
Mother Hayme...

01:28:27.202 --> 01:28:28.569
...Ertugrul Bey...

01:28:29.902 --> 01:28:31.569
...has gone.

01:28:31.635 --> 01:28:33.502
Gone where?

01:28:35.535 --> 01:28:37.935
To bring Halime Sultan back.

01:30:22.202 --> 01:30:23.869
My Lord...

01:30:23.969 --> 01:30:27.535
Please let us come with you.

01:30:30.435 --> 01:30:33.735
It is not ready, my Lord.
It has not been fixed yet.

01:30:33.802 --> 01:30:35.869
It will do the job, Bamsi.

01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:39.602
I will go alone.

01:30:39.702 --> 01:30:41.535
The war is at the door.

01:30:42.402 --> 01:30:44.835
The tent should not be left alone.

01:30:49.469 --> 01:30:51.835
My Lord...

01:31:00.202 --> 01:31:02.202
Thank you, brother.

01:31:03.569 --> 01:31:05.969
What the hell are we going to do now?

01:31:29.435 --> 01:31:30.702
My Shah...

01:31:33.169 --> 01:31:35.602
I was wondering if you need anything.

01:31:42.902 --> 01:31:44.435
No, my girl.

01:32:02.635 --> 01:32:04.602
Have a good night, my girl.

01:32:30.735 --> 01:32:33.335
I just wanted to say good night,
Hayme Anne.

01:32:33.402 --> 01:32:35.735
You too, my girl.

01:32:56.835 --> 01:32:59.869
You were going to ask Ertugrul,
weren't you?

01:33:03.202 --> 01:33:05.469
Come on, let's have a seat.

01:33:16.735 --> 01:33:19.469
Ertugrul went to bring Halime back.

01:33:39.469 --> 01:33:40.969
I am leaving, Dogan.

01:33:42.369 --> 01:33:47.369
Where are you going? Our Lord said this
was for him to do and told us to sit here.

01:33:47.535 --> 01:33:51.202
No, brother.
My butt hurts after all that sitting down.

01:33:55.935 --> 01:33:58.235
I will tell him you urged me to do it.

01:33:58.302 --> 01:34:00.702
So, you would sell me out just like that.

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:05.535
You are like a well-fed suckling veal.
I would sell you in the market.

01:34:05.602 --> 01:34:10.169
Get out of the way, infidels!
We are going to bring Halime Baci back.

01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:20.235
You love him, don't you?

01:34:20.635 --> 01:34:22.402
Yes, mother.

01:34:24.335 --> 01:34:27.435
I have been loving him
since my childhood.

01:34:28.369 --> 01:34:33.169
Your sister Selcan
has brought this up first.

01:34:35.902 --> 01:34:38.802
And I have told it to Suleyman Shah.

01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:42.202
I know, mother.

01:34:44.735 --> 01:34:49.635
So, tell me,
what if this had never been brought up?

01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:53.602
Then it would never be brought up again.

01:34:53.702 --> 01:34:56.602
I would live on with my untold love.

01:34:58.735 --> 01:35:04.302
Who knows, maybe I would have
gotten married with another man.

01:35:05.735 --> 01:35:07.802
I would have another life.

01:35:10.169 --> 01:35:11.969
What about now?

01:35:12.202 --> 01:35:14.935
Is another man possible now, mother?

01:35:23.769 --> 01:35:27.769
If you really love Ertugrul...

01:35:27.869 --> 01:35:30.502
...would you do anything for him?

01:35:31.535 --> 01:35:32.869
I would, mother.

01:35:38.369 --> 01:35:40.169
So...

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:45.735
...you could afford forgetting him,
wouldn't you?

01:37:25.402 --> 01:37:26.702
Mario?

01:37:54.569 --> 01:37:58.402
What was the thing
you wanted to talk me about?

01:37:58.469 --> 01:38:00.369
Mario, say something.

01:38:00.635 --> 01:38:02.502
Forgive me, my girl.

01:38:02.569 --> 01:38:05.369
I committed a very big sin.

01:38:05.435 --> 01:38:07.635
I cannot carry this burden anymore.

01:38:07.702 --> 01:38:09.935
That is enough. Just tell me.

01:38:13.369 --> 01:38:15.502
Your father is alive, my girl.

01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:25.702
It all started when
Ibn al Arabi lured him away.

01:38:26.902 --> 01:38:30.535
When he abandoned our religion
and became a Muslim.

01:38:38.769 --> 01:38:41.935
Cardinal, his majesty,
please tell me...

01:38:42.169 --> 01:38:46.169
...when my hands
are all covered with blood like this...

01:38:46.469 --> 01:38:51.202
...will our Father Almighty
accept me to his kingdom?

01:38:52.569 --> 01:38:57.669
I lost Jesus' words and mercy
in my heart.

01:39:00.502 --> 01:39:02.369
I am afraid.

01:39:05.402 --> 01:39:12.402
Isn't the blood on your hands for watering
the flowers in God's kingdom, Claudius?

01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:17.435
The blood which turns
God's kingdom into heaven.

01:39:17.569 --> 01:39:20.835
The blood which
spells the death of infidels.

01:39:20.902 --> 01:39:25.169
I cannot forget
the screams of the innocent women...

01:39:25.302 --> 01:39:28.635
...and children I have killed, Cardinal.

01:39:29.302 --> 01:39:31.202
I cannot sleep at nights.

01:39:31.502 --> 01:39:35.869
Whenever I close my eyes,
I wake up with those screams.

01:39:37.369 --> 01:39:39.169
Nightmares...

01:39:40.335 --> 01:39:42.902
Pangs of conscience that never stop.

01:39:43.802 --> 01:39:47.302
I am begging you, set me free.

01:39:48.202 --> 01:39:54.435
Allow me to go to a chapel
and live as a monk for life.

01:39:55.869 --> 01:39:59.535
Yes, I have promised you,
have I not?

01:39:59.602 --> 01:40:01.602
I was going to set you free.

01:40:02.535 --> 01:40:06.702
However, I have one more request
from you, Claudius.

01:40:07.769 --> 01:40:10.635
I will do whatever you ask, sir.

01:40:11.469 --> 01:40:14.335
I found where Ibn al Arabi is.

01:40:14.402 --> 01:40:18.302
I want you to kill him
and take the relic in his ark.

01:40:19.335 --> 01:40:25.635
Your biggest enemy while doing this
will be Ustad Fetitus.

01:40:26.535 --> 01:40:32.269
Be careful, only the two of us know this.
This will be our secret.

01:40:33.469 --> 01:40:37.302
Yes, Cardinal, Your Majesty.

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:44.835
God forgive your sins, my child.

01:40:55.235 --> 01:40:57.902
They will eventually be punished.

01:41:00.669 --> 01:41:04.669
Please God Almighty, punish them now.

01:41:07.969 --> 01:41:10.569
Hear our prayers, God.
Hear them.

01:41:24.469 --> 01:41:26.502
Sir...

01:41:26.702 --> 01:41:30.335
...Nasir has slaughtered
all our dervishes brutally.

01:41:30.402 --> 01:41:33.335
Does a Muslim man
persecute another Muslim man?

01:41:33.402 --> 01:41:37.835
We curse him day and night,
and that is all we can do.

01:41:41.369 --> 01:41:44.669
A Muslim man
never persecutes another Muslim man.

01:41:45.835 --> 01:41:48.835
He never attempts against life unjustly.

01:41:50.802 --> 01:41:56.569
However, we will not let persecution
plant seeds of hate in our hearts.

01:41:57.869 --> 01:42:01.335
We will protect ourselves
from being persecutors.

01:42:05.269 --> 01:42:09.535
When a tribe requested somebody...

01:42:10.635 --> 01:42:13.702
...to tell them about Islam...

01:42:14.702 --> 01:42:17.502
...our Prophet, very lovingly...

01:42:17.569 --> 01:42:19.969
Peace be upon him.

01:42:20.235 --> 01:42:24.235
...sent 70 young men to that town
to tell them about Islam.

01:42:26.469 --> 01:42:29.702
While Medina was waiting for good news...

01:42:29.969 --> 01:42:32.635
...they received the worst news.

01:42:33.635 --> 01:42:36.935
Lightnings stroke
from the skies down to the city.

01:42:37.502 --> 01:42:39.769
Each household was in fire.

01:42:40.535 --> 01:42:44.769
Those 70 men that our Prophet sent...

01:42:45.602 --> 01:42:50.735
...were martyred in an ambush
that took place in Bir Maona.

01:42:52.435 --> 01:42:56.969
Our Prophet was very saddened after that.

01:42:58.169 --> 01:43:00.769
Anas Ibn Malik says that...

01:43:00.869 --> 01:43:05.435
...our Prophet had never been
more saddened in any other incident.

01:43:06.602 --> 01:43:12.802
He cursed those cruel infidels
after the morning prayer for a while.

01:43:15.435 --> 01:43:17.435
What happened after that?

01:43:24.169 --> 01:43:28.602
After that,
this verse from the Quran was disclosed:

01:43:29.902 --> 01:43:36.802
"And We have revealed you
only as grace to the worlds !"

01:43:43.269 --> 01:43:46.835
Our Prophet stopped cursing them
after this verse.

01:43:49.402 --> 01:43:52.735
He did not even curse the infidels.

01:43:55.202 --> 01:44:00.635
We will not curse any Muslim,
even if they are sinners and tyrants.

01:44:01.635 --> 01:44:07.502
We will not fill our hearts
with grudge and hatred.

01:44:08.402 --> 01:44:10.169
We will be cautious.

01:44:11.202 --> 01:44:14.635
We will prevent persecution
with our full strength.

01:44:15.769 --> 01:44:20.469
However, we will not let persecution
to turn us into persecutors.

01:44:21.569 --> 01:44:24.902
We will not let the devil
settle into our hearts.

01:44:46.769 --> 01:44:50.435
Sir, you always say
everything happens for a reason.

01:44:50.902 --> 01:44:52.902
What is the reason of all this?

01:44:52.969 --> 01:44:57.435
What is the reason for an innocent person
getting killed?

01:44:57.569 --> 01:45:01.969
My son, yes,
everything happens for a reason.

01:45:03.702 --> 01:45:07.969
The reason for a person
being martyred under persecution...

01:45:08.235 --> 01:45:12.235
...is for him to not die as a persecutor.

01:45:12.769 --> 01:45:16.569
To be persecuted and weakened
is not a shame for a Muslim.

01:45:16.635 --> 01:45:20.235
The only two things that devastate
a man in both worlds...

01:45:20.369 --> 01:45:22.269
...are persecution and betrayal.

01:45:24.835 --> 01:45:29.569
Thank God for protecting our brothers
from being persecutors.

01:45:29.635 --> 01:45:31.169
Thank God.

01:45:56.302 --> 01:46:02.402
The state is under duress
as long as Numan lives, Afsin.

01:46:02.969 --> 01:46:05.269
What are we going to do now?

01:46:06.369 --> 01:46:10.235
You had to kill both Numan and Yigit.

01:46:11.402 --> 01:46:12.869
You were weak.

01:46:15.502 --> 01:46:20.202
Listen, Afsin.
I know what you feel about Shahzades.

01:46:20.802 --> 01:46:23.602
But we do not have any choice.

01:46:24.202 --> 01:46:27.735
If we do, tell me
and we will act accordingly.

01:46:29.269 --> 01:46:33.169
When the fire of power glows once...

01:46:35.602 --> 01:46:39.169
...the only way to put it out...

01:46:39.269 --> 01:46:42.435
...is the spilling blood in streams.

01:46:45.935 --> 01:46:48.969
May God forgive their sins.

01:47:02.202 --> 01:47:05.569
We have been travelling
through all those places.

01:47:05.669 --> 01:47:07.835
For what, gentlemen?

01:47:07.935 --> 01:47:12.469
For our sons and our daughters
to be happy.

01:47:14.902 --> 01:47:17.935
For our goats and sheep to strengthen.

01:47:19.635 --> 01:47:24.735
We have been having trouble
for such a long time...

01:47:24.802 --> 01:47:27.502
...instead of finding peace.

01:47:27.602 --> 01:47:28.835
But, for what?

01:47:28.902 --> 01:47:30.902
For what?

01:47:31.369 --> 01:47:35.369
Our Lord's children
are bringing trouble after trouble...

01:47:35.435 --> 01:47:38.669
...instead of reuniting our tent.

01:47:47.602 --> 01:47:51.402
We saved ourselves
from Kara Toygar and came to this land.

01:47:51.502 --> 01:47:54.735
And now we are besieged by enemies
from all sides.

01:47:54.802 --> 01:48:01.269
We bring the fire into the tent instead of
evading the trouble, Suleyman Shah.

01:48:06.235 --> 01:48:08.335
Gentlemen...

01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:10.835
The higher people of my tent.

01:48:12.335 --> 01:48:17.169
I see that you are tired of
our struggle to death.

01:48:19.602 --> 01:48:23.935
And you are scared of the enemy.

01:48:26.769 --> 01:48:29.702
What was our pact with each other...

01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:34.469
...before leaving the
great mountains of Otukan?

01:48:38.769 --> 01:48:42.169
We were not going to give up...

01:48:42.735 --> 01:48:47.535
...even if the enemy
came for us like a dragon!

01:48:49.535 --> 01:48:51.669
Wasn't this our pact?

01:48:58.769 --> 01:49:00.902
But I see that you gave up!

01:49:03.702 --> 01:49:05.869
I see that you are scared!

01:49:07.835 --> 01:49:12.169
How can I trust you
in a battle after this?

01:49:21.602 --> 01:49:26.935
How can I give you weapons
and send you to battle?

01:49:32.902 --> 01:49:34.802
What kind of state is this?

01:49:34.869 --> 01:49:36.535
My Lord...

01:49:40.169 --> 01:49:44.569
We forgot neither the promise we gave
in Otukan nor how to fight.

01:49:46.169 --> 01:49:49.469
However, you and your children...

01:49:49.569 --> 01:49:52.335
...forgot the nobleness of this beylic.

01:49:54.935 --> 01:49:56.535
You fool!

01:49:57.402 --> 01:49:59.269
And your friends.

01:50:00.335 --> 01:50:03.835
A child is a father's essence.

01:50:04.435 --> 01:50:09.902
A lion from a lion,
and a jackal from a jackal.

01:50:11.635 --> 01:50:15.369
Know your place!
Just know  your place!

01:50:24.869 --> 01:50:27.702
My Lord, there is a messenger.

01:50:27.969 --> 01:50:30.769
Let him in.

01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:47.435
Suleyman...

01:50:48.435 --> 01:50:50.235
The time has come.

01:50:51.869 --> 01:50:54.902
El Aziz has decided
to destroy your tent.

01:51:05.835 --> 01:51:10.535
As a Oghuz Turk, I came here
to warn you for the last time.

01:51:11.602 --> 01:51:14.635
Turn Ertugrul and Sahabettin
over to us.

01:51:24.602 --> 01:51:29.469
I would give you my life
even if you came to us like rain.

01:51:30.502 --> 01:51:33.769
But I would never give you
even a baby goat from my tent.

01:51:33.835 --> 01:51:36.235
Enough is enough, my Lord!

01:51:38.269 --> 01:51:39.735
Enough.

01:51:45.935 --> 01:51:49.235
You do the opposite of what we want.

01:51:49.969 --> 01:51:52.802
You cannot throw the tent
into the fire for the jackals.

01:51:52.869 --> 01:51:55.235
Kurdoglu!

01:51:55.469 --> 01:51:58.535
I will take your head myself, Suleyman!

01:51:58.969 --> 01:52:00.602
Commander!

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:25.435
Protect your own heads first.

01:52:27.769 --> 01:52:29.802
What is this, Commander?

01:52:33.202 --> 01:52:37.302
You should learn how to talk to
Suleyman Shah first.

01:52:41.835 --> 01:52:45.702
If you talk without permission
in the Kayi tent...

01:52:45.769 --> 01:52:48.302
...I will take your head first.

01:52:53.802 --> 01:52:56.769
Now, go and tell El Aziz that...

01:52:56.869 --> 01:53:00.202
...if he wants Sahabettin
and my brother Ertugrul...

01:53:00.302 --> 01:53:03.635
...he should come and take them himself.

01:53:12.435 --> 01:53:15.502
Now, take your men and go.

01:53:16.435 --> 01:53:18.169
Or...

01:53:18.235 --> 01:53:21.769
...I will hand this man's head
over to you.

01:53:21.869 --> 01:53:25.369
Nobody in Aleppo would respect you, then.

01:53:27.935 --> 01:53:29.535
Come on!

01:54:10.535 --> 01:54:12.902
What are these, Shahzade?

01:54:16.235 --> 01:54:19.502
You will deliver this gold...

01:54:19.569 --> 01:54:23.702
...to all the Turkmen tents, Afsin Bey.

01:54:25.469 --> 01:54:29.569
Just for them to understand
what they achieved...

01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:33.202
...by being together with
Shahzade Numan.

01:54:34.702 --> 01:54:38.769
What if they do not want
to be together with you, Shahzade?

01:54:42.735 --> 01:54:45.602
They will, Afsin. They will.

01:54:48.335 --> 01:54:50.969
This is our only way.

01:54:51.269 --> 01:54:55.602
It is your duty to convince them
from now on.

01:54:57.735 --> 01:55:01.535
Is this your final decision, Shahzade?

01:55:06.735 --> 01:55:08.735
Yes, Afsin Bey.

01:55:13.202 --> 01:55:15.302
Come here.

01:56:00.269 --> 01:56:01.702
Traitor!

01:56:02.502 --> 01:56:04.502
Shahzade Numan...

01:56:06.769 --> 01:56:10.502
...the state will not forgive this.

01:56:12.935 --> 01:56:18.802
The state hates the one
who obeys to others.

01:56:22.935 --> 01:56:29.269
The state does not accept the one
who tries to ascend the throne with greed!

01:56:31.502 --> 01:56:36.769
The state gave this task
to Sultan Alaaddin. And he is the sultan!

01:57:10.935 --> 01:57:12.502
God...

01:57:21.869 --> 01:57:24.869
<i>Ertugrul, my father</i>
 <i>is forcing me to marry El Aziz.</i>

01:57:24.935 --> 01:57:27.369
If you take me from El Aziz' hands...

01:57:27.469 --> 01:57:30.502
...his rage will destroy
the whole Kayi tent.

01:57:30.769 --> 01:57:34.302
But I will not marry him
no matter what it takes.

01:57:34.569 --> 01:57:37.835
I will wait for you
until you come and rescue me.

01:57:37.902 --> 01:57:41.635
If I do not, you should know that
the angel of death has taken my soul.

01:57:41.702 --> 01:57:43.802
Then you should know that
I am also dead.

01:58:13.802 --> 01:58:16.469
What did I do to deserve this?

01:58:18.335 --> 01:58:20.769
I only loved you in the whole world.

01:58:20.869 --> 01:58:23.535
I brought the whole world to you.

01:58:27.902 --> 01:58:30.602
I gave your father his dignity back.

01:58:31.569 --> 01:58:36.735
Didn't I rescue your brother from the
Templars and bring him back to you?

01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:42.802
I gave you my live, I gave you my love,
I gave you everything I had.

01:58:44.235 --> 01:58:45.735
And what about you?

01:58:46.602 --> 01:58:48.869
What did you do, Halime Sultan?

01:58:51.235 --> 01:58:54.302
You walked over me
as if I was a snake.

02:00:03.435 --> 02:00:07.835
I never gave you hope.

02:00:08.335 --> 02:00:11.602
I never said a word
to give solace to you.

02:00:11.702 --> 02:00:16.335
At least, do not lie
to the man you walked over.

02:00:17.569 --> 02:00:20.835
You said you would marry me
if I brought your brother to you.

02:00:20.969 --> 02:00:25.169
It was the Templars who kidnapped him
who brought him back.

02:00:25.302 --> 02:00:29.569
And they brought you into a fire which
would threaten the whole Islamic world.

02:00:29.635 --> 02:00:32.202
Come on, Halime Sultan.

02:00:32.269 --> 02:00:37.202
I have not read these kinds of devilish
games even in "1001 Arabian Nights".

02:00:40.702 --> 02:00:44.435
Do you know what the biggest trick
of the Devil is?

02:00:44.502 --> 02:00:48.669
He tricks the ones
who he chooses as servants.

02:00:49.169 --> 02:00:51.635
And what is this trick, Halime Sultan?

02:00:53.235 --> 02:00:57.735
He makes his servants see themselves as
angels when they look into the mirror.

02:00:57.835 --> 02:01:01.469
Innocent, wronged, good-hearted.

02:01:03.502 --> 02:01:06.569
Whereas they are
the biggest servants of the devil.

02:01:06.669 --> 02:01:13.402
They are so arrogant that
they see the hellfire as a cool oasis.

02:01:14.269 --> 02:01:17.835
Since you have the courage
to mock my feelings...

02:01:17.935 --> 02:01:19.735
Never.

02:01:19.835 --> 02:01:21.835
This is not mocking.

02:01:23.602 --> 02:01:28.169
It is just that somebody
must teach people like you their place...

02:01:28.269 --> 02:01:32.902
...because you are all
wronged and good-hearted.

02:01:35.469 --> 02:01:40.435
Unfortunately, you do not have
a single friend to tell you the truth...

02:01:40.535 --> 02:01:42.435
...in your big palace.

02:02:04.935 --> 02:02:08.335
This marriage is going to happen
sooner or later.

02:02:09.869 --> 02:02:14.369
It is certain now that
it will not be a marriage based on love.

02:02:17.269 --> 02:02:21.335
I am sure I will benefit much
from this political marriage.

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:24.835
And Ertugrul...

02:02:24.935 --> 02:02:26.902
What about Ertugrul?

02:02:27.902 --> 02:02:30.602
You will see it soon, Halime Sultan.
