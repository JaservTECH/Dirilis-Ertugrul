0:11:32.151 --> 0:11:36.517
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

0:11:36.908 --> 0:11:40.708
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

0:11:41.236 --> 0:11:44.403
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

0:12:03.584 --> 0:12:04.784
Halime!

0:12:08.334 --> 0:12:09.468
Halime?

0:12:13.477 --> 0:12:14.611
Halime!

0:12:14.817 --> 0:12:16.683
Halime! Halime!

0:12:18.721 --> 0:12:19.854
Halime!

0:12:21.946 --> 0:12:23.546
-Halime!
-Halime!

0:12:29.777 --> 0:12:31.310
Halime. Halime.

0:12:36.279 --> 0:12:37.879
Halime, my girl!

0:12:38.086 --> 0:12:41.420
Hold down the rear! Let us separate.
We will meet in Aleppo!

0:12:43.020 --> 0:12:44.486
We shall separate.

0:12:56.553 --> 0:12:57.753
Halime.

0:12:59.686 --> 0:13:01.653
-Sister?
-Come on, boy! Come on.

0:13:01.853 --> 0:13:03.786
-Sister!
-Come on!

0:13:04.986 --> 0:13:07.153
-Sister.
-Come on, we are going.

0:13:08.120 --> 0:13:09.753
Go on. Quick! Quick!

0:13:20.653 --> 0:13:22.220
Sir, they are running away.

0:13:35.686 --> 0:13:37.586
Ertugrul is trapped now...

0:13:39.086 --> 0:13:42.620
...let us catch the small Shahzade
to please Ustad.

0:13:43.720 --> 0:13:44.886
Get the horses.

0:16:09.053 --> 0:16:11.586
You carry on, Shahzade.
I will catch up with you.

0:16:12.986 --> 0:16:14.553
Come on. Come on!

0:18:46.453 --> 0:18:49.020
Bey, you catch up with them.
We will guard your back.

0:19:11.020 --> 0:19:12.520
Quick, to the horses!

0:19:50.986 --> 0:19:54.686
That bitch called Selcan shall regret
the day she was born.

0:19:55.153 --> 0:19:58.120
She will pay for the trick
she played on me dearly.

0:19:58.520 --> 0:20:00.820
I shall breath down her neck like death.

0:20:01.520 --> 0:20:03.820
There is no end to tricks in Selcan.

0:20:04.186 --> 0:20:06.653
She walks in the tribe
like a ball of fire.

0:20:06.853 --> 0:20:09.486
She bellows the fire anywhere she likes.

0:20:09.720 --> 0:20:11.853
And if my name is Kurdoglu...

0:20:12.186 --> 0:20:14.886
...I know how to turn that fire into ash.

0:20:17.020 --> 0:20:20.120
You shall take one life of
that double lived bitch.

0:20:21.053 --> 0:20:23.853
Before she can hold her baby
in her arms...

0:20:24.086 --> 0:20:27.653
...before she can brag about giving
a grandchild to the Bey bloodline...

0:20:28.086 --> 0:20:29.620
...that baby shall die.

0:20:47.086 --> 0:20:48.453
Get out of the way.

0:21:01.186 --> 0:21:02.820
My dear lamb...

0:21:08.086 --> 0:21:10.420
...I brought you water, get up.

0:21:21.220 --> 0:21:22.853
Was it you...

0:21:23.053 --> 0:21:25.086
...who killed my father Baybora?

0:21:30.186 --> 0:21:31.853
Here you are, my girl.

0:21:42.153 --> 0:21:43.653
May it be easy on you.

0:21:45.786 --> 0:21:47.620
May it be easy on you, Baci.

0:21:48.086 --> 0:21:50.920
With God’s permission, we are ready,
Gundogdu Bey.

0:21:53.820 --> 0:21:58.986
What happened, Bey? Is there something
that clouds your heart, that worries you?

0:22:01.886 --> 0:22:04.420
There are dangers everywhere, Wild Demir.

0:22:04.820 --> 0:22:08.153
I will allocate some trusted
Alps for your journey.

0:22:11.686 --> 0:22:14.186
You are son of a Bey, you are a Bey.

0:22:14.753 --> 0:22:17.153
You don’t need to tell me everything.

0:22:18.420 --> 0:22:20.953
But if there is something
I need to know...

0:22:21.220 --> 0:22:23.486
...you would tell me, right, my Bey?

0:22:24.120 --> 0:22:26.720
I always say that caution is a virtue.

0:22:28.120 --> 0:22:32.820
We cannot even trust the clouds on top
or the wind that blows.

0:22:36.153 --> 0:22:38.986
Anyway, you should start
your own preparations.

0:22:39.853 --> 0:22:43.786
Don’t talk like that, Bey.
What preparation a man like me can have?

0:22:45.120 --> 0:22:49.220
I just need to say goodbye to someone,
while there is still time.

0:22:49.886 --> 0:22:51.920
I will handle that in the mean time.

0:23:43.853 --> 0:23:44.920
Yigit!

0:24:59.186 --> 0:25:00.420
Yigit!

0:25:46.520 --> 0:25:47.720
Was it you...

0:25:47.886 --> 0:25:49.820
...who killed my father Baybora?

0:25:50.020 --> 0:25:52.420
Baybora was like a brother to me.

0:25:52.753 --> 0:25:57.586
Your father was killed by those who
see us as a threat to their Seigniory.

0:25:57.853 --> 0:25:59.486
What are you trying to say?

0:25:59.620 --> 0:26:03.020
You should understand, the killer of
your father is Suleyman Shah.

0:26:12.020 --> 0:26:16.953
Could those who we say Bey and Shah,
those who we crown, kill us, father?

0:26:20.786 --> 0:26:22.620
But if I am your son...

0:26:22.886 --> 0:26:24.886
...I shall make them pay for it.

0:26:47.086 --> 0:26:48.153
Amen.

0:26:52.953 --> 0:26:57.086
I am going, my dear wife.
We are migrating again.

0:26:58.953 --> 0:27:00.520
The caravan is ready.

0:27:01.686 --> 0:27:05.020
But this time,
you will not be in the caravan.

0:27:07.953 --> 0:27:10.153
You will not see our new homeland.

0:27:13.720 --> 0:27:18.086
When we set up our camp, the first thing
we will do will be to wed Aykiz.

0:27:21.420 --> 0:27:22.586
That day...

0:27:23.086 --> 0:27:26.453
...I shall cry quietly in a corner.

0:27:28.186 --> 0:27:32.619
As you are not beside me,
you won’t be able to wipe my tears.

0:27:36.553 --> 0:27:39.586
Aykiz will give me a grandson
when the time comes.

0:27:41.586 --> 0:27:44.953
You won’t be able to hold
those little hands and feet.

0:27:47.853 --> 0:27:52.619
My battle worn and battered heart...

0:27:54.119 --> 0:27:56.886
...will be even more worn out
being without you.

0:27:58.920 --> 0:28:05.119
But no one will need to say:
“Come on. Get up, Wild  Demir.

0:28:06.586 --> 0:28:11.753
Who will make weapons for
the Alps of this tribe other than you?”

0:28:15.620 --> 0:28:19.486
Isn’t this world a temporary moorland
for everyone, my loved one?

0:28:21.520 --> 0:28:26.486
When the time comes, I shall join
the caravan that goes to the real home.

0:28:30.520 --> 0:28:32.020
We will meet then.

0:28:33.453 --> 0:28:35.753
Knowing this is enough for me, my love.

0:28:40.486 --> 0:28:45.653
The woman I saw the first time I opened my
eyes, the woman I gave my heart and loved.

0:28:47.786 --> 0:28:51.086
Until then, while you are under
this cold ground...

0:28:53.953 --> 0:28:59.053
...I shall be feeling cold even
in front of the ironsmith’s fire.

0:29:00.453 --> 0:29:03.020
I wanted you to know that.
May God bless you.

0:29:12.020 --> 0:29:13.886
My sincere condolences, son.

0:29:16.020 --> 0:29:19.020
The world is like that.
An inn with two doors.

0:29:20.686 --> 0:29:25.220
Thank you,  Master Demir. The world is
the innkeeper, we are the travelers.

0:29:26.220 --> 0:29:30.486
Those who finish the number of breaths
given to them go under the ground.

0:29:31.553 --> 0:29:35.186
You are right, Bozok.
May God give you more patience.

0:29:36.420 --> 0:29:40.720
Anyway, see you in the camp.
Peace be upon you.

0:29:43.420 --> 0:29:47.020
Peace be upon you, Master Demir.
May you have a good journey.

0:29:53.920 --> 0:29:55.453
-Yigit!
-Don’t move!

0:29:55.853 --> 0:29:58.120
Drop down the axe. I would cut his throat!

0:31:16.453 --> 0:31:17.620
Tie him up.

0:31:31.486 --> 0:31:32.586
Halt!

0:31:33.453 --> 0:31:35.053
We need go faster, Shahzade.

0:31:35.653 --> 0:31:39.053
She loses more blood
as the horse goes faster, Ertugrul.

0:31:42.620 --> 0:31:43.820
We shall rest here.

0:32:30.886 --> 0:32:32.220
Ertugrul and the rest...

0:32:32.586 --> 0:32:34.053
...you caught them...

0:32:36.720 --> 0:32:37.786
...right?

0:32:39.086 --> 0:32:40.853
Sir, Ertugrul and others...

0:32:43.186 --> 0:32:45.486
Did you let them escape?

0:32:46.520 --> 0:32:47.820
Sir, spare us.

0:33:31.853 --> 0:33:35.686
Gokce, put these ointments
in a place we can find easily.

0:33:36.086 --> 0:33:39.086
-We cannot waste time during the journey.
-Alright, mother.

0:33:42.420 --> 0:33:46.620
Selcan, don’t lift heavy things.
God forbid, you have pains as it is.

0:33:52.686 --> 0:33:54.420
Do you know what I think?

0:33:54.886 --> 0:33:58.553
It is not wise for you stay back with
the caravan while you are pregnant.

0:33:58.753 --> 0:34:00.653
Come with us in this journey.

0:34:02.953 --> 0:34:06.053
Thank you, mother.
I do not know what Gundogdu would say.

0:34:07.920 --> 0:34:10.120
I do not think that he would oppose but...

0:34:10.786 --> 0:34:13.653
...you are right, he is your Bey,
you should ask him.

0:34:18.486 --> 0:34:19.986
You take the arms rack.

0:34:32.686 --> 0:34:33.953
Gundogdu...

0:34:36.820 --> 0:34:38.420
...Mother Hayme says...

0:34:38.686 --> 0:34:41.853
...I do not want to worry,
you should come with us as well.

0:34:42.120 --> 0:34:44.153
She is worried after last night.

0:34:44.953 --> 0:34:48.186
How come?
What happened last night for her to worry?

0:34:49.786 --> 0:34:53.820
Because of my cramps. She is afraid that
I would get tired in the caravan...

0:34:53.986 --> 0:34:56.220
...and something might happen to the baby.

0:35:04.920 --> 0:35:08.920
You are staying here as well.
After last night, I would get worried too.

0:35:09.553 --> 0:35:12.153
I want you to be in front of
my eyes all the time.

0:35:14.953 --> 0:35:18.586
So you worry for my son.
You want to be beside him.

0:35:20.520 --> 0:35:21.886
As you wish, Gundogdu.

0:00:01.000 --> 0:00:03.000


0:35:44.890 --> 0:35:48.370
We tried to stop the migration,
we did not succeed.

0:35:49.490 --> 0:35:52.730
We tried to kill Shah Suleyman,
we did not succeed.

0:35:53.690 --> 0:35:57.250
Don't mumble,
talk clearly so you can have inner peace.

0:35:58.170 --> 0:36:02.770
In the morning you sent that rabid boy
to Shah Suleyman but now we are going...

0:36:02.930 --> 0:36:04.410
...to bid him farewell.

0:36:04.730 --> 0:36:07.570
I cannot see any logic
in your actions, Bey.

0:36:10.730 --> 0:36:16.930
If my mind could only see one step beyond,
my name would be Alpargu as well, my lion.

0:36:19.130 --> 0:36:23.770
My name is Kurdoglu because I can
calculate where the arrow will land...

0:36:23.930 --> 0:36:25.850
...before it is even set on the bow.

0:36:41.370 --> 0:36:42.850
What happened, sister?

0:36:43.090 --> 0:36:45.450
It is good news, my sister, good news.

0:36:46.050 --> 0:36:48.970
It is good for you to get
on the road with Mother Hayme...

0:36:49.170 --> 0:36:52.090
...but you have to obtain
a good result from this journey.

0:36:52.410 --> 0:36:56.250
You've been looking after Suleyman since
he fell ill. If you carry on like this...

0:36:56.410 --> 0:36:59.850
...during the journey and be
the leading helper of Mother Hayme.

0:37:00.050 --> 0:37:02.530
Of course, sister,
you can be rest assured.

0:37:03.330 --> 0:37:07.410
My naive sister.
You will impress Mother Hayme so deeply...

0:37:07.570 --> 0:37:11.330
...that she will not even think about
a bride other than you. You will remind...

0:37:11.490 --> 0:37:15.530
...her that you will be marrying Ertugrul
so that she cannot go back on her word.

0:37:17.490 --> 0:37:18.810
What about Ertugrul?

0:37:19.490 --> 0:37:22.370
Does Mother Hayme not know
that his heart is with that girl?

0:37:22.490 --> 0:37:26.130
A word comes out of the mouth once, Gokce.
It does not suit someone like...

0:37:26.290 --> 0:37:29.810
...Mother Hayme to play with the pride
and kill the dreams of an innocent...

0:37:29.970 --> 0:37:34.250
...well-intentioned girl like you. If she
forgets it, you shall remind her.

0:37:35.250 --> 0:37:40.130
Sister, do you know why I am always
beside the sick bed of our Bey?

0:37:41.090 --> 0:37:45.370
You once told me that Ertugrul
would never go against his father's words.

0:37:46.330 --> 0:37:50.370
This will be over after our Bey says
that the two of us should get married.

0:37:51.130 --> 0:37:52.490
That is why.

0:37:53.330 --> 0:37:56.530
I always pray so that Shah Suleyman
can get better soon.

0:37:56.850 --> 0:37:58.810
-He should get better and...
-God forbid!

0:37:58.970 --> 0:38:02.490
Instead of worthless prayers like that
you should pray that Mother Hayme...

0:38:02.650 --> 0:38:04.690
...stand strong in front of Ertugrul.

0:38:04.850 --> 0:38:09.010
Do all that is in your power so that
she insists on you to be his bride.

0:38:14.050 --> 0:38:17.330
May you find a remedy in the lands
you go to, if God permits.

0:38:17.850 --> 0:38:21.890
May you find a remedy so that you can
greet your tribe standing strong...

0:38:22.050 --> 0:38:23.610
...in our new lands.

0:38:46.570 --> 0:38:47.930
Get really close.

0:38:55.250 --> 0:38:57.330
I ask for your blessing, mother.

0:38:59.490 --> 0:39:01.130
I bless you, my son.

0:39:04.010 --> 0:39:06.690
My father is entrusted to God first,
then to you.

0:39:07.450 --> 0:39:10.090
We don't know who is a friend
or enemy anymore.

0:39:10.570 --> 0:39:13.410
There are many jackals on the road.
Be careful.

0:39:13.850 --> 0:39:19.290
And may you succeed in protecting
your tribe, your wife and your child.

0:39:20.570 --> 0:39:24.850
When there is no peace and unity within
the tribe, migration is even harder.

0:39:26.890 --> 0:39:30.610
Your job is very difficult, son.
May God help you.

0:39:32.850 --> 0:39:37.810
Thank you, mother. Do not worry, from
the babies to goats, all life here...

0:39:38.010 --> 0:39:42.170
...is entrusted to me. We shall reach
Aleppo safe and sound, if God permits.

0:39:42.530 --> 0:39:43.890
If God permits.

0:39:46.210 --> 0:39:48.490
Come on, Alps. In the name of God.

0:40:17.850 --> 0:40:21.570
May you flow like water, mother.
May troubles be left behind as you go.

0:40:22.130 --> 0:40:26.690
May you be blessed with new weddings
and grandsons in our new lands.

0:40:27.090 --> 0:40:29.530
If God permits, my girl. If God permits.

0:40:53.010 --> 0:40:56.530
If God permits, we shall hear that
my blood brother has recovered.

0:40:58.690 --> 0:41:01.330
May God clear your road for this journey,
Mother Hayme.

0:41:01.490 --> 0:41:05.450
-To salvation, Mother Hayme.
-Alps will with be with you, Thank God.

0:41:05.810 --> 0:41:07.970
But you should still be cautious.

0:41:08.210 --> 0:41:10.890
As you know, the enemy is everywhere.

0:41:17.490 --> 0:41:20.010
You do not need to think about us,
Kurdoglu.

0:41:29.130 --> 0:41:32.450
Do not forget, Rahman.
You saw it with your own eyes last night.

0:41:33.450 --> 0:41:35.090
Snakes do not use doors.

0:41:50.370 --> 0:41:51.610
Hold tight.

0:42:02.170 --> 0:42:03.290
Halt.

0:42:06.130 --> 0:42:07.730
How is she, my Shahzade?

0:42:08.010 --> 0:42:10.570
It would be wise to check her wound,
Ertugrul.

0:42:43.690 --> 0:42:45.330
Press this over the wound.

0:42:54.330 --> 0:42:57.330
We should not stay here for long.
It might be dangerous.

0:43:01.690 --> 0:43:05.010
We should leave as soon as possible.
We shall find help in Aleppo.

0:43:05.130 --> 0:43:06.250
Alright.

0:43:07.410 --> 0:43:08.530
Ertugrul.

0:43:09.250 --> 0:43:11.530
Will you be able to bear the pain, Halime?

0:43:13.290 --> 0:43:14.610
I can, Ertugrul Bey.

0:43:31.530 --> 0:43:35.250
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS TEMPLARS CASTLE

0:43:39.850 --> 0:43:43.850
Please forgive my daughter
as she is innocent, Dear God.

0:43:45.090 --> 0:43:47.970
Your Mercifulness has no limits.

0:43:53.050 --> 0:43:54.970
You are The Most Just Revenger...

0:43:55.930 --> 0:43:57.610
...You are The Winner.

0:43:58.170 --> 0:44:01.690
You are The Most Powerful Revenger.

0:44:02.610 --> 0:44:04.730
May You curse the tyrants.

0:44:05.930 --> 0:44:09.570
I am not the tyrant here. You know that.

0:44:10.810 --> 0:44:12.370
It was you who killed Elanora.

0:44:13.450 --> 0:44:17.450
Even if you kill and
bring me back to life 40 times...

0:44:18.530 --> 0:44:21.250
...you shall not get
what you want from me.

0:44:21.690 --> 0:44:24.170
You were like this as a child as well.

0:44:24.610 --> 0:44:27.090
Stubbornness makes you unlovable.

0:44:28.290 --> 0:44:32.090
But I know how to break that stubbornness.

0:44:33.650 --> 0:44:35.650
I am getting old, Marcus.

0:44:36.490 --> 0:44:41.610
What was the name of the Bedouin
we met in Aleppo yesterday?

0:44:41.970 --> 0:44:45.570
The famous Muhiddin Ibn Arabi
from Andalucía.

0:44:46.090 --> 0:44:52.050
Instead of killing you 40 times, if I kill
him only once, would that break your will?

0:44:53.210 --> 0:44:56.010
We both know that you cannot kill him.

0:45:00.210 --> 0:45:06.530
You are right. You were stubborn and
clever like this as a child as well.

0:45:07.650 --> 0:45:13.010
In order to get my hands on that chest,
I need both of you alive.

0:45:13.930 --> 0:45:20.890
But this does not mean that I cannot throw
him in the dungeon opposite yours.

0:45:23.210 --> 0:45:28.330
Will you be able to bear seeing him
getting weak day by day?

0:45:41.810 --> 0:45:44.410
{\an8}ALEPPO

0:47:36.890 --> 0:47:38.250
Take this as well.

0:47:57.130 --> 0:47:59.730
-May it be easy on you, Aykiz.
-Thank you.

0:48:04.210 --> 0:48:05.570
How is our Bey?

0:48:05.850 --> 0:48:08.690
-He will be better, if God permits.
-If God permits.

0:48:10.330 --> 0:48:11.970
Is this your dowry?

0:48:14.610 --> 0:48:17.330
The first wedding of
the new camp will be yours.

0:48:17.610 --> 0:48:20.410
If God permits,
the second will be mine with Ertugrul.

0:48:25.690 --> 0:48:29.130
Gokce, I know that
your heart is with Ertugrul...

0:48:30.370 --> 0:48:34.090
...but you know very well
that he sees you as his little sister.

0:48:35.130 --> 0:48:38.690
You start dreaming on your own
and start to believe your own dreams...

0:48:38.810 --> 0:48:40.730
...you will be heartbroken at the end.

0:48:40.890 --> 0:48:44.450
You are wrong, Aykiz.
This is not an illusion.

0:48:47.370 --> 0:48:49.610
Shah Suleyman also told Ertugrul.

0:48:49.970 --> 0:48:53.370
He told Ertugrul that
we shall get married after the migration.

0:48:54.890 --> 0:48:57.930
Come on, get ready! Our journey begins!

0:48:59.570 --> 0:49:02.010
Do you think Ertugrul would accept this?

0:49:03.170 --> 0:49:04.970
His heart is with Halime.

0:49:05.730 --> 0:49:08.770
You need to be blind
if you don't know or see it.

0:49:12.290 --> 0:49:14.970
Please do not be so confident about this.

0:49:15.490 --> 0:49:18.130
These things rely on fate and fortune.

0:49:18.970 --> 0:49:22.610
Of course they do.
The world has so many possibilities.

0:49:23.290 --> 0:49:27.610
Look at Turgut and yourself.
You've been sweethearts since childhood...

0:49:27.770 --> 0:49:31.970
...but you are still not together.
Don't you forget about this, Aykiz.

0:49:38.170 --> 0:49:42.210
On the way to the groom's house, the bride
still says "whatever fate may hold."

0:51:10.930 --> 0:51:13.530
You will either talk here and now...

0:51:14.610 --> 0:51:16.770
...or I shall feed you to the dogs.

0:51:19.610 --> 0:51:22.850
I know that someone helped you
within the palace...

0:51:25.530 --> 0:51:27.210
...give me a name...

0:51:28.210 --> 0:51:29.690
...save your life.

0:51:40.330 --> 0:51:42.130
What is happening to this man?

0:51:42.290 --> 0:51:45.290
This is poison!
Where did he find the poison?

0:51:49.330 --> 0:51:52.090
-Did anyone enter here apart from you?
-I don't think so.

0:51:52.250 --> 0:51:54.210
No one knew he was here.

0:51:54.610 --> 0:51:57.170
Even the guards don't know
who they are guarding.

0:51:58.370 --> 0:52:00.610
I could not get a single word out of him.

0:52:01.050 --> 0:52:04.130
I have to find the spies
who infiltrated the palace.

0:52:04.890 --> 0:52:06.330
Esma...

0:52:06.970 --> 0:52:08.970
...no one should see this body.

0:52:09.130 --> 0:52:13.770
Whoever helped him die will come again
to see whether he died or not.

0:52:16.050 --> 0:52:17.370
Efendi...

0:52:17.730 --> 0:52:19.250
...with your permission...

0:52:21.410 --> 0:52:23.450
...I can take care of the body.

0:52:24.890 --> 0:52:29.730
I know how to take him out of here during
change of guard without anyone seeing.

0:52:33.970 --> 0:52:35.410
Esma...

0:52:36.010 --> 0:52:38.250
...I don't know how to repay my debt.

0:52:39.690 --> 0:52:45.130
You saved my life once and
now you are risking your life for me.

0:52:45.810 --> 0:52:49.530
It is an honor for me to work for
the vizier who sacrifices everything...

0:52:49.690 --> 0:52:53.610
...for the righteous path of God.
You can be rest assured.

0:52:54.690 --> 0:52:58.850
With God's permission, the traitor
who did this shall be punished.

0:53:34.730 --> 0:53:36.610
Petruccio, my dear friend.

0:53:37.530 --> 0:53:38.850
Cardinal.

0:53:41.130 --> 0:53:43.290
I am deeply sorry for your loss.

0:53:43.770 --> 0:53:46.850
I hope your niece's death was not in vain.

0:53:48.130 --> 0:53:51.370
Elanora sacrificed herself for our cause.

0:53:51.930 --> 0:53:54.450
Was your niece's sacrifice beneficial?

0:53:56.130 --> 0:54:00.450
I don't think so. You are not even
a step closer to the lost chest.

0:54:01.810 --> 0:54:03.730
Giovanni is still resisting...

0:54:04.450 --> 0:54:06.930
...but he shall give in soon.

0:54:07.730 --> 0:54:10.370
I know his soft spot very well.

0:54:14.770 --> 0:54:18.090
How can you be so sure
that Giovanni will start talking?

0:54:18.850 --> 0:54:21.490
I can tell our common friends in Aleppo.

0:54:21.890 --> 0:54:26.810
-With your brother?
-No. Giovanni is not my brother anymore.

0:54:27.650 --> 0:54:30.850
He chose to betray our cause.

0:54:31.530 --> 0:54:34.570
And he is paying the price of this choice.

0:54:34.970 --> 0:54:39.210
Petruccio, Petruccio,
not only the traitors...

0:54:39.890 --> 0:54:43.250
...those who cannot succeed
in their duties also pay a price.

0:54:53.850 --> 0:54:58.810
If you want me to persuade
our Holy Father for the Crusades...

0:54:59.730 --> 0:55:03.690
...you have to take back the holy relics
Muslims stole from us.

0:55:04.330 --> 0:55:08.210
I shall remind you of this everyday
until I return to Europe...

0:55:08.730 --> 0:55:10.850
...my dear friend Petruccio.

0:55:13.450 --> 0:55:16.810
-What is it, Marcus?
-Titus has returned to the castle, sir.

0:55:50.930 --> 0:55:52.210
Get your hands off me!

0:55:55.170 --> 0:55:56.330
Let go!

0:56:22.890 --> 0:56:24.210
Well done!

0:56:30.410 --> 0:56:35.010
You went with 30 knights and
returned with two Turkmen, dear Titus.

0:56:35.490 --> 0:56:37.210
Big job, big success.

0:56:41.530 --> 0:56:44.330
This child is not
an ordinary Turkmen, Cardinal.

0:56:45.050 --> 0:56:46.730
He is a Seljuk Shahzade.

0:56:47.930 --> 0:56:51.290
Isn't he one of the Shahzades
you let escape last time?

0:56:53.210 --> 0:56:54.690
Well, who is this?

0:56:55.370 --> 0:56:56.810
Your death!

0:57:18.170 --> 0:57:23.450
Well done, Titus. You are
quite brave against a wounded lion...

0:57:23.850 --> 0:57:28.410
...but when you encounter lions in the
forest, who'll look for a hole to hide?

0:57:31.890 --> 0:57:35.130
I am going to Antioch.
I have some business to attend to.

0:57:35.650 --> 0:57:40.170
I shall take back my guest when I get
back. Look after him well while I am gone.

0:57:41.210 --> 0:57:43.770
May you have a good journey, dear Thomas.

0:57:54.330 --> 0:57:56.450
Take our guest to his palace.

0:57:57.690 --> 0:57:59.690
Take him to the palace as well.

0:57:59.890 --> 0:58:04.850
This presumptuous Turkmen
shall beg for me to kill him.

0:58:16.050 --> 0:58:19.050
First we shall visit a friend.
He will look after Halime and...

0:58:19.210 --> 0:58:21.370
...we will receive his blessing.
-Alright.

0:58:22.290 --> 0:58:24.650
Be strong, my girl. We are almost there.

0:58:53.770 --> 0:58:57.730
You cowards! Why don't you untie me?
Are you afraid?

0:59:00.170 --> 0:59:02.530
Do we treat your prisoners like this?

0:59:04.210 --> 0:59:06.890
-Are you fine?
-Save your breath, young man.

0:59:07.250 --> 0:59:10.810
They won't hear you here.
They won't understand your troubles.

0:59:11.490 --> 0:59:14.730
Here, only God will hear you.

0:59:19.090 --> 0:59:20.490
Who are you?

0:59:24.610 --> 0:59:26.930
I warned you many times!

0:59:28.690 --> 0:59:33.810
I told you that your personal revenge
should not overshadow your tasks!

0:59:35.690 --> 0:59:39.570
But you went after that Turk anyway.

0:59:40.770 --> 0:59:45.370
I lost 30 knights
because of your incompetence.

0:59:47.330 --> 0:59:48.970
Forgive me, sir.

0:59:49.530 --> 0:59:53.770
Didn't you see how
the cardinal was teasing us?

0:59:55.010 --> 0:59:59.050
You humiliated me and
all the Templar Knights.

1:00:00.610 --> 1:00:02.050
Never...

1:00:02.890 --> 1:00:05.970
...ever ask me to forgive you once again.

1:00:07.850 --> 1:00:09.410
I understand, sir.

1:00:10.050 --> 1:00:11.970
-But...
-But what, Titus?

1:00:13.570 --> 1:00:18.330
Ertugrul was going to Aleppo.
I thought you might want to know this.

1:00:20.450 --> 1:00:25.090
He must be going to Aziz's palace
as an envoy of the Kayis.

1:00:33.650 --> 1:00:36.410
I shall give you once last chance, Titus.

1:00:36.810 --> 1:00:38.970
What is it you want me to do, sir?

1:00:39.130 --> 1:00:40.930
Go to Aleppo immediately.

1:00:41.490 --> 1:00:45.290
Talk with Nasir and finish this job.

1:00:46.290 --> 1:00:48.410
Then clean your own mess.

1:00:50.210 --> 1:00:51.770
I understand, sir.

1:00:52.330 --> 1:00:56.570
First complete your tasks
for the Son of God, Titus.

1:00:57.930 --> 1:00:59.730
Then, Ertugrul is yours.

1:01:00.330 --> 1:01:02.330
You can do whatever you wish.

1:02:01.930 --> 1:02:04.490
-Thank God you are here.
-Thank God we meet again.

1:02:04.650 --> 1:02:06.050
Where were you, Bey?

1:02:06.330 --> 1:02:08.730
We were worried when you did not show up.

1:02:11.330 --> 1:02:12.690
Where is Turgut Alp?

1:02:17.090 --> 1:02:21.130
-Father, where is Yigit? He is not here.
-Keep calm, keep calm, my girl.

1:02:22.130 --> 1:02:24.610
I will call the doctor and
meet you in the lodge.

1:03:06.170 --> 1:03:11.410
May the Son of God greet our dead brother
in His kingdom up in heaven.

1:03:13.370 --> 1:03:15.570
Will his death make our job easier?

1:03:16.210 --> 1:03:19.530
Aziz is really confused
about Sahabettin at the moment.

1:03:20.010 --> 1:03:25.170
When the assassin is found dead
after accusing Sahabettin...

1:03:25.890 --> 1:03:28.090
...this will confuse him even more.

1:03:32.210 --> 1:03:33.810
The rest is up to you.

1:03:35.490 --> 1:03:38.890
You must feed fears
and suspicions within Aziz.

1:03:41.650 --> 1:03:44.010
I will be a guest of
the emir tonight as well.

1:03:44.210 --> 1:03:48.370
In the sweetest moment of our night
I shall whisper Ustad's words in his ear.

1:03:48.730 --> 1:03:50.810
He will be my slave from now on.

1:03:52.730 --> 1:03:54.090
Eftalya.

1:03:54.650 --> 1:03:57.090
Don't get carried away
while doing your job.

1:04:02.330 --> 1:04:07.170
I am Esma to El Aziz and
Eftalya to you and your Templar Knights.

1:04:08.010 --> 1:04:09.490
I'm only doing my job.

1:04:18.930 --> 1:04:21.530
Shall I take the tray
if you won't eat, Efendi?

1:04:49.490 --> 1:04:50.650
Father?

1:04:54.450 --> 1:04:56.530
Yigit still has not arrived, father.

1:04:58.570 --> 1:05:00.450
Father, Yigit has not arrived.

1:05:11.530 --> 1:05:13.450
May God help and be with us.

1:05:14.290 --> 1:05:16.690
Dear God,
please don't leave us in despair.

1:05:19.730 --> 1:05:24.170
Amen. She shall recover.
May God bestow a speedy recovery upon her.

1:05:25.730 --> 1:05:28.050
Hanim, how is our guest?

1:05:28.970 --> 1:05:32.690
The doctor said that she should regain
consciousness by the morning, God willing.

1:05:33.850 --> 1:05:36.690
We should go to the hall.
Our sheikh would like to see you.

1:05:36.810 --> 1:05:38.130
Is Ibn Arabi here?

1:05:40.970 --> 1:05:43.610
You can go, Ertugrul. I will wait here.

1:07:21.330 --> 1:07:24.410
What is this outrage?
How can you come in without permission?

1:07:26.010 --> 1:07:30.770
Kurdoglu, people are entering the marquee
not by the door but from the back...

1:07:31.090 --> 1:07:34.490
...and you still request permission.

1:07:35.330 --> 1:07:38.690
Get to the point, Gundogdu.
Say what you have to say.

1:07:39.610 --> 1:07:43.210
I will not say anything to you until
my father opens his eyes, Kurdoglu.

1:07:43.370 --> 1:07:46.970
But when he opens his eyes,
not even the candles...

1:07:47.170 --> 1:07:51.530
...even if all the stars in heaven go out,
no one can take you away from me.

1:07:53.490 --> 1:07:55.490
In the mean time...

1:07:58.010 --> 1:08:00.010
...a bow and arrow are good.

1:08:00.210 --> 1:08:04.090
You don't need to get face to face
like you do with a sword or a dagger.

1:08:35.704 --> 1:08:37.704


1:09:41.930 --> 1:09:43.490
Welcome, son.

1:09:44.370 --> 1:09:46.450
You are always welcome here.

1:09:50.450 --> 1:09:52.370
I am joyous I saw you.

1:10:00.930 --> 1:10:06.130
May she recover soon. Our master's
grandson told us what happened.

1:10:09.450 --> 1:10:14.170
Efendi, when I first came to Aleppo,
the Templar Knights wanted to kill me...

1:10:14.770 --> 1:10:19.250
...but we were saved with your help.
I saw you in my dream.

1:10:19.890 --> 1:10:24.770
Help is from God, don't ever forget
that He is the source of all favors...

1:10:25.130 --> 1:10:28.410
...and don't ever tell
your brothers your dreams.

1:10:32.010 --> 1:10:34.570
His highness Joseph also had a dream.

1:10:35.570 --> 1:10:38.210
He told it to his father
for him to interpret it.

1:10:39.090 --> 1:10:42.050
What was Prophet Jacob's
first reply to him?

1:10:43.770 --> 1:10:46.210
Do not tell your brothers your dreams.

1:10:47.770 --> 1:10:49.090
Do not forget...

1:10:50.090 --> 1:10:55.370
...if you don't keep one secret, the Owner
of Secrets will not give you another one.

1:10:57.970 --> 1:10:59.210
I understand.

1:11:04.290 --> 1:11:06.130
Look, our guest is here.

1:11:07.850 --> 1:11:11.170
He has secrets,
he respects the Owner of Secrets.

1:11:24.650 --> 1:11:27.290
May God keep his blessing over us.

1:11:27.730 --> 1:11:32.650
It was Sultan Geylani's statement:
"Birds fly with their own kind.

1:11:33.610 --> 1:11:37.050
Eagles with eagles, crows with crows."

1:11:37.610 --> 1:11:41.130
Our job was to bring the eagles together.

1:11:45.650 --> 1:11:47.050
Thank God.

1:11:56.170 --> 1:11:59.930
You are entrusted first in God,
then with each other.

1:12:01.690 --> 1:12:04.090
You can discuss everything together.

1:12:20.450 --> 1:12:22.450
What do the Templars want from you?

1:12:34.890 --> 1:12:36.130
Brother Dogan?

1:12:37.770 --> 1:12:39.090
Yes, my brother?

1:12:42.650 --> 1:12:46.090
Do you think Alp Turgut and
Yigit will be here in the morning?

1:12:49.410 --> 1:12:51.370
I do not know, Brother Bamsi.

1:12:55.010 --> 1:12:58.570
We fended off so many troubles
while we were together.

1:13:00.930 --> 1:13:02.890
The Mongols and Crusaders...

1:13:03.570 --> 1:13:05.170
...wolves and bears...

1:13:06.050 --> 1:13:08.330
...snow and winter did not stop us.

1:13:09.010 --> 1:13:11.570
So those knights would have...

1:13:16.850 --> 1:13:18.690
I do not know, Brother Bamsi.

1:13:20.050 --> 1:13:22.450
My tongue cannot say
what is in my heart...

1:13:23.170 --> 1:13:25.850
...my heart cannot accept
what my tongue might say.

1:13:27.410 --> 1:13:31.930
Where is this Bey Afsin? He said he would
be back by nightfall but he is not.

1:13:33.730 --> 1:13:35.890
I do not know that either, Brother Bamsi.

1:13:36.050 --> 1:13:40.090
We do not know anything about him.
May God bless us with a good ending.

1:13:44.010 --> 1:13:47.090
Is it true that there is
a black death plague in the Kayi tribe?

1:13:47.770 --> 1:13:49.010
Plague?

1:13:50.570 --> 1:13:52.930
I was surprised when I heard it as well.

1:13:53.170 --> 1:13:56.450
But our commander Nasir said that
he got such an intelligence.

1:13:57.090 --> 1:13:59.530
There was no plague when I left the tribe.

1:14:00.090 --> 1:14:03.490
But we caught someone who was trying
to contaminate the tribe's food...

1:14:03.650 --> 1:14:05.130
...with plagued meat.

1:14:05.770 --> 1:14:08.210
She said that the Templars had ordered it.

1:14:08.890 --> 1:14:11.170
Are they under every stone we turn?

1:14:13.610 --> 1:14:16.930
If the news of a plague
in our tribe reached Aleppo before me...

1:14:17.370 --> 1:14:19.970
...it means that
the Templars are behind it.

1:14:23.050 --> 1:14:25.530
How much do you trust
this commander called Nasir?

1:14:27.050 --> 1:14:30.410
I do not trust anyone
in the palace anymore, Ertugrul.

1:14:35.250 --> 1:14:38.530
When I was just about to catch
the man who tried to kill me...

1:14:49.650 --> 1:14:50.730
Stop, don't!

1:14:54.370 --> 1:14:56.530
Nasir killed him for no reason at all.

1:14:58.210 --> 1:14:59.970
That man did not die.

1:15:00.810 --> 1:15:03.130
I questioned him when he recovered.

1:15:03.890 --> 1:15:06.890
But yesterday,
he killed himself right before my eyes.

1:15:09.890 --> 1:15:11.530
What do you plan to do?

1:15:12.450 --> 1:15:16.250
First thing tomorrow
I will tell El Aziz about Nasir.

1:15:18.770 --> 1:15:21.970
My nephew will not turn
a deaf ear to my warnings this time.

1:09:03.262 --> 1:09:05.702
Do not touch her.
Do not touch and move away.

1:09:08.018 --> 1:09:11.378
Midwife, what is happening?
For the love of God please help her.

0:00:03.025 --> 0:00:05.025


1:15:31.900 --> 1:15:33.566
Be patient, my soul

1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:36.700
Don’t expect a remedy to your problem

1:15:37.833 --> 1:15:42.566
Don’t throw yourself into a fire
and expect your lover to save you

1:15:44.533 --> 1:15:49.033
Pearls of tears weep through
the mother of pearl of your eyes

1:15:49.566 --> 1:15:53.800
Don’t expect anything from
the female with coral pearl lips

1:15:55.133 --> 1:15:58.033
Come, do not rejoice

1:15:59.200 --> 1:16:01.300
and cry, poor nightingale

1:16:02.633 --> 1:16:07.833
Don’t expect anything from
the female with a mouth like rose garden

1:16:11.266 --> 1:16:13.833
My Esma? My beautiful eyes?

1:16:15.266 --> 1:16:16.866
My silky face?

1:16:17.766 --> 1:16:19.533
Why are you so down?

1:16:20.166 --> 1:16:22.000
What is it that bothers you?

1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:25.200
Didn’t you like the poem?

1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:31.300
Is it possible for me to not like a poem
from that enchanting voice of yours?

1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:39.933
Is it possible for me to fall
into the darkness...

1:16:40.133 --> 1:16:42.300
...while you shine my night by being here?

1:16:42.700 --> 1:16:46.233
Don’t you know how anxious I wait for
the time we can be together and rejoice.

1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:47.600
Well?

1:16:47.766 --> 1:16:49.900
What is your trouble then? Tell me.

1:16:54.933 --> 1:16:58.900
I seal my lips as I am afraid
that I might be presumptuous.

1:17:04.733 --> 1:17:05.933
My Esma.

1:17:06.900 --> 1:17:08.100
Tell me.

1:17:12.900 --> 1:17:16.733
-Sahabettin.
-I don’t understand. Sahabettin?

1:17:17.900 --> 1:17:19.666
Did he do something to you?

1:17:19.966 --> 1:17:22.500
-Did he...
-No, not like that.

1:17:22.933 --> 1:17:26.066
I am only a loyal and
trusted servant in his eyes.

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:29.733
But this is my fear.

1:17:31.533 --> 1:17:34.833
I fear that I might have sinned
because of him, my sultan.

1:17:40.066 --> 1:17:42.500
He trusts me more than anyone else.

1:17:43.300 --> 1:17:46.600
All the secrets he hides from others,
he shares with me.

1:17:50.866 --> 1:17:53.800
He didn’t even hide
the assassin from me, my sultan.

1:17:57.033 --> 1:17:59.166
I was taking food to him every day.

1:18:00.900 --> 1:18:02.233
But today...

1:18:04.933 --> 1:18:06.533
...the man...

1:18:06.866 --> 1:18:09.833
...died with foams
coming out of his mouth.

1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:15.000
I think he was poisoned, my sultan.

1:18:15.833 --> 1:18:17.733
Why didn’t you tell me, Esma?

1:18:20.666 --> 1:18:21.966
I was afraid.

1:18:22.666 --> 1:18:25.733
-And I am still afraid.
-What are you afraid of?

1:18:27.700 --> 1:18:29.166
If Sahabettin...

1:18:30.066 --> 1:18:33.833
...poisoned that man with
the food I took there...

1:18:35.533 --> 1:18:37.766
What if I gave that poison...

1:18:39.066 --> 1:18:41.733
...and committed a sin by killing him?

1:18:44.966 --> 1:18:48.000
It is alright, do not worry.

1:18:52.166 --> 1:18:53.733
My sultan...

1:18:54.666 --> 1:18:57.000
...I knew that he was not an
innocent man...

1:18:57.633 --> 1:18:59.966
...but why didn’t he punish him himself?

1:19:00.166 --> 1:19:02.200
Why did he hide it from me?

1:19:03.633 --> 1:19:06.100
I have not even harmed
an ant until this day.

1:19:07.533 --> 1:19:09.700
-You know my heart.
-Okay.

1:19:10.100 --> 1:19:12.966
-I can’t even step on an ant.
-It is alright.

1:19:15.933 --> 1:19:17.600
May God forgive me.

1:19:19.766 --> 1:19:21.500
What if I sinned and...

1:19:22.066 --> 1:19:23.700
...killed him?

1:19:24.133 --> 1:19:27.233
It is alright. Do not worry.

1:19:31.266 --> 1:19:32.700
It is over.

1:19:33.666 --> 1:19:34.900
Do not worry.

1:19:35.066 --> 1:19:36.233
It is over.

1:19:36.633 --> 1:19:37.800
Do not worry.

1:19:39.033 --> 1:19:40.200
It is over.

1:19:53.066 --> 1:19:55.633
My daughter...

1:19:57.066 --> 1:19:59.566
...looks like the moon.

1:20:03.066 --> 1:20:05.500
Her eyebrows are like...

1:20:06.566 --> 1:20:08.666
...a stretched bow.

1:20:12.300 --> 1:20:17.733
When she waves her hair...

1:20:20.033 --> 1:20:25.633
...she looks like a pony with long mare.

1:20:28.700 --> 1:20:33.733
There will be a feast soon...

1:20:36.533 --> 1:20:42.733
...her face will shine up the room.

1:20:45.066 --> 1:20:49.900
She is just like a son...

1:20:51.700 --> 1:20:57.500
...who will be a valiant Bey.

1:21:11.500 --> 1:21:12.566
Hayme?

1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:16.300
Hayme?

1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:18.733
Mother Hayme? Mother Hayme, wake up.

1:21:20.866 --> 1:21:24.066
-What happened, my girl?
-Do now panic, mother, it is good news.

1:21:24.766 --> 1:21:26.733
Suleyman Shah called your name.

1:21:27.700 --> 1:21:29.666
Bey? Bey?

1:21:30.733 --> 1:21:32.166
Bey, I am here.

1:21:35.266 --> 1:21:37.933
-Did he say anything else?
-No, mother.

1:21:38.133 --> 1:21:39.866
He only said your name.

1:21:55.666 --> 1:21:58.666
My girl, may God bless you.

1:21:59.900 --> 1:22:02.100
You suffer with us.

1:22:03.500 --> 1:22:05.666
You did not stay with your sister...

1:22:05.833 --> 1:22:07.800
...you set on the road with us.

1:22:07.966 --> 1:22:12.666
Please do not say that, Mother Hayme.
I see Suleyman Shah as my father as well.

1:22:13.266 --> 1:22:15.966
He has every right over me and my sister.

1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:19.233
Moreover...

1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:21.600
...I will be his bride soon.

1:22:22.100 --> 1:22:23.866
I will call him father.

1:22:25.533 --> 1:22:28.066
I pray to God every time I see you two.

1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:32.533
I pray to God for a life like
yours for Ertugrul and I.

1:22:35.233 --> 1:22:39.833
When I learned that you found me suitable
for Ertugrul and wanted me as a bride...

1:22:41.166 --> 1:22:43.066
...I was honored.
-Gokce.

1:22:46.166 --> 1:22:47.666
It is late now.

1:22:47.966 --> 1:22:49.533
You are very tired.

1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:52.200
Go and sleep, my girl.

1:22:55.700 --> 1:22:57.300
I am sorry, Mother Hayme.

1:22:57.833 --> 1:22:59.166
I was tactless.

1:23:01.900 --> 1:23:04.000
-I only...
-Gokce.

1:23:05.300 --> 1:23:09.066
Look, my girl. This is a matter of fate.

1:23:10.033 --> 1:23:12.566
It cannot be realized by my wishes.

1:23:13.900 --> 1:23:17.066
Fate is what God has written for us.

1:23:17.966 --> 1:23:19.533
Do you understand?

1:23:22.133 --> 1:23:25.533
Go on, go and rest for a bit. Come on.

1:24:19.633 --> 1:24:23.633
Do not fear, my Shahzade.
You will not be subjected to this.

1:24:24.300 --> 1:24:26.866
You come from a noble blood.

1:24:30.066 --> 1:24:31.633
Let my Turgut Aga go.

1:24:34.100 --> 1:24:38.866
Noble people cannot be sad
over the fates of their slaves.

1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:43.733
They can only be anxious for their cause.

1:24:49.566 --> 1:24:52.600
You cowards!
Kill me without playing around!

1:24:52.866 --> 1:24:57.500
Your end will not be so easy, Turkmen.
You will beg...

1:24:58.566 --> 1:25:00.033
...but you will live.

1:25:00.533 --> 1:25:02.633
In a way I want you to.

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:07.066
I have only one live and
it is borrowed from God.

1:25:08.733 --> 1:25:10.633
How can you scare me?

1:25:11.100 --> 1:25:14.533
Sometimes people even get scared
from themselves.

1:25:16.966 --> 1:25:23.166
If they don’t fear for themselves, they
fear for the lives of their loved ones.

1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:26.166
Isn’t that so, Giovanni?

1:25:45.866 --> 1:25:49.566
Valiant boy.
Do not trust your youth and courage.

1:25:50.733 --> 1:25:52.300
This is not a struggle.

1:25:53.066 --> 1:25:58.133
There is no one here
other than God who can hear you.

1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:03.200
Dear God...

1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:06.100
...be my side and help me.

1:26:10.833 --> 1:26:16.766
As you get desperate,
remember that God is The Ultimate Decider.

1:26:18.166 --> 1:26:25.033
While you starve, recite that
He is The Giver of Prosperity.

1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:31.733
You are with your God here.
Do not forget this.

1:26:32.833 --> 1:26:37.100
And know that you are
in the School of Joseph.

1:26:38.833 --> 1:26:41.933
If you turn your back on God
and turn to yourself...

1:26:42.266 --> 1:26:46.233
...they will make you so that
you fear from your own self.

1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:34.300
I will succeed with this miserable Turk
where I failed with Giovanni.

1:27:35.733 --> 1:27:38.933
How long do you think it will take
for him to give in, sir?

1:27:39.100 --> 1:27:44.100
According to the methods in this book,
he can only resist for 40 days.

1:27:44.566 --> 1:27:45.833
And then?

1:27:47.133 --> 1:27:49.933
I was not aware of your arrival,
dear Thomas.

1:27:53.266 --> 1:27:55.300
You are like the angel of death.

1:27:57.566 --> 1:27:59.833
You showed up suddenly once again.

1:28:00.533 --> 1:28:02.033
How are our guests?

1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:05.600
They are resting in their quarters.

1:28:06.566 --> 1:28:10.033
Are you going to be victorious
through the mice you put in dungeons?

1:28:11.133 --> 1:28:13.866
Even I have a hard time
in understanding you.

1:28:24.233 --> 1:28:25.866
Dear Thomas...

1:28:27.033 --> 1:28:30.266
...I do not stick my nose
at your business in Europe.

1:28:31.033 --> 1:28:33.700
And you should not dwell
in the matters here.

1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:39.066
That is your decision. I am merely
trying to convince our Holy Father...

1:28:39.233 --> 1:28:40.966
...to a new Crusade.

1:28:41.866 --> 1:28:48.666
I will find Ibn Arabi’s chest and
the sacred relics inside sooner or later.

1:28:49.566 --> 1:28:53.633
This is a promise and
the Son of God may be my witness.

1:28:55.500 --> 1:28:58.866
But I will not do it
with knights like Titus.

1:28:59.200 --> 1:29:03.200
I will do it through people who think
they are still Turks but...

1:29:03.533 --> 1:29:09.266
...I shall decide on what they shall be.
-How will you accomplish this?

1:29:12.233 --> 1:29:15.100
With an old Asian legend.

1:29:29.266 --> 1:29:32.166
We are about to pick
the fruit of our hard work.

1:29:32.866 --> 1:29:37.500
The Vizier is as good as dead
for El Aziz now. Aleppo will remember...

1:29:37.666 --> 1:29:41.133
...Sahabettin as a traitor
who collaborated with the Crusaders.

1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:48.533
And I will reveal this betrayal and become
his highness Ameer’ s only trusted aide.

1:29:49.900 --> 1:29:51.600
What about Ertugrul?

1:29:52.200 --> 1:29:54.066
I mean Kayis...

1:29:55.300 --> 1:29:57.033
...and their territory?

1:29:57.300 --> 1:29:59.633
It will be resolved today, right?

1:29:59.833 --> 1:30:05.733
Don’t you worry about it. El Aziz is
a puppet, which I hold the strings now.

1:30:06.166 --> 1:30:10.633
Ertugrul will leave that palace
as a man who lost everything.

1:30:12.033 --> 1:30:14.800
No, my friend. You are mistaken.

1:30:16.033 --> 1:30:21.133
Ertugrul will understand
what he lost when he meets us.

1:30:39.133 --> 1:30:40.233
Ertugrul?

1:30:42.600 --> 1:30:43.833
Great God!

1:30:48.233 --> 1:30:49.733
Ertugrul, be careful.

1:30:53.966 --> 1:30:55.600
Ertugrul, be careful.

1:31:09.166 --> 1:31:11.533
I thank God. You are better now.

1:31:13.066 --> 1:31:14.300
Father?

1:31:15.833 --> 1:31:17.533
Father, where is Yigit?

1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:21.666
Did something happen to Yigit,
where is my brother?

1:31:21.800 --> 1:31:25.800
No, my dear girl. Nothing happened to him.
He is with the Alps.

1:31:27.066 --> 1:31:29.800
Calm down, your wound might
start to bleed.

1:31:31.233 --> 1:31:32.800
Where are we, father?

1:31:34.233 --> 1:31:37.666
We reached Aleppo, my girl.
We are at a secure place.

1:31:41.300 --> 1:31:43.300
Father, why is Yigit not with us?

1:31:44.200 --> 1:31:46.033
I want to see my brother.

1:31:46.300 --> 1:31:48.566
You will see him tomorrow, my girl.

1:31:50.766 --> 1:31:52.733
Sleep now. You should sleep.

1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:55.066
Sleep and rest.

1:32:01.166 --> 1:32:02.600
Dear God...

1:32:02.733 --> 1:32:07.000
...spare these innocents.
Bring Yigit to us safe and sound.

1:32:32.266 --> 1:32:36.900
The servant told the truth.
The man is indeed poisoned, your highness.

1:32:36.925 --> 1:32:38.925


1:32:38.950 --> 1:32:40.950


1:32:40.975 --> 1:32:42.975


1:33:21.933 --> 1:33:25.933
Akcakoca, what kind of a disaster
this plague is?

1:33:27.633 --> 1:33:30.566
Didn’t we kill all those sheep
to fend it off?

1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:34.166
We did, Bey. We did but...

1:33:35.533 --> 1:33:39.300
...this is a child’s doing. She couldn’t
sacrifice her lamb and hid it.

1:33:43.500 --> 1:33:46.800
We set on the road tomorrow.
What will happen to these people?

1:33:48.900 --> 1:33:51.900
Bey, there is nothing we can do for them.

1:33:52.300 --> 1:33:54.733
In a few days they will...

1:33:58.166 --> 1:33:59.866
Will we leave them here?

1:34:00.866 --> 1:34:02.600
I will stay with them.

1:34:04.866 --> 1:34:07.233
Bey, I know there is nothing I can do...

1:34:07.566 --> 1:34:09.933
...but I can relieve their pain
for a while.

1:34:15.100 --> 1:34:16.700
Akcakoca...

1:34:16.900 --> 1:34:21.133
...there are some who don’t want to
migrate. I need to talk to them.

1:34:21.833 --> 1:34:24.200
If they stay here, it would be a disaster.

1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:27.133
Whatever happens, they need to know this.

1:34:29.300 --> 1:34:31.200
May God make it easy for you.

1:34:31.225 --> 1:34:33.225


1:34:33.250 --> 1:34:35.250


1:35:09.133 --> 1:35:10.766
Your highness Ameer.

1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:22.533
I brought the gratitude of Kayi tribe
and my father Suleyman Shah’s regards...

1:35:22.700 --> 1:35:24.700
...for the new home you have given us.

1:35:42.600 --> 1:35:44.200
About your tribe...

1:35:46.166 --> 1:35:48.266
...some rumors have
reached my ears.

1:35:50.300 --> 1:35:52.933
Are you going to say anything
about them, Ertugrul?

1:35:54.866 --> 1:35:57.733
I talked with your vizier
Sahabettin Tugrul as well...

1:35:58.066 --> 1:35:59.766
...these rumors are lies.

1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:04.900
Templars who are not fond of the alliance
between us attacked our tribe.

1:36:05.866 --> 1:36:09.533
Those who tried to spread disease
in our tribe and the people...

1:36:09.666 --> 1:36:11.866
...who spread these rumors are the same.

1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:16.566
You are lying, Ertugrul.

1:36:43.233 --> 1:36:48.533
The enemy who you think is beyond your
borders are actually inside your palace.

1:36:49.633 --> 1:36:50.966
You are not aware.

1:37:22.533 --> 1:37:23.900
Your highness...

1:37:32.933 --> 1:37:34.966
What are you doing here, Nasir?

1:37:35.766 --> 1:37:37.700
Where is his highness the Ameer?

1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:48.766
Guards.

1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:51.733
How dare you?

1:37:53.666 --> 1:37:55.500
Inform El Aziz immediately.

1:37:56.566 --> 1:37:57.966
Calm down, Vizier.

1:37:58.200 --> 1:38:01.300
This is actually the order of
his highness the Ameer.

1:38:03.066 --> 1:38:05.500
He personally wants to question you.

1:38:18.866 --> 1:38:20.200
Is Kurdoglu not here?

1:38:21.666 --> 1:38:23.600
I do not know where he is, Bey.

1:38:24.300 --> 1:38:28.100
He told me to pack his belongings
and make them ready for the caravan.

1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:31.966
He is to solve an important matter
and join the caravan later.

1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:36.733
He will join the caravan you say.
So Kurdoglu Bey will migrate with us.

1:38:37.766 --> 1:38:42.533
Alpargu, tell me. Your Bey does not
do anything without informing you.

1:38:43.166 --> 1:38:45.000
I really do not know, Bey.

1:38:45.233 --> 1:38:48.733
He only said that it was
about Suleyman Shah...

1:38:49.666 --> 1:38:51.000
...that was all.

1:39:21.700 --> 1:39:24.266
The cart shook him up more than
we expected, Mother Hayme.

1:39:24.566 --> 1:39:27.966
You are right, Master Demir.
It is good that we stopped to rest.

1:39:28.233 --> 1:39:30.733
The horses will have a chance to
rest as well.

1:39:33.633 --> 1:39:37.100
May God give him health,
so that he can walk while entering Aleppo.

1:39:38.033 --> 1:39:39.233
If God permits.

1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:07.900
-Hayme.
-Bey!

1:40:08.933 --> 1:40:10.200
Bey!

1:40:24.033 --> 1:40:25.266
Bey?

1:40:52.200 --> 1:40:55.666
Come on, my girl. Stand back so that
our Bey can breathe freely.

1:41:30.855 --> 1:41:32.855


1:41:32.881 --> 1:41:35.681
Tell me, why is the Ameer not coming?

1:41:38.541 --> 1:41:42.441
I really do not know why his highness
is acting like this, my Vizier.

1:41:43.175 --> 1:41:47.475
I have insisted repeatedly
but he did not want to talk.

1:41:49.030 --> 1:41:51.764
But he gave you an assurance.

1:41:51.851 --> 1:41:54.751
You shall be tried justly.

1:41:56.036 --> 1:42:01.103
And I shall be personally responsible
for your just trial.

1:42:05.251 --> 1:42:06.918
You may leave, Nasir.

1:42:28.181 --> 1:42:29.847
Dear God...

1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:35.460
...I am ready to be hurt,
but don’t let the justice be hurt.

1:42:37.819 --> 1:42:40.086
Do not give the tyrants an opportunity.

1:42:42.154 --> 1:42:44.921
The tyrant may kill me if he wishes...

1:42:46.093 --> 1:42:51.226
...but the order that shall dignify
Your name may live until eternity, my God.

1:44:00.474 --> 1:44:02.474


1:43:28.558 --> 1:43:29.858
Turkmen brave.

1:43:30.843 --> 1:43:32.076
Ertugrul Bey.

1:43:36.717 --> 1:43:38.817
You won’t regret it if you turn around.

1:44:02.793 --> 1:44:07.060
Efendi Titus says: “The eagle is in
the cage, now it is the wolf’s turn.”
