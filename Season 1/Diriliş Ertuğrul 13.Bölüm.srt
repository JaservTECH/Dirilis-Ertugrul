Episode 13 will start after 12:20 min

12:16.847 --> 12:19.847
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:22.086 --> 12:25.086
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:26.121 --> 12:29.121
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.034
Ertugrul, this woman...

12:51.567 --> 12:52.567
Eftelya.

13:04.301 --> 13:05.467
What are we going to do?

13:07.567 --> 13:10.201
We are so much defeated that
we can not even surrender.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.967
Their oppression shall increase
so that our victory be more glorious.

13:17.034 --> 13:18.667
There is no giving up, brother!

13:18.901 --> 13:19.967
No way!

13:31.401 --> 13:32.901
Where is our Bey going to?

13:33.534 --> 13:36.001
We need to be
fast Arabian horses to catch him.

13:41.934 --> 13:43.001
Come on!

13:50.501 --> 13:57.501
{\an8}AL-AQSA MOSQUE, JERUSALEM.

16:38.201 --> 16:39.267
Ertugrul Bey!

16:39.334 --> 16:40.334
Nanny!

16:40.401 --> 16:41.567
Where is Esma?

16:45.267 --> 16:46.534
Esma burned herself alive.

16:50.067 --> 16:51.701
So what will we do, son?

16:55.234 --> 16:58.634
I must have El Aziz
sit and tell him everything.

16:59.634 --> 17:01.101
If necessary...

17:01.201 --> 17:05.534
...I will beat him up like a spoiled brat,
till he comes to his senses.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.367
How are we going to do that?

17:11.634 --> 17:13.501
You must get him out of the palace.

17:17.467 --> 17:18.534
Look.

17:19.301 --> 17:23.401
El Aziz wants to marry Halime before
waiting for the wedding ceremony.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.701
Their marriage will be solemnized soon.

17:25.934 --> 17:27.534
This is El Aziz's family tradition.

17:28.367 --> 17:33.434
The men take their wives to the
hunting lodge right after the wedding.

17:34.101 --> 17:36.701
That will be the only time that
he goes out of the palace.

17:36.934 --> 17:39.501
That will be the only time
that I can bring you together.

17:39.567 --> 17:40.901
Wait till I report you.

17:40.967 --> 17:42.201
Ertugrul!

17:44.067 --> 17:45.901
Yo go nanny, hurry up!

17:48.101 --> 17:49.201
Who are you?

17:50.401 --> 17:52.901
The brother of Bisol whom you murdered!

17:57.534 --> 17:58.634
Titus.

18:01.467 --> 18:02.601
Ebu Hisham!

18:04.034 --> 18:05.434
Ebu Hisham in Jerusalem...

18:06.301 --> 18:08.234
...a commander in the Aleppo Palace...

18:09.467 --> 18:11.034
a Bey in the Kayi nomad tent.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.167
So what, are you baffled?

18:17.334 --> 18:19.701
You are just a pitiful demon, Titus.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.267
Created by the smokeless fire...

18:24.234 --> 18:29.034
...who ambushes on the right way,
putting fear in the weak hearts...

18:29.934 --> 18:32.301
...and infiltrating the strong
and deceiving them.

18:33.601 --> 18:36.134
And you buzz off as soon
as you hear the God's name.

18:38.501 --> 18:40.701
The Alps that I killed
in your nomad tent...

18:41.401 --> 18:43.701
...the Beys who I blinded by my money...

18:45.334 --> 18:49.701
...and Turgut, who is begging
to be killed in my castle...

18:51.367 --> 18:53.234
They all said the same thing.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.067
They are where they deserve to be.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.501
And I am before you, Ertugrul.

19:01.134 --> 19:02.701
You will also get what you deserve.

21:12.534 --> 21:13.567
Bey!

21:28.467 --> 21:30.234
What happened to Turgut, Afsin Bey?

21:31.201 --> 21:32.201
I entered...

21:33.134 --> 21:35.001
...into the Templars' castle for Turgut

21:36.067 --> 21:37.501
Is Turgut alive, Afsin Bey?

21:39.234 --> 21:43.967
We can not help but pray for him
to die as soon as possible.

21:48.034 --> 21:50.901
But there are things you should know.

21:52.067 --> 21:53.067
But...

21:53.634 --> 21:56.434
But what? Speak Afsin, but what?

22:30.434 --> 22:33.401
There were two sisters
from one of the Oghuz Tribes.

22:38.067 --> 22:39.334
Like you and me?

22:40.501 --> 22:41.667
Like the two of us.

22:42.701 --> 22:48.367
Those sisters were so smart,
so beautiful that their father said:

22:49.934 --> 22:52.634
“Only God can solemnize these girls.”

22:58.667 --> 23:00.567
Did our father use to think like that?

23:05.134 --> 23:07.067
It was your father saying that, Gokce.

23:10.001 --> 23:11.701
One day, the Bey...

23:12.467 --> 23:16.267
...took his daughters to a place
where no man has gone before...

23:16.901 --> 23:19.434
...and put them on the
peak of a high mountain.

23:20.234 --> 23:23.167
While the sisters were
waiting on this mountain...

23:23.234 --> 23:26.301
...a grey wolf came
into sight around the mountain.

23:27.401 --> 23:29.601
The wolf got married to the elder sister.

23:30.401 --> 23:31.534
Brother Gundogdu!

23:33.134 --> 23:36.434
And the younger sister got married
to the younger brother of the wolf.

23:37.601 --> 23:39.434
Both sisters got pregnant one day.

23:40.434 --> 23:43.567
Their sons voices sounded
like the grey wolves.

23:44.634 --> 23:49.101
Both sisters' sons reproduced
with the soul of the grey wolf.

23:50.301 --> 23:54.101
Their tribe descended from these sisters.

23:57.001 --> 24:01.167
Just as the Kayis will grow
and descend from us one day.

24:19.934 --> 24:21.034
Ertugrul Bey!

24:22.234 --> 24:24.201
Don't do it, just listen.

24:33.534 --> 24:37.001
You should know that I am meeting
with this bastard just because of you.

24:46.967 --> 24:48.001
Oh my.

24:48.167 --> 24:50.167
-What is all this about brother?
-Ertugrul?

24:50.901 --> 24:51.901
Brother.

25:00.201 --> 25:04.901
Everything started the day you saved
the Shahzades and Halime Sultan.

25:06.601 --> 25:08.434
You made such a big mistake.

25:09.601 --> 25:14.467
Too many people from the Kayis,
the Seljuks and also the Ayyubids...

25:14.534 --> 25:18.034
...paid the price for your
mistake with their lives.

25:20.501 --> 25:22.967
Too much Muslim blood
has been shed, Ertugrul.

25:24.601 --> 25:30.701
The Templars brought
Shahzade Yigit to El Aziz themselves.

25:31.634 --> 25:32.901
Do you know why?

25:34.467 --> 25:37.667
Because they wanted
him to marry Halime Sultan.

25:40.267 --> 25:42.067
How do you know all that stuff?

25:45.201 --> 25:49.934
Halime Sultan demanded
her brother for dowry from El Aziz.

25:51.334 --> 25:53.167
So the Templars sent him.

25:54.601 --> 25:56.634
That was what we wanted to prevent.

25:57.134 --> 25:59.601
If we had managed to take the Shahzade...

26:00.301 --> 26:02.267
...we could have prevented this marriage.

26:04.101 --> 26:07.901
Unfortunately,
the situation is such, Ertugrul.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.934
What is your interest in this matter?

26:11.534 --> 26:13.967
We are on the same side, see it!

26:16.334 --> 26:20.101
You ruined the trap we set
to spoil the Templars' game!

26:20.967 --> 26:24.634
El Aziz met Halime just because of you
and now he is going to marry her!

26:26.134 --> 26:31.934
Nasir's only concern was to get
Sultan Aleaddin and Ayyubids in a war.

26:33.567 --> 26:36.101
Thanks to you, that is also accomplished!

26:37.601 --> 26:43.001
You have spoiled not only
my game, but also Sultan Aleaddin's.

26:45.501 --> 26:46.501
So?

26:47.267 --> 26:48.301
Let us...

26:49.934 --> 26:53.001
...liaise together to save
your nomad tent and the state...

26:54.601 --> 26:55.901
...from this danger.

27:10.667 --> 27:12.534
That is her lying down there, Eftelya!

27:30.001 --> 27:31.101
Nasir.

27:32.101 --> 27:33.167
Ertugrul...

27:35.267 --> 27:39.134
...will do anything he can
to prevent Halime from marrying.

27:50.067 --> 27:51.467
Keep your eyes open, Nasir!

27:52.301 --> 27:54.967
Love will be his biggest weakness, Titus.

28:01.367 --> 28:05.534
I have nothing to talk with a man
who has my Alps' blood on his hands.

28:08.301 --> 28:09.301
Ertugrul.

28:11.434 --> 28:12.934
They burned the dargah down.

28:14.534 --> 28:16.134
They killed tens of dervishes.

28:17.534 --> 28:20.334
The army will be
heading to your nomad tent...

28:20.634 --> 28:23.034
...together with
Nasir's commander Gunhan Bey.

28:23.100 --> 28:25.167
They will burn your nomad tent down.

28:31.267 --> 28:33.001
Will you just sit back and watch?

28:35.967 --> 28:39.501
Reaching the destination is impossible
by giving up the right way, Afsin Bey.

28:40.934 --> 28:46.067
You have lost your way,
just like this bastard.

28:46.701 --> 28:51.467
If you also ever dare to appear before me
again, I will walk over both of you.

29:19.034 --> 29:20.901
What are we going to do now, Kara Toygar?

29:21.701 --> 29:23.267
What we need to do.

29:26.267 --> 29:28.067
Gundogdu is a smart man.

29:29.467 --> 29:32.001
We shall not lose contact with him.

29:42.534 --> 29:45.501
{\an8}KAYI NOMAD GROUP

30:17.267 --> 30:18.534
My fellow Templars.

30:19.601 --> 30:22.401
I hope you welcome me
to your temple with open arms.

30:51.934 --> 30:55.967
You have a nomad tent,
but your homeland is uncertain.

31:01.167 --> 31:02.567
I have four sons...

31:05.101 --> 31:07.167
...but I know not
if they are dead or alive.

31:08.501 --> 31:10.067
For how much longer, Bey?

31:11.601 --> 31:12.634
For how much longer?

31:15.934 --> 31:18.134
Dundar is my youngest
pride and joy, Hayme.

31:21.401 --> 31:26.301
If he is not defeated in this bed,
the battlefields shall be afraid of him.

31:28.667 --> 31:32.167
Our other sons will return to
the nomad tent healthy and strong.

31:33.601 --> 31:35.334
You do not need to worry about it.

31:53.601 --> 31:54.634
You stand tall.

31:56.167 --> 31:59.401
Stand tall so that the nomad
group's peace shall not breach.

32:04.201 --> 32:05.667
The nomad group needs you.

32:13.001 --> 32:14.234
Giddy up!

33:23.034 --> 33:25.101
<i>The mirror that shows my reflection...</i>

33:27.367 --> 33:30.401
<i>...show me my man, Ertugrul.</i>

33:32.467 --> 33:34.634
<i>...so the fire inside me shall be put out.</i>

33:37.001 --> 33:38.667
<i>Reflect how I am to Ertugrul... ..</i>

33:40.201 --> 33:42.267
<i>...so he shall rescue me</i>
 <i>from this dungeon.</i>

34:13.234 --> 34:15.134
What if Kara Toygar told the truth?

34:20.501 --> 34:22.334
Kara Toygar has only changed his body.

34:23.367 --> 34:24.601
His soul remains the same.

34:28.334 --> 34:30.901
I do not think that
Sultan Aleaddin is trusting him.

34:32.167 --> 34:33.567
So what is he after then?

34:37.067 --> 34:38.067
We will see.

34:40.234 --> 34:42.501
But first we must capture Nasir.

34:44.001 --> 34:45.201
That is the only solution.

34:46.034 --> 34:49.101
El Aziz must have already reached
the nomad tent with his army.

34:49.301 --> 34:52.167
We need to find a way to figure
it out as soon as possible.

34:54.167 --> 34:55.901
The nanny has changed her side.

34:57.001 --> 34:58.401
I am meeting with her today.

34:59.701 --> 35:01.901
We shall decide on what to do after that.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.701
Ertugrul, you can not
go to Aleppo by yourself.

35:08.901 --> 35:12.201
If I am not back till night, you go
back to the nomad tent, brother.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.501
Do not leave my father alone.

35:15.234 --> 35:16.967
We have no other option left.

36:09.902 --> 36:12.468
<i>Dear God, I beg you</i>
 <i>with all my existence...</i>

36:12.635 --> 36:14.268
<i>...give strength to Ertugrul.</i>

36:14.335 --> 36:16.268
<i>Grant us a faithful marriage.</i>

36:16.635 --> 36:18.235
<i>You own endless possibilities.</i>

36:18.368 --> 36:20.368
<i>Grant us the blessed ones, oh God!</i>

36:30.902 --> 36:31.968
Dear God.

36:33.002 --> 36:36.802
Give patience to Halime,
give strength, oh God!

37:06.435 --> 37:11.968
Ertugrul burned Esma alive when
he realised his lies would be exposed.

37:14.868 --> 37:18.902
I tried to conceal it
so that you would not be sorry but...

37:26.435 --> 37:27.735
Your Highness The Ameer.

37:29.202 --> 37:30.868
What did the nanny tell you?

37:31.235 --> 37:33.968
What could she tell?
Ertugrul's lies, excuses.

37:36.235 --> 37:38.835
It is now out in the open
what sort of scoundrel he is.

37:39.835 --> 37:40.835
Murderer!

37:42.202 --> 37:43.235
Poor Esma.

37:44.568 --> 37:45.735
How could he kill you?

37:48.502 --> 37:49.902
And by burning, huh?

37:50.368 --> 37:51.502
Unfortunately, sir.

37:52.402 --> 37:54.268
Oh, God!

37:55.568 --> 37:58.602
But, her last words were about you.

38:00.202 --> 38:04.568
The name “El Aziz” echoed in the streets
of Aleppo in the darkness of the night.

38:11.702 --> 38:12.902
What about the dervishes?

38:14.668 --> 38:16.435
How could you kill those dervishes?

38:17.668 --> 38:19.302
My city's dervishes!

38:19.735 --> 38:21.935
Have you gone out of your mind, Nasir?

38:22.002 --> 38:27.368
Sir, They want to deviate from
the sharia law and overthrow you.

38:27.468 --> 38:29.368
For God's sake, Nasir!

38:29.435 --> 38:33.735
We have had enough of those
mystic sufis' harm to Islam, sir

38:34.802 --> 38:37.702
Those raving dervishes stood against us...

38:38.402 --> 38:40.535
...because of
your kindness towards Halebi.

38:41.302 --> 38:43.902
While we were looking
everywhere to find those Turkmens...

38:44.335 --> 38:46.935
...they dwelled in the Halebi's dargah!

38:49.568 --> 38:50.935
Your Highness The Ameer.

38:52.602 --> 38:58.302
I am afraid this matter
will lead us to Ibn'ul Arabi.

39:11.935 --> 39:12.968
Beware!

39:14.302 --> 39:16.902
If you ever mess this job up...

39:17.435 --> 39:19.668
...you will be replaced with someone else!

39:20.868 --> 39:22.568
Get this into your head, Nasir!

39:31.968 --> 39:33.268
You are excused!

39:47.535 --> 39:49.568
Your brother fell in love with Halime.

39:51.368 --> 39:56.935
Only his love can save my brother
from the debauchery he engaged in...

39:57.768 --> 39:59.535
...and the treacheries around him.

40:00.835 --> 40:02.935
Halime will love your brother, she should!

40:03.735 --> 40:04.868
She has to!

40:07.835 --> 40:10.302
We shall not overshadow
your brother's happiness.

40:10.668 --> 40:12.868
We must let him marry Halime and be happy.

40:14.935 --> 40:17.468
So they are resisting
to surrender, aren't they?

40:21.235 --> 40:23.835
Then, the army shall not wait
any longer, Commander Gunhan.

40:24.268 --> 40:27.402
I can never accept the existence
of an occupant force on my land.

40:28.002 --> 40:29.535
Go and get this job done!

40:43.335 --> 40:49.202
As I feel thankful to God when
the morning sun fills my room...

40:49.935 --> 40:54.502
...when I see you, I feel as much thankful
for granting me this light as yourself...

40:54.568 --> 40:56.668
...to this worthless servant as myself.

40:58.502 --> 41:00.535
Welcome, the Sultan of my heart!

41:02.268 --> 41:06.235
Seeing you in the early morning
hours is worth everything.

41:07.802 --> 41:10.335
You have asked me
what I wanted as a wedding gift.

41:10.968 --> 41:14.602
Order me, I shall bring
the world at your feet.

41:15.968 --> 41:21.635
Halime Sultan, you order me,
I shall prostrate myself before you.

41:23.902 --> 41:26.835
I want you to forgive the Kayis,
Your Highness The Ameer.

41:28.235 --> 41:30.002
<i>My sister will never love you.</i>

41:30.368 --> 41:33.202
She is in love with somebody else.
With my brother Ertugrul.

41:36.235 --> 41:37.902
Why do you want this from me?

41:39.668 --> 41:41.235
We owe so much to them.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.402
Any harm you do to them would hurt me.

41:48.602 --> 41:51.668
And it is not possible for them
to immigrate in the winter time.

41:53.002 --> 41:55.702
At least allow them to stay till spring.

41:57.702 --> 41:58.702
All right.

42:00.668 --> 42:02.368
As you wish, Halime Sultan.

42:04.768 --> 42:09.368
I would rather get hurt
a thousand times than hurt you.

42:11.635 --> 42:13.702
Also I do not wish
to shed any Muslim blood.

42:14.668 --> 42:18.002
I would rather have my own blood
overflowed on the streets of Aleppo...

42:18.268 --> 42:21.668
...than shed any innocent
women's and children's blood.

42:23.968 --> 42:26.802
I will show the necessary
clemency as much as I can to them.

42:27.902 --> 42:30.235
I am grateful to you,
Your Highness The Ameer.

42:30.902 --> 42:31.902
Tomorrow...

42:33.635 --> 42:36.635
...I will take you to the hunting
lodge after the wedding.

42:37.968 --> 42:39.368
It is a family tradition.

42:40.268 --> 42:44.568
The men of the dynasty take their wives
to the hunting lodge to get some rest.

42:45.768 --> 42:50.302
We would be alone together
and get to know each other better.

42:53.635 --> 42:55.468
Excuse me, Your Highness The Ameer.

42:57.402 --> 42:58.535
Halime Sultan!

42:59.535 --> 43:00.835
You haven't replied to me.

43:08.402 --> 43:10.535
However you desire,
Your Highness The Ameer.

43:23.435 --> 43:24.602
What is it, dervish?

43:25.235 --> 43:27.635
You are lost in thought constantly.

43:28.568 --> 43:30.735
Which ocean are you sailing across?

43:31.568 --> 43:33.702
Dream of which place came to your mind?

43:34.002 --> 43:35.368
Not at all, sir

43:35.768 --> 43:38.502
I am just a weak-minded,
unimaginative dervish.

43:39.535 --> 43:42.435
But the grievances of the
Muslim engage my mind.

43:42.935 --> 43:45.702
I am thinking about
the situation the Muslim world is in.

43:46.002 --> 43:49.368
We are surrounded with enemies
and to make matters worse...

43:49.702 --> 43:51.935
...Muslims clash within each other.

43:52.602 --> 43:55.268
Siblings ambush each other, they betray.

43:55.702 --> 43:59.435
They surrender their brothers to the
tyrants for the ephemeral world.

44:00.002 --> 44:02.235
I deeply resent these kind of things, sir.

44:02.602 --> 44:06.535
Whenever our prophet comes to my mind,
I feel ashamed of how we are.

44:11.202 --> 44:14.868
The earthly affairs have always
been such since our father Adam, son.

44:16.435 --> 44:18.468
There is no reason for hopelessness.

44:19.002 --> 44:24.368
Avarice and selfism
caused Cain to kill his brother.

44:24.668 --> 44:27.368
All the clashes
and the fight in the world...

44:28.268 --> 44:30.868
...started with
one brother's blood being shed

44:32.902 --> 44:36.535
Whatever the reason,
any person who sheds blood is Cain.

44:38.402 --> 44:42.268
A person who kills anybody,
kills his own brother actually.

44:43.602 --> 44:48.735
One of your brothers may be God's friend
while the other one is a murderer.

44:50.335 --> 44:53.935
If you pay attention
to Abel rather than Cain...

44:54.568 --> 44:56.935
...you would be the Joseph
who came out of the well.

45:30.768 --> 45:31.835
Done.

45:56.802 --> 46:00.202
Your letters are very successful
and convincing, Shahzade.

46:02.902 --> 46:03.902
It is obvious..

46:04.935 --> 46:08.402
...that you will get support from
the leaders of the Muslim world...

46:08.502 --> 46:10.335
...as well as the infidel world.

46:11.802 --> 46:15.268
I will be glad to announce
that you are a candidate for the throne...

46:15.335 --> 46:19.368
...when I meet
with the Turkmen Beys tomorrow.

46:20.335 --> 46:24.935
I will get you in touch with the Beys who
are eager to collaborate, Shahzade.

46:25.835 --> 46:27.435
Please wait for my report.

46:28.435 --> 46:29.435
Excuse me.

46:47.368 --> 46:48.768
How can you do this, father?

46:50.335 --> 46:53.368
How can you endanger the state
my grandfathers have established?

46:55.002 --> 46:59.435
How can you trample the
holy memory of my ancestor Seljuk...

46:59.502 --> 47:02.568
...our grandfather Alp Arslan,
Malik-Shah down like this?

47:03.268 --> 47:04.268
Halime.

47:05.568 --> 47:08.802
I am doing what is necessary, my daughter.

47:11.868 --> 47:13.702
I cannot even recognise you any more.

47:14.568 --> 47:18.435
Even that little child understood what
sort of betrayal you are involved in.

47:20.868 --> 47:22.702
But you still do not understand it.

47:24.468 --> 47:25.468
Betrayal?

47:27.468 --> 47:28.502
Betrayal, huh?

47:31.302 --> 47:36.002
You stand there and tell me
I am involved in betrayal unblushingly!

47:38.668 --> 47:41.268
You talk as if
you do not know how I struggled...

47:41.335 --> 47:44.568
...for our survival for many years!

47:46.235 --> 47:50.335
How many times did they
attempt to kill your brother and me.

47:50.602 --> 47:52.202
You were here with us.

47:53.935 --> 47:59.768
Now as you have forgotten everything, how
dare you call me to account unashamedly?

48:01.502 --> 48:03.902
Enough already! Understand?

48:07.602 --> 48:12.735
I have had enough of living
with the fear of you getting killed!

48:15.468 --> 48:18.268
From now on, I am going
to take what I deserve...

48:19.302 --> 48:20.835
...or perish trying!

48:23.302 --> 48:25.602
At least, I will not
run away like a coward.

48:26.402 --> 48:28.602
I will regain my right over the throne!

48:31.568 --> 48:32.602
I saw how...

48:35.402 --> 48:37.735
...you behaved heroically
while we were escaping...

48:38.335 --> 48:41.302
...from the murderers after us
or the states trying to use you.

48:43.268 --> 48:47.002
You fought against every
difficulty to save our state and us.

48:49.368 --> 48:50.368
And now?

48:52.302 --> 48:54.835
In fact, you are acting
like a piteous coward now!

49:01.202 --> 49:03.468
You are fluttering
desperately like a poor bird...

49:03.868 --> 49:06.002
...trapped by the people
trying to use you.

49:07.768 --> 49:09.202
What does it matter now...

49:09.835 --> 49:12.235
...if you stood before me
and roared like a lion?

49:13.935 --> 49:15.402
Shame on you, father.

49:17.535 --> 49:18.702
Shame on you.

49:35.468 --> 49:36.768
Sir, I considered Jerusalem.

49:37.735 --> 49:39.768
I considered other Muslim countries.

49:40.435 --> 49:43.002
Everybody is claiming rights
on these holy lands.

49:43.635 --> 49:47.268
The Christians fight over Jerusalem,
the Jews say “It is ours”.

49:47.702 --> 49:50.702
Everybody is claiming rights,
everybody say it is theirs, sir.

49:51.368 --> 49:52.402
Yes, son.

49:53.835 --> 49:55.968
People's delusions are never ending.

49:57.602 --> 50:00.802
God will let his righteous
servants inherit the earth.

50:01.468 --> 50:02.868
It is the God's promise.

50:03.868 --> 50:07.668
Do not be sad,
faith is the reason of hope.

50:08.902 --> 50:12.302
Everyone may see
themselves worthy of something.

50:13.235 --> 50:16.535
The people who will inherit
the earth are the ones...

50:16.635 --> 50:20.802
...whose aim is to protect
lives even in the war.

50:22.568 --> 50:25.835
Whoever is able to control
his desires during his challenge...

50:26.735 --> 50:28.835
...will be the caretaker of the premises.

50:30.468 --> 50:33.768
Whoever is
more equitable, more merciful...

50:34.968 --> 50:37.735
...will inherit that holy place.

50:39.935 --> 50:42.568
Wherever may the
tyrants name be written on...

50:43.768 --> 50:46.435
...they are doomed
to be erased as black writings.

50:46.768 --> 50:50.668
But the name of Joseph
is written on God's sign.

50:51.801 --> 50:54.502
From there it flourishes
in the humanity's heart.

50:54.835 --> 50:57.268
If God permits, sir.

50:58.468 --> 51:00.502
Come on, we have a long way to go.

51:00.568 --> 51:03.202
We have rested enough.
It is time to hit the road.

51:03.435 --> 51:05.235
-All right!
-We missed Aleppo.

51:05.502 --> 51:07.902
We see Aleppo as our homeland.

51:08.702 --> 51:11.335
The love for the homeland
is a requirement of faith.

51:19.702 --> 51:22.902
Most probably, Aleaddin's soldiers
would come from this line.

51:28.302 --> 51:29.802
Shahzade, come in.

51:33.835 --> 51:35.768
You look sad and anguished.

51:38.402 --> 51:42.368
If you tell me what the matter is,
perhaps I may do something about it.

51:48.968 --> 51:52.202
If my father gets what he deserves
and becomes the sultan...

51:52.368 --> 51:53.868
...it will be thanks to you.

51:54.602 --> 51:56.402
I will be his only successor.

51:56.468 --> 51:57.668
Of course, Shahzade.

51:58.535 --> 52:03.735
So, why am I not alongside
the Turkmens who are supporting us?

52:04.268 --> 52:05.802
Why are these hidden from me?

52:06.802 --> 52:11.902
Tomorrow I will take you to the meeting
in the Selahattin Caravanserai myself.

52:13.268 --> 52:17.602
But the Turkmens need to be
convinced first to support you father.

52:19.402 --> 52:22.002
That means Shahzade,
you need to be patient.

52:24.202 --> 52:28.935
If you want to be a great Sultan,
you will learn to be patient first.

52:53.535 --> 52:57.835
I have news, you need
to inform brother Ertugrul. Now!

52:58.202 --> 53:00.302
What news, Shahzade, tell me?

53:00.535 --> 53:03.302
Nasir is planning to start
a new war by using the Turkmens.

53:03.635 --> 53:06.302
He will be hosting them
in Selahattin Caravanserai.

53:19.902 --> 53:21.668
Good morning Selcan Hatun!

53:24.002 --> 53:26.602
Men in the trenches, women at work, eh?

53:27.668 --> 53:30.535
But you would rather not work
this hard as you are pregnant.

53:31.302 --> 53:33.602
You should put on
some weight Selcan Hatun.

53:33.835 --> 53:35.802
You need to have some milk for your baby.

53:37.335 --> 53:40.635
You should be more interested
in the army that is about to fall on us...

53:40.702 --> 53:41.902
...rather than my baby.

53:41.968 --> 53:45.935
If El Aziz attacks with his army, neither
my baby nor my nomad tent will survive.

53:47.302 --> 53:50.568
I have brought you so much
gossip and news from the marquee...

53:50.668 --> 53:54.935
...for you to be a good wolf and get this
job done, but you could not accomplish it.

53:55.202 --> 53:58.868
Because of Suleyman Shah's
improvidence and your incompetence...

53:59.368 --> 54:01.235
...we will all be under trouble.

54:11.602 --> 54:12.602
Abdurrahman!

54:39.235 --> 54:40.935
Are the weapons ready, Wild Demir?

54:42.402 --> 54:45.802
Thank goodness! They are ready Kurdoglu.

54:46.935 --> 54:49.202
Sisters will distribute
them to their owners.

54:50.468 --> 54:53.602
So, are your soldiers ready?

54:54.735 --> 54:57.635
They are all tired.
How can you expect them to be lively!

54:58.368 --> 55:02.602
You can either expect the soldiers
to kill or die unless you throw them...

55:03.468 --> 55:07.768
...into the fire or get them
chilled to the marrow, Kurdoglu!

56:03.935 --> 56:07.668
Oh holder of the earth
and the sky, oh God almighty.

56:09.202 --> 56:12.568
Definitely every servant of yours
has something they wish for from you.

56:13.202 --> 56:14.602
What I wish for is...

56:15.368 --> 56:18.735
...that you protect our nomad tent
from the encroachment of our enemies...

56:18.802 --> 56:21.468
...like you protected
the heroes in the Battle of Badr.

56:22.402 --> 56:25.268
Make us victorious against
our enemies all the time.

56:25.568 --> 56:32.468
Make the land that we came and that our
descendants will go, the land of peace.

56:33.268 --> 56:34.768
Grant us your blessing

56:35.602 --> 56:39.402
We seek refuge in you
and you alone we ask for help.

56:40.368 --> 56:41.368
Amen.

57:47.402 --> 57:50.302
They raided on the dargah
and killed the dervishes all.

57:51.535 --> 57:54.868
If Sheikh Halebi hadn't gone to
Damascus, they would have killed him too.

57:55.835 --> 57:58.302
That despicable Nasir
is so blinded with anger!

57:59.702 --> 58:02.435
Oh God, protect us
from the infidels' wrath!

58:03.935 --> 58:05.868
My brother is sitting on Nasir's tail...

58:05.935 --> 58:08.435
...they are going to
subvert the state together.

58:08.568 --> 58:10.268
And nobody sees this like we do.

58:11.635 --> 58:13.668
I do not know what to do, Leyla.

58:15.302 --> 58:16.935
Ertugrul is our only solution.

58:18.802 --> 58:22.402
Oh God help us!

59:41.702 --> 59:44.302
Hey, stop! Where to?

59:45.368 --> 59:46.968
He is my helper, oh heroes!

59:47.235 --> 59:48.435
Let him come.

01:00:08.402 --> 01:00:10.002
Woe is me, woe! Poor me!

01:00:11.835 --> 01:00:14.835
If His Highness The Malik
hears about this, he would kill me.

01:00:15.002 --> 01:00:17.968
Be calm Efraim! Remember, you owe me.

01:00:18.235 --> 01:00:21.635
My lady, you can take everything
I have but you shouldn't have done this.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.535
What are you talking about Efraim?

01:00:23.602 --> 01:00:27.268
You helped these lovers come together.
Can there be a better deed than this?

01:00:31.802 --> 01:00:34.502
You can never know how much
I missed you, Commander.

01:00:51.235 --> 01:00:54.568
You are a fearless warrior
but not a good lover.

01:00:59.768 --> 01:01:01.635
-I...
-I was worried about you.

01:01:02.435 --> 01:01:05.002
I was so scared that
something bad has happened to you.

01:01:06.568 --> 01:01:08.968
I would have already
been dead if you didn't exist.

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:13.268
We learned something new.

01:01:14.902 --> 01:01:16.802
Yigit brought us this information.

01:01:17.568 --> 01:01:18.868
Is Shahzade Yigit fine?

01:01:19.502 --> 01:01:20.602
He is very well.

01:01:21.235 --> 01:01:24.335
But the things he said about
your brother Turgut were so worrying.

01:01:25.302 --> 01:01:26.535
I know everything.

01:01:28.702 --> 01:01:31.002
-What is the information you brought?
-Nasir.

01:01:31.968 --> 01:01:33.935
He is going to meet with Oghuz tribes.

01:01:34.635 --> 01:01:37.668
His intention is to gather
the Turkmens around Shahzade Numan...

01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:40.302
...and make them rise against the Seljuks.

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:49.268
-Where will that meeting take place?
-In the Selahattin Caravanserai.

01:01:50.402 --> 01:01:51.702
I must go there immediately.

01:01:55.368 --> 01:01:56.435
This.

01:01:57.235 --> 01:01:58.868
This is very dangerous Ertugrul Bey.

01:02:00.302 --> 01:02:01.635
I must give this game away.

01:02:02.002 --> 01:02:03.368
We have no other options.

01:02:06.302 --> 01:02:07.302
Where is my uncle?

01:02:08.335 --> 01:02:09.368
Do not worry.

01:02:09.968 --> 01:02:11.268
He is in a safe place.

01:02:11.768 --> 01:02:13.968
I will bring him safe and sound to you.

01:02:24.868 --> 01:02:26.568
May God help you, son!

01:03:50.602 --> 01:03:51.868
Hold tight!

01:03:51.935 --> 01:03:57.235
Hold so tight that both the horse
and the rider shall be baffled.

01:04:01.602 --> 01:04:03.435
Come on! Up, up!

01:04:05.468 --> 01:04:08.468
First you have to hold it tight.

01:04:08.768 --> 01:04:12.268
Hold it good!
Hold the bow first, then the arrow.

01:04:22.735 --> 01:04:24.868
Aykiz, Turgut is alive.

01:04:25.468 --> 01:04:26.935
I believe it with all my heart.

01:04:27.602 --> 01:04:29.635
What keeps him alive is your love.

01:04:31.302 --> 01:04:34.535
You should hold your ground
here so he can hold his there.

01:04:35.302 --> 01:04:38.335
Ertugrul Bey has forgotten about
my Turgut long time ago Gokce.

01:04:40.002 --> 01:04:41.568
It is all about Halime!

01:04:42.668 --> 01:04:44.402
What are you talking about Aykiz?

01:04:45.502 --> 01:04:49.535
Have you not seen, how he struggled to
save the nomad tent with Gundogdu Bey?

01:04:50.435 --> 01:04:54.268
Have you not entered that bastards den,
shot arrows at their castle yourself?

01:04:55.235 --> 01:04:57.868
You are saying these
just because you love Ertugrul bey.

01:04:58.568 --> 01:05:01.635
And you do not know
what you are saying because of your pain.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:06.368
Aykiz.

01:05:07.668 --> 01:05:10.768
Ertugrul will save both
the nomad tent and Turgut.

01:05:11.768 --> 01:05:12.768
Believe me.

01:05:15.668 --> 01:05:18.802
For God's sake, Banukiz!
We are not in the rug workshop!

01:05:19.268 --> 01:05:21.668
Hold the bow correctly,
you must draw it like this!

01:05:21.735 --> 01:05:24.368
All right? Hold it good.

01:05:24.435 --> 01:05:27.502
First you draw the bow
and then release it!

01:05:30.968 --> 01:05:32.435
Come on, who is next?

01:05:32.668 --> 01:05:36.735
Do you humiliate the rug workshop girls,
because your man is held by the infidels?

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:41.835
And you probably lost your mind completely
just because your husband left, Selcan.

01:05:42.235 --> 01:05:45.535
Nobody is uttering any word to you
because you are pregnant, but not me.

01:05:47.268 --> 01:05:49.968
And I am wondering what
sort of baby is that in your tummy.

01:05:50.368 --> 01:05:52.302
.It is not getting any bigger or taller.

01:05:52.368 --> 01:05:54.968
Sister! Don't do it, please

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.235
We are all nervous.

01:05:57.535 --> 01:05:58.935
Stop mollifying, Gokce.

01:05:59.635 --> 01:06:02.568
Don't you see! How dare
she talk to a Bey's wife like that!

01:06:03.202 --> 01:06:05.902
It is time I took you down a peg or two!

01:06:07.435 --> 01:06:10.002
Someone will take
you down a peg or two so good...

01:06:10.268 --> 01:06:12.435
...that you will remember
where you came from.

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:13.902
Selcan!

01:06:16.435 --> 01:06:17.468
Aykiz.

01:07:33.502 --> 01:07:35.535
Bey, we haven't fought for a long time.

01:07:36.335 --> 01:07:38.502
Who gets bored of fighting, Alpargo?

01:07:38.935 --> 01:07:43.568
We killed or lost lives in vain
because of Suleyman Shah and Ertugrul.

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:46.602
And Gundogdu? He lost his way!

01:07:47.702 --> 01:07:50.901
If we lose, the folks will flee,
the Kayi tribe will cease to exist.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:54.435
I will fight at all costs, Alpargo.

01:07:56.235 --> 01:07:58.968
I will try to stop this from
happening without hesitation.

01:08:20.335 --> 01:08:21.502
Welcome Shah!

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.302
Draw your sword Kurdoglu!

01:10:15.702 --> 01:10:18.235
We can feel the breath
of the enemy on our napes.

01:10:18.302 --> 01:10:24.302
If we lose, our heads will beg
for mercy under the enemy's weapons.

01:10:27.002 --> 01:10:28.368
Our pride...

01:10:29.302 --> 01:10:31.968
...honor and dignity...

01:10:33.435 --> 01:10:35.535
...will be at the enemy's weapons' mercy.

01:10:36.968 --> 01:10:40.668
Now either you roar
like lions and get ready to fight...

01:10:42.202 --> 01:10:46.702
...or not only shall you lose your
independence but also everything you have.

01:10:53.435 --> 01:10:54.635
May God help us!

01:11:00.468 --> 01:11:01.835
You are good Kurdoglu.

01:11:03.268 --> 01:11:04.768
Your wrists are strong, God bless.

01:11:04.902 --> 01:11:05.935
Thank you!

01:11:10.502 --> 01:11:12.802
A commander from Aleppo
is coming to talk to you.

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:18.235
I shall meet him first,
with the soldiers of my army.

01:11:18.802 --> 01:11:20.435
Let me confront him first.

01:12:06.502 --> 01:12:08.402
Oh Atabey!

01:12:11.502 --> 01:12:13.302
You have finally found your home!

01:12:14.535 --> 01:12:18.502
I feel ashamed of myself for serving
under a man like you for years.

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.502
Not only me, but also my men.

01:12:25.635 --> 01:12:28.735
Are you also fooled by Nasir's lies?

01:12:31.268 --> 01:12:33.635
I only believe what I see, Atabey!

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:38.568
If you weren't a traitor,
you wouldn't be here now.

01:12:38.635 --> 01:12:40.802
You would be in Aleppo leading the army.

01:12:40.868 --> 01:12:44.635
Now stay out of my way, I shall
talk to Suleyman Shah for the last time.

01:12:45.268 --> 01:12:48.735
Because from now on,
only the swords will do the talking!

01:12:58.202 --> 01:12:59.602
Let them go by.

01:13:01.235 --> 01:13:03.568
Suleyman Shah
is waiting for them in his tent.

01:14:30.968 --> 01:14:31.968
Your weapon!

01:14:36.568 --> 01:14:38.802
It is alright Abdurrahman, it is alright.

01:14:40.668 --> 01:14:41.835
No need to fuss.

01:14:42.902 --> 01:14:46.402
If I wanted to behead your Shah,
you would be unable to prevent it.

01:15:21.435 --> 01:15:23.935
You carry your tents everywhere you go.

01:15:25.335 --> 01:15:28.568
However this land is not going to allow
you any longer Suleyman Shah!

01:15:29.568 --> 01:15:33.202
When are you going to stop immigrating
and find a homeland to feel at peace?

01:15:35.002 --> 01:15:37.702
We left the peace to you
among the stone walls.

01:15:38.668 --> 01:15:41.435
We left it to you so
that you could raise Cain...

01:15:41.502 --> 01:15:43.935
...thinking you are here
to stay on this world.

01:15:44.568 --> 01:15:47.535
Plant the seeds of arrogance!
Raise the icons of arrogance!

01:15:47.902 --> 01:15:51.802
Suleyman Shah, I came here
to collapse the sky around you!

01:15:52.402 --> 01:15:53.668
You disturbed our peace!

01:15:55.768 --> 01:15:57.702
I came here to to make you pay for it!

01:15:59.835 --> 01:16:01.468
We love paying for prices.

01:16:03.202 --> 01:16:07.002
We also love thrusting our swords
in sky blue and taking them out red.

01:16:08.935 --> 01:16:11.335
Your peace is going
to be disturbed many times.

01:16:11.602 --> 01:16:12.702
Oldster.

01:16:15.602 --> 01:16:18.002
I see that you are ready to be beheaded...

01:16:19.002 --> 01:16:22.335
...but I have mercy for the young boys
and girls of the nomad group.

01:16:22.502 --> 01:16:24.602
Now and for the last time...

01:16:25.568 --> 01:16:28.802
...shall deliver His Highness
The Ameer's words, and you shall listen!

01:16:29.202 --> 01:16:30.535
What is it Commander?

01:16:32.202 --> 01:16:36.735
Firstly, His Highness The Ameer
does not want to shed any Muslim blood.

01:16:37.568 --> 01:16:41.002
But he wants
his treacherous uncle and Ertugrul Bey.

01:16:42.202 --> 01:16:45.268
And then, you to unite under
his flag against Sultan Aleaddin...

01:16:45.335 --> 01:16:47.668
...like the other nomad Turkmens.

01:16:48.602 --> 01:16:52.468
And if you agree with that, you will
get a share of the gold of Aleppo.

01:16:58.635 --> 01:17:00.968
Learn the conversation
manners first, Commander!

01:17:02.502 --> 01:17:07.002
I, who you call an oldster, beheaded
so many commanders like you!

01:17:07.802 --> 01:17:10.302
And I do not hesitate
to do it again if necessary!

01:17:10.802 --> 01:17:12.002
Off you go now!

01:17:12.702 --> 01:17:17.302
Tell El Aziz that Suleyman Shah
would never give him anything.

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:23.768
Suleyman Shah would give his life
for Sultan Aleaddin if he ordered...

01:17:24.602 --> 01:17:26.802
...but wouldn't
even give a dime for El Aziz.

01:17:27.868 --> 01:17:29.968
He would pave the gold of Aleppo...

01:17:30.268 --> 01:17:32.902
...on the muddy roads of the
nomad tent instead of stones.

01:17:33.935 --> 01:17:35.202
Off you go now!

01:17:35.868 --> 01:17:38.668
It will be a pity!

01:17:39.935 --> 01:17:45.168
Suleyman, I will behead you
with my bare hands!

01:17:47.035 --> 01:17:48.268
Commander.

01:17:49.201 --> 01:17:54.301
Only God will decide our fate
when we meet in the battlefield!

01:17:55.201 --> 01:17:56.235
Off you go!

01:18:11.901 --> 01:18:13.601
What are we going to do now, Bey?

01:18:14.635 --> 01:18:16.935
We will for Ertugrul
and Gundogdu to be back.

01:18:18.635 --> 01:18:19.801
We will be patient...

01:18:20.035 --> 01:18:23.701
...till my sons tear down the dark curtain
of hypocrisy in El Aziz's eyes.

01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:26.268
This is our sole remedy.

01:18:35.301 --> 01:18:36.701
Bloody woman!

01:18:55.835 --> 01:18:56.835
Say it now.

01:18:57.635 --> 01:18:59.601
Say it, don't keep it within!

01:19:01.268 --> 01:19:02.768
Go your way, Selcan.

01:19:03.268 --> 01:19:05.101
Do not glower at me with your baby.

01:19:05.168 --> 01:19:08.235
You were just twaddling
about my baby. What happened now?

01:19:08.301 --> 01:19:11.568
Why have your tail between
your legs when you are faced with me?

01:19:11.935 --> 01:19:13.535
Selcan, I said go.

01:19:14.235 --> 01:19:15.668
Or this won't end good.

01:19:15.735 --> 01:19:17.001
This won't end good, eh?

01:19:17.535 --> 01:19:19.535
What will you do
so it is going to end bad?

01:19:24.235 --> 01:19:25.301
Say it now.

01:19:25.868 --> 01:19:28.301
Say who is going to take me
down a peg or two? Huh?

01:19:28.868 --> 01:19:32.901
Say it, where have I come from
and who is going to remind me? Huh?

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.101
Say it I say! Say it, you coward!

01:19:35.768 --> 01:19:38.535
It is easy to talk
behind me like a cheap whore.

01:19:38.901 --> 01:19:40.968
Come on, say it to my face now!

01:19:41.835 --> 01:19:44.535
Who will remind me where I come from?

01:19:44.968 --> 01:19:49.068
Or are you talking about the collaboration
between your father and Suleyman Shah...

01:19:49.168 --> 01:19:51.901
...to murder my father? Say!

01:19:53.701 --> 01:19:56.135
If you ever dare
to hit me again, I will...

01:19:59.101 --> 01:20:01.935
What will you do, huh?
What will you do to me, huh?

01:20:04.535 --> 01:20:05.601
Selcan!

01:20:08.668 --> 01:20:09.768
Selcan!

01:20:10.635 --> 01:20:13.135
Selcan are you fine?

01:20:13.201 --> 01:20:15.768
Begone! Begone I say!

01:20:17.035 --> 01:20:18.635
Oh God, what have I done?

01:20:41.735 --> 01:20:47.201
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS
THE TEMPLAR'S CASTLE

01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:06.168
We must learn
all the tricks of this trade.

01:21:07.068 --> 01:21:08.101
I do not think so.

01:21:08.168 --> 01:21:11.201
The Muslims call it “the strength
of faith”, my dear uncle.

01:21:14.001 --> 01:21:16.535
We will also deprive them of their faith.

01:21:17.235 --> 01:21:20.335
We will do it like how we stripped
Turgut off his Alp uniform...

01:21:20.568 --> 01:21:24.668
...and made him wear
the knight uniform instead of it.

01:21:44.235 --> 01:21:45.301
Kurdoglu!

01:21:48.668 --> 01:21:53.535
There are so many infidels among
them ready to sell their faith off.

01:21:55.301 --> 01:21:57.135
Well done, Judas!

01:22:06.035 --> 01:22:07.568
Let's go, Judas.

01:22:09.668 --> 01:22:11.068
You should get some rest.

01:22:56.601 --> 01:23:02.035
No fire can burn the soul of a man
like the fire of youth, Petruccio.

01:23:02.601 --> 01:23:04.301
Do you understand what I mean?

01:23:45.535 --> 01:23:50.001
Numan invited the Turkmens
to encourage them to revolt.

01:23:52.568 --> 01:23:55.068
It was obvious that
it was going to be like this.

01:23:57.101 --> 01:23:58.901
Where is this invitation to?

01:23:58.968 --> 01:24:00.568
We do not know it yet.

01:24:04.001 --> 01:24:08.001
So Shahzade Numan
agreed to collaborate with Nasir, eh?

01:24:09.935 --> 01:24:12.868
Aleaddin would not hesitate
to hit the road to Aleppo...

01:24:12.968 --> 01:24:16.168
...with his army when he hears about this.

01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:20.335
Too much blood will be shed, Afsin.

01:24:22.601 --> 01:24:25.535
This will stand the Crusaders
at most in the good stead.

01:24:26.801 --> 01:24:28.735
Do not forget about the Mongols either.

01:25:59.035 --> 01:26:03.668
Suleyman Shah, I am ready to give my life.

01:26:05.268 --> 01:26:06.868
Too many people shall not die.

01:26:10.701 --> 01:26:15.535
A guest who took shelter can not be given
to the enemy in Oghuz customs, Atabey.

01:26:16.635 --> 01:26:18.301
The arrow is already off the bow.

01:26:18.868 --> 01:26:22.035
It is going to hit
either their hearts or ours.

01:26:27.235 --> 01:26:29.001
Their army is massive, Bey.

01:26:29.335 --> 01:26:30.835
We must certainly find a way.

01:26:32.801 --> 01:26:37.068
The less may defeat the many,
don't you know Kurdoglu?

01:26:38.168 --> 01:26:39.268
I know, Bey.

01:26:39.335 --> 01:26:43.668
If you know it, your mind and
your wrists should work for the fight...

01:26:44.135 --> 01:26:47.201
instead of praising
the puissance of the enemy.

01:26:52.901 --> 01:26:55.268
You said you had
your men in the army, Atabey.

01:26:57.201 --> 01:27:00.701
Even the commander who
I trusted the most thinks I am a traitor.

01:27:02.668 --> 01:27:05.868
I would like to get out of
the nomad tent and observe the army, Bey.

01:27:05.935 --> 01:27:09.035
I want to know how many people
are there, where did they locate...

01:27:09.135 --> 01:27:10.601
...what they are doing.

01:27:10.668 --> 01:27:13.168
We should know these
in order to react accordingly.

01:27:20.168 --> 01:27:22.235
Take the Alps you trust the most with you.

01:27:23.135 --> 01:27:28.168
Bey, if you permit me, I would
like to go there alone in disguise.

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:56.868
She killed my baby!

01:27:57.201 --> 01:27:59.235
Died, my baby died!

01:28:02.768 --> 01:28:04.868
She killed my baby!

01:28:10.001 --> 01:28:13.001
Aykiz, Aykiz!

01:28:13.701 --> 01:28:19.001
She is the murderer
of my baby! Murderer!

01:28:22.168 --> 01:28:24.068
You killed my baby.

01:28:24.335 --> 01:28:26.068
Where is the murderer of my baby?

01:28:26.168 --> 01:28:27.635
I am going to kill you!

01:28:27.901 --> 01:28:29.601
She killed my baby!

01:28:29.901 --> 01:28:34.035
She did kill my baby! Where are you,
you murderer of my baby?

01:28:34.168 --> 01:28:35.835
-Sister!
-Aykiz!

01:28:36.068 --> 01:28:37.635
You killed my baby!

01:28:37.968 --> 01:28:41.701
As you have done this to me, I hope
you suffer a thousand times worse.

01:28:41.935 --> 01:28:44.068
-I am going to kill you!
-Sister!

01:28:45.135 --> 01:28:46.768
Damn you!

01:28:47.235 --> 01:28:51.335
You killed my baby, I hope
you suffer a thousand times worse.

01:28:51.835 --> 01:28:55.101
May the curse be with you!
You bloody woman!

01:28:55.668 --> 01:28:59.701
Damn you, you killed my baby!

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:03.001
Aykiz, you go to the tent.

01:29:05.068 --> 01:29:07.035
She killed him.

01:29:09.801 --> 01:29:12.268
You all saw, didn't you?
She killed my baby!

01:29:12.635 --> 01:29:15.935
She killed the son of a Bey!
She did it! Murderer!

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:18.268
-Be calm!
-All right, come, hush hush!

01:29:20.935 --> 01:29:24.768
The devil would say
"What am I to do," if he saw you!

01:29:26.835 --> 01:29:28.301
She did it again, bitch!

01:29:45.268 --> 01:29:46.568
Mother Hayme!

01:29:48.801 --> 01:29:50.968
Bey, Bey!

01:29:51.768 --> 01:29:53.035
Gokce, what happened?

01:29:54.268 --> 01:29:56.568
My sister, sister...

01:29:57.835 --> 01:29:59.635
What happened to your sister, Gokce?

01:30:00.568 --> 01:30:01.635
Her baby...

01:30:44.268 --> 01:30:46.768
That Kurdoglu I mentioned about earlier...

01:30:48.335 --> 01:30:51.201
...has sent a message
with one of the pigeons...

01:30:51.268 --> 01:30:53.601
...that Ertugrul has taken away from us.

01:30:54.301 --> 01:30:56.135
He wants to meet me.

01:30:57.201 --> 01:30:58.701
That is very good, Petruccio

01:30:58.768 --> 01:31:00.935
That means you are going
to reap what you sow.

01:31:02.168 --> 01:31:06.168
Well, has that Nasir besieged
the nomad tent with his army?

01:31:07.201 --> 01:31:08.201
Yes.

01:31:09.835 --> 01:31:11.701
That job will be done soon.

01:31:12.635 --> 01:31:13.701
And then?

01:31:16.268 --> 01:31:19.668
Everything is for Jerusalem,
isn't it Thomas?

01:31:24.701 --> 01:31:27.335
The name I am going to take
when I become the pope...

01:31:27.968 --> 01:31:30.635
...came to my mind when you said Thomas.

01:31:31.801 --> 01:31:33.301
You have an idea?

01:31:33.868 --> 01:31:35.935
I am thinking “Leo”, dear Petruccio.

01:31:37.901 --> 01:31:40.201
In which order the Leo will you be?

01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:42.134
Leo the Tenth.

01:31:44.035 --> 01:31:46.201
Well, why Leo?

01:31:46.868 --> 01:31:50.935
He was the holy man who stopped Attila
the Hunnic emperor in front of Europe.

01:31:51.668 --> 01:31:54.235
I chose this name for his holy memory.

01:31:56.535 --> 01:31:59.301
The Pope Leo the Tenth!

01:32:02.068 --> 01:32:05.768
Let's celebrate this
awesome idea of yours! Wine?

01:32:06.168 --> 01:32:07.168
Please.

01:32:07.801 --> 01:32:12.201
Well, should I take the name
Dionysus the God of wine?

01:32:13.101 --> 01:32:15.101
Dionysus the First!

01:32:15.168 --> 01:32:16.601
Dionysus the First!

01:32:27.168 --> 01:32:28.635
Suleyman Shah...

01:32:29.935 --> 01:32:32.235
...how could I kill that
innocent baby knowingly?

01:32:34.735 --> 01:32:36.568
Do not you think I fear God?

01:32:40.568 --> 01:32:43.601
Selcan does not know what
she is saying because of her pain.

01:32:47.135 --> 01:32:48.235
Selcan.

01:32:51.601 --> 01:32:53.701
Aykiz says that
she did not do it knowingly.

01:32:55.768 --> 01:32:57.701
In that case retaliation can not be made.

01:33:02.135 --> 01:33:05.035
But she will be given another
punishment upon your decision.

01:33:17.068 --> 01:33:20.635
No punishment I decide would relieve
the pain of losing my baby, father.

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:29.168
That is why I want her..

01:33:35.035 --> 01:33:36.301
...to be whipped.

01:33:44.301 --> 01:33:47.735
As I will remember my baby
whenever I see her...

01:33:50.335 --> 01:33:54.935
...she should remember what she has done
to me every time she touches her back.

01:34:31.068 --> 01:34:32.768
Tomorrow you will be...

01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:36.768
...whipped 30 times
in the nomad tent square.

01:34:45.235 --> 01:34:46.701
Do you have anything to say?

01:35:41.935 --> 01:35:43.168
I bought it for my niece.

01:35:44.001 --> 01:35:46.068
I wanted his first gift
to be from his uncle.

01:35:47.135 --> 01:35:51.568
My brother! If God permits,
we will see your children also.

01:35:52.201 --> 01:35:53.235
If God permits.

01:35:56.901 --> 01:35:58.968
-Any news, Bey?
-Yes.

01:36:00.935 --> 01:36:03.635
The Turkmen tribes
are going to unite around Numan...

01:36:03.701 --> 01:36:05.835
...and start a war against the Seljuks.

01:36:07.201 --> 01:36:09.001
So, Kara Toygar was right.

01:36:10.701 --> 01:36:13.335
If Shahzade Numan
was not deceived by Nasir's game...

01:36:13.568 --> 01:36:16.301
...they would not have made
this invitation to the Turkmens.

01:36:16.935 --> 01:36:19.601
That means, Numan is
a candidate for the Seljuk throne.

01:36:21.268 --> 01:36:22.935
What are we going to do now, Bey?

01:36:24.868 --> 01:36:26.701
We will go and prevent this war.

01:36:28.101 --> 01:36:31.135
Whatever the cost,
we will get Numan out of there.

01:36:33.868 --> 01:36:38.568
Thus, we will save
Aleppo and the nomad tent.

01:36:39.201 --> 01:36:41.701
I hope this doesn't
end up like Eftelya's end.

01:36:49.001 --> 01:36:50.101
Let's go.

01:37:03.868 --> 01:37:06.568
Thanks to you, we managed
to rescue the little Shahzade.

01:37:06.635 --> 01:37:10.035
And thus, no obstacles exist for me to
marry Halime Sultan, Ebu Hisham.

01:37:10.335 --> 01:37:12.301
Conformingly, Your Highness The Ameer.

01:37:13.135 --> 01:37:16.535
Would it be possible without
the discretion of God almighty?

01:37:16.601 --> 01:37:17.701
Thanks.

01:37:21.601 --> 01:37:25.601
But your decision to delay
Gunhan's attack the nomad tent...

01:37:25.668 --> 01:37:27.268
...has not been a good one.

01:37:28.235 --> 01:37:31.735
As you are aware,
nobody knows what tomorrow will bring.

01:37:32.535 --> 01:37:33.801
I gave Kayis another chance.

01:37:36.235 --> 01:37:38.801
And also you know that
I want to solve this matter...

01:37:38.868 --> 01:37:41.135
...without shedding
any Muslim blood, Nasir

01:37:41.701 --> 01:37:43.035
You are right, sir

01:37:43.101 --> 01:37:44.601
-But...
-But?

01:37:49.001 --> 01:37:51.301
You consult the matter
with the Turkmens, Nasir.

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:56.568
Tomorrow I am going to
marry Halime Sultan.

01:37:56.835 --> 01:37:57.901
God bless.

01:37:58.668 --> 01:38:00.768
Then we will go
to the hunting lodge together.

01:38:01.668 --> 01:38:03.101
I am so tired, Ebu Hisham.

01:38:03.935 --> 01:38:06.868
I want to work on my poems there.

01:38:08.535 --> 01:38:11.735
When I am back we can consult
the matter about the Turkmens with you.

01:38:11.801 --> 01:38:13.101
Aye, sir.

01:38:14.635 --> 01:38:17.635
The millstone around your neck
is so massive, your excellency.

01:38:17.835 --> 01:38:20.268
Anyone would be overwhelmed by it.

01:38:20.335 --> 01:38:21.601
Not at all!

01:38:58.801 --> 01:38:59.968
Selcan Hatun...

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:04.835
...may God bring you and
your children together in the afterlife.

01:39:05.901 --> 01:39:08.301
Amen, Mother Fatma, amen.

01:39:33.135 --> 01:39:34.935
Permission to come in, Selcan Hatun?

01:39:36.201 --> 01:39:37.201
Come in, Kurdoglu.

01:39:48.768 --> 01:39:50.701
I came to say I'm sorry for your loss.

01:39:52.635 --> 01:39:56.668
Nobody knows the pain of losing a child
or a loved one better than me.

01:39:57.701 --> 01:40:01.835
The Mongols killed my children and
my wife who was my heartfelt companion.

01:40:04.101 --> 01:40:06.868
What I buried in soil were
not them, it was my heart.

01:40:08.801 --> 01:40:12.001
From then on,
I have been running away from war.

01:40:16.301 --> 01:40:19.268
I would never want a family suffer
the pain of losing a child.

01:40:20.735 --> 01:40:25.068
So, you would never want a family suffer
the pain of loosing a child, Kurdoglu?

01:40:26.735 --> 01:40:27.768
Who would want it?

01:40:28.335 --> 01:40:31.101
I am an oldster with
one foot in the grave, Selcan Hatun.

01:40:32.068 --> 01:40:34.601
I would like to give
my service for the last time.

01:40:34.668 --> 01:40:36.735
Gundogdu should get what he deserves also.

01:40:37.335 --> 01:40:40.701
In order to do that,
I will meet with the Templars.

01:40:42.535 --> 01:40:46.168
If I can not get some support
against El Aziz from the Templars...

01:40:48.768 --> 01:40:54.335
...I will kill Suleyman Shah,
Ertugrul and Sahabettin...

01:40:55.635 --> 01:40:56.935
...with my bare hands.

01:41:01.801 --> 01:41:03.635
Do not ever forget these words!

01:41:06.835 --> 01:41:07.901
Excuse me.

01:41:16.068 --> 01:41:18.935
You are the killer of my child Kurdoglu.

01:41:20.801 --> 01:41:22.801
I will never forget that at heart.

01:41:24.601 --> 01:41:25.635
Never.

01:41:50.668 --> 01:41:52.768
Oh woe is me, father!

01:41:57.235 --> 01:41:59.601
While I could not bear
the pain of Turgut...

01:42:01.201 --> 01:42:03.968
...they say that I killed
the grandson of the Bey.

01:42:09.235 --> 01:42:15.101
What have I done wrong
to stumble down the well of the unknown?

01:42:24.735 --> 01:42:27.201
No need to whine, daughter.

01:42:29.701 --> 01:42:32.068
Our words are about God.

01:42:34.768 --> 01:42:38.235
The God that turned
Abraham's fire into a lake...

01:42:40.568 --> 01:42:45.568
...will have mercy on your fire some day.

01:42:47.968 --> 01:42:51.601
My dear daughter,
more beautiful than the moon.

01:42:53.935 --> 01:42:56.001
These days will pass, they will.

01:42:56.901 --> 01:43:01.635
Then you realise, you have become
a bride, those days will come.

01:43:02.168 --> 01:43:03.168
Huh?

01:43:24.801 --> 01:43:28.801
<i>I will pray for my Han</i>

01:43:30.201 --> 01:43:34.135
<i>For that, the black mountains</i>

01:43:35.668 --> 01:43:37.901
<i>Shall not collapse</i>

01:43:39.701 --> 01:43:45.868
<i>The tree of shadows shall not be cut</i>

01:43:47.868 --> 01:43:54.601
<i>The beautiful river of blood</i>
 <i>Shall not dry</i>

01:43:56.335 --> 01:44:02.635
The tip of your wings shall not break

01:44:11.568 --> 01:44:13.168
Woe my sorrowful girl.

01:44:16.835 --> 01:44:18.935
I know how it feels like to lose a child.

01:44:19.868 --> 01:44:22.001
Do not worry.

01:44:23.601 --> 01:44:27.268
May God make him your paraclete
in the afterlife, if God permits.

01:44:32.201 --> 01:44:33.668
I have been...

01:44:35.568 --> 01:44:39.835
...waiting to give
a child to my man for years.

01:44:41.768 --> 01:44:43.701
What am I going to say to Gundogdu?

01:44:44.335 --> 01:44:47.068
How am I going to say
that I lost my baby, mother?

01:44:48.535 --> 01:44:51.068
Selcan, my beautiful bride.

01:44:52.335 --> 01:44:56.701
Neither you nor Aykiz have fault in this.

01:44:57.935 --> 01:44:59.601
This is the will of God.

01:45:01.101 --> 01:45:04.668
You will see,
Gundogdu will say nothing about it.

01:45:05.935 --> 01:45:08.135
That ignoble girl went so crazy.

01:45:09.101 --> 01:45:12.168
So she killed my own baby
to get her Turgut back.

01:45:15.935 --> 01:45:18.701
How could Aykiz do this
to the Bey's grandson?

01:45:19.868 --> 01:45:22.201
How could she commit such a sin, oh girl?

01:45:26.001 --> 01:45:30.335
Have mercy,
whipping is a severe punishment.

01:45:32.168 --> 01:45:36.601
And also we shouldn't leave
Wild Demir in a difficult situation.

01:45:37.968 --> 01:45:41.268
Show mercy, daughter, so to be shown.

01:45:42.135 --> 01:45:43.701
What are you saying, mother?

01:45:44.801 --> 01:45:46.801
Are you aware of the things you say?

01:45:47.801 --> 01:45:50.901
I buried a descendant of yours in soil.

01:45:52.068 --> 01:45:55.835
Instead of saying an eye for an eye,
are you expecting me to show mercy?

01:45:57.635 --> 01:46:00.868
Woe, woe is me!

01:46:48.668 --> 01:46:49.768
My Shahzade.

01:46:50.668 --> 01:46:52.235
Yes, Your Highness The Ameer?

01:46:52.801 --> 01:46:55.801
There was something I promised
Halime Sultan as a wedding gift.

01:46:57.568 --> 01:46:59.935
I have come to say
that I have fulfilled it.

01:47:03.001 --> 01:47:05.001
I have extended the time I gave to Kayis.

01:47:12.801 --> 01:47:16.568
You are a noble-hearted
and benevolent person.

01:47:16.635 --> 01:47:17.735
God bless you.

01:47:28.268 --> 01:47:30.868
We will be off to the hunting
lodge after the wedding.

01:47:33.168 --> 01:47:36.001
I have put two odalisques
under your order, Halime Sultan.

01:47:36.601 --> 01:47:38.801
From now on, they will take care of you.

01:48:10.168 --> 01:48:14.635
My sons, for whom I have always...

01:48:16.201 --> 01:48:18.001
...prayed for to raise families...

01:48:19.168 --> 01:48:21.668
...are stuck between
the claws of the grim reaper.

01:48:24.168 --> 01:48:27.701
After my Sungurtekin whom
I have waited for to return for years...

01:48:28.568 --> 01:48:32.601
...my Dundar, my Ertugrul,
my Gundogdu...

01:48:35.735 --> 01:48:37.768
Who knows how they are now.

01:48:39.935 --> 01:48:42.235
Whilst expecting
to hold my grandson in my arms...

01:48:44.535 --> 01:48:48.234
...without feeling his smell
the black soil became his cradle.

01:48:49.535 --> 01:48:53.101
What a sorrow this is, what a misery...

01:48:56.068 --> 01:48:57.668
...what a pain, Bey!

01:49:01.135 --> 01:49:05.701
The trouble and the compassion
both come from the God almighty

01:49:07.601 --> 01:49:09.635
Holder of our sons are him also.

01:49:12.135 --> 01:49:13.801
He takes their lives if he wishes.

01:49:17.068 --> 01:49:20.068
It is our duty
to be patient for the trouble...

01:49:22.101 --> 01:49:24.268
...and be thankful
for the compassion, Hayme.

01:49:36.601 --> 01:49:38.635
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:49:40.968 --> 01:49:43.101
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:49:45.768 --> 01:49:47.868
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:50:04.935 --> 01:50:06.101
Who is that?

01:50:09.768 --> 01:50:11.835
He is from the Beydili Tribe
from Kayis, sir.

01:50:12.668 --> 01:50:14.768
Suleyman Shah's brother in law Korkut Bey.

01:50:27.535 --> 01:50:29.168
Peace be upon you, Korkut Bey

01:50:29.235 --> 01:50:30.235
Welcome.

01:50:30.868 --> 01:50:31.968
And peace be upon you.

01:50:33.301 --> 01:50:36.901
They said it was a request from the Bey
who gave grasslands to the Oghuz...

01:50:37.268 --> 01:50:38.635
...so we came.

01:50:39.101 --> 01:50:40.601
It is very kind of you.

01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:42.135
Welcome.

01:50:43.268 --> 01:50:44.635
Please welcome.

01:51:46.635 --> 01:51:48.101
Stay strong, daughter.

01:54:45.701 --> 01:54:47.101
Here is the Harem corridor.

01:54:47.168 --> 01:54:49.635
Halime Sultan's room is ahead.

01:54:49.701 --> 01:54:50.868
I must go now.

01:55:32.835 --> 01:55:33.901
All right, girls.

01:55:58.201 --> 01:56:00.768
We shall leave the father
and the daughter alone.

01:56:53.335 --> 01:56:55.268
May God grant you happiness, daughter.

01:56:57.568 --> 01:57:00.735
May God grant you a long lasting marriage.

01:57:05.035 --> 01:57:07.801
You did not give your daughter
away as a bride, father.

01:57:10.301 --> 01:57:12.668
You buried your daughter
alive in this palace.

01:57:16.035 --> 01:57:18.235
This belt I am wearing
on my bridal gown...

01:57:19.935 --> 01:57:21.835
...shall be the belt of my burial gown.

01:58:15.318 --> 01:58:17.118
You no longer have a brother.

01:58:18.751 --> 01:58:19.751
Yigit!

01:58:55.751 --> 01:58:57.784
I will take you out of here, my Shahzade.

01:58:59.851 --> 01:59:01.784
Now, take me to your father.

01:59:28.784 --> 01:59:29.984
Enough!

01:59:36.284 --> 01:59:37.784
That’s enough, I said!

01:59:52.284 --> 01:59:53.718
Take it, daughter.

01:59:53.784 --> 01:59:56.751
Drink it, drink it, daughter.

02:00:16.651 --> 02:00:19.718
<i>I have obviously</i>
 <i>cut you some slack, Selcan.</i>

02:00:21.684 --> 02:00:23.251
From now on, fear me.

02:00:26.951 --> 02:00:30.351
No mercy for the merciless!

02:01:12.818 --> 02:01:15.684
My Oghuz Beys, straight as a die!

02:01:17.851 --> 02:01:24.184
We are very glad to have you here.

02:01:27.318 --> 02:01:32.951
I have brought you the greetings and the
prayers of El Aziz, the Ameer of Aleppo.

02:01:39.618 --> 02:01:43.251
Our magnate, who
welcomes you with open arms...

02:01:43.318 --> 02:01:47.884
...despite all the hardships and the
opposition of the Bedouin tribes...

02:01:49.184 --> 02:01:55.984
...expects you to be respectful,
convivial, and loyal all the time.

02:02:03.384 --> 02:02:05.151
Thank you, Commander Nasir.

02:02:06.084 --> 02:02:11.351
But the Bayats, the Dodurgas,
the Alkaevlis, the Dogers...

02:02:11.884 --> 02:02:13.618
...and we, the Beydilis...

02:02:14.218 --> 02:02:17.918
...are from the Bozok
branch of the Oghuz tribe.

02:02:18.818 --> 02:02:23.318
We are the branches of a large family.

02:02:24.318 --> 02:02:28.784
The big mountains are not enough for our
herds and we do not fit through them.

02:02:29.184 --> 02:02:34.784
Although we are dispersed around,
we are one, thank God.

02:02:36.184 --> 02:02:37.718
Excuse our curiosity...

02:02:39.384 --> 02:02:42.351
...we would like
to know two things, immediately.

02:02:44.218 --> 02:02:46.684
Why hasn’t His Highness The Ameer,

02:02:46.751 --> 02:02:49.818
who invited so many Beys,
made it to the scene?

02:02:52.018 --> 02:02:54.251
Why hasn't he honored his guests...

02:02:54.318 --> 02:02:59.251
...even though he invited
so many Beys here on this cold winter day?

02:03:02.418 --> 02:03:06.018
His Highness The Ameer couldn't leave
Aleppo because of a good cause.

02:03:07.351 --> 02:03:13.851
He is getting married to Halime,
the daughter of the Seljuk Shahzade Numan.

02:03:42.618 --> 02:03:44.318
You have become so beautiful!

02:03:58.618 --> 02:04:00.618
Where is your father, the Shahzade?

02:04:05.184 --> 02:04:09.351
He is out having important meetings to
subvert the Seljuk State Your Highness.

02:04:31.318 --> 02:04:32.618
Yes, please.

02:04:33.151 --> 02:04:39.751
<i>Estagfurullah, Estagfurullah,</i>
 <i>Estagfurullah, e'l-azim el-kerim.</i>

02:04:40.151 --> 02:04:44.218
<i>La ilahe illallah Muhammeden resullulah.</i>

02:04:57.818 --> 02:05:00.184
The first issue we understand.

02:05:01.084 --> 02:05:05.918
Not only is His Highness The Ameer
determined to play with fire...

02:05:07.118 --> 02:05:10.051
...but also to enter the nuptial
chamber with fire, obviously.

02:05:10.418 --> 02:05:14.218
Korkut Bey, so you say, whoever
is entering the nuptial chamber...

02:05:14.951 --> 02:05:17.151
...should also be here to eat dinner.

02:05:20.751 --> 02:05:22.318
Let's proceed with the second issue.

02:05:24.051 --> 02:05:29.718
Why isn’t the worldly-wise Bey
of the Kayi Tribe, Suleyman Shah...

02:05:30.318 --> 02:05:31.784
...here with us?

02:05:34.751 --> 02:05:39.251
Moreover, we heard that you have
given them land right beside Aleppo.

02:05:42.851 --> 02:05:49.251
Suleyman Shah is not with us because
not only has he not kept his promises...

02:05:50.318 --> 02:05:53.318
...but he has collaborated
with the infidel Crusaders.

02:05:56.784 --> 02:05:57.784
Liar!

02:06:05.818 --> 02:06:07.051
Ertugrul!

02:06:19.384 --> 02:06:23.418
I, Ertugrul, son of
Suleyman Shah from the Kayi Tribe!

02:06:34.184 --> 02:06:39.018
This man is a dishonored scoundrel.

02:06:43.684 --> 02:06:45.784
He is casting aspersions upon us!

02:06:48.884 --> 02:06:50.084
His only aim...

02:06:51.218 --> 02:06:55.851
...is to make way to the Crusaders by
making brothers fight among each other!

02:06:56.318 --> 02:06:57.851
How did you get here?

02:06:58.751 --> 02:07:00.284
From whom did you receive word?

02:07:07.318 --> 02:07:11.218
Malik Aziz, son of Zahir, do you
take Halime, daughter of Numan...

02:07:11.784 --> 02:07:13.051
...to be your wife?

02:07:16.951 --> 02:07:19.251
-I do.
-Do you?

02:07:20.751 --> 02:07:22.884
-I do.
-Do you?

02:07:25.718 --> 02:07:26.884
I do.

02:07:33.118 --> 02:07:37.184
Halime, daughter of Numan, do you take
Malik Aziz, son of Malik Zahir...

02:07:37.251 --> 02:07:42.184
...to be your husband, in return for the
two towns of Aleppo, the vineyards...

02:07:42.951 --> 02:07:47.218
...and the souk of Aleppo as dowry?
