episode 8 will start at : 11:22

0:11:10.969 --> 0:11:15.502
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

0:11:16.115 --> 0:11:19.882
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

0:11:20.665 --> 0:11:23.899
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

0:11:26.223 --> 0:11:27.490
What will we do, Bey?

0:11:28.490 --> 0:11:29.723
Will we return?

0:11:31.256 --> 0:11:33.656
We cannot turn back now, Wild Demir.

0:11:35.623 --> 0:11:40.290
The tribe must have started the migration.
We should not worry them.

0:11:44.290 --> 0:11:45.490
Rahman!

0:11:49.823 --> 0:11:51.090
Yes, Bey?

0:11:51.856 --> 0:11:54.423
Is there a place we can stay around here?

0:11:54.590 --> 0:11:55.790
Have a look around.

0:11:57.256 --> 0:11:59.090
Yahya! Come with me.

0:12:16.290 --> 0:12:17.890
What will happen now, father?

0:12:18.390 --> 0:12:19.756
Won't we go to Aleppo?

0:12:20.090 --> 0:12:21.390
Do not worry, my son.

0:12:22.223 --> 0:12:25.290
Your brother Ertugrul will
bring us the news sooner or later.

0:12:25.456 --> 0:12:28.156
Then we will get to know
the truth about this issue.

0:12:37.256 --> 0:12:40.523
What did we hope when we started
the journey and look what we found.

0:12:40.723 --> 0:12:43.156
I am sure something happened to Turgut.

0:12:45.556 --> 0:12:47.623
Do not say things like that, my girl.

0:12:47.790 --> 0:12:49.490
Do not fuel your anxiety.

0:12:50.256 --> 0:12:52.156
Brave women of Kayi...

0:12:52.690 --> 0:12:55.323
...shall stand strong like a mountain...

0:12:55.756 --> 0:12:59.290
...so that the brave men of Kayi
can roar like a mountain lion.

0:13:00.656 --> 0:13:02.590
Mother Hayme is right, Aykiz.

0:13:02.890 --> 0:13:06.123
If there was a problem,
Ertugrul would have surely found us.

0:13:07.723 --> 0:13:09.856
I know that she is right as well.

0:13:11.523 --> 0:13:15.090
But this time Turgut went
without even saying good bye.

0:13:15.690 --> 0:13:17.456
That is why I feel anxious.

0:13:20.890 --> 0:13:22.490
My brave girls.

0:13:24.790 --> 0:13:26.623
Please be rest assured...

0:13:27.090 --> 0:13:30.256
...they have overcome so many battles,
so many troubles.

0:13:31.856 --> 0:13:36.890
Even if they are in trouble, even if they
are in distress, they will come back.

0:13:51.423 --> 0:13:53.756
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS TEMPLARS CASTLE

0:15:16.356 --> 0:15:18.623
Aykiz. My Aykiz.

0:15:20.356 --> 0:15:21.756
What are you doing here?

0:15:22.523 --> 0:15:25.656
Turgut. My Turgut.

0:15:34.156 --> 0:15:36.356
-Turgut.
-What are you doing here?

0:15:39.756 --> 0:15:43.223
My Aykiz? What are you doing here?

0:15:48.356 --> 0:15:51.656
My son! The voices you hear are not real!

0:15:53.190 --> 0:15:55.423
Do not surrender to them and go.

0:15:55.823 --> 0:15:57.723
Whoever you are hearing...

0:15:58.556 --> 0:16:01.790
...is not in the dungeon with you now.

0:16:05.490 --> 0:16:08.356
You have to resist the poison they gave.

0:16:10.323 --> 0:16:12.856
How? How?

0:16:15.856 --> 0:16:20.323
Hearts can only be satisfied
with reciting of God.

0:16:21.623 --> 0:16:24.723
God is your friend and
the rest is in vain.

0:16:26.190 --> 0:16:30.256
Run away from the lies they gave you
to take refuge in the truth.

0:16:31.323 --> 0:16:32.690
What do I need to do?

0:16:33.456 --> 0:16:34.790
Recite with me!

0:16:54.090 --> 0:16:55.423
My Turgut.

0:17:48.190 --> 0:17:49.556
Our journey is long.

0:17:50.523 --> 0:17:53.223
Our destination shall bring us joy,
if God permits.

0:17:55.623 --> 0:17:57.556
Come on, Hatun. You should smile.

0:17:58.323 --> 0:18:01.590
Should our child see his mother frowning
when he is born?

0:18:03.790 --> 0:18:05.223
That is it.

0:18:05.756 --> 0:18:08.523
You will give birth to our child
in our new homeland.

0:18:09.556 --> 0:18:11.823
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

0:18:12.856 --> 0:18:14.723
Aleppo will bring peace to us.

0:19:04.190 --> 0:19:06.490
Vizier, do you have a last word?

0:19:12.723 --> 0:19:14.823
Do not remember me as a traitor!

0:19:16.856 --> 0:19:20.490
Whatever I did,
I did for the future of our people.

0:19:22.723 --> 0:19:25.890
Quran is my guide and God is my witness!

0:19:27.356 --> 0:19:28.656
My head is up!

0:19:30.123 --> 0:19:31.523
My cause is God!

0:19:34.356 --> 0:19:36.590
If I need to die for this cause...

0:19:38.556 --> 0:19:40.190
...whether in sleep...

0:19:43.256 --> 0:19:44.556
...or with an axe!

0:20:43.156 --> 0:20:45.290
-Murderers!
-Liars!

0:20:59.690 --> 0:21:01.223
Great God!

0:21:20.123 --> 0:21:22.790
Stop them! Do not let Sahabettin run away!

0:21:59.690 --> 0:22:01.356
Nasir, what is happening here?

0:22:01.490 --> 0:22:04.556
Do not worry, your highness.
There are guards in every street.

0:22:04.690 --> 0:22:06.223
They cannot run anywhere.

0:22:44.723 --> 0:22:45.823
Catch him!

0:22:46.123 --> 0:22:47.890
Don't let Sahabettin run away!

0:23:24.556 --> 0:23:26.356
-Great God!
-Great God!

0:23:55.790 --> 0:23:56.890
Up!

0:24:57.256 --> 0:25:01.090
At last, Nasir.
We managed to come back to our home.

0:25:12.723 --> 0:25:16.123
Your highness, we are talking about
the snakes who sneak up into...

0:25:16.290 --> 0:25:18.890
...our warm and secure home.
We should never forget this.

0:25:19.223 --> 0:25:21.156
Please stay away from the balcony.

0:25:22.590 --> 0:25:23.823
Your highness...

0:25:24.223 --> 0:25:26.623
...you saw today what a bowman can do.

0:25:27.123 --> 0:25:29.790
God forbid, you might be
an open target in the balcony.

0:25:33.390 --> 0:25:35.590
What is happening to our precious jewel...

0:25:36.723 --> 0:25:40.390
...to our one and only Aleppo, Nasir?

0:26:24.823 --> 0:26:26.123
Behind you!

0:28:28.500 --> 0:28:33.466
Today people died right in front of me.
My uncle Sahabettin was kidnapped.

0:28:34.700 --> 0:28:39.400
A group of rascals have caused havoc
in my city.

0:28:42.466 --> 0:28:45.033
Who are the people
helping Ertugrul, Nasir?

0:28:45.233 --> 0:28:48.533
Sahabettin's collaborators,
the remainders of the Crusaders.

0:28:48.800 --> 0:28:53.200
The goons they hired. The tramps they fed.

0:28:54.033 --> 0:28:57.300
Infidels who hid themselves
under a Muslim identity.

0:28:58.400 --> 0:29:01.100
Today they united against you.

0:29:01.700 --> 0:29:04.400
Find them and bring them here, Nasir.

0:29:05.033 --> 0:29:10.066
I want to see them die in agony
with my own eyes.

0:29:10.666 --> 0:29:12.666
Do not worry, your highness.

0:29:13.500 --> 0:29:15.500
But you should still be careful.

0:29:15.733 --> 0:29:18.066
Traitors have infiltrated everywhere.

0:29:18.533 --> 0:29:21.066
Even if Sahabettin is one of them...

0:29:21.633 --> 0:29:23.500
...you can comprehend the rest.

0:29:23.666 --> 0:29:26.766
Even the least expected people
might be your enemy.

0:29:28.700 --> 0:29:31.733
Even the least expected people
might be your enemy.

0:27:53.848 --> 0:27:55.348
Thank God we meet again.

0:30:22.956 --> 0:30:24.290
What happened, brother?

0:30:26.556 --> 0:30:27.690
Nothing.

0:30:28.556 --> 0:30:30.256
I was worried about you.

0:30:31.256 --> 0:30:32.590
Are you fine, Leila?

0:30:33.890 --> 0:30:36.056
I am. But...

0:30:36.623 --> 0:30:38.323
...you do not seem so well.

0:30:39.023 --> 0:30:40.290
You look pale.

0:30:41.356 --> 0:30:42.656
Is there a problem?

0:30:44.223 --> 0:30:45.523
I am just fine...

0:30:45.990 --> 0:30:49.290
...my beautiful sister.
I am fine.

0:31:00.456 --> 0:31:01.923
Who is she?

0:31:02.590 --> 0:31:04.023
A wounded girl.

0:31:04.623 --> 0:31:08.023
When the physician said
that she needs to be looked after...

0:31:08.190 --> 0:31:11.323
...I could not turn my back.
I wanted to look after her.

0:31:11.656 --> 0:31:15.990
With God's permission, when she recovers,
she can be friends with Leila.

0:31:18.223 --> 0:31:20.023
You thought well, governess.

0:31:21.656 --> 0:31:24.023
But this news surprised me.

0:31:24.490 --> 0:31:28.990
It is known that my beautiful sister is
distant to all strangers for years.

0:31:31.556 --> 0:31:34.990
I wish it was not like this
so that I would not make you sad.

0:31:36.123 --> 0:31:40.289
Do not talk like that, my child.
Leila is trying hard to get better.

0:31:40.990 --> 0:31:43.423
We should not remind her
of such anxieties.

0:31:44.923 --> 0:31:46.623
You are right, governess.

0:31:48.490 --> 0:31:51.390
With God's permission, this poor girl...

0:31:51.623 --> 0:31:53.456
...should recover quickly.

0:31:54.940 --> 0:31:56.906
She is very beautiful. God Bless.

0:31:57.006 --> 0:31:58.506
God Bless. God Bless.

0:32:09.273 --> 0:32:10.540
My Leila...

0:32:12.140 --> 0:32:13.606
...rose of my heart.

0:32:15.240 --> 0:32:18.040
It gives me great pleasure
to see you so ardent.

0:32:51.640 --> 0:32:54.640
Where were you? You had me so worried.

0:32:56.406 --> 0:32:57.840
Governess...

0:32:58.073 --> 0:33:00.940
...they were really going to
execute my uncle.

0:33:08.606 --> 0:33:10.040
But then...

0:33:10.540 --> 0:33:12.006
...he showed up.

0:33:23.573 --> 0:33:25.506
I am very grateful to you.

0:33:25.906 --> 0:33:28.240
You jumped into a hell hole for me.

0:33:28.573 --> 0:33:31.906
Do not worry, Bey.
Us Turkmens have a saying...

0:33:32.040 --> 0:33:33.406
...you know it as well.

0:33:33.540 --> 0:33:37.406
Those who are friends with cameleers
build their door accordingly.

0:33:38.840 --> 0:33:41.640
We could not find Sahabettin and
the people who abducted him.

0:33:41.906 --> 0:33:44.273
It is as if the world split apart
and they fell in.

0:33:44.373 --> 0:33:47.506
At every street, at every corner
you shall have guards.

0:33:47.840 --> 0:33:51.573
Give special importance to places like the
lodge or bookseller where he frequented.

0:33:51.873 --> 0:33:54.206
And put extra watchmen
at the gates of the city.

0:33:54.340 --> 0:33:58.373
They should not get out of Aleppo,
whatever the cost! Understood?

0:33:59.940 --> 0:34:01.573
Is there any news about Afsin Bey?

0:34:01.840 --> 0:34:03.940
Haven't you learned how Afsin Bey is, Bey?

0:34:04.106 --> 0:34:06.440
We cannot hear from him
unless he wants us to.

0:34:06.606 --> 0:34:10.173
He put on his shroud and infiltrated
into the heartland of the infidels.

0:34:10.306 --> 0:34:14.140
We do not know whether he'd surface
in Frank territory or in a Persian city.

0:34:17.340 --> 0:34:23.140
{\an8}ANTIOCH CRUSADER COUNTSHIP

0:34:40.973 --> 0:34:43.206
What do you want from God's door,
stranger?

0:34:43.506 --> 0:34:46.873
I would like to cool down a bit
under the shadow of a pear tree.

0:34:58.873 --> 0:35:00.140
Afsin Bey?

0:35:08.073 --> 0:35:10.873
-Saltuk Kardes.
-It really is you.

0:35:12.306 --> 0:35:13.606
Come on in.

0:35:23.506 --> 0:35:25.940
Come on, tell us, Saltuk Kardes.

0:35:26.406 --> 0:35:28.873
How do the days pass at the war zone?

0:35:29.106 --> 0:35:30.540
How can they pass, Bey?

0:35:30.840 --> 0:35:36.473
Amongst these icons, I recite
the Ali Imran surah to conserve my belief.

0:35:37.440 --> 0:35:40.173
Fate loves the effort, Saltuk Kardes.

0:35:40.906 --> 0:35:44.573
A day will come when the troubles
you went through becomes a blessing.

0:35:45.340 --> 0:35:47.906
Did you bring me good news from Ahlat?

0:35:48.973 --> 0:35:51.906
Did the time come for
the holy call of the great saddhu?

0:35:52.040 --> 0:35:54.540
No, Saltuk Kardes,
the time has not come yet.

0:35:55.006 --> 0:35:58.306
But you have to take on
a very important mission at the moment.

0:35:59.506 --> 0:36:02.040
Just say it, Bey.
Your wish is my command.

0:36:02.873 --> 0:36:07.073
They imprisoned some of our people in the
Templar castle at the Amanos Mountains.

0:36:07.240 --> 0:36:09.440
I have to go in to see how they are.

0:36:10.973 --> 0:36:12.340
There is a way.

0:36:38.373 --> 0:36:40.006
It made you so handsome.

0:36:44.506 --> 0:36:46.273
You look just like a prince.

0:36:50.340 --> 0:36:52.073
Didn't you like your attire?

0:36:52.606 --> 0:36:54.373
No, I liked it very much.

0:36:56.106 --> 0:36:58.373
Are you thinking about your Turgut Agabey?

0:36:59.406 --> 0:37:01.973
Only he can take me
to my father and sister.

0:37:02.273 --> 0:37:04.940
Alright.
I will talk with my uncle for you.

0:37:05.173 --> 0:37:07.473
He surely would know
where your Turgut Agabey is.

0:37:07.606 --> 0:37:11.073
No, don't ask him.
They would put me in his cell as well.

0:37:11.906 --> 0:37:13.373
Do you know where he is?

0:37:13.540 --> 0:37:15.373
He is here. In the castle.

0:37:15.640 --> 0:37:17.573
But they treat him very badly.

0:37:19.106 --> 0:37:22.073
If Turgut Agabey wanted to,
he can beat all of the up.

0:37:22.840 --> 0:37:25.973
-He is very strong but...
-But what?

0:37:28.406 --> 0:37:31.073
But the knights tied down
his hands and feet.

0:37:32.306 --> 0:37:36.273
Maybe your Turgut Agabey committed
a big crime and that's why he is there.

0:37:36.406 --> 0:37:39.973
Never! Turgut Agabey did nothing else
but just protect me.

0:38:26.173 --> 0:38:28.373
Did you see a man
who looked like a madman?

0:38:31.373 --> 0:38:33.940
Do you mean the man
who went past before you?

0:38:34.040 --> 0:38:35.373
He went that way.

0:38:58.140 --> 0:38:59.573
I have to go upstairs, Bey.

0:38:59.840 --> 0:39:03.173
We should not leave the shop empty.
Bad eyes should not get suspicious.

0:39:03.973 --> 0:39:07.040
There is no news from my madmen,
can you ask your madmen?

0:39:07.273 --> 0:39:09.306
Where they are, is there any news?

0:39:09.473 --> 0:39:12.040
I saw the spark
in the eyes of your men, Bey.

0:39:12.173 --> 0:39:14.973
They are probably still
beating up the guards outside.

0:39:15.473 --> 0:39:18.573
You can be rest assured.
But I will still inquire about them.

0:39:25.940 --> 0:39:29.840
It is obvious that the Templars'
only aim was not killing me in the palace.

0:39:30.340 --> 0:39:33.140
What is behind the game
they are trying to play on you?

0:39:33.473 --> 0:39:36.206
Their problem is not me. It is Aleppo.

0:39:38.106 --> 0:39:42.906
When the Crusaders invaded Jerusalem,
this group called Templars came to life.

0:39:43.973 --> 0:39:47.206
They tricked the Pope and
then all the Christians.

0:39:48.573 --> 0:39:52.940
They made everyone accept that
they were the only guards of Jerusalem.

0:39:53.873 --> 0:39:57.006
They collected gold and land
from thousands of people.

0:39:58.173 --> 0:40:04.040
Then with greatness and permission of God,
Saladin Ayyubi conquered Jerusalem...

0:40:05.306 --> 0:40:07.873
...and no one cared for them anymore.

0:40:09.540 --> 0:40:14.373
So now, they are trying to regain
the reputation they had lost.

0:40:15.973 --> 0:40:20.040
That is why they try to spread venom
and create chaos everywhere.

0:40:20.840 --> 0:40:22.540
Let them play their game.

0:40:23.106 --> 0:40:25.640
We always say “tyranny spoils the game.”

0:40:27.840 --> 0:40:31.506
We shall first clear your name from
the slander you have been imposed to...

0:40:31.640 --> 0:40:34.506
...then we will hit them
when they least expect it.

0:40:40.440 --> 0:40:42.073
For the love of Jesus.

0:40:42.506 --> 0:40:45.840
Look what happened when we thought
that we got rid of Sahabettin.

0:40:46.373 --> 0:40:48.206
-Did you find a clue?
-No.

0:40:48.940 --> 0:40:52.406
But I'm looking for them in every hole.
I will find him sooner or later.

0:40:52.540 --> 0:40:55.973
I will find him and
the wild herders who saved him.

0:40:56.940 --> 0:40:59.340
What about El Aziz? Was he terrified?

0:41:02.640 --> 0:41:04.006
He was.

0:41:04.440 --> 0:41:07.973
He ran away from the those killers
and hid in his room.

0:41:10.240 --> 0:41:13.006
-But then...
-Then?

0:41:14.840 --> 0:41:16.606
He is in a strange mood.

0:41:17.240 --> 0:41:19.306
Don't neglect your visits to him.

0:41:45.240 --> 0:41:46.906
Where is our Ertugrul Bey?

0:41:59.273 --> 0:42:00.873
Under the ground.

0:42:11.073 --> 0:42:12.373
Come with me.

0:42:46.573 --> 0:42:48.206
Where were you, Dogan?

0:42:48.840 --> 0:42:54.173
You know this bear, Bey. When he sees
a fight, he can't get enough of it.

0:42:57.306 --> 0:42:59.040
You were not followed, right?

0:42:59.173 --> 0:43:00.640
Can we be followed, Bey?

0:43:00.940 --> 0:43:03.306
We also have a pair of eyes on our backs.

0:43:03.506 --> 0:43:05.306
Bamsi speaks of the truth, Bey.

0:43:05.440 --> 0:43:09.506
As he broke the arms, legs and heads
of the people who were to follow us...

0:43:09.840 --> 0:43:12.506
You have an important job
tomorrow morning.

0:43:13.340 --> 0:43:16.940
Nasir may do anything for revenge
because of the thrashing he took today.

0:43:17.106 --> 0:43:21.240
Tomorrow, you gave to go to the lodge and
take the Shahzade and Halime out of there.

0:43:32.540 --> 0:43:35.173
Who is she?
Where did she come from, governess?

0:43:35.440 --> 0:43:37.406
She was a guest at the lodge.

0:43:38.206 --> 0:43:42.506
I don't know what happened to her
but her wound was infected.

0:43:43.206 --> 0:43:47.406
When the physician said that she should be
treated in the palace, I brought her here.

0:43:48.206 --> 0:43:51.006
Yes but why did you bring her
to my room, governess?

0:43:51.873 --> 0:43:53.873
She is a poor, little girl.

0:43:54.206 --> 0:43:56.406
I hoped that she would be your friend.

0:43:57.540 --> 0:43:58.873
Leila...

0:43:59.006 --> 0:44:01.340
...if you are angry...
-Not at all!

0:44:02.040 --> 0:44:05.540
But don't you know that
I don't like to be friends with anyone?

0:44:06.340 --> 0:44:08.906
Let the poor girl come to herself first...

0:44:09.073 --> 0:44:12.140
...if you still don't want her,
we can take her to another room.

0:44:55.173 --> 0:44:59.106
Thank God you are fine. I was so worried
about you when I heard what happened.

0:45:04.106 --> 0:45:06.040
If I came at a bad time...

0:45:06.606 --> 0:45:07.973
...please, forgive me.

0:45:09.906 --> 0:45:13.873
<i>Those who hear my sighs</i>
 <i>Should ask what this noise is</i>

0:45:14.640 --> 0:45:18.873
<i>Those who are wise</i>
 <i>Should say it is the sound of love</i>

0:45:19.273 --> 0:45:21.173
<i>May my name be erased</i>

0:45:22.140 --> 0:45:23.840
<i>El Aziz be unheard</i>

0:45:24.473 --> 0:45:28.473
<i>Those who read our poems</i>
 <i>Should say a passionate nightingale</i>

0:45:32.606 --> 0:45:36.140
Magnificent. The most beautiful poem
I have heard to this day.

0:45:36.373 --> 0:45:40.406
Because the pretext was a feeling
that I had never experienced before.

0:45:44.873 --> 0:45:48.473
I have grown miserable with my yearning
for you. When everyone goes to sleep...

0:45:49.273 --> 0:45:50.373
No.

0:45:52.540 --> 0:45:54.906
I will call for you when I am available.

0:46:01.540 --> 0:46:04.440
I was succumbed by my feelings.
I didn't know my own place.

0:46:04.906 --> 0:46:07.140
Please forgive me. With your permission.

0:46:14.040 --> 0:46:15.240
My dear Esma.

0:46:16.306 --> 0:46:17.473
Poor girl.

0:47:20.273 --> 0:47:22.973
Bey? I found an inn on the way.

0:47:23.340 --> 0:47:25.473
-Is it far away?
-Not very far, Bey.

0:47:26.640 --> 0:47:28.906
We will spend the night at the inn.

0:47:29.573 --> 0:47:32.173
We will think everything through
and make a decision.

0:47:32.273 --> 0:47:35.840
You are very tired, Bey.
You know better but you should rest a bit.

0:47:41.373 --> 0:47:42.440
Come on.

0:48:00.606 --> 0:48:05.106
I am guessing that the little prince will
be more collaborative than his father.

0:48:05.340 --> 0:48:08.606
I see the treasure inside
a person with just a look in the eye...

0:48:08.906 --> 0:48:12.173
...and I never made a mistake about this,
my dear Petruccio.

0:48:12.473 --> 0:48:15.573
It is great that he found
a friend inside the castle.

0:48:15.906 --> 0:48:20.206
The more people he likes from us,
the easier our job will be.

0:48:35.906 --> 0:48:37.973
The chests can stay here, Marcus.

0:48:38.606 --> 0:48:43.540
Make sure that everything is ready
before the monks arrive.

0:48:44.640 --> 0:48:47.906
They will be more trustful
when they see the gold.

0:48:48.540 --> 0:48:51.873
-We wouldn't want to be embarrassed.
-As you wish, sir!

0:49:35.173 --> 0:49:37.573
How are you, my beautiful niece?

0:49:38.273 --> 0:49:39.440
I am fine, uncle.

0:49:40.340 --> 0:49:44.173
I am hanging out with the most handsome
man of the castle, how can I be not fine?

0:49:44.340 --> 0:49:46.840
How are you, your highness prince?

0:49:51.006 --> 0:49:52.306
I am not a prince.

0:49:52.606 --> 0:49:54.906
I am a Seljuk Shahzade.

0:50:01.240 --> 0:50:08.040
You are right, my Shahzade. Our tongues
might slip like this once in a while.

0:50:09.106 --> 0:50:11.373
Please accept my apologies.

0:50:14.506 --> 0:50:15.940
Isadora.

0:50:17.106 --> 0:50:20.173
You were a cute little girl
the last time I saw you.

0:50:20.906 --> 0:50:22.140
But now...

0:50:23.206 --> 0:50:26.073
...you have turned into
a very beautiful young woman.

0:50:26.306 --> 0:50:29.073
A sparkling, magnificent transformation.

0:50:30.540 --> 0:50:33.873
Unfortunately I could not remember you,
your highness Cardinal.

0:50:34.006 --> 0:50:35.540
So, you have seen my before.

0:50:36.640 --> 0:50:38.173
Beautiful Isadora.

0:50:39.073 --> 0:50:44.873
The last time I saw you, you were holding
the hand of my dear friend Giovanni.

0:51:17.306 --> 0:51:23.073
I will get rid of Sahabettin.
Then Ertugrul can be yours, Titus.

0:51:25.073 --> 0:51:26.373
Wasn't that so?

0:51:27.240 --> 0:51:28.606
Nasir?

0:51:30.573 --> 0:51:33.240
I don't have time for this,
come to the point.

0:51:34.873 --> 0:51:37.206
-Is there a new order from Ustad?
-Yes.

0:51:59.473 --> 0:52:01.973
Ustad wants us to start the main attack.

0:52:02.373 --> 0:52:04.606
When you run after the big glory...

0:52:05.306 --> 0:52:08.040
...these small unfinished jobs
will hold you back.

0:52:09.040 --> 0:52:11.573
If you are talking about
Sahabettin and Ertugrul...

0:52:11.906 --> 0:52:14.506
...they cannot even peek out
from the hole they are in.

0:52:14.640 --> 0:52:19.206
You know the witness you bought and made
them sing like a nightingale in court?

0:52:19.440 --> 0:52:22.273
Do you think Ertugrul will not
try to reach them?

0:52:23.173 --> 0:52:25.640
My men are in all the streets of Aleppo.

0:52:26.406 --> 0:52:29.840
Even if his shadow comes out,
we'd be onto him immediately.

0:52:30.373 --> 0:52:32.940
El Aziz is in our palm at the moment.

0:52:34.106 --> 0:52:36.840
Even if all those witnesses
come together...

0:52:37.040 --> 0:52:39.506
...his highness the Ameer
would still believe us.

0:52:40.573 --> 0:52:43.306
After all, I am his only savior.

0:52:44.540 --> 0:52:46.840
And Eftelya is his dear Esma.

0:52:52.273 --> 0:52:54.906
Nasir, Nasir, Nasir.

0:52:56.473 --> 0:52:58.473
When you speak like this...

0:52:59.140 --> 0:53:01.406
...I am reminded of Karatoygar.

0:53:04.306 --> 0:53:06.473
I hope your end won't be like his.

0:54:46.906 --> 0:54:49.273
This is a place
where God's name is recited.

0:54:50.273 --> 0:54:53.640
The dervishes think that
your manners are not befitting.

0:54:57.306 --> 0:55:02.040
What do the dervishes think about
a traitor who collaborates with infidels?

0:55:02.640 --> 0:55:06.273
His highness the Ameer believes
that his kidnappers are hiding in here.

0:55:06.473 --> 0:55:08.606
Don't try to stop our search...

0:55:09.406 --> 0:55:11.173
...then we will not use force.

0:55:14.306 --> 0:55:15.473
Let them in.

0:55:42.540 --> 0:55:45.640
If you are a God lover,
come in and have a place in our hearts...

0:55:45.906 --> 0:55:48.573
...if you are a denier,
look from the door and turn back.

0:56:13.406 --> 0:56:16.540
-Master...
-Talk, grandson of my master.

0:56:18.573 --> 0:56:20.273
Commander Nasir came.

0:56:20.973 --> 0:56:23.440
Some people saved
your dear son Sahabettin.

0:56:26.840 --> 0:56:30.606
And our child called El Aziz has believed
the things whispered to his ear...

0:56:31.073 --> 0:56:33.840
...and sent Nasir here.
-Is that so?

0:57:01.240 --> 0:57:04.273
A boy in Andalucia, with his uncle...

0:57:05.540 --> 0:57:08.406
...took some wheat to a non-Muslim miller.

0:57:09.006 --> 0:57:13.306
They were to give 100 kilos of wheat
and take 90 kilos of flour in return.

0:57:13.940 --> 0:57:17.840
And the miller was
a cheater on the scales.

0:57:18.406 --> 0:57:21.640
He weighed 80 kilos and put it in a sack.

0:57:22.640 --> 0:57:26.006
The uncle of the boy wanted
what was his right.

0:57:26.140 --> 0:57:28.306
“What kind of a man are you?” he said.

0:57:29.140 --> 0:57:31.040
They started arguing.

0:57:32.440 --> 0:57:37.073
Then the argument turned into a fight.

0:57:38.040 --> 0:57:39.940
The boy didn't know what to do.

0:57:41.306 --> 0:57:47.440
The miller and his uncle were unstoppable.
The sacks got burst...

0:57:48.940 --> 0:57:52.440
...and they were both covered
in flour from head to toe.

0:57:52.873 --> 0:57:57.973
The boy went and took a piece of stick
and stood in front of them.

0:57:59.340 --> 0:58:02.606
Which one is infidel,
which one is my uncle?

0:58:04.073 --> 0:58:06.906
Which one is infidel,
which one is my uncle?

0:58:09.606 --> 0:58:11.573
Which one is infidel...

0:58:51.006 --> 0:58:54.573
God looks at His subjects from outside
and sees what is in their heart.

0:58:56.373 --> 0:58:59.973
There are so many who are Muslim from
the outside by infidel inside...

0:59:00.106 --> 0:59:02.640
...or infidel from the outside
and Muslim within.

0:59:03.273 --> 0:59:06.940
Just like our Great God states
in the Bakarah surah.

0:59:07.373 --> 0:59:12.206
Those are the ones who have purchased
error in exchange for guidance...

0:59:12.640 --> 0:59:19.606
...so their transaction has brought
no profit, nor were they guided.

0:59:31.506 --> 0:59:35.640
Ertugrul Bey was right.
This guy called Nasir is like a rabid dog.

0:59:36.106 --> 0:59:39.106
We need to take Halime Baci
and the Shahzade out of here.

0:59:40.440 --> 0:59:43.640
That would be the best for them
and for the people in the lodge.

0:59:47.506 --> 0:59:48.640
Peace be upon you.

0:59:50.006 --> 0:59:51.140
Peace be upon you.

0:59:52.406 --> 0:59:53.840
Peace be upon you.

1:00:37.906 --> 1:00:39.573
May it be easy on you, Gundogdu.

1:00:42.540 --> 1:00:45.273
Do not tire Selcan Hatun too much.
She carries two lives...

1:00:45.406 --> 1:00:47.106
...and the voyage is hard as it is.

1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:49.440
Is it your job to think about our baby?

1:00:50.140 --> 1:00:52.173
Of course, we think about our nephew.

1:00:52.473 --> 1:00:56.106
Our blood will flow in the future
generations thanks to Gundogdu.

1:00:57.006 --> 1:01:01.373
I may not see our nephew become a Bey,
as I am an old man but...

1:01:05.173 --> 1:01:07.640
What kind of a game
are you playing now, Kurdoglu?

1:01:08.906 --> 1:01:10.173
My dear son...

1:01:10.573 --> 1:01:13.473
...I don't know how
you came to despise me so much.

1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:18.406
Yes, I did say some words to you as well,
while my blood brother was ill...

1:01:18.540 --> 1:01:23.373
...for the unity and future of our tribe.
I even resented some of your words and...

1:01:23.573 --> 1:01:25.906
...replied in an unbefitting way.

1:01:26.973 --> 1:01:30.073
But you know that I love you more than
I love your brother.

1:01:31.006 --> 1:01:33.406
It is your turn to become
the Bey of the tribe.

1:01:33.539 --> 1:01:38.073
I want this from the bottom of my heart.
I am putting everything that happened...

1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:41.273
...in the past and say that
it was due to your youth.

1:01:44.173 --> 1:01:45.473
Here you are.

1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:50.306
This honey is very valuable.

1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:54.073
Our girl Selcan should eat and be strong.

1:01:55.073 --> 1:01:57.106
May it make our nephew powerful.

1:02:03.473 --> 1:02:04.606
Thank you, uncle.

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:14.273
Kurdoglu is such a twofaced man!

1:02:42.306 --> 1:02:43.506
Peace be upon you.

1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:45.506
And peace be upon you.

1:02:56.306 --> 1:02:59.906
Our daughter Halime is in good hands
at the palace now, Numan Efendi.

1:03:00.140 --> 1:03:03.940
It is time to pray
for her to get better as soon as she can.

1:03:05.606 --> 1:03:07.006
You are right.

1:03:08.940 --> 1:03:10.173
But...

1:03:10.606 --> 1:03:13.340
...when the palace is
in turmoil like this...

1:03:14.473 --> 1:03:17.873
...leaving her and coming here
is not easy.

1:03:22.106 --> 1:03:25.640
This is the first time we are separated,
maybe since her birth.

1:03:28.273 --> 1:03:30.106
That is not the only problem.

1:03:31.173 --> 1:03:32.340
Yigit.

1:03:35.173 --> 1:03:37.506
God who has put a distance
between you today...

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:41.406
...will of course bring you together,
when the time comes. Do not worry.

1:03:46.406 --> 1:03:48.140
If you accept...

1:03:49.473 --> 1:03:52.906
...I would like to go to the palace
and give your name at the door...

1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:56.206
...to ask permission from your sister
to see my daughter.

1:03:57.540 --> 1:03:58.906
Of course.

1:04:13.916 --> 1:04:15.183
Your highness...

1:04:16.883 --> 1:04:21.916
...the famous trader I told you about,
Abu Hisam awaits to be accepted by you.

1:04:22.950 --> 1:04:24.250
Tell him to come in.

1:04:43.883 --> 1:04:46.150
Is what Nasir told me true, Abu Hisam?

1:04:46.716 --> 1:04:51.250
Do you want to undertake all our trade
in the Mediterranean region for us?

1:04:52.516 --> 1:04:54.883
Yes, your highness, I do.

1:04:55.916 --> 1:04:59.716
Why should I give you such a privilege?

1:05:01.050 --> 1:05:06.483
Make me responsible for all
the sellable goods of Emirate of Aleppo...

1:05:06.650 --> 1:05:08.650
...all its commercial ships
and caravans...

1:05:09.483 --> 1:05:12.983
...so that I can double
the income of your treasury.

1:05:13.983 --> 1:05:16.483
That is my promise, your highness.

1:05:17.783 --> 1:05:19.116
What do you say, Nasir?

1:05:21.016 --> 1:05:23.116
Can we trust Abu Hisam?

1:05:24.083 --> 1:05:29.516
Of course, your highness. He is one of
the most honest people of this world.

1:05:39.616 --> 1:05:41.950
I trust the person who you trust, Nasir.

1:05:44.083 --> 1:05:49.516
Then, all the veins of commerce
in Aleppo...

1:05:50.450 --> 1:05:53.650
...is in your hands from now on,
Abu Hisam.

1:06:28.183 --> 1:06:29.750
Where is the Shahzade?

1:06:32.516 --> 1:06:33.916
Where is Halime, Dogan?

1:06:35.683 --> 1:06:37.216
You were right, Bey.

1:06:37.583 --> 1:06:40.650
Nasir came with a platoon
to look for us in the lodge.

1:06:41.483 --> 1:06:44.450
Nasir came out of the lodge empty handed
as well as us.

1:06:44.583 --> 1:06:47.083
What are you saying, Dogan. Speak clearly.

1:06:47.650 --> 1:06:49.916
Do you mean that Halime and
her father ran away?

1:06:50.016 --> 1:06:51.916
No, Bey. But...

1:06:52.050 --> 1:06:55.716
...while we were away,
the wound of Halime Baci got worse.

1:06:57.883 --> 1:07:01.716
The people in the lodge found a contact
from the palace and brought the physician.

1:07:01.783 --> 1:07:03.250
Come to the point.

1:07:05.083 --> 1:07:06.583
Bey...

1:07:06.783 --> 1:07:08.550
...Halime Sultan...

1:07:09.650 --> 1:07:10.950
...is in the palace.

1:07:51.116 --> 1:07:56.150
You can be rest assured. You can visit her
anytime you wish, Numan Efendi.

1:07:57.583 --> 1:08:01.950
Do not worry about her state. Our girl
Halime should get up in a few days.

1:08:02.716 --> 1:08:05.383
Ummulhayr Hanim,
I am very grateful to you.

1:08:22.150 --> 1:08:24.783
Our Halime's father, Numan Efendi.

1:08:25.750 --> 1:08:28.416
Is that so? This is a great honor.

1:08:32.116 --> 1:08:33.550
I came...

1:08:34.850 --> 1:08:36.850
...to inquire the health of our guest...

1:08:37.783 --> 1:08:40.116
...and to visit my beautiful sister.

1:08:41.750 --> 1:08:44.816
Do not worry.
Our guest is looked after really well.

1:08:45.350 --> 1:08:47.583
I am hosting her personally in my room.

1:08:47.716 --> 1:08:49.083
What more can I do?

1:08:49.950 --> 1:08:52.350
My beautiful and peevish Leila.

1:08:53.116 --> 1:08:56.416
What can I do to see you smile once?

1:08:56.983 --> 1:08:59.850
You can tell me the fate of my uncle,
your highness.

1:09:03.750 --> 1:09:05.450
If you have the time...

1:09:06.450 --> 1:09:08.850
...I'd like the honor to
converse with you.

1:09:29.816 --> 1:09:34.583
I feel bad that you walk all through
Aleppo to visit your daughter.

1:09:36.083 --> 1:09:39.416
Should I assign a room in the palace
for your personal use?

1:09:40.916 --> 1:09:45.416
Then your daughter Halime can find
her father by her side anytime...

1:09:45.583 --> 1:09:50.083
-...she wants during her recovery.
-Do not trouble yourself, your highness.

1:09:51.450 --> 1:09:53.116
What trouble? Not at all.

1:12:01.653 --> 1:12:03.953
Shahzade. It is me, Shahzade.

1:12:07.220 --> 1:12:09.920
At the lodge they told us that
you went to the palace.

1:12:15.253 --> 1:12:17.020
I was very worried about you.

1:12:17.153 --> 1:12:19.053
We are fine. Do not worry.

1:12:20.553 --> 1:12:21.786
How are you?

1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:24.653
What is Halime's condition?

1:12:24.886 --> 1:12:26.720
She is still unconscious.

1:12:30.186 --> 1:12:34.920
Shahzade, you must know that the
conspiracies within the palace are...

1:12:35.020 --> 1:12:38.586
...much more dangerous than
the physical wounds of Halime.

1:12:39.753 --> 1:12:42.586
How did you throw her inside
such a ring of fire?

1:12:43.753 --> 1:12:46.320
You are right, Ertugrul. But...

1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:50.786
...Halime's situation was very critical.

1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:54.186
And just a while ago,
I talked with El Aziz.

1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:58.720
They are taking very good care of her
for her to recover.

1:13:01.053 --> 1:13:02.553
I think...

1:13:02.786 --> 1:13:05.553
...it is best that she stays
there for some time.

1:13:06.653 --> 1:13:09.820
El Aziz is nothing but a headquarters
in the hands of evil people.

1:13:10.653 --> 1:13:13.720
You might be throwing yourself
and Halime into an unknown.

1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:17.320
I wouldn't even want to think about
what they could do to you...

1:13:17.620 --> 1:13:19.653
...if they learn your real identity.

1:13:22.253 --> 1:13:24.786
That palace is a dangerous snake's nest.

1:13:25.620 --> 1:13:29.120
You have to get Halime and
yourself out from there. Believe me.

1:13:31.186 --> 1:13:32.986
I do believe you, Ertugrul.

1:13:33.686 --> 1:13:37.086
Tomorrow, I will elude El Aziz somehow
and solve this matter.

1:13:39.086 --> 1:13:41.820
What about you? What will you do?

1:13:43.586 --> 1:13:45.653
Do not worry about us, Shahzade.

1:13:46.086 --> 1:13:48.853
All the Gordian knots shall be
untied very soon.

1:14:00.953 --> 1:14:03.820
There is someone
who has captivated the mind of El Aziz.

1:14:04.286 --> 1:14:07.586
She is staying in El Aziz's sister,
Leila's room. Her name is Halime.

1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:10.886
I don't know where she came from
or who she is but I am sure that...

1:14:11.020 --> 1:14:13.753
...El Aziz is visiting her sister
just to see this girl.

1:14:13.886 --> 1:14:15.220
Are you sure, Eftelya?

1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:17.620
I told you that I saw it with my own eyes.

1:14:17.753 --> 1:14:20.753
El Aziz and the girl's father
came out of Leila's room together.

1:14:20.886 --> 1:14:23.086
He offer the man a room in the palace.

1:14:30.253 --> 1:14:34.253
Do not neglect to follow him. You should
breath on El Aziz's neck at all times.

1:14:34.986 --> 1:14:38.753
We need him to be in the palm of our hands
more than ever now.

1:14:39.253 --> 1:14:40.786
More than ever?

1:14:43.886 --> 1:14:45.819
Are you trying to tell me something?

1:14:45.953 --> 1:14:49.319
We need to silence the false witnesses
at the vizier's trial.

1:14:59.886 --> 1:15:02.953
You deal with Sahabettin's old guard in
the palace tonight.

1:15:03.853 --> 1:15:05.553
We will deal with the rest.

1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:07.920
You can say that the guards are silenced.

1:15:08.053 --> 1:15:11.786
First I have to go and save El Aziz
from drowning in the open seas.

1:15:49.586 --> 1:15:50.786
Are you looking for me?

1:16:28.753 --> 1:16:30.253
Can you stop for a moment?

1:16:34.653 --> 1:16:37.120
-Is the food for Leila Sultan?
-Yes, ma'am.

1:16:37.986 --> 1:16:41.586
-Give it to me. I shall take it.
-As you wish. Here you are.

1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:56.653
Do you have anything on your mind
as the first step, my vizier?

1:17:00.786 --> 1:17:04.886
The only thing I know is that I have to
clear my name and I have to do this...

1:17:05.020 --> 1:17:06.820
...in front of El Aziz.

1:17:08.953 --> 1:17:10.986
I have a plan in my mind, vizier.

1:17:12.186 --> 1:17:15.786
You mentioned about some witnesses
who made false claims about you.

1:17:16.086 --> 1:17:21.520
If we can catch them and make them talk
about the people who forced them...

1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:25.186
You are so smart, Ertugrul.

1:17:28.153 --> 1:17:31.653
We will be the ones who will spoil
their game, the Alps of Kayi tribe.

1:17:31.786 --> 1:17:36.320
We will first save Vizier Sahabettin
first, then the homeland of our tribe.

1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:44.853
Your hand reaches to
all parts of Aleppo, Aykutluk.

1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:48.586
Right.

1:17:51.086 --> 1:17:53.286
Can you also reach inside the palace?

1:17:56.253 --> 1:17:58.920
There are a few madmen
who can infiltrate, Bey.

1:18:00.920 --> 1:18:02.753
I didn't mean that, Aykutluk.

1:18:04.853 --> 1:18:06.286
Can you take us inside?

1:18:15.253 --> 1:18:18.820
It would have been easier if you asked
the whole of Aleppo from me, Bey.

1:18:20.186 --> 1:18:23.586
-It is difficult. Very difficult.
-Difficult...

1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:28.053
...but not impossible, is that so?

1:18:30.053 --> 1:18:32.186
Yes, Bey. That is so.

1:19:25.286 --> 1:19:28.753
May it be easy, Governess Ummulhayr.
Who is this sick girl?

1:19:30.053 --> 1:19:31.686
A guest of God, my girl.

1:19:35.253 --> 1:19:37.953
From which family is she?
I have never seen her before.

1:20:37.986 --> 1:20:40.986
Son of God was covered in blood.

1:20:42.020 --> 1:20:47.953
The crown made of thorns was more valuable
to him than the golden Roman crown.

1:20:48.553 --> 1:20:52.953
Even while he was being crucified,
even at that time, he was saying that...

1:20:53.053 --> 1:20:57.320
...he was sacrificing his body and blood
for the sins of all believers.

1:20:58.286 --> 1:21:03.220
When you reach those lands and kneel
before the memories of the Messiah...

1:21:03.653 --> 1:21:08.986
...you shall pray to save our sacred
Jerusalem invaded by the infidel Muslims!

1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:15.520
And we shall be praying here to
find the opportunity to sacrifice...

1:21:15.686 --> 1:21:19.620
...our body and blood,
just like The Messiah.

1:21:37.220 --> 1:21:39.586
His highness Cardinal Thomas.

1:21:40.953 --> 1:21:46.653
He came from the presence our holy father,
the Pope to our humble and...

1:21:47.553 --> 1:21:50.053
...distant castle
to honor his Templar brothers.

1:21:53.620 --> 1:21:57.853
I would like to introduce you to
Father Daniel, your highness cardinal.

1:22:03.253 --> 1:22:09.753
His passionate sermons enabled
many sinners to turn to The Messiah.

1:22:11.153 --> 1:22:14.053
The power of words is more important
than anything else.

1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:18.753
Just like our Holy Book says...

1:22:19.086 --> 1:22:21.120
...first there was the word.

1:22:24.253 --> 1:22:27.253
Please, sir, you are embarrassing me.

1:22:28.153 --> 1:22:34.020
At your presence, all we can do is
to fall silent. Would you like to say...

1:22:34.253 --> 1:22:40.220
...a few words to these believers who are
on the road for the sacred pilgrimage?

1:22:43.553 --> 1:22:48.786
You are all blessed souls
as you have chosen this holy path.

1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:47.120
Welcome.

1:23:49.086 --> 1:23:50.853
I thought you would not come.

1:23:51.086 --> 1:23:52.986
Aren't you happy to see me?

1:23:54.653 --> 1:23:58.053
How can I be not happy?
Why did you call me here?

1:24:00.520 --> 1:24:02.620
Why do you think I called for you?

1:24:07.320 --> 1:24:09.253
There is something I hope for...

1:24:10.020 --> 1:24:11.753
...but you wouldn't prefer us.

1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:15.753
We are not the Ameer of Aleppo.

1:24:16.753 --> 1:24:18.186
How do you know this?

1:24:19.186 --> 1:24:23.986
Didn't you think Sahabettin would track
who went in and out of his nephew's room?

1:24:24.286 --> 1:24:26.053
Did Sahabettin know as well?

1:24:29.753 --> 1:24:30.853
No.

1:24:33.286 --> 1:24:35.853
I know when and what to say to whom.

1:24:36.686 --> 1:24:39.620
You must have seen that
during the vizier's trial.

1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:43.820
Well done. I like smart men.

1:24:49.853 --> 1:24:52.220
At least, they deserve a quick death.

1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:49.520
Please allow me, my sons,
to give the sinner inside...

1:25:49.820 --> 1:25:53.620
...a part of Jesus's compassion,
who was God's lamb.

1:25:55.020 --> 1:25:58.953
The healing breath of The Messiah,
which cured many wounds...

1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:02.120
...should touch the souls of those
who suffer.

1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:06.520
Ustad's direct orders state that no one
from outside shall enter the dungeon.

1:26:06.653 --> 1:26:08.686
I am not an outsider, my son.

1:26:09.553 --> 1:26:13.053
Aren't we all moths
who fly around the same light?

1:26:14.686 --> 1:26:18.853
Wouldn't you like that light
to fall into this dark dungeon as well?

1:26:19.553 --> 1:26:20.953
Let me in, my son.

1:26:41.853 --> 1:26:47.786
Please stay and converse
with our guests, cardinal.

1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:53.620
My dear friend, Petruccio, as you will be
leaving this nice conversation behind...

1:26:53.753 --> 1:26:55.853
...I really wonder where
you shall be going.

1:26:56.020 --> 1:26:58.520
I have a small duty to fulfill.

1:26:59.653 --> 1:27:02.886
We shall continue from
where we left off when I return.

1:27:31.886 --> 1:27:35.653
-Where are we going, sir?
-The dungeon. We are going to the dungeon.

1:27:39.253 --> 1:27:41.753
My dear poor and suffering sinner.

1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:45.086
From His kingdom up in the skies...

1:27:45.220 --> 1:27:46.853
...from our Father in heaven...

1:27:47.020 --> 1:27:48.886
...I bring you rejoicing news.

1:27:49.753 --> 1:27:53.620
Go down your own way, monk.
Open your shop somewhere else.

1:27:55.586 --> 1:27:57.720
I wouldn't come near your stands.

1:28:03.953 --> 1:28:07.220
If you come close to those who follow
the path of God...

1:28:08.953 --> 1:28:10.920
...you would not regret it, my son.

1:28:12.953 --> 1:28:14.086
Afsin Bey.

1:28:17.186 --> 1:28:20.986
-What are you doing here?
-It's not the time to talk, Turgut.

1:28:27.820 --> 1:28:30.120
You are in great pain, I know.

1:28:36.753 --> 1:28:39.220
We will get you out of here
as soon as possible.

1:28:39.953 --> 1:28:41.853
May God forgive you, my son.

1:29:31.753 --> 1:29:33.086
What is happening?

1:29:37.320 --> 1:29:40.020
What are you thinking so deeply?

1:29:45.653 --> 1:29:47.786
We did not want our Bey to notice...

1:29:49.653 --> 1:29:53.286
...but being turned back from the doors
of Aleppo pierced our hearts, Wild Demir.

1:29:58.653 --> 1:30:02.620
All the troubles Kayi is going through
does not look like a blessing to us.

1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:06.220
That is why the Alps are depressed.

1:30:06.520 --> 1:30:09.820
You unwary people,
you may not trust yourselves...

1:30:09.986 --> 1:30:13.186
...you may not trust our Bey,
our Suleyman Shah...

1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:16.686
...don't you know what being an Alp means?

1:30:22.986 --> 1:30:25.753
Would an Alp be intimidated?

1:30:27.953 --> 1:30:29.586
Don't lower your heads.

1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:30.886
Look up.

1:30:34.286 --> 1:30:36.720
Now all of you gather around me now.

1:30:37.153 --> 1:30:40.186
Our stories are not
for the children all the time.

1:30:40.820 --> 1:30:44.686
This time they are granted
to big men like you!

1:30:49.653 --> 1:30:52.053
I shall tell you the story of
Master of the Alps...

1:30:52.220 --> 1:30:56.086
...bravest of all braves,
his holiness Ali's story.

1:30:58.020 --> 1:31:03.720
Once upon a time, there was
a fortress called Hyber.

1:31:06.253 --> 1:31:12.720
Our great Prophet, peace be upon him,
lived in Medina, near this fortress.

1:31:13.720 --> 1:31:17.586
The commanders of that fortress
were people with a dark soul...

1:31:17.753 --> 1:31:20.153
...siding with the evil.

1:31:22.253 --> 1:31:27.153
They did not believe our Prophet
and had a grudge against the believers.

1:31:29.686 --> 1:31:31.520
As if that was not enough...

1:31:32.186 --> 1:31:38.053
...they even dared to fight
against the Muslims...

1:31:38.320 --> 1:31:42.253
...in the Battle of Khandaq.
-The lowlifes.

1:31:43.253 --> 1:31:46.153
As time passed...

1:31:47.886 --> 1:31:49.720
...the battles ended...

1:31:50.620 --> 1:31:52.620
...and peace was sustained.

1:31:53.820 --> 1:31:55.186
Our Prophet...

1:31:56.253 --> 1:31:59.820
...wanted to conquer
the lands of these dark souls...

1:32:00.320 --> 1:32:03.686
...who stabbed the Muslims from the back.

1:32:06.253 --> 1:32:11.520
The warriors who grabbed the black flag of
Mohammed, who's a good name and person...

1:32:11.686 --> 1:32:14.153
...gathered in front of the
fortress' gate.

1:32:15.253 --> 1:32:20.986
But the fortress was on
a steep and impassible hill.

1:32:22.153 --> 1:32:24.686
Its walls were impenetrable.

1:32:25.686 --> 1:32:28.253
They tried once again, once again...

1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:32.886
...but no. They could not succeed.

1:32:35.186 --> 1:32:41.886
They lowered their heads,
rolled up the black flag of Mohammed...

1:32:43.253 --> 1:32:45.286
...and went back to our Prophet.

1:32:47.986 --> 1:32:54.053
When our Prophet saw the believers
who had lowered their heads in despair...

1:32:57.086 --> 1:33:01.320
...He said, “this flag shall be
given to its rightful owner.

1:33:05.686 --> 1:33:08.720
Then the conquest would be inevitable.

1:33:11.020 --> 1:33:18.020
That owner would never back down from
a fight, never lose hope from God!”

1:33:20.753 --> 1:33:23.586
He called the owner of the flag to
His presence.

1:33:23.753 --> 1:33:25.220
Who did He call, Master Demir?

1:33:25.520 --> 1:33:28.753
The one who swings his sword
with God's name on his tongue...

1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:31.653
...the master of the Alps,
His Holiness Ali.

1:33:34.086 --> 1:33:38.053
Ali came to His presence and
our Prophet ordered...

1:33:39.720 --> 1:33:41.886
...“go and take Hyber, Ali!”

1:33:44.020 --> 1:33:48.320
The horse's feet are fast,
the poet's tongue is cast.

1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:51.220
To cut the long story short...

1:33:51.886 --> 1:33:54.286
...God's Lion went onto Hyber!

1:33:55.053 --> 1:34:00.720
He did not hesitate from those great walls
nor from the infidel soldiers who...

1:34:00.886 --> 1:34:03.953
...breathed fire like man dragons!

1:34:04.953 --> 1:34:07.553
He reached the gate of the fortress!

1:34:07.753 --> 1:34:11.520
He took refuge in God and
barged so hard with his shoulder that...

1:34:12.020 --> 1:34:17.153
...the gate which armies couldn't demolish
came down like rotted tree trunk...

1:34:17.553 --> 1:34:19.586
...and fell down in front of him.

1:34:22.620 --> 1:34:24.220
They took the city.

1:34:27.220 --> 1:34:33.153
And they raised the black flag on
the highest tower of the fortress.

1:34:35.786 --> 1:34:41.120
Thus, it is God who did not open
the gates of Aleppo to us...

1:34:42.220 --> 1:34:48.253
...it's God who opened the gate of Hyber
to Ali when armies couldn't bring it down.

1:34:50.620 --> 1:34:55.153
Alp is such a man that when he loses
a fight, he should not feel sorry...

1:34:56.053 --> 1:34:58.920
...when he wins a fight,
he should not brag.

1:34:59.786 --> 1:35:04.553
He should know that his responsibility
is not victory but the campaign itself.

1:35:06.186 --> 1:35:11.053
He should always take refuge in God
and never refrain from trying.

1:35:13.686 --> 1:35:17.653
Only then, those who carry
the title of Alp will see that...

1:35:18.653 --> 1:35:23.953
...the gates of cities, fortresses
and hearts shall be opened to him.

1:35:25.786 --> 1:35:27.886
Let it be known like that, Alps!

1:35:29.253 --> 1:35:30.786
Let it be known.

1:35:41.253 --> 1:35:43.986
Your witness, your old guard...

1:35:44.986 --> 1:35:48.620
...our madmen found him in a state where
he won't be able to lie anymore.

1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:49.920
Nasir.

1:35:53.620 --> 1:35:56.886
We have to act fast and
reach the other witnesses before them.

1:35:57.720 --> 1:35:59.753
Come on, get up, Alps of Kayi.

1:36:04.120 --> 1:36:08.186
That Jewish trader. I can find him in
the hole he's hiding in, no matter what.

1:36:08.553 --> 1:36:10.820
You can go and check the old barkeep.

1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:12.620
Come on.

1:36:15.953 --> 1:36:18.820
Everyone in Aleppo is looking for you
at the moment.

1:36:19.086 --> 1:36:21.120
It is better for you to stay here.

1:36:25.953 --> 1:36:27.520
In the name of God.

1:36:49.586 --> 1:36:51.086
At this time of the night.

1:37:07.653 --> 1:37:09.886
I bring you news from Master Nasir.

1:37:11.220 --> 1:37:12.953
I told him before...

1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:16.753
...if you open the tavern that was closed,
it is sufficient for me.

1:37:16.986 --> 1:37:21.553
My only expectation was to revenge the
closing of my tavern, my only income...

1:37:21.686 --> 1:37:24.553
...from that enemy of fun
called Sahabettin.

1:37:24.686 --> 1:37:28.220
When you take into account the risk
I faced, I do not thing that asking for...

1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:30.786
...my tavern to be
reopened is a big reward.

1:37:35.220 --> 1:37:40.853
Master Nasir's news to you is not
about your reward but about your death.

1:38:51.953 --> 1:38:55.653
Let's pray that Aykutluk
can reach the other witness in time.

1:39:22.053 --> 1:39:27.086
Titus, did you know that our dear friend
signed a will stating that...

1:39:27.286 --> 1:39:31.320
...all his wealth shall be donated
to the Templars after his death?

1:39:33.186 --> 1:39:37.753
Maybe that is our friend's
way of repentance to crucifixion of Jesus.

1:39:39.953 --> 1:39:43.286
When we think about 1200 years of
compound interest as well...

1:39:43.620 --> 1:39:45.853
...the price he pays is acceptable.

1:39:51.553 --> 1:39:54.953
-What did you do? Did you finish him?
-Yes, sir, but...

1:39:55.986 --> 1:39:58.586
...after I killed the barkeep
and went out...

1:39:58.753 --> 1:40:01.620
...those Turkmens, Ertugrul and
his men went in.

1:40:02.053 --> 1:40:03.886
-Did they see you?
-No, sir.

1:40:04.586 --> 1:40:08.153
I ran all the way here without being seen.
I thought that I should inform you...

1:40:08.253 --> 1:40:10.286
...as quickly as possible.
-Good.

1:40:38.053 --> 1:40:41.553
Now, form a platoon from your best
and most reliable men.

1:40:42.086 --> 1:40:44.886
Take this body as well
and wait at his shop.

1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:47.953
Then come and find me again.

1:40:48.620 --> 1:40:52.586
When Ertugrul comes, we should be prepared
for a very warm welcome.

1:40:54.053 --> 1:40:55.153
Yes, sir.

1:41:02.553 --> 1:41:04.286
Titus, let us go.

1:41:05.253 --> 1:41:07.920
We have more enjoyable tasks for tonight.

1:41:29.086 --> 1:41:31.586
We failed. We couldn't reach in time.

1:41:32.820 --> 1:41:35.220
We could not catch
any of the three witnesses.

1:41:35.553 --> 1:41:36.953
What will we do now?

1:41:39.020 --> 1:41:41.586
There is a blessing in what
we see as evil...

1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:44.086
...and evil in what we see as a blessing.

1:41:44.820 --> 1:41:47.586
It is better for them to think
that they have won.

1:41:47.786 --> 1:41:50.020
Let them be complacent for now.

1:41:51.186 --> 1:41:54.120
Did you manage to arrange
our entrance to the palace, Aykutluk?

1:41:54.220 --> 1:41:55.320
I did, Bey.

1:41:56.320 --> 1:41:58.020
But it is very dangerous.

1:41:58.620 --> 1:42:01.586
It's no different from
embracing a monster.

1:42:03.053 --> 1:42:06.186
We shall set on this road,
knowing all its consequences.

1:42:07.220 --> 1:42:08.853
There is no other way.

1:42:11.253 --> 1:42:14.053
If everyone fulfills their own task...

1:42:15.253 --> 1:42:17.886
...there will not be a problem. Trust me.

1:42:28.153 --> 1:42:29.320
Yigit.

1:42:33.253 --> 1:42:34.553
Yigit.

1:42:40.286 --> 1:42:41.986
Ertugrul save Yigit.

1:42:43.220 --> 1:42:45.986
What is she saying, governess?
Who is she talking about?

1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:48.986
She was saying the same name
while we were bringing her here.

1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:51.586
It is not very understandable but...

1:42:52.820 --> 1:42:54.953
...she wants someone to save Yigit.

1:42:57.553 --> 1:42:59.053
May God help her.

1:42:59.653 --> 1:43:03.020
With God's permission,
she and her loved ones should find peace.

1:44:23.853 --> 1:44:25.253
Dogan brother...

1:44:27.153 --> 1:44:30.186
...we left our Bey all alone.
I feel really bad.

1:44:32.153 --> 1:44:35.986
If we left him alone in the fog or
in a desert, I wouldn't feel this bad.

1:44:36.720 --> 1:44:40.620
I hate this city.
There is poison in every single hole.

1:44:43.986 --> 1:44:46.820
Our Bey can take care of himself,
Bamsi brother.

1:44:47.286 --> 1:44:51.220
If you want to worry about something,
our tribe must have started the migration.

1:44:51.520 --> 1:44:54.186
Worry about where we will show
them as our homeland.

1:44:55.053 --> 1:44:59.220
Our Turgut brother is a prisoner
of the infidels, worry about him.

1:45:00.053 --> 1:45:02.853
Worry about how we will
explain this to Aykiz.

1:45:03.886 --> 1:45:06.620
What are we going to do?
I cannot tell her.

1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:09.053
I cannot bear Aykiz Baci's sorrow.

1:45:13.953 --> 1:45:16.286
Everything will be solved, Bamsi brother.

1:45:16.620 --> 1:45:17.886
God is great.

1:45:20.086 --> 1:45:23.786
You are right, Dogan brother.
Aykiz is a very strong girl.

1:45:24.220 --> 1:45:27.053
She would not cry and
throw herself left and right.

1:45:27.986 --> 1:45:31.886
Let us finish the job at hand first,
we will think about the rest later.

1:45:38.886 --> 1:45:41.786
Put these on, braves. We are going.

1:45:53.653 --> 1:45:54.753
Turgut.

1:45:57.320 --> 1:45:58.653
Turgut?

1:46:05.220 --> 1:46:06.620
Turgut.

1:46:07.686 --> 1:46:10.253
Aykiz. Aykiz, wake up.

1:46:11.086 --> 1:46:13.820
-Turgut.
-Aykiz, wake up. Wake up!

1:46:15.320 --> 1:46:18.686
-Turgut.
-It's over. It was only a dream.

1:46:19.920 --> 1:46:22.086
Gokce. Gokce.

1:46:23.020 --> 1:46:25.320
My Turgut is not well. I know.

1:46:30.753 --> 1:46:32.786
I know it in my heart.

1:46:34.086 --> 1:46:36.520
Turgut is in trouble, Gokce.

1:46:37.320 --> 1:46:38.920
Turgut is not well.

1:47:08.753 --> 1:47:10.853
We shall be as silent as the night.

1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:15.686
Do not make a sound, go slowly.

1:49:18.216 --> 1:49:19.550
Thank God.

1:49:24.616 --> 1:49:28.683
If something happened to Ertugrul
and the agreement had not reached...

1:49:28.850 --> 1:49:31.283
...the palace,
it wouldn't have been like this, Bey.

1:49:31.816 --> 1:49:35.550
It does not look like
the doings of a few guards.

1:49:36.183 --> 1:49:39.750
It is obvious that something unknown
by us is going on in Aleppo.

1:49:40.383 --> 1:49:44.050
We need to find out the reason why
we were not accepted into the city.

1:49:48.750 --> 1:49:51.183
The tent must have started the migration.

1:49:51.583 --> 1:49:54.250
We cannot sit here with our hands tied.

1:49:55.416 --> 1:49:57.650
We need to find a way to enter Aleppo.

1:50:00.216 --> 1:50:02.083
If you give permission, Bey...

1:50:02.216 --> 1:50:06.550
...can I try to enter the city all alone?
Maybe we can pass the guards this time.

1:50:08.850 --> 1:50:11.183
It does not seem likely but...

1:50:12.250 --> 1:50:14.550
...there is nothing else to do but try.

1:50:16.783 --> 1:50:18.283
I can go.

1:50:21.816 --> 1:50:23.816
If you give me permission, Bey.

1:50:28.683 --> 1:50:31.216
We do not know
what is going on in Aleppo.

1:50:31.850 --> 1:50:34.150
We cannot send you into the unknown.

1:50:35.216 --> 1:50:37.350
You know much better, Bey but...

1:50:38.050 --> 1:50:40.716
...no one would suspect
a young woman on her own.

1:50:43.183 --> 1:50:46.183
I can say that I am from another
tribe and came to the city...

1:50:46.316 --> 1:50:48.750
...to find a cure for my mother's illness.

1:50:51.716 --> 1:50:55.616
If you give permission,
I would like to accompany Aykiz.

1:50:57.850 --> 1:51:00.383
We can be more cautious
when we are together.

1:51:03.350 --> 1:51:06.450
When the situation asks for it,
the Kayi women can be...

1:51:06.616 --> 1:51:11.816
...as brave as their men
and fight as good as the Alps.

1:51:14.316 --> 1:51:15.616
Thank God.

1:51:17.716 --> 1:51:23.716
We had the chance to stand up like men
for our tribe when we were young.

1:51:25.150 --> 1:51:27.383
Bey, you know better.

1:51:31.583 --> 1:51:36.850
We know that the Kayi women have always
enabled their men to be more powerful.

1:51:38.816 --> 1:51:40.283
But...

1:51:41.083 --> 1:51:44.250
...we cannot leave our young girls
alone in a foreign land.

1:51:46.616 --> 1:51:48.250
Wild Demir...

1:51:48.450 --> 1:51:51.450
...take Aykiz and Gokce with you...

1:51:53.483 --> 1:51:55.050
...set off together.

1:51:56.783 --> 1:51:59.783
Let us pray that the guards
show mercy to a man...

1:52:00.083 --> 1:52:02.550
...who is traveling
with his daughters.

1:52:03.783 --> 1:52:05.250
Of course, Bey.

1:53:04.583 --> 1:53:06.483
The weather is getting worse.

1:53:07.216 --> 1:53:09.716
This time the journey
will test our limits.

1:53:11.616 --> 1:53:15.150
Do not worry, woman. We shall reach
Aleppo with God's permission.

1:53:19.683 --> 1:53:21.216
I am scared for my baby.

1:53:22.250 --> 1:53:25.316
How can I endure
the cold in this condition?

1:53:26.416 --> 1:53:29.250
You will.
All three of us will overcome this.

1:53:31.550 --> 1:53:34.216
Do you think they reached Aleppo?

1:53:34.383 --> 1:53:36.183
They must have, with God's permission.

1:53:36.683 --> 1:53:39.816
I wish I listened to my mother
and send you with them as well.

1:53:41.316 --> 1:53:42.716
It is better this way.

1:53:43.583 --> 1:53:46.050
To be together for better for worse.

1:53:46.350 --> 1:53:49.416
Nothing will happen to me
as long as I am with you.

1:53:53.550 --> 1:53:55.816
We should be on our way
without too much delay.

1:53:56.083 --> 1:53:57.183
Hamza!

1:54:02.716 --> 1:54:03.850
This is strange.

1:54:28.750 --> 1:54:32.183
Do you remember the address
Ertugrul gave in Aleppo, Wild Demir?

1:54:32.383 --> 1:54:34.516
A bookseller in the Aleppo market, Bey.

1:54:34.650 --> 1:54:38.216
The owner of the bookstore is
Abdulqadir El Halabi.

1:54:38.683 --> 1:54:40.616
We will ask him about Ertugrul.

1:54:46.250 --> 1:54:47.783
May God speed you.

1:54:50.650 --> 1:54:53.116
Go fast and come back fast.

1:54:56.183 --> 1:54:59.650
May the sacred hand of our Mother Fatima
be on your backs all the time.

1:54:59.750 --> 1:55:00.816
Amen.

1:55:01.350 --> 1:55:03.450
Return with good news.

1:55:03.616 --> 1:55:06.183
-May God be with you.
-Amen.

1:55:08.550 --> 1:55:09.650
Go on, my girl.

1:55:35.250 --> 1:55:37.216
God, protect them.

1:55:50.683 --> 1:55:51.783
Bey...

1:55:52.816 --> 1:55:55.216
...you seem calm like still water.

1:55:57.516 --> 1:56:03.683
Small ponds of water ripple
when a man blows a bit hard.

1:56:04.650 --> 1:56:06.816
But are the big seas like that, Alpargu?

1:56:07.283 --> 1:56:09.350
Do you not remember the Caspian Sea?

1:56:09.616 --> 1:56:13.050
It may be calm sometimes
but when it heaves up...

1:56:13.183 --> 1:56:14.683
...nothing can stop it.

1:56:15.216 --> 1:56:17.583
Do not be sad because
it is the time of the low tide now.

1:56:17.716 --> 1:56:21.383
The time will come for the high tide
and we will heave up once again.

1:56:23.483 --> 1:56:27.116
Up until this day I never doubted
even a word you said.

1:56:28.283 --> 1:56:30.616
But I do not understand
how you can be so hopeful.

1:56:30.783 --> 1:56:33.850
Whatever we tried,
we failed and returned to our tent.

1:56:34.350 --> 1:56:35.583
That is correct.

1:56:36.150 --> 1:56:37.783
You are right, Alpargu.

1:56:38.116 --> 1:56:40.783
We almost lost our own lives
while trying to take lives.

1:56:41.150 --> 1:56:43.683
But your Bey...

1:56:44.250 --> 1:56:46.250
...has not played his last card yet.

1:56:47.483 --> 1:56:50.183
We still do not have
any news from Karatoygar.

1:56:50.816 --> 1:56:54.450
Maybe Karatoygar will return
from Konya with good news.

1:56:56.416 --> 1:57:01.550
Of course the good news may mean
a wedding celebration for some...

1:57:02.516 --> 1:57:05.850
...and mourning to death for others.

1:57:55.550 --> 1:57:57.450
I am going to Leila Hanim's room.

1:57:57.650 --> 1:58:01.450
Their guest has woken up with a good
appetite. I am taking some food to her.

1:58:27.783 --> 1:58:29.383
Did you come to take him?

1:58:30.650 --> 1:58:31.750
No...

1:58:32.750 --> 1:58:34.350
...I came to take your head.

1:59:09.683 --> 1:59:11.716
Justice always prevails here.

1:59:12.850 --> 1:59:16.383
A killer who killed Aleppo's
most respected trader...

1:59:16.516 --> 1:59:19.850
...and the guards of the palace
shall surely be punished.

1:59:21.683 --> 1:59:24.583
Just like a bird,
you flew into the trap we set up for you.

1:59:24.850 --> 1:59:27.816
We don't hunt birds, we feed them.

1:59:31.250 --> 1:59:33.350
You became a game for the wolf....

1:59:34.483 --> 1:59:36.383
...while trying to hunt the bird.

1:59:56.450 --> 1:59:57.583
You!

2:00:04.816 --> 2:00:06.716
Don't think that I forgot you!

2:00:36.350 --> 2:00:37.650
Ertugrul.

2:00:41.283 --> 2:00:46.450
Put this man in the dungeon for killing
the innocent witnesses who did nothing...

2:00:46.583 --> 2:00:51.583
...but to tell the truth as well as
the guards of his highness the Ameer.

2:01:00.483 --> 2:01:02.616
When I saw so many guards here...

2:01:03.616 --> 2:01:06.116
...I was worried about the security
of the palace.

2:01:11.416 --> 2:01:12.783
What do you say, Nasir?
