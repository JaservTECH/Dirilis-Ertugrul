episode 5 will start at : 12:57

0:12:44.523 --> 0:12:49.089
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

0:12:49.688 --> 0:12:53.521
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

0:12:54.152 --> 0:12:57.485
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

0:32:24.507 --> 0:32:26.507


0:13:02.560 --> 0:13:04.860
At least say, peace be upon you.

0:13:07.193 --> 0:13:08.860
Alpargu, you go out.

0:13:23.793 --> 0:13:25.126
I was expecting you.

0:13:28.126 --> 0:13:30.260
But I was not expecting you, Gundogdu.

0:13:31.560 --> 0:13:36.893
Kurdoglu will go at night
to ambush a tent and kidnap a Shahzade...

0:13:37.760 --> 0:13:40.760
...and I will miss this party.
How can this be?

0:13:42.893 --> 0:13:47.460
Have you become a guard to the tent of
the people whom you were crying out...

0:13:47.593 --> 0:13:49.526
...for them to leave yesterday?

0:13:49.826 --> 0:13:54.226
In a tribe where you try to collect
support to become a Bey...

0:13:54.826 --> 0:13:57.126
...let us become a guard.

0:13:57.760 --> 0:13:59.026
Emmi...

0:14:00.793 --> 0:14:03.626
...this tribe should have a guard.

0:14:03.826 --> 0:14:10.026
So that bandits and dogs don’t roam
about inside the camp.

0:14:14.460 --> 0:14:17.893
Now tell me, where did you learn
this Shahzade issue?

0:14:18.926 --> 0:14:23.626
When I went to Karatoygar
as a messenger, I inquired around.

0:14:24.926 --> 0:14:26.726
I connected the dots.

0:14:26.960 --> 0:14:29.493
Why did you keep it a secret until now?

0:14:30.493 --> 0:14:36.060
The same reason as why Suleyman Shah
kept it a secret from his own son.

0:14:40.726 --> 0:14:42.060
You lie.

0:14:46.793 --> 0:14:49.826
You asked, I answered.

0:14:50.860 --> 0:14:56.126
Whoever sowed the seeds of suspicion
inside you, go and ask them!

0:14:57.193 --> 0:15:02.026
<i>Those people who you call faceless</i>
 <i>are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.</i>

0:15:02.193 --> 0:15:06.660
<i>The man called Numan is a Shahzade and</i>
 <i>that girl you look down on, is a sultan.</i>

0:15:38.760 --> 0:15:40.893
-Brother, I need to talk with you.
-Not now.

0:15:41.193 --> 0:15:43.093
-Brother!
-I said, not now, Dundar!

0:16:38.193 --> 0:16:39.560
Gundogdu...

0:16:41.726 --> 0:16:43.260
...did something bad happen?

0:16:45.460 --> 0:16:49.560
Was it you who told Kurdoglu that
Numan and his son were Shahzades, Hatun?

0:16:50.926 --> 0:16:54.093
-What happened?
-Answer me. Did you tell him or not?

0:16:54.726 --> 0:16:58.026
What Shahzade, Gundogdu?
What are you talking about?

0:16:59.226 --> 0:17:01.093
What made you so angry?

0:17:01.626 --> 0:17:04.493
Kurdoglu learned that
they are Shahzades, Hatun.

0:17:08.926 --> 0:17:10.593
What did he do then?

0:17:12.026 --> 0:17:15.193
I don’t know his intention
but he wanted to imprison them.

0:17:16.026 --> 0:17:19.060
-Where are the Shahzades?
-They left with Ertugrul.

0:17:20.793 --> 0:17:23.760
I want you to take the agreement
to El Aziz, Ertugrul.

0:17:23.893 --> 0:17:26.126
But brother,
my father gave this duty to you.

0:17:26.260 --> 0:17:28.726
Very well, and I am giving it to you.

0:17:29.760 --> 0:17:33.160
We should both do the jobs we know best,
Ertugrul. Don’t you always say...

0:17:33.460 --> 0:17:35.860
...let the headquarter be yours
and hunt mine?

0:17:38.460 --> 0:17:42.226
-And you let them go? What are you up to?
-What is it to you?

0:17:42.826 --> 0:17:46.493
-Did you tell him or not?
-I did not tell, Gundogdu.

0:17:47.493 --> 0:17:49.826
What business can I have with Kurdoglu?

0:17:51.226 --> 0:17:53.893
Did Kurdoglu tell you
that he heard it from me?

0:17:56.226 --> 0:18:01.460
He said that it was someone else.
But if it was you, Hatun...

0:18:01.660 --> 0:18:03.793
...may God be my witness that...

0:18:05.493 --> 0:18:08.760
You were not like this.
Something happened to you.

0:18:09.826 --> 0:18:13.260
Don’t you trust the woman
who is carrying your child in her womb?

0:18:13.660 --> 0:18:16.160
To your wife who is going to
give you a son?

0:18:36.826 --> 0:18:39.093
Bey, Ertugrul and his Alps have left.

0:18:39.626 --> 0:18:42.693
Round up the men you trust,
they should go after them.

0:18:44.660 --> 0:18:48.093
Tell them not to refrain from
spilling blood if needed.

0:18:48.094 --> 0:02:16.174


0:19:09.748 --> 0:19:13.248
{\an8}ALEPPO

0:19:45.968 --> 0:19:48.868
You wait around here.
I will be back shortly.

0:20:17.400 --> 0:20:18.866
Peace be upon you.

0:20:19.566 --> 0:20:21.233
And peace be upon you.

0:20:22.800 --> 0:20:26.700
I am looking for a book.
“Mawaqi al-Nujum.”

0:20:28.566 --> 0:20:33.000
The Twilight of the Stars.
Do you have it?

0:20:34.000 --> 0:20:35.333
Of course.

0:20:47.400 --> 0:20:49.833
What do you expect to learn
from that book?

0:20:50.866 --> 0:20:53.966
I am after what everyone else
is seeking to learn.

0:20:55.566 --> 0:20:59.900
I want to look in the sky and
foresee the things of tomorrow.

0:21:01.366 --> 0:21:04.633
Maybe the author did not write
the book with that intention.

0:21:06.966 --> 0:21:09.433
I want to buy this. How much is it?

0:21:14.200 --> 0:21:15.500
Accept it as a gift.

0:21:17.600 --> 0:21:20.366
In the name of God,
the Most Gracious and Most Merciful.

0:21:20.600 --> 0:21:23.466
Then I swear by the setting of the stars.

0:21:24.266 --> 0:21:26.400
And indeed, it is an oath.

0:21:27.466 --> 0:21:29.766
It is of course a valuable Book.

0:21:30.633 --> 0:21:33.533
None touch it except the purified.

0:21:35.633 --> 0:21:37.466
God always states the truth.

0:21:39.966 --> 0:21:41.633
They say that...

0:21:42.733 --> 0:21:47.400
...after the sun rises, you cannot
look at the stars to find direction.

0:21:48.800 --> 0:21:50.933
Do not dwell on the stars.

0:21:59.233 --> 0:22:00.800
If you want to see...

0:22:01.266 --> 0:22:02.833
...the Sun is in my hand.

0:22:09.766 --> 0:22:12.300
None touch it except the purified.

0:22:14.500 --> 0:22:15.833
That is the Quran.

0:22:17.200 --> 0:22:20.433
But It does not state
what will happen tomorrow.

0:22:21.666 --> 0:22:23.900
For the eyes that can see...

0:22:24.333 --> 0:22:27.933
...the secrets are Here,
as well as the secret of the secrets.

0:22:29.833 --> 0:22:35.866
The book you took just now is only
a drop from the Ocean called Quran.

0:22:36.866 --> 0:22:41.800
I never saw you before in Aleppo,
stranger. Are you from nearby?

0:22:42.866 --> 0:22:44.733
I am a poor traveler.

0:22:45.333 --> 0:22:48.933
I set off from the countries where
the sun sets to look for the country...

0:22:49.233 --> 0:22:51.200
...where the sun will rise from.

0:22:53.933 --> 0:22:57.800
I am the writer of the book
which was given as a present to you.

0:23:28.366 --> 0:23:29.666
What happened, sir?

0:23:30.566 --> 0:23:33.533
The man was Ibn Arabi.

0:23:44.600 --> 0:23:48.300
We should not be late.
People are waiting for us at the lodge.

0:25:09.866 --> 0:25:12.366
We will go by the stream,
you take the hills.

0:28:38.333 --> 0:28:39.866
Great God.

0:28:48.500 --> 0:28:50.433
Turgut, you carry on.

0:28:52.266 --> 0:28:53.333
Carry on.

0:28:58.366 --> 0:28:59.700
Shahzade, carry on.

0:29:26.533 --> 0:29:29.333
You tactless people!
What is the meaning of this?

0:29:29.800 --> 0:29:32.200
How can you shoot
an arrow at Ertugrul Bey?

0:29:32.533 --> 0:29:35.633
We do not know, Dogan.
Kurdoglu Bey gave a direct order.

0:29:35.766 --> 0:29:38.400
Surrender without a fight.
And the arrow was just a warning...

0:29:38.466 --> 0:29:40.600
...otherwise I could have hit him
right on the neck.

0:29:41.366 --> 0:29:45.633
Your tongue has overgrown! I will cut it
for you to take it back to Kurdoglu.

0:29:46.300 --> 0:29:49.466
Go back to our tribe.
I do not want to spill your blood.

0:29:49.633 --> 0:29:52.366
We don’t want to spill
the blood of our brothers as well.

0:29:52.466 --> 0:29:55.700
If you obey us and return to the tribe,
our brotherhood would continue.

0:29:55.833 --> 0:30:00.666
I shall not obey you or Kurdoglu.
I only obey my forefather’s customs.

0:30:01.400 --> 0:30:04.933
Even if Kurdoglu sends a thousand man
here, I would not give up those...

0:30:05.233 --> 0:30:07.900
...who took refuge nor
I would spill a brother’s blood.

0:34:17.299 --> 0:34:21.299
Ertugrul Bey, I hope you did not face
another trouble because of us.

0:34:21.900 --> 0:34:25.200
I prefer to be sleepless
instead of seeing a nightmare.

0:34:25.733 --> 0:34:29.233
We put you in a bad situation but
we set off early as a precaution.

0:34:30.400 --> 0:34:32.200
You are right as well.

0:34:32.433 --> 0:34:35.500
If a lion goes hunting,
it gets blamed for spilling blood...

0:34:35.633 --> 0:34:38.233
...if it lays down,
it gets blamed for being lazy.

0:34:39.366 --> 0:34:44.700
Ertugrul Bey, when we left the tent,
Gundogdu Bey was in the tent alone.

0:34:45.566 --> 0:34:47.300
Would he face a problem?

0:34:48.800 --> 0:34:52.533
Do not worry.
My brother can overcome all difficulties.

0:36:25.466 --> 0:36:29.366
Those four have died.
There is only one way for you to be saved.

0:36:29.633 --> 0:36:34.366
If you tell me where
Ertugrul Bey is going, you will be free.

0:36:36.766 --> 0:36:38.900
Aleppo. They are going to Aleppo.

0:36:55.633 --> 0:36:57.400
This much freedom is enough.

0:37:08.866 --> 0:37:11.766
Go to the castle, take the knights.

0:37:12.333 --> 0:37:14.800
We shall set a trap for them
on the Aleppo road.

0:37:15.733 --> 0:37:18.366
So he is taking the Shahzades to Aleppo.

0:38:02.533 --> 0:38:04.300
Sister, what are you saying?

0:38:10.300 --> 0:38:12.000
Sister, this thing is over.

0:38:13.200 --> 0:38:15.200
Ertugrul will never come back.

0:38:15.466 --> 0:38:18.766
How can he not come back.
His tribe, his father is here, Gokce.

0:38:19.233 --> 0:38:21.700
-Do not burn down your heart yet.
-But, sister...

0:38:27.233 --> 0:38:29.266
May you have a good morning, Master Demir.

0:38:29.366 --> 0:38:32.233
May you have a good morning, my girl.
Is Gundogdu inside?

0:38:32.300 --> 0:38:34.633
He did not sleep all night.
He must be asleep.

0:38:40.433 --> 0:38:42.766
May you have a good morning, Gundogdu Bey.

0:38:42.900 --> 0:38:45.200
May you have a good morning, Master Demir.

0:38:45.533 --> 0:38:47.733
-What is the matter?
-Not good news.

0:38:48.466 --> 0:38:49.566
Come on.

0:38:51.633 --> 0:38:54.400
Wash your face, then we have to talk.

0:38:57.566 --> 0:38:58.733
Let us talk.

0:38:59.500 --> 0:39:01.300
Your young brother Dundar...

0:39:01.733 --> 0:39:04.000
...came to me early in the morning.

0:39:05.400 --> 0:39:08.900
He wanted to say something
to Ertugrul but he did not listen.

0:39:09.600 --> 0:39:11.700
You did not listen to him either.

0:39:11.800 --> 0:39:14.633
He face was all white from fright
when I saw him.

0:39:14.766 --> 0:39:16.766
What happened? Why was he frightened?

0:39:17.933 --> 0:39:19.233
Not good news.

0:39:22.966 --> 0:39:26.833
They found Baybora’s dead body with Yigit
at the Karadere stream.

0:39:29.700 --> 0:39:31.900
-Baybora’s body?
-Yes.

0:39:32.933 --> 0:39:34.800
Who would kill him and why?

0:39:35.666 --> 0:39:39.733
I don’t know. But my mad mind
races on and thinks that...

0:39:40.633 --> 0:39:43.866
...they have lost control,
thinking the tribe’s Bey is gone.

0:39:44.633 --> 0:39:47.300
The only thing they did not have was
blood on their hands.

0:39:47.966 --> 0:39:51.666
Do not think like that,
would this tribe ever be without a Bey?

0:39:52.400 --> 0:39:57.666
Don’t worry. At the headquarters, they'll
learn that the Bey of the tribe is alive.

0:39:58.233 --> 0:39:59.500
Don’t you worry.

0:40:28.000 --> 0:40:31.633
Bey, in order to get ahead of Ertugrul
we went up the trail at Kiziltepe.

0:40:31.766 --> 0:40:34.933
When our team did not arrive,
we got suspicious and went back.

0:40:35.266 --> 0:40:37.333
When we came here, they were all dead.

0:40:38.900 --> 0:40:42.000
Alpargu, bury them all
before anyone sees them.

0:41:58.700 --> 0:42:02.466
Whatever happens, don’t forget that
you have swore obedience to Kurdoglu Bey.

0:42:02.633 --> 0:42:04.600
He is Suleyman Shah’s acting Bey.

0:42:04.900 --> 0:42:07.266
Then why are we coming here, Alpargu?

0:42:07.366 --> 0:42:10.300
What business do we have
at the headquarters called by Gundogdu?

0:42:10.433 --> 0:42:13.600
We came to give a lesson
to our Bey’s incompetent son.

0:42:14.333 --> 0:42:18.366
You support our Bey whatever happens,
that would be sufficient.

0:43:42.600 --> 0:43:43.966
Kurdoglu Bey...

0:43:45.433 --> 0:43:48.366
...Baybora’s place has been empty
for such a long time.

0:43:49.933 --> 0:43:51.900
We cannot see him in the headquarters.

0:43:53.933 --> 0:43:55.366
What happened?

0:43:56.766 --> 0:43:58.200
Where is he?

0:43:59.266 --> 0:44:00.966
I will say it before you.

0:44:03.566 --> 0:44:05.866
Last night he was found...

0:44:06.200 --> 0:44:09.333
...at the banks of Karadere stream,
stabbed to death.

0:44:17.666 --> 0:44:22.300
On the night of the day Ertugrul
came to you and inquired where he is.

0:44:22.800 --> 0:44:25.600
What do you insinuate, Gundogdu?
Talk openly.

0:44:25.833 --> 0:44:29.566
Be quiet, Alpargu. Keep your mouth shut.

0:44:32.800 --> 0:44:35.200
Your master will keep quiet as well...

0:44:36.400 --> 0:44:38.000
...I shall be talking now.

0:44:40.466 --> 0:44:42.533
You created factions within the tribe.

0:44:43.200 --> 0:44:44.533
You caused discord.

0:44:45.300 --> 0:44:47.800
You made people stone our guests’ tent.

0:44:48.633 --> 0:44:50.000
Tell me Kurdoglu...

0:44:50.400 --> 0:44:55.400
-...is attacking guests customary?
-Come to the point, Gundogdu.

0:44:56.333 --> 0:45:00.233
Are you trying to accuse the person
you called Emmi until yesterday?

0:45:00.633 --> 0:45:04.233
Aren’t you burying Suleyman Shah
even before he dies and...

0:45:04.366 --> 0:45:07.333
...go out to collect obedience
from tribe’s Beys?

0:45:08.233 --> 0:45:14.233
In our customs, questioning belongs to
the headquarters and answering to the Bey.

0:45:16.633 --> 0:45:18.266
God help us.

0:45:18.766 --> 0:45:21.700
We are not going to learn
our customs from the children.

0:45:21.900 --> 0:45:26.400
We know what headquarter members
may ask and how to answer them.

0:45:27.633 --> 0:45:30.733
You want to be Bey
and call us to account...

0:45:31.466 --> 0:45:35.466
...but you could not even steer
the caravan that was entrusted in you.

0:45:38.466 --> 0:45:41.400
You call me to account
for the death of Baybora...

0:45:42.700 --> 0:45:45.966
...but do you know what Ertugrul did?

0:46:00.733 --> 0:46:02.866
Listen to me well, Beys of Kayi.

0:46:03.900 --> 0:46:05.500
Ertugrul...

0:46:05.766 --> 0:46:09.533
...killed five warriors of our tribe.
-That is a lie!

0:46:12.833 --> 0:46:14.333
This is slander.

0:46:15.666 --> 0:46:18.333
Mother Hayme, Ertugrul would
never do such a thing.

0:46:19.600 --> 0:46:22.633
This shameless person
has lost control, my girl.

0:46:23.533 --> 0:46:27.233
The slanders are only
a reflection of his own dark heart.

0:46:29.300 --> 0:46:30.666
And thus...

0:46:30.933 --> 0:46:34.933
...Gundogdu who caused our Alps
to die in the caravan ambush...

0:46:35.433 --> 0:46:39.666
...and Ertugrul who slayed our Alps
cannot challenge me at all!

0:46:40.200 --> 0:46:42.300
Decency, Kurdoglu, decency!

0:46:42.766 --> 0:46:43.800
Enough!

0:46:47.333 --> 0:46:51.700
Aren’t you ashamed of
slandering our Bey’s sons?

0:46:52.433 --> 0:46:53.933
Don’t you have shame?

0:46:55.900 --> 0:46:58.933
Calm. Be calm, Wild Demir.

0:47:07.300 --> 0:47:09.400
There is no lie in my words.

0:47:09.733 --> 0:47:11.333
God is my witness.

0:47:12.433 --> 0:47:17.366
Ertugrul kidnapped Suleyman Shah’s
guests last night.

0:47:18.000 --> 0:47:22.900
Their fate is unknown. In order to learn
what happened to our Bey’s guests...

0:47:23.366 --> 0:47:25.666
...I sent some of my Alps after them.

0:47:27.600 --> 0:47:31.566
In the morning,
news of their death reached me.

0:47:40.766 --> 0:47:45.400
You are so anxious to stir up trouble
inside the tribe, Kurdoglu.

0:47:46.533 --> 0:47:49.700
Aren’t you ashamed to take advantage
of my father’s illness?

0:47:49.966 --> 0:47:53.366
Gundogdu do not talk like you don’t know.

0:47:54.300 --> 0:47:56.600
You set this up with your brother.

0:47:57.433 --> 0:48:02.300
You disobeyed the order and gave the
agreement given to you, to Ertugrul.

0:48:02.800 --> 0:48:07.633
One of us has to stay in the tribe
and fight against Kurdoglu’s doings.

0:48:07.900 --> 0:48:09.266
Kurdoglu?

0:48:09.366 --> 0:48:13.233
He learned that Numan and his son are
Shahzades. Now he is trying to convince...

0:48:13.366 --> 0:48:17.433
...the Beys in the headquarters to migrate
somewhere in Seljuk territory, not Aleppo.

0:48:18.433 --> 0:48:21.900
You are the one who is trying to take
advantage of your father’s illness.

0:48:22.200 --> 0:48:25.733
You are the one who sits in his place,
while he is laying in his bed.

0:48:26.200 --> 0:48:31.000
Thank God that my blood brother’s eyes
are closed and he doesn’t see these days.

0:48:39.233 --> 0:48:40.766
Let us go, Beys of Kayi.

0:48:50.533 --> 0:48:53.333
A headquarters not called by
Suleyman Shah...

0:48:53.966 --> 0:48:56.266
...is not a place we want to be in.

0:49:10.200 --> 0:49:11.900
What will happen now, Bey?

0:49:13.500 --> 0:49:17.366
The order given by Suleyman Shah
is still valid.

0:49:19.566 --> 0:49:22.600
Preparations for migration
to Aleppo shall continue.

0:49:23.333 --> 0:49:28.000
We will not give up on our Bey’s words
or his guests. With the help of God.

0:50:01.266 --> 0:50:05.633
We are almost out of the Seljuk territory,
we can rest our horses here for a while.

0:50:41.200 --> 0:50:43.733
-How is he, mother?
-The same, my son.

0:50:53.400 --> 0:50:55.266
Did you hear our voices?

0:50:59.566 --> 0:51:03.666
I am going to say that we should
send your father as soon as possible.

0:51:04.666 --> 0:51:08.500
You are right, mother. We should have him
reach our destination...

0:51:08.633 --> 0:51:11.500
...before he gets really distraught
during the migration.

0:51:11.700 --> 0:51:16.266
You are right, Gundogdu Bey.
I can check and fix the old cart...

0:51:17.000 --> 0:51:20.366
...for a more comfortable journey
for Suleyman Shah.

0:51:21.399 --> 0:51:22.633
Thank you, Usta.

0:51:23.966 --> 0:51:28.266
If he goes to Aleppo sooner,
we might find a remedy as well.

0:51:30.800 --> 0:51:35.633
But I cannot come with you. You know that
the tribe is like a witch’s cauldron.

0:51:37.333 --> 0:51:42.800
Don’t worry, Gundogdu Bey. I can take
Mother Hayme and Suleyman Shah...

0:51:43.000 --> 0:51:47.666
...to Aleppo safe and sound.
We will leave early in the morning.

0:51:47.966 --> 0:51:49.433
If God permits.

0:52:02.766 --> 0:52:04.300
Look at Ertugrul.

0:52:04.500 --> 0:52:08.433
I would have never thought that
he would kill the tribe’s warriors.

0:52:12.233 --> 0:52:15.833
You have been my assistant for nothing
all these years, Alpargu.

0:52:30.933 --> 0:52:32.333
Bey...

0:52:33.266 --> 0:52:34.900
...this is a Crusader arrow.

0:52:35.333 --> 0:52:38.833
Bravo, Alpargu.
You start to understand slowly.

0:53:37.733 --> 0:53:40.266
-Turgut Agabey?
-Yes, brave boy?

0:53:40.433 --> 0:53:43.233
How are you related to
Bamsi and Dogan Agabeys?

0:53:44.466 --> 0:53:46.333
They are my blood brothers.

0:53:46.733 --> 0:53:48.933
I have a blood brother as well now.

0:53:50.000 --> 0:53:51.800
Who is your blood brother?

0:53:52.466 --> 0:53:53.633
Dundar.

0:53:55.433 --> 0:53:58.233
But you blood brothers
are always together...

0:53:58.500 --> 0:54:00.466
...Dundar and I are separated.

0:54:02.866 --> 0:54:05.266
The world is not so large, my friend.

0:54:06.833 --> 0:54:08.766
Mountains may not meet...

0:54:09.600 --> 0:54:11.500
...but people can meet again.

0:54:29.200 --> 0:54:32.900
The hillside is quiet. There is no one
in sight. How was your side?

0:54:33.433 --> 0:54:36.000
The downside is clear as well.
This is a secure place.

0:54:37.700 --> 0:54:42.466
Everywhere is clear, why are you frowning.
Because you couldn’t find an enemy?

0:54:44.566 --> 0:54:47.466
No, this man called Afsin
is making me anxious.

0:54:47.766 --> 0:54:49.566
Do you know who he is?

0:54:49.900 --> 0:54:52.900
I don’t know either
but it is not very important.

0:54:54.300 --> 0:54:57.000
Don’t tire your pea sized brain out
with things like this.

0:54:57.266 --> 0:54:58.966
Your mind is not used to thinking.

0:54:59.566 --> 0:55:02.833
Look now, we are in the field
beside the water, right?

0:55:03.200 --> 0:55:06.300
Shall we wrestle so that
I can crush you to the ground?

0:55:07.733 --> 0:55:08.833
Alright. Alright but...

0:55:09.233 --> 0:55:11.500
...do not cry when you lose!

0:55:13.400 --> 0:55:15.633
Let me go! I said let me go!

0:55:19.966 --> 0:55:21.566
Let me go!

0:55:30.366 --> 0:55:32.433
What about you and Aykiz Abla?

0:55:36.333 --> 0:55:37.766
She is my sweetheart.

0:55:37.900 --> 0:55:40.733
Are Ertugrul Agabey and
my sister Halime sweethearts too?

0:55:40.833 --> 0:55:42.233
Yigit Alp?

0:55:47.266 --> 0:55:48.766
What are you saying?

0:55:50.700 --> 0:55:53.333
-Get the dried meat from the saddlebag.
-But, sister.

0:55:53.400 --> 0:55:54.500
Go on.

0:55:55.933 --> 0:55:57.466
-But sister...
-Go on.

0:56:23.633 --> 0:56:26.266
I will send Ertugrul to you, my brother.

0:56:28.400 --> 0:56:30.600
Your soul will not be tormented anymore.

0:57:06.366 --> 0:57:07.733
Are you fine, Shahzade?

0:57:09.600 --> 0:57:10.800
Yes, thank you.

0:57:12.333 --> 0:57:14.200
I am listening to my inner voice.

0:57:16.200 --> 0:57:18.300
What does your inner voice say to you?

0:57:19.900 --> 0:57:24.466
I think about my forefather Oguz.
He saw a dream, our Oguz Khan...

0:57:26.200 --> 0:57:32.233
...and he pulled his golden bow
from sunrise to sunset...

0:57:32.866 --> 0:57:38.600
...and said
this world is too small for two rulers...

0:57:39.633 --> 0:57:41.466
...enough for one ruler.

0:57:42.300 --> 0:57:44.333
And our Great Bilge Khan said...

0:57:45.733 --> 0:57:48.433
...as long as the blue sky
does not fall down...

0:57:48.533 --> 0:57:51.566
...or as long as the great earth
does not split apart...

0:57:51.766 --> 0:57:54.500
...no one can overrule your customs.

0:58:01.800 --> 0:58:03.966
Then my grandfather Tugrul Bey...

0:58:04.600 --> 0:58:06.766
...after the Dandanaqan Battle...

0:58:07.700 --> 0:58:09.800
...called for the Great Council...

0:58:11.600 --> 0:58:14.366
...and opened up
new horizons for our people.

0:58:16.533 --> 0:58:19.866
And opened the road to
Rome territory for us.

0:58:20.966 --> 0:58:23.433
And in the Rome territory, in Manzikert...

0:58:23.600 --> 0:58:24.733
...Sultan Alparslan...

0:58:26.766 --> 0:58:29.400
wore his shroud for a new world order
and turned these lands...

0:58:30.266 --> 0:58:31.566
...into a state.

0:58:40.300 --> 0:58:42.700
Do you know what my inner voice says,
Ertugrul?

0:58:43.966 --> 0:58:47.433
We need an another hero who will unite...

0:58:47.600 --> 0:58:52.800
...lead and set a new vision
for these people.

0:00:01.000 --> 0:00:03.000


0:59:14.893 --> 0:59:16.026
Talk!

0:59:17.460 --> 0:59:19.793
Who gave you the order to kill Ertugrul?

0:59:21.893 --> 0:59:23.160
Answer me!

0:59:24.326 --> 0:59:27.826
Who ordered you to kill
Suleyman Shah’s son?

0:59:44.226 --> 0:59:46.260
Has not this lowlife confessed yet?

0:59:47.693 --> 0:59:48.993
He will soon.

0:59:50.693 --> 0:59:52.726
We know that you are not alone.

0:59:53.026 --> 0:59:55.260
Who helped you inside the palace?

0:59:55.860 --> 0:59:57.193
Tell him, uncle...

0:59:57.460 --> 1:00:00.393
...if he talks, I will spare his life.

1:00:02.126 --> 1:00:03.426
Answer me.

1:00:03.826 --> 1:00:08.293
Who helped you to attack Ameer’s guest?

1:00:11.193 --> 1:00:12.660
It was you!

1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:21.226
Answer me properly!

1:00:23.893 --> 1:00:25.193
Who helped you?

1:00:25.393 --> 1:00:27.326
Who? Who was he?

1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:34.893
El Aziz’s vizier,
Sahabettin Tugrul helped me.

1:00:42.426 --> 1:00:43.760
Uncle?

1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:49.826
What is this man saying?

1:00:54.293 --> 1:00:55.893
He will talk soon.

1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:09.026
Someone is coming!

1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:24.793
Get prepared immediately!
Master Titus is waiting for us!

1:02:25.160 --> 1:02:28.860
Exercise is over! Order the knights
in the barracks to get ready!

1:02:33.793 --> 1:02:37.360
My father used to say that you were
his most trusted man. I trust you as well.

1:02:37.460 --> 1:02:39.793
That is your kindness, your highness.

1:02:40.026 --> 1:02:42.093
I trust you more than my uncle.

1:02:42.826 --> 1:02:47.893
Please, your highness Elanora,
do not compare Ustad-i Azam with me.

1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:52.060
Titus talked about a dungeon
before he left the castle.

1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:56.793
Did he want to say that my father was
thrown to a dungeon before he was killed?

1:02:57.260 --> 1:03:01.426
I do not know, it would be best
if you asked this to Master Titus.

1:03:03.893 --> 1:03:07.693
Before my father died, you were always
with him but you did not tell me...

1:03:07.826 --> 1:03:11.460
...about a dungeon. Maybe my father
is still in a dungeon somewhere.

1:03:12.060 --> 1:03:14.260
I am ready to hear and
know the truth, Mario.

1:03:14.393 --> 1:03:17.126
-No, both of you would...
-Both? My father and I?

1:03:17.260 --> 1:03:20.393
No, no. I meant you and Master Titus.

1:03:21.660 --> 1:03:23.460
You are lying to me as well.

1:04:19.093 --> 1:04:21.060
Alright, put it right here.

1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:23.293
Right here.

1:04:29.793 --> 1:04:32.126
If it is ready, untie the ropes.

1:04:42.460 --> 1:04:46.093
Children, take your lamb somewhere else.
We need that chest.

1:04:46.293 --> 1:04:48.893
You help us as well, alright?

1:05:02.726 --> 1:05:07.460
You old goat. I would have never thought
that Ertugrul Bey would dwell in these...

1:05:07.793 --> 1:05:10.093
...love issues like you.

1:05:10.926 --> 1:05:13.326
My brother, these things cannot be known.

1:05:14.126 --> 1:05:16.393
It may happen to you one day as well.

1:05:18.926 --> 1:05:22.660
You would think that you can stand up
against the whole world...

1:05:23.160 --> 1:05:26.793
...but a pair of eyes would come
and smash you to the ground.

1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:31.460
Which girl would like this log?
Moreover you need not a pair of eyes...

1:05:31.826 --> 1:05:35.093
...but a pair of wrists to smash him
to the ground and I have that.

1:05:35.226 --> 1:05:38.026
Stop right there Dogan,
stop clowning about.

1:05:38.693 --> 1:05:40.393
I need to understand this.

1:05:41.393 --> 1:05:43.826
Doesn’t Ertugrul Bey love this girl now?

1:05:46.326 --> 1:05:49.093
He should ask permission
from her father to get married.

1:05:53.393 --> 1:05:55.426
Are these things so easy, brother?

1:05:56.326 --> 1:06:00.426
I don’t understand. If Ertugrul Bey asks
for her hand, wouldn’t her father accept?

1:06:05.693 --> 1:06:10.126
If that is not possible,
we can abduct Halime Sultan.

1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:17.360
What does your heart say?

1:06:18.893 --> 1:06:22.726
State your troubles so that
we can help you if we know a way.

1:06:28.660 --> 1:06:33.726
My Sultan, he wants to escape from the
hell we call palace as soon as possible.

1:06:35.393 --> 1:06:39.726
So that he can focus on praying to God
in the Prophet’s mosques.

1:06:48.026 --> 1:06:52.226
Is your desire, leaving behind
the throne like Shah Ibrahim ibn Adham...

1:06:52.460 --> 1:06:54.460
...and to reach enlightenment?

1:06:56.293 --> 1:06:59.660
But would not leaving this post
and going away mean...

1:06:59.826 --> 1:07:03.393
...leaving behind the ones
who trust you as well?

1:07:05.060 --> 1:07:08.026
You give your services in the palace.

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:12.126
But what will happen to the Muslim world?

1:07:12.993 --> 1:07:16.160
The owner of this world and Islam is God.

1:07:17.193 --> 1:07:21.060
Your duty is to work on the path to God.

1:07:23.026 --> 1:07:25.326
I have never refrained from duty.

1:07:25.660 --> 1:07:28.993
I did all that was asked from me
without hesitation.

1:07:30.860 --> 1:07:34.260
-But...
-What is the despair in your mind?

1:07:36.726 --> 1:07:39.126
Ameer  El Aziz, my nephew.

1:07:40.393 --> 1:07:42.293
He is just like a child.

1:07:42.793 --> 1:07:46.426
I consume all my energy
trying to contain him.

1:07:48.260 --> 1:07:49.726
But...

1:07:50.126 --> 1:07:52.660
...messengers bring news every day.

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:57.693
From Abbasi Khalifa’s palace,
Khwarazmshah’s throne...

1:07:58.126 --> 1:08:00.093
...from Cairo, Baghdad.

1:08:00.660 --> 1:08:05.193
Wherever there is a vizier, a mayor who
cares for the problems of the people...

1:08:05.360 --> 1:08:07.960
...they are being killed one by one.

1:08:08.860 --> 1:08:13.826
Even in our own palace, we do not know
who is acting according to whose agenda.

1:08:16.660 --> 1:08:18.426
Are the things you said...

1:08:18.993 --> 1:08:22.726
...an excuse to resign from your duty...

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:26.160
...or a reason to work even harder?

1:08:28.693 --> 1:08:32.160
When you continue in your efforts
without questioning yourself...

1:08:32.326 --> 1:08:38.193
...God will bring you assistants and the
people whom you will help sooner or later.

1:08:39.993 --> 1:08:41.360
My sheikh...

1:08:42.060 --> 1:08:44.860
...could you do a favor
for this God’s subject?

1:08:45.193 --> 1:08:46.793
Favor?

1:08:47.426 --> 1:08:50.726
When a man asks for
a favor from his father...

1:08:50.860 --> 1:08:53.860
...the father would say
“give service, my son.”

1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:56.026
Do not forget...

1:08:56.293 --> 1:09:00.060
...those who are ready to sacrifice
themselves for their invalid beliefs...

1:09:00.260 --> 1:09:04.693
...would always win over the Muslims
who are not prepared to fight for God.

1:09:04.826 --> 1:09:06.393
This is God’s justice.

1:09:59.760 --> 1:10:02.926
God’s Son is waiting for you
at His kingdom in heaven.

1:10:03.260 --> 1:10:06.893
You suffered, just like
He suffered in order to save us.

1:10:09.026 --> 1:10:10.260
What is inside it?

1:10:10.460 --> 1:10:13.760
Argos. It will take you to God’s Son.

1:10:16.126 --> 1:10:20.093
When you see me again,
it means you are on your way to God.

1:10:56.193 --> 1:10:58.393
What is the latest situation
in the palace?

1:10:58.726 --> 1:11:01.893
We have someone from us
in almost all the posts.

1:11:02.126 --> 1:11:03.460
What about the vizier?

1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:09.460
Sahabettin.
His eyes are always on his nephew. But...

1:11:10.893 --> 1:11:13.026
...I have some plans for him as well.

1:11:13.426 --> 1:11:14.893
Good.

1:11:15.460 --> 1:11:21.160
Soon, death will fall upon
all Muslim capitals.

1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:25.326
Everyone will ask for help
from their neighbors.

1:11:26.660 --> 1:11:30.426
It is of utmost importance that the
replies to letters that come to Aleppo...

1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:35.760
...are stamped with El Aziz’s seal
but written by you.

1:11:36.693 --> 1:11:39.926
Before calling for the Crusade army...

1:11:40.193 --> 1:11:44.960
...we should take hold of all
communications within the Muslim palaces.

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:49.160
I understand, sir. Do now worry.
If you don’t have any other orders...

1:11:49.326 --> 1:11:52.793
...I would like to return to the palace.
I would not like them to miss me.

1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:55.226
What did you do about the issue of Kayis?

1:11:55.693 --> 1:12:01.160
Will you be able to send Suleyman Shah’s
tribe to another place away from us?

1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:07.393
When I deal with Vizier Sahabettin,
that issue will be solved as well, sir.

1:12:09.193 --> 1:12:12.060
Titus also said things similar to this.

1:12:12.893 --> 1:12:17.093
He said Kayis will never
settle under our noses...

1:12:18.093 --> 1:12:20.960
...but they will be starting
their journey soon.

1:12:21.293 --> 1:12:26.160
Sir, why does the existence of Kayis
at your borders makes you worry so much?

1:12:27.426 --> 1:12:33.193
Why are you so anxious about a tribe that
can only gather 2000 warriors at most?

1:12:33.993 --> 1:12:39.726
When I clear the road between Antioch and
Jerusalem for a new Crusade campaign...

1:12:40.226 --> 1:12:46.893
...the last thing I want is
a warring Turkmen tribe settled nearby.

1:12:49.993 --> 1:12:54.893
If we close our eyes on Kayis today,
tomorrow they would close our eyes.

1:12:57.326 --> 1:12:59.693
Do not forget Saladin Ayyubi.

1:13:00.660 --> 1:13:04.460
He was born in one of
the thousands of farms within Iraq.

1:13:05.226 --> 1:13:09.726
Then he became a soldier under
the command of Nureddin Zengid.

1:13:10.326 --> 1:13:11.893
He was promoted.

1:13:12.326 --> 1:13:15.926
He was only a commander amongst
hundreds of commanders.

1:13:16.393 --> 1:13:18.093
You know the rest.

1:13:18.426 --> 1:13:21.026
If we could stop him in time...

1:13:21.293 --> 1:13:25.160
...Jerusalem would still be
in our hands now.

1:13:26.793 --> 1:13:30.660
And I would not have needed to bother
with people like you!

1:13:32.293 --> 1:13:33.826
I understand, sir.

1:13:38.926 --> 1:13:43.026
Tell them to prepare the horses, Marcus.
We are going back to the castle.

1:13:45.026 --> 1:13:49.693
Once upon a time there was
a famous carpenter in Baghdad.

1:13:50.426 --> 1:13:54.860
During his last days,
he carved a very beautiful pulpit.

1:13:56.726 --> 1:14:02.126
A very beautiful one. From walnut wood,
decorated with mother of pearl.

1:14:02.326 --> 1:14:07.326
It was so beautiful that everyone
would be enchanted by its beauty.

1:14:07.860 --> 1:14:12.193
The news of the beautiful pulpit spread.

1:14:12.426 --> 1:14:19.193
Everyone who came to Baghdad would go
and ask him to sell the pulpit to them...

1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:21.926
...to take it to their mosque.

1:14:22.826 --> 1:14:25.260
His answer would always be the same.

1:14:25.460 --> 1:14:29.926
He would say: “No,
this pulpit belongs to Al Aqsa Mosque.”

1:14:30.893 --> 1:14:36.226
People would get bewildered as Jerusalem
was occupied by the Crusaders.

1:14:37.060 --> 1:14:41.160
The carpenter would give
the same reply every single time.

1:14:41.326 --> 1:14:47.426
This is all I can do. I am a craftsman.
I make pulpits.

1:14:48.293 --> 1:14:53.660
Let one valiant warrior take back
Jerusalem, then the pulpit can be placed.

1:14:54.260 --> 1:14:59.460
As time passed, the pulpit story
was heard in all the cities.

1:15:01.060 --> 1:15:06.826
While everyone was telling each other
how beautiful the pulpit was...

1:15:07.193 --> 1:15:11.460
...the story was heard by
a boy only seven or eight years old.

1:15:12.226 --> 1:15:19.193
But he focused more on the will of the man
rather than the beauty of the pulpit.

1:15:20.693 --> 1:15:25.960
40 years passed and he took that pulpit...

1:15:26.826 --> 1:15:30.460
...and placed it in its rightful place
in the Al Aqsa Mosque.

1:15:32.026 --> 1:15:35.926
The tongues spoke of him
as Saladin Ayyubi.

1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:41.893
These matters are like this.

1:15:42.326 --> 1:15:46.660
We carve out new pulpits
like that carpenter...

1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:52.860
...the valiant people who will put them
in their rightful place will come out.

1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:02.326
-Gundogdu.
-Yes, Usta?

1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:07.226
If Suleyman Shah would have seen you
at the headquarters, he would be proud.

1:17:07.726 --> 1:17:10.093
-I just want you to know that.
-Thank you.

1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:18.060
We will break through
this ring of fire together.

1:17:18.226 --> 1:17:20.460
Do not forget, you are his son.

1:17:20.826 --> 1:17:24.693
When your origins are a wolf,
your heart is a wolf as well.

1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:28.093
-Gundogdu Bey?
-What happened, Akcakoca?

1:17:29.460 --> 1:17:32.060
There are some things
I need to talk with you.

1:18:56.360 --> 1:18:57.793
Aykiz...

1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:02.026
...Gokce is not well.

1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:07.926
Her troubles are deep
but she still keeps quiet.

1:19:09.660 --> 1:19:11.726
She refrains from talking to me...

1:19:11.860 --> 1:19:13.426
...can you talk with her?

1:19:13.960 --> 1:19:16.226
I see her condition as well, Mother Hayme.

1:19:16.926 --> 1:19:18.726
But you know as well...

1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:25.060
...the remedy of her troubles
is not with me.

1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:31.393
I know.

1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:33.426
I know but...

1:19:36.126 --> 1:19:38.726
Gokce is like her late mother...

1:19:39.660 --> 1:19:41.460
...she keeps silent and burns within.

1:19:42.193 --> 1:19:44.393
But being so silent is not good.

1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:50.293
Aykiz...

1:20:10.960 --> 1:20:12.160
Gokce?

1:20:18.126 --> 1:20:19.793
Let me help you.

1:20:21.226 --> 1:20:23.760
There are only a few things left anyway.

1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:43.660
You are in sorrow because
they accuse Ertugrul Bey.

1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:48.426
Do not worry, the truth will come out.

1:20:49.160 --> 1:20:50.460
Of course it will.

1:20:58.226 --> 1:21:00.326
We should pray that they are well.

1:21:02.093 --> 1:21:04.660
We could not say goodbye when Turgut left.

1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:10.026
I have a feeling that a bad thing
is going to happen.

1:21:11.926 --> 1:21:13.826
My mind is always with him.

1:21:18.460 --> 1:21:21.726
Hope is the best medicine for even
the deadliest nightmares.

1:21:22.660 --> 1:21:24.160
You know very well...

1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:27.026
...Turgut will return to the tribe.

1:21:27.693 --> 1:21:29.960
His return will be returning to you.

1:21:31.160 --> 1:21:33.660
You will rejoice with your loved one.

1:21:37.093 --> 1:21:40.726
But the separation between
Ertugrul and I is not distance.

1:21:42.026 --> 1:21:43.760
Even if he returns...

1:21:44.893 --> 1:21:48.126
...even if he sits beside me,
I will be the furthest one from him.

1:21:49.860 --> 1:21:53.993
It will be like looking at the sun
behind the insurmountable mountains.

1:22:10.426 --> 1:22:11.826
Bey...

1:22:12.193 --> 1:22:16.060
...first I thought it was because of
the famine and did not gave importance.

1:22:17.060 --> 1:22:19.060
But, the matter is grave.

1:22:20.093 --> 1:22:21.660
What is your opinion?

1:22:23.226 --> 1:22:24.360
Plague.

1:22:29.993 --> 1:22:31.226
Black death?

1:22:32.093 --> 1:22:33.693
What do we need to do?

1:22:34.926 --> 1:22:36.160
Bey...

1:22:36.360 --> 1:22:38.226
...I checked the whole tribe.

1:22:38.460 --> 1:22:43.293
I stamped the ill animals with red paint
and gathered them all here.

1:22:45.193 --> 1:22:48.293
If we exterminate all of them...

1:22:49.026 --> 1:22:52.060
...with God’s help,
we can avoid this disaster.

1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:55.793
If God permits, Akcakoca, if God permits.

1:22:56.260 --> 1:22:57.760
If God permits, Bey.

1:22:58.093 --> 1:23:00.126
Do whatever you need to do.

1:23:00.326 --> 1:23:02.826
Find someone trustable
and keep it a secret.

1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:07.160
The tribe is in the brink of havoc,
we don’t need criers of disaster as well.

1:23:08.460 --> 1:23:11.760
-May God turn it into a good deed.
-Alright, Bey.

1:23:35.360 --> 1:23:39.126
Everyone is nervous as it is,
why do you call me here, Selcan Hatun?

1:23:39.326 --> 1:23:41.760
Why do you worry
when you see me, Kurdoglu?

1:23:41.893 --> 1:23:45.326
You should think about what
you will do when Suleyman Shah wakes up.

1:23:45.793 --> 1:23:49.126
That is not my problem, your husband,
who tries to take advantage of...

1:23:49.293 --> 1:23:51.326
...his father’s illness should be worried.

1:23:51.460 --> 1:23:54.993
You think I am one of the Beys
you convinced at the headquarters.

1:23:55.460 --> 1:23:57.893
Don’t I know the things you are up to?

1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:02.326
Don’t lose your breath and tell me...

1:24:03.660 --> 1:24:06.093
...you beat Gundogdu at the headquarters.

1:24:06.826 --> 1:24:08.860
What will you do when
Suleyman Shah wakes up?

1:24:10.026 --> 1:24:13.193
Don’t you worry about these things,
Selcan Hatun. I will find a way.

1:24:13.293 --> 1:24:15.460
Suleyman Shah will be leaving tomorrow.

1:24:15.760 --> 1:24:18.860
They will be going to Aleppo,
to find a remedy for his illness.

1:24:19.026 --> 1:24:21.026
If he gets up again...

1:24:21.426 --> 1:24:23.393
...think about your fate then.

1:24:26.293 --> 1:24:28.026
What are you trying to say?

1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:31.126
Speak clearly,
do not beat around the bush.

1:24:33.226 --> 1:24:37.426
If our Suleyman Shah who sleeps
with high fever, God forbid...

1:24:38.060 --> 1:24:43.060
...gives his last breath tonight.
Even I would say Azrael was the culprit...

1:24:43.660 --> 1:24:46.393
...I would mourn and cry at his grave.

1:24:51.926 --> 1:24:53.360
How will it be done?

1:24:55.293 --> 1:24:56.360
Tonight...

1:24:56.926 --> 1:24:59.893
...I will take Gundogdu and
Mother Hayme out of the tent...

1:25:00.093 --> 1:25:01.726
...the rest is up to you.

1:25:02.093 --> 1:25:08.860
If Suleyman Shah dies, I would revenge my
father’s death and you would become Bey.

1:26:36.193 --> 1:26:41.193
30 knights have been sent
upon Sir Titus’s request.

1:26:42.660 --> 1:26:46.960
Ustad-i Azam, you have a guest
from Vatican in your room.

1:26:47.893 --> 1:26:49.326
He is waiting for you.

1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:18.793
My dear friend Petruccio.

1:27:19.193 --> 1:27:22.926
Cardinal Thomas.
It is an honor to see you.

1:27:23.326 --> 1:27:25.960
You should have informed us beforehand.

1:27:32.993 --> 1:27:35.793
I did not want to interrupt
your Aleppo escapade.

1:27:36.326 --> 1:27:41.293
You are still being the eyes and
the ears of our Holy Father.

1:27:42.793 --> 1:27:47.760
His highness the Pope appreciates
your efforts but he has some reservations.

1:27:49.026 --> 1:27:52.326
He needs to be convinced for
a new Crusader campaign.

1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:55.393
How can he be convinced?

1:27:55.793 --> 1:28:00.760
You have to take back the holy relics
those infidel Mohammadans stole from us.

1:28:01.660 --> 1:28:05.293
I am guessing you know
who is hiding those holy relics.

1:28:25.693 --> 1:28:28.760
-Hello, my brother.
-Brother?

1:28:30.893 --> 1:28:33.026
Very wrong. Very.

1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:40.193
I remember the day our mother
gave you birth. Shame.

1:28:41.460 --> 1:28:44.260
Brothers should not treat
each other like this.

1:28:44.393 --> 1:28:46.026
Get out of here.

1:28:46.426 --> 1:28:51.460
You did not only shatter your brother.
You shattered your whole family.

1:28:53.126 --> 1:28:54.826
Was it worth it?

1:28:55.893 --> 1:29:01.260
You went after a bedouin.
And destroyed your wife, your children...

1:29:01.426 --> 1:29:05.793
...your cause and everything else
with your own hands.

1:29:07.726 --> 1:29:09.460
But we are brothers.

1:29:13.026 --> 1:29:19.726
If you can bring me the items
in Ibn Arabi’s chest...

1:29:21.326 --> 1:29:24.793
...I can grant you your family.

1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:32.026
Do you still have hope that
I would serve for your goals?

1:29:33.293 --> 1:29:36.393
Don’t ever talk to me about loyalty.

1:29:38.226 --> 1:29:43.393
When you abandoned the Son of God
and sold out the Templars...

1:29:43.960 --> 1:29:47.260
...you proved your loyalty.

1:29:49.093 --> 1:29:52.460
Why should you not do the same again?

1:29:55.893 --> 1:29:57.693
I promise you...

1:29:58.793 --> 1:30:02.293
...if you can bring back the items
in that chest...

1:30:03.960 --> 1:30:06.893
...you can see your family again.

1:30:09.193 --> 1:30:11.760
I know that you don’t trust me anymore.

1:30:13.426 --> 1:30:16.226
For you to trust me once again...

1:30:17.693 --> 1:30:21.893
...I can arrange you to meet
your little daughter at midnight.

1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:24.026
Is my Elanora here?

1:31:01.093 --> 1:31:02.193
Good.

1:31:03.126 --> 1:31:05.293
All the birds are in the same cage.

1:31:41.426 --> 1:31:44.126
-Gokce, you go and sleep now.
-Alright, sister.

1:31:53.926 --> 1:31:55.026
Sister?

1:31:56.660 --> 1:31:58.226
-Hatun?
-Sister?

1:31:58.793 --> 1:32:01.893
Quick, call Mother Hayme. Bring her here!

1:32:03.726 --> 1:32:05.960
Gundogdu, something is happening.

1:32:07.260 --> 1:32:09.660
Gundogdu, something is happening.

1:32:10.693 --> 1:32:14.260
Alright, Hatun. Alright. Calm down.
I will run and bring the midwife.

1:32:15.726 --> 1:32:18.093
Be quick, hurry up!

1:32:33.160 --> 1:32:34.326
Mother Hayme.

1:32:34.993 --> 1:32:36.260
Come, my girl.

1:32:37.326 --> 1:32:39.793
Gokce, what is the hurry? What happened?

1:32:39.926 --> 1:32:43.026
Mother Hayme, my sister is in great pain.
She asked for you.

1:32:48.126 --> 1:32:50.060
I hope it is not a bad thing.

1:32:56.360 --> 1:32:59.226
Akcakoca, midwife Hatun,
do we have permission?

1:33:00.926 --> 1:33:04.293
Yes, Bey? Akcakoca is outside.
I hope there is no bad news.

1:33:04.660 --> 1:33:08.126
No, Selcan has some bad cramps.
We have to go to the tent immediately.

1:33:08.260 --> 1:33:09.993
I will just get my cloak.

1:33:53.393 --> 1:33:56.293
-Is Selcan Hatun pregnant, Bey?
-If God permits, come on.

1:34:03.893 --> 1:34:06.293
-My girl.
-I can’t stand the pain, mother.

1:34:12.393 --> 1:34:15.326
Come on. Keep calm, my girl. Calm down.

1:34:16.926 --> 1:34:18.160
Let me check.

1:34:20.726 --> 1:34:23.060
Calm down, I am just going to check.

1:34:33.293 --> 1:34:35.093
Don’t do it, don’t!

1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:40.426
I hope it is not serious.

1:34:43.893 --> 1:34:45.060
Don’t.

1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:11.226
Is my Bey father alone, mother?

1:36:11.793 --> 1:36:14.426
No. Rahman is with him. Do not worry.

1:36:18.326 --> 1:36:21.960
You go to my father, Gundogdu.
He should not be alone.

1:36:24.226 --> 1:36:25.360
I said go.

1:36:49.793 --> 1:36:51.026
Kurdoglu.

1:36:53.060 --> 1:36:56.260
You have passed the Alp trials.

1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:04.060
You fought with wolves and bears, faced
many dangers to return to your tribe.

1:37:05.460 --> 1:37:10.760
You now have the right to carry
the title of Alp with honor.

1:37:12.060 --> 1:37:16.860
But now the lesson you have to learn
is much more important than all these.

1:37:18.793 --> 1:37:21.860
Being an Alp is not finding food
in times of need...

1:37:22.226 --> 1:37:25.126
...but to stand strong
in the face of difficulties.

1:37:25.393 --> 1:37:27.026
Suleyman Shah...

1:37:28.993 --> 1:37:30.793
...Kurdoglu...

1:37:31.660 --> 1:37:33.260
...Alpsungur...

1:37:34.060 --> 1:37:36.393
...take an arrow from your quivers.

1:37:40.993 --> 1:37:42.126
Break them!

1:37:51.060 --> 1:37:54.193
Take one more arrow from
your quivers and give them to me.

1:38:19.326 --> 1:38:23.026
If you take the advice of
your forefathers and always be united...

1:38:23.193 --> 1:38:25.660
...you would be unbreakable
just like these arrows.

1:38:25.793 --> 1:38:29.926
From now on never let your names
and selves be separated.

1:38:31.460 --> 1:38:34.893
Those who talk about you,
should always refer to your togetherness.

1:38:34.894 --> 0:03:12.474


1:39:33.430 --> 1:39:34.796
Why is it dark in here?

1:39:56.830 --> 1:39:58.096
Rahman!

1:39:59.230 --> 1:40:00.363
Yes, Bey?

1:40:18.596 --> 1:40:20.696
Why are these oil lamps not lit, Rahman?

1:40:23.163 --> 1:40:24.430
I don’t know, Bey.

1:40:52.030 --> 1:40:54.530
You would not be aware
even if doomsday had started.

1:40:56.230 --> 1:40:57.263
Bey?

1:41:02.763 --> 1:41:05.296
-Find something and block that tear.
-Yes, Bey.

1:41:07.563 --> 1:41:09.830
No one will know about what happened here.

1:41:10.196 --> 1:41:12.163
Don’t ever leave my father alone.

1:41:12.730 --> 1:41:14.163
Yes, Bey.

1:41:36.463 --> 1:41:39.696
Thank God. The cramps were a good news.

1:41:40.696 --> 1:41:45.063
Road to motherhood is painful
but the end is a blessing.

1:41:46.030 --> 1:41:48.430
You made us happy in these hard times.

1:41:49.563 --> 1:41:52.796
May God permit us to hold
the child in our arms.

1:41:53.196 --> 1:41:54.496
If God permits, mother.

1:41:54.663 --> 1:41:58.296
If my Bey father recovers soon,
he would be happy too.

1:41:58.530 --> 1:42:03.063
Of course he would. We were yearning
for a grandchild for a long time.

1:42:03.630 --> 1:42:05.463
Of course he would be happy.

1:42:06.596 --> 1:42:08.696
-Sister.
-My Gokce.

1:42:24.396 --> 1:42:25.696
Gundogdu...

1:42:29.163 --> 1:42:30.763
Son, we have good news.

1:42:31.730 --> 1:42:33.730
Our bride Selcan is pregnant.

1:42:34.463 --> 1:42:38.263
He will continue our progeny and
become Bey of the tribe, if God permits.

1:42:38.430 --> 1:42:40.530
If God permits. Thank you, mother.

1:42:46.330 --> 1:42:49.163
-May you be blessed.
-Thank you, Gokce Hatun.

1:42:50.496 --> 1:42:53.030
You should not have left
my Bey father alone.

1:42:54.163 --> 1:42:56.563
He is not alone, Hatun.
Rahman is with him.

1:42:57.030 --> 1:42:59.796
You take care and do not worry
about other things.

1:43:24.063 --> 1:43:25.263
What a bitch.

1:43:26.463 --> 1:43:30.396
First she sent me to the tent.
Then sent her husband after me.

1:43:32.796 --> 1:43:37.696
So she wanted Suleyman Shah dead in order
to take revenge for her father Alpsungur.

1:43:39.296 --> 1:43:42.630
And she was going to make me
a bait for Gundogdu at the same time.

1:43:43.230 --> 1:43:44.763
Two birds with one stone.

1:43:45.596 --> 1:43:47.830
I could not work out the bitch’s game.

1:43:55.696 --> 1:43:59.496
When a wolf gets old,
it becomes the laughingstock of the dogs.

1:44:01.563 --> 1:44:04.430
What do you say, Alpargu?
Are we too old now?

1:44:40.563 --> 1:44:44.663
Their cries tear my heart apart. I wish
we could kill them before setting on fire.

1:44:45.363 --> 1:44:48.330
This illness is not like
the ones you know, son.

1:44:49.630 --> 1:44:54.396
If you touch the meat or blood of these
animals, the whole tribe would be doomed.

1:45:45.596 --> 1:45:50.063
Our Holy Mother,
give me a sign to bring a tinge of hope.

1:45:51.730 --> 1:45:55.196
If my father is alive
and if I can meet him...

1:45:55.796 --> 1:45:57.430
...give me a sign.

1:46:03.663 --> 1:46:05.130
Your highness...

1:46:06.063 --> 1:46:07.396
...are you here?

1:46:09.396 --> 1:46:10.563
Amen.

1:46:11.463 --> 1:46:15.596
You told me that you were prepared
to learn the truth.

1:46:18.230 --> 1:46:19.696
Then come with me.

1:46:44.730 --> 1:46:46.363
-Is it here?
-Yes.

1:46:48.030 --> 1:46:50.130
You never saw me, your highness.

1:46:52.630 --> 1:46:54.530
Is my father behind this door?

1:47:15.496 --> 1:47:17.363
-Father?
-My daughter?

1:47:17.696 --> 1:47:19.430
-Father!
-My girl!

1:47:20.330 --> 1:47:21.463
Father!

1:47:23.196 --> 1:47:24.763
-Father!
-My girl!

1:47:25.230 --> 1:47:27.596
Father,
I thought you were killed years ago.

1:47:27.730 --> 1:47:32.563
I always thought of you.
Hope of seeing you again kept me alive.

1:47:33.230 --> 1:47:35.030
Father, why are you here?

1:47:36.130 --> 1:47:40.196
Your mother, your sister and
you are in my dreams every night.

1:47:41.630 --> 1:47:45.496
-Mother...
-What happened to your mother, my girl?

1:47:47.463 --> 1:47:49.563
We lost her to plague last year.

1:47:54.030 --> 1:47:56.230
Father, why are they holding you here?

1:47:58.730 --> 1:48:01.096
Uncle told us that you were dead.

1:48:03.030 --> 1:48:05.196
Does my uncle know that you are here?

1:48:06.096 --> 1:48:08.596
I will talk with him and
take you out of here.

1:48:09.730 --> 1:48:11.130
My girl!

1:48:14.196 --> 1:48:15.363
Father?

1:48:18.430 --> 1:48:19.596
My girl!

1:48:21.330 --> 1:48:23.063
-Father.
-My daughter.

1:48:23.730 --> 1:48:25.130
My baby!

1:48:28.130 --> 1:48:31.063
My baby! My Elanora!

1:48:34.030 --> 1:48:36.496
My baby, my Elanora!

1:48:40.396 --> 1:48:42.730
Help me God!

1:49:11.396 --> 1:49:13.330
Help me God!

1:50:43.663 --> 1:50:47.063
In short, Ertugrul Bey,
just like the poet says...

1:50:48.330 --> 1:50:52.330
I burned and turned to ash
I became a guide for the sufferers

1:50:53.396 --> 1:50:57.530
I was a Shah and became a subject
With the fire of your love

1:51:07.330 --> 1:51:08.730
With your permission, Bey.

1:51:12.163 --> 1:51:14.096
It is your turn to take watch.

1:51:49.496 --> 1:51:50.730
I could not sleep.

1:51:59.363 --> 1:52:00.530
Halime.

1:52:04.163 --> 1:52:05.396
You know that...

1:52:07.130 --> 1:52:09.063
...I have a thousand problems.

1:52:10.830 --> 1:52:13.163
Their solutions are in my power...

1:52:13.596 --> 1:52:15.630
...and my power is in my belief.

1:52:18.530 --> 1:52:20.630
But there is one problem.

1:52:22.263 --> 1:52:24.696
It is the most beautiful problem...

1:52:25.463 --> 1:52:27.063
...but it burns my heart.

1:52:31.330 --> 1:52:33.430
And its solution is only with you.

1:52:39.563 --> 1:52:44.430
That beautiful eyed gazelle swept away
my feet and made me join its path.

1:52:46.596 --> 1:52:49.230
It took me to you
and threw me to the sea of love.

1:52:50.830 --> 1:52:53.363
I was just about to kill it but...

1:52:54.730 --> 1:52:57.196
...it burned my heart with a fire of love.

1:52:59.363 --> 1:53:01.196
What I am trying to say is...

1:53:04.430 --> 1:53:07.630
...since the first moment I saw you...
-Please, Ertugrul. Stop.

1:53:09.496 --> 1:53:10.763
I shall not.

1:53:13.830 --> 1:53:16.330
I cannot send you away with my own hands.

1:53:18.430 --> 1:53:19.696
Do not go.

1:53:22.796 --> 1:53:24.063
Stay with me.

1:53:26.430 --> 1:53:30.030
Be the sultan of my heart,
the mother of my children...

1:53:31.063 --> 1:53:33.030
...and my companion till the end.

1:53:36.696 --> 1:53:41.163
You are a valiant and honest brave
with a good heart, Ertugrul Bey.

1:53:45.030 --> 1:53:47.530
We owe you not one but a thousand lives.

1:53:53.196 --> 1:53:55.463
But my fate is sealed a long time ago.

1:53:58.796 --> 1:54:02.730
I cannot leave my father and brother
in a world of unknown to go after love.

1:54:06.363 --> 1:54:10.130
When I could not even become
the sultan of the palace I was born in...

1:54:10.330 --> 1:54:12.563
...I cannot be the sultan of your heart.

1:54:15.263 --> 1:54:17.096
This is your tongue talking.

1:54:17.796 --> 1:54:19.530
What about your heart?

1:54:20.830 --> 1:54:22.796
What does your heart say, Halime?

1:54:48.296 --> 1:54:50.563
My heart and my tongue talk the same.

1:54:53.563 --> 1:54:54.630
Don’t go.

1:55:06.363 --> 1:55:07.563
Halime!

1:55:13.396 --> 1:55:14.530
Halime?

1:55:19.696 --> 1:55:20.830
Halime!

1:55:24.830 --> 1:55:26.696
Halime! Halime!

1:55:28.130 --> 1:55:29.263
Halime!

0:00:03.025 --> 0:00:05.025
