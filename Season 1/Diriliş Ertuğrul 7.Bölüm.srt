0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:02.000
episode 7 will start at : 12:10

0:15:20.702 --> 0:15:22.002
Kurdoglu.

0:14:07.200 --> 0:14:09.133
Tell me? Whose dog are you?

0:14:09.533 --> 0:14:11.933
Where is my brother?
Where is the Shahzade?

0:14:12.233 --> 0:14:13.533
Talk!

0:14:16.866 --> 0:14:18.666
It won’t be so easy this time!

0:15:39.390 --> 0:15:43.290
{\an8}ALEPPO

0:16:45.223 --> 0:16:47.556
You have not even blinked an eye
the whole night.

0:16:47.690 --> 0:16:50.623
I have caused great distress
with the news I gave you.

0:16:51.923 --> 0:16:55.523
You are not the source of my troubles,
just the opposite...

0:16:55.690 --> 0:16:58.790
...we learned who the traitor was
thanks to you.

0:17:02.223 --> 0:17:05.623
I worked for our vizier for years,
he is a very good man, he was...

0:17:05.790 --> 0:17:10.290
-...on the right path for years but...
-But the important thing is...

0:17:10.423 --> 0:17:13.756
...not to be on the righteous path but
not to stray for even for a second.

0:17:13.890 --> 0:17:18.990
Alright, Vizier Sahabettin
had served our state well for years...

0:17:19.323 --> 0:17:23.623
...but this does not mean that we shall
turn a blind eye on the things he did.

0:17:30.390 --> 0:17:35.790
Because of the things I shared, I feel
responsible for the fate of your uncle.

0:17:36.523 --> 0:17:41.656
Sahabettin Tugrul’s fate shall be
whatever he deserves.

0:17:42.790 --> 0:17:46.556
I had personally said that
whomever collaborates with the Templars...

0:17:46.723 --> 0:17:50.256
...and becomes a traitor shall be
hanged at the city walls.

0:19:55.379 --> 0:19:56.746
Hamza...

0:19:58.413 --> 0:20:01.480
...are the Alps ready for
the security of the migration route?

0:20:02.280 --> 0:20:03.780
They are ready, Bey.

0:20:07.379 --> 0:20:08.946
Ilyas Fakih...

0:20:09.180 --> 0:20:12.780
...did you talk with the families of
the people who have to stay behind...

0:20:12.913 --> 0:20:15.113
...because of this plague?
-I did, Bey.

0:20:16.146 --> 0:20:18.913
I tried to comfort them but it is hard.

0:20:20.313 --> 0:20:23.280
May God never test anyone
with their children.

0:20:24.480 --> 0:20:27.480
If He does, may He grant them
the patience to overcome the pain.

0:20:27.780 --> 0:20:28.980
Amen.

0:20:30.913 --> 0:20:32.213
Akcakoca...

0:20:32.380 --> 0:20:35.246
...would this plague spread outside
the confinement?

0:20:36.746 --> 0:20:41.313
Bey, these things cannot be known
by looking from the outside...

0:20:42.480 --> 0:20:48.113
...but it seems that this plague
is not spreading outside.

0:20:50.080 --> 0:20:52.146
If you see it fit as well...

0:20:53.146 --> 0:20:56.146
...there is nothing else holding us back
from the journey.

0:20:57.280 --> 0:21:00.313
I see it fit, me may go.

0:21:02.746 --> 0:21:04.046
Then...

0:21:04.280 --> 0:21:08.446
...for our loved ones in the graves
and for our babies in their cots...

0:21:08.913 --> 0:21:12.113
...as an Oguz tribe,
we shall walk to our new homeland.

0:22:35.063 --> 0:22:38.530
The tribe is in enough turmoil as it is,
why do you summon me here?

0:22:40.430 --> 0:22:41.930
I know...

0:22:43.230 --> 0:22:46.230
...Kurdoglu did not manage to kill
Suleyman Shah.

0:22:48.396 --> 0:22:51.563
Do not feel sorrow, Selcan. It is soon.

0:22:52.830 --> 0:22:56.630
You shall revenge the death of
your father Alpsungur.

0:22:58.330 --> 0:23:01.330
Suleyman Shah’s death
will be from your hands.

0:23:04.330 --> 0:23:07.496
But first there is another evil
you need to solve.

0:23:08.830 --> 0:23:11.996
-What evil is that?
-Plague!

0:23:13.396 --> 0:23:16.096
The whole tribe shall be infected soon.

0:23:17.163 --> 0:23:20.263
You have to save yourself
and your son from this evil.

0:23:20.863 --> 0:23:24.496
The ill are isolated. The animals
are burnt! What are you saying?

0:23:25.130 --> 0:23:26.930
It is not over yet.

0:23:27.363 --> 0:23:29.963
This evil shall take many more lives.

0:23:31.563 --> 0:23:33.863
This evil does not have a remedy.

0:23:34.096 --> 0:23:36.330
There is nothing else but confinement.

0:23:37.430 --> 0:23:39.130
I do have a cure.

0:23:43.863 --> 0:23:45.963
You should drink this every day.

0:23:47.896 --> 0:23:52.196
It will protect you, your husband
and most importantly...

0:23:53.030 --> 0:23:55.130
...your son from this evil.

0:18:09.530 --> 0:18:12.230
What happened?
What were you doing here, Kurdoglu?

0:18:12.696 --> 0:18:16.296
I rode my horse without rest
for the safety of our Bey.

0:18:17.063 --> 0:18:18.796
Thank God, I made it in time.

0:18:19.396 --> 0:18:22.196
My blood brother, my life brother.

0:18:22.563 --> 0:18:24.663
Was it an intuition, Kurdoglu?

0:18:25.496 --> 0:18:29.196
How did you know that something
like this might happen to our Bey?

0:18:30.563 --> 0:18:34.763
Mother Hayme, this dog called
Bozok came to me a few days ago...

0:18:35.296 --> 0:18:37.696
...asking me about the
death of his father.

0:18:38.063 --> 0:18:40.763
He heard Gundogdu accusing me
in the headquarters.

0:18:42.296 --> 0:18:44.830
He saw me as the killer of his father.

0:18:45.196 --> 0:18:47.230
He stuck a knife at my throat.

0:18:47.530 --> 0:18:51.763
I still pitied him thinking that he is in
deep sorrow, he was a boy of this tribe...

0:18:52.663 --> 0:18:55.463
...and forgave this impudence.

0:18:57.630 --> 0:19:04.096
But when Gundogdu mentioned that
the Bey’s tent was cut with a knife...

0:19:04.696 --> 0:19:08.563
...God forbid,
implied that he was attacked...

0:19:13.030 --> 0:19:16.663
...I thought about how some people might
have whispered something in his ear.

0:19:16.830 --> 0:19:21.696
Then I could not stay back, so I got on
my horse and rode until it was exhausted.

0:19:22.763 --> 0:19:25.163
What happened to my tribe in two days?

0:19:25.730 --> 0:19:31.396
Traitors have embarked, Alps have
separated and everything has fallen apart.

0:21:19.900 --> 0:21:22.333
Thank you, despite everything, Kurdoglu.

0:21:23.166 --> 0:21:24.566
What if you were late?

0:21:28.166 --> 0:21:32.633
God has spared our Bey’s life to us ,
Wild Demir. The rest is not important.

0:21:39.300 --> 0:21:40.533
Well?

0:21:40.733 --> 0:21:43.633
What will you do now?
Will you come with us to Aleppo?

0:21:43.766 --> 0:21:48.433
No, I have to return. I cannot leave
the tribe alone in a migration journey.

0:21:50.500 --> 0:21:53.866
You are with our Shah, Wild Demir.
I know he is in good hands.

0:21:54.533 --> 0:21:55.800
Thank you.

0:21:58.133 --> 0:21:59.433
See you in Aleppo.

0:25:33.793 --> 0:25:35.426
This is Turgut’s axe!

0:25:45.693 --> 0:25:47.660
And this is Shahzade’s necklace.

0:25:52.660 --> 0:25:54.560
What are they doing here, Bey?

0:25:57.260 --> 0:25:58.393
Sit down.

0:26:00.826 --> 0:26:02.560
I will tell you everything.

0:26:12.393 --> 0:26:16.326
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS TEMPLARS CASTLE

0:26:21.260 --> 0:26:22.360
Yigit...

0:26:24.326 --> 0:26:25.793
...do not let yourself down.

0:26:26.326 --> 0:26:28.826
Patience is bitter but its fruit is sweet.

0:26:29.793 --> 0:26:31.060
Alright, my lion?

0:26:32.360 --> 0:26:35.926
I am fine, Turgut Aga.
I am only a bit tired.

0:26:36.626 --> 0:26:37.960
Well done, my boy.

0:26:53.760 --> 0:26:56.560
Why did you chain the Shahzade?
Untie him quick.

0:27:05.593 --> 0:27:07.826
My Shahzade, your cap.

0:27:18.060 --> 0:27:19.493
Have some water.

0:27:25.260 --> 0:27:28.893
These crass savages have been tactless.
Having a Shahzade like you...

0:27:29.660 --> 0:27:33.526
...breath the same air
with a shepherd is shameful.

0:27:35.826 --> 0:27:38.326
Would you like me to wash your face,
Shahzade?

0:27:55.026 --> 0:27:58.026
I am Cardinal Thomas.
I come from the Papacy.

0:27:59.293 --> 0:28:01.693
I am always ready to assist you.

0:28:02.826 --> 0:28:07.060
I could not sleep all night because of
how these miserable people treated you.

0:28:07.826 --> 0:28:10.026
I have arranged a special room for you.

0:28:10.360 --> 0:28:13.860
I would like to serve the best I can
to host you in a manner deserving of...

0:28:13.993 --> 0:28:15.926
...the royal blood you carry.

0:28:18.726 --> 0:28:20.360
What about Turgut Aga?

0:28:23.460 --> 0:28:26.893
Do not worry about him.
They will take good care of him.

0:28:29.760 --> 0:28:31.860
Shall we go, Shahzade? Please.

0:28:44.426 --> 0:28:45.560
But...

0:28:45.726 --> 0:28:47.826
...we have another big trouble
awaiting us.

0:28:47.960 --> 0:28:51.726
It is obvious that the things I told
Sahabettin has not been heard by El Aziz.

0:28:52.260 --> 0:28:55.593
Today El Aziz,
tore off the agreement saying that...

0:28:57.060 --> 0:28:58.993
...there is plague in our tribe.

0:29:01.060 --> 0:29:04.493
This means that the caravans
don’t have a home to migrate to.

0:29:04.726 --> 0:29:08.626
Aleppo! Aleppo! May the ground split
and take you in, Aleppo!

0:29:08.760 --> 0:29:10.893
This is not the time to cry and frown.

0:29:11.026 --> 0:29:14.993
I understand that Sahabettin fell victim
to a plot of the Templars.

0:29:15.360 --> 0:29:19.060
Otherwise he would not have left me
alone in that palace no matter what.

0:29:19.393 --> 0:29:22.626
What do you propose, Ertugrul Bey?
What is on your mind?

0:29:23.260 --> 0:29:25.626
We have to learn
what happened to Sahabettin.

0:29:26.293 --> 0:29:29.693
The vizier is the only person
who can help us reach Yigit and Turgut...

0:29:29.826 --> 0:29:32.393
...as well as solve
this issue of our homeland.

0:29:32.526 --> 0:29:35.526
We cannot leave him to the mercy of
the Crusader infidels.

0:29:51.360 --> 0:29:52.560
Where are we going?

0:29:53.793 --> 0:29:58.626
We are going to watch a ceremony where
youngsters like you turn to real heroes.

0:30:24.393 --> 0:30:25.493
Father...

0:30:25.826 --> 0:30:26.960
...Son...

0:30:27.260 --> 0:30:28.726
...and The Holy Ghost.

0:31:02.560 --> 0:31:03.626
Father...

0:31:04.560 --> 0:31:05.793
...Son...

0:31:06.326 --> 0:31:07.593
...and The Holy Ghost.

0:31:17.660 --> 0:31:19.726
Have they become Alps now?

0:31:20.526 --> 0:31:25.293
They have become invincible warriors,
more powerful and braver than the Alps.

0:32:02.993 --> 0:32:04.426
My governess...

0:32:04.960 --> 0:32:07.060
...I am really worried about my uncle.

0:32:14.393 --> 0:32:16.393
Can he be in some sort of trouble?

0:32:31.993 --> 0:32:34.493
You are not hiding anything
from me, are you?

0:32:35.060 --> 0:32:38.560
My beautiful girl,
when did I ever hide anything from you?

0:32:39.393 --> 0:32:41.693
Do not worry. I sent the maids.

0:32:42.026 --> 0:32:45.493
We will get good news from
our vizier soon, if God permits.

0:32:45.826 --> 0:32:47.593
If God permits, governess.

0:32:50.260 --> 0:32:54.260
Look, whatever the news,
you shall tell me the truth. Promise me.

0:32:54.393 --> 0:32:56.926
Leila, do not worry.
I told you that I would.

0:32:57.793 --> 0:32:59.393
Promise me, governess.

0:32:59.560 --> 0:33:03.693
God give me patience. Alright. I promise.

0:33:10.326 --> 0:33:11.893
Do not be sad, Esma.

0:33:13.393 --> 0:33:16.026
We set out a trap but could not succeed.

0:33:18.293 --> 0:33:23.793
I did not realize that the infidels were
within us and they held my nephew...

0:33:24.626 --> 0:33:26.026
...in their hands.

0:33:27.993 --> 0:33:29.960
Who do you suspect, Efendi?

0:33:30.660 --> 0:33:32.793
I did not consider him at first but...

0:33:32.926 --> 0:33:34.293
...Nasir.

0:33:34.726 --> 0:33:37.260
Do not be scared. Do not be afraid.

0:33:38.326 --> 0:33:42.893
My brave Esma. There is no one
I can trust in the palace apart from you.

0:33:45.926 --> 0:33:47.993
What can I do for you, Efendi?

0:33:48.393 --> 0:33:49.526
Just order.

0:33:50.626 --> 0:33:53.560
You need to find someone
and bring him here for me.

0:33:54.626 --> 0:33:56.026
His name is Ertugrul.

0:34:30.426 --> 0:34:31.526
My uncle.

0:34:33.326 --> 0:34:34.826
Did she bring the news?

0:34:40.393 --> 0:34:42.493
Calm down, Leila. You will get ill.

0:34:42.993 --> 0:34:45.726
I am calm, governess. You promised me.

0:34:46.660 --> 0:34:48.460
You shall tell me straight up.

0:34:48.560 --> 0:34:49.726
Is my uncle well?

0:34:52.293 --> 0:34:54.760
Vizier Sahabettin has been arrested.

0:34:57.926 --> 0:34:59.460
He is to be tried.

0:35:01.660 --> 0:35:03.326
Who did this and why?

0:35:04.726 --> 0:35:06.360
Leila, calm down.

0:35:09.493 --> 0:35:10.626
Your brother.

0:35:12.293 --> 0:35:15.993
Your uncle was arrested on
the orders of your brother Ameer El Aziz.

0:35:26.460 --> 0:35:28.260
Leila, Leila.

0:35:29.360 --> 0:35:31.926
You need to be calm. Come and sit here.

0:35:32.693 --> 0:35:33.993
Come on, my girl.

0:35:34.960 --> 0:35:37.560
Calm down. You need to be calm.

0:35:38.426 --> 0:35:41.826
Brother. I have to see my brother.

0:35:42.493 --> 0:35:44.526
Governess, I have to save my uncle.

0:35:49.660 --> 0:35:51.493
Do I understand you correctly?

0:35:51.993 --> 0:35:54.693
This man called you smooth faced...

0:35:56.493 --> 0:35:57.726
...and you got angry.

0:35:59.826 --> 0:36:01.293
Yes, your highness.

0:36:03.260 --> 0:36:06.726
But you cannot grow a beard.
Why do you get angry?

0:36:10.660 --> 0:36:12.326
Anyway, you tell me.

0:36:13.293 --> 0:36:17.960
-Your highness, this smooth face came...
-That is not appropriate.

0:36:19.960 --> 0:36:24.893
In my presence, in the presence of
Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz...

0:36:25.026 --> 0:36:28.493
...you shall both watch your manners.
Now talk.

0:36:29.960 --> 0:36:33.493
Efendi, this man came and...

0:36:34.293 --> 0:36:36.860
...plucked my beard, Efendi.

0:36:38.993 --> 0:36:40.426
Is that all?

0:36:52.493 --> 0:36:54.626
-Nasir.
-Yes, your highness?

0:36:55.493 --> 0:36:57.560
Throw both of them to the dungeon.

0:36:59.326 --> 0:37:03.293
They shall stay in the dungeon
until the smooth face grows a beard.

0:37:04.260 --> 0:37:08.060
When the smooth face grows a beard,
the man whose beard was plucked...

0:37:08.460 --> 0:37:12.893
...shall pluck the beard of smooth face
to exercise the right to eye for an eye.

0:37:14.626 --> 0:37:16.760
And this problem shall be solved.

0:37:21.693 --> 0:37:24.660
-Let me go, your highness!
-Let me go! I beg you, let me go!

0:37:24.793 --> 0:37:27.326
-Please spare us.
-Let me go! Let me go!

0:37:29.060 --> 0:37:31.493
Nasir? Are these real?

0:37:32.026 --> 0:37:34.960
Or did you arrange
this visit day to entertain me?

0:37:36.260 --> 0:37:39.360
Please know that I have no contribution
at all, your highness.

0:37:39.560 --> 0:37:42.460
Your subjects came to take refuge
in your justice.

0:37:43.426 --> 0:37:44.726
My dear Nasir...

0:37:44.893 --> 0:37:48.060
...why didn’t you tell me that
these state issues are so boring.

0:37:56.893 --> 0:37:58.393
Your highness.

0:38:03.393 --> 0:38:04.726
Leila Sultan.

0:38:05.726 --> 0:38:09.660
I do not understand.
What happened to Leila Sultan?

0:38:10.426 --> 0:38:12.660
She is not well. They wait for you.

0:38:42.393 --> 0:38:44.393
I have just seen Sahabettin.

0:38:45.360 --> 0:38:46.593
He suspects you.

0:39:04.560 --> 0:39:05.793
Peace be upon you.

0:39:07.026 --> 0:39:08.760
My dear Afsin Bey.

0:39:11.993 --> 0:39:16.260
When they said that they saw you in the
streets of Aleppo, I did not believe them.

0:39:16.426 --> 0:39:19.026
So the youngsters realized that
I was following them.

0:39:19.526 --> 0:39:20.993
You raised them well.

0:39:21.560 --> 0:39:25.026
But I am surprised. Is there anyone
left in the youngsters who know me?

0:39:25.393 --> 0:39:26.526
Please.

0:39:28.993 --> 0:39:31.326
Your fame precedes you, Afsin Bey.

0:39:32.026 --> 0:39:34.960
And the ones who don’t know,
we tell what a valiant man you are.

0:39:35.060 --> 0:39:36.260
Do not say that.

0:39:37.360 --> 0:39:40.926
But we talked about you, we tell
the youngsters that you are a martyr.

0:39:41.326 --> 0:39:44.826
But you are as alive as us.
We were just creating a myth.

0:39:46.493 --> 0:39:49.593
Is there any news about
the wise man in Ahlat, Aykutluk.

0:39:50.926 --> 0:39:54.493
It has been a while since
I have to Ahlat and talk with them.

0:39:55.760 --> 0:39:58.260
But the news we received is not nice.

0:39:58.726 --> 0:40:01.760
They say that the path taken
by the Seljuk dynasty is not right.

0:40:01.893 --> 0:40:05.293
Taking Sultan Aladdin from the Konya
palace and burning down the rest...

0:40:05.393 --> 0:40:08.593
...would not be a sin, they say.
I do not know what will happen.

0:40:10.360 --> 0:40:14.760
When a cloud covers the crescent,
they say the night is dark, Aykutluk.

0:40:15.626 --> 0:40:17.660
But everything depends on a wind.

0:40:18.726 --> 0:40:21.860
The crescent shall shine again,
you can be rest assured about that.

0:40:22.026 --> 0:40:24.426
Anyway, I want something else from you.

0:40:24.593 --> 0:40:25.893
Listen closely.

0:40:26.493 --> 0:40:30.393
Inform all your ears and eyes
in the streets of Aleppo.

0:40:31.026 --> 0:40:34.293
We need to learn
the fate of Vizier Sahabettin.

0:40:37.460 --> 0:40:38.626
Thank you.

0:40:43.993 --> 0:40:45.926
Leila? My sister?

0:40:48.660 --> 0:40:50.360
Brother, where is our uncle?

0:40:57.493 --> 0:41:01.993
The starry night of Aleppo, Leila.

0:41:03.460 --> 0:41:05.593
Why do you worry, my dear sister?

0:41:06.026 --> 0:41:08.060
He did not visit me for days.

0:41:08.860 --> 0:41:10.826
He never neglected me before.

0:41:11.660 --> 0:41:13.460
Are the things I heard true?

0:41:17.326 --> 0:41:18.460
My Leila.

0:41:20.526 --> 0:41:22.026
The ache of my heart.

0:41:22.593 --> 0:41:24.660
Why do you make a fuss over my uncle?

0:41:24.760 --> 0:41:28.393
He must be drowned in state work.
He would visit you in a few days.

0:41:28.560 --> 0:41:31.560
Tell me the truth, brother!
Are the things I heard true?

0:41:31.960 --> 0:41:33.560
Is my uncle in prison?

0:41:33.926 --> 0:41:37.893
When a slight breeze passes,
you tremble like a dry leaf.

0:41:38.726 --> 0:41:43.493
Your innocent heart cannot bear
the ugliness of the world.

0:41:43.860 --> 0:41:46.526
You would be bedridden
like a wilting rose.

0:41:47.526 --> 0:41:49.760
My precious sister...

0:41:50.060 --> 0:41:53.826
...do not think about our uncle.
-Brother. Is it true?

0:41:56.560 --> 0:41:58.060
Our uncle Sahabettin...

0:42:00.393 --> 0:42:02.693
...engaged in things not befitting to him.

0:42:03.593 --> 0:42:06.560
Unfortunately,
what you heard is true, my sister.

0:42:07.393 --> 0:42:08.793
I do not believe that.

0:42:09.426 --> 0:42:11.426
How can you believe such a thing?

0:42:11.860 --> 0:42:14.426
Our uncle would never attempt a bad thing.

0:42:25.326 --> 0:42:27.460
You are mistaken, my innocent sister.

0:42:28.326 --> 0:42:30.293
Our precious uncle...

0:42:31.860 --> 0:42:33.426
...our wise vizier...

0:42:34.760 --> 0:42:38.393
...collaborated with the killers
of our father, the Templar Knights.

0:42:49.826 --> 0:42:51.393
Leila, Leila.

0:42:52.893 --> 0:42:54.060
Leila.

0:42:55.326 --> 0:42:56.793
Leila! Leila!

0:45:07.793 --> 0:45:11.360
I told your request to our people,
Afsin Bey. We will hear something soon.

0:45:11.493 --> 0:45:13.926
Shall we drink some sherbet
and rest until then?

0:45:51.360 --> 0:45:52.526
Ertugrul?

0:45:55.593 --> 0:45:56.960
Tell me, my Sultan.

0:45:58.393 --> 0:45:59.926
Do not worry about me.

0:46:00.993 --> 0:46:02.493
I shall be fine.

0:46:04.326 --> 0:46:05.426
I know.

0:46:07.526 --> 0:46:09.926
But I burn inside as I see you in pain.

0:46:12.293 --> 0:46:14.493
You risked your own life to save me.

0:46:16.560 --> 0:46:18.560
What if something happened to you?

0:46:19.360 --> 0:46:22.626
But it did not. I am fine.

0:46:30.693 --> 0:46:32.926
When I opened my heart to you that day...

0:46:34.426 --> 0:46:37.926
...you denied it. You are ready to
sacrifice yourself but...

0:46:38.726 --> 0:46:41.560
...you refrain from
telling me what is in your heart.

0:46:43.993 --> 0:46:47.626
When a girl knows that
she cannot attain her worldly love...

0:46:47.893 --> 0:46:50.560
...she yearns to reach the Godly love.

0:46:55.060 --> 0:46:57.560
Ertugrul you always told me the truth.

0:46:58.793 --> 0:47:01.493
I beg you not to hide
the truth from me now.

0:47:04.560 --> 0:47:07.593
I know it is not a good sign
that they are so delayed.

0:47:09.993 --> 0:47:12.760
Is there any news about Yigit and Turgut,
Ertugrul?

0:47:14.393 --> 0:47:17.026
-Yes.
-Tell me the truth, Ertugrul.

0:47:18.760 --> 0:47:20.760
Did something happen to my brother?

0:47:23.526 --> 0:47:24.926
The Templars...

0:47:26.360 --> 0:47:27.960
...took them as prisoners.

0:47:32.960 --> 0:47:34.260
Don’t.

0:47:35.360 --> 0:47:38.760
Yigit must be devastated. Ertugrul...

0:47:40.426 --> 0:47:42.626
Ertugrul, I beg you, save Yigit.

0:47:43.426 --> 0:47:46.926
I promise you, Halime.
I will bring your brother back to you.

0:47:55.993 --> 0:47:57.360
Hatun.

0:48:29.426 --> 0:48:31.793
You shall be a bit uncomfortable but...

0:48:31.993 --> 0:48:35.660
...when we think about the long time
you shall be spending with us...

0:48:35.826 --> 0:48:39.660
...it is best for everyone
that your paws are under control.

0:48:40.693 --> 0:48:43.760
-Where did you take the boy?
-Don’t you worry about him.

0:48:44.326 --> 0:48:47.660
You can be rest assured that
we will look after him very well.

0:48:47.793 --> 0:48:50.960
He is an innocent boy.
What do you want from him?

0:48:51.360 --> 0:48:53.293
Do whatever you want to do to me!

0:48:53.460 --> 0:48:56.493
Why do you think that we treat him badly?

0:48:57.293 --> 0:49:01.860
Cardinal Thomas who came here
is looking after him personally.

0:49:02.860 --> 0:49:06.626
You should have seen them while
they were watching the knights.

0:49:07.426 --> 0:49:12.926
In the eyes of the small Shahzade,
there was a sparkle that is befitting...

0:49:13.293 --> 0:49:15.693
...of the poor warriors of Jesus.

0:50:02.260 --> 0:50:03.793
Welcome, my princess.

0:50:05.793 --> 0:50:07.360
Where is Elanora?

0:50:07.726 --> 0:50:10.060
Why didn’t my sister come out to greet me?

0:50:10.393 --> 0:50:12.560
Ma’am, Ustad is waiting for you.

0:50:12.826 --> 0:50:15.460
He shall inform you about
this matter as well.

0:50:33.526 --> 0:50:34.793
Isadora!

0:50:38.793 --> 0:50:40.393
My dear niece.

0:50:40.793 --> 0:50:42.360
You are here at last.

0:50:44.893 --> 0:50:46.860
I missed you very much, dear uncle.

0:50:48.460 --> 0:50:51.260
But my sweet sister is still
nowhere to be seen.

0:50:51.960 --> 0:50:53.460
Didn’t she miss me?

0:50:53.993 --> 0:50:57.860
But she was urging me to come as soon as
possible in the letter she wrote to me.

0:51:03.560 --> 0:51:05.293
Where is Elanora, uncle?

0:51:24.960 --> 0:51:27.826
-Governess?
-I am here, Leila.

0:51:29.460 --> 0:51:32.893
Close the curtains, governess.
There is too much light inside.

0:51:37.493 --> 0:51:39.026
My dear girl...

0:51:39.593 --> 0:51:42.726
...if you could get up and walk a bit,
if you could eat something...

0:51:42.860 --> 0:51:44.826
...you would regain your strength.

0:51:45.760 --> 0:51:50.993
You did not eat anything the whole day.
I am really worried about you, Leila.

0:51:53.360 --> 0:51:55.060
Close the curtains, governess.

0:52:18.693 --> 0:52:20.426
Is there any news, Afsin Bey?

0:52:20.893 --> 0:52:22.360
What is his situation?

0:52:23.493 --> 0:52:25.626
The news is not very good, Ertugrul Bey.

0:52:25.960 --> 0:52:29.560
Sahabettin Tugrul is arrested.
He is in Aleppo dungeons.

0:52:36.726 --> 0:52:37.993
What is the reason?

0:52:44.326 --> 0:52:45.726
What is he accused with?

0:52:45.926 --> 0:52:48.593
The accusation is not known, Ertugrul Bey.

0:52:48.760 --> 0:52:53.293
But yesterday Chief of Guard Nasir
and Melik El Aziz were seen...

0:52:53.493 --> 0:52:55.260
...taking something out.

0:52:55.960 --> 0:52:58.993
There was a maid from
the palace with them as well.

0:52:59.660 --> 0:53:02.026
It might be something to do
with the vizier.

0:53:30.426 --> 0:53:32.326
Are you better now, Isadora?

0:53:33.526 --> 0:53:34.993
How did it happen, uncle?

0:53:35.493 --> 0:53:37.693
How did my beautiful sister die?

0:53:38.693 --> 0:53:40.460
You know that...

0:53:40.826 --> 0:53:44.560
...Elanora never accepted
his father’s death.

0:53:46.360 --> 0:53:51.026
And this thought had started
to affect her health.

0:53:52.793 --> 0:53:55.693
Maybe she mentioned this to you
in her letters.

0:53:58.693 --> 0:53:59.826
Mad girl.

0:54:00.693 --> 0:54:04.893
She had a wild idea that
your father was in the dungeon.

0:54:05.760 --> 0:54:11.760
She insisted to go there and started
to create ridiculous excuses to go there.

0:54:12.593 --> 0:54:17.760
And she did not want understand
how dangerous the dungeon was for her.

0:54:19.560 --> 0:54:22.460
I forbade her to go there.

0:54:24.626 --> 0:54:25.726
But...

0:54:26.993 --> 0:54:29.460
...a day when I was not in the castle...

0:54:31.426 --> 0:54:32.993
Did she go down the dungeon?

0:54:34.460 --> 0:54:36.493
One of the ferocious convicts...

0:54:36.793 --> 0:54:39.360
...in the hope of that he might escape...

0:54:40.926 --> 0:54:44.393
...killed our innocent Elanora.

0:54:46.693 --> 0:54:48.893
-Is that convict still alive?
-No.

0:54:50.493 --> 0:54:56.760
He was executed,
just like the guards who let her go in.

0:54:58.360 --> 0:55:02.426
Elanora’s death was avenged
in a suitable manner.

0:55:44.926 --> 0:55:46.626
She is very tame, Efendi.

0:55:46.893 --> 0:55:48.860
But she knows her job well.

0:56:10.260 --> 0:56:12.760
One of the most beautiful girls
we have, Efendi.

0:56:25.626 --> 0:56:28.326
-How is this one?
-She can stay.

0:57:01.893 --> 0:57:04.560
This one is a genuine pearl.

0:57:05.493 --> 0:57:07.893
Words are not enough
to describe her beauty.

0:57:08.393 --> 0:57:12.026
She is intelligent, skillful, educated.

0:57:12.826 --> 0:57:14.860
She has a beautiful voice as well.

0:57:15.026 --> 0:57:19.360
She can sing, recite poems
and dances beautifully.

0:57:20.460 --> 0:57:22.893
Those who watch her dance are enchanted.

0:57:38.593 --> 0:57:40.026
You can arrange the rest.

0:58:35.260 --> 0:58:37.493
You know how this axe is made, right?

0:58:39.426 --> 0:58:40.560
Yes.

0:58:41.360 --> 0:58:42.760
I know well.

0:58:42.993 --> 0:58:48.993
A heap of steel becomes an axe
blow by blow, beaten up endlessly.

0:58:50.993 --> 0:58:52.326
Well...

0:58:52.526 --> 0:58:56.960
...do you know how miners makes the metal
and how leather man makes leather?

0:59:00.560 --> 0:59:04.493
If this piece of leather on you
didn’t get beaten blow by blow...

0:59:04.760 --> 0:59:08.326
...it would have become
a piece of garbage.

0:59:10.760 --> 0:59:16.760
If it wasn’t fired, the metal in your
sword would still be a rock somewhere.

0:59:18.593 --> 0:59:20.360
What about you, Ertugrul?

0:59:21.060 --> 0:59:25.026
What would happen if you were not tested?
Do you know that?

0:59:30.560 --> 0:59:32.893
The problem is not only me being tested.

0:59:33.793 --> 0:59:37.460
My friends,
my battle comrades, my family...

0:59:38.026 --> 0:59:41.560
...my tribe who trusted me.
The vizier who wanted to help me.

0:59:43.460 --> 0:59:46.293
They are all in great difficulties
because of me.

0:59:46.826 --> 0:59:49.460
The pain caused by this
is burning my soul.

0:59:51.426 --> 0:59:53.526
Existence is a school, son.

0:59:54.293 --> 0:59:55.926
Everyone is a student.

0:59:57.326 --> 0:59:59.993
And God is the only Teacher.

1:00:02.793 --> 1:00:06.893
He manifests His Titles and test us.

1:00:07.860 --> 1:00:12.826
But distress or blessing,
mercy or trouble is always from Him.

1:00:13.793 --> 1:00:16.026
Everyone lives their own exam.

1:00:16.593 --> 1:00:21.760
You need to be one of the people who pass
the exam and submit yourself to Him.

1:00:23.560 --> 1:00:28.493
Then you would be the greatest warrior
and the greatest hero.

1:00:29.726 --> 1:00:32.326
Is sitting around like this
a test as well?

1:00:32.493 --> 1:00:35.826
God likes submission, son, not imprudence.

1:00:39.726 --> 1:00:42.360
If a brother is in a bad situation...

1:00:43.626 --> 1:00:50.026
...submission is to look for a way
to get him out, without forgetting God.

1:00:54.026 --> 1:00:57.960
Come on, get up.
Test of a valiant is not easy.

1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:00.693
And a valiant should not stop.

1:01:14.826 --> 1:01:16.026
Her room.

1:01:17.393 --> 1:01:21.260
-If you don’t want to stay here...
-On the contrary, I want to stay here.

1:01:21.626 --> 1:01:26.293
You are very tired.
Rest well tonight, Isadora.

1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:28.793
Good night, my girl.

1:01:30.826 --> 1:01:32.293
Good night.

1:02:10.793 --> 1:02:11.860
Bey...

1:02:12.060 --> 1:02:15.026
...I am the private maid of
Vizier Sahabettin Tugrul.

1:02:15.393 --> 1:02:17.493
My name is Esma, he sent me here.

1:02:17.626 --> 1:02:19.693
How do I know that Sahabettin sent you?

1:02:20.926 --> 1:02:24.826
He told me to say “a man’s word is said
directly to a man’s face” and that...

1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:28.660
...you would know, Bey.
He wants to talk face to face with you.

1:03:02.260 --> 1:03:04.993
All state matters are left to you,
your highness.

1:03:05.326 --> 1:03:08.426
And I thought that you have
a right to enjoy life a bit.

1:03:08.693 --> 1:03:11.426
I hope that I was not tactless.

1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:54.426
How will you take me in?

1:05:55.993 --> 1:05:59.460
There is a secret passage that goes
to the dungeons. My vizier told me.

1:05:59.626 --> 1:06:02.393
We will slip through there
without anyone realizing.

1:05:59.626 --> 1:06:02.260
We will slip through there
without anyone realizing.

1:09:55.960 --> 1:09:59.093
Do not let yourself go, son.
Be strong.

1:10:01.393 --> 1:10:04.460
They will test your will to the limits.

1:10:05.993 --> 1:10:07.926
What more can they do to me?

1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:16.493
I do not care about myself...

1:10:16.893 --> 1:10:19.626
...I wonder what they are doing
to that innocent boy.

1:10:20.526 --> 1:10:22.660
They might have even killed him.

1:10:25.226 --> 1:10:26.560
Look, young man...

1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:29.860
...if your body is in this dungeon...

1:10:30.860 --> 1:10:35.993
...the thing that awaits you
is much more than death itself.

1:10:38.226 --> 1:10:41.026
If you know what will happen
to us so well...

1:10:42.193 --> 1:10:44.460
...you must know those infidels well.

1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:51.960
Because I know them so well,
I am in this dungeon for 17 years.

1:10:54.393 --> 1:10:57.860
How did you bear this for so long?

1:11:00.060 --> 1:11:01.260
With love.

1:11:02.226 --> 1:11:08.160
The one who lights up the darkness
inside you even if your eyes are closed.

1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:14.426
Do not stop thinking for even one second.

1:11:17.393 --> 1:11:20.960
-Are you a hunter.
-I am the hunted this time.

1:11:23.026 --> 1:11:28.526
The new home will be a new and joyous life
for all of us. Especially for us.

1:11:29.460 --> 1:11:32.360
-Does Aleppo have everything?
-It has everything.

1:11:32.926 --> 1:11:35.226
When we reach there, it will be complete.

1:11:35.626 --> 1:11:39.126
We will go and we will wed.

1:11:40.860 --> 1:11:42.660
This is my promise to you.

1:12:37.660 --> 1:12:39.060
Aykiz?

1:12:40.326 --> 1:12:41.493
Let me see?

1:12:43.860 --> 1:12:45.260
It is a deep wound.

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:54.360
Thank you.

1:13:02.626 --> 1:13:04.026
Aykiz...

1:13:05.160 --> 1:13:06.926
...I was presumptuous.

1:13:07.660 --> 1:13:11.093
I broke your heart.
But believe me, it was not my intention.

1:13:13.593 --> 1:13:16.093
When you talked like that
about Ertugrul...

1:13:19.926 --> 1:13:23.860
Aykiz, there is nothing
in my hand except my dreams and hopes.

1:13:25.426 --> 1:13:28.193
The only thing that
make me go forward is hope.

1:13:29.260 --> 1:13:33.360
If I did not have that, I would die right
here, right now from disappointment.

1:13:33.626 --> 1:13:36.960
You cannot sooth your pain
by hurting others, Gokce.

1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:41.426
But do not despair so much.
My problem is not you.

1:13:43.426 --> 1:13:46.326
I thought that as we near Aleppo
I would be relieved...

1:13:46.493 --> 1:13:49.960
...I would be joyous with
seeing Turgut again.

1:13:52.593 --> 1:13:55.093
But a shadow is cast over my heart.

1:13:56.593 --> 1:14:01.293
It is as if I am getting further away from
my sweetheart, instead of nearing him.

1:14:03.626 --> 1:14:06.093
Memories pass in front my eyes.

1:14:09.660 --> 1:14:12.226
Don’t tire yourself out
over nothing, Aykiz.

1:14:12.426 --> 1:14:15.493
Over all the hardships and
sorrows we go through...

1:14:15.860 --> 1:14:18.960
...your love is like a flower
that heralds the spring.

1:14:19.593 --> 1:14:22.126
Ertugrul’s love made you a poet.

1:14:27.193 --> 1:14:29.060
May God bless us all.

1:14:31.226 --> 1:14:34.626
I only want to meet Turgut safe and sound,
that is enough for me.

1:14:38.026 --> 1:14:39.060
Come on.

1:14:52.993 --> 1:14:54.960
I am hungry like the wolf, Hatun.

1:14:55.093 --> 1:14:56.860
Can’t you hurry up a bit?

1:14:57.626 --> 1:14:59.026
I am coming, Bey.

1:15:29.026 --> 1:15:34.160
I made the food you like.
It has been a while since we ate alone.

1:15:35.326 --> 1:15:38.293
-May it be healthy, Gundogdu.
-Thank you, Hatun.

1:15:40.126 --> 1:15:41.493
May it be healthy.

1:15:42.526 --> 1:15:46.426
Hatun, I don’t have time for anything
because of the tribe’s issues.

1:15:46.626 --> 1:15:49.993
You are right, Gundogdu.
You are like Bey of the tribe right now.

1:15:50.126 --> 1:15:52.393
It is not easy to carry this load.

1:15:53.493 --> 1:15:55.426
May God give you strength.

1:15:58.326 --> 1:16:00.860
-Come on, Bismillah. Eat up.
-Bismillah.

1:16:01.860 --> 1:16:03.626
Do we have permission, Gundogdu?

1:16:06.193 --> 1:16:07.393
Gundogdu.

1:16:11.593 --> 1:16:12.960
What do you want?

1:16:13.426 --> 1:16:17.060
Control yourself, Gundogdu.
Don’t do anything you might regret.

1:16:17.226 --> 1:16:20.926
You stay away from this, Selcan Hatun.
There are things you don’t know.

1:16:24.326 --> 1:16:25.526
Yes...

1:16:26.326 --> 1:16:28.926
...these are the things
that happened, Bey.

1:16:29.660 --> 1:16:33.493
But as you have opened your eyes,
nothing is important anymore...

1:16:33.660 --> 1:16:36.160
...they will all pass away,
if God permits.

1:16:36.493 --> 1:16:40.960
Now, even if all hell breaks loose,
we can put it out with our hearts, Bey.

1:16:41.226 --> 1:16:45.893
When we stand together in prayer line,
what trouble can hurt us?

1:16:46.526 --> 1:16:49.126
You have always been with me, Wild Demir.

1:16:50.026 --> 1:16:53.326
Anytime I had a problem,
you were on my side.

1:16:54.460 --> 1:16:56.860
You are closer than a brother for me.

1:16:57.593 --> 1:17:00.160
When you talk about brotherhood, Bey...

1:17:00.393 --> 1:17:03.360
...you, I, Kurdoglu...

1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:12.893
...Alpsungur.

1:17:14.093 --> 1:17:17.260
We were brothers. Yes, we were.

1:17:20.293 --> 1:17:22.593
Look, we are still like that. But...

1:17:24.193 --> 1:17:28.960
Friendship get valuable with age, Bey.
Old friends like you and I.

1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:34.426
Did you see Kurdoglu? He could not hit
a bear in front of him in the old times.

1:17:35.193 --> 1:17:39.993
As he gets older, his eyes started
seeing better than a hawk, God bless.

1:17:58.493 --> 1:18:02.960
This man is someone who I call Emmi
and our Shah calls blood brother.

1:18:03.660 --> 1:18:07.426
But what did he do?
He tried to kill our Shah.

1:18:10.860 --> 1:18:13.293
The matter is not like you think,
Gundogdu.

1:18:13.526 --> 1:18:17.193
-First you have to listen to me.
-What will you tell me? What?

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:22.060
How you panicked when I told you
that you secretly went into the tent?

1:18:22.526 --> 1:18:26.360
Or how you went to finish off the job
in the middle of the night? Which one?

1:18:28.060 --> 1:18:29.660
What are you saying, Gundogdu?

1:18:30.126 --> 1:18:34.860
I went to save Suleyman Shah from
the fury of the rabid son of Baybora.

1:18:36.293 --> 1:18:38.493
I saved our Bey at the last second.

1:18:39.093 --> 1:18:43.093
Moreover it was you who warned me
by telling me the tear in the tent.

1:18:44.526 --> 1:18:47.260
It was Bozok who went
into the Marquee that night.

1:18:47.460 --> 1:18:51.193
I went after him so that he cannot
complete the job he left unfinished.

1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:04.493
And...

1:19:05.026 --> 1:19:07.226
...I just came to congratulate you.

1:19:07.926 --> 1:19:12.093
Mother Hayme told me.
I wanted to congratulate our new nephew.

1:19:13.260 --> 1:19:16.026
The group talked nothing else but this.

1:19:16.993 --> 1:19:19.660
Did Suleyman Shah,
our father heard it as well?

1:19:20.460 --> 1:19:21.560
What did he say?

1:19:21.860 --> 1:19:25.360
He was the most happy one.
Suleyman Shah was overjoyed with...

1:19:25.493 --> 1:19:27.660
...the news of a grandson.

1:19:34.326 --> 1:19:35.526
Anyway...

1:19:35.860 --> 1:19:39.360
...I said what I came to say.
I should not bother you anymore.

1:20:25.160 --> 1:20:27.593
Everything happened as you expected,
Ertugrul Bey.

1:20:28.393 --> 1:20:29.626
Yes, it did.

1:20:30.626 --> 1:20:33.960
They become a hunt while being a hunter,
with God’s permission.

1:20:35.460 --> 1:20:37.993
But the situation is more complex
than we thought.

1:20:38.126 --> 1:20:41.893
If Sahabettin’s most trusted maid
whom he sent for me is a traitor...

1:20:43.060 --> 1:20:45.126
...the vizier is stuck in the trap.

1:20:48.093 --> 1:20:51.660
If a lion is trapped,
even the jackals start to growl.

1:20:54.593 --> 1:20:56.893
We have to save him whatever the cost.

1:21:24.060 --> 1:21:26.426
I will be gone for a while, Ertugrul Bey.

1:21:27.860 --> 1:21:29.893
Is this the right time, Afsin Bey.

1:21:30.593 --> 1:21:32.960
Will you be leaving us alone
in this fight?

1:21:34.293 --> 1:21:38.960
Ertugrul Bey, I know that you wonder
who I am, how far I can reach and...

1:21:39.093 --> 1:21:44.993
...where my roots are. I will answer
all your questions and more in time.

1:21:45.893 --> 1:21:49.426
But now, we have to pass through a bridge
that is thinner than a hair and...

1:21:49.660 --> 1:21:53.960
...sharper than a sword. I ask for
one thing and that is for you to trust me.

1:22:03.593 --> 1:22:08.326
We fought side by side, Afsin Bey. We have
a code of battle friendship between us.

1:22:10.060 --> 1:22:11.426
I believe in you.

1:22:12.993 --> 1:22:17.260
Tomorrow you should go to the Turkmen
carpet man in the market, Ertugrul Bey.

1:22:18.226 --> 1:22:21.626
His name is Aykutluk.
He will help you in every way he can.

1:22:22.893 --> 1:22:27.893
And I will enter through
the gates of hell for Turgut and Yigit.

1:22:28.993 --> 1:22:30.193
Thank you.

1:22:39.660 --> 1:22:43.460
Where did those men come from?
How could you not see them, Eftelya?

1:22:45.326 --> 1:22:47.326
He didn’t have time to inform anyone.

1:22:48.393 --> 1:22:51.193
He must have suspected
beforehand and came prepared.

1:22:51.426 --> 1:22:55.393
But how could you not notice
those two goat herders while walking?

1:22:55.660 --> 1:22:57.926
Do you have an explanation for this?

1:22:58.226 --> 1:23:02.293
I could not see, Commander Titus,
that is why I escaped in the last minute.

1:23:03.260 --> 1:23:06.593
Just like you failing against
Ertugrul every single time...

1:23:06.860 --> 1:23:08.560
...I failed to notice his warriors.

1:23:08.860 --> 1:23:13.026
You should understand me very well in this
manner as you are much more experienced.

1:23:15.060 --> 1:23:16.960
Stop! What are you doing?

1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:21.093
We are all like apostles
fighting for God’s lamb.

1:23:21.260 --> 1:23:25.526
If we don’t trust each other, Jerusalem
can only be a distant dream for us!

1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:29.960
Moreover, when Sahabettin
is killed tomorrow...

1:23:30.526 --> 1:23:35.460
...Ertugrul will only be like a sewer rat
walking around the streets of Aleppo.

1:23:38.060 --> 1:23:43.260
Then, how you take revenge shall be
up to your personal taste.

1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:15.193
You caused all this!

1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:19.026
When will you stop being a stubborn brat?
You don’t care for anyone.

1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:20.926
Not your father, nor your tribe!

1:24:21.060 --> 1:24:23.926
Look at the state of this tribe!
It is cracking up!

1:24:24.126 --> 1:24:27.526
Winter is coming and we don’t even
know where to go! Open your eyes!

1:24:28.126 --> 1:24:29.393
Open your eyes!

1:24:29.860 --> 1:24:33.393
How will this tribe stand strong,
Ertugrul? How?

1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:44.560
You are lying, Ertugrul.

1:24:50.893 --> 1:24:53.660
The eagle is in the cage.
Now it is the wolf’s turn.

1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:01.193
Be the sultan of my heart,
the mother of my children...

1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:03.360
...and my companion till the end.

1:25:03.660 --> 1:25:06.660
When I could not even become
the sultan of the palace I was born in...

1:25:06.926 --> 1:25:08.560
...I cannot be the sultan of your heart.

1:25:18.193 --> 1:25:22.060
<i>Great God, Who has created</i>
 <i>the world and the skies, I turn to you.</i>

1:25:23.026 --> 1:25:25.393
<i>My aim is to set on a new road.</i>

1:25:25.993 --> 1:25:28.893
<i>You are the Owner of</i>
 <i>the road and destination.</i>

1:25:29.060 --> 1:25:31.526
<i>May You bless us at the end of this road.</i>

1:25:31.860 --> 1:25:36.160
<i>My wish is not to be the owner of</i>
 <i>a throne, a crown or property.</i>

1:25:37.226 --> 1:25:40.593
<i>The thing in my heart,</i>
 <i>on this road I set off with Your name...</i>

1:25:40.926 --> 1:25:44.993
<i>...is to glorify Your name.</i>
 <i>My only aim in swinging my sword is to...</i>

1:25:45.193 --> 1:25:50.460
<i>...make my weapon a tool of Your justice.</i>
 <i>If my heart or mind strays from this...</i>

1:25:50.893 --> 1:25:54.493
<i>...lead me to the right path with</i>
 <i>crooked swords, Dear God.</i>

1:25:55.293 --> 1:25:58.426
<i>On this road I set off to glorify</i>
 <i>Your name don’t let my heart...</i>

1:25:58.593 --> 1:26:02.193
<i>...stray to worldly desires. Don’t let</i>
 <i>my mind be deceived by the devil.</i>

1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:06.326
<i>Don’t let me bow down, Dear God. Let me</i>
 <i>and my progeny serve you in Your cause...</i>

1:26:06.426 --> 1:26:08.626
<i>...and be martyrs on this road, Great God.</i>

1:26:24.426 --> 1:26:25.526
Hamza.

1:26:27.226 --> 1:26:28.326
Yes, Bey?

1:26:28.460 --> 1:26:30.460
Take this and load it to the camel.

1:26:36.593 --> 1:26:40.293
Look, Gundogdu.
Little feet will be wearing these.

1:26:40.526 --> 1:26:46.193
With time our son will grow and
be a valiant man, just like his father.

1:26:51.026 --> 1:26:53.993
Your heart and mine is beating
right here now.

1:26:54.126 --> 1:26:57.660
Everything we have, all our hopes,
our happiness is here now.

1:27:00.260 --> 1:27:04.126
He will be our life, our blood,
continuity of our progeny.

1:27:06.393 --> 1:27:09.493
You will see that
all troubles will be left behind.

1:27:10.593 --> 1:27:13.326
The new homeland will be
a new world for us.

1:27:14.226 --> 1:27:16.426
If God permits, Hatun, if God permits.

1:27:16.626 --> 1:27:19.293
Let us complete
this migration journey first.

1:27:20.060 --> 1:27:23.893
Come on, I have some business to
attend to, you should get ready as well.

1:27:58.593 --> 1:27:59.926
Father?

1:28:05.293 --> 1:28:07.026
We ran away for so long...

1:28:08.993 --> 1:28:10.660
...we faced so many troubles...

1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:13.526
...we went through so much...

1:28:13.926 --> 1:28:17.160
But at the end,
we could not protect Yigit.

1:28:19.026 --> 1:28:21.926
There is nothing we can do
except pray, father.

1:28:22.860 --> 1:28:24.560
Look at the state I am in.

1:28:26.226 --> 1:28:27.960
I cannot even get up.

1:28:32.126 --> 1:28:34.960
We will find a way in the end, Halime.

1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:40.360
God will surely open up a blessed path
in front of us in time.

1:28:41.926 --> 1:28:43.560
Ertugrul Bey promised me.

1:28:45.326 --> 1:28:49.560
He will not let Yigit and Turgut Alp
be captive in enemy hands.

1:28:52.460 --> 1:28:54.360
He will not, right, father?

1:28:59.993 --> 1:29:05.660
Your wound is very serious. I beg you,
don’t distress yourself so much.

1:29:28.093 --> 1:29:31.326
There is a Turkmen carpet man
around here with the name of Aykutluk.

1:29:31.426 --> 1:29:32.893
Do you know his place?

1:29:34.260 --> 1:29:37.893
Wake up! Wake up!

1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:41.393
Wake up!

1:29:51.160 --> 1:29:53.493
Be patient, my girl, Leila, be patient.

1:29:53.860 --> 1:29:56.893
Do not throw yourself
into those dark wells once again.

1:29:57.093 --> 1:29:58.560
May God help you.

1:30:15.126 --> 1:30:16.893
-Didn’t she eat?
-No.

1:30:39.160 --> 1:30:41.493
Today will be a difficult day
for all of us.

1:30:41.860 --> 1:30:43.926
We do not know how it will end.

1:30:48.060 --> 1:30:51.993
No news about our vizier
shall reach Leila, do you understand me?

1:30:52.293 --> 1:30:58.526
As you wish. We will of course be careful.
But, how can something like this be?

1:30:59.126 --> 1:31:02.126
How can our great vizier,
Sahabettin Tugrul...

1:31:02.326 --> 1:31:07.393
...whom no one can suspect his honesty
and righteousness be tried?

1:31:08.193 --> 1:31:13.026
You are right. We don’t know with
what kind of a slander he was imprisoned.

1:31:13.660 --> 1:31:19.326
The only thing we can do for him
is to pray God. You may leave.

1:31:41.926 --> 1:31:46.926
God! God! God!

1:31:47.360 --> 1:31:51.626
God! God! God!

1:31:52.126 --> 1:31:56.460
God! God! God!

1:32:20.593 --> 1:32:22.126
Welcome, Ertugrul.

1:32:22.526 --> 1:32:26.393
Our mad ones have been heralding that
you were coming from many streets away.

1:32:28.326 --> 1:32:32.226
Are all those madmen, beggars and
drunkards your comrades?

1:32:33.626 --> 1:32:36.660
When mayors are being bought
and sold in the market...

1:32:36.993 --> 1:32:40.060
...we work with madmen
in this life or death market.

1:32:44.360 --> 1:32:46.860
We need to rescue
the vizier from the dungeon.

1:32:51.193 --> 1:32:54.060
It is very difficult to organize it
before a week, my brave.

1:32:54.226 --> 1:32:58.193
We need to contact the guards in
the dungeon, arrange their schedule.

1:33:56.660 --> 1:33:58.926
Moreover he will be tried today.

1:33:59.926 --> 1:34:03.860
In the Muslim world the balance of justice
is not that crooked yet.

1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:08.026
We should not lose hope from God.
We should wait for the outcome.

1:34:08.193 --> 1:34:09.860
What if it is crooked?

1:34:10.226 --> 1:34:11.893
What will we do then?

1:34:12.126 --> 1:34:15.326
If betrayal damages the justice,
our crooked swords shall put...

1:34:15.493 --> 1:34:17.993
...the strayed ones
on the right path again.

1:34:21.160 --> 1:34:22.660
But, Nasir...

1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:24.260
...this is dangerous.

1:34:24.460 --> 1:34:27.560
Judge Efendi, you were not thinking
of the danger...

1:34:27.893 --> 1:34:30.460
...while you were putting
pouches of gold under your belt.

1:34:30.626 --> 1:34:34.960
You were saying the vizier is as good as
dead. Why do you tremble like a leaf now?

1:34:35.860 --> 1:34:36.993
And...

1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:39.526
...think well, Judge Efendi...

1:34:40.293 --> 1:34:42.993
...after the issue of the
vizier is handled...

1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:46.526
...his highness Melik will need
consultants like you beside him.

1:34:47.360 --> 1:34:49.460
Can you really do this, Nasir?

1:34:51.660 --> 1:34:53.093
Of course.

1:34:53.293 --> 1:34:56.060
You are very important for me,
your judgeship.

1:34:56.226 --> 1:35:00.626
It is not easy to find a man
that can be bought so easily in Aleppo.

1:35:40.993 --> 1:35:43.860
On behalf of Emirate  of Aleppo,
Melik El Aziz.

1:36:16.226 --> 1:36:20.293
In the name of God Who is
The Just, The Avenger...

1:36:20.593 --> 1:36:24.660
...The Prevailer and The Most Gracious...

1:36:25.426 --> 1:36:30.860
...we shall commence the trial of  Emirate
of Aleppo Vizier, Sahabettin Tugrul.

1:36:32.660 --> 1:36:37.493
The accusations are murder,
disobedience of an order...

1:36:38.593 --> 1:36:43.893
...abusing the trust given to him
and betrayal to the City of Aleppo...

1:36:44.093 --> 1:36:46.560
...as well as to the Muslim world.

1:36:56.493 --> 1:36:59.593
I am one of the private guards of
Sahabettin Tugrul...

1:37:01.260 --> 1:37:04.660
...he ordered me to obtain
a fast acting lethal poison.

1:37:06.893 --> 1:37:08.460
I did as I was ordered.

1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:19.526
I saw the people who tried to kill the
Kayi envoy with the vizier in the market.

1:37:20.226 --> 1:37:24.926
The vizier was giving something to them
in a pouch. I am sure that it was gold.

1:37:28.093 --> 1:37:30.926
I am a trader, the vizier forced me...

1:37:31.193 --> 1:37:35.260
...he used me as a decoy in his business
dealings with the Antioch Countship.

1:37:38.393 --> 1:37:42.860
Sahabettin Tugrul, you have heard
the accusations, what do you say?

1:37:47.193 --> 1:37:49.193
I reject all the accusations.

1:37:51.326 --> 1:37:54.559
The accusers
are false witnesses who are bought.

1:38:01.893 --> 1:38:04.393
This is a platform of justice and reality.

1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:09.026
With permission from God, these eyes
can tell between the truth and lies...

1:38:09.226 --> 1:38:12.260
...just like they are black or white.
You do not need to worry.

1:38:12.493 --> 1:38:14.326
Call in the last witness.

1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:29.360
God send you to us, Ummulhayr Abla.
We were going to send a message to you.

1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:32.893
-We have a problem.
-Peace be upon you.

1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:38.526
-And peace be upon you.
-Welcome, Abla. What happened?

1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:41.326
You talked about an important matter.

1:38:43.660 --> 1:38:47.093
I do not know whether you heard about
what happened to our vizier.

1:38:47.293 --> 1:38:50.393
Sahabettin Tugrul is
an honest person inside and outside.

1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:53.626
He is a valuable statesman
Great God has bestowed upon us.

1:38:54.026 --> 1:38:57.526
Everyone knows that he had been doing
his duties in a competent manner.

1:38:58.226 --> 1:39:00.426
He is going through a difficult test...

1:39:00.660 --> 1:39:03.393
...may Great God be on his side.
-Amen.

1:39:04.226 --> 1:39:06.893
Leila has learned about her uncle.

1:39:08.226 --> 1:39:13.493
She is devastated since she learned that
it was her brother who arrested him.

1:39:14.326 --> 1:39:17.960
I worry that she may fall ill once again
and turn her back on life.

1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:22.260
Poor girl, she was recovering
quite well recently, wasn’t she?

1:39:22.526 --> 1:39:26.593
Yes. She had recovered with
the support of our vizier but...

1:39:27.226 --> 1:39:29.026
How can we of help, Abla?

1:39:30.060 --> 1:39:31.260
I...

1:39:31.993 --> 1:39:33.426
...if it is possible...

1:39:33.626 --> 1:39:37.560
...she may be refreshed with
a conversation with our Sheikh Efendi.

1:39:37.993 --> 1:39:42.026
I thought that she should be refreshed
with his light before she turns...

1:39:42.193 --> 1:39:45.093
...herself back to darkness.
-You thought well.

1:39:45.426 --> 1:39:48.360
I shall inform our sheikh
and tell you his decision.

1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:52.393
May God bless you.
I heard that you have a problem as well.

1:39:54.526 --> 1:39:56.860
We have visitors in our lodge.

1:39:57.326 --> 1:39:59.560
They are also going
through difficult tests.

1:39:59.960 --> 1:40:03.960
A young girl like Leila is wounded.
The doctor did all he could but...

1:40:04.126 --> 1:40:07.026
...the wound is getting worse.
The cure is with God.

1:40:07.293 --> 1:40:10.460
If the palace physician checks her,
maybe he can find a remedy.

1:40:10.626 --> 1:40:14.126
Of course, I will immediately
tell him to visit you tomorrow.

1:40:14.293 --> 1:40:16.626
The girl’s condition
is an emergency, Abla.

1:40:51.260 --> 1:40:57.126
Do you swear on the Great Holy Quran
that you shall not be lying in court?

1:41:00.193 --> 1:41:01.493
I do, Efendi.

1:41:02.660 --> 1:41:05.293
Tell everything as you
told me before, my girl...

1:41:05.493 --> 1:41:09.293
...and do not be afraid of anyone.
What happened in that room that day?

1:41:13.360 --> 1:41:17.193
The vizier and I went into
the room the killer was in, Efendi.

1:41:17.660 --> 1:41:20.126
Was there anyone else who knew that room?

1:41:22.293 --> 1:41:24.260
What did you see when you went in?

1:41:32.093 --> 1:41:33.360
The man...

1:41:35.493 --> 1:41:38.026
...was lying down.
He started to tremble.

1:41:38.526 --> 1:41:42.026
Foam started coming out of his mouth,
he was poisoned.

1:41:44.026 --> 1:41:45.460
He died...

1:41:47.126 --> 1:41:49.060
...in the arms of my vizier.

1:41:57.626 --> 1:41:59.293
You may leave, my girl.

1:42:01.426 --> 1:42:03.293
We heard what we need to hear.

1:42:15.093 --> 1:42:16.893
The verdict is decided upon...

1:42:47.326 --> 1:42:49.526
The physician has completed
his examination.

1:42:56.326 --> 1:43:02.560
You were wise to inform us. The wound
is infected, her condition is not well.

1:43:03.493 --> 1:43:06.293
-I did a small surgery.
-May God bless you.

1:43:08.060 --> 1:43:10.026
But we cannot do much here.

1:43:12.126 --> 1:43:16.526
She needs to be looked after in the palace
and treated with special medicine.

1:43:17.026 --> 1:43:21.360
We can take her to the palace. If her
condition requires it, we shall abide.

1:43:24.326 --> 1:43:29.993
Physician, can you tell us what to do
so that we can treat her here?

1:43:30.993 --> 1:43:34.126
I do not want to part with her
while she is in this condition.

1:43:34.293 --> 1:43:37.293
Her situation is critical,
she may not come out of this alive...

1:43:37.426 --> 1:43:41.460
...we did whatever can be done here,
we shall do the same in the palace.

1:43:42.426 --> 1:43:45.460
But only God knows
what the outcome will be.

1:43:46.493 --> 1:43:50.160
You can be rest assured, Efendi.
Your daughter is entrusted in me.

1:43:50.593 --> 1:43:52.960
I will personally tend to her.

1:43:53.260 --> 1:43:57.193
Ummulhayl Hanim is my sister.
She will look after your daughter well...

1:43:57.593 --> 1:44:01.426
...in the palace and she was also
the governess of El Aziz and his sister.

1:44:01.860 --> 1:44:05.560
Sultan Aziz is like her son.
If God permits, there'll be no problem...

1:44:05.860 --> 1:44:07.393
...you can be rest assured.

0:00:11.125 --> 0:00:13.125


0:00:13.150 --> 0:00:15.150


1:45:32.510 --> 1:45:34.510
Thank God, you are better, right?

1:45:35.843 --> 1:45:37.143
Thank God, Hayme.

1:45:38.276 --> 1:45:41.743
We have more meals to eat,
more days to see.

1:45:42.810 --> 1:45:47.676
Yes, if God permits, we shall have
our grandchild in our arms soon.

1:45:49.176 --> 1:45:50.843
It was time anyway.

1:45:51.876 --> 1:45:55.610
This is the only joyous news I heard.

1:45:57.010 --> 1:45:59.710
We used to yearn for
a grandchild for years.

1:46:00.976 --> 1:46:04.743
Gundogdu and Selcan will make us
live through that joy.

1:46:06.210 --> 1:46:09.676
May God give them the chance
to see their own grandchildren.

1:46:09.943 --> 1:46:12.543
If God permits. If God permits, Bey.

1:47:50.643 --> 1:47:52.610
The Emirate of Aleppo can be seen.

1:47:53.910 --> 1:47:56.576
Put down the banner, bring the tribe flag!

1:48:56.310 --> 1:48:58.510
Rahman! Bring my horse!

1:48:59.510 --> 1:49:01.810
We need to enter
our new homeland on a horse.

1:49:08.510 --> 1:49:09.710
Here you are, Bey.

1:49:17.010 --> 1:49:18.776
Thank you, God.

1:49:19.743 --> 1:49:22.210
You did not leave our tribe without a Bey.

1:52:06.676 --> 1:52:07.943
What is the situation?

1:52:08.210 --> 1:52:11.543
Bey, the front door is guarded
very heavily. There is another door...

1:52:11.676 --> 1:52:14.943
...at the back for provisions,
we may be able to enter from there but...

1:52:15.143 --> 1:52:17.843
...I don't know whether
we would be able to get out.

1:52:19.510 --> 1:52:22.310
People who heard that
the vizier is being tried have gathered.

1:52:22.643 --> 1:52:25.076
The guards are having
a hard time containing them.

1:52:25.176 --> 1:52:28.276
They are convinced that
Sahabettin Tugrul is tried unjustly.

1:52:29.643 --> 1:52:32.910
If we can somehow take the vizier out
we can run away in that turmoil.

1:52:33.043 --> 1:52:35.910
-That is all I can say, Bey.
-Do not listen to him, Bey.

1:52:36.043 --> 1:52:39.643
We don't know where the dungeons are.
It is very hard without help from inside.

1:52:39.743 --> 1:52:42.843
If you ask me, we would be caught
before we even reach Sahabettin.

1:52:42.943 --> 1:52:44.610
What news do you have, Bey?

1:52:45.076 --> 1:52:48.643
I will tell you. First we should go
to the lodge and see how Halime is.

1:53:08.210 --> 1:53:09.310
Yigit.

1:53:11.776 --> 1:53:12.910
Ertugrul.

1:53:14.176 --> 1:53:15.610
Poor Girl.

1:53:16.943 --> 1:53:18.810
Please do not worry, Numan Efendi.

1:53:18.943 --> 1:53:21.876
When we reach the palace
Halime will be much better.

1:53:24.843 --> 1:53:26.243
Hear ye, hear ye!

1:53:30.976 --> 1:53:32.543
Hear ye, hear ye!

1:53:35.143 --> 1:53:36.710
Hear ye, hear ye!

1:53:40.976 --> 1:53:44.310
It had been decreed that
our highness Giyaseddin El Aziz's...

1:53:44.643 --> 1:53:48.243
...vizier Sahabettin Tugrul has been
collaborating with the infidels...

1:53:48.576 --> 1:53:51.610
...and the verdict is
that he is to be executed.

1:53:51.776 --> 1:53:55.843
-Sahabettin is our father!
-He would never do such a thing!

1:54:05.243 --> 1:54:08.110
Bey, let me go and kill them.
To set an example.

1:54:13.210 --> 1:54:17.043
The execution shall take place today
during the afternoon prayer time.

1:54:37.510 --> 1:54:38.710
Master...

1:54:38.976 --> 1:54:43.810
...our fellow Muslim brother
Sahabettin Tugrul is been subjected to...

1:54:44.010 --> 1:54:48.176
...various slanders and is being tried.

1:54:49.043 --> 1:54:54.843
Our hearts ache deeply for him.
What do you suggest we do?

1:54:57.776 --> 1:55:01.143
He Who saved Jonas from
the stomach of the fish...

1:55:01.876 --> 1:55:05.010
...Hiob from the worms
eating his wounds...

1:55:06.243 --> 1:55:08.676
...Joseph from the well...

1:55:09.676 --> 1:55:11.576
...Moses from the Nile...

1:55:13.110 --> 1:55:16.076
...and The Last Prophet from the cave...

1:55:18.710 --> 1:55:21.676
...would save our brother as well
if He wishes to.

1:55:22.876 --> 1:55:24.776
We shall take refuge in Him.

1:55:26.076 --> 1:55:32.043
God, Who turned the fire Abraham fell
into a rose garden...

1:55:32.810 --> 1:55:38.643
...would turn the dungeon where
Sahabettin Tugrul is, into a womb.

1:55:40.643 --> 1:55:46.710
Those who wait tyranny, murder and
betrayal to emerge from there...

1:55:47.776 --> 1:55:51.876
...would be bewildered when
a resurrection emerges.

1:56:50.310 --> 1:56:52.043
Do not worry, Turkmen.

1:56:53.310 --> 1:56:57.976
When I finish with you,
you will not remember any pain...

1:56:58.543 --> 1:57:00.276
...from the things I did to you.

1:58:14.010 --> 1:58:15.510
Hello, young man.

1:58:15.743 --> 1:58:17.543
-Who are you?
-Yigit.

1:58:18.310 --> 1:58:20.076
What are you doing here, Yigit?

1:58:20.276 --> 1:58:23.576
-I was not doing anything bad.
-Were you looking for someone?

1:58:26.210 --> 1:58:27.943
Would you like me to help you?

1:58:31.543 --> 1:58:32.710
Yes.

1:58:32.943 --> 1:58:34.976
Then tell me, who are you looking for?

1:58:35.110 --> 1:58:37.810
-My Turgut Agabey.
-Who is this Turgut Agabey.

1:58:38.510 --> 1:58:40.676
He is a very powerful warrior.

1:58:40.910 --> 1:58:43.910
He is very tall, he has very strong arms.

1:58:44.743 --> 1:58:48.610
So he is very powerful.
Do you like Turgut Agabey very much?

1:58:49.610 --> 1:58:52.610
Yes, I do. He is a very good man.

1:58:53.776 --> 1:58:54.876
Come.

2:00:20.810 --> 2:00:26.010
I am not comfortable
leaving you behind like this, Hatun.

2:00:26.943 --> 2:00:28.210
I don't want to.

2:00:28.676 --> 2:00:32.576
It is God's will, Bey. God forbid,
what if something happens to the tribe...

2:00:32.776 --> 2:00:35.876
...during the migration,
what would they do without Akcakoca?

2:00:47.876 --> 2:00:49.210
Come on, let us go in.

2:01:09.576 --> 2:01:12.276
Everyone thinks that this is
the wisest decision, Bey.

2:01:12.976 --> 2:01:15.176
You gave the best decision like a Bey.

2:01:19.143 --> 2:01:20.676
May God help them.

2:01:21.610 --> 2:01:22.776
Amen.

2:01:25.543 --> 2:01:27.710
Are you two ready for the journey?

2:01:30.876 --> 2:01:32.043
We are, Bey.

2:01:33.043 --> 2:01:34.210
We are.

2:01:36.576 --> 2:01:37.710
Come on, then.

2:01:40.776 --> 2:01:43.910
-In the name of God.
-In the name of God.

2:01:54.710 --> 2:01:56.576
May God be with you, Hatun.

2:01:56.776 --> 2:01:58.743
May you have a clear road.

2:02:42.010 --> 2:02:43.110
Halt!

2:02:43.243 --> 2:02:44.510
Who are you?

2:02:46.010 --> 2:02:50.310
I am from the Bozok branch of Oguz,
Bey of Kayi tribe, Suleyman Shah.

2:02:51.943 --> 2:02:56.110
We are going to the homeland Aleppo Ameer
Giyaseddin El Aziz gave to our tribe.

2:02:56.876 --> 2:03:00.543
We are here on the order of El Aziz.
You are not to enter the city...

2:03:01.043 --> 2:03:04.243
...and we shall escort you until
you leave the Aleppo territory.

2:06:22.643 --> 2:06:26.543
-Let him go, he is not a traitor!
-Let him go!

2:06:35.210 --> 2:06:36.743
Lay Halime down there.

2:07:00.643 --> 2:07:03.710
-Murderers!
-Let him go!

2:07:04.576 --> 2:07:07.143
-You are the real murderers!
-Traitors!

2:07:12.910 --> 2:07:15.776
-You cannot do this!
-You murderers!

2:07:27.543 --> 2:07:31.710
-Traitors!
-Murderers!

2:07:50.510 --> 2:07:53.710
-Traitors!
-Murderers!

2:08:31.710 --> 2:08:34.043
Vizier, do you have a last word?

2:08:43.176 --> 2:08:45.243
Do not remember me as a traitor!

2:08:47.276 --> 2:08:50.876
Whatever I did,
I did for the future of our people.

2:08:53.143 --> 2:08:56.176
Quran is my guide and God is my witness!

2:08:58.810 --> 2:09:00.110
My head is up!

2:09:00.776 --> 2:09:02.110
My cause is God!

2:09:05.210 --> 2:09:07.643
If I need to die for this cause...

2:09:09.610 --> 2:09:11.010
...whether in sleep...

2:09:14.210 --> 2:09:15.743
...or with an axe!
