Episode 18 will start after 12:14 min

12:14.318 --> 12:17.318
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:20.167 --> 12:23.167
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:24.372 --> 12:27.372
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

15:49.371 --> 15:52.337
This is it, sons.

15:52.404 --> 15:56.271
You do not have permission
for the rest of the way.

15:56.337 --> 15:58.337
I will not be back for a while.

15:58.404 --> 16:01.704
Wait here until I am back.

16:02.604 --> 16:08.304
You will not go out of this circle...

16:09.604 --> 16:12.304
-...until I come back.
-Yes, master.

16:17.804 --> 16:19.371
As to you, son...

16:19.437 --> 16:22.871
When I come back,
what lies in your heart will be revealed.

16:22.971 --> 16:27.237
You will not go
out of this circle as well.

16:27.337 --> 16:29.637
Do not worry. I will not.

16:33.937 --> 16:36.571
Alright. May God help you.

17:55.771 --> 17:57.704
Where does Ibn al-Arabi go?

17:58.771 --> 18:01.437
Who knows...

18:01.504 --> 18:03.904
When will the sheikh be back?

18:04.171 --> 18:05.737
Who knows...

18:05.837 --> 18:07.437
What is known, then?

18:08.671 --> 18:11.537
One's place, sir. One's place.

18:12.737 --> 18:15.604
My sheikh told you not to go
out of this circle.

18:15.671 --> 18:18.771
And told you that what lies in your heart
would be revealed.

18:18.837 --> 18:21.471
Sit down and wait.

20:09.437 --> 20:13.304
Peace be upon you.

20:15.837 --> 20:18.471
The community of peaceful people.

20:18.537 --> 20:23.404
Peace be upon you.

20:26.937 --> 20:31.904
May community be beneficial,
your prayers accepted...

20:31.971 --> 20:33.904
...and your hearts joyful.

20:33.971 --> 20:37.604
Welcome. Your brought joy to us.

20:38.571 --> 20:43.804
You were out of our sight,
but you were not out of our hearts.

20:44.271 --> 20:46.337
Thank you, Brother Salih.

20:53.271 --> 20:57.271
Thank God for bringing us together.

20:58.204 --> 20:59.771
Everything is for a reason.

20:59.837 --> 21:02.271
God creates everything for a reason.

21:02.337 --> 21:05.904
Even if we do not know the reason,
we accept our fate.

21:06.704 --> 21:11.937
When I look at the Islamic world, I feel
like we are at times just before Doomsday.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.637
The Islamic ummah
is the ummah just before Doomsday.

21:17.237 --> 21:21.704
Our prophet is the last.
And we are the ummah of the afternoon.

21:22.404 --> 21:26.737
However, only God knows
the exact time of Doomsday.

21:29.637 --> 21:33.604
Our duty is to plant a sapling
if we have one in our hands.

21:35.604 --> 21:39.237
It is God who expands and contracts time.

21:41.204 --> 21:43.371
KAYİ TENT

21:47.471 --> 21:49.404
Gokce...

21:55.637 --> 21:57.471
Ertugrul, press it tight.

21:58.537 --> 22:00.237
Ertugrul, press it tight.

22:00.304 --> 22:01.871
We have to stop the blood.

22:14.437 --> 22:15.704
Ertugrul...

22:26.704 --> 22:28.437
You...

22:29.271 --> 22:31.304
Are you alright?

22:31.371 --> 22:33.271
We will both be alright, Gokce.

22:33.337 --> 22:34.771
Do not worry.

22:42.871 --> 22:44.404
Call the midwifes in.

22:44.471 --> 22:45.571
Alright.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.471
Gokce...

23:24.904 --> 23:29.537
The day our Prophet
conquered Mecca...

23:30.604 --> 23:33.504
...he broke down all the idols
in Kaaba.

23:34.771 --> 23:37.171
How a holy day it was.

23:40.204 --> 23:44.171
Do you think it is easier
to break down the idols inside us...

23:44.271 --> 23:46.937
...than to break down the ones
in Kaaba, Bey?

23:48.304 --> 23:50.171
You are right, Hayme.

23:51.637 --> 23:58.471
The ones who worship idols of arrogance
are all over my tent, even my marquee.

24:00.571 --> 24:03.304
Who are you talking about? Kurdoglu?

24:03.404 --> 24:05.771
It is not only him.

24:05.837 --> 24:09.404
He also poisons my Gundogdu.
I can see that.

24:10.637 --> 24:13.271
You turned out to be right
one more time.

24:13.337 --> 24:19.271
And I made a mistake one more time
by not listening to you.

24:20.937 --> 24:24.771
My son Gundogdu will understand
everything sooner or later.

24:26.337 --> 24:29.437
My blood brother
cannot accept me being the bey.

24:30.371 --> 24:34.937
My decisions are not approved
by our people.

24:36.704 --> 24:40.871
What is the point for me
to be on the seat as a bey?

24:41.204 --> 24:45.237
And I cannot overcome
my own illness, either.

24:48.904 --> 24:52.637
What if they get their foot on the door
when you are not in the marquee?

24:52.704 --> 24:57.271
What if they create obstacles
for the tent with unexpected problems?

24:58.704 --> 25:03.871
I will do what is necessary
until the idols of arrogance are broken.

25:07.271 --> 25:09.471
May I come in, Bey?

25:09.571 --> 25:10.871
Come in.

25:16.937 --> 25:18.871
Alpargu...

25:18.937 --> 25:23.204
...entered Akcakoca's tent
to kill Ertugrul Bey.

25:46.171 --> 25:48.737
Tell me, Adiote. I am listening.

25:49.171 --> 25:51.771
When will this Selcan Hatun matter
come to an end?

25:52.171 --> 25:54.204
When will we be even?

25:54.271 --> 25:56.837
I will tell you when that time comes.

25:56.904 --> 25:58.437
Now, tell me.

26:01.504 --> 26:04.504
Tell me, woman! Can you not talk?

26:04.571 --> 26:08.404
Why did Mother Hayme send men
to his brother Korkut's tent?

26:09.204 --> 26:11.937
What is she up to with her brother?

26:12.504 --> 26:14.171
It is a girl matter.

26:17.871 --> 26:19.371
Girl matter?

26:20.604 --> 26:23.571
What gives?
Who is she trying to find a girl to?

26:26.771 --> 26:28.437
Speak!

26:31.337 --> 26:32.937
To Gundogdu Bey.

27:10.579 --> 27:11.812
Ertugrul...

27:12.412 --> 27:15.379
Let us go and
let the midwives do their work.

27:34.979 --> 27:36.945
Get this bastard out of here.

27:40.912 --> 27:41.979
Wait.

27:45.779 --> 27:48.479
Talk, you low-down bastard! Talk!

27:48.545 --> 27:50.745
Were you the traitor in the tent?

27:50.945 --> 27:52.512
I said talk!

27:52.779 --> 27:55.745
Were you the traitor in the tent,
or was it Kurdoglu?

27:55.812 --> 27:56.812
Talk!

27:56.879 --> 27:58.045
Tell me!

27:58.279 --> 27:59.645
Talk, man!

27:59.712 --> 28:01.512
Talk!

28:04.745 --> 28:06.479
He is dead, Ertugrul.

28:12.279 --> 28:13.512
Take him out.

28:24.312 --> 28:25.612
Ertugrul, son!

28:25.879 --> 28:27.012
Sit down.

28:44.512 --> 28:45.979
How is Gokce?

28:47.445 --> 28:51.545
She almost gave her life to save mine.

28:58.979 --> 29:03.845
The reason that I live is her.

29:20.479 --> 29:23.079
The Islamic world is
going through a big test.

29:23.312 --> 29:25.512
Tests are all around us.

29:25.579 --> 29:29.579
Islam was born as a light,
and it enlightened the world.

29:30.279 --> 29:33.279
But now the Islamic world is on fire.

29:33.912 --> 29:39.412
Our predecessors carried Islam
to Andalucian, India and Sindh.

29:40.479 --> 29:44.379
However, the successors
are busy with ambushing each other.

29:44.479 --> 29:47.645
The magnificent tree
that has taken root in Medina...

29:47.745 --> 29:51.712
...is now being pruned.
Its branches are being broken.

29:52.445 --> 29:55.279
Everything will be alright
when Mahdi comes.

29:55.379 --> 29:57.745
Only what God wants will happen.

29:58.545 --> 30:02.812
We will not sadden.
We will not wait. We will not stop.

30:03.779 --> 30:08.312
We will refuge to God
like in the first days of Islam...

30:08.412 --> 30:10.845
...and we will always strive.

30:10.912 --> 30:14.445
We will make effort
in order for this light to spread.

30:15.745 --> 30:19.579
Has our prophet not ordered us...

30:19.679 --> 30:23.945
...to plant the sapling in our hands
even if it is Doomsday?

30:24.812 --> 30:27.545
Tell us, Sheikh Muhyiddin...

30:27.645 --> 30:31.845
...what is the reason for you
to come here from Andalucia?

30:32.679 --> 30:35.679
Which sapling
did you come here for to plant?

30:39.345 --> 30:43.645
When God wanted me
to come here from Andalucia...

30:45.012 --> 30:48.712
...I noticed this was
a different kind of travel.

30:50.012 --> 30:53.312
I noticed that I would not come back.

30:54.412 --> 30:56.845
I was leaving Andalucia for good.

30:56.912 --> 31:00.479
I refuged to God and asked...

31:01.012 --> 31:04.712
God, I know there is a reason
for everything you create.

31:06.345 --> 31:09.545
What is your reason
for sending me in foreign lands?

31:10.679 --> 31:13.879
God inspired within my heart...

31:16.779 --> 31:19.779
"The reason for this travel...

31:19.879 --> 31:24.912
...is a pearl drop
waiting to me picked out of deep sea.

31:25.079 --> 31:26.779
You will bring him up.

31:27.612 --> 31:29.079
You will train him.

31:29.945 --> 31:32.279
And he will train others.

31:32.912 --> 31:35.845
He will be the
leader of the holy generation...

31:35.945 --> 31:38.745
...that will bring Islam to humanity."

31:56.879 --> 31:58.512
What did you do, man?

31:59.279 --> 32:00.812
God, forgive him.

32:33.379 --> 32:35.312
What are you whispering for?

32:46.445 --> 32:48.379
I said what is going on?

32:48.479 --> 32:50.979
Sister Gokce...
In Akcakoca's tent...

32:51.812 --> 32:55.079
-They say she is seriously wounded.
-What are you talking about?

32:55.312 --> 32:56.779
Alpargu stabbed her.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.445
Bring some water!

33:08.645 --> 33:09.979
Move aside!

33:18.812 --> 33:20.912
Kurdoglu is behind this, father.

33:27.979 --> 33:31.312
-Ertugrul...
-Halime knows it from the beginning.

33:31.945 --> 33:33.679
She is suspicious of him...

33:33.745 --> 33:37.545
...since the day their tent have been
attacked by Kara Toygar.

33:37.612 --> 33:39.612
Just like her late father.

33:39.679 --> 33:41.545
Just like Shahzade Yigit.

33:42.845 --> 33:46.479
I did not say anything to anybody
besides Ertugrul Bey.

33:47.779 --> 33:50.479
Alpargu was one of the
closest beys to him.

33:50.579 --> 33:55.412
It is impossible for him to do such a
thing without Kurdoglu knowing it.

33:55.479 --> 33:58.779
If he is the traitor,
it will be revealed soon.

33:58.845 --> 34:00.012
How?

34:00.279 --> 34:02.745
Gundogdu set up a track.

34:02.812 --> 34:06.412
If you are right,
Kurdoglu will fall into that trap.

34:10.345 --> 34:12.379
I hope you are right.

34:18.412 --> 34:21.012
At last you did this to my sister, too.

34:21.079 --> 34:24.379
It is all because of you, Ertugrul.

34:24.679 --> 34:27.545
The troubles you caused
come back and hit us.

34:27.612 --> 34:28.945
Shame on you!

34:29.012 --> 34:30.412
Selcan!

34:31.345 --> 34:34.412
Alpargu was the one
who tried to kill Gokce.

34:35.012 --> 34:39.045
Direct your hatred to the right person
if you have to.

35:10.679 --> 35:14.679
How could they do this to you, my dear?

35:17.312 --> 35:21.779
Did they stamp on the fresh spring flower
with their boots on?

35:24.679 --> 35:30.012
Did they rip the mare's flesh
before she even sucked milk?

35:32.645 --> 35:38.479
My dear sister, you be well,
and let your sister be buried.

35:59.712 --> 36:02.579
We were all your children.

36:02.645 --> 36:05.612
Until that ominous girl showed up.

36:08.512 --> 36:12.079
Mother, get us out of this trouble
until it is too late.

36:12.745 --> 36:16.879
Or Ertugrul will be the reason
of the disaster that will destroy us.

36:40.779 --> 36:43.079
His name was told to me.

36:43.345 --> 36:47.679
He is such a brave man that
he will bring glory to the Islamic world.

36:48.845 --> 36:51.412
He will turn defeat to victory.

36:54.879 --> 37:00.545
The Islamic tree that was pruned
will turn green again.

37:02.345 --> 37:06.712
The flag of Islam
will extend to Konstantiniyye...

37:06.812 --> 37:08.845
...as our Prophet told us.

37:08.945 --> 37:12.345
Then, it will spread to the whole world
from there.

37:12.412 --> 37:15.912
Muslim, Christian, Jew...

37:16.645 --> 37:18.979
Everybody will be under its shade.

37:19.045 --> 37:24.045
They will drink the water from
Islam's source of life under that tree.

37:25.479 --> 37:29.379
And I was wondering what the reason for
Sheikh Muhyiddin to come here was.

37:29.445 --> 37:31.345
Tell us about that brave man.

37:31.412 --> 37:33.979
So that our prayers will be with him.

37:35.345 --> 37:37.545
So that the help of the elders
will be with him.

37:37.612 --> 37:41.545
What will the person's qualities
that will carry the holy relic...

37:41.612 --> 37:43.979
...that will bring victory to Islam be?

37:48.312 --> 37:53.312
First of all, the person who will carry
the relic will be clever.

37:54.679 --> 37:58.279
However, he will not deem cleverness
as cunningness.

37:59.079 --> 38:01.945
He will look with the light of foresight.

38:02.012 --> 38:05.512
He will distinguish the good and the bad
in a dark night.

38:05.579 --> 38:07.512
He will be merciful.

38:07.579 --> 38:11.479
However, he will not limit mercy
with having pity.

38:12.745 --> 38:14.412
He will be fair.

38:14.512 --> 38:15.912
Hazrat Omar said...

38:16.012 --> 38:19.079
..."Possession and power
is based on justice."

38:19.879 --> 38:23.745
He will know that justice
that does not give God his share...

38:23.845 --> 38:27.045
...is persecution itself.

38:28.312 --> 38:30.945
He will be very brave.

38:31.445 --> 38:32.879
He will have courage.

38:33.479 --> 38:36.512
But he will know that
the strongest courage...

38:36.579 --> 38:41.379
...is holding yourself back
under the situation of anger and lust.

38:41.845 --> 38:46.679
A person who cannot control his hand,
mouth and lust cannot be a ruler.

38:46.945 --> 38:49.312
He will be forgiving.

38:50.279 --> 38:52.079
His fight will be for God.

38:52.812 --> 38:55.812
He will have possessions,
but he will not lay claims on them.

38:55.879 --> 38:59.645
He will see the elders of the people
he rules as his father...

38:59.712 --> 39:02.079
...and the young ones
as his brothers and sisters...

39:02.312 --> 39:04.745
...and the little ones as his children.

39:05.745 --> 39:10.779
He who wants to be the leader of this
ummah should have these qualities.

39:13.345 --> 39:15.612
The community of the peaceful men...

39:16.679 --> 39:19.312
...the ummah waits for
somebody like this.

39:20.345 --> 39:23.045
The troubles we are going through
points out to him.

39:23.279 --> 39:25.079
It is as if we are in the time of dawn.

39:25.312 --> 39:27.845
As if we hear the morning breeze.

39:28.612 --> 39:33.579
Dawn, that is, the closest time
to morning is our time now.

39:39.679 --> 39:42.312
"Give the power to the competent ones.

39:42.379 --> 39:44.679
Give everything back to the ones
who own them."

39:44.745 --> 39:48.079
Of course, our prayers
will be with this brave man.

39:48.312 --> 39:50.012
So, who is this brave man?

39:53.645 --> 39:55.912
Ertugrul, from the Kayi Tribe.

39:56.612 --> 40:02.612
And with God's permission, a big army
that consists of his descendants.

40:13.612 --> 40:14.812
Help!

40:17.345 --> 40:19.545
-Do not worry.
-Help!

40:19.612 --> 40:22.679
Just a man who does not
know his place.

40:22.745 --> 40:24.079
Help!

40:29.079 --> 40:30.745
Would you allow us?

40:33.312 --> 40:34.512
Help!

40:35.912 --> 40:37.845
Help!

41:06.712 --> 41:08.912
Are you alright, Ertugrul Bey?

41:08.979 --> 41:10.879
I am alright, Wild Demir.

41:10.945 --> 41:12.645
And Gokce?

41:12.712 --> 41:14.779
She is seriously wounded.

41:24.979 --> 41:27.012
Was the traitor Alpargu, Bey?

41:28.445 --> 41:30.545
We will know soon, Wild Demir.

41:35.979 --> 41:38.745
I know it is not the time...

41:39.479 --> 41:41.512
...but... our guest, Bey.

41:42.445 --> 41:46.012
Isadora. She wants to say
some important things.

41:46.279 --> 41:47.779
Who are you, my girl?

41:48.412 --> 41:50.445
I am coming from the Templars' castle.

41:50.512 --> 41:52.512
My name is Isadora Manzini.

41:52.579 --> 41:55.412
I am Grandmaster
Petruchio Manzini's niece.

41:56.312 --> 41:59.612
There are things
I would like to tell Ertugrul Bey.

42:10.545 --> 42:11.979
-Isadora?
-Yigit!

42:18.379 --> 42:20.312
It is so good to see you again.

42:31.545 --> 42:34.779
You cannot lay a hand on him
before Gundogdu Bey comes.

42:34.845 --> 42:36.912
Let us make this murderer pay, Hamza.

42:36.979 --> 42:38.912
This bastard stabbed Ertugrul Bey.

42:38.979 --> 42:42.612
There is the blood of
so many Alps in this hands.

42:42.712 --> 42:44.045
Enough!

42:45.445 --> 42:47.612
I will cut whoever comes close up.

42:48.312 --> 42:51.879
Gundogdu Bey left him to me!
Do you not understand?

42:52.645 --> 42:53.912
Hamza!

42:54.745 --> 42:56.545
What is going on here?

42:56.612 --> 42:58.779
Alps want reprisal, Bey.

43:00.079 --> 43:01.812
Reprisal is their right.

43:02.545 --> 43:04.912
But first, it is Ertugrul's right.

43:05.812 --> 43:08.979
Do not forget, Turgut is Ertugrul's alp.

43:09.679 --> 43:12.945
The first person who can
spill his blood is Ertugrul.

43:28.012 --> 43:32.412
Sultan Alaeddin will never forget
what you have done.

43:33.279 --> 43:37.745
As I said, he wants to see
you and Ertugrul Bey in Malatya.

43:39.545 --> 43:43.612
My brother will accept your invitation
when he gets well.

43:44.412 --> 43:46.879
-I would also like to come.
-Of course.

43:47.479 --> 43:49.812
My Alps will escort you to Damascus.

43:51.512 --> 43:54.012
I hope we can meet again,
Gundogdu Bey.

43:54.479 --> 43:57.845
-Give me your blessing.
-You, too, Ersagun Bey.

44:08.412 --> 44:11.812
Hamza, we will take him to tent ourselves.

44:12.812 --> 44:15.779
-Yes, Bey.
-Good. Get that bastard prepared.

44:42.445 --> 44:46.479
Son, you confused us
with your Templar masters.

44:47.979 --> 44:51.445
You cannot go over the line
that is set for you.

44:51.545 --> 44:53.445
You cannot pass it.

44:53.745 --> 44:58.979
It seems like the people that trained you
have not taught you this.

45:01.845 --> 45:06.512
These pains will be with you
until you arrive the Kayi Tent.

45:06.879 --> 45:10.845
Suffer, so that you can understand
the people you made suffer.

45:28.679 --> 45:30.579
Is there not another remedy?

45:31.512 --> 45:35.945
My father said he will be in very serious
pain if he does not take his pills.

45:36.012 --> 45:39.279
And then, unfortunately...

45:39.345 --> 45:41.579
There is another remedy for sure.

45:43.679 --> 45:45.512
I am very sorry.

45:48.612 --> 45:51.079
Is my Turgut going to die?

45:52.612 --> 45:55.779
We will pray all
for him to die without suffering.

45:58.879 --> 46:01.745
Did you come here
to tell us Turgut will die?

46:02.879 --> 46:04.879
No.

46:05.812 --> 46:08.512
I came for my father's death wish.

46:11.745 --> 46:15.779
His Sheikh Ibn al-Arabi
wanted him to help the Kayis in his dream.

46:15.845 --> 46:17.512
That is why I am here.

46:20.712 --> 46:23.679
And if you would like to
bring that ominous castle down...

46:23.745 --> 46:26.012
...I will tell you how to do it.

46:28.812 --> 46:31.845
I cannot take my father
out of there by myself.

46:33.045 --> 46:37.312
But if you attack, there will be
an opportunity for my father.

46:37.379 --> 46:43.079
Tell me, would you recognize that traitor
that came to your castle?

46:47.879 --> 46:50.845
I know he came there twice
to talk to my uncle.

46:52.012 --> 46:54.079
Once I was in the room.

46:55.545 --> 47:00.412
I saw him, but not clearly. I did not
raise my head and look into his eyes.

47:02.379 --> 47:07.312
You cannot imagine how many traitors
come to that castle from these lands.

47:23.612 --> 47:26.779
I wish I could kill that bastard.

47:30.545 --> 47:32.679
It was granted to Sister Gokce.

47:34.479 --> 47:36.579
I hope she will not get sick.

47:37.079 --> 47:41.512
If she had not entered Akcakoca's tent,
Ertugrul Bey would also be...

47:43.712 --> 47:46.579
Do you really believe
this loser is a traitor?

47:46.912 --> 47:47.979
Yes?

47:48.079 --> 47:49.445
No.

47:50.479 --> 47:51.879
I mean, yes, but...

47:51.945 --> 47:53.479
...not by himself.

47:54.779 --> 47:57.945
He is Suleyman Shah's friend
from childhood.

47:58.712 --> 48:00.279
His blood brother.

48:00.345 --> 48:02.712
So, Suleyman Shah cannot believe it.

48:02.779 --> 48:08.045
But we all know from which tent
trouble spreads out.

48:11.912 --> 48:13.512
Come with me, my girl.

48:50.812 --> 48:52.812
Was this the traitor?

49:05.045 --> 49:07.679
He is very similar.
I wish I could remember.

49:22.612 --> 49:23.679
You...

49:23.779 --> 49:25.345
Sister Isadora...

49:26.579 --> 49:29.712
This lady
helped us to break out of the castle.

49:31.512 --> 49:34.412
We would be dead if it was not for her.

50:01.512 --> 50:02.645
Where are you going?

50:02.745 --> 50:04.545
I was going to thump some medicine.

50:04.612 --> 50:05.712
Be quick.

50:05.779 --> 50:07.412
Yes, Selcan Hatun.

50:28.712 --> 50:30.545
Those ominous people...

50:31.845 --> 50:34.479
...put my sweet sister
in this situation.

50:35.679 --> 50:38.712
God damn you all.

50:40.779 --> 50:43.645
Back to work!

50:48.312 --> 50:53.079
My beautiful Gokce.
If anything happens to you...

50:53.412 --> 50:55.912
Gokce Hatun will live, Selcan Hatun.

50:59.312 --> 51:00.645
How do you know?

51:00.712 --> 51:02.679
She is a strong girl.

51:02.879 --> 51:05.612
He will overcome this, too, but...

51:06.579 --> 51:07.812
But what?

51:08.612 --> 51:12.912
The wound is on her groin.
She will not be having a baby anymore.

51:42.679 --> 51:43.812
Look at me!

51:43.912 --> 51:47.679
If anybody hears this,
I will strip your skin with my own hands.

51:47.745 --> 51:52.512
-Do you understand?
-I did. Please let go of me.

51:57.745 --> 51:59.279
Come here tomorrow.

51:59.345 --> 52:03.579
I will give you gold in amount that
you have not seen in your life.

52:16.679 --> 52:18.745
How is Gokce?

52:22.045 --> 52:24.312
She is very well, mother.

52:24.412 --> 52:26.779
She will get well, with God's permission.

52:27.679 --> 52:32.579
I will not let her die
before she gets married.

52:44.045 --> 52:46.345
My revenge will be so harsh.

52:47.445 --> 52:50.979
I will make you pay
for what you made me suffer.

52:51.545 --> 52:54.645
You, your husband...

52:55.779 --> 52:57.379
...and his offsprings.

53:27.345 --> 53:29.879
Uncle Kurdogdu is not around.

53:33.379 --> 53:36.545
If he is the traitor,
whom I think he is...

53:37.345 --> 53:40.412
...he must be
looking for a place to hide.

53:40.479 --> 53:43.712
Bey, you will get mad at me again...

53:43.812 --> 53:47.679
...but what if this woman
is the Templars' new trick?

53:47.779 --> 53:50.079
What if she came for new trouble?

53:50.345 --> 53:52.412
I vouch for her.

53:52.479 --> 53:55.412
She protected
me and the young Shahzade.

53:55.479 --> 53:57.845
And who is going to vouch for you?

53:57.945 --> 54:00.845
Bamsi...

54:00.912 --> 54:02.979
Anybody wants ayran soup?

54:06.412 --> 54:08.945
Forget the soup.
Let us check the horses.

54:09.612 --> 54:10.979
We just checked them.

54:11.045 --> 54:12.545
Then check again, moron!

54:12.645 --> 54:15.279
Do not worry, they will not kick you.

54:21.712 --> 54:23.679
Bey...

54:35.012 --> 54:38.379
Gokce...

54:39.012 --> 54:41.945
She was so young
when she came to our marquee.

54:43.812 --> 54:46.445
She would cry all day in her swaddle.

54:49.279 --> 54:52.879
Her mother died
while she was giving birth to her.

54:54.979 --> 54:58.679
Even though Selcan was
7 years old when she came...

54:58.745 --> 55:01.812
...she was like a
mother and sister to her.

55:04.812 --> 55:07.645
Two girls had come amongst three boys.

55:09.045 --> 55:11.445
Our order was messed up completely.

55:12.345 --> 55:17.079
If my mother could cope with three boys,
it is because of Selcan.

55:19.712 --> 55:21.712
She did not complain even once.

55:23.445 --> 55:27.079
She helped my mother,
and she was like a mother to Gokce.

55:27.979 --> 55:30.279
That is why she is mad at you.

55:31.479 --> 55:33.345
She actually hates you.

55:35.779 --> 55:37.379
It is because of me.

55:40.545 --> 55:41.979
Do not worry.

55:42.045 --> 55:44.379
I can cope with Selcan's anger.

55:45.445 --> 55:47.345
What about Gokce's sorrow?

55:50.412 --> 55:52.045
Can you cope with it?

55:58.445 --> 56:01.012
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS' CASTLE

56:03.479 --> 56:07.979
Sultan Alaeddin must have noticed
that we have sneaked as far as Konya.

56:08.045 --> 56:12.945
Otherwise he would not change his way
and want help from the Kayis.

56:14.379 --> 56:17.712
He does not trust
even the soldiers of the Ayyubid emeers.

56:17.812 --> 56:23.412
Gundogdu escorted the train
because Ertugrul was wounded.

56:24.512 --> 56:27.012
He is as dangerous as Ertugrul.

56:27.979 --> 56:30.079
We need Gundogdu.

56:31.079 --> 56:36.079
If he goes after his ambition,
he will serve us a lot.

56:37.279 --> 56:40.579
When we get rid of
Suleyman Shah and Ertugrul...

56:40.679 --> 56:44.579
...we will leave him
to his uncle's compassionate hands.

56:46.745 --> 56:48.012
Yes, sir.

56:51.012 --> 56:56.079
Bur sir, what about Isadora
and the Cardinal?

56:57.579 --> 57:01.279
I have very nice plans for both of them.

57:02.545 --> 57:04.745
I do not doubt, sir.

57:04.879 --> 57:09.379
You will set off to Damascus
tomorrow with Eftelya.

57:10.612 --> 57:13.645
If we cannot prevent this marriage...

57:13.712 --> 57:19.512
...everything our cult has been
striving for will be under risk.

57:20.912 --> 57:22.445
Do you understand me?

58:11.479 --> 58:12.912
Are you alright, sir?

58:14.712 --> 58:18.312
It feels like the lust of death
is wrapping around my body.

58:19.879 --> 58:22.779
Is it possible to save yourself from it?

58:22.845 --> 58:25.479
Would you like me to call in a healer?

58:26.545 --> 58:29.412
Sleep... Some sleep.

58:48.445 --> 58:50.879
You Teuton half-breed bastard!

58:51.745 --> 58:54.279
I hope you not wake up.

59:25.712 --> 59:27.345
Good.

59:27.879 --> 59:31.512
Even the Grandmaster
could not praise the Templars more.

59:37.512 --> 59:40.545
You deserved to be the Pope
exceedingly, Thomas.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:10.579
If you can reach these passages
and open the closed tunnels...

01:00:10.645 --> 01:00:13.012
...you will reach the dungeon.

01:00:17.879 --> 01:00:20.845
I drew this
according to what my father told me.

01:00:20.912 --> 01:00:23.279
There may be a margin of error.

01:00:23.345 --> 01:00:25.279
Are all the passages closed?

01:00:25.345 --> 01:00:27.312
I know two of them are open.

01:00:27.379 --> 01:00:30.612
But neither my father
nor I know where they are.

01:00:30.679 --> 01:00:32.779
What do you think, Wild Demir?

01:00:32.845 --> 01:00:34.479
Is it possible?

01:00:37.779 --> 01:00:40.079
Bey...

01:00:40.312 --> 01:00:43.445
...it could take months
to open these passages.

01:00:43.512 --> 01:00:45.279
But it is not impossible.

01:00:47.712 --> 01:00:50.012
However, there is something
I am scared of.

01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.979
Think about it.

01:00:52.045 --> 01:00:54.412
If there is a traitor in this tent...

01:00:54.512 --> 01:00:56.579
...and if he informs them...

01:00:56.679 --> 01:01:01.745
...we will fall into trap with hundreds of
Alp trying to pass those passages.

01:01:03.312 --> 01:01:04.845
And nobody will survive.

01:01:10.545 --> 01:01:12.679
Will you not rescue my father?

01:01:17.845 --> 01:01:20.745
I think Wild Demir should check
all the tunnels, anyway.

01:01:20.812 --> 01:01:24.712
If you are right about
what you just said...

01:01:25.412 --> 01:01:27.979
...we will bring that castle
down on them.

01:01:29.712 --> 01:01:31.279
Be patient, my girl.

01:01:32.612 --> 01:01:35.679
We cannot proceed
before we catch the traitor.

01:01:40.679 --> 01:01:42.579
Bey...

01:01:42.912 --> 01:01:48.545
I say we confront my uncle
and Isadora if you permit.

01:01:52.712 --> 01:01:56.412
Let us see what Kurdoglu does
when he sees Isadora.

01:02:19.645 --> 01:02:21.679
This is all because of you.

01:02:23.945 --> 01:02:25.679
It is not because of me.

01:02:25.779 --> 01:02:30.579
-It is because of our common enemies.
-This is not the first time!

01:02:31.579 --> 01:02:35.345
Your father lost his life
in the cause of fighting Suleyman.

01:02:35.412 --> 01:02:38.045
This is nothing.
The game is just starting.

01:02:38.312 --> 01:02:40.745
That girl who came
to the tent, Isadora.

01:02:40.812 --> 01:02:44.445
She is coming from the castle.
She might recognize me.

01:02:44.512 --> 01:02:48.979
Suleyman may call me into the marquee
any moment to confront us.

01:02:50.379 --> 01:02:54.679
If this happens,
it will not be good for any of us.

01:02:56.545 --> 01:02:58.279
What are we going to do?

01:02:58.579 --> 01:03:02.312
First, we must get rid of that Isadora.

01:03:03.979 --> 01:03:05.979
What if she recognizes you?

01:03:20.512 --> 01:03:22.712
Talk!

01:03:22.845 --> 01:03:27.312
What did they give to you?
Did they give gold? Seat?

01:03:28.079 --> 01:03:29.879
My name is Judas.

01:03:32.712 --> 01:03:35.545
They will cause your breed extinct.

01:03:39.679 --> 01:03:43.679
Which are you from?

01:03:48.045 --> 01:03:50.579
Get him out.

01:04:06.745 --> 01:04:07.912
Sit down.

01:04:13.745 --> 01:04:15.779
Tell me. What happened.

01:04:16.079 --> 01:04:19.079
Did anybody from the Templars
or my uncle come?

01:04:19.312 --> 01:04:20.512
No, Bey.

01:04:21.079 --> 01:04:23.445
Neither the Crusaders, nor Kurdoglu.

01:04:23.512 --> 01:04:24.812
Nobody came.

01:04:24.879 --> 01:04:26.979
Then my uncle is not a traitor.

01:04:27.045 --> 01:04:30.979
If he was, they would certainly come
to ambush Alaeddin's train.

01:04:32.345 --> 01:04:34.045
Your uncle is innocent.

01:04:34.279 --> 01:04:39.279
Hopefully, he will be one of your biggest
supporters on the way to be the bey.

01:04:39.579 --> 01:04:43.045
Everybody knows
how much Kurdoglu loves and respects you.

01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:44.712
Be at ease, Bey.

01:04:46.879 --> 01:04:48.479
Thank you, Hamza.

01:04:58.479 --> 01:05:01.045
What would I do
if anything happened to you?

01:05:01.745 --> 01:05:04.745
My dear sister.

01:05:08.545 --> 01:05:11.679
The faithful friend of her sister.

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:18.045
What would I say to my father?

01:05:19.945 --> 01:05:23.479
How could I say
"I could not protect her."

01:05:56.979 --> 01:05:58.412
Father?

01:06:01.945 --> 01:06:03.579
Forgive me, father.

01:06:05.379 --> 01:06:08.779
I could not protect my sister
from Suleyman's offspring.

01:06:10.312 --> 01:06:11.845
Please forgive me.

01:06:33.679 --> 01:06:35.045
May I come in, Bey?

01:06:39.612 --> 01:06:41.079
Come in.

01:06:46.379 --> 01:06:49.479
Suleyman Shah
invites you to his marquee, Bey.

01:06:51.612 --> 01:06:53.545
Go. I am coming.

01:07:47.879 --> 01:07:49.712
I was with Gokce.

01:07:55.945 --> 01:07:57.945
Thankfully, she is alright.

01:07:58.712 --> 01:08:00.645
She will wake up soon.

01:08:08.812 --> 01:08:11.312
Shall I prepare you
something to eat?

01:08:12.312 --> 01:08:13.979
Thank you.

01:08:14.045 --> 01:08:16.379
There is a matter waiting to be solved.

01:08:16.445 --> 01:08:18.312
You better wait inside.

01:08:21.679 --> 01:08:23.979
As you wish, Bey.

01:08:24.045 --> 01:08:26.279
Let me check Dundar, then.

01:08:37.512 --> 01:08:38.879
Here I am, Bey.

01:08:40.154 --> 01:08:41.721
Have a seat, Kurdoglu.

01:09:14.154 --> 01:09:17.754
I think your guest mixed me up
with somebody.

01:09:20.021 --> 01:09:21.354
I am sorry.

01:09:23.754 --> 01:09:25.221
No problem.

01:09:29.254 --> 01:09:31.354
Everybody is similar to somebody.

01:09:40.788 --> 01:09:45.754
What is it, Deli? I have not seen you
with a weapon for so long.

01:09:48.054 --> 01:09:51.654
Wherever a craftsman
girds on his weapon...

01:09:53.088 --> 01:09:56.721
...that place is uncanny
from then on, Kurdoglu.

01:09:59.154 --> 01:10:01.721
For a tent to be out of being uncanny...

01:10:01.988 --> 01:10:07.254
...everybody should be
as outspoken as Ertugrul.

01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:12.454
Outspoken, such that he would
come to my tent in the night time...

01:10:12.521 --> 01:10:15.254
...and blame me of being a traitor.

01:10:16.788 --> 01:10:18.521
Is this true, Ertugrul?

01:10:20.654 --> 01:10:22.154
It is, father.

01:10:23.588 --> 01:10:26.254
I did what my uncle deserves.

01:10:31.288 --> 01:10:33.254
I did not resent, Bey.

01:10:34.221 --> 01:10:36.788
This shows how good his heart is.

01:10:37.021 --> 01:10:38.754
But I will make him pay...

01:10:38.988 --> 01:10:44.454
...when his thoughts
turn out to be delusions.

01:10:48.088 --> 01:10:49.754
Am I right, Ertugrul?

01:10:49.988 --> 01:10:53.721
It is your duty to teach a person...

01:10:53.788 --> 01:10:58.788
...who says bad words
to his elders his place.

01:11:00.288 --> 01:11:06.688
However, even if
one of those bad words are accurate...

01:11:09.054 --> 01:11:14.288
...then everybody is obliged to do
what is necessary.

01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:18.688
Alright.

01:11:24.988 --> 01:11:27.254
They said you wanted to see me, Bey.

01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:34.354
This lady mistakenly
crossed the border and got lost.

01:11:37.788 --> 01:11:40.088
It is best to be cautious, Bey.

01:11:41.388 --> 01:11:45.221
You know everybody who comes
to the tent brings new troubles.

01:11:45.288 --> 01:11:48.088
If this is it, I will do
what is necessary.

01:11:49.121 --> 01:11:50.588
Thank you, Kurdoglu.

01:11:51.688 --> 01:11:52.988
Alright.

01:11:57.088 --> 01:11:58.321
Excuse me.

01:12:11.788 --> 01:12:12.788
What do you think?

01:12:13.054 --> 01:12:14.288
Was it him?

01:12:18.588 --> 01:12:20.321
I wish I could remember.

01:12:29.488 --> 01:12:33.521
It will be very dangerous for you
to return to the castle, then.

01:12:33.688 --> 01:12:38.688
If the traitor is still here,
your end will be like your sister's.

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:14.688
Oh, Ertugrul.

01:13:14.788 --> 01:13:18.054
If you were in your brother's place...

01:13:23.121 --> 01:13:28.154
After all that torture and medicines,
he both forgot his name and his real self.

01:13:31.054 --> 01:13:34.188
The only thing he did not forget
was you, Aykiz.

01:13:36.188 --> 01:13:39.088
No human could resist
those tortures.

01:13:46.721 --> 01:13:49.788
They turned him on a wheel
naked in cold weather.

01:13:58.021 --> 01:14:00.121
They did all kinds of tortures.

01:14:10.454 --> 01:14:14.088
But he did not stop saying your name
even a single moment.

01:14:25.688 --> 01:14:28.588
May God bless you, Isadora.

01:14:55.388 --> 01:14:57.154
Sister...

01:14:58.554 --> 01:15:00.588
Is sister Gokce alright?

01:15:00.654 --> 01:15:01.688
She is, Bey.

01:15:01.754 --> 01:15:03.554
She will wake up tomorrow.

01:15:04.388 --> 01:15:05.988
Thank you.

01:15:34.588 --> 01:15:37.354
You have always been
my little sister, Gokce.

01:15:40.354 --> 01:15:42.454
How did we end up like this?

01:15:44.254 --> 01:15:47.988
How are we going to overcome this
without saddening you?

01:15:48.988 --> 01:15:50.688
How?

01:16:06.121 --> 01:16:09.121
Forgive me for yelling at you,
Ertugrul Bey.

01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:13.254
Gokce is the sister of both of us.

01:16:14.221 --> 01:16:16.121
I understand you.

01:16:16.188 --> 01:16:17.754
We are hurt.

01:16:18.154 --> 01:16:21.254
But nobody is hurt
as much as her, Ertugrul Bey.

01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:28.588
Even the dagger that cut her flesh
did not hurt her as much as you.

01:17:32.054 --> 01:17:33.188
Gokce...

01:17:33.254 --> 01:17:35.454
You know there is something
regarding the two of us.

01:17:35.521 --> 01:17:37.688
My father wants to see you
as his daughter-in-law.

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:40.721
But my heart beats for someone else.

01:17:40.788 --> 01:17:42.788
You are my sister
whom I grew up with.

01:17:43.021 --> 01:17:45.988
There is nothing beyond this for me.
I just wanted you to know that.

01:17:46.788 --> 01:17:48.521
I know, Ertugrul Bey.

01:17:48.621 --> 01:17:51.121
Your heart only says "Halime Sultan".

01:17:51.688 --> 01:17:54.488
One who waits for the loved one
is bound to be saddened.

01:17:55.121 --> 01:17:57.088
I can only accept this saddening now.

01:17:57.321 --> 01:17:59.521
I will not come to you
unless you tell me to.

01:17:59.988 --> 01:18:02.221
I will wait for you until I die
if necessary.

01:18:02.321 --> 01:18:03.554
Do not worry.

01:18:03.654 --> 01:18:06.554
This matter is between you
and your father from now on.

01:18:06.788 --> 01:18:09.688
Keep in mind that I accepted my fate.

01:18:34.388 --> 01:18:37.221
Sometimes you look at the Moon.

01:18:37.288 --> 01:18:38.488
You reach out to it.

01:18:38.554 --> 01:18:40.688
You want to hold it between your hands.

01:18:40.788 --> 01:18:43.121
As if you would hold it tight.

01:18:45.121 --> 01:18:48.188
Next thing you know,
it moves away from you.

01:18:49.721 --> 01:18:51.754
You try again.

01:18:51.988 --> 01:18:53.354
You take another step.

01:18:54.721 --> 01:18:56.421
Then again.

01:18:56.521 --> 01:18:57.988
Again.

01:18:58.088 --> 01:18:59.221
Again.

01:19:03.388 --> 01:19:07.121
No good even if you try
until you reach the end of your rope.

01:19:07.588 --> 01:19:11.388
You are like the Moon
who enlightens my night, Halime Sultan.

01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:15.554
Whenever I reach out to you...

01:19:15.654 --> 01:19:17.654
...whenever I hold you...

01:19:17.721 --> 01:19:21.388
...earth shook and both worlds
tangled into each other.

01:19:22.454 --> 01:19:26.388
My friends became my enemies,
and my enemies became my friends.

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:30.721
The ones I love the most
rubbed salt in my wound.

01:19:30.788 --> 01:19:32.454
Especially, my father

01:19:33.388 --> 01:19:36.754
He wanted me to marry Gokce
as part of his will.

01:19:51.521 --> 01:19:53.554
I have nothing other than you.

01:19:55.521 --> 01:19:58.488
Everything other than you
means nothing to me.

01:20:00.154 --> 01:20:02.721
I may be the one
who enlightens your night...

01:20:02.988 --> 01:20:05.388
...but I receive my light from you.

01:20:06.788 --> 01:20:10.654
You know where I am
when you want to reach out to me.

01:20:10.754 --> 01:20:13.021
I always wait for you there.

01:20:13.588 --> 01:20:15.354
Be at ease.

01:20:17.254 --> 01:20:20.288
Do not ever be in despair
while you love me.

01:20:22.521 --> 01:20:26.621
The taste of love is as much as
the effort made to reach it.

01:20:29.554 --> 01:20:33.088
How could one know
love that does not crack their skin...

01:20:33.154 --> 01:20:36.054
...if they have not burned
in the wind of the steppe.

01:20:36.121 --> 01:20:38.688
Let our wounds bleed first.

01:20:38.754 --> 01:20:41.588
So that we will be satisfied
with the water.

01:20:42.088 --> 01:20:45.354
Let us be hungry,
so that we could enjoy the meal.

01:20:46.054 --> 01:20:49.754
Let us miss each other,
so that we could appreciate rejoining.

01:21:00.788 --> 01:21:03.754
Thank God for the gazelle
that took me to you...

01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:06.421
...and thank God for sending it to me.

01:21:26.554 --> 01:21:29.154
The Cardinal must still be sound asleep.

01:21:29.221 --> 01:21:31.721
He wrote your goals
one by one to the Pope...

01:21:31.988 --> 01:21:33.988
...with the excitement of
being the new Pope.

01:21:34.054 --> 01:21:37.154
Especially his words to
Emperor Friedrich were like a poem.

01:21:37.221 --> 01:21:38.654
He praises you.

01:21:38.721 --> 01:21:40.054
Good.

01:21:40.154 --> 01:21:41.788
Well done, Eftelya.

01:21:42.354 --> 01:21:44.321
Alright. Have a safe trip.

01:21:45.121 --> 01:21:48.088
I am waiting for good news
from Damascus.

01:21:48.154 --> 01:21:50.688
Even if what Thomas said are true...

01:21:50.788 --> 01:21:54.488
...we do not have strength
to bear with such a defeat...

01:21:54.554 --> 01:21:55.621
...after Aleppo.

01:21:55.688 --> 01:21:59.054
We will not allow
the Seljuk-Ayyubid alliance, sir.

01:21:59.121 --> 01:22:02.521
Sultan Alaeddin will never
marry the queen.

01:22:03.788 --> 01:22:05.688
Go, then.

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:07.621
May God help you.

01:22:13.388 --> 01:22:14.721
Titus...

01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:20.721
You did not like
me sleeping with Thomas, did you?

01:22:22.088 --> 01:22:23.688
Everything is for Jerusalem.

01:22:24.588 --> 01:22:26.621
Right, Eftelya?

01:22:26.721 --> 01:22:30.321
Everything is for the holy Crusade
to succeed, Titus.

01:23:08.288 --> 01:23:09.788
Somebody is coming!

01:23:30.621 --> 01:23:33.254
Sir, we captured Ibn al-Arabi, but...

01:23:33.321 --> 01:23:35.788
Damn it! Kayis again?

01:23:36.154 --> 01:23:38.188
No, sir. Claudius.

01:23:40.221 --> 01:23:42.188
Thomas' man Claudius?

01:23:42.654 --> 01:23:44.054
Yes, sir.

01:23:45.421 --> 01:23:48.254
What are you up to, Thomas?

01:23:49.521 --> 01:23:52.054
What?

01:23:52.254 --> 01:23:55.221
That is all for my daily report, sir.

01:23:55.288 --> 01:23:58.621
I still think that we can have
great gains in Jerusalem...

01:23:58.721 --> 01:24:01.021
...by choosing the peace path.

01:24:01.121 --> 01:24:04.221
All parties are weak and disunited.

01:24:06.221 --> 01:24:10.988
Nobody wants war
when Mongols are on their borders.

01:24:12.088 --> 01:24:16.788
Last of all, I will declare a few points
that will determine my thoughts...

01:24:17.054 --> 01:24:19.554
...after the Council of the Templars.

01:24:20.421 --> 01:24:22.554
Cardinal Thomas.

01:25:03.721 --> 01:25:06.354
You left bed early, Ertugrul Bey.

01:25:14.621 --> 01:25:18.254
I thought, let me hurt my pain
instead of it hurting me.

01:25:19.621 --> 01:25:21.588
I am setting off for Ahlat.

01:25:23.588 --> 01:25:26.654
Who knows when we will
see each other again.

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:28.754
I came to have your blessing.

01:25:30.754 --> 01:25:33.454
You served a lot to my tent, Afsin Bey.

01:25:35.321 --> 01:25:37.688
And to Halime Sultan and her family.

01:25:37.754 --> 01:25:39.721
Thank you.

01:25:39.788 --> 01:25:43.421
However, your wrong deeds
saddened me a lot.

01:25:45.454 --> 01:25:47.254
When we went for Turgut,
the black priest...

01:25:47.321 --> 01:25:48.421
Cardinal Thomas.

01:25:48.488 --> 01:25:49.754
Him.

01:25:50.588 --> 01:25:52.354
Told me something.

01:25:52.421 --> 01:25:56.021
What did he say?
I hope it is not something evil.

01:25:56.088 --> 01:25:58.154
That you killed Shahzade Numan.

01:26:06.254 --> 01:26:09.388
I did not have a duty
to kill the shahzade.

01:26:11.021 --> 01:26:15.321
If I did, I would kill him
without batting an eye.

01:26:16.621 --> 01:26:19.354
The continuity of the state
is above all.

01:26:20.354 --> 01:26:23.554
What kind of duty is this?
Who gives this duty?

01:26:31.688 --> 01:26:36.288
We, Oghuz' are still
like the children of the steppe.

01:26:37.154 --> 01:26:42.188
We love to death,
and chase our enemies to death.

01:26:43.221 --> 01:26:46.554
That is, we do everything to death.

01:26:48.388 --> 01:26:51.021
Without thinking about
our front or back.

01:26:51.554 --> 01:26:54.788
We do not even refrain from
endangering this order...

01:26:55.554 --> 01:26:58.254
...or our state.

01:27:01.021 --> 01:27:04.521
Since we do not see anything
both with love and hatred...

01:27:05.388 --> 01:27:09.188
...we need somebody
to remind us what we have.

01:27:10.654 --> 01:27:14.054
The states we have established
are not ownerless.

01:27:15.154 --> 01:27:19.021
The duty is given by the people
who remind us what we have.

01:27:19.621 --> 01:27:21.754
They are more than welcome to us.

01:27:23.754 --> 01:27:26.488
You had so many things to tell,
Afsin Bey.

01:27:29.688 --> 01:27:32.354
This is the least of things to tell.

01:27:32.688 --> 01:27:35.488
Duty is given to us when words fail.

01:27:35.754 --> 01:27:38.988
May our blood and lives
be sacrificed for this.

01:27:40.454 --> 01:27:43.754
Who knows
when we will see each other again.

01:27:43.988 --> 01:27:46.588
I told you
what I have not told anybody.

01:27:47.421 --> 01:27:49.121
It is out of trust.

01:27:50.488 --> 01:27:52.088
Give me your blessing.

01:27:52.154 --> 01:27:53.188
It is yours.

01:27:53.254 --> 01:27:54.754
Goodbye, Afsin Bey.

01:27:55.021 --> 01:27:56.654
Goodbye.

01:28:15.321 --> 01:28:19.754
Ertugrul eggs his mother and father
on against me and his brother.

01:28:21.621 --> 01:28:25.054
Last night they came over me
by just listening to him.

01:28:25.154 --> 01:28:28.288
They will bring this up
at the headquarters today.

01:28:29.254 --> 01:28:31.254
What is their trouble, Bey?

01:28:32.421 --> 01:28:36.121
They think I cooperate
with the Crusaders.

01:28:48.554 --> 01:28:52.621
Their intention is clear, Bey.
They want to finish you.

01:28:56.054 --> 01:28:59.321
But we will not let this happen
as long as we live.

01:29:01.621 --> 01:29:03.088
Thank you.

01:29:18.121 --> 01:29:21.154
Give us your blessing, Afsin Bey.
We owe you so much.

01:29:21.221 --> 01:29:23.154
It is yours, Halime Sultan.

01:29:24.688 --> 01:29:29.321
Do not leave my shahzade alone
and without a prayer.

01:29:31.388 --> 01:29:33.188
Visit him everytime you go to Aleppo.

01:29:34.021 --> 01:29:36.054
You give me your blessing, too.

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:37.588
It is yours.

01:29:37.654 --> 01:29:41.154
I would like to know
if you find my father's murderer.

01:29:42.288 --> 01:29:47.121
The state does not accept the one who
tries to come to the throne with greed!

01:29:56.454 --> 01:29:59.221
What are you going to do with him,
Shahzade?

01:30:01.654 --> 01:30:06.188
He is my father's murderer.
I will kill him wherever I see him.

01:30:29.188 --> 01:30:34.088
They keep track of every step
and every breath we take.

01:30:36.121 --> 01:30:42.721
Sometimes they cross our path,
sometimes they wait to use us.

01:30:44.154 --> 01:30:46.521
They could not have done this...

01:30:46.654 --> 01:30:50.454
...unless they had traitors
in the tent for them to rely on.

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:54.788
They could not have
attacked the shahzades' tents.

01:30:55.054 --> 01:30:58.688
They could not have killed
our Alps who were going to Aleppo.

01:30:59.088 --> 01:31:02.321
They could not infect us with plaque...

01:31:02.388 --> 01:31:05.288
...and provoke the Aleppo emeer
against us.

01:31:06.488 --> 01:31:08.754
The traitor has been revealed, Ertugrul.

01:31:08.988 --> 01:31:10.354
What are you still up to?

01:31:10.454 --> 01:31:15.321
He must still be suspicious. He is saying
there are more than one traitors.

01:31:15.421 --> 01:31:20.621
If Alpagu's corpse in front of the marquee
dis not satisfy you...

01:31:20.788 --> 01:31:23.554
...tell us, Ertugrul,
how many more corpses are required?

01:31:23.621 --> 01:31:25.121
Right.

01:31:25.188 --> 01:31:26.488
Kutlu is right.

01:31:26.588 --> 01:31:28.988
What do you want, Ertugrul?

01:31:29.054 --> 01:31:31.121
When will this tent have peace?

01:31:31.188 --> 01:31:37.188
You are all so numb that you see neither
the front nor the back of things.

01:31:38.454 --> 01:31:44.188
Wild Demir, make the anger
within Ertugrul go away first.

01:31:44.754 --> 01:31:49.421
This anger leads all of us
to uncanny roads.

01:31:50.588 --> 01:31:54.654
It is time for somebody
to stop Ertugrul.

01:31:56.554 --> 01:32:00.088
Tell us, Ertugrul.
Who else are you suspicious of?

01:32:01.654 --> 01:32:03.088
Kurdoglu!

01:32:04.121 --> 01:32:06.088
-What?
-It is impossible.

01:32:14.321 --> 01:32:16.354
I am suspicious of Kurdoglu.

01:32:21.254 --> 01:32:25.788
I see that my niece carried the poison
on his tongue right into the marquee.

01:32:26.688 --> 01:32:30.788
Does my niece want my head,
or my pride?

01:32:31.654 --> 01:32:34.454
Or is there something else
that he wants?

01:32:35.254 --> 01:32:37.521
If Beys also see fit...

01:32:39.488 --> 01:32:42.421
...I want him
to be suspended from his duties...

01:32:42.554 --> 01:32:45.221
...hand his weapon to our Bey...

01:32:45.288 --> 01:32:48.054
...and be kept in this tent
in open arrest...

01:32:48.221 --> 01:32:50.621
...until his innocence is proven.

01:32:52.688 --> 01:32:56.421
Do you have any single thing
to prove what you are saying?

01:32:58.121 --> 01:32:59.188
You do not.

01:32:59.254 --> 01:33:03.088
How dare you come in front of us
and say these words?

01:33:04.088 --> 01:33:07.354
The night that
the Shahzades' tent was attacked...

01:33:07.421 --> 01:33:11.121
...it was Kurdoglu who sent me
away from that tent.

01:33:17.054 --> 01:33:19.021
When we were going to Aleppo...

01:33:19.088 --> 01:33:23.288
...it was Kurdoglu who sent Alps
after us and caused their deaths.

01:33:51.688 --> 01:33:54.654
When I was lying sick in bed...

01:33:54.721 --> 01:33:58.388
...someone came into my marquee
and tried to kill me.

01:33:59.021 --> 01:34:03.321
There are people who saw Kurdoglu
walking around my marquee that night.

01:34:03.621 --> 01:34:05.354
I have their names.

01:34:05.421 --> 01:34:09.088
Even though Gundogdu
kept this assassination a secret...

01:34:10.688 --> 01:34:15.088
...Hayme saw that
the felt of my marquee has been cut.

01:34:15.688 --> 01:34:17.521
And she followed up on that.

01:34:17.621 --> 01:34:20.521
Bey, do you know
what you are talking about?

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:23.321
I am also suspicious of my blood brother.

01:34:24.288 --> 01:34:27.421
I am not only suspicious,
I also know it.

01:34:28.488 --> 01:34:32.254
I also know that you poisoned my son
Gundogdu with your thoughts.

01:34:32.321 --> 01:34:34.154
Enough, Suleyman!

01:34:34.254 --> 01:34:35.521
Talk decently.

01:34:35.588 --> 01:34:40.121
I will not talk you like that
just because we selected you as the Bey!

01:36:32.188 --> 01:36:36.221
I have my eyes
on neither seat nor position.

01:36:42.254 --> 01:36:46.221
I prefer grassing my cattle
and living my life...

01:36:46.288 --> 01:36:49.654
...if otherwise
there will be duality in the tent.

01:36:51.121 --> 01:36:54.621
But if my innocence
is proved one day...

01:36:56.088 --> 01:36:58.988
...Ertugrul will pay for these
words he said!

01:37:12.988 --> 01:37:14.488
Bey...

01:37:14.588 --> 01:37:16.254
My uncle is innocent.

01:37:27.721 --> 01:37:32.321
Uncle, you can put the dagger
my father has given you back.

01:37:32.788 --> 01:37:34.388
I vouch for you.

01:37:36.754 --> 01:37:41.021
Me and my father
set up a trap for my uncle.

01:37:42.188 --> 01:37:44.521
And he came out of it honorably.

01:37:49.421 --> 01:37:52.621
From now on,
whoever talks bad about him...

01:37:53.188 --> 01:37:55.421
...will find me against himself.

01:37:56.421 --> 01:37:58.454
My brother Ertugrul included.

01:37:59.454 --> 01:38:02.688
Leave the delusion inside you...

01:38:03.621 --> 01:38:07.588
...and bring your Alp who stabbed you
from your back to account.

01:38:09.621 --> 01:38:14.354
Turgut ambushed a Seljuk train
together with the Templars.

01:38:14.421 --> 01:38:16.188
And Titus was their leader.

01:38:16.721 --> 01:38:20.988
Ertugrul, you are looking for the traitor
in the wrong place.

01:38:21.054 --> 01:38:23.221
The traitor is among your Alps.

01:38:23.288 --> 01:38:24.488
Brother...

01:38:24.554 --> 01:38:26.321
Do not say anything to me.

01:38:26.421 --> 01:38:28.554
Say what you want to say
to Turgut.

01:38:28.621 --> 01:38:30.588
He is in the marquee square.

01:39:43.121 --> 01:39:45.388
Thank you, niece.

01:39:45.454 --> 01:39:48.554
You saved your uncle
from an ominous defamation.

01:39:58.788 --> 01:40:00.588
Is it not right, Bey?

01:41:43.188 --> 01:41:45.688
Are you the one
who tried to kill my son?

01:41:50.088 --> 01:41:53.388
Are you Turgut
whom I cherished as if he was my son?

01:41:53.454 --> 01:41:54.521
Turgut...

01:41:56.588 --> 01:41:58.588
Or are you an ominous jinn?

01:41:58.688 --> 01:42:00.188
What are you?

01:42:04.288 --> 01:42:05.521
My Turgut...

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:46.688
Ertugrul Bey, demons
have settled into his flesh.

01:42:50.588 --> 01:42:53.221
Turgut inside him has long gone.

01:42:59.221 --> 01:43:01.721
Allow me since I bring him back.

01:43:03.121 --> 01:43:06.321
I will fight the demon inside him
until I die.

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:15.754
Do not kill him.

01:44:18.288 --> 01:44:20.054
You were my brother.

01:44:21.188 --> 01:44:24.154
And you will always be, Turgut Alp.

01:44:44.788 --> 01:44:47.021
Untie him.

01:44:49.088 --> 01:44:51.388
My Alp will not have a punishment.

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:57.521
He will be kept in a cage as precaution
until he gets well.

01:46:12.208 --> 01:46:13.408
How is she?

01:46:14.408 --> 01:46:17.108
She will get well with God's permission.

01:46:19.008 --> 01:46:22.975
But I do not know if the wound
that Ertugrul made will heal.

01:46:24.408 --> 01:46:28.342
She did not hesitate
to sacrifice herself for your brother.

01:46:28.442 --> 01:46:35.242
But Ertugrul did not come to her
even once and say "Get well soon".

01:46:37.342 --> 01:46:40.808
He is unfaithful.
He did not take after you.

01:46:43.975 --> 01:46:45.875
How are you doing?

01:46:45.942 --> 01:46:49.142
I do not know
how I can bear so much pain.

01:46:50.208 --> 01:46:53.308
First, my baby. Then my Gokce.

01:46:56.108 --> 01:46:59.508
It is you who helps me survive.

01:47:00.742 --> 01:47:04.742
You are an important bey
for the Seljuk Sultan.

01:47:04.942 --> 01:47:07.842
The people of the tent
see you as our future.

01:47:08.542 --> 01:47:11.208
I will not leave you alone
in this rough path.

01:47:11.275 --> 01:47:13.508
Now, you have Kurdoglu behind you.

01:47:13.742 --> 01:47:18.275
Your uncle, who proved his innocence.
He will always support you.

01:47:43.408 --> 01:47:45.342
It will be okay, Turgut.

01:47:45.408 --> 01:47:47.342
It will all pass.

01:47:48.042 --> 01:47:49.842
I will not let you die.

01:48:29.875 --> 01:48:31.808
Turgut...

01:48:31.875 --> 01:48:33.375
Turgut...

01:49:05.142 --> 01:49:09.875
Your mother kicked me out of the
rug shop because I lost my baby.

01:49:09.942 --> 01:49:13.808
Everything I did
was in that rug shop.

01:49:15.108 --> 01:49:18.842
She took away everything
that connects me to life.

01:49:19.208 --> 01:49:24.042
She gave it to Gokce on purpose,
to breed bad blood between us.

01:49:26.075 --> 01:49:28.942
You do not know what you are talking
because of your pain.

01:49:29.008 --> 01:49:31.108
Mother Hayme
would not do such things.

01:49:31.175 --> 01:49:33.442
For God's sake, pull yourself together.

01:49:33.542 --> 01:49:35.142
Excuse me.

01:49:36.975 --> 01:49:38.808
Gundogdu...

01:49:40.475 --> 01:49:43.475
You still do not respect
what I say, do you?

01:49:43.742 --> 01:49:48.342
You are right, she was like your mother
even though she did not breastfeed you.

01:49:48.908 --> 01:49:52.808
She fed and brought you up.

01:49:53.008 --> 01:49:56.308
She did not let you feel
the lack of your mother.

01:49:56.408 --> 01:49:58.442
But nothing is as it seems.

01:49:58.542 --> 01:50:03.008
You dried up both yourself and me
with your delusions, woman.

01:50:03.175 --> 01:50:04.542
Delusions?

01:50:05.908 --> 01:50:09.142
So you do not respect me
as much as that woman.

01:50:10.442 --> 01:50:12.842
It is too late.

01:50:12.908 --> 01:50:14.742
I will go away.

01:50:15.842 --> 01:50:16.842
Selcan!

01:50:16.908 --> 01:50:19.108
Yes, I will.

01:50:19.208 --> 01:50:22.775
I am a woman who cannot even
carry your baby.

01:50:23.508 --> 01:50:26.175
I will go away
when my sister gets well.

01:50:27.442 --> 01:50:29.075
Let me go.

01:50:29.142 --> 01:50:32.108
I am begging you, Gundogdu.

01:50:32.175 --> 01:50:34.142
There is nothing more.

01:50:34.242 --> 01:50:37.108
There is neither peace nor happiness
in this tent anymore.

01:50:37.175 --> 01:50:39.308
Selcan! Pull yourself together!

01:50:39.975 --> 01:50:42.175
I just wanted you to have peace.

01:50:42.242 --> 01:50:46.908
You are both my peace and my woman.

01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:52.242
Then why does your mother
look for a woman for you...

01:50:52.342 --> 01:50:55.242
...in her elder brother Korkut's tent?

01:50:57.275 --> 01:50:58.808
I do not understand.

01:50:59.942 --> 01:51:01.875
I was not going to say...

01:51:01.942 --> 01:51:03.908
...but you forced me to.

01:51:04.042 --> 01:51:06.142
Just forget it.

01:51:27.542 --> 01:51:29.275
So, just like that.

01:51:30.542 --> 01:51:33.208
He warded off all the suspicions.

01:51:33.308 --> 01:51:37.175
The death of so many Alps,
so many instigations.

01:51:38.142 --> 01:51:42.008
It is all on that Alpargu bastard now.

01:51:43.842 --> 01:51:45.842
Enough, Hayme. Enough.

01:51:49.541 --> 01:51:53.075
Kurdoglu came out of Gundogdu's
trick blamelessly.

01:51:53.408 --> 01:51:55.975
The traitor was Alpargu. It is over.

01:51:57.308 --> 01:51:59.242
Kurdoglu is innocent.

01:51:59.308 --> 01:52:01.108
Everybody witnessed that.

01:52:01.175 --> 01:52:03.308
This matter is closed. Finished.

01:52:05.242 --> 01:52:07.142
What do they want from you, then?

01:52:07.208 --> 01:52:11.942
To withdraw. Do you not see?
To withdraw.

01:52:13.408 --> 01:52:16.442
Our people are after welfare,
not traditions.

01:52:17.775 --> 01:52:20.375
Kurdoglu sees their problem
more than me.

01:52:21.542 --> 01:52:24.042
He sees it and wants me to withdraw.

01:52:24.242 --> 01:52:27.142
And he will replace Gundogdu with me.

01:52:27.242 --> 01:52:29.442
This is the truth.

01:52:29.742 --> 01:52:33.008
Even though you do not want to hear
that I got older...

01:52:33.108 --> 01:52:37.475
...and our people do not say anything
out of respect, this is the truth.

01:52:38.975 --> 01:52:41.275
May I come in, father?

01:52:41.342 --> 01:52:43.008
Come in.

01:52:48.375 --> 01:52:52.342
I have some things to say
to both of you, if you permit.

01:52:55.808 --> 01:52:57.075
Father...

01:52:57.908 --> 01:53:02.542
...you will break up my family
unless you marry Gokce and Ertugrul.

01:53:05.108 --> 01:53:08.842
Do not do what my mother
has been trying to do for so long.

01:53:10.075 --> 01:53:11.375
Gundogdu!

01:53:13.142 --> 01:53:17.742
Do you hear what you are saying?
What kind of words are these?

01:53:17.808 --> 01:53:19.208
Mother...

01:53:19.275 --> 01:53:23.875
...I know you have been looking for a
woman for me in my uncle's tent.

01:53:27.408 --> 01:53:29.042
We are already in pain.

01:53:29.108 --> 01:53:32.008
For God's sake,
do not increase our pain.

01:53:32.075 --> 01:53:35.208
Bring Selcan back to the rug shop.

01:53:35.808 --> 01:53:39.375
I do not want my family to be broken
because of the bad blood between you.

01:53:39.542 --> 01:53:42.108
I do not want anything else from you.

01:53:42.542 --> 01:53:43.975
Excuse me.

01:53:53.942 --> 01:53:55.508
What did you do, Hayme?

01:54:23.375 --> 01:54:25.275
Greetings, Halime Sultan.

01:54:25.775 --> 01:54:27.342
Greetings, Ertugrul Bey.

01:54:54.208 --> 01:54:56.942
You wanted to be daughter of the tent...

01:54:58.408 --> 01:55:02.108
...instead of living in palaces
and being Halime Sultan.

01:55:02.175 --> 01:55:04.942
Every place I am in with you
is my palace.

01:55:05.808 --> 01:55:09.075
I am only the sultan of your heart,
Ertugrul Bey.

01:55:09.142 --> 01:55:11.242
And the Oghuz Tent is our home.

01:55:14.542 --> 01:55:18.008
You wish to be
my father's daughter, but...

01:55:18.075 --> 01:55:22.342
...you must take the chance of
going away with me when the time comes.

01:55:23.442 --> 01:55:27.008
I would go
to the far end of the world with you.

01:55:27.075 --> 01:55:28.908
And I would not ask why.

01:55:31.108 --> 01:55:33.942
But I know why you are leaving your tent.

01:55:35.975 --> 01:55:38.242
That is why I am worried, anyway.

01:55:41.408 --> 01:55:45.875
If I disregard my father's legacy,
my Bey's order...

01:55:46.442 --> 01:55:49.942
...I cannot stay in this tent
and look at his face anymore.

01:55:51.908 --> 01:55:53.508
Will you disregard it?

01:55:58.275 --> 01:56:01.142
I can only leave this tent
with my loved one.

01:56:19.142 --> 01:56:22.075
I wish I taught you about
women's tricks...

01:56:22.175 --> 01:56:24.842
...like I taught how to use weapons.

01:56:24.942 --> 01:56:26.975
You were caught unprepared.

01:56:28.075 --> 01:56:30.242
Do not say that, uncle.

01:56:30.308 --> 01:56:34.175
On one side is my mother,
and on the other, my wife.

01:56:34.308 --> 01:56:37.008
These are all games of throne, Gundogdu.

01:56:37.308 --> 01:56:39.508
Games to make you tired and whelmed.

01:56:39.742 --> 01:56:42.308
And Hayme is behind all of them.
It is so clear.

01:56:42.375 --> 01:56:45.442
I had told you. Selcan Hatun
had told you, as well.

01:56:45.508 --> 01:56:48.908
He is panicked because
his ruling power is about to finish.

01:56:48.975 --> 01:56:50.542
These are all temporary.

01:56:50.775 --> 01:56:53.142
Ertugrul also cannot see these games.

01:56:53.242 --> 01:56:57.542
He has his mother behind him.
It is her who oppresses him this much.

01:56:58.108 --> 01:57:00.108
Do not worry.

01:57:00.175 --> 01:57:03.908
When you enter the marquee
and be the bey...

01:57:03.975 --> 01:57:06.108
...everything will be passed.

01:57:06.175 --> 01:57:08.808
And we will be with each other again.

01:57:08.875 --> 01:57:12.275
The elders in the tent
will also adapt to their new lives.

01:57:13.742 --> 01:57:16.108
By the way, I have good news for you.

01:57:17.542 --> 01:57:21.442
Tatos Harput
just sent the money for the flock.

01:57:30.208 --> 01:57:32.775
Uncle... these are...

01:57:32.875 --> 01:57:37.475
These freckles of gold
are all your success.

01:57:38.375 --> 01:57:42.142
You cannot be a bey just by girding on
your weapon and defeating the infidels.

01:57:42.208 --> 01:57:44.542
You will feed your people first...

01:57:44.808 --> 01:57:49.775
...so that they will fight for you
when you want them to.

01:57:51.408 --> 01:57:55.875
Neither an Alp's mother
nor wife will say anything to you.

01:57:55.975 --> 01:57:59.408
Now, do what is necessary
on the path to be the bey...

01:57:59.475 --> 01:58:01.175
...and give a feast.

01:58:03.208 --> 01:58:08.208
Let the people know their future bey
who will live in the marquee from now on.

01:58:30.142 --> 01:58:31.975
My heart aches, Aktolgali.

01:58:35.208 --> 01:58:41.175
But I know that it is that ache
that will lead me to the victory.

01:58:42.008 --> 01:58:45.975
Neither Kara Toygar nor the Templars.

01:58:47.842 --> 01:58:49.508
None of them was a victory.

01:58:55.275 --> 01:59:00.742
They mean nothing unless
I finish the instigation within my tent.

01:59:03.342 --> 01:59:07.075
A wind that is even incapable of
hurting a spring branch...

01:59:07.142 --> 01:59:08.908
...will destroy my tent.

01:59:16.008 --> 01:59:18.508
The war just started, Aktolgali.

01:59:20.442 --> 01:59:22.342
God help us.

01:59:39.475 --> 01:59:40.942
Well done.

02:00:05.742 --> 02:00:08.008
Women...

02:00:12.342 --> 02:00:14.942
You heard what happened to Gokce.

02:00:16.075 --> 02:00:20.375
From now on,
Selcan Hatun will run the rug shop.

02:00:21.242 --> 02:00:23.108
Her words are my words.

02:00:24.042 --> 02:00:26.242
Good luck. Everybody back to work.

02:00:28.408 --> 02:00:33.442
I hope you will not interfere with
my work and family from now on.

02:00:38.208 --> 02:00:41.142
I brought you up
since you were seven years old.

02:00:41.208 --> 02:00:44.308
I was by your side at all times
like a mother.

02:00:45.508 --> 02:00:47.342
When did you become that?

02:00:56.508 --> 02:00:59.108
Your mother was my dearest friend.

02:01:00.508 --> 02:01:03.208
How could you be born
from such a woman?

02:01:04.175 --> 02:01:08.508
How could somebody like you
be brought up in my marquee?

02:01:10.442 --> 02:01:11.808
Shame on you.

02:01:11.942 --> 02:01:14.475
If everybody knows their place...

02:01:14.542 --> 02:01:19.942
...you will be my mother,
and I will be your daughter.

02:01:20.808 --> 02:01:22.408
It is that easy.

02:01:23.975 --> 02:01:28.108
Sons talk instead of the elders.

02:01:29.008 --> 02:01:32.775
Girls give orders instead of mothers.

02:01:35.108 --> 02:01:37.042
God help us all.

02:01:41.142 --> 02:01:43.342
Women!

02:01:45.842 --> 02:01:50.008
We will weave so many rugs this year
that the tent has never seen.

02:01:52.742 --> 02:01:55.475
I will have four new weaving benches made.

02:01:59.442 --> 02:02:02.208
Our rugs will be in all benches...

02:02:02.275 --> 02:02:07.342
...from Aleppo to Damascus,
from Konya to Antioch.

02:02:07.975 --> 02:02:09.075
Understood?

02:02:09.142 --> 02:02:10.508
Understood!

02:02:18.308 --> 02:02:23.508
We will see who is stronger, Mother Hayme.

02:02:41.408 --> 02:02:43.342
Umur...

02:02:51.042 --> 02:02:54.442
22 cattle, 3 camels and 67 goats.

02:02:54.508 --> 02:02:56.242
-Is it right?
-It is.

02:02:58.108 --> 02:02:59.508
63 coins.

02:03:00.242 --> 02:03:02.942
-Enjoy it.
-God bless you, Bey.

02:03:03.308 --> 02:03:05.442
May God keep you among us.

02:03:05.508 --> 02:03:07.942
Thank you. Enjoy it.

02:03:10.908 --> 02:03:12.942
Yagiz...

02:03:15.775 --> 02:03:19.542
33 cattle, 7 camels and 123 goats.
Is it right?

02:03:19.775 --> 02:03:21.242
It is.

02:03:21.908 --> 02:03:23.408
103 coins.

02:03:23.508 --> 02:03:25.775
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you, Bey.

02:03:25.842 --> 02:03:29.742
They have said you were different,
but I have not believed back then.

02:03:29.808 --> 02:03:31.175
Thank you.

02:03:32.275 --> 02:03:34.408
Gundogdu's day is today.

02:03:34.508 --> 02:03:38.975
But the Alps are not happy about this.

02:03:40.075 --> 02:03:42.808
They will shut up when we go to war.

02:03:45.308 --> 02:03:47.808
-God bless you, Bey.
-You, too. Enjoy it.

02:03:48.942 --> 02:03:51.275
-Thank you, Bey!
-God bless you, Bey!

02:04:00.042 --> 02:04:02.142
Thank you. God bless you, too.

02:04:02.908 --> 02:04:05.475
I know what the troubles
you were putting up with for so long.

02:04:05.742 --> 02:04:08.442
These hard times are over now.

02:04:09.542 --> 02:04:12.008
All of you had your shares.

02:04:12.908 --> 02:04:16.475
With God's permission,
we will earn more from now on.

02:04:16.542 --> 02:04:18.542
-Yes, Bey.
-Yes, Bey.

02:04:19.442 --> 02:04:23.342
Tomorrow night, I will give a feast
at the marquee square...

02:04:23.408 --> 02:04:26.208
...to beys, flock owners and shepherds.

02:04:26.275 --> 02:04:27.475
You are all invited!

02:04:27.542 --> 02:04:31.075
-Thank you, Bey!
-Thank you!

02:04:33.475 --> 02:04:36.008
Thank you. God bless you, too.

02:04:51.408 --> 02:04:54.042
What is Gundogdu up to, Ertugrul?

02:05:04.475 --> 02:05:07.375
Your elder brother
is playing a dangerous game.

02:05:08.275 --> 02:05:11.142
It is your duty to wake him up
as his brother.

02:05:15.942 --> 02:05:20.108
Your father is stuck
between the people he loves and his duty.

02:05:22.308 --> 02:05:26.308
Even my father is stuck
between the anvil and the hammer...

02:05:26.408 --> 02:05:30.242
...this will only make him
tougher and stronger, Wild Demir.

02:05:32.908 --> 02:05:35.308
Surely, there is something he knows.

02:05:36.775 --> 02:05:40.942
The moment my father takes a step,
I will follow him running.

02:06:10.875 --> 02:06:13.008
Gundogdu has sold the flock.

02:06:14.275 --> 02:06:19.308
They say that our people earned money in
amount that they have never seen before.

02:06:21.142 --> 02:06:24.375
Gundogdu will give a feast
tomorrow night...

02:06:25.408 --> 02:06:28.275
...to the beys, shepherds
and flock owners.

02:06:31.208 --> 02:06:34.242
He is doing this without letting me know.

02:06:34.342 --> 02:06:38.275
He invited me by sending Abdullah to me.

02:06:40.742 --> 02:06:42.542
Our people are very happy.

02:06:43.775 --> 02:06:46.542
He sold the flock for a very high price.

02:06:49.242 --> 02:06:53.308
I do not know how those weak cattle
cost that much money.

02:06:56.808 --> 02:07:00.108
Selcan told me
not to come to the rug shop anymore.

02:07:01.242 --> 02:07:04.342
They do not want us
because we got older, woman.

02:07:07.475 --> 02:07:11.308
I told you that it was time for me
to withdraw for a reason.

02:07:14.875 --> 02:07:20.275
Kurdoglu would want to
nominate Gundogdu and destroy you.

02:07:23.208 --> 02:07:26.208
Who knows what he will do next.

02:07:26.275 --> 02:07:31.208
But it would not surprise me
if he spends Gundogdu like he did to you.

02:07:33.442 --> 02:07:37.942
It is our duty to do what is necessary.

02:07:44.308 --> 02:07:49.108
I will look after Sister Isadora
until the border. Do not worry.

02:07:49.175 --> 02:07:50.375
Good luck.

02:07:51.542 --> 02:07:53.375
I am grateful to you, Isadora.

02:07:53.442 --> 02:07:55.475
I will never forget this.

02:07:56.075 --> 02:07:57.842
God save you.

02:07:57.908 --> 02:07:59.075
Goodbye.

02:07:59.175 --> 02:08:00.542
Please be careful.

02:08:01.508 --> 02:08:04.375
It is possible that
we still have a traitor in our tent.

02:08:04.442 --> 02:08:06.308
Your life may be in danger.

02:08:06.375 --> 02:08:09.408
As Turks say,
let us hope for the best.

02:08:12.942 --> 02:08:16.442
I leave Halime Sultan
and Shahzade Yigit to you.

02:08:20.908 --> 02:08:22.342
Thank you.

02:08:23.508 --> 02:08:25.875
May God protect you.

02:08:26.808 --> 02:08:27.975
Alright.

02:08:53.442 --> 02:08:55.508
I will take care of him.

02:08:55.742 --> 02:08:57.742
I will not let him die.

02:09:05.208 --> 02:09:07.742
Ertugrul Bey, will you come with me?

02:09:08.242 --> 02:09:11.108
There is something
I would like to show you.

02:09:24.842 --> 02:09:26.042
Turgut...

02:09:32.508 --> 02:09:34.142
Turgut...

02:09:34.242 --> 02:09:36.808
Do not do that.

02:09:38.342 --> 02:09:40.042
Do not do that.

02:09:43.242 --> 02:09:47.042
Do not surrender to the poison inside you.
I am begging you.

02:09:48.408 --> 02:09:50.108
Alright.

02:09:53.275 --> 02:09:55.142
No! Look at me.

02:09:55.242 --> 02:09:57.975
Look at me. Alright. Please.

02:10:00.342 --> 02:10:01.342
Turgut!

02:10:01.408 --> 02:10:02.775
Turgut!

02:10:03.375 --> 02:10:04.908
Get up.

02:10:10.542 --> 02:10:11.942
Get up.

02:10:13.308 --> 02:10:15.475
Please, do not do that.

02:10:16.775 --> 02:10:19.175
It is okay.

02:10:20.242 --> 02:10:22.742
It is okay.

02:10:32.908 --> 02:10:35.042
Alright. It is okay.

02:10:37.808 --> 02:10:40.042
It is okay.

02:10:40.108 --> 02:10:43.808
Do you remember when you told me
that you loved me?

02:10:45.042 --> 02:10:46.142
Do you?

02:10:49.842 --> 02:10:52.175
I will tell you everything.

02:10:52.242 --> 02:10:54.908
You will know who you are, Turgut.

02:10:55.008 --> 02:10:58.442
I will tell you everything
from the very beginning.

02:10:58.542 --> 02:11:02.308
I will give you back
everything that they made your forget.

02:11:05.442 --> 02:11:07.242
Alright. It is okay.

02:11:09.008 --> 02:11:10.975
It is okay.

02:11:27.875 --> 02:11:32.342
Ibn al-Arabi allowed only the two of us
to know the existence of this chest.

02:11:35.508 --> 02:11:37.508
Did he say anything else?

02:11:37.742 --> 02:11:40.142
He told us not to open it ever.

02:11:40.242 --> 02:11:43.108
He will take it back from us
when he gets back.

02:11:44.042 --> 02:11:50.042
Isadora said that his father
talked about Arabi's relic.

02:11:52.408 --> 02:11:56.442
I do not know if there is a relation.
I just wanted you to know.

02:12:35.908 --> 02:12:37.442
Welcome, Bey.

02:12:49.342 --> 02:12:53.442
-God is Haqq!
-God is Hayy!

02:12:53.742 --> 02:12:57.908
-God is Haqq!
-God is Hayy!

02:13:00.908 --> 02:13:02.942
The time is now, Wild Demir.

02:13:04.142 --> 02:13:06.875
I am with you until my last breath, Bey.

02:13:10.842 --> 02:13:15.475
-God is Haqq!
-God is Hayy!

02:13:15.542 --> 02:13:18.342
God is Haqq!

02:13:38.542 --> 02:13:40.175
Isadora!

02:13:40.308 --> 02:13:42.975
My angel!
I got so worried about you!

02:13:43.975 --> 02:13:46.442
Are you alright? What happened?

02:13:46.542 --> 02:13:48.175
I got lost, uncle.

02:13:48.242 --> 02:13:50.542
At last, a villager helped me.

02:13:51.008 --> 02:13:52.342
I am very tired.

02:13:52.408 --> 02:13:55.042
I will tell you everything
after I get some rest.

02:13:55.108 --> 02:13:58.442
Go, honey. Rest will do you good.

02:13:59.908 --> 02:14:02.542
By the way...

02:14:02.775 --> 02:14:05.175
...there is something you should know.

02:14:06.375 --> 02:14:08.308
What is it?

02:14:08.475 --> 02:14:10.842
Mario...

02:14:10.908 --> 02:14:13.108
They found him dead the other day.

02:14:13.942 --> 02:14:16.175
He hung himself.

02:15:07.408 --> 02:15:11.175
Everything will change
after the feast tomorrow night.

02:15:11.242 --> 02:15:15.008
Everybody will see
that we are not ordinary shepherds.

02:15:15.075 --> 02:15:20.208
We will revive this seigniory
with trophy raids on the Orthodoxes.

02:15:20.942 --> 02:15:23.775
This gold you see is just the beginning.

02:15:23.842 --> 02:15:26.242
Now, our Gundogdu Bey waits for you.

02:15:34.175 --> 02:15:37.908
Ertugrul Bey would get hold of him
if he was not his elder brother.

02:15:39.908 --> 02:15:43.908
Who are you to give a feast
when there are beys to do that?

02:15:45.175 --> 02:15:46.942
You...

02:15:47.075 --> 02:15:51.042
I would say, "Gundogdu,
do you know what you are doing?"

02:15:52.742 --> 02:15:55.808
And what about that jackal, Kurdoglu?

02:15:55.875 --> 02:15:58.508
All kinds of instigation is his doing.

02:15:58.808 --> 02:16:01.742
I have half a mind to
grab his collar and...

02:16:03.775 --> 02:16:06.275
God forgive me. What am I saying?

02:16:08.075 --> 02:16:10.542
So, are you not going to the feast?

02:16:12.142 --> 02:16:17.508
They will eat sheep and camel,
and you will not go?

02:16:19.275 --> 02:16:22.075
I would not go there
even if I died from my pain.

02:16:23.442 --> 02:16:25.175
My brother!

02:16:34.775 --> 02:16:37.542
Both of you are going to that feast.

02:16:39.375 --> 02:16:41.542
As I always say...

02:16:41.775 --> 02:16:45.142
...we left the meal to them,
but the hunt will be ours.

02:16:46.508 --> 02:16:47.908
Understood?

02:16:48.975 --> 02:16:50.142
Understood, Bey.

02:16:50.208 --> 02:16:51.475
Understood, Bey.

02:16:59.442 --> 02:17:01.275
Congratulations, Bey.

02:17:07.175 --> 02:17:10.542
Everybody knows that
you are different now.

02:17:10.975 --> 02:17:14.475
You are the chief pillar of this tent
after your father.

02:17:14.542 --> 02:17:18.842
And you will be the one who keeps
this tent up after your father.

02:17:19.908 --> 02:17:22.408
May God keep you among us.

02:17:23.308 --> 02:17:26.042
The feast you are going to give
tomorrow night...

02:17:26.108 --> 02:17:29.441
...will seal you as the future bey.

02:17:29.542 --> 02:17:31.242
May I come in, Bey?

02:17:34.975 --> 02:17:37.242
Come in, Karabudak. Come in.

02:17:45.475 --> 02:17:47.908
We came here to wish you good luck, Bey.

02:17:47.975 --> 02:17:50.775
We want you to know that
we are always with you.

02:17:50.842 --> 02:17:53.742
Thank you, Kutlu. Thank you, Karabudak.

02:17:54.408 --> 02:17:56.342
We are going on a path with you.

02:17:56.441 --> 02:17:58.742
But it does not end in Aleppo.

02:17:58.842 --> 02:18:00.542
It ends in the tomb.

02:18:03.875 --> 02:18:08.742
We would like to see you as the new bey
of the Kayis when the time comes.

02:18:08.808 --> 02:18:10.242
If God permits.

02:18:10.342 --> 02:18:13.375
We would like to kiss your hand
if you permit.

02:18:37.775 --> 02:18:40.308
Father, this is the best day of my life.
