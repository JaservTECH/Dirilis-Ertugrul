Episode 24 will start after 12:18 min

12:18.884 --> 12:21.884
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:23.626 --> 12:26.927
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:27.783 --> 12:30.783
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:45.802 --> 12:48.235
The castle is surrounded by the cliff.

12:48.302 --> 12:50.935
An on-target attack is nearly impossible.

12:51.335 --> 12:54.268
The only way in is from that direction.

12:55.902 --> 12:58.835
We know that they prepared two tunnels.

12:59.168 --> 13:02.302
One of them is known to us but closed.

13:03.302 --> 13:07.068
Wild Demir shall open that tunnel
so that our warriors can pass through.

13:08.368 --> 13:10.668
We do not know the other one's location.

13:10.835 --> 13:13.168
Omer went to find out
the second tunnel's location.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.802
According to Isadora, no one but...

13:14.868 --> 13:17.968
...The Master and Titus knows about the
second tunnel.

13:18.368 --> 13:22.668
If we act hasty and try to get in through
the doors or over the wall...

13:22.868 --> 13:25.068
...this shall be both the raid's
and our end.

13:26.635 --> 13:29.235
More importantly, we must cut their
all communication with the outside off...

13:29.302 --> 13:30.402
...and isolate them.

13:30.735 --> 13:34.368
If we can get in the castle through
the tunnels with 40 warriors...

13:34.668 --> 13:36.235
... we may able to open the doors
from the yard.

13:36.368 --> 13:40.102
Just like the 40 warriors of Kursat,
40 warriors are enough, my Bey.

13:40.702 --> 13:43.002
I would like to be one of them
if you do not count me as an old man...

13:43.268 --> 13:45.202
...and let me join.

13:46.235 --> 13:48.168
I saw my daughter's marriage too.

13:48.235 --> 13:50.602
I have nothing to fear in this world.

13:50.802 --> 13:52.202
You are right, Wild Demir.

13:52.702 --> 13:55.968
Get us into this castle,
with God's permission.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.868
Do not worry, my Bey. I shall succeed.

13:59.168 --> 14:01.635
If they call for help from
The Principality of Antioch...

14:01.902 --> 14:03.235
...we shall be caught in a trap.

14:04.368 --> 14:08.068
If the tunnel opens
later than we anticipated...

14:08.202 --> 14:10.035
...the isolation can be prolonged.

14:10.735 --> 14:14.168
In that case,
women shall provide ammunition...

14:14.235 --> 14:15.902
...and subsistence to the Alps.

14:16.302 --> 14:19.302
We shall be at war on both sides then.

14:20.135 --> 14:25.635
When we march, the nomad group,
ammunition and subsistence shall be...

14:25.702 --> 14:28.102
...on Gundogdu's responsibility.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.935
As you command, my Bey.

14:42.702 --> 14:45.368
Come on, God is just!

14:45.968 --> 14:47.168
Come on!

14:48.235 --> 14:50.135
Hit it hard my brave ones!

14:50.368 --> 14:52.368
It is the day of conquest.

14:52.902 --> 14:56.635
Dogan, Dogan! Take wing, Dogan!

14:59.235 --> 15:01.602
I hope it is all well, Bamsi,
you seem to be in a good mood.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.102
Yes, brother, the goat came back too.

15:05.668 --> 15:11.735
If we come back triumphants,
the time to marry shall come.

15:12.202 --> 15:14.335
You bear, which woman would desire you?

15:16.802 --> 15:18.635
Brothers...

15:19.202 --> 15:21.635
...you are not able to fight
from quarrelling.

15:22.635 --> 15:23.668
Come on.

15:23.802 --> 15:25.135
You do not worry, my goat.

15:25.268 --> 15:29.035
We shall level that castle
with the ground.

15:41.902 --> 15:45.202
I should not be called as a man...

15:46.102 --> 15:48.268
...if I do not turn that castle
into a dungeon for them.

15:48.335 --> 15:51.902
I shall make it a hell for them.

16:02.068 --> 16:06.168
-Come on. God is great! God is just!
-Come on, lions!

17:58.802 --> 18:00.135
How is it?

18:06.835 --> 18:10.035
You should wrap it tighter
so that when you release the arrow...

18:10.102 --> 18:12.135
...it shall pierce the knight's armor.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.935
Tighter, Dundar, tighter.

18:17.702 --> 18:19.235
Try it again.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.735
You did not get mad, did you?

18:25.635 --> 18:26.902
How can I get mad, Aykiz?

18:27.635 --> 18:29.768
Each arrow that does not pierce its target
means a martyr from our side.

18:30.135 --> 18:31.668
I shall do it immediately.

18:56.235 --> 19:03.168
My Alps, my brothers,
brave warriors of Kayi tribe.

19:05.802 --> 19:08.335
Time to stop the enemy has come.

19:10.368 --> 19:12.102
Now it is time for conquest.

19:13.635 --> 19:15.968
The enemy hides in the castle.

19:16.768 --> 19:20.335
This conquest is not a pitched battle...

19:21.102 --> 19:23.835
...we shall fight the toughest battle.

19:25.902 --> 19:30.335
If they have stone castles
we have chests full of faith.

19:31.635 --> 19:36.835
If someone should scare, flee or
break down during the battle...

19:37.168 --> 19:39.202
...they better stay home.

19:40.035 --> 19:43.835
If I see a warrior, tired of
fighting the battle...

19:44.168 --> 19:46.635
...I shall kill him with my own weapon.

19:47.968 --> 19:49.935
Now go and take your families' blessings.

19:50.622 --> 19:53.022
May God bless our way and conquest.

19:53.555 --> 19:54.955
Long live, Ertugrul Bey!

19:55.488 --> 19:56.855
Long live, Ertugrul Bey!

19:57.322 --> 19:58.722
Long live, Ertugrul Bey!

19:59.322 --> 20:00.722
Long live, Ertugrul Bey!

20:06.322 --> 20:07.322
Come on!

20:09.488 --> 20:10.555
Come on, brave men!

20:24.555 --> 20:26.322
May it be easy, may it be easy.

20:26.488 --> 20:28.322
-Thank you, Mother Hayme.
-Thank you.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.322
-Welcome.
-Welcome, Mother Hayme.

20:34.955 --> 20:37.755
Sisters, listen to me.

20:40.522 --> 20:42.322
Brave sisters of Kayi.

20:43.622 --> 20:44.988
Today is a day of unity.

20:46.322 --> 20:49.622
Today is the day we race for victory.

20:50.788 --> 20:56.022
We will supply our men until they raze
that godforsaken castel to the ground.

20:56.922 --> 21:00.522
We will work night and day.

21:01.655 --> 21:03.655
We will not falter.

21:05.388 --> 21:08.588
The battle belongs to us,
the victory is God's.

21:09.388 --> 21:10.622
Hang on, sisters.

21:11.122 --> 21:12.722
Hang on, in the name of God!

21:54.888 --> 21:56.922
-How is it going?
-It is going well, Hayme Sultan.

21:57.788 --> 21:58.955
Make them sturdy.

22:36.922 --> 22:37.988
May it be easy.

22:38.322 --> 22:39.388
Thank you, my Bey.

22:40.455 --> 22:42.422
-May it be easy, my brother.
-Thank you, brother.

22:43.355 --> 22:44.455
How are the preparations going?

22:45.655 --> 22:47.855
We removed the venom of Kurdoglu
from the hearts of our Alps, brother.

22:48.355 --> 22:50.122
-Wonderful.
-What about you?

22:50.622 --> 22:52.388
Hamza Alp checks the ammunition.

22:52.888 --> 22:56.422
I put men everywhere in case of
an attack from the outside.

22:57.322 --> 22:59.422
Anyway, I have lots of things to do.

22:59.622 --> 23:02.388
Brother, how is Selcan Hatun doing?

23:04.322 --> 23:05.522
She is no longer my wife.

23:18.322 --> 23:19.322
Thank you.

23:23.822 --> 23:24.822
Son.

23:26.388 --> 23:29.755
Me and my dervish want to be your Alps but

23:31.355 --> 23:32.988
we may do more harm than good.

23:34.455 --> 23:35.722
We expect your prayers.

23:36.088 --> 23:39.388
Of course. My prayers are always with you,
Ertugrul.

23:40.055 --> 23:41.055
Dervish.

23:47.055 --> 23:50.688
Son, one must be shielded with prayers.

23:59.322 --> 24:00.322
Thank you.

24:05.122 --> 24:07.588
Son, the situation in Anatolia
is complicated.

24:08.388 --> 24:10.955
The wild flame of Mongols is everywhere.

24:11.555 --> 24:13.355
We must not leave Anatolia
to defend itself.

24:13.955 --> 24:16.088
I came from Andalucia for Anatolia.

24:16.722 --> 24:20.555
If Anatolia prospers,
the whole Islamic World will rise.

24:22.722 --> 24:24.055
Do you suggest we go back?

24:27.855 --> 24:30.022
I say straightening the ranks
is beneficial.

24:58.955 --> 25:00.388
You seem to know what I will say.

25:02.621 --> 25:06.688
I know but my heart tears itself
to hear it.

25:12.655 --> 25:13.722
May God bless your way.

25:15.855 --> 25:17.455
May the sun never burn your skin.

25:19.122 --> 25:20.555
May no rain make you cold.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.055
May no stone get in your way.

25:25.955 --> 25:27.822
Come back to your tribe
like a flowing river.

25:31.555 --> 25:32.655
You heard it, Ak Tolgali.

25:34.422 --> 25:38.388
He will take me there and
bring me back in no time.

25:41.588 --> 25:43.822
May God help me to bring
your brother Yigit back to our tribe.

25:44.955 --> 25:46.022
If God permits.

25:49.822 --> 25:51.322
May God bless your conquest, Bey.

25:52.988 --> 25:55.122
You are going to this war as a brave Alp,

25:56.555 --> 25:58.322
but may you return as Ertugrul Alp Ghazi.

26:32.455 --> 26:33.688
Mother Hayme sent some food.

26:36.788 --> 26:37.922
Thank you, sister.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.888
Sit, eat with me.

26:41.955 --> 26:43.788
Suleyman Shah hosts a dinner
in his marquee.

26:45.922 --> 26:47.388
I will eat with them.

26:50.022 --> 26:53.022
What's the occasion?
Who is invited for the dinner?

26:55.788 --> 26:58.688
Suleyman Shah wants to see all of his
family by his side before the battle.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.055
I should go now.

27:05.755 --> 27:06.822
Enjoy the dinner.

27:26.088 --> 27:30.022
Selcan Hatun,
what goes around comes around.

27:31.422 --> 27:33.655
You reap what you sow.

27:35.422 --> 27:38.122
You are not a member
of the family anymore.

27:53.888 --> 27:58.522
My children, the future of Kayi tribe
and the hope of our people.

27:59.555 --> 28:03.722
Tonight I will tell you a story
from the land of our ancestors.

28:05.722 --> 28:10.722
Many centuries ago, our country

28:11.122 --> 28:14.655
was divided into pieces out of animosity.

28:15.522 --> 28:18.855
Our sky colored flag was abandoned.

28:19.955 --> 28:25.322
Emperors of that time ruined our country

28:26.422 --> 28:31.455
by being seduced by the silk dresses,
various gifts

28:32.722 --> 28:35.055
and mostly the Chinese women
sent by the Chinese Emperor.

28:36.488 --> 28:38.122
That enormous Turkish country collapsed

28:38.555 --> 28:43.955
and couldn't resist Chinese tricks,
various gifts

28:45.822 --> 28:46.888
and the venom of women.

28:48.488 --> 28:51.488
Our nation was taken
prisoner, my children.

28:52.688 --> 28:53.855
The captive Turks

28:55.022 --> 29:00.322
started fighting to reclaim
our sky colored flag.

29:01.022 --> 29:05.555
A brave warrior who saw his nation
being tortured under the cruelty of China

29:06.488 --> 29:09.388
took an oath of vengeance.

29:11.855 --> 29:13.388
He was Kursat, my children.

29:14.855 --> 29:15.888
Kursat!

29:19.622 --> 29:24.755
He was the nephew of the Khan
who was seduced by the silk dresses

29:25.788 --> 29:27.055
and various tricks of China.

29:29.422 --> 29:34.488
He decided to put his sword in China's
heart for the future of our nation

29:34.822 --> 29:37.655
and the sky colored flag!

29:38.855 --> 29:42.555
He choose only 40 heroes for this.

29:43.422 --> 29:45.388
Each of them was a lion.

29:45.622 --> 29:47.755
An army of believers!

29:48.055 --> 29:52.655
Every one of them was a hero, ready to
sacrifice their lives for the nation.

29:54.655 --> 29:58.022
Their target was the
cruel emperor of China.

30:00.422 --> 30:05.688
Those 40 people would get in the palace
and kill that tyrant.

30:08.822 --> 30:13.588
Even if they would fell,
the sky colored flag would be free.

30:15.555 --> 30:21.955
One night, those 40 lions
left their camp in silence.

30:23.422 --> 30:29.088
They struck the emperor's palace like
a thunder which was guarded by thousands!

30:29.622 --> 30:32.888
And they slaughtered everyone!

30:35.588 --> 30:40.022
That enormous palace was howling with
the battle cries of 40 heroes!

30:40.855 --> 30:45.722
Battle cries of 40 heroes
echoed through China!

30:49.855 --> 30:52.522
Even the Emperor had already fled

30:52.722 --> 30:55.755
when he heard the blood curdling
battle cries of 40 heroes.

30:56.922 --> 31:02.655
Kursat ordered their return, saying that
this much fear would be enough for them.

31:04.488 --> 31:09.588
But tens of thousands Chinese soldiers

31:10.655 --> 31:14.022
pursued them for their capture.

31:16.022 --> 31:19.722
When Kursat and his men came by the river

31:22.522 --> 31:26.955
it was pouring heavily.

31:28.488 --> 31:31.122
The rivers overflowed and
the bridges fell down.

31:32.355 --> 31:36.422
Kursat and his heroes were trapped.
Unable to cross the river,

31:37.055 --> 31:43.422
they bid farewell to their brothers in
arms and charged into the fray.

31:43.822 --> 31:46.588
And reaped the Chinese like wheat!

31:48.988 --> 31:54.688
But the Chinese were endless
and sent them to the afterlife.

31:56.355 --> 31:59.988
They died for the sky colored flag
and for freedom.

32:02.755 --> 32:09.022
My children, Kursat and his heroes
made history when they died.

32:10.988 --> 32:16.422
Their legend spread quickly.

32:16.922 --> 32:22.588
Kursat paved the way of the Turks
with his actions and a nation was reborn.

32:23.788 --> 32:25.788
They broke the shackles of China's fear

32:26.688 --> 32:28.922
and returned to the stage of history.

32:30.655 --> 32:36.455
This saga of independence
is Kusat's legacy to us.

32:39.488 --> 32:40.622
May God never leave us again

32:41.822 --> 32:45.455
without the voice of Azan,

32:48.355 --> 32:51.755
our flag and our country.

32:52.055 --> 32:53.722
-Amen.
-Amen.

32:55.622 --> 32:59.622
And may he never let this nation
to be imprisoned again.

33:00.455 --> 33:01.888
-Amen.
-Amen.

33:06.122 --> 33:08.855
Amen, my children. Amen.

33:37.755 --> 33:38.955
What is missing?

34:10.055 --> 34:11.788
Go to hell, Selcan.

34:13.622 --> 34:14.755
I will not be defeated by you!

34:25.422 --> 34:26.455
May I come in, Bey?

34:30.388 --> 34:32.522
Come in, Hamza. Come in.

34:38.788 --> 34:40.688
Suleyman Shah expects you for dinner, Bey.

34:44.088 --> 34:45.855
Thank you.

35:27.555 --> 35:30.622
I worked all day but
this was all I could prepare.

35:31.322 --> 35:32.522
I hope you like it.

35:33.755 --> 35:34.855
Let us try, Hatun.

35:41.455 --> 35:44.055
Let us see if you did well.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.488
Turgut.

35:57.788 --> 35:59.455
Turgut, what is it?
-Give me water.

36:17.988 --> 36:19.055
Aykiz, what is this?

36:20.022 --> 36:21.088
What is what?

36:21.722 --> 36:22.888
Did not you like it?

36:23.488 --> 36:25.555
Even The Templars did not torture me
like this.

36:26.455 --> 36:28.455
Even the poison they fed me
tasted better.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.388
Is that so?

36:33.088 --> 36:34.755
Go and drink their poison then.

36:37.022 --> 36:40.688
Wait, wait. Sit down, I was jesting.

36:48.755 --> 36:49.922
It was a jest.

36:50.822 --> 36:51.955
You don't say.

36:57.088 --> 36:58.955
Aykiz, sweeter than the moon itself.

37:03.855 --> 37:07.455
How can these blessed hands
feed me poison?

37:09.022 --> 37:10.588
It is so delicious

37:11.055 --> 37:15.888
that I have never tasted anything
more halal, more delicious my life.

37:17.855 --> 37:19.655
How do I know that you are
telling the truth?

37:20.388 --> 37:22.022
I swear, Aykiz, it is very good.

37:26.988 --> 37:27.988
Okay, stop.

37:28.655 --> 37:29.988
Okay, you will choke on it.

37:36.022 --> 37:37.755
I was so scared, Turgut.

37:39.122 --> 37:43.855
I would never forgive my hands
if they prepare something

37:44.988 --> 37:46.388
you won't like someday.

37:55.922 --> 37:59.722
Tomorrow, we are going to bring
that castle to the ground.

38:03.355 --> 38:07.922
If I become a martyr,
you will not shed tears.

38:08.922 --> 38:09.988
Promise me.

38:12.088 --> 38:13.555
If you become a martyr

38:15.022 --> 38:16.722
know that I will not shed any tears.

38:18.488 --> 38:21.955
I shall praise God
for giving us the honor.

38:43.055 --> 38:45.488
-How are the preparations going?
-We are ready, Bey.

38:45.755 --> 38:46.822
We are ready, Bey.

38:48.055 --> 38:50.688
Let us see how will that castle
endure our weapons.

38:59.655 --> 39:01.922
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

39:02.322 --> 39:03.855
And peace be upon you. Come in.

39:04.588 --> 39:05.622
Thank you.

39:09.855 --> 39:13.655
We could not show you the hospitality
you deserve because of all the troubles.

39:14.322 --> 39:17.822
You have accepted me to your tent,
tribe and heart, Suleyman Shah.

39:18.455 --> 39:19.588
I need nothing more.

39:20.355 --> 39:21.655
Thank you.

39:22.822 --> 39:24.988
Tomorrow is the day of our holy conquest.

39:26.655 --> 39:27.655
Yes, it is.

39:29.322 --> 39:33.822
We will do battle in order to stop cruelty

39:34.855 --> 39:36.322
and show our strenght to the tyrants.

39:37.055 --> 39:41.088
May God grant Kayi tribe strengt to do
holy conquest until the eternity.

39:41.722 --> 39:42.855
-Amen.
-Amen.

39:43.488 --> 39:44.522
Amen.

39:44.855 --> 39:50.088
May your tribe reign supreme

39:50.622 --> 39:53.922
and show the tyrants the power of justice.

39:54.822 --> 39:56.355
-Amen.
-Amen.

39:58.588 --> 40:00.588
Bey, the dinner is ready.

40:06.055 --> 40:07.055
Let us eat.

40:28.088 --> 40:29.455
In the name of God.

40:30.522 --> 40:31.555
Enjoy your meal.

41:05.722 --> 41:06.822
The war begins now.

41:35.088 --> 41:36.488
Don't get too excited now.

41:37.522 --> 41:38.822
Or I will cut you down.

41:46.522 --> 41:47.522
Come here.

41:54.322 --> 41:55.455
Tell Titus that Ertugrul

41:55.922 --> 41:58.555
he was looking all over,
has come to raze his castle down.

42:00.655 --> 42:03.655
And tell him that,
Suleyman Shah wants to talk to him

42:04.388 --> 42:06.555
and give him a chance and only once

42:08.322 --> 42:09.622
to ask for mercy.

42:10.922 --> 42:12.055
We are waiting for him here.

42:13.355 --> 42:14.355
Hurry up.

42:28.722 --> 42:29.922
What do we do about these heathens, Bey?

42:31.422 --> 42:32.822
Keep them somewhere for now, Turgut.

43:21.388 --> 43:23.022
Titus!

44:11.688 --> 44:16.688
May God's light and Templar's faith
illuminate your path.

45:06.455 --> 45:08.622
Kayi tribe blocked the roads
to the castle, sir.

45:09.455 --> 45:11.422
They are locking us in.
-What?

45:12.088 --> 45:15.388
Their Bey is in front of the castle,
he wants to negotiate with you.

45:26.022 --> 45:29.488
Are you not going to tell us
what is happening, Master Titus?

45:38.688 --> 45:40.722
Kayi tribe blocaded the castle, sir.

45:52.855 --> 45:55.122
Double, no, triple the guards.

45:55.622 --> 45:56.888
Make night's watch more frequent too.

45:57.388 --> 46:00.555
Strengthen the portcullis, increase
the number of archers too.

46:04.422 --> 46:05.688
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!

46:07.655 --> 46:12.055
I was coming to congratulate you
for your new holy duty, sir.

46:13.388 --> 46:15.488
This is too early for this, Claudius,
too early.

46:18.088 --> 46:20.588
-Is something wrong, sir?
-Come with me, Claudius.

46:33.455 --> 46:36.555
Soldiers, secure the gates, quickly!

46:38.122 --> 46:41.455
Swords, shields, spears,
get all the equipment out!

46:42.322 --> 46:43.388
What is going on?

46:44.755 --> 46:47.888
Ertugrul surrounded the castle with
Kayi tribe.

46:50.322 --> 46:51.622
How dare him?

46:52.388 --> 46:54.522
They will pay the price of their bravery.

46:56.888 --> 46:58.522
Alert everyone immediately, at once!

47:56.122 --> 47:57.422
What are you thinking?

47:57.855 --> 48:01.622
They attacked us first when we were
planning to attack them.

48:03.355 --> 48:06.022
They must have found out about the
decision that we made in the council

48:06.388 --> 48:08.822
that we were going to attack them
together with Principality of Antioch

48:09.055 --> 48:10.488
and the Knights of Cyprus.

48:12.555 --> 48:17.322
Apart from the masters, only the cardinal,
you and I knew about this.

48:18.355 --> 48:21.688
Yes. We shall find out
who else knows soon.

48:26.055 --> 48:27.988
It is impossible for us to have
an infiltrator among us.

48:31.955 --> 48:33.488
I hope you are right, Claudius.

48:34.755 --> 48:36.788
If they really have
an infiltrator inside...

48:39.022 --> 48:43.655
...they are the cat and we are
the mouse in this game.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.322
They are not capable of such a thing.

48:48.622 --> 48:50.922
They managed infiltrate us before.

48:51.588 --> 48:55.055
That Afsin and the Muslim spy
dressed as a priest.

48:56.422 --> 48:58.022
I can expect everything from them now.

49:00.422 --> 49:01.622
Strengthen the walls.

49:02.122 --> 49:05.022
Put more men on the weak spots.
Come on, hurry up.

49:06.122 --> 49:07.522
As you command, sir.

49:12.422 --> 49:14.588
Come on, hurry up and
put your backs into it!

49:46.455 --> 49:48.322
The Templars were not expecting us.

49:49.788 --> 49:51.488
They must be losing their mind now.

49:52.622 --> 49:54.988
We have come to teach them
how to fight, son.

49:56.455 --> 49:58.688
They have tried many things.

50:00.822 --> 50:03.522
They wanted us and here we are.

50:04.755 --> 50:08.322
May we never go back to our tribe if we
fail to plant our flag on these walls.

50:17.388 --> 50:19.888
Do not deem him as an equal
by negotiating, sir.

50:20.455 --> 50:23.955
Maybe the best course of action is
a sudden raid. A break-out.

50:24.522 --> 50:25.788
They have the upper hand.

50:26.788 --> 50:28.622
Their numbers are at least
three times more.

50:29.055 --> 50:31.055
Out horses are in the studs
outside of the castle.

50:31.822 --> 50:33.422
They must have seized them too.

50:34.888 --> 50:36.355
We are trapped.

50:37.588 --> 50:38.755
They cannot get in the castle.

50:39.655 --> 50:41.622
They cannot get in but they would
not let us out too.

50:45.422 --> 50:50.422
We can finish them right here with
the army that is coming to our aid.

50:51.021 --> 50:53.922
The pigeon should reach the
Principality of Antioch before noon.

50:54.855 --> 50:56.688
The army will be here within two days.

50:58.622 --> 51:00.455
You will negotiate with him then.

51:01.555 --> 51:04.455
Yes. Let us find out
what their trouble is.

51:05.355 --> 51:06.755
You come with me, Claudius.

51:08.021 --> 51:09.088
Prepare the horses.

52:17.888 --> 52:20.788
I give you until tonight
to surrender Titus.

52:25.088 --> 52:27.122
What if we do not surrender, Suleyman?

52:28.888 --> 52:33.122
Then we will kill every single one of you
and burn your castle to the ground.

52:46.022 --> 52:48.355
Is this how strong
the goat shepherds have become?

52:50.422 --> 52:51.988
You did not need to bother.

52:53.422 --> 52:55.788
I was on my way to your tribe
to obliterate you.

52:58.622 --> 53:00.888
I hope you know how to use a blade as much
as your tongue, Titus.

53:01.988 --> 53:06.755
I would hate to see my Alps to be here for
mere training.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.522
Why did you want to talk to me then?

53:13.522 --> 53:15.722
Here is the castle,
why have you not attacked?

53:16.355 --> 53:20.988
We Muslims show mercy for one last time
even for the heathens we fight.

53:22.088 --> 53:25.388
So that they might find the true path.

53:27.722 --> 53:30.655
Now, I ask you for one last time.

53:31.888 --> 53:32.955
Surrender the castle.

53:35.055 --> 53:37.488
Surrender your weapons with your soldiers

53:38.022 --> 53:39.622
and go back to the lands you came from.

53:40.955 --> 53:42.888
And your lives shall be spared.

53:44.455 --> 53:46.488
You do not know The Templars at all.

53:49.355 --> 53:50.488
We die...

53:52.488 --> 53:53.888
...but we never surrender.

53:56.755 --> 53:58.655
Come and capture my castle if you can.

54:11.422 --> 54:12.588
Time is up, Titus!

54:15.755 --> 54:16.822
You are going to die.

54:40.488 --> 54:41.488
Here you go.

54:58.088 --> 55:00.855
Mother, do I have your permission?

55:03.655 --> 55:04.788
Yes, Selcan Hatun.

55:07.088 --> 55:11.355
I am ashamed of sitting in the tent
while our men are fighting the enemy.

55:12.722 --> 55:16.022
I want to help my sisters
with your permission.

55:20.388 --> 55:21.388
Come and join us.

55:22.855 --> 55:23.855
Come on.

55:34.955 --> 55:36.922
May it be easy, sisters. May it be easy.

55:38.922 --> 55:41.622
Mother, our preparations are completed.

55:42.088 --> 55:44.788
If you are done here too, we may go now.

55:47.688 --> 55:48.755
What is she doing here?

55:51.988 --> 55:55.088
She said that she does not want to sit
in her tent while the men are fighting.

55:57.455 --> 55:58.488
And I let her.

56:01.555 --> 56:02.555
Selcan.

56:04.755 --> 56:05.822
Leave immediately.

56:25.688 --> 56:29.322
Get your filthy hands off of us
and leave.

56:30.888 --> 56:32.622
-Gundogdu.
-I said now.

56:55.655 --> 56:57.955
If you had let me handle Selcan before

56:59.322 --> 57:01.055
none of this would have happened.

57:02.755 --> 57:04.388
I would have set her straight.

57:39.488 --> 57:43.455
Hugues de Payens, Godfrey de Saint-Omer.

57:44.855 --> 57:47.055
The king of Jerusalem, Baldwin the second.

57:48.755 --> 57:50.988
They have opened us this honorable path.

57:52.388 --> 57:56.355
Our campaign started to defend
Christian pilgrims

57:57.488 --> 58:00.888
but it will end today with the
conquest of Jerusalem.

58:03.855 --> 58:06.122
Every single one of you

58:07.855 --> 58:09.988
is a holy warrior of God.

58:11.655 --> 58:12.955
We shall reclaim

58:13.722 --> 58:19.122
Solomon's Temple in the Mount of Olives
next to Al-Aqsa Mosque.

58:22.588 --> 58:24.588
Nothing can prevent this.

58:26.422 --> 58:31.322
You are the followers of Jesus
and Solomon's Temple.

58:33.355 --> 58:35.088
The time has come to teach

58:36.688 --> 58:38.522
those heretical

58:40.088 --> 58:42.622
and heathen Turks a lesson.

58:44.722 --> 58:46.122
Jesus is by our side.

58:49.022 --> 58:50.488
May God protect you.

59:00.355 --> 59:01.688
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:02.522 --> 59:03.955
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:04.388 --> 59:05.822
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:06.422 --> 59:07.922
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:08.322 --> 59:09.722
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:10.355 --> 59:11.788
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:12.055 --> 59:13.655
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:14.055 --> 59:15.555
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:15.888 --> 59:17.488
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:17.955 --> 59:19.555
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:19.822 --> 59:21.422
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:21.755 --> 59:23.355
Victory belongs to the lord!

59:23.655 --> 59:25.122
Victory belongs to the lord!

01:00:12.532 --> 01:00:14.766
There is no other explanation
for this, Cardinal.

01:00:16.166 --> 01:00:18.099
They are not fool enough to just walk into

01:00:18.799 --> 01:00:22.132
a castle protected like Alamut.

01:00:24.566 --> 01:00:25.866
What do you have in mind, Titus?

01:00:30.299 --> 01:00:31.699
We must have a spy among us.

01:00:44.499 --> 01:00:46.299
You reap what you sow,
don't you agree, Titus?

01:00:47.266 --> 01:00:50.199
We had spies among Eyyubis once.

01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:53.099
Eftelya. Nasir.

01:00:53.766 --> 01:00:56.132
Among Seljuks, Karatoygar.

01:00:57.066 --> 01:00:59.699
And among the Kayi tribe, Kurdoglu.

01:01:01.832 --> 01:01:06.366
Now they have prevailed
to seed spies among us.

01:01:06.766 --> 01:01:07.832
How peculiar!

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.666
Look at this goat smelled shepherd tribe.

01:01:13.532 --> 01:01:16.099
I shall find that spy no matter what.

01:01:16.866 --> 01:01:18.566
The members of the council are tense.

01:01:19.599 --> 01:01:22.266
They don't want to pay the price
for Master Petruccio's mistakes.

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:24.232
If this castle falls

01:01:25.499 --> 01:01:27.366
the Crusades shall be endangered.

01:01:28.066 --> 01:01:29.232
It will be much worse, Titus.

01:01:29.799 --> 01:01:31.299
If what you say is true

01:01:32.366 --> 01:01:34.466
heretics who wants to make
a deal with muslims will win

01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:37.466
instead of crushing them.

01:01:38.432 --> 01:01:40.399
That is when the real disaster
shall begin.

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:46.566
We have a big opportunity to dispose of
Turks once and for all, Cardinal.

01:01:48.566 --> 01:01:52.499
I shall make use of this opportunity
that is handed to me in a golden plate.

01:02:11.799 --> 01:02:13.632
Belt and braces, Cladius.

01:02:14.366 --> 01:02:15.699
If the situation deteriorates

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:19.299
we must find a way to save ourselves
from this accursed place.

01:02:21.099 --> 01:02:22.299
Do not be concerned, sir.

01:02:35.466 --> 01:02:37.866
Only your corpse shall leave
this place, you bastard.

01:02:53.566 --> 01:02:55.466
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:02:57.166 --> 01:02:59.066
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:02:59.766 --> 01:03:01.199
What is the situation, Wild Demir?

01:03:01.832 --> 01:03:06.132
Bey, the tunnels of the castle have proven
to be more arduous than we deemed.

01:03:07.566 --> 01:03:08.832
Can't we break through, Wild Demir?

01:03:09.499 --> 01:03:13.266
We can, my Bey, but we need more men.

01:03:14.432 --> 01:03:18.499
And the noise shall be noticed
by the heathens.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:23.666
Is there any other way, Wild Demir?

01:03:28.532 --> 01:03:29.832
Then our task is even more compelling.

01:03:32.132 --> 01:03:33.566
We now need to find the second tunnel.

01:03:36.166 --> 01:03:38.666
Wild Demir, put your backs into it.

01:03:39.366 --> 01:03:44.099
Break the stones with your weapons
if you have to but get into that castle.

01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:47.599
As you command, my Bey. As you command.

01:04:09.399 --> 01:04:12.466
If all of your signatures should be
on the letter I drafted

01:04:13.232 --> 01:04:16.266
the number of soldiers coming
to our aid will be much greater.

01:04:17.332 --> 01:04:20.866
Not even a single Turk
will be left alive on this land.

01:04:23.732 --> 01:04:25.732
What if the Turks should enter the castle?

01:04:26.832 --> 01:04:28.532
That is not possible, Master Ricardo.

01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:31.666
They have neither the equipment
to breach the walls

01:04:32.699 --> 01:04:35.366
nor the technique to approach portcullis.

01:04:36.799 --> 01:04:39.399
Remember that they are mere shepherds.

01:04:40.699 --> 01:04:45.832
Are you proposing that the Alps
and their Beys are fools, Titus?

01:04:47.199 --> 01:04:49.866
I don't suppose they are here for
pleasure with so many warriors.

01:04:51.532 --> 01:04:54.332
Masters, my name is Titus.

01:04:55.832 --> 01:04:58.299
I will discover whatever
these rancid shepherds' plans are

01:04:59.799 --> 01:05:03.266
and whoever their spies are hiding.

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.466
Do not have any doubts about this.

01:05:08.766 --> 01:05:12.199
When this letter reaches
the County of Crusaders

01:05:12.766 --> 01:05:14.599
everything will come to an end for them.

01:05:16.199 --> 01:05:17.532
By signing this letter here

01:05:19.199 --> 01:05:21.432
you shall be signing the
death warrant of Turks.

01:07:03.799 --> 01:07:05.666
Who are you? What is your business here?

01:07:06.232 --> 01:07:09.566
-I am Cardinal Thomas' knight, Cladius.
-What do you want?

01:07:10.499 --> 01:07:13.832
There is a letter that must reach
the Church of Antioch.

01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:16.366
It is the Cardinal's orders.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:20.799
Without Master Titus' consent, I cannot
send any pigeons anywhere, knight Cladius.

01:07:21.632 --> 01:07:22.632
You must excuse me.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:26.166
I see.

01:07:57.832 --> 01:07:58.832
Fly away now.

01:07:59.799 --> 01:08:02.099
And send Ertugrul Bey my regards.

01:08:42.632 --> 01:08:43.799
Omer has done his duty.

01:08:45.299 --> 01:08:46.299
Now it is our turn.

01:08:48.266 --> 01:08:50.632
Double the patrols and guards, Ertugrul.

01:08:52.366 --> 01:08:55.266
They would do anything to send word
from the castle now.

01:08:59.466 --> 01:09:03.366
If Omer cannot stop the messenger
of Titus, we must do so.

01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:48.066
It's tip is bloody.

01:09:49.499 --> 01:09:51.332
The murderer has tried to wipe it
but it' still bloody.

01:09:53.266 --> 01:09:55.732
-So?
-So, the spy must be wounded.

01:09:57.699 --> 01:09:59.199
He had wounded him before he died.

01:10:05.366 --> 01:10:08.399
Inspect everyone
and bring me every wounded man.

01:10:08.732 --> 01:10:09.799
As you command, sir.

01:10:10.266 --> 01:10:12.732
Cladius, you inspect the Cardinal's men.

01:10:13.232 --> 01:10:16.632
There would not be any spies
among the Cardinal's men, sir.

01:10:17.332 --> 01:10:18.699
You will do as I command.

01:10:20.266 --> 01:10:22.332
As you command, Master Titus.

01:10:32.432 --> 01:10:35.566
God damned Turks, you all belong to hell.

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:38.432
All of you will die.

01:10:42.699 --> 01:10:45.599
At least now we have comfirmed
that we have a spy in the castle.

01:10:48.132 --> 01:10:49.199
What do we do now, sir?

01:10:49.866 --> 01:10:52.199
We must send another messenger
to the Crusaders.

01:10:55.366 --> 01:10:57.599
-There is a secret passage.
-A passage?

01:11:01.099 --> 01:11:02.666
Yes, there are two tunnels.

01:11:04.632 --> 01:11:06.499
Master Petruccio sealed the first one.

01:11:08.232 --> 01:11:10.199
And only the two of us knew
the whereabouts of the second.

01:11:11.766 --> 01:11:14.499
I could fulfil this difficult task
if you command me.

01:11:16.366 --> 01:11:19.132
No, I need you more in here.

01:11:21.232 --> 01:11:22.432
As you wish, sir.

01:12:02.199 --> 01:12:04.366
Father said that he will hold yours and
Aunt Halime's wedding together.

01:12:06.466 --> 01:12:08.366
Let us bring down the castle upon
the heathens first.

01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:13.199
We shall see your wedding too,
in the future, if God permits.

01:12:14.766 --> 01:12:16.299
I shall be like brother Bamsi.

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:19.299
I will take my weapon as my bride
and my horse as my child.

01:12:20.199 --> 01:12:23.066
If God permits, I shall be a great Alp,
just as brother Ertugrul and Turgut.

01:12:24.432 --> 01:12:26.599
When will you go to the mountains
for your Alp training?

01:12:28.266 --> 01:12:30.499
As soon as he takes Yigit from the castle,
father will send us to the mountains.

01:12:31.399 --> 01:12:34.266
Our training will begin then.
-If God permits.

01:12:35.532 --> 01:12:37.799
If God permits, I will have
brave sons as you are.

01:12:38.666 --> 01:12:39.666
If God permits.

01:13:04.866 --> 01:13:08.266
Sisters! These supplies shall be
on their way in the morning.

01:13:08.532 --> 01:13:10.132
Just hang in there!

01:13:18.666 --> 01:13:19.866
Mother! Mother!

01:13:20.732 --> 01:13:22.132
Sisters bring some water, quickly!

01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:25.199
Come. Sit down, mother. Sit down.

01:13:39.399 --> 01:13:40.432
Thank you, my daughter.

01:13:41.132 --> 01:13:44.599
I am alright, no need to be concerned.
I only felt a bit dizzy.

01:13:45.066 --> 01:13:49.366
Mother, you should rest.
We will ready the supplies in time.

01:13:50.632 --> 01:13:54.099
I know how capable you all are.

01:13:56.232 --> 01:14:02.866
Year ago, my father was the commander
of a castle in our ancestral lands.

01:14:04.132 --> 01:14:09.166
He fought hard to protect our castle
from the Mongols.

01:14:10.599 --> 01:14:13.466
My brothers became martyrs in that battle.

01:14:17.466 --> 01:14:21.699
But we did not let a single Mongol
enter our castle.

01:14:23.432 --> 01:14:26.732
Which of our men will become martyrs now?

01:14:29.099 --> 01:14:34.566
That is why we must make our tribe ready
after the battle.

01:14:35.832 --> 01:14:41.099
We will share the burden of our martyrs'

01:14:41.766 --> 01:14:47.299
mothers, sons, sisters and wives.

01:14:50.732 --> 01:14:55.532
And then there is Sungurtekin
whom I could not even see his dead body.

01:15:01.099 --> 01:15:05.132
My heart says that he is not dead

01:15:07.066 --> 01:15:09.166
and we will reunite someday.

01:15:10.599 --> 01:15:11.732
If God permits, mother.

01:15:13.066 --> 01:15:14.632
You will reunite, if God permits.

01:15:16.832 --> 01:15:19.699
If God permits, my daughter.
If God permits.

01:15:25.666 --> 01:15:26.832
Where is Selcan?

01:15:29.799 --> 01:15:34.099
Gundogdu Bey told her not to leave
the tent, so she does not, mother.

01:15:35.866 --> 01:15:38.666
I will see how she is doing.

01:15:39.199 --> 01:15:40.266
Come, mother.

01:15:40.432 --> 01:15:41.832
I can stand up.

01:15:46.599 --> 01:15:47.632
Thank you.

01:16:22.566 --> 01:16:25.566
My God, forgive me.

01:16:27.266 --> 01:16:28.766
Forgive me first

01:16:29.799 --> 01:16:32.499
so that your subjects
may share your mercy.

01:16:34.199 --> 01:16:37.499
Let a drop of your mercy
fall in their hearts.

01:16:39.366 --> 01:16:40.432
Amen.

01:16:52.466 --> 01:16:53.532
May God accept your prayers.

01:16:54.766 --> 01:16:55.832
Thank you, mother.

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:00.766
I thought I should check on you.

01:17:06.132 --> 01:17:07.266
Thank you so much, mother.

01:17:09.132 --> 01:17:10.466
Come, please sit down.

01:17:38.332 --> 01:17:39.366
Selcan.

01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:43.532
This tribe has been through so much.

01:17:45.632 --> 01:17:47.232
Repelled so many enemies.

01:17:49.399 --> 01:17:50.799
But none of them

01:17:52.499 --> 01:17:54.766
hurt us as much as what you have done.

01:17:58.566 --> 01:18:03.199
Thence, you should not expect people
to forgive you any time soon.

01:18:06.332 --> 01:18:09.566
Whatever I say would be in vain, mother.
You are right.

01:18:12.766 --> 01:18:13.832
But...

01:18:15.866 --> 01:18:18.332
...what worries me the most is Gundogdu.

01:18:21.766 --> 01:18:23.099
Will he marry?

01:18:25.499 --> 01:18:26.766
Will he divorce me, mother?

01:18:32.332 --> 01:18:34.166
If he does so,
send me away from the tribe.

01:18:36.466 --> 01:18:40.399
From now on, it is Gundogdu's decision.

01:18:42.466 --> 01:18:43.799
Do not expect anything from us.

01:18:51.766 --> 01:18:52.832
Selcan, my daughter!

01:18:58.666 --> 01:18:59.699
Are you alright?

01:19:00.499 --> 01:19:01.532
I do not know, mother.

01:19:07.732 --> 01:19:09.732
I hope I am not with child, mother.

01:19:43.432 --> 01:19:44.499
What is it, father?

01:19:47.432 --> 01:19:52.799
We came here to spare our Alps
at the base camp from sorrow, my son.

01:20:19.832 --> 01:20:20.832
Father?

01:20:25.832 --> 01:20:27.199
You should not have come like this.

01:20:28.766 --> 01:20:33.366
If the Alps aren't led by a Bey
willing to be martyred

01:20:34.666 --> 01:20:36.866
the battle would be fought in vain,
my son.

01:20:42.466 --> 01:20:46.099
Besides, isn't it fate
what protects one from his death?

01:21:21.632 --> 01:21:24.866
Look for any sleeping guards,
these Turks are unpredictable.

01:21:25.232 --> 01:21:26.599
As you command, knight Cladius.

01:21:49.399 --> 01:21:53.332
Ertugrul Bey, Omer is giving us the sign.

01:22:09.532 --> 01:22:10.799
They are sending a messenger
from the castle.

01:22:13.066 --> 01:22:16.132
Turgut, tell the Alps
to keep their eyes peeled.

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:20.366
Even if an ant leaves that castle
you will bring it to me.

01:22:21.332 --> 01:22:22.466
As you command, my Bey.

01:22:49.799 --> 01:22:52.332
What are you up to, Cladius?

01:23:13.766 --> 01:23:16.132
We must stop Titus' messengers
at all costs.

01:23:17.499 --> 01:23:19.332
I desire to fulfil this task,
with your permission.

01:23:20.566 --> 01:23:22.066
Go at once, son.

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:25.866
Turgut, prepare the horses.

01:23:27.666 --> 01:23:29.466
We will be moving.
-As you command, Bey.

01:23:58.632 --> 01:24:00.332
I thought I should check the premises.

01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:08.732
These Turks are desperate enough to
climb up the walls.

01:24:13.066 --> 01:24:15.066
It would be better if I get some sleep.

01:24:16.432 --> 01:24:17.599
Good night to you, sir.

01:24:19.232 --> 01:24:20.332
And to you.

01:24:28.366 --> 01:24:29.466
Cladius.

01:25:50.532 --> 01:25:53.532
Bey, what if those wretches
have managed to escape?

01:25:55.466 --> 01:25:58.132
They are without horses, Bamsi.
They cannot get too far.

01:26:25.432 --> 01:26:26.432
This way.

01:27:30.566 --> 01:27:33.866
<i>Your success of being a disciple of Arabi</i>
 <i>will open many doors</i>

01:27:34.232 --> 01:27:36.399
<i>for our fight against the Islamic world.</i>

01:27:37.099 --> 01:27:38.332
<i>We are not rivals anymore.</i>

01:27:42.432 --> 01:27:43.766
<i>I thought I should check the premises.</i>

01:28:31.332 --> 01:28:33.199
Have you been wounded by this dagger,
Cladius?

01:28:37.532 --> 01:28:38.866
The dagger you killed my knight with.

01:28:52.799 --> 01:28:55.266
Why did you do this? Why?

01:28:56.699 --> 01:28:59.732
There is no deity but God and
Mohammad is His prophet and subject.

01:29:58.232 --> 01:30:00.166
Hamza, how are we standing?

01:30:00.566 --> 01:30:04.499
Armors, quivers, ropes and swords
are all ready, Bey.

01:30:05.599 --> 01:30:08.366
We loaded them all and lack nothing.

01:30:08.599 --> 01:30:09.699
Great!

01:30:10.199 --> 01:30:11.866
Thence, we will be on our way.

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:17.232
So that we can share in the glory of
this holy conquest.

01:30:17.832 --> 01:30:19.099
Move along, cartwright!

01:30:19.866 --> 01:30:21.699
Come on Alps, in the name of God!

01:30:22.132 --> 01:30:23.466
Come on, in the name of God!

01:30:28.166 --> 01:30:29.166
Gundogdu Bey!

01:30:32.199 --> 01:30:33.266
What do you want, Selcan?

01:30:40.332 --> 01:30:41.432
You are going to battle.

01:30:43.066 --> 01:30:46.499
You may never return or find me if you do.

01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:53.332
I wanted to see you one last time,
before you go.

01:30:55.799 --> 01:30:57.599
You have crushed my beating heart, Selcan.

01:30:59.832 --> 01:31:01.699
I didn't do anything to
deserve all this.

01:31:03.866 --> 01:31:05.666
I have nothing more to say to you.

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:12.466
Have mercy, Gundogdu.

01:31:13.732 --> 01:31:14.832
Mercy.

01:31:24.732 --> 01:31:25.732
Selcan.

01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:28.699
I kneel before you.

01:31:30.532 --> 01:31:33.699
I disregarded my honor, I beg you.

01:31:35.432 --> 01:31:37.499
Please forgive me.

01:31:39.566 --> 01:31:40.599
Selcan!

01:31:45.532 --> 01:31:47.066
It is over, understand this.

01:31:49.399 --> 01:31:51.499
If I become a martyr in the battle

01:31:52.599 --> 01:31:53.866
I give you my blessing.

01:31:59.132 --> 01:32:00.166
Farewell.

01:33:19.832 --> 01:33:20.832
Come on!

01:34:02.166 --> 01:34:03.166
Turgut.

01:34:04.599 --> 01:34:05.666
Search this one.

01:34:18.566 --> 01:34:19.666
We have found the letter!

01:34:24.799 --> 01:34:25.832
Come on, we are leaving.

01:34:42.766 --> 01:34:44.366
Cladius! Cladius!

01:34:45.732 --> 01:34:46.766
Damned man!

01:34:52.132 --> 01:34:55.132
If Ertugrul knows where
the sealed tunnel is

01:34:56.432 --> 01:34:58.166
it must be Isadora who informed him.

01:34:58.366 --> 01:35:00.699
Then he is aware of the second tunnel.

01:35:02.332 --> 01:35:04.066
Only I knew where that tunnel is.

01:35:05.099 --> 01:35:07.299
It isn't possible for Cladius
to reveal it's location.

01:35:07.866 --> 01:35:09.832
We cannot be sure
of anything anymore, Titus.

01:35:11.066 --> 01:35:14.532
If your messenger can not reach
the County of Antioch

01:35:16.132 --> 01:35:17.566
we will all die in here.

01:35:20.499 --> 01:35:21.832
I shall leave with Yigit, right away.

01:35:22.432 --> 01:35:24.166
You cannot get out of this siege alive.

01:35:24.632 --> 01:35:25.766
Besides you don't have a horse.

01:35:34.299 --> 01:35:35.332
I will take my chances.

01:35:37.532 --> 01:35:39.066
Are you that much afraid Cardinal?

01:35:40.099 --> 01:35:41.432
Jesus shall protect us.

01:35:42.699 --> 01:35:45.566
I cannot leave it to Jesus, Titus.

01:35:47.699 --> 01:35:50.366
He seems too busy with fools like you.

01:35:53.199 --> 01:35:54.266
As you wish.

01:35:54.866 --> 01:35:56.699
If you want to leave so much...

01:36:23.799 --> 01:36:26.266
Sir, Ertugrul is approacing the castle
with three of his Alps.

01:36:35.499 --> 01:36:37.499
Send the knights to the
sealed tunnel immediately.

01:36:38.499 --> 01:36:41.099
Turks may try to get in through there.
-As you command, sir.

01:36:53.466 --> 01:36:56.632
A single Turk outsmarted all of you.

01:36:57.699 --> 01:36:58.766
Incompetent fools!

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:53.666
What do you want, Turk?

01:37:57.499 --> 01:37:59.832
I brought back the letter
you sent to the Crusaders.

01:38:07.332 --> 01:38:08.699
You will not survive this, Titus.

01:38:09.799 --> 01:38:10.832
There is no escape.

01:38:12.599 --> 01:38:14.732
Those walls will be your gravestones.

01:39:02.573 --> 01:39:03.940
This is my present for you, Turk.

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:08.273
You may bury your first carcass.

01:39:13.573 --> 01:39:15.540
Then I willl bury you one by one.

01:39:16.973 --> 01:39:19.407
Now take your erratic renegade and go back
to hell where you came from.

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.940
I swear to God I shall kill you, Titus.

01:39:23.973 --> 01:39:25.840
I shall not let you die on your own!

01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:29.807
Your brother Dundar also said the same.

01:39:31.307 --> 01:39:32.740
And you know what happened to him.

01:39:33.407 --> 01:39:34.807
Dundar has healed, you ignoble!

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:39.873
You are inglorious enough to try to kill
a little boy

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:42.607
and incapable enough to succeed in that.

01:39:43.973 --> 01:39:46.573
I will make you pay
for what you have done.

01:40:53.307 --> 01:40:54.507
Inform Ertugrul Bey.

01:40:55.973 --> 01:40:57.007
The castle is ready.

01:41:02.207 --> 01:41:03.240
Someone is approaching!

01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:55.340
Remove the bodies.

01:42:29.573 --> 01:42:30.840
Kill him if he makes any trouble.

01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:33.440
We have much to travel yet.

01:42:35.273 --> 01:42:36.507
I cannot deal with this kid.

01:43:09.207 --> 01:43:10.207
With the name of God.

01:43:35.373 --> 01:43:36.440
Great God!

01:44:00.607 --> 01:44:02.740
Great God! With the name of God!

01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:51.340
We cannot reach the base camp in time
at this pace, my Bey.

01:47:52.973 --> 01:47:55.840
The rest of the road is inclined,
the wagon should go faster.

01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:00.273
We cannot leave our Alps without
water and bread or supplies.

01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:56.940
Isn't this Shahzada Yigit's belt, my Bey?

01:48:58.007 --> 01:48:59.573
-Are you certain?
-I am, my Bey.

01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:02.473
It is as if he left us a trail on purpose.

01:49:05.273 --> 01:49:06.740
Was not the Shahzada a prisoner
in the castle?

01:49:07.907 --> 01:49:09.940
Someone may want to smuggle the Shahzada.

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:25.273
These tracks are fresh.

01:49:26.673 --> 01:49:29.707
They are five or six people.
They had gone that way.

01:49:31.673 --> 01:49:35.507
Tell the wagon to go to Suleyman Shah's
base camp, and we shall trace them.

01:49:35.907 --> 01:49:37.007
Come on.
-Alright, my Bey.

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.873
You keep moving for Suleyman Shah's
base camp, come on!

01:50:05.307 --> 01:50:06.307
Let's go.

01:52:25.607 --> 01:52:26.640
Let us go back.

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:08.740
Were you escaping somewhere,
Cardinal Thomas?

01:54:12.907 --> 01:54:14.607
Turns out we are destined to encounter.

01:54:47.307 --> 01:54:48.540
He drank from the fountain of martyrdom.

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:53.307
God's glory is great.

01:54:55.207 --> 01:54:58.640
He succeeded in this trial called life
with his honor.

01:55:01.607 --> 01:55:05.640
He found the true way in his last days
and become a martyr on this path.

01:55:08.973 --> 01:55:10.707
For this, we do not deem him as dead.

01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:17.573
He is one of the alive in God's presence.

01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:20.307
Amen!

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.607
We gave our first martyr.

01:55:24.473 --> 01:55:26.607
He shall be the last one if God permits.

01:55:27.373 --> 01:55:28.473
If God permits.

01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:37.940
Wild Demir is coming.

01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:00.540
I hope matters are fortunate, Wild Demir.

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:02.940
Not so fortunate, Bey.

01:56:03.907 --> 01:56:05.840
They noticed that we found out
about the tunnels.

01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:07.907
They demolished and sealed them again.

01:56:09.607 --> 01:56:12.907
As you see, we have no chance
of getting through there.

01:56:40.673 --> 01:56:42.007
There must be a way to enter this castle.

01:56:43.807 --> 01:56:45.307
We must find the second tunnel.

01:56:47.407 --> 01:56:48.407
Some way...

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.740
There must be a second way
to enter that castle.

01:56:53.973 --> 01:56:54.973
Son.

01:56:55.807 --> 01:56:58.907
Do not give rein to anger,
it is God who grants victory.

01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:02.207
If we are destined to conquer

01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:05.273
no one can stand in our way.

01:57:11.507 --> 01:57:12.873
There is a way to enter the castle!

01:57:18.573 --> 01:57:19.573
Brother!

01:57:24.407 --> 01:57:25.407
Yigit!

01:57:25.873 --> 01:57:27.540
-Ertugrul brother!
-My lad!

01:57:36.373 --> 01:57:38.373
How are you, my lad? How did you escape
from the castle?

01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:39.873
Shahzada.

01:57:55.307 --> 01:57:57.807
Gundogdu, how did this happen?

01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:00.340
The Cardinal, Bey, the Cardinal.

01:58:01.507 --> 01:58:03.773
We caught him trying to kidnap Yigit.

01:58:04.973 --> 01:58:06.207
Where is that demon?

01:58:06.473 --> 01:58:07.873
Do not worry, my brother.

01:58:08.207 --> 01:58:09.807
He is in the hands of our Alps,
carrying the supplies.

01:58:09.973 --> 01:58:11.473
He shall be coming with them.

01:58:14.973 --> 01:58:17.907
In short, there are news that our Shahzada
shall give you.

01:58:19.307 --> 01:58:20.307
My Shahzada.

01:58:25.773 --> 01:58:27.273
I know where the second tunnel is.

01:58:30.673 --> 01:58:32.740
Cardinal Thomas tried to smuggle me
from there.

01:58:38.973 --> 01:58:39.973
Brother!

01:58:51.373 --> 01:58:52.373
My lion!

01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:56.907
You came as a godsend.

01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:16.540
Omer...

01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:20.240
...you did not die for nothing, my lad.

01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:23.640
You did not die for nothing.

01:59:33.573 --> 01:59:34.573
This is it.

01:59:36.307 --> 01:59:37.707
Take revenge for our Alps they killed

01:59:39.207 --> 01:59:42.807
for Isadora and his father
for what they have done

01:59:44.373 --> 01:59:46.573
to Turgut brother and to my father,
Ertugrul brother.

01:59:47.673 --> 01:59:48.873
May God help you.

01:59:50.473 --> 01:59:56.273
No one can defeat as, long as we have
brave sons as you, with God's help.

02:00:04.907 --> 02:00:06.407
Come on Kursad's brave sons.

02:00:08.407 --> 02:00:10.407
Let us show them the might of Kayi tribe.

02:05:08.007 --> 02:05:09.607
Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you.

02:05:09.773 --> 02:05:11.407
Get out of here, come!
Come, get out of here!

02:05:11.607 --> 02:05:13.207
Come. Come.

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:15.473
Come.

02:05:16.373 --> 02:05:17.973
Come, get out of here!

02:05:20.273 --> 02:05:22.873
May God bless you! May God bless you!

02:05:23.207 --> 02:05:26.240
Take these ones out. Out, out!

02:05:27.707 --> 02:05:30.473
-May God protect you, young man.
-May God bless you.

02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:34.973
Thank you. Go now. Go now. Go now.

02:05:36.373 --> 02:05:37.540
Go now, take these ones out.

02:06:48.507 --> 02:06:50.973
I will send new messengers
to the Principality of Antioch.

02:06:52.607 --> 02:06:54.007
What if you cannot succeed in this too?

02:06:55.273 --> 02:06:58.640
I will do everything I can for you to
escape from the second tunnel, Ricardo.

02:07:03.907 --> 02:07:05.807
Kayi tribe has entered the castle, sir.

02:07:07.907 --> 02:07:09.807
How? How is this possible?

02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:11.907
They had found the second tunnel.

02:07:12.673 --> 02:07:15.473
Cardinal Thomas, I should not have
sent you from there.

02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:17.840
You coward!

02:08:26.007 --> 02:08:27.540
<i>Allahu akbar!</i>

02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:40.207

-God is one!
