Episode 22 will start after 12:21 min

00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,742
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

3
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,353
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

4
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:32,744
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

5
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:55,372
Talk.

6
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:57,505
What do you want from me?

7
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:02,739
I can see the hatred in your eyes.

8
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:06,472
But I know that you are clever enough...

9
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:10,039
...to understand that I do everything
for the nomad tent's future.

10
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:13,339
With that bastard named
Grandmaster Petruchio.

11
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:16,605
With that murderer named Titus.

12
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:20,839
And with that bastard named Black Toygar.
Did you ally with them for this?

13
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:23,372
This is not a personal matter.

14
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:27,539
I hate them as much as you do.

15
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,839
I am sure they hate me, too.

16
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:31,472
But I bear with them.

17
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:35,405
For what?
Only for the future of Kayis.

18
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:40,439
If your future is in the hands of the
Templars who guide the Crusaders...

19
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,672
...it is better for the Kayis to perish.

20
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,472
However, both Ertugrul and I
know very well that this is not the case.

21
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:56,772
He will reveal all your games
one by one.

22
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:01,472
He will make you regret
for what you did.

23
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:04,772
Suleyman Shah will take the crown back.

24
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:06,939
It is too late, Halime Sultan!

25
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:15,305
Suleyman Shah, his family,
and the ones who are with them...

26
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:19,239
...are not alive anymore.

27
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:20,839
You are lying.

28
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:24,239
Unfortunately, this was necessary.

29
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,505
But you can be at ease.

30
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:31,705
Turgut Alp must have done this
in a painless and fast way.

31
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:35,239
As to Ertugrul...

32
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:39,239
...Ertugrul and his Alps
Dogan and Bamsi...

33
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,605
...are in the hands of those
bastard Templars.

34
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:43,472
You are lying!

35
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:46,272
Listen to me carefully, Halime Sultan!

36
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:49,739
You do not have anybody left in your life.
Except your brother.

37
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:53,805
If you want to take your brother,
go far away and start a new life...

38
00:15:53,905 --> 00:15:56,805
...I am ready to give you
this opportunity.

39
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,305
What do you want?

40
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:04,039
Arabi's ark.

41
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:13,405
Ibn al-Arabi allowed
only the two of us...

42
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,605
...to know where this ark is.

43
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:17,372
He told us not to open it ever.

44
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,372
He will take it back when he comes back.

45
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,305
Listen, Halime Sultan...

46
00:16:22,405 --> 00:16:25,572
...if you tell me where the ark is...

47
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,772
...you can start a new life
with your brother.

48
00:16:29,705 --> 00:16:32,405
This is my first and last offer to you.

49
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,405
What is he doing here?

50
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:05,739
It is impossible for him
to do it and come back this fast.

51
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,839
Guard, let the Bey know.

52
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:09,905
Tell them Turgut Alp is here.

53
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:11,639
Yes, Bey.

54
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:47,405
I do not know anything
about Arabi's ark.

55
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,272
Lying does not befit
a beautiful sultan like you.

56
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:01,439
Why do you think
I know where the ark is?

57
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:05,872
Why would he give it to me
if it is important like that?

58
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:09,572
He gave it to Ertugrul, not to you.

59
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:15,405
But since Ertugrul was wounded,
Arabi handed the ark to you.

60
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:21,272
I will give you something
before I leave.

61
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:24,605
You will give it to Ertugrul
if he recovers before I come back.

62
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,772
Do not ever look inside it.

63
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:30,372
I will definitely protect it
at the risk of my life.

64
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,772
I got you watched everywhere.

65
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:38,405
I know every step you took
after Ertugrul recovered.

66
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:44,539
Now that you know
every step we took...

67
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:47,472
...you must know where I hid the ark.

68
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:54,772
Both you and your brother will die
if you do not talk!

69
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:02,772
-Bey?
-What is it?

70
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:06,239
Turgut Alp is back.
His hands were covered with blood.

71
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:10,039
Tell him to wait in the marquee.
I will go there.

72
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:22,639
Do you believe me now?

73
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,672
You do not have
anyone left in your life.

74
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:27,239
Think carefully.

75
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:30,739
This is you and your brother's
last chance.

76
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:10,025
Did you do it?

77
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,892
I did. They are all dead.

78
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:17,292
Tell me what happened.
I want to know everything.

79
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:24,325
They found an opportunity
to untie themselves.

80
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:33,325
They struggled to escape.

81
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:35,658
However...

82
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:57,825
-Turgut!
-No!

83
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:06,558
None of them could escape.

84
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,325
Good.

85
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:11,392
What about my Alps?

86
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,925
They are all dead.

87
00:21:13,792 --> 00:21:19,425
Both Alps and the Templars'
that the Grandmaster sent for precaution.

88
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:21,658
They are dead.

89
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:26,892
Well, well, Suleyman Shah.

90
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:29,058
Your time is over.

91
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:33,792
Do not tell anybody anything
about the Templars.

92
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:35,725
Of course, Bey.

93
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,858
Ayhan, did you hear something?

94
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:12,825
No, why did you ask?

95
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,525
You go, I will catch up with you.

96
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,058
Ayhan, do not get yourself into trouble.

97
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:52,392
Ertugrul Bey!

98
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:08,458
-Ayhan Alp.
-Thank God you are alive.

99
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:11,358
That bastard sent Suleyman Shah to exile.

100
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,558
I know.

101
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:19,025
-I have a request from you.
-Whatever you ask, Bey.

102
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:22,092
I can give my life
for you and Suleyman Shah.

103
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:23,725
Thank you.

104
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:26,525
You will go to Kurdoglu.

105
00:23:27,592 --> 00:23:31,392
You will say "If you want Ertugrul...

106
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:34,658
...he will come and surrender to you.

107
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:37,025
However...

108
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,525
...he has one condition.

109
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,658
He wants a headquarters meeting.

110
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:45,992
He wants to face you
in front of the beys."

111
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:51,892
After that, if he still wants
and if he still has enough power...

112
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,892
...he will take my head.

113
00:23:56,592 --> 00:23:58,725
Bey, what are you saying?

114
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:02,092
He overthrew my father
with betrayal in his marquee.

115
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:06,458
And I will take the throne back
in the same marquee by God's will.

116
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:09,758
This is my plan.

117
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:14,658
I want you to make Halime talk.

118
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:16,025
Do whatever is necessary.

119
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:17,958
Find out where the ark is.

120
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,558
Yes, Bey.

121
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:25,825
Go to Halime Sultan like this.

122
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:30,825
So that she will see how serious you are.

123
00:24:42,892 --> 00:24:44,992
We are ready, Bey.
We can set off.

124
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,058
Bring the Alps' corpses, Kutlu.

125
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:52,458
Let us organize a funeral
worthy of their heroism.

126
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:56,425
Let us read Quran and shed tears.
Let us grieve for them.

127
00:24:56,492 --> 00:25:01,592
Let our people see how right I was
to send Suleyman and his sons.

128
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:03,758
Let them admire me.

129
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:08,958
The pain of our lost Alps
will unite our nomad tent even more.

130
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:11,492
What shall I do with them?

131
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:17,425
Suleyman Shah and his family,
Wild Demir and his daughter...

132
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:20,325
...feed wolves and birds with them.

133
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:25,592
So that their rotten flesh
would be good for something.

134
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:30,325
Turgut... Let us go.

135
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:04,725
How could you let this persecution happen?

136
00:26:04,892 --> 00:26:06,825
How could you do this?

137
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:10,925
They killed all of them.

138
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:13,558
Yes. They all died
trying to rescue themselves.

139
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:16,092
What did they do to our tent?

140
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,825
Bey, they did not even have any swords.

141
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:24,992
It was clear that it was going to be
like that. Look at our tent now.

142
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:28,358
Everybody! Do not stay here!

143
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:30,658
I said do not stay here!

144
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:34,692
Do you not have any other thing to do?
I said do not stay here!

145
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:38,558
Go away!

146
00:26:43,492 --> 00:26:46,058
It was clear that
Kurdoglu would not let them live.

147
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:49,558
-He knew he would lose the throne.
-He did it because he was scared.

148
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,525
-It is a shame.
-He killed the women.

149
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,025
And poor Dundar.

150
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:56,358
Do not talk here like this.
Somebody may hear.

151
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:58,625
Here he comes.

152
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:29,625
Bey, they are coming!

153
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:20,025
This is his head stooge, Kutlu.

154
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,492
Here we start.

155
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,692
You know what to do, Ayhan.

156
00:28:28,758 --> 00:28:30,692
Do not worry, Bey.

157
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,792
Hide a sword under my seat in the meeting.

158
00:28:33,858 --> 00:28:35,958
-This is what I want from you.
-I understand, Bey.

159
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,425
I will take care of it.

160
00:28:38,992 --> 00:28:41,358
-May God help you.
-You too, Bey.

161
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:15,658
Turgut Alp will take care of you
until you say where the ark is.

162
00:29:16,592 --> 00:29:21,592
So that you can find out
how Suleyman and his family passed away.

163
00:29:22,658 --> 00:29:25,058
God will punish you all.

164
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:42,325
You...

165
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:46,892
You were Ertugrul Bey's closest friend.

166
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:50,625
You were his Alp.

167
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:53,625
You were his brother.

168
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:57,758
How could you do this?

169
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:02,325
How could you kill those people?

170
00:30:07,992 --> 00:30:10,358
I can kill you too, Halime Sultan.

171
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,292
Tell me where the ark is.

172
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:17,892
I would not tell you
even if I knew I would die.

173
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:22,058
If Ertugrul died...

174
00:30:23,492 --> 00:30:25,992
...I do not have a reason
to live on anyway.

175
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:30,025
To kill me would be the best gift
you could give me.

176
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:39,758
If you want your brother to live...

177
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,825
...do not make me wait.

178
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:49,092
They will let
neither me nor my brother live.

179
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,892
Yigit will live my father's fate
even though he lives.

180
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:56,892
It would be better for him to die.

181
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:00,425
You will not hear even a word from me.

182
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:06,592
Turgut Alp, have fun.

183
00:31:10,725 --> 00:31:13,392
Finish this before sunrise.

184
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,392
Bey...

185
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:54,758
What do you want, Ayhan?

186
00:31:55,925 --> 00:31:58,358
Ertugrul has something to say to you.

187
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:03,958
What are you talking about?
Where did this come from?

188
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:05,458
Where did he see him?

189
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:07,658
Bey, we were patrolling with the Alps.

190
00:32:08,358 --> 00:32:10,358
He showed up suddenly.

191
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:12,692
This is impossible.

192
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,758
Do you hear what you say?

193
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:18,592
Bey, he was very angry.
He put a knife on my throat.

194
00:32:18,658 --> 00:32:21,058
Talk! Talk, man!

195
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:23,558
What does he want? Halime?

196
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:27,025
No, Bey. He wants to confront you
in the headquarters.

197
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:07,892
I am scared of neither you nor Kurdoglu.

198
00:33:22,858 --> 00:33:24,525
Get out.

199
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:25,658
But, Bey...

200
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:27,492
Get out!

201
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,292
Get out!

202
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:21,958
<i>I am not a traitor.</i>

203
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:24,358
<i>I did not betray my ancestor Oghuz.</i>

204
00:34:24,492 --> 00:34:28,625
<i>The blood that spilled on my hands</i>
<i>were for the future of Kayis.</i>

205
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:32,058
<i>It was to be stronger, bigger.</i>

206
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:35,525
<i>It was to have a land and to be powerful.</i>

207
00:34:35,592 --> 00:34:37,792
May I come in, Bey?

208
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:39,525
Come in.

209
00:34:47,558 --> 00:34:48,825
You ordered me, Bey?

210
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:51,525
You will go
to the Templars' castle secretly.

211
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,558
You will tell them Ertugrul lives.

212
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,891
-Yes, Bey.
-Come on, be quick!

213
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:58,625
Wait.

214
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:02,625
Get Ayhan Alp followed.

215
00:35:02,692 --> 00:35:05,425
He clearly has a trouble.

216
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:07,658
I need to know every step he takes.

217
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:21,458
<i>These ominous infidels</i>
<i>could not just beat that son of Suleyman.</i>

218
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:25,592
<i>But I will give him such a death...</i>

219
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:29,725
May I come in, Bey?

220
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,325
Come in, Karabudak.

221
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:46,425
They beys and the people are anxious.

222
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:49,058
The Alps are bothered.

223
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:54,058
They go around saying
"How could we let such a thing happen?".

224
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,592
They need to be eased, Bey.

225
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:03,525
Otherwise, there will be
even more blood spilled.

226
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:06,992
Be at ease, Karabudak.

227
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,958
I know very well what I am doing.

228
00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:11,958
Send news to the beys.

229
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:14,358
I want them to come to my marquee
in the afternoon.

230
00:37:14,425 --> 00:37:15,858
Yes, Bey.

231
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:40,492
What do you want, Ayhan Alp?

232
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:41,992
Do you want to die?

233
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:45,592
Bey, I brought you
greetings from Ertugrul Bey.

234
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,825
Where are these damn corpses?

235
00:38:43,425 --> 00:38:45,325
Suleyman Shah?

236
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:48,758
What? You were not
expecting us, were you?

237
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:03,825
Come on!
What are you waiting for? Kill them!

238
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:07,658
-What are you waiting for? Come on!
-Do not bellow like an ox!

239
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:09,625
Come and take our lives.

240
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:14,492
Come here.
Come and learn by bitter experience.

241
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:12,425
Forgive...
Forgive me, Suleyman Bey.

242
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:17,658
It would be an insult to mercy
if I forgive you.

243
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:25,358
Feed birds and wolves with his corpse.

244
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:29,858
So that everybody sees what happens
to the ones who try to destroy Kayi.

245
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:37,392
It is meaningless for me to live
when my Yigit has died.

246
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:40,525
Kill me.

247
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:07,958
I brought you greetings
from Ertugrul Bey.

248
00:43:09,858 --> 00:43:11,658
Everybody is alright.

249
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:13,558
Do not worry.

250
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:19,825
We will all be saved.

251
00:43:20,992 --> 00:43:22,725
Turgut...

252
00:43:22,825 --> 00:43:24,792
How is this going to happen?

253
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:27,425
Let us be patient, sister.

254
00:43:28,492 --> 00:43:32,392
Ertugrul will save both us and the tent.

255
00:43:40,658 --> 00:43:44,658
{\an8}1 DAY AGO

256
00:44:35,658 --> 00:44:37,392
We will camp here.

257
00:46:59,758 --> 00:47:01,658
-Turgut!
-No! Father!

258
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:08,058
-Turgut, do not do that!
-Father!

259
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,525
Turgut!

260
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:12,092
Turgut, do not do that!

261
00:47:12,325 --> 00:47:13,525
Turgut!

262
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,092
Turgut, no!

263
00:47:16,358 --> 00:47:18,492
-Father!
-Turgut!

264
00:47:19,325 --> 00:47:21,425
At least, do not kill the women.

265
00:47:21,492 --> 00:47:23,492
It would be a shame. A sin.

266
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:26,425
-Father!
-Turgut!

267
00:47:31,592 --> 00:47:33,992
-Turgut!
-No!

268
00:47:34,058 --> 00:47:35,592
Turgut!

269
00:48:26,525 --> 00:48:27,692
Wild Demir!

270
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:20,992
Father! Gundogdu!

271
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:13,658
Brother...

272
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,292
My little brother!

273
00:53:24,092 --> 00:53:25,925
Father, where is Halime?

274
00:53:27,725 --> 00:53:30,092
Kurdoglu is holding her, son.

275
00:53:36,525 --> 00:53:38,025
Turgut...

276
00:53:38,992 --> 00:53:40,358
Turgut?

277
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:42,492
Are you alright?

278
00:53:42,558 --> 00:53:44,525
Father, Turgut is...

279
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,692
-Turgut.
-Turgut!

280
00:53:46,758 --> 00:53:48,792
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

281
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:52,458
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

282
00:53:52,658 --> 00:53:54,892
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

283
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:56,492
What is going on?

284
00:53:56,558 --> 00:53:58,358
-Turgut, son!
-What is going on?

285
00:53:58,458 --> 00:53:59,958
-Turgut!
-Bring some water.

286
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:03,092
Turgut!

287
00:54:12,858 --> 00:54:15,625
I have to go to the tent immediately.

288
00:54:15,692 --> 00:54:19,525
Be patient. Let us talk about it first.

289
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:22,625
There must be another way.

290
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:24,392
Gundogdu is right.

291
00:54:25,092 --> 00:54:26,992
We must act reasonably.

292
00:54:28,025 --> 00:54:30,792
If we want to overcome this plague...

293
00:54:30,858 --> 00:54:33,325
...we cannot show weakness.

294
00:54:33,392 --> 00:54:35,658
You must control your anger.

295
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:43,425
How is he?

296
00:54:44,492 --> 00:54:46,025
He is in so much pain.

297
00:54:50,392 --> 00:54:54,692
Kurdoglu brought him the drug
in the cage that Templars gave him.

298
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:57,658
He did not drink it.

299
00:54:58,425 --> 00:55:00,392
He struggled with himself.

300
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,892
If I ever catch you...

301
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:08,858
Oh, if I ever catch you...

302
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:25,825
Turgut.

303
00:55:25,892 --> 00:55:27,492
Ertugrul Bey.

304
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:29,625
Do not get up. You are not well.

305
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:33,958
We have to save the tent.

306
00:55:35,992 --> 00:55:37,958
I will not live any longer.

307
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:43,592
At least, I would like to do
my last duty until I die.

308
00:56:33,892 --> 00:56:35,825
God, help my Turgut.

309
00:56:37,092 --> 00:56:38,958
Give him strength.

310
00:56:46,292 --> 00:56:47,592
Aykiz.

311
00:57:10,992 --> 00:57:13,492
If you die, you will be my pride.

312
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:20,692
I will not have a man anymore.

313
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:24,925
I will die with your memories.

314
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:29,925
However...

315
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:34,292
...I am begging you,
do not talk about dying.

316
00:57:37,292 --> 00:57:39,292
Neither to me nor to yourself.

317
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:48,325
We will not let that ominous drug
to take over you.

318
00:57:49,692 --> 00:57:51,758
We will fight to death.

319
00:57:55,692 --> 00:57:57,692
The two of us, together.

320
00:57:59,492 --> 00:58:01,292
Do you understand me?

321
00:58:10,858 --> 00:58:12,858
I promise...

322
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,758
...I will not surrender.

323
00:58:36,792 --> 00:58:43,792
{\an8}THE DAY OF THE MEETING

324
00:58:44,592 --> 00:58:47,958
This matter will be closed today
by God's will.

325
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,925
Thank God.

326
00:58:50,992 --> 00:58:53,325
You have to be patient, Halime Sultan.

327
00:58:53,425 --> 00:58:55,558
Turgut, this is very dangerous.

328
00:58:56,558 --> 00:59:00,992
Ertugrul is alone, and you are still ill.

329
00:59:01,992 --> 00:59:04,725
We do not have any other choice.

330
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:23,992
Ertugrul Bey sent you his greetings.

331
00:59:24,092 --> 00:59:28,092
Do not worry,
we will do whatever we can.

332
00:59:29,758 --> 00:59:31,425
Thank you.

333
00:59:32,658 --> 00:59:36,325
May God help us.

334
00:59:44,658 --> 00:59:47,558
Turgut!

335
00:59:50,092 --> 00:59:51,692
Turgut...

336
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:55,725
Alright.

337
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:58,725
I am alright.

338
01:00:07,058 --> 01:00:09,025
Come on, let us go.

339
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:26,592
We do not have
any other choice, father.

340
01:00:26,658 --> 01:00:28,425
Kurdoglu must think we are dead.

341
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:31,492
This will increase
our possibility to succeed.

342
01:00:32,058 --> 01:00:35,792
If he finds out that we are alive...

343
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:38,992
...he will let neither Ertugrul
nor Turgut live.

344
01:00:41,892 --> 01:00:43,825
My brother is right, father.

345
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:48,758
We have to do this
before Kurdoglu finds out about the truth.

346
01:00:50,658 --> 01:00:54,592
We must convince him
to accept my participation to the meeting.

347
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,325
What if he does not?

348
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:00,858
Then, we will not have
any other choice...

349
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:03,358
...than going to all the Oghuz tents...

350
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:06,958
...and look for brave men
willing to fight.

351
01:01:08,692 --> 01:01:11,792
None of us would accept
so much blood to be spilled.

352
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:20,625
The beys would get themselves
out from this darkness...

353
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:25,558
...when Turgut tells what he went through
in the castle and reveals Kurdoglu.

354
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:27,858
As my brother said...

355
01:01:27,992 --> 01:01:31,458
...none of us would accept
more blood to be spilled.

356
01:01:39,058 --> 01:01:41,692
I am also worried about Turgut's illness.

357
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:46,058
Ertugrul, watch out for
both him and yourself.

358
01:01:48,025 --> 01:01:49,558
Alright, brother.

359
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:02,725
Bey, Ertugrul walking around the tent
is not a good sign.

360
01:02:02,825 --> 01:02:04,058
Everybody is anxious.

361
01:02:04,325 --> 01:02:06,625
Nobody can know how this will end.

362
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:20,425
Suleyman and his family died.

363
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:24,992
Are you afraid of Ertugrul
who is left by himself with only two Alps?

364
01:02:25,092 --> 01:02:27,758
We started this journey
for the sake of our tent's peace.

365
01:02:27,825 --> 01:02:29,825
We overcame so many challenges.

366
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:36,392
And now you started getting scared of that
Ertugrul who does not know his place?

367
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:38,625
Is this your notion of being a bey?

368
01:02:38,692 --> 01:02:40,958
Is this your notion of being a man?

369
01:02:43,558 --> 01:02:47,958
Is there anybody who has something to say
without getting ashamed?

370
01:02:48,025 --> 01:02:49,325
I asked a question!

371
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:51,025
No, Bey.

372
01:03:04,558 --> 01:03:07,025
Ertugrul wants to come to the meeting.

373
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,825
May him come, then.

374
01:03:08,892 --> 01:03:11,025
And learn his lesson.

375
01:03:13,892 --> 01:03:18,658
I will say all his lies one by one
to his face...

376
01:03:18,758 --> 01:03:22,058
...and kill him with my own hands.

377
01:03:46,929 --> 01:03:49,296
What are you talking about?

378
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:53,829
They all escaped?

379
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:59,096
Yes, sir. Ertugrul saved his family
with Turgut.

380
01:03:59,729 --> 01:04:01,696
All our knights are dead.

381
01:04:16,362 --> 01:04:17,729
Get out of my face!

382
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:28,029
Stupid.

383
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:32,396
I told you to kill him
when you caught him.

384
01:04:36,862 --> 01:04:39,796
God damn old man.

385
01:04:53,462 --> 01:04:55,729
Uncle, what are you doing?

386
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:03,362
I know you are a traitor
just like your father.

387
01:05:03,462 --> 01:05:07,629
I will kill you
like your sister and father.

388
01:05:09,462 --> 01:05:11,896
Take this bitch!

389
01:05:19,996 --> 01:05:23,029
God damn you. Suffer forever.

390
01:05:23,396 --> 01:05:26,562
-Sir, are you alright?
-Get out! Get out!

391
01:05:26,762 --> 01:05:27,962
Take her!

392
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:03,029
We must tell the situation
to the Grandsmaster.

393
01:06:03,296 --> 01:06:05,062
The Cardinal's man Claudius
attacked us.

394
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:07,496
He saved Ertugrul and his Alps.

395
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,996
Do not worry. I let him know.
He is about to come.

396
01:06:33,996 --> 01:06:35,596
Take the corpse away.

397
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:26,896
Are you alright, sir?

398
01:07:26,996 --> 01:07:28,496
I am, Titus.

399
01:07:29,562 --> 01:07:31,296
Just a small wound.

400
01:07:31,462 --> 01:07:32,929
That is all.

401
01:07:34,996 --> 01:07:37,529
One of Kurdoglu's men is here.

402
01:07:37,596 --> 01:07:39,829
He confirmed what the knight said.

403
01:07:40,496 --> 01:07:42,796
Ertugrul is alive.

404
01:07:44,762 --> 01:07:48,462
He will go to the meeting
and confront Kurdoglu.

405
01:07:48,562 --> 01:07:52,562
No. Suleyman's rule is over.

406
01:07:53,729 --> 01:07:55,996
We must catch Ertugrul.

407
01:07:56,729 --> 01:07:58,296
What about Turgut?

408
01:07:58,729 --> 01:08:01,629
He is obviously with Ertugrul.

409
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:05,329
How can this be possible?

410
01:08:05,496 --> 01:08:06,529
The drug...

411
01:08:06,629 --> 01:08:10,696
The drug is powerful, but...

412
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:14,296
...this is the power of faith, Titus.

413
01:08:15,662 --> 01:08:17,862
This is the power of faith.

414
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:23,329
He will clearly die in a lot of pain
because he did not take the drug.

415
01:08:24,462 --> 01:08:30,396
But he can serve us the last time
before he dies.

416
01:08:32,562 --> 01:08:36,396
He can give us Ertugrul's head.

417
01:08:38,429 --> 01:08:42,362
Ertugrul wants to overthrow Kurdoglu...

418
01:08:42,929 --> 01:08:46,062
...with Turgut's testimony.

419
01:08:47,096 --> 01:08:52,429
He wants to take the throne back
in front of the beys.

420
01:08:52,996 --> 01:08:57,362
Let us see who overthrows whom.

421
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:12,529
-Did you bury the corpses?
-Yes, sir.

422
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:14,929
Good.

423
01:09:15,662 --> 01:09:17,729
What about Arabi?

424
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:21,529
He thinks I converted to Islam
and became his disciple.

425
01:09:24,929 --> 01:09:26,562
What about his ark?

426
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,396
I found out that it is in the nomad tent.

427
01:09:30,062 --> 01:09:33,296
I saved Ertugrul and his Alps
from the Grandmaster's knights...

428
01:09:33,362 --> 01:09:35,929
...in order to be able to take the ark.

429
01:09:37,996 --> 01:09:41,096
Moreover, I know
the Grandmaster knows this.

430
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:47,029
My dear friend Petruchio...

431
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:51,762
...so you hide information from me.

432
01:09:53,462 --> 01:09:55,029
That is all, sir.

433
01:09:57,429 --> 01:10:00,829
You are the best knight I have ever known.

434
01:10:01,796 --> 01:10:03,996
May God protect you, son.

435
01:10:14,529 --> 01:10:17,562
God will punish you so bad...

436
01:10:19,029 --> 01:10:23,762
...that you will pay the price
of the sins you committed.

437
01:10:46,062 --> 01:10:47,729
Turk!

438
01:10:54,662 --> 01:10:56,596
You will send a message
to Kurdoglu.

439
01:10:56,662 --> 01:11:01,362
Tell him that
we want Halime Sultan and Turgut.

440
01:11:01,962 --> 01:11:07,462
Tell Kurdoglu that all his family escaped.

441
01:11:08,562 --> 01:11:12,029
And that the two of them is behind this.

442
01:11:12,329 --> 01:11:17,296
Be quick. You must arrive
before their meeting.

443
01:11:18,562 --> 01:11:20,029
Go now.

444
01:12:20,496 --> 01:12:22,496
Jesus Christ...

445
01:12:22,596 --> 01:12:26,096
...help them in their fight
against the persecutors.

446
01:12:26,329 --> 01:12:28,629
Make Ertugrul gain a victory.

447
01:12:29,862 --> 01:12:32,829
Enlighten their way
with your divine justice.

448
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:57,829
God, forgive my sins.

449
01:13:26,862 --> 01:13:28,329
Isadora?

450
01:13:29,496 --> 01:13:30,929
Isadora!

451
01:13:31,829 --> 01:13:33,529
Isadora!

452
01:13:34,696 --> 01:13:36,562
Isadora!

453
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:57,396
My beautiful niece
paid the price of her betrayal.

454
01:13:57,996 --> 01:13:59,862
Murderer!

455
01:13:59,929 --> 01:14:01,362
She was your blood.

456
01:14:01,429 --> 01:14:04,762
She was from bad blood.

457
01:14:04,829 --> 01:14:06,096
And she died.

458
01:14:06,796 --> 01:14:11,462
You have been given a last chance
to live, Shahzade.

459
01:14:12,629 --> 01:14:16,829
You will go to Konstantiniyye
with Cardinal Thomas.

460
01:14:17,596 --> 01:14:21,096
Otherwise, you will die like Isadora.

461
01:14:22,996 --> 01:14:24,596
Think thoroughly.

462
01:14:24,796 --> 01:14:27,696
I would rather die instead of serving you.

463
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,062
We will see...

464
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:33,429
...how much longer
you will talk like that.

465
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:00,562
Be very careful.

466
01:15:01,529 --> 01:15:02,762
The war begins now.

467
01:15:03,296 --> 01:15:04,496
Yes, Bey.

468
01:15:39,296 --> 01:15:41,862
Thank God you are alive.

469
01:15:41,929 --> 01:15:44,496
You made me so happy.

470
01:15:44,562 --> 01:15:46,896
We are all ready to die for you.

471
01:15:48,996 --> 01:15:53,029
Did Kurdoglu accept
confronting Ertugrul in the meeting?

472
01:15:53,296 --> 01:15:54,562
He did, Bey.

473
01:15:54,662 --> 01:15:55,896
I will go there.

474
01:15:56,829 --> 01:16:00,529
He promised that
he will be fair to you in the meeting.

475
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:06,096
I am sure he will do
as much as he can for the sake of justice.

476
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:08,796
None of us wanted this happen, Bey.

477
01:16:08,896 --> 01:16:12,929
We are all ready to give our heads
for the sake of justice.

478
01:16:13,862 --> 01:16:15,696
Thank you.

479
01:16:15,796 --> 01:16:17,562
We do not doubt about it.

480
01:16:17,662 --> 01:16:21,062
You proved this
by coming here, anyway.

481
01:16:22,029 --> 01:16:24,662
May God protect our tent.

482
01:16:24,762 --> 01:16:25,896
-Amen.
-Amen.

483
01:16:25,996 --> 01:16:27,562
Amen.

484
01:17:03,529 --> 01:17:05,362
Come here, Halime Sultan.

485
01:17:10,562 --> 01:17:12,029
Sit down.

486
01:17:13,096 --> 01:17:15,462
May their hands break.

487
01:17:15,529 --> 01:17:18,929
That bastard Turgut
did so many bad things to you.

488
01:17:19,896 --> 01:17:23,296
First he beat you,
then he sent me to take care of you.

489
01:17:23,429 --> 01:17:25,529
Ugly face.

490
01:17:26,296 --> 01:17:28,096
No, I am alright.

491
01:17:29,296 --> 01:17:31,562
It is all because of Selcan Hatun.

492
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:34,962
Hold on there, Eydis.

493
01:17:36,996 --> 01:17:39,362
What are you going to say?

494
01:17:41,462 --> 01:17:46,062
Whatever. She is dead now
with all her sins.

495
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:48,796
It would not be appropriate for me
to talk ill about her.

496
01:17:48,896 --> 01:17:50,396
Say it, Eydis!

497
01:17:50,496 --> 01:17:52,329
Say what you have to say.

498
01:17:55,729 --> 01:17:58,362
She was such an ominous woman.

499
01:18:00,029 --> 01:18:06,829
When Alpargu stabbed
late Gokce Hatun on her groin...

500
01:18:07,496 --> 01:18:09,962
...she wanted to get her married with
Ertugrul Bey...

501
01:18:10,029 --> 01:18:13,529
...even though she knew
she was not going to have a baby.

502
01:18:14,396 --> 01:18:17,096
She gave me gold money
to prevent me talk.

503
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:20,796
And I took them with these
ominous hands of mine.

504
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:25,462
And that baby matter...

505
01:18:26,096 --> 01:18:27,829
What about the baby?

506
01:18:27,929 --> 01:18:32,496
I was suspicious of her pregnancy
in spite of being an infertile woman.

507
01:18:33,329 --> 01:18:37,329
And she whipped Aykiz
because she lost her baby.

508
01:18:38,762 --> 01:18:41,729
Anyway. God forgive her sins.

509
01:18:42,429 --> 01:18:44,629
Let me go if you are alright.

510
01:18:52,596 --> 01:18:55,596
There will not be peace
in a place like this...

511
01:18:56,596 --> 01:18:58,729
...where there are such sins...

512
01:18:58,796 --> 01:19:03,829
...and pathetic people like me
who do bad things for money.

513
01:19:05,029 --> 01:19:06,996
God forgive our sins.

514
01:19:20,062 --> 01:19:22,396
You cannot trust Kurdoglu's promise.

515
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:24,829
We talked about this, father.

516
01:19:24,896 --> 01:19:26,962
He thinks all of you are dead.

517
01:19:28,496 --> 01:19:30,396
I have to do this alone.

518
01:19:30,496 --> 01:19:32,862
Ayhan talked to the beys
who are close to us.

519
01:19:32,929 --> 01:19:34,762
And with the Alps.

520
01:19:34,829 --> 01:19:37,862
Do not worry.
I will not be alone in the tent.

521
01:19:38,796 --> 01:19:41,896
Turgut will be waiting for me
in the marquee.

522
01:19:44,929 --> 01:19:47,929
If anything happens to me...

523
01:19:49,462 --> 01:19:51,096
...take care of Halime.

524
01:19:54,996 --> 01:19:56,529
Give me your blessings.

525
01:19:57,396 --> 01:19:58,796
You have it.

526
01:20:07,762 --> 01:20:09,562
May God protect you.

527
01:20:29,062 --> 01:20:30,896
Peace be upon you.

528
01:20:30,962 --> 01:20:32,396
And peace be upon you.

529
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:34,396
Peace be upon you.

530
01:20:34,862 --> 01:20:36,929
Thank you so much.

531
01:20:37,029 --> 01:20:38,829
You sent help with Omer.

532
01:20:38,929 --> 01:20:41,329
Thank you, son.

533
01:20:42,096 --> 01:20:44,462
Where are you going?

534
01:20:44,529 --> 01:20:45,829
To the tent.

535
01:20:45,896 --> 01:20:48,096
I am going to take what we deserve.

536
01:20:48,396 --> 01:20:53,562
Stay on God's path,
and he will be with you.

537
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:58,329
The victory belongs to God
even though our blood may be spilled.

538
01:20:58,462 --> 01:20:59,962
Hopefully.

539
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:10,896
Excuse us.

540
01:22:26,829 --> 01:22:29,096
Turgut!

541
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:40,062
Did Halime Sultan talk?

542
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:43,329
Not yet.

543
01:22:44,596 --> 01:22:47,496
But she will.

544
01:22:47,596 --> 01:22:49,829
Listen to me carefully, Turgut.

545
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:54,062
I have a good idea to make her talk.

546
01:22:54,296 --> 01:22:56,696
You will take a walk with her.

547
01:23:02,429 --> 01:23:03,929
Go.

548
01:23:04,662 --> 01:23:06,429
Yes, Bey.

549
01:23:57,529 --> 01:23:59,462
Ertugrul warned me a lot.

550
01:23:59,962 --> 01:24:01,529
Also, you.

551
01:24:02,896 --> 01:24:07,062
All the things you said about Kurdoglu
turned out to be right.

552
01:24:07,329 --> 01:24:10,829
It was a big mistake for me
not to listen to him back then.

553
01:24:14,896 --> 01:24:17,862
He said he did not want justice
to be hurt.

554
01:24:17,962 --> 01:24:19,596
He was right.

555
01:24:20,729 --> 01:24:24,829
May the justice not be hurt.
We can accept to be hurt.

556
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:29,396
May God protect us from the shame...

557
01:24:29,462 --> 01:24:34,929
...of forcing our children
live in a place where there is no justice.

558
01:24:41,296 --> 01:24:43,329
Everything will be alright.

559
01:24:44,062 --> 01:24:45,662
It is Friday today.

560
01:24:48,062 --> 01:24:51,062
God does justice to innocent people.

561
01:24:56,796 --> 01:24:59,029
May God keep you always with me.

562
01:25:21,096 --> 01:25:22,829
My girl...

563
01:25:25,062 --> 01:25:27,429
Do you need anything, father?

564
01:25:27,496 --> 01:25:29,362
Thank you.

565
01:25:29,429 --> 01:25:31,529
How is Gundogdu doing?

566
01:25:35,429 --> 01:25:38,396
He is trying to get rid of the
poison inside him.

567
01:25:38,462 --> 01:25:40,729
He will be alright in a few days.

568
01:25:52,529 --> 01:25:56,729
Selcan became a good daughter suddenly.
What do you say?

569
01:26:01,429 --> 01:26:07,729
She was disciplined by the situation
of first her sister, then her man.

570
01:26:10,396 --> 01:26:12,929
I hope you are right.

571
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,329
Do you think he will recover?

572
01:26:51,396 --> 01:26:53,296
God knows.

573
01:26:53,429 --> 01:26:54,929
Let us pray.

574
01:26:56,596 --> 01:26:59,629
God, forgive me.

575
01:27:05,096 --> 01:27:08,662
You have to deserve to be forgiven first.

576
01:27:10,096 --> 01:27:12,396
How can I deserve that?

577
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:16,062
My daughter...

578
01:27:16,329 --> 01:27:19,596
...if you want to deserve
to be forgiven...

579
01:27:19,729 --> 01:27:22,662
...you need to cleanse your heart first.

580
01:27:22,762 --> 01:27:25,396
The heart is our valuable asset.

581
01:27:26,496 --> 01:27:31,962
Our Prophet told us that
God says...

582
01:27:33,296 --> 01:27:35,996
..."The heavens and the earth
cannot contain Me...

583
01:27:36,062 --> 01:27:39,329
...but the heart of a true believer can."

584
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:42,696
Therefore, this heart of ours...

585
01:27:43,462 --> 01:27:45,862
...is the biggest treasure of human.

586
01:27:46,729 --> 01:27:47,862
My daughter...

587
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:50,496
...if you wish to be forgiven...

588
01:27:51,062 --> 01:27:53,896
...be like Hazrat Khadija.

589
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:58,596
Hazrat Khadija challenged
all the non-believers...

590
01:27:58,729 --> 01:28:05,029
...with our Prophet
when the spread of Islam began.

591
01:28:05,662 --> 01:28:09,696
She wanted to be the ointment
when his heart was broken.

592
01:28:10,462 --> 01:28:13,596
She spent her money
to spread her husband's cause.

593
01:28:14,096 --> 01:28:16,996
She believed him when others did not.

594
01:28:17,496 --> 01:28:22,796
She supported him
while everybody was avoiding him.

595
01:28:23,996 --> 01:28:28,896
And God granted our Prophet
children from her.

596
01:28:31,429 --> 01:28:35,362
Therefore,
let Hazrat Khadija be your guide.

597
01:29:10,896 --> 01:29:12,596
What is going on, Turgut?

598
01:29:12,696 --> 01:29:14,329
Where are we going?

599
01:29:14,962 --> 01:29:17,896
This is not good at all, Halime Sultan.

600
01:29:18,762 --> 01:29:21,362
Something is wrong.

601
01:29:31,696 --> 01:29:34,996
What is going on?
Where did we come here?

602
01:29:36,996 --> 01:29:41,396
We will go to the tent,
and you will go to the castle.

603
01:30:05,796 --> 01:30:07,029
Turgut!

604
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:25,770
God, help my son.

605
01:42:27,303 --> 01:42:30,603
Help him, so that
the persecution will be over.

606
01:42:31,037 --> 01:42:32,370
-Amen.
-Amen.

607
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:36,170
God granted him a conquest for sure.

608
01:42:37,303 --> 01:42:39,603
Our Prophet set off to Taif...

609
01:42:39,703 --> 01:42:42,503
...in order to find
a peaceful land for the believers...

610
01:42:42,603 --> 01:42:46,770
...when the persecutions of the
non-believers in Macca increased.

611
01:42:47,737 --> 01:42:52,637
Taif did not see the grace even though
there were high hopes about them.

612
01:42:52,803 --> 01:42:57,503
Our Prophet did not lose hope
when all doors were shut on his face.

613
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:01,203
He struggles on
to make his cause be heard...

614
01:43:01,303 --> 01:43:05,270
...and to be able to make
even one person a believer.

615
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:11,503
However, the people of Taif
threw stones at him. They persecuted.

616
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:16,837
Our Prophet went outside Taif, wounded.

617
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:19,770
Angel Jibreel showed up.

618
01:43:20,603 --> 01:43:24,637
He said they would destroy Taif
if our Prophet wanted.

619
01:43:26,137 --> 01:43:30,637
However, our Prophet
who was sent as a mercy to all creation...

620
01:43:30,837 --> 01:43:35,070
...said "No, I do not want them
to be destroyed.

621
01:43:35,137 --> 01:43:39,603
I wish God brings up people
from their generation...

622
01:43:39,703 --> 01:43:45,037
...who will serve and pray
only to God, and not to others."

623
01:43:46,237 --> 01:43:50,137
The people of Taif
became Muslims years after that.

624
01:43:50,237 --> 01:43:52,570
Mercy prevailed over persecution.

625
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:58,337
Hopefully, mercy will prevail
over persecution again.

626
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:54,308
Our Bey is coming!
Our tent will be happy!

627
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:55,674
Welcome, Bey!

628
01:30:55,774 --> 01:30:58,008
May God keep you always with us!

629
01:30:58,841 --> 01:31:00,841
Welcome, Bey!

630
01:31:03,074 --> 01:31:04,241
Welcome, Bey!

631
01:31:05,141 --> 01:31:06,908
Ertugrul Bey, welcome!

632
01:31:11,908 --> 01:31:13,874
May God help you, Bey!

633
01:31:17,174 --> 01:31:18,774
Welcome, Bey!

634
01:31:37,108 --> 01:31:38,674
Welcome, Bey!

635
01:31:52,741 --> 01:31:54,541
Ertugrul is here, Bey.

636
01:31:54,641 --> 01:31:57,041
So he comes.

637
01:32:06,574 --> 01:32:08,008
Welcome, Bey.

638
01:32:08,074 --> 01:32:09,241
Welcome, Bey.

639
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:12,274
May God keep you always with us.

640
01:32:12,574 --> 01:32:14,641
Welcome, Bey.

641
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:16,641
May God help you.

642
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:36,241
Today is the day
to pay the price, Ertugrul.

643
01:32:39,208 --> 01:32:41,641
You are right, Karabudak.

644
01:32:42,174 --> 01:32:44,774
Today is the day to pay the price.

645
01:32:44,841 --> 01:32:49,041
Everybody will pay the price
in the Judgment Day.

646
01:32:51,141 --> 01:32:53,774
Thankfully, we have no doubt about it.

647
01:32:58,274 --> 01:33:00,608
However...

648
01:33:00,674 --> 01:33:03,908
...it would break my heart
for you and Kurdoglu...

649
01:33:04,008 --> 01:33:07,574
...to wait until the Judgment Day
to pay your price.

650
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:05,574
Our condolences, Ertugrul Bey.

651
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:08,541
Our condolences.
May God give you patience.

652
01:36:08,608 --> 01:36:11,808
Our condolences, Bey.
May God give you patience.

653
01:36:11,908 --> 01:36:14,074
Our condolences, Bey.

654
01:37:14,508 --> 01:37:17,608
I heard you wanted to
confront me, Ertugrul.

655
01:37:29,508 --> 01:37:32,974
As your loyal dog Karabudak said...

656
01:37:36,941 --> 01:37:39,208
...today is the day to pay the price.

657
01:37:41,308 --> 01:37:45,541
I will disregard
your father's holy memory...

658
01:37:46,774 --> 01:37:49,741
...and I will smash you here!

659
01:37:52,108 --> 01:37:53,741
Know your place!

660
01:37:59,308 --> 01:38:01,641
Ertugrul...

661
01:38:02,741 --> 01:38:06,407
Nobody recognizes you
neither in this marquee...

662
01:38:06,907 --> 01:38:08,774
...nor in this meeting...

663
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:14,174
...or in any forage where oxen grass.

664
01:38:16,607 --> 01:38:21,441
I just accepted you in my marquee
out of respect to your father.

665
01:38:21,907 --> 01:38:23,907
If you cross the line...

666
01:38:24,141 --> 01:38:27,574
...you should know that
I will impale you in the tent square!

667
01:38:30,807 --> 01:38:32,607
Your loss and pain is big.

668
01:38:32,774 --> 01:38:38,507
However, if you have even a little respect
left for the people of this tent...

669
01:38:39,307 --> 01:38:41,674
...do not provoke disturbance.

670
01:38:42,507 --> 01:38:46,174
It was decided that
your family would be exiled.

671
01:38:47,441 --> 01:38:50,541
They were going to be sent
to your uncle Korkut's tent.

672
01:38:50,607 --> 01:38:56,941
However, your father and brother
chose to go against this decision.

673
01:38:58,774 --> 01:39:00,741
May them rest in peace.

674
01:39:00,807 --> 01:39:02,474
Amen.

675
01:39:03,807 --> 01:39:06,707
Now, say what you want to say.

676
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:10,707
And then, obey the decision
that will be given here.

677
01:39:12,607 --> 01:39:15,874
Are you planning to kill me
on the way...

678
01:39:16,174 --> 01:39:19,341
...by way of the Templars
that you have been allying with...

679
01:39:19,441 --> 01:39:23,341
...and with the Alps that you bought,
like you did to my family?

680
01:39:24,807 --> 01:39:26,541
What is going on?

681
01:39:28,707 --> 01:39:30,474
That is enough, Bey.

682
01:39:30,574 --> 01:39:33,874
This tactless man
has crossed the line way over.

683
01:39:37,641 --> 01:39:40,641
Now that Kurdoglu Bey
invited him here...

684
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:43,874
...let him talk, Karabudak.

685
01:39:44,541 --> 01:39:47,707
Now that this is the place
where God's justice will be done...

686
01:39:48,841 --> 01:39:51,741
...I say let us allow
Ertugrul Bey to say what he has to say.

687
01:39:51,807 --> 01:39:53,341
He is right!

688
01:39:53,407 --> 01:39:55,441
He is right.

689
01:39:59,341 --> 01:40:01,174
Thank you.

690
01:40:02,174 --> 01:40:08,807
The price for blaming a bey
in his marquee like this is very high.

691
01:40:13,207 --> 01:40:17,141
You will not get out of here alive
if you go on like this.

692
01:40:21,907 --> 01:40:26,374
You are not the bey of this tent,
Kurdoglu.

693
01:40:29,174 --> 01:40:33,841
You are a disgrace
to the people of Oghuz and Kayis.

694
01:40:36,774 --> 01:40:39,341
My words reflect the truth.

695
01:40:40,241 --> 01:40:43,474
I have two witnesses to prove them.

696
01:40:44,341 --> 01:40:48,674
I would like you Beys to allow these
witnesses enter the marquee.

697
01:40:49,507 --> 01:40:52,407
Let them come, Bey!

698
01:40:55,507 --> 01:40:57,741
Alright, then.

699
01:40:57,807 --> 01:41:01,841
However, I am sure
you also noticed that...

700
01:41:01,907 --> 01:41:04,541
...there are three beys missing here.

701
01:41:09,841 --> 01:41:12,574
They apologized from you.

702
01:41:21,274 --> 01:41:22,541
What is going on?

703
01:41:22,607 --> 01:41:23,874
What is going on?

704
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:21,190
Brother!

705
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:25,690
Halime Sultan, are you alright?

706
01:46:25,756 --> 01:46:27,356
I am.

707
01:46:27,656 --> 01:46:31,623
I am so glad to see you three
like this again.

708
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:39,423
Turgut!

709
01:46:39,523 --> 01:46:41,556
Brother Turgut!

710
01:46:41,623 --> 01:46:45,990
-Brother, are you alright?
-I am.

711
01:46:46,090 --> 01:46:47,690
I need to go to the tent.

712
01:46:54,156 --> 01:46:55,490
Come on, brother.

713
01:46:59,423 --> 01:47:01,090
Come on, brother.

714
01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:14,256
Peace be upon you.

715
01:47:16,223 --> 01:47:18,090
And peace be upon you.

716
01:47:18,723 --> 01:47:22,156
I see that things went crazy
while I was away.

717
01:47:29,656 --> 01:47:33,556
Tell me, then. What did your witnesses
witness against me?

718
01:47:35,723 --> 01:47:42,123
That you allied with Black Toygar
and got the train raided.

719
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:56,323
That you got fifteen of our Alps martyred.

720
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:07,423
That you allied with the Templars and
brought all kinds of troubles in the tent.

721
01:48:12,723 --> 01:48:16,056
Enough is enough, Bey!
How much longer are we...

722
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:27,056
That you went to the castle
a lot of times...

723
01:48:27,156 --> 01:48:31,090
...and committed crimes
with their Grandmaster Mancini.

724
01:48:41,123 --> 01:48:43,256
Well, well, well.

725
01:48:43,356 --> 01:48:46,523
Look how strong witnesses
my niece Ertugrul has.

726
01:48:48,056 --> 01:48:49,623
I do.

727
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:55,190
They saw and heard in person
that you are a traitor, Kurdoglu.

728
01:49:00,156 --> 01:49:03,323
They will also witness that...

729
01:49:03,423 --> 01:49:07,756
...you bought men in the tent
with the gold you took from Mancini.

730
01:49:10,123 --> 01:49:16,090
They will tell who the bastards
you bought are one by one.

731
01:49:26,223 --> 01:49:28,590
Who is your witness?

732
01:49:28,656 --> 01:49:30,056
It is Turgut Alp.

733
01:49:31,123 --> 01:49:34,690
Do you think I do not know that
you and Turgut Alp killed my Alps...

734
01:49:34,756 --> 01:49:37,656
...who were taking your family to exile?

735
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:40,390
Ertugrul Bey would never do that.

736
01:49:42,323 --> 01:49:44,623
Oh, Ertugrul.

737
01:49:44,690 --> 01:49:47,523
It seems like you underestimated Kurdoglu.

738
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:55,990
They tried to set up a trap for me.

739
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:58,156
They won Halime Sultan over.

740
01:49:59,256 --> 01:50:03,390
They are trying to ruin my reputation
with all kinds of slanders.

741
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:08,323
But they do not know that
I will be the one who ruins them.

742
01:50:09,023 --> 01:50:11,423
There will not be an exile anymore.

743
01:50:12,656 --> 01:50:14,523
I will kill you all, Ertugrul.

744
01:50:14,623 --> 01:50:17,356
I will not let any of you live.

745
01:50:17,423 --> 01:50:22,256
I will kill your family even if they go
to the other side of the world!

746
01:50:22,323 --> 01:50:24,723
Alps! Catch him!

747
01:52:04,256 --> 01:52:08,323
I will kill you here
unless you confess everything.

748
01:52:08,723 --> 01:52:10,590
Talk, Kurdoglu!

749
01:52:11,623 --> 01:52:14,690
My beys, they are all lies!

750
01:52:14,756 --> 01:52:16,690
They are all slander!

751
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:18,490
Do not be scared, my Beys!

752
01:52:18,556 --> 01:52:20,256
They are all lies!

753
01:52:22,590 --> 01:52:27,723
Kurdoglu, the truth came,
and the lies went away.

754
01:52:36,023 --> 01:52:37,990
-Turgut Alp.
-Yes, Bey.

755
01:52:38,523 --> 01:52:42,590
Send a message to Suleyman Shah
and tell him that he can come.

756
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:45,456
-He can come to his marquee.
-Yes, Bey.

757
01:52:50,023 --> 01:52:54,490
I hope this holy marquee
does not have a shame like this anymore.

758
01:54:09,723 --> 01:54:11,656
Father...

759
01:54:12,156 --> 01:54:13,790
...the fire is lit.

760
01:54:25,356 --> 01:54:27,423
Ertugrul succeeded.

761
01:54:38,190 --> 01:54:40,256
Let us go, then.

762
01:54:43,656 --> 01:54:46,589
Hayme, you will catch up with us.

763
01:54:46,690 --> 01:54:48,323
As you wish, Bey.

764
01:54:49,623 --> 01:54:52,156
Abdurrahman, get the horses ready!

765
01:54:52,223 --> 01:54:53,790
Yes, Bey!

766
01:55:14,656 --> 01:55:17,123
<i>I swear by the name of God</i>

767
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:22,256
<i>Who creates everything with one word</i>

768
01:55:22,356 --> 01:55:28,356
<i>And fills our hearts with faith</i>
<i>I swear by my weapon, my flag</i>

769
01:55:32,623 --> 01:55:35,090
<i>In this path to war</i>

770
01:55:36,790 --> 01:55:39,090
<i>May my ancestor Hizir be my companion</i>

771
01:55:39,156 --> 01:55:41,590
<i>And Hazrat Ali my guide</i>

772
01:55:53,590 --> 01:55:57,423
<i>May Zulfiqar be my weapon</i>
<i>And Duldul my horse</i>

773
01:55:58,456 --> 01:56:02,156
<i>May the dawn be ours</i>
<i>And the victory be God's</i>

774
01:56:44,323 --> 01:56:47,356
-Welcome, Bey!
-Welcome!

775
01:56:47,523 --> 01:56:51,456
Welcome, Bey!
May God keep you always with us.

776
01:59:28,456 --> 01:59:31,190
Mercy...

777
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:42,356
There is no mercy for traitors, Kurdoglu.
