00:01.000 --> 01:41.000
Episode 22 will start after 12:21 min

12:21.742 --> 12:24.742
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:25.353 --> 12:28.353
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:29.744 --> 12:32.744
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:53.239 --> 13:55.372
Talk.

13:55.439 --> 13:57.505
What do you want from me?

13:58.672 --> 14:02.739
I can see the hatred in your eyes.

14:03.872 --> 14:06.472
But I know that you are clever enough...

14:06.539 --> 14:10.039
...to understand that I do everything
for the nomad tent's future.

14:10.305 --> 14:13.339
With that bastard named
Grandmaster Petruchio.

14:13.872 --> 14:16.605
With that murderer named Titus.

14:17.272 --> 14:20.839
And with that bastard named Black Toygar.
Did you ally with them for this?

14:20.905 --> 14:23.372
This is not a personal matter.

14:23.972 --> 14:27.539
I hate them as much as you do.

14:27.639 --> 14:29.839
I am sure they hate me, too.

14:29.905 --> 14:31.472
But I bear with them.

14:31.539 --> 14:35.405
For what?
Only for the future of Kayis.

14:35.939 --> 14:40.439
If your future is in the hands of the
Templars who guide the Crusaders...

14:41.839 --> 14:44.672
...it is better for the Kayis to perish.

14:46.039 --> 14:50.472
However, both Ertugrul and I
know very well that this is not the case.

14:53.572 --> 14:56.772
He will reveal all your games
one by one.

14:58.739 --> 15:01.472
He will make you regret
for what you did.

15:02.439 --> 15:04.772
Suleyman Shah will take the crown back.

15:04.872 --> 15:06.939
It is too late, Halime Sultan!

15:09.672 --> 15:15.305
Suleyman Shah, his family,
and the ones who are with them...

15:16.872 --> 15:19.239
...are not alive anymore.

15:19.305 --> 15:20.839
You are lying.

15:21.805 --> 15:24.239
Unfortunately, this was necessary.

15:25.439 --> 15:27.505
But you can be at ease.

15:27.572 --> 15:31.705
Turgut Alp must have done this
in a painless and fast way.

15:32.939 --> 15:35.239
As to Ertugrul...

15:35.305 --> 15:39.239
...Ertugrul and his Alps
Dogan and Bamsi...

15:39.339 --> 15:41.605
...are in the hands of those
bastard Templars.

15:41.672 --> 15:43.472
You are lying!

15:43.539 --> 15:46.272
Listen to me carefully, Halime Sultan!

15:46.339 --> 15:49.739
You do not have anybody left in your life.
Except your brother.

15:49.805 --> 15:53.805
If you want to take your brother,
go far away and start a new life...

15:53.905 --> 15:56.805
...I am ready to give you
this opportunity.

15:58.239 --> 16:00.305
What do you want?

16:01.972 --> 16:04.039
Arabi's ark.

16:10.939 --> 16:13.405
Ibn al-Arabi allowed
only the two of us...

16:13.505 --> 16:15.605
...to know where this ark is.

16:15.672 --> 16:17.372
He told us not to open it ever.

16:17.439 --> 16:19.372
He will take it back when he comes back.

16:20.539 --> 16:22.305
Listen, Halime Sultan...

16:22.405 --> 16:25.572
...if you tell me where the ark is...

16:25.639 --> 16:28.772
...you can start a new life
with your brother.

16:29.705 --> 16:32.405
This is my first and last offer to you.

16:59.405 --> 17:01.405
What is he doing here?

17:02.572 --> 17:05.739
It is impossible for him
to do it and come back this fast.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.839
Guard, let the Bey know.

17:08.272 --> 17:09.905
Tell them Turgut Alp is here.

17:10.005 --> 17:11.639
Yes, Bey.

17:45.005 --> 17:47.405
I do not know anything
about Arabi's ark.

17:53.472 --> 17:57.272
Lying does not befit
a beautiful sultan like you.

17:58.439 --> 18:01.439
Why do you think
I know where the ark is?

18:02.672 --> 18:05.872
Why would he give it to me
if it is important like that?

18:05.972 --> 18:09.572
He gave it to Ertugrul, not to you.

18:10.705 --> 18:15.405
But since Ertugrul was wounded,
Arabi handed the ark to you.

18:18.439 --> 18:21.272
I will give you something
before I leave.

18:21.372 --> 18:24.605
You will give it to Ertugrul
if he recovers before I come back.

18:24.705 --> 18:26.772
Do not ever look inside it.

18:26.872 --> 18:30.372
I will definitely protect it
at the risk of my life.

18:31.039 --> 18:33.772
I got you watched everywhere.

18:33.872 --> 18:38.405
I know every step you took
after Ertugrul recovered.

18:40.805 --> 18:44.539
Now that you know
every step we took...

18:44.705 --> 18:47.472
...you must know where I hid the ark.

18:50.605 --> 18:54.772
Both you and your brother will die
if you do not talk!

19:01.305 --> 19:02.772
-Bey?
-What is it?

19:02.872 --> 19:06.239
Turgut Alp is back.
His hands were covered with blood.

19:06.305 --> 19:10.039
Tell him to wait in the marquee.
I will go there.

19:20.939 --> 19:22.639
Do you believe me now?

19:23.539 --> 19:25.672
You do not have
anyone left in your life.

19:25.772 --> 19:27.239
Think carefully.

19:27.905 --> 19:30.739
This is you and your brother's
last chance.

20:08.425 --> 20:10.025
Did you do it?

20:10.625 --> 20:13.892
I did. They are all dead.

20:13.992 --> 20:17.292
Tell me what happened.
I want to know everything.

20:18.858 --> 20:24.325
They found an opportunity
to untie themselves.

20:31.092 --> 20:33.325
They struggled to escape.

20:34.425 --> 20:35.658
However...

20:55.392 --> 20:57.825
-Turgut!
-No!

21:04.758 --> 21:06.558
None of them could escape.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.325
Good.

21:09.425 --> 21:11.392
What about my Alps?

21:11.458 --> 21:12.925
They are all dead.

21:13.792 --> 21:19.425
Both Alps and the Templars'
that the Grandmaster sent for precaution.

21:20.492 --> 21:21.658
They are dead.

21:23.725 --> 21:26.892
Well, well, Suleyman Shah.

21:26.992 --> 21:29.058
Your time is over.

21:30.725 --> 21:33.792
Do not tell anybody anything
about the Templars.

21:33.858 --> 21:35.725
Of course, Bey.

22:08.958 --> 22:10.858
Ayhan, did you hear something?

22:10.925 --> 22:12.825
No, why did you ask?

22:17.625 --> 22:19.525
You go, I will catch up with you.

22:19.625 --> 22:22.058
Ayhan, do not get yourself into trouble.

22:50.858 --> 22:52.392
Ertugrul Bey!

23:05.658 --> 23:08.458
-Ayhan Alp.
-Thank God you are alive.

23:08.558 --> 23:11.358
That bastard sent Suleyman Shah to exile.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.558
I know.

23:16.392 --> 23:19.025
-I have a request from you.
-Whatever you ask, Bey.

23:19.658 --> 23:22.092
I can give my life
for you and Suleyman Shah.

23:22.325 --> 23:23.725
Thank you.

23:24.725 --> 23:26.525
You will go to Kurdoglu.

23:27.592 --> 23:31.392
You will say "If you want Ertugrul...

23:32.058 --> 23:34.658
...he will come and surrender to you.

23:35.592 --> 23:37.025
However...

23:37.292 --> 23:39.525
...he has one condition.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.658
He wants a headquarters meeting.

23:41.725 --> 23:45.992
He wants to face you
in front of the beys."

23:46.058 --> 23:51.892
After that, if he still wants
and if he still has enough power...

23:53.458 --> 23:55.892
...he will take my head.

23:56.592 --> 23:58.725
Bey, what are you saying?

23:58.825 --> 24:02.092
He overthrew my father
with betrayal in his marquee.

24:02.325 --> 24:06.458
And I will take the throne back
in the same marquee by God's will.

24:08.392 --> 24:09.758
This is my plan.

24:13.025 --> 24:14.658
I want you to make Halime talk.

24:14.725 --> 24:16.025
Do whatever is necessary.

24:16.292 --> 24:17.958
Find out where the ark is.

24:20.058 --> 24:21.558
Yes, Bey.

24:23.392 --> 24:25.825
Go to Halime Sultan like this.

24:27.025 --> 24:30.825
So that she will see how serious you are.

24:42.892 --> 24:44.992
We are ready, Bey.
We can set off.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.058
Bring the Alps' corpses, Kutlu.

24:48.292 --> 24:52.458
Let us organize a funeral
worthy of their heroism.

24:52.525 --> 24:56.425
Let us read Quran and shed tears.
Let us grieve for them.

24:56.492 --> 25:01.592
Let our people see how right I was
to send Suleyman and his sons.

25:02.092 --> 25:03.758
Let them admire me.

25:04.592 --> 25:08.958
The pain of our lost Alps
will unite our nomad tent even more.

25:09.658 --> 25:11.492
What shall I do with them?

25:13.025 --> 25:17.425
Suleyman Shah and his family,
Wild Demir and his daughter...

25:17.525 --> 25:20.325
...feed wolves and birds with them.

25:22.292 --> 25:25.592
So that their rotten flesh
would be good for something.

25:28.058 --> 25:30.325
Turgut... Let us go.

26:01.925 --> 26:04.725
How could you let this persecution happen?

26:04.892 --> 26:06.825
How could you do this?

26:09.058 --> 26:10.925
They killed all of them.

26:10.992 --> 26:13.558
Yes. They all died
trying to rescue themselves.

26:13.658 --> 26:16.092
What did they do to our tent?

26:16.825 --> 26:19.825
Bey, they did not even have any swords.

26:21.558 --> 26:24.992
It was clear that it was going to be
like that. Look at our tent now.

26:25.058 --> 26:28.358
Everybody! Do not stay here!

26:29.091 --> 26:30.658
I said do not stay here!

26:30.725 --> 26:34.692
Do you not have any other thing to do?
I said do not stay here!

26:36.925 --> 26:38.558
Go away!

26:43.492 --> 26:46.058
It was clear that
Kurdoglu would not let them live.

26:46.292 --> 26:49.558
-He knew he would lose the throne.
-He did it because he was scared.

26:49.625 --> 26:51.525
-It is a shame.
-He killed the women.

26:51.625 --> 26:53.025
And poor Dundar.

26:53.292 --> 26:56.358
Do not talk here like this.
Somebody may hear.

26:57.292 --> 26:58.625
Here he comes.

27:27.658 --> 27:29.625
Bey, they are coming!

28:17.925 --> 28:20.025
This is his head stooge, Kutlu.

28:21.958 --> 28:23.492
Here we start.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.692
You know what to do, Ayhan.

28:28.758 --> 28:30.692
Do not worry, Bey.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.792
Hide a sword under my seat in the meeting.

28:33.858 --> 28:35.958
-This is what I want from you.
-I understand, Bey.

28:36.025 --> 28:38.425
I will take care of it.

28:38.992 --> 28:41.358
-May God help you.
-You too, Bey.

29:11.558 --> 29:15.658
Turgut Alp will take care of you
until you say where the ark is.

29:16.592 --> 29:21.592
So that you can find out
how Suleyman and his family passed away.

29:22.658 --> 29:25.058
God will punish you all.

29:40.725 --> 29:42.325
You...

29:43.992 --> 29:46.892
You were Ertugrul Bey's closest friend.

29:48.825 --> 29:50.625
You were his Alp.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.625
You were his brother.

29:55.758 --> 29:57.758
How could you do this?

29:59.358 --> 30:02.325
How could you kill those people?

30:07.992 --> 30:10.358
I can kill you too, Halime Sultan.

30:11.625 --> 30:13.292
Tell me where the ark is.

30:14.792 --> 30:17.892
I would not tell you
even if I knew I would die.

30:19.992 --> 30:22.058
If Ertugrul died...

30:23.492 --> 30:25.992
...I do not have a reason
to live on anyway.

30:26.792 --> 30:30.025
To kill me would be the best gift
you could give me.

30:37.525 --> 30:39.758
If you want your brother to live...

30:40.958 --> 30:42.825
...do not make me wait.

30:44.992 --> 30:49.092
They will let
neither me nor my brother live.

30:50.725 --> 30:53.892
Yigit will live my father's fate
even though he lives.

30:54.492 --> 30:56.892
It would be better for him to die.

30:57.558 --> 31:00.425
You will not hear even a word from me.

31:03.458 --> 31:06.592
Turgut Alp, have fun.

31:10.725 --> 31:13.392
Finish this before sunrise.

31:45.958 --> 31:47.392
Bey...

31:52.992 --> 31:54.758
What do you want, Ayhan?

31:55.925 --> 31:58.358
Ertugrul has something to say to you.

32:01.358 --> 32:03.958
What are you talking about?
Where did this come from?

32:04.292 --> 32:05.458
Where did he see him?

32:05.525 --> 32:07.658
Bey, we were patrolling with the Alps.

32:08.358 --> 32:10.358
He showed up suddenly.

32:10.425 --> 32:12.692
This is impossible.

32:12.792 --> 32:14.758
Do you hear what you say?

32:14.825 --> 32:18.592
Bey, he was very angry.
He put a knife on my throat.

32:18.658 --> 32:21.058
Talk! Talk, man!

32:21.458 --> 32:23.558
What does he want? Halime?

32:23.658 --> 32:27.025
No, Bey. He wants to confront you
in the headquarters.

33:01.525 --> 33:07.892
I am scared of neither you nor Kurdoglu.

33:22.858 --> 33:24.525
Get out.

33:24.592 --> 33:25.658
But, Bey...

33:25.758 --> 33:27.492
Get out!

33:30.792 --> 33:32.292
Get out!

34:19.992 --> 34:21.958
<i>I am not a traitor.</i>

34:22.025 --> 34:24.358
<i>I did not betray my ancestor Oghuz.</i>

34:24.492 --> 34:28.625
<i>The blood that spilled on my hands</i>
 <i>were for the future of Kayis.</i>

34:28.725 --> 34:32.058
<i>It was to be stronger, bigger.</i>

34:32.825 --> 34:35.525
<i>It was to have a land and to be powerful.</i>

34:35.592 --> 34:37.792
May I come in, Bey?

34:37.892 --> 34:39.525
Come in.

34:47.558 --> 34:48.825
You ordered me, Bey?

34:48.892 --> 34:51.525
You will go
to the Templars' castle secretly.

34:51.592 --> 34:53.558
You will tell them Ertugrul lives.

34:53.758 --> 34:56.891
-Yes, Bey.
-Come on, be quick!

34:56.958 --> 34:58.625
Wait.

34:59.792 --> 35:02.625
Get Ayhan Alp followed.

35:02.692 --> 35:05.425
He clearly has a trouble.

35:05.492 --> 35:07.658
I need to know every step he takes.

35:14.725 --> 35:21.458
<i>These ominous infidels</i>
 <i>could not just beat that son of Suleyman.</i>

35:21.725 --> 35:25.592
<i>But I will give him such a death...</i>

36:28.325 --> 36:29.725
May I come in, Bey?

36:29.792 --> 36:31.325
Come in, Karabudak.

36:42.958 --> 36:46.425
They beys and the people are anxious.

36:46.525 --> 36:49.058
The Alps are bothered.

36:49.292 --> 36:54.058
They go around saying
"How could we let such a thing happen?".

36:57.625 --> 36:59.592
They need to be eased, Bey.

37:00.425 --> 37:03.525
Otherwise, there will be
even more blood spilled.

37:04.558 --> 37:06.992
Be at ease, Karabudak.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.958
I know very well what I am doing.

37:10.025 --> 37:11.958
Send news to the beys.

37:12.025 --> 37:14.358
I want them to come to my marquee
in the afternoon.

37:14.425 --> 37:15.858
Yes, Bey.

37:39.058 --> 37:40.492
What do you want, Ayhan Alp?

37:40.558 --> 37:41.992
Do you want to die?

37:42.058 --> 37:45.592
Bey, I brought you
greetings from Ertugrul Bey.

38:14.525 --> 38:16.825
Where are these damn corpses?

38:43.425 --> 38:45.325
Suleyman Shah?

38:45.425 --> 38:48.758
What? You were not
expecting us, were you?

38:59.758 --> 39:03.825
Come on!
What are you waiting for? Kill them!

39:04.025 --> 39:07.658
-What are you waiting for? Come on!
-Do not bellow like an ox!

39:07.725 --> 39:09.625
Come and take our lives.

39:09.725 --> 39:14.492
Come here.
Come and learn by bitter experience.

41:09.858 --> 41:12.425
Forgive...
Forgive me, Suleyman Bey.

41:13.458 --> 41:17.658
It would be an insult to mercy
if I forgive you.

41:22.925 --> 41:25.358
Feed birds and wolves with his corpse.

41:25.425 --> 41:29.858
So that everybody sees what happens
to the ones who try to destroy Kayi.

42:33.592 --> 42:37.392
It is meaningless for me to live
when my Yigit has died.

42:39.025 --> 42:40.525
Kill me.

43:04.058 --> 43:07.958
I brought you greetings
from Ertugrul Bey.

43:09.858 --> 43:11.658
Everybody is alright.

43:12.092 --> 43:13.558
Do not worry.

43:17.958 --> 43:19.825
We will all be saved.

43:20.992 --> 43:22.725
Turgut...

43:22.825 --> 43:24.792
How is this going to happen?

43:25.358 --> 43:27.425
Let us be patient, sister.

43:28.492 --> 43:32.392
Ertugrul will save both us and the tent.

43:40.658 --> 43:44.658
{\an8}1 DAY AGO

44:35.658 --> 44:37.392
We will camp here.

46:59.758 --> 47:01.658
-Turgut!
-No! Father!

47:05.792 --> 47:08.058
-Turgut, do not do that!
-Father!

47:08.325 --> 47:10.525
Turgut!

47:10.592 --> 47:12.092
Turgut, do not do that!

47:12.325 --> 47:13.525
Turgut!

47:13.625 --> 47:15.092
Turgut, no!

47:16.358 --> 47:18.492
-Father!
-Turgut!

47:19.325 --> 47:21.425
At least, do not kill the women.

47:21.492 --> 47:23.492
It would be a shame. A sin.

47:23.958 --> 47:26.425
-Father!
-Turgut!

47:31.592 --> 47:33.992
-Turgut!
-No!

47:34.058 --> 47:35.592
Turgut!

48:26.525 --> 48:27.692
Wild Demir!

50:18.858 --> 50:20.992
Father! Gundogdu!

53:12.625 --> 53:13.658
Brother...

53:13.758 --> 53:15.292
My little brother!

53:24.092 --> 53:25.925
Father, where is Halime?

53:27.725 --> 53:30.092
Kurdoglu is holding her, son.

53:36.525 --> 53:38.025
Turgut...

53:38.992 --> 53:40.358
Turgut?

53:40.458 --> 53:42.492
Are you alright?

53:42.558 --> 53:44.525
Father, Turgut is...

53:44.625 --> 53:46.692
-Turgut.
-Turgut!

53:46.758 --> 53:48.792
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

53:50.692 --> 53:52.458
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

53:52.658 --> 53:54.892
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

53:54.958 --> 53:56.492
What is going on?

53:56.558 --> 53:58.358
-Turgut, son!
-What is going on?

53:58.458 --> 53:59.958
-Turgut!
-Bring some water.

54:00.458 --> 54:03.092
Turgut!

54:12.858 --> 54:15.625
I have to go to the tent immediately.

54:15.692 --> 54:19.525
Be patient. Let us talk about it first.

54:19.925 --> 54:22.625
There must be another way.

54:22.725 --> 54:24.392
Gundogdu is right.

54:25.092 --> 54:26.992
We must act reasonably.

54:28.025 --> 54:30.792
If we want to overcome this plague...

54:30.858 --> 54:33.325
...we cannot show weakness.

54:33.392 --> 54:35.658
You must control your anger.

54:41.925 --> 54:43.425
How is he?

54:44.492 --> 54:46.025
He is in so much pain.

54:50.392 --> 54:54.692
Kurdoglu brought him the drug
in the cage that Templars gave him.

54:55.525 --> 54:57.658
He did not drink it.

54:58.425 --> 55:00.392
He struggled with himself.

55:04.592 --> 55:06.892
If I ever catch you...

55:06.992 --> 55:08.858
Oh, if I ever catch you...

55:23.992 --> 55:25.825
Turgut.

55:25.892 --> 55:27.492
Ertugrul Bey.

55:27.558 --> 55:29.625
Do not get up. You are not well.

55:31.958 --> 55:33.958
We have to save the tent.

55:35.992 --> 55:37.958
I will not live any longer.

55:39.292 --> 55:43.592
At least, I would like to do
my last duty until I die.

56:33.892 --> 56:35.825
God, help my Turgut.

56:37.092 --> 56:38.958
Give him strength.

56:46.292 --> 56:47.592
Aykiz.

57:10.992 --> 57:13.492
If you die, you will be my pride.

57:18.358 --> 57:20.692
I will not have a man anymore.

57:22.292 --> 57:24.925
I will die with your memories.

57:27.358 --> 57:29.925
However...

57:31.425 --> 57:34.292
...I am begging you,
do not talk about dying.

57:37.292 --> 57:39.292
Neither to me nor to yourself.

57:44.025 --> 57:48.325
We will not let that ominous drug
to take over you.

57:49.692 --> 57:51.758
We will fight to death.

57:55.692 --> 57:57.692
The two of us, together.

57:59.492 --> 58:01.292
Do you understand me?

58:10.858 --> 58:12.858
I promise...

58:15.692 --> 58:17.758
...I will not surrender.

58:36.792 --> 58:43.792
{\an8}THE DAY OF THE MEETING

58:44.592 --> 58:47.958
This matter will be closed today
by God's will.

58:49.025 --> 58:50.925
Thank God.

58:50.992 --> 58:53.325
You have to be patient, Halime Sultan.

58:53.425 --> 58:55.558
Turgut, this is very dangerous.

58:56.558 --> 59:00.992
Ertugrul is alone, and you are still ill.

59:01.992 --> 59:04.725
We do not have any other choice.

59:21.392 --> 59:23.992
Ertugrul Bey sent you his greetings.

59:24.092 --> 59:28.092
Do not worry,
we will do whatever we can.

59:29.758 --> 59:31.425
Thank you.

59:32.658 --> 59:36.325
May God help us.

59:44.658 --> 59:47.558
Turgut!

59:50.092 --> 59:51.692
Turgut...

59:54.625 --> 59:55.725
Alright.

59:57.292 --> 59:58.725
I am alright.

01:00:07.058 --> 01:00:09.025
Come on, let us go.

01:00:24.358 --> 01:00:26.592
We do not have
any other choice, father.

01:00:26.658 --> 01:00:28.425
Kurdoglu must think we are dead.

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:31.492
This will increase
our possibility to succeed.

01:00:32.058 --> 01:00:35.792
If he finds out that we are alive...

01:00:35.925 --> 01:00:38.992
...he will let neither Ertugrul
nor Turgut live.

01:00:41.892 --> 01:00:43.825
My brother is right, father.

01:00:44.958 --> 01:00:48.758
We have to do this
before Kurdoglu finds out about the truth.

01:00:50.658 --> 01:00:54.592
We must convince him
to accept my participation to the meeting.

01:00:54.692 --> 01:00:56.325
What if he does not?

01:00:58.292 --> 01:01:00.858
Then, we will not have
any other choice...

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:03.358
...than going to all the Oghuz tents...

01:01:03.458 --> 01:01:06.958
...and look for brave men
willing to fight.

01:01:08.692 --> 01:01:11.792
None of us would accept
so much blood to be spilled.

01:01:17.425 --> 01:01:20.625
The beys would get themselves
out from this darkness...

01:01:20.725 --> 01:01:25.558
...when Turgut tells what he went through
in the castle and reveals Kurdoglu.

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:27.858
As my brother said...

01:01:27.992 --> 01:01:31.458
...none of us would accept
more blood to be spilled.

01:01:39.058 --> 01:01:41.692
I am also worried about Turgut's illness.

01:01:42.658 --> 01:01:46.058
Ertugrul, watch out for
both him and yourself.

01:01:48.025 --> 01:01:49.558
Alright, brother.

01:01:58.358 --> 01:02:02.725
Bey, Ertugrul walking around the tent
is not a good sign.

01:02:02.825 --> 01:02:04.058
Everybody is anxious.

01:02:04.325 --> 01:02:06.625
Nobody can know how this will end.

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:20.425
Suleyman and his family died.

01:02:20.492 --> 01:02:24.992
Are you afraid of Ertugrul
who is left by himself with only two Alps?

01:02:25.092 --> 01:02:27.758
We started this journey
for the sake of our tent's peace.

01:02:27.825 --> 01:02:29.825
We overcame so many challenges.

01:02:31.792 --> 01:02:36.392
And now you started getting scared of that
Ertugrul who does not know his place?

01:02:36.458 --> 01:02:38.625
Is this your notion of being a bey?

01:02:38.692 --> 01:02:40.958
Is this your notion of being a man?

01:02:43.558 --> 01:02:47.958
Is there anybody who has something to say
without getting ashamed?

01:02:48.025 --> 01:02:49.325
I asked a question!

01:02:49.392 --> 01:02:51.025
No, Bey.

01:03:04.558 --> 01:03:07.025
Ertugrul wants to come to the meeting.

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:08.825
May him come, then.

01:03:08.892 --> 01:03:11.025
And learn his lesson.

01:03:13.892 --> 01:03:18.658
I will say all his lies one by one
to his face...

01:03:18.758 --> 01:03:22.058
...and kill him with my own hands.

01:03:46.929 --> 01:03:49.296
What are you talking about?

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:53.829
They all escaped?

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:59.096
Yes, sir. Ertugrul saved his family
with Turgut.

01:03:59.729 --> 01:04:01.696
All our knights are dead.

01:04:16.362 --> 01:04:17.729
Get out of my face!

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:28.029
Stupid.

01:04:29.329 --> 01:04:32.396
I told you to kill him
when you caught him.

01:04:36.862 --> 01:04:39.796
God damn old man.

01:04:53.462 --> 01:04:55.729
Uncle, what are you doing?

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:03.362
I know you are a traitor
just like your father.

01:05:03.462 --> 01:05:07.629
I will kill you
like your sister and father.

01:05:09.462 --> 01:05:11.896
Take this bitch!

01:05:19.996 --> 01:05:23.029
God damn you. Suffer forever.

01:05:23.396 --> 01:05:26.562
-Sir, are you alright?
-Get out! Get out!

01:05:26.762 --> 01:05:27.962
Take her!

01:06:01.462 --> 01:06:03.029
We must tell the situation
to the Grandsmaster.

01:06:03.296 --> 01:06:05.062
The Cardinal's man Claudius
attacked us.

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:07.496
He saved Ertugrul and his Alps.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:10.996
Do not worry. I let him know.
He is about to come.

01:06:33.996 --> 01:06:35.596
Take the corpse away.

01:07:25.462 --> 01:07:26.896
Are you alright, sir?

01:07:26.996 --> 01:07:28.496
I am, Titus.

01:07:29.562 --> 01:07:31.296
Just a small wound.

01:07:31.462 --> 01:07:32.929
That is all.

01:07:34.996 --> 01:07:37.529
One of Kurdoglu's men is here.

01:07:37.596 --> 01:07:39.829
He confirmed what the knight said.

01:07:40.496 --> 01:07:42.796
Ertugrul is alive.

01:07:44.762 --> 01:07:48.462
He will go to the meeting
and confront Kurdoglu.

01:07:48.562 --> 01:07:52.562
No. Suleyman's rule is over.

01:07:53.729 --> 01:07:55.996
We must catch Ertugrul.

01:07:56.729 --> 01:07:58.296
What about Turgut?

01:07:58.729 --> 01:08:01.629
He is obviously with Ertugrul.

01:08:03.062 --> 01:08:05.329
How can this be possible?

01:08:05.496 --> 01:08:06.529
The drug...

01:08:06.629 --> 01:08:10.696
The drug is powerful, but...

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:14.296
...this is the power of faith, Titus.

01:08:15.662 --> 01:08:17.862
This is the power of faith.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:23.329
He will clearly die in a lot of pain
because he did not take the drug.

01:08:24.462 --> 01:08:30.396
But he can serve us the last time
before he dies.

01:08:32.562 --> 01:08:36.396
He can give us Ertugrul's head.

01:08:38.429 --> 01:08:42.362
Ertugrul wants to overthrow Kurdoglu...

01:08:42.929 --> 01:08:46.062
...with Turgut's testimony.

01:08:47.096 --> 01:08:52.429
He wants to take the throne back
in front of the beys.

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:57.362
Let us see who overthrows whom.

01:09:09.396 --> 01:09:12.529
-Did you bury the corpses?
-Yes, sir.

01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:14.929
Good.

01:09:15.662 --> 01:09:17.729
What about Arabi?

01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:21.529
He thinks I converted to Islam
and became his disciple.

01:09:24.929 --> 01:09:26.562
What about his ark?

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.396
I found out that it is in the nomad tent.

01:09:30.062 --> 01:09:33.296
I saved Ertugrul and his Alps
from the Grandmaster's knights...

01:09:33.362 --> 01:09:35.929
...in order to be able to take the ark.

01:09:37.996 --> 01:09:41.096
Moreover, I know
the Grandmaster knows this.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:47.029
My dear friend Petruchio...

01:09:47.896 --> 01:09:51.762
...so you hide information from me.

01:09:53.462 --> 01:09:55.029
That is all, sir.

01:09:57.429 --> 01:10:00.829
You are the best knight I have ever known.

01:10:01.796 --> 01:10:03.996
May God protect you, son.

01:10:14.529 --> 01:10:17.562
God will punish you so bad...

01:10:19.029 --> 01:10:23.762
...that you will pay the price
of the sins you committed.

01:10:46.062 --> 01:10:47.729
Turk!

01:10:54.662 --> 01:10:56.596
You will send a message
to Kurdoglu.

01:10:56.662 --> 01:11:01.362
Tell him that
we want Halime Sultan and Turgut.

01:11:01.962 --> 01:11:07.462
Tell Kurdoglu that all his family escaped.

01:11:08.562 --> 01:11:12.029
And that the two of them is behind this.

01:11:12.329 --> 01:11:17.296
Be quick. You must arrive
before their meeting.

01:11:18.562 --> 01:11:20.029
Go now.

01:12:20.496 --> 01:12:22.496
Jesus Christ...

01:12:22.596 --> 01:12:26.096
...help them in their fight
against the persecutors.

01:12:26.329 --> 01:12:28.629
Make Ertugrul gain a victory.

01:12:29.862 --> 01:12:32.829
Enlighten their way
with your divine justice.

01:12:55.996 --> 01:12:57.829
God, forgive my sins.

01:13:26.862 --> 01:13:28.329
Isadora?

01:13:29.496 --> 01:13:30.929
Isadora!

01:13:31.829 --> 01:13:33.529
Isadora!

01:13:34.696 --> 01:13:36.562
Isadora!

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:57.396
My beautiful niece
paid the price of her betrayal.

01:13:57.996 --> 01:13:59.862
Murderer!

01:13:59.929 --> 01:14:01.362
She was your blood.

01:14:01.429 --> 01:14:04.762
She was from bad blood.

01:14:04.829 --> 01:14:06.096
And she died.

01:14:06.796 --> 01:14:11.462
You have been given a last chance
to live, Shahzade.

01:14:12.629 --> 01:14:16.829
You will go to Konstantiniyye
with Cardinal Thomas.

01:14:17.596 --> 01:14:21.096
Otherwise, you will die like Isadora.

01:14:22.996 --> 01:14:24.596
Think thoroughly.

01:14:24.796 --> 01:14:27.696
I would rather die instead of serving you.

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:30.062
We will see...

01:14:30.329 --> 01:14:33.429
...how much longer
you will talk like that.

01:14:58.929 --> 01:15:00.562
Be very careful.

01:15:01.529 --> 01:15:02.762
The war begins now.

01:15:03.296 --> 01:15:04.496
Yes, Bey.

01:15:39.296 --> 01:15:41.862
Thank God you are alive.

01:15:41.929 --> 01:15:44.496
You made me so happy.

01:15:44.562 --> 01:15:46.896
We are all ready to die for you.

01:15:48.996 --> 01:15:53.029
Did Kurdoglu accept
confronting Ertugrul in the meeting?

01:15:53.296 --> 01:15:54.562
He did, Bey.

01:15:54.662 --> 01:15:55.896
I will go there.

01:15:56.829 --> 01:16:00.529
He promised that
he will be fair to you in the meeting.

01:16:02.896 --> 01:16:06.096
I am sure he will do
as much as he can for the sake of justice.

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:08.796
None of us wanted this happen, Bey.

01:16:08.896 --> 01:16:12.929
We are all ready to give our heads
for the sake of justice.

01:16:13.862 --> 01:16:15.696
Thank you.

01:16:15.796 --> 01:16:17.562
We do not doubt about it.

01:16:17.662 --> 01:16:21.062
You proved this
by coming here, anyway.

01:16:22.029 --> 01:16:24.662
May God protect our tent.

01:16:24.762 --> 01:16:25.896
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:16:25.996 --> 01:16:27.562
Amen.

01:17:03.529 --> 01:17:05.362
Come here, Halime Sultan.

01:17:10.562 --> 01:17:12.029
Sit down.

01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:15.462
May their hands break.

01:17:15.529 --> 01:17:18.929
That bastard Turgut
did so many bad things to you.

01:17:19.896 --> 01:17:23.296
First he beat you,
then he sent me to take care of you.

01:17:23.429 --> 01:17:25.529
Ugly face.

01:17:26.296 --> 01:17:28.096
No, I am alright.

01:17:29.296 --> 01:17:31.562
It is all because of Selcan Hatun.

01:17:33.362 --> 01:17:34.962
Hold on there, Eydis.

01:17:36.996 --> 01:17:39.362
What are you going to say?

01:17:41.462 --> 01:17:46.062
Whatever. She is dead now
with all her sins.

01:17:46.462 --> 01:17:48.796
It would not be appropriate for me
to talk ill about her.

01:17:48.896 --> 01:17:50.396
Say it, Eydis!

01:17:50.496 --> 01:17:52.329
Say what you have to say.

01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:58.362
She was such an ominous woman.

01:18:00.029 --> 01:18:06.829
When Alpargu stabbed
late Gokce Hatun on her groin...

01:18:07.496 --> 01:18:09.962
...she wanted to get her married with
Ertugrul Bey...

01:18:10.029 --> 01:18:13.529
...even though she knew
she was not going to have a baby.

01:18:14.396 --> 01:18:17.096
She gave me gold money
to prevent me talk.

01:18:17.729 --> 01:18:20.796
And I took them with these
ominous hands of mine.

01:18:23.096 --> 01:18:25.462
And that baby matter...

01:18:26.096 --> 01:18:27.829
What about the baby?

01:18:27.929 --> 01:18:32.496
I was suspicious of her pregnancy
in spite of being an infertile woman.

01:18:33.329 --> 01:18:37.329
And she whipped Aykiz
because she lost her baby.

01:18:38.762 --> 01:18:41.729
Anyway. God forgive her sins.

01:18:42.429 --> 01:18:44.629
Let me go if you are alright.

01:18:52.596 --> 01:18:55.596
There will not be peace
in a place like this...

01:18:56.596 --> 01:18:58.729
...where there are such sins...

01:18:58.796 --> 01:19:03.829
...and pathetic people like me
who do bad things for money.

01:19:05.029 --> 01:19:06.996
God forgive our sins.

01:19:20.062 --> 01:19:22.396
You cannot trust Kurdoglu's promise.

01:19:22.496 --> 01:19:24.829
We talked about this, father.

01:19:24.896 --> 01:19:26.962
He thinks all of you are dead.

01:19:28.496 --> 01:19:30.396
I have to do this alone.

01:19:30.496 --> 01:19:32.862
Ayhan talked to the beys
who are close to us.

01:19:32.929 --> 01:19:34.762
And with the Alps.

01:19:34.829 --> 01:19:37.862
Do not worry.
I will not be alone in the tent.

01:19:38.796 --> 01:19:41.896
Turgut will be waiting for me
in the marquee.

01:19:44.929 --> 01:19:47.929
If anything happens to me...

01:19:49.462 --> 01:19:51.096
...take care of Halime.

01:19:54.996 --> 01:19:56.529
Give me your blessings.

01:19:57.396 --> 01:19:58.796
You have it.

01:20:07.762 --> 01:20:09.562
May God protect you.

01:20:29.062 --> 01:20:30.896
Peace be upon you.

01:20:30.962 --> 01:20:32.396
And peace be upon you.

01:20:32.529 --> 01:20:34.396
Peace be upon you.

01:20:34.862 --> 01:20:36.929
Thank you so much.

01:20:37.029 --> 01:20:38.829
You sent help with Omer.

01:20:38.929 --> 01:20:41.329
Thank you, son.

01:20:42.096 --> 01:20:44.462
Where are you going?

01:20:44.529 --> 01:20:45.829
To the tent.

01:20:45.896 --> 01:20:48.096
I am going to take what we deserve.

01:20:48.396 --> 01:20:53.562
Stay on God's path,
and he will be with you.

01:20:54.762 --> 01:20:58.329
The victory belongs to God
even though our blood may be spilled.

01:20:58.462 --> 01:20:59.962
Hopefully.

01:22:09.329 --> 01:22:10.896
Excuse us.

01:22:26.829 --> 01:22:29.096
Turgut!

01:22:37.829 --> 01:22:40.062
Did Halime Sultan talk?

01:22:41.596 --> 01:22:43.329
Not yet.

01:22:44.596 --> 01:22:47.496
But she will.

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:49.829
Listen to me carefully, Turgut.

01:22:50.762 --> 01:22:54.062
I have a good idea to make her talk.

01:22:54.296 --> 01:22:56.696
You will take a walk with her.

01:23:02.429 --> 01:23:03.929
Go.

01:23:04.662 --> 01:23:06.429
Yes, Bey.

01:23:57.529 --> 01:23:59.462
Ertugrul warned me a lot.

01:23:59.962 --> 01:24:01.529
Also, you.

01:24:02.896 --> 01:24:07.062
All the things you said about Kurdoglu
turned out to be right.

01:24:07.329 --> 01:24:10.829
It was a big mistake for me
not to listen to him back then.

01:24:14.896 --> 01:24:17.862
He said he did not want justice
to be hurt.

01:24:17.962 --> 01:24:19.596
He was right.

01:24:20.729 --> 01:24:24.829
May the justice not be hurt.
We can accept to be hurt.

01:24:26.429 --> 01:24:29.396
May God protect us from the shame...

01:24:29.462 --> 01:24:34.929
...of forcing our children
live in a place where there is no justice.

01:24:41.296 --> 01:24:43.329
Everything will be alright.

01:24:44.062 --> 01:24:45.662
It is Friday today.

01:24:48.062 --> 01:24:51.062
God does justice to innocent people.

01:24:56.796 --> 01:24:59.029
May God keep you always with me.

01:25:21.096 --> 01:25:22.829
My girl...

01:25:25.062 --> 01:25:27.429
Do you need anything, father?

01:25:27.496 --> 01:25:29.362
Thank you.

01:25:29.429 --> 01:25:31.529
How is Gundogdu doing?

01:25:35.429 --> 01:25:38.396
He is trying to get rid of the
poison inside him.

01:25:38.462 --> 01:25:40.729
He will be alright in a few days.

01:25:52.529 --> 01:25:56.729
Selcan became a good daughter suddenly.
What do you say?

01:26:01.429 --> 01:26:07.729
She was disciplined by the situation
of first her sister, then her man.

01:26:10.396 --> 01:26:12.929
I hope you are right.

01:26:48.829 --> 01:26:51.329
Do you think he will recover?

01:26:51.396 --> 01:26:53.296
God knows.

01:26:53.429 --> 01:26:54.929
Let us pray.

01:26:56.596 --> 01:26:59.629
God, forgive me.

01:27:05.096 --> 01:27:08.662
You have to deserve to be forgiven first.

01:27:10.096 --> 01:27:12.396
How can I deserve that?

01:27:14.462 --> 01:27:16.062
My daughter...

01:27:16.329 --> 01:27:19.596
...if you want to deserve
to be forgiven...

01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:22.662
...you need to cleanse your heart first.

01:27:22.762 --> 01:27:25.396
The heart is our valuable asset.

01:27:26.496 --> 01:27:31.962
Our Prophet told us that
God says...

01:27:33.296 --> 01:27:35.996
..."The heavens and the earth
cannot contain Me...

01:27:36.062 --> 01:27:39.329
...but the heart of a true believer can."

01:27:39.462 --> 01:27:42.696
Therefore, this heart of ours...

01:27:43.462 --> 01:27:45.862
...is the biggest treasure of human.

01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:47.862
My daughter...

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:50.496
...if you wish to be forgiven...

01:27:51.062 --> 01:27:53.896
...be like Hazrat Khadija.

01:27:55.896 --> 01:27:58.596
Hazrat Khadija challenged
all the non-believers...

01:27:58.729 --> 01:28:05.029
...with our Prophet
when the spread of Islam began.

01:28:05.662 --> 01:28:09.696
She wanted to be the ointment
when his heart was broken.

01:28:10.462 --> 01:28:13.596
She spent her money
to spread her husband's cause.

01:28:14.096 --> 01:28:16.996
She believed him when others did not.

01:28:17.496 --> 01:28:22.796
She supported him
while everybody was avoiding him.

01:28:23.996 --> 01:28:28.896
And God granted our Prophet
children from her.

01:28:31.429 --> 01:28:35.362
Therefore,
let Hazrat Khadija be your guide.

01:29:10.896 --> 01:29:12.596
What is going on, Turgut?

01:29:12.696 --> 01:29:14.329
Where are we going?

01:29:14.962 --> 01:29:17.896
This is not good at all, Halime Sultan.

01:29:18.762 --> 01:29:21.362
Something is wrong.

01:29:31.696 --> 01:29:34.996
What is going on?
Where did we come here?

01:29:36.996 --> 01:29:41.396
We will go to the tent,
and you will go to the castle.

01:30:05.796 --> 01:30:07.029
Turgut!

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:25.770
God, help my son.

01:42:27.303 --> 01:42:30.603
Help him, so that
the persecution will be over.

01:42:31.037 --> 01:42:32.370
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:36.170
God granted him a conquest for sure.

01:42:37.303 --> 01:42:39.603
Our Prophet set off to Taif...

01:42:39.703 --> 01:42:42.503
...in order to find
a peaceful land for the believers...

01:42:42.603 --> 01:42:46.770
...when the persecutions of the
non-believers in Macca increased.

01:42:47.737 --> 01:42:52.637
Taif did not see the grace even though
there were high hopes about them.

01:42:52.803 --> 01:42:57.503
Our Prophet did not lose hope
when all doors were shut on his face.

01:42:58.670 --> 01:43:01.203
He struggles on
to make his cause be heard...

01:43:01.303 --> 01:43:05.270
...and to be able to make
even one person a believer.

01:43:06.170 --> 01:43:11.503
However, the people of Taif
threw stones at him. They persecuted.

01:43:12.570 --> 01:43:16.837
Our Prophet went outside Taif, wounded.

01:43:17.770 --> 01:43:19.770
Angel Jibreel showed up.

01:43:20.603 --> 01:43:24.637
He said they would destroy Taif
if our Prophet wanted.

01:43:26.137 --> 01:43:30.637
However, our Prophet
who was sent as a mercy to all creation...

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:35.070
...said "No, I do not want them
to be destroyed.

01:43:35.137 --> 01:43:39.603
I wish God brings up people
from their generation...

01:43:39.703 --> 01:43:45.037
...who will serve and pray
only to God, and not to others."

01:43:46.237 --> 01:43:50.137
The people of Taif
became Muslims years after that.

01:43:50.237 --> 01:43:52.570
Mercy prevailed over persecution.

01:43:54.103 --> 01:43:58.337
Hopefully, mercy will prevail
over persecution again.

01:30:50.708 --> 01:30:54.308
Our Bey is coming!
Our tent will be happy!

01:30:54.541 --> 01:30:55.674
Welcome, Bey!

01:30:55.774 --> 01:30:58.008
May God keep you always with us!

01:30:58.841 --> 01:31:00.841
Welcome, Bey!

01:31:03.074 --> 01:31:04.241
Welcome, Bey!

01:31:05.141 --> 01:31:06.908
Ertugrul Bey, welcome!

01:31:11.908 --> 01:31:13.874
May God help you, Bey!

01:31:17.174 --> 01:31:18.774
Welcome, Bey!

01:31:37.108 --> 01:31:38.674
Welcome, Bey!

01:31:52.741 --> 01:31:54.541
Ertugrul is here, Bey.

01:31:54.641 --> 01:31:57.041
So he comes.

01:32:06.574 --> 01:32:08.008
Welcome, Bey.

01:32:08.074 --> 01:32:09.241
Welcome, Bey.

01:32:10.041 --> 01:32:12.274
May God keep you always with us.

01:32:12.574 --> 01:32:14.641
Welcome, Bey.

01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:16.641
May God help you.

01:32:33.208 --> 01:32:36.241
Today is the day
to pay the price, Ertugrul.

01:32:39.208 --> 01:32:41.641
You are right, Karabudak.

01:32:42.174 --> 01:32:44.774
Today is the day to pay the price.

01:32:44.841 --> 01:32:49.041
Everybody will pay the price
in the Judgment Day.

01:32:51.141 --> 01:32:53.774
Thankfully, we have no doubt about it.

01:32:58.274 --> 01:33:00.608
However...

01:33:00.674 --> 01:33:03.908
...it would break my heart
for you and Kurdoglu...

01:33:04.008 --> 01:33:07.574
...to wait until the Judgment Day
to pay your price.

01:36:03.741 --> 01:36:05.574
Our condolences, Ertugrul Bey.

01:36:05.641 --> 01:36:08.541
Our condolences.
May God give you patience.

01:36:08.608 --> 01:36:11.808
Our condolences, Bey.
May God give you patience.

01:36:11.908 --> 01:36:14.074
Our condolences, Bey.

01:37:14.508 --> 01:37:17.608
I heard you wanted to
confront me, Ertugrul.

01:37:29.508 --> 01:37:32.974
As your loyal dog Karabudak said...

01:37:36.941 --> 01:37:39.208
...today is the day to pay the price.

01:37:41.308 --> 01:37:45.541
I will disregard
your father's holy memory...

01:37:46.774 --> 01:37:49.741
...and I will smash you here!

01:37:52.108 --> 01:37:53.741
Know your place!

01:37:59.308 --> 01:38:01.641
Ertugrul...

01:38:02.741 --> 01:38:06.407
Nobody recognizes you
neither in this marquee...

01:38:06.907 --> 01:38:08.774
...nor in this meeting...

01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:14.174
...or in any forage where oxen grass.

01:38:16.607 --> 01:38:21.441
I just accepted you in my marquee
out of respect to your father.

01:38:21.907 --> 01:38:23.907
If you cross the line...

01:38:24.141 --> 01:38:27.574
...you should know that
I will impale you in the tent square!

01:38:30.807 --> 01:38:32.607
Your loss and pain is big.

01:38:32.774 --> 01:38:38.507
However, if you have even a little respect
left for the people of this tent...

01:38:39.307 --> 01:38:41.674
...do not provoke disturbance.

01:38:42.507 --> 01:38:46.174
It was decided that
your family would be exiled.

01:38:47.441 --> 01:38:50.541
They were going to be sent
to your uncle Korkut's tent.

01:38:50.607 --> 01:38:56.941
However, your father and brother
chose to go against this decision.

01:38:58.774 --> 01:39:00.741
May them rest in peace.

01:39:00.807 --> 01:39:02.474
Amen.

01:39:03.807 --> 01:39:06.707
Now, say what you want to say.

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:10.707
And then, obey the decision
that will be given here.

01:39:12.607 --> 01:39:15.874
Are you planning to kill me
on the way...

01:39:16.174 --> 01:39:19.341
...by way of the Templars
that you have been allying with...

01:39:19.441 --> 01:39:23.341
...and with the Alps that you bought,
like you did to my family?

01:39:24.807 --> 01:39:26.541
What is going on?

01:39:28.707 --> 01:39:30.474
That is enough, Bey.

01:39:30.574 --> 01:39:33.874
This tactless man
has crossed the line way over.

01:39:37.641 --> 01:39:40.641
Now that Kurdoglu Bey
invited him here...

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:43.874
...let him talk, Karabudak.

01:39:44.541 --> 01:39:47.707
Now that this is the place
where God's justice will be done...

01:39:48.841 --> 01:39:51.741
...I say let us allow
Ertugrul Bey to say what he has to say.

01:39:51.807 --> 01:39:53.341
He is right!

01:39:53.407 --> 01:39:55.441
He is right.

01:39:59.341 --> 01:40:01.174
Thank you.

01:40:02.174 --> 01:40:08.807
The price for blaming a bey
in his marquee like this is very high.

01:40:13.207 --> 01:40:17.141
You will not get out of here alive
if you go on like this.

01:40:21.907 --> 01:40:26.374
You are not the bey of this tent,
Kurdoglu.

01:40:29.174 --> 01:40:33.841
You are a disgrace
to the people of Oghuz and Kayis.

01:40:36.774 --> 01:40:39.341
My words reflect the truth.

01:40:40.241 --> 01:40:43.474
I have two witnesses to prove them.

01:40:44.341 --> 01:40:48.674
I would like you Beys to allow these
witnesses enter the marquee.

01:40:49.507 --> 01:40:52.407
Let them come, Bey!

01:40:55.507 --> 01:40:57.741
Alright, then.

01:40:57.807 --> 01:41:01.841
However, I am sure
you also noticed that...

01:41:01.907 --> 01:41:04.541
...there are three beys missing here.

01:41:09.841 --> 01:41:12.574
They apologized from you.

01:41:21.274 --> 01:41:22.541
What is going on?

01:41:22.607 --> 01:41:23.874
What is going on?

01:46:19.623 --> 01:46:21.190
Brother!

01:46:23.490 --> 01:46:25.690
Halime Sultan, are you alright?

01:46:25.756 --> 01:46:27.356
I am.

01:46:27.656 --> 01:46:31.623
I am so glad to see you three
like this again.

01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:39.423
Turgut!

01:46:39.523 --> 01:46:41.556
Brother Turgut!

01:46:41.623 --> 01:46:45.990
-Brother, are you alright?
-I am.

01:46:46.090 --> 01:46:47.690
I need to go to the tent.

01:46:54.156 --> 01:46:55.490
Come on, brother.

01:46:59.423 --> 01:47:01.090
Come on, brother.

01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:14.256
Peace be upon you.

01:47:16.223 --> 01:47:18.090
And peace be upon you.

01:47:18.723 --> 01:47:22.156
I see that things went crazy
while I was away.

01:47:29.656 --> 01:47:33.556
Tell me, then. What did your witnesses
witness against me?

01:47:35.723 --> 01:47:42.123
That you allied with Black Toygar
and got the train raided.

01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:56.323
That you got fifteen of our Alps martyred.

01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:07.423
That you allied with the Templars and
brought all kinds of troubles in the tent.

01:48:12.723 --> 01:48:16.056
Enough is enough, Bey!
How much longer are we...

01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:27.056
That you went to the castle
a lot of times...

01:48:27.156 --> 01:48:31.090
...and committed crimes
with their Grandmaster Mancini.

01:48:41.123 --> 01:48:43.256
Well, well, well.

01:48:43.356 --> 01:48:46.523
Look how strong witnesses
my niece Ertugrul has.

01:48:48.056 --> 01:48:49.623
I do.

01:48:49.690 --> 01:48:55.190
They saw and heard in person
that you are a traitor, Kurdoglu.

01:49:00.156 --> 01:49:03.323
They will also witness that...

01:49:03.423 --> 01:49:07.756
...you bought men in the tent
with the gold you took from Mancini.

01:49:10.123 --> 01:49:16.090
They will tell who the bastards
you bought are one by one.

01:49:26.223 --> 01:49:28.590
Who is your witness?

01:49:28.656 --> 01:49:30.056
It is Turgut Alp.

01:49:31.123 --> 01:49:34.690
Do you think I do not know that
you and Turgut Alp killed my Alps...

01:49:34.756 --> 01:49:37.656
...who were taking your family to exile?

01:49:38.090 --> 01:49:40.390
Ertugrul Bey would never do that.

01:49:42.323 --> 01:49:44.623
Oh, Ertugrul.

01:49:44.690 --> 01:49:47.523
It seems like you underestimated Kurdoglu.

01:49:52.490 --> 01:49:55.990
They tried to set up a trap for me.

01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:58.156
They won Halime Sultan over.

01:49:59.256 --> 01:50:03.390
They are trying to ruin my reputation
with all kinds of slanders.

01:50:04.290 --> 01:50:08.323
But they do not know that
I will be the one who ruins them.

01:50:09.023 --> 01:50:11.423
There will not be an exile anymore.

01:50:12.656 --> 01:50:14.523
I will kill you all, Ertugrul.

01:50:14.623 --> 01:50:17.356
I will not let any of you live.

01:50:17.423 --> 01:50:22.256
I will kill your family even if they go
to the other side of the world!

01:50:22.323 --> 01:50:24.723
Alps! Catch him!

01:52:04.256 --> 01:52:08.323
I will kill you here
unless you confess everything.

01:52:08.723 --> 01:52:10.590
Talk, Kurdoglu!

01:52:11.623 --> 01:52:14.690
My beys, they are all lies!

01:52:14.756 --> 01:52:16.690
They are all slander!

01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:18.490
Do not be scared, my Beys!

01:52:18.556 --> 01:52:20.256
They are all lies!

01:52:22.590 --> 01:52:27.723
Kurdoglu, the truth came,
and the lies went away.

01:52:36.023 --> 01:52:37.990
-Turgut Alp.
-Yes, Bey.

01:52:38.523 --> 01:52:42.590
Send a message to Suleyman Shah
and tell him that he can come.

01:52:42.690 --> 01:52:45.456
-He can come to his marquee.
-Yes, Bey.

01:52:50.023 --> 01:52:54.490
I hope this holy marquee
does not have a shame like this anymore.

01:54:09.723 --> 01:54:11.656
Father...

01:54:12.156 --> 01:54:13.790
...the fire is lit.

01:54:25.356 --> 01:54:27.423
Ertugrul succeeded.

01:54:38.190 --> 01:54:40.256
Let us go, then.

01:54:43.656 --> 01:54:46.589
Hayme, you will catch up with us.

01:54:46.690 --> 01:54:48.323
As you wish, Bey.

01:54:49.623 --> 01:54:52.156
Abdurrahman, get the horses ready!

01:54:52.223 --> 01:54:53.790
Yes, Bey!

01:55:14.656 --> 01:55:17.123
<i>I swear by the name of God</i>

01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:22.256
<i>Who creates everything with one word</i>

01:55:22.356 --> 01:55:28.356
<i>And fills our hearts with faith</i>
 <i>I swear by my weapon, my flag</i>

01:55:32.623 --> 01:55:35.090
<i>In this path to war</i>

01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:39.090
<i>May my ancestor Hizir be my companion</i>

01:55:39.156 --> 01:55:41.590
<i>And Hazrat Ali my guide</i>

01:55:53.590 --> 01:55:57.423
<i>May Zulfiqar be my weapon</i>
 <i>And Duldul my horse</i>

01:55:58.456 --> 01:56:02.156
<i>May the dawn be ours</i>
 <i>And the victory be God's</i>

01:56:44.323 --> 01:56:47.356
-Welcome, Bey!
-Welcome!

01:56:47.523 --> 01:56:51.456
Welcome, Bey!
May God keep you always with us.

01:59:28.456 --> 01:59:31.190
Mercy...

01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:42.356
There is no mercy for traitors, Kurdoglu.
