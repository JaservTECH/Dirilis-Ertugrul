episode 9 will start at : 12:30

0:11:58.793 --> 0:12:03.093
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

0:12:03.922 --> 0:12:07.755
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

0:12:08.042 --> 0:12:11.109
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

0:12:21.330 --> 0:12:24.863
I am coming from the Kayi tribe.
Ertugrul Bey gave us your name.

0:12:26.663 --> 0:12:27.830
Ertugrul?

0:12:41.230 --> 0:12:42.430
Ertugrul.

0:13:15.430 --> 0:13:17.196
Why did you bring us here?

0:13:17.463 --> 0:13:19.730
Why are we not going
to the secret passage?

0:13:21.430 --> 0:13:23.130
Do not panic, brother Bamsi.

0:13:23.263 --> 0:13:25.630
This room was chosen
by our people on purpose.

0:13:25.763 --> 0:13:28.230
It is not a room that is used frequently.

0:13:28.830 --> 0:13:30.163
Shut up, woman!

0:13:31.863 --> 0:13:33.230
She fainted.

0:13:50.163 --> 0:13:54.430
With this woman, we can sneak through an
army of guards. Let us wear these clothes.

0:13:57.163 --> 0:14:00.730
Let us take a carpet out on the way
out so that we will not attract attention.

0:14:29.130 --> 0:14:30.296
Open the door!

0:14:30.830 --> 0:14:32.130
Open the door!

0:14:32.530 --> 0:14:35.296
-I am telling you, open at once!
-Are these your men?

0:14:37.896 --> 0:14:40.263
Open the door! I am talking to you!

0:14:40.530 --> 0:14:43.296
Open the door, then, brother Bamsi.

0:14:43.663 --> 0:14:45.830
Obviously, this is
the last day of his life.

0:14:46.130 --> 0:14:49.663
You are right, brother Dogan, he shouted
too much, he is giving me a headache.

0:14:49.926 --> 0:14:51.826
We have to cut off the noise.

0:14:52.496 --> 0:14:54.263
-I'm telling you!
-Great God!

0:15:30.596 --> 0:15:31.696
Bamsi...

0:15:32.763 --> 0:15:34.563
...we would harm our Bey like that.

0:15:34.696 --> 0:15:36.330
We do whatever he told us to.

0:15:38.530 --> 0:15:39.563
Bey...

0:15:39.696 --> 0:15:41.930
...will you go into
Nasir's trap knowingly?

0:15:42.230 --> 0:15:44.496
I do not want any objection
to my orders, Dogan.

0:15:44.596 --> 0:15:45.896
You shall do what I say.

0:15:46.430 --> 0:15:50.596
This is a big trap set up for not only
our tribe but for the whole Islamic world.

0:15:51.263 --> 0:15:53.696
We have break their game.

0:15:53.830 --> 0:15:57.930
Neither my life nor your lives
are important in a mission like this.

0:15:58.230 --> 0:16:01.863
Bring the woman who will take us to
the snake's nest, whatever it costs.

0:16:02.930 --> 0:16:04.230
Bey?

0:16:05.563 --> 0:16:09.696
Nasir will put his most trusted guards
here in order to catch me.

0:16:09.796 --> 0:16:12.196
This will make your entrance easier.

0:16:12.330 --> 0:16:15.130
While Nasir
enjoys the euphoria of victory...

0:16:15.263 --> 0:16:17.563
...you will take that woman out.

0:16:26.763 --> 0:16:27.830
Stop.

0:16:37.663 --> 0:16:39.363
Where are you taking these?

0:16:40.463 --> 0:16:44.130
His highness the Ameer and Leila Sultan's
governess Ummulhayr Hanim ordered us...

0:16:44.263 --> 0:16:46.496
...to change the carpets of
their living quarters.

0:16:46.630 --> 0:16:49.396
They told us to give away
the old carpets to those in need.

0:16:49.496 --> 0:16:51.496
Aleppo's poor people will pray for you.

0:17:03.630 --> 0:17:04.796
Carry on.

0:17:20.663 --> 0:17:25.230
Dogan and Bamsi came before us.

0:17:26.630 --> 0:17:29.563
We came with Ertugrul but...

0:17:34.130 --> 0:17:36.830
...my son Yigit and Turgut Alp...

0:17:38.563 --> 0:17:41.496
...could not reach Aleppo.

0:17:44.830 --> 0:17:47.230
They were captured by the Templars.

0:17:49.830 --> 0:17:52.296
-The Templars...
-Aykiz...

0:17:56.196 --> 0:17:58.763
I knew it. Turgut!

0:18:00.263 --> 0:18:01.596
Turgut.

0:18:04.763 --> 0:18:06.630
Turgut!

0:18:09.663 --> 0:18:12.896
Don't tell me that those traitors
beat us again, Nasir.

0:18:13.896 --> 0:18:16.296
No, your highness. We caught Ertugrul.

0:18:17.130 --> 0:18:21.396
He was put into the dungeon for killing
the witnesses in Sahabettin's trial.

0:18:21.630 --> 0:18:24.830
Do you think you can get
any information from Ertugrul?

0:18:26.763 --> 0:18:32.830
There is no power that can stand against
the absolute and swift justice of Aleppo.

0:18:34.696 --> 0:18:38.463
Ertugrul will see talking as
the only solution to save his own life.

0:18:46.463 --> 0:18:48.630
Why are you so tense, your highness?

0:18:51.896 --> 0:18:55.930
Traitors have suffered a great loss.
When we take Sahabettin in...

0:18:56.263 --> 0:18:59.530
...this network of traitors
shall be completely disbanded.

0:19:00.596 --> 0:19:04.296
For God's sake, while my uncle
roams freely in the city...

0:19:04.430 --> 0:19:06.296
...how can I relax, Nasir?

0:19:06.563 --> 0:19:09.396
You know how much the soldiers
are loyal to him.

0:19:10.230 --> 0:19:13.696
I do not want a discord in the army.

0:19:22.496 --> 0:19:25.296
Did you think that you can lie down
and rest in the dungeon?

0:19:25.430 --> 0:19:28.763
-We will clean you to the bone!
-Even your dog will not get your scent.

0:19:31.563 --> 0:19:32.563
Come on.

0:19:52.196 --> 0:19:53.930
Brothers, the woman woke up.

0:19:54.596 --> 0:19:58.396
Give it to me, Aykutluk Bey.
Let me take over.

0:19:58.930 --> 0:20:00.430
What is in it?

0:20:01.530 --> 0:20:05.363
What can it be, commander?
A carpet and some dust on it.

0:20:05.796 --> 0:20:09.396
There might be a female tick. The kind
that sticks and sucks your blood.

0:20:10.596 --> 0:20:11.896
Put the carpet down.

0:20:16.330 --> 0:20:18.430
-Shall I put it down?
-You suckling veal...

0:20:18.563 --> 0:20:21.263
...didn't our Bey tell us
to bring the woman in one piece?

0:20:21.363 --> 0:20:24.330
-But the soldier said put it down.
-I said put it down!

0:20:24.430 --> 0:20:26.563
Our Bey gave himself up for this woman.

0:20:26.663 --> 0:20:30.363
-Bamsi, you take the carpet and go.
-How is that possible, brother?

0:20:30.463 --> 0:20:31.763
Do what I say, Bamsi.

0:20:33.163 --> 0:20:34.563
Great God then!

0:20:40.196 --> 0:20:42.563
Have a good fight, brothers!

0:21:00.663 --> 0:21:02.830
I entrust Aykiz to you, Gokce.

0:21:03.463 --> 0:21:07.530
And I entrust both of you to first God,
and then to the bookseller.

0:21:09.230 --> 0:21:12.330
I need to inform Suleyman Shah
immediately.

0:21:12.930 --> 0:21:14.563
Do not worry.

0:21:15.363 --> 0:21:17.496
They are our lodge's girls from now on.

0:21:24.430 --> 0:21:27.896
Look, Gokce.
You are the only one with Aykiz.

0:21:28.763 --> 0:21:32.763
If I see you stand strong like this,
I will not worry about you on the road.

0:21:36.696 --> 0:21:37.863
We should go then.

0:21:59.930 --> 0:22:02.863
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS' CASTLE

0:22:12.730 --> 0:22:18.130
When Master went after you in a hurry,
I don't know how I completed the sermon.

0:22:32.396 --> 0:22:34.263
-Hold it straight.
-Okay.

0:22:35.330 --> 0:22:37.396
How did you manage to escape from there?

0:22:38.430 --> 0:22:42.830
While we were trying to save the wolf
from the trap, he saved us from there.

0:22:49.396 --> 0:22:52.396
Tell your infidel stories
to that black priest there!

0:22:54.696 --> 0:22:58.763
I don't care about the good tidings
of your father in the skies.

0:22:59.530 --> 0:23:02.930
Thank God,
I know both my father and my God.

0:23:18.230 --> 0:23:19.296
Pull.

0:23:27.230 --> 0:23:30.596
-In the name of Jesus!
-In the name of Jesus!

0:23:33.596 --> 0:23:34.730
Arrow.

0:23:40.796 --> 0:23:42.663
The Grandmaster is a clever man.

0:23:43.430 --> 0:23:45.696
He will make Yigit a Templar knight...

0:23:46.563 --> 0:23:48.563
...and use him against the Seljuk.

0:23:59.363 --> 0:24:03.296
What about the young man in the dungeon,
Afsin Bey? What will they do to him?

0:24:03.596 --> 0:24:06.230
I do not know what they will do to him...

0:24:06.796 --> 0:24:10.430
...but I hope we get out of here
before we witness that.

0:24:10.563 --> 0:24:12.830
Then, Yigit will not be affected so much.

0:24:13.263 --> 0:24:15.863
-With God's permission, Bey.
-With God's permission.

0:24:29.563 --> 0:24:30.696
Yigit!

0:24:35.796 --> 0:24:37.396
Let brother Turgut go!

0:24:37.530 --> 0:24:38.730
I said let him go!

0:24:40.730 --> 0:24:41.863
Enough!

0:24:49.263 --> 0:24:51.830
You carry the blood of
my father's murderers.

0:24:52.830 --> 0:24:54.763
You deserve to die.

0:24:56.363 --> 0:24:58.530
Be thankful that you are Yigit's friend.

0:25:00.930 --> 0:25:03.163
Shahzade's friend is our friend.

0:25:04.863 --> 0:25:06.330
Come on, Yigit.

0:25:08.496 --> 0:25:12.730
If someone from us killed your father,
he must have deserved it.

0:25:14.896 --> 0:25:17.830
Killing someone undeservedly
is not written in our book.

0:25:24.563 --> 0:25:26.830
My father respected your religion.

0:25:28.196 --> 0:25:31.530
He spent all his life in these lands
to understand the Muhammadans.

0:25:32.163 --> 0:25:34.630
If he was someone
who respected our religion...

0:25:34.863 --> 0:25:39.430
...search for his killers among people who
do not even respect their own religion.

0:26:17.663 --> 0:26:18.863
Are you ready?

0:26:19.596 --> 0:26:21.296
He will be ready soon, sir.

0:26:32.196 --> 0:26:36.163
I am guessing that we are acquiring
a friend from the enemy side.

0:27:31.296 --> 0:27:33.263
Please be rest assured, Hayme.

0:27:35.530 --> 0:27:42.263
With God's permission, our tribe has never
been left without a homeland or future...

0:27:43.196 --> 0:27:44.796
...and it shall never be.

0:27:45.696 --> 0:27:51.396
A long life that was spent on trying
to survive, in front of the Mongols.

0:27:54.163 --> 0:28:00.530
All the way from the Caspian Sea to here,
every homeland took a piece from me.

0:28:02.830 --> 0:28:05.230
Just like tearing my liver out.

0:28:07.130 --> 0:28:09.830
It tore out and took them.

0:28:13.730 --> 0:28:15.130
My father...

0:28:18.296 --> 0:28:19.663
...my brothers...

0:28:21.296 --> 0:28:22.630
...my sisters.

0:28:25.796 --> 0:28:27.230
Then...

0:28:28.630 --> 0:28:29.896
...my son.

0:28:32.596 --> 0:28:34.196
My Sungurtekin.

0:28:38.163 --> 0:28:40.530
I don't even know whether
he is alive or not.

0:28:45.196 --> 0:28:48.330
Trying to live on

0:28:48.396 --> 0:28:54.430
without knowing whether
my brave son is alive or not...

0:28:57.930 --> 0:29:00.163
As if these were not enough...

0:29:03.763 --> 0:29:05.263
...now Ertugrul.

0:29:08.396 --> 0:29:10.896
If anything happens to him...

0:29:20.430 --> 0:29:22.396
Thank God, Wild Demir is back.

0:29:23.396 --> 0:29:24.930
Come on, have a seat.

0:29:33.563 --> 0:29:34.730
Welcome.

0:29:36.530 --> 0:29:39.396
Thank you, Bey. Thank you but...

0:29:40.296 --> 0:29:42.396
...the news are not that good.

0:29:43.130 --> 0:29:45.296
Tell us then. Is Ertugrul alright?

0:29:49.863 --> 0:29:51.796
Is my brave son alive, Wild Demir?

0:29:57.196 --> 0:29:58.496
Wild Demir!

0:29:59.163 --> 0:30:00.630
Is Ertugrul alive?

0:30:03.296 --> 0:30:04.896
I saw him with my own eyes.

0:30:05.830 --> 0:30:07.230
He lives.

0:30:08.530 --> 0:30:09.696
But...

0:30:12.263 --> 0:30:14.263
...he is in the dungeon.
-What?

0:30:14.830 --> 0:30:16.563
What are you saying, Deli?

0:30:17.596 --> 0:30:19.396
Do you hear what you are saying?

0:30:20.630 --> 0:30:24.563
I wish I could beat my tongue
on the anvil but...

0:30:24.730 --> 0:30:26.363
...this is the truth.

0:30:32.430 --> 0:30:35.696
Rahman, go to the tribe
on the migration road immediately.

0:30:36.196 --> 0:30:37.430
Tell Gundogdu...

0:30:37.563 --> 0:30:41.563
...to take Kurdoglu and the other
Beys and come here in the quickest manner!

0:30:47.496 --> 0:30:48.696
Now...

0:30:49.863 --> 0:30:52.763
...tell everything
from the beginning, Wild Demir.

0:30:53.463 --> 0:30:56.163
Whatever you saw, whatever you heard.

0:32:21.663 --> 0:32:22.829
Did he talk?

0:32:25.363 --> 0:32:26.496
Pity...

0:32:29.463 --> 0:32:30.830
What a pity, Ertugrul.

0:32:32.396 --> 0:32:35.796
I feel bad seeing a brave man like you
being tortured like this.

0:32:37.196 --> 0:32:40.230
Atabeg Sahabettin, for the sake of whom
you suffered so much...

0:32:40.896 --> 0:32:43.796
...fooled not only you but all of us.

0:32:45.596 --> 0:32:48.396
But I see that
you are still under his spell.

0:32:51.230 --> 0:32:56.196
Who could think that Sahabettin Tugrul
would collaborate with those infidels?

0:32:57.830 --> 0:33:00.396
We were caught from
the least expected place.

0:33:01.663 --> 0:33:05.463
We are thankful to God,
who forced him to make a mistake...

0:33:06.563 --> 0:33:09.496
...and reveal how the Templars
nested in our palace.

0:33:10.196 --> 0:33:15.196
I hope you open your eyes before it is
too late and see what kind of a man he is.

0:33:16.330 --> 0:33:19.796
Are you going to open my eyes with
the stories you put El Aziz to sleep?

0:33:21.396 --> 0:33:23.530
You do not act wisely, Ertugrul.

0:33:24.230 --> 0:33:27.296
If you do not care for yourself,
at least care for your nomad tent.

0:33:27.896 --> 0:33:31.896
In this stormy winter, they are torn apart
in the migration journey.

0:33:32.663 --> 0:33:36.830
Yes, your tribe reached
the Aleppo borders.

0:33:38.430 --> 0:33:41.363
Settling in a new homeland
will depend on two words...

0:33:41.496 --> 0:33:43.896
...that will come out of El Aziz's mouth.

0:33:44.496 --> 0:33:48.863
His highness Ameer's only wish is
to see the so called uncle of his...

0:33:49.196 --> 0:33:53.730
...who collaborated with
the killers of his father, executed.

0:33:55.930 --> 0:34:01.163
If you correct your mistake
and hand Sahabettin Tugrul over to us...

0:34:02.396 --> 0:34:06.263
...I can weigh in on your behalf for
a decision on your new homeland.

0:34:07.163 --> 0:34:12.163
A land won by betrayal would not
be a home but only hell to Kayis.

0:34:35.863 --> 0:34:37.730
These fabrics are very nice.

0:34:38.696 --> 0:34:41.830
We should order a couple of
new dresses for you with these.

0:34:43.430 --> 0:34:45.430
We can also order one for Halime.

0:34:45.663 --> 0:34:48.430
It would be a present.
It would cheer her up.

0:34:57.363 --> 0:34:59.496
Look, Halime started to wake up.

0:35:15.796 --> 0:35:18.630
Get well soon. How are you?

0:35:19.830 --> 0:35:21.463
Do you have any pain?

0:35:21.863 --> 0:35:23.430
I am better, thank you.

0:35:25.896 --> 0:35:29.430
My name is Leila.
I am the Ameer of Aleppos's sister.

0:35:31.830 --> 0:35:33.430
So you are a sultan.

0:35:34.430 --> 0:35:35.563
Yes.

0:35:39.263 --> 0:35:40.396
How did it happen?

0:35:40.896 --> 0:35:43.163
We were ambushed on the way to Aleppo.

0:35:44.463 --> 0:35:46.263
I do not remember the rest.

0:35:46.430 --> 0:35:49.196
You are very lucky.
You were on the brink of death.

0:35:50.296 --> 0:35:52.663
The arrow hit you right above the heart...

0:35:53.130 --> 0:35:55.463
...and you are being treated
in the palace.

0:35:55.763 --> 0:35:58.296
Moreover, you are in my room.

0:36:02.530 --> 0:36:04.330
I wonder whose idea that was.

0:36:10.796 --> 0:36:12.163
Thank you.

0:36:12.330 --> 0:36:14.263
I am recovering thanks to you.

0:36:15.730 --> 0:36:17.930
I will never forget your good deeds.

0:36:19.830 --> 0:36:21.830
Did you come to our palace before?

0:36:22.730 --> 0:36:23.863
No.

0:36:24.930 --> 0:36:26.730
But I do not like palaces.

0:36:28.630 --> 0:36:32.330
I don't believe that anyone
can really be happy behind stone walls.

0:36:33.396 --> 0:36:36.863
I also did not believe that anyone
could be happy in this palace, too.

0:36:37.163 --> 0:36:38.530
And I turned out to be right.

0:36:39.363 --> 0:36:41.530
My uncle was the target of slanders.

0:36:42.796 --> 0:36:44.530
He had to run away.

0:36:45.263 --> 0:36:47.463
Now I do not even know where he is.

0:36:48.130 --> 0:36:50.830
This is why I like loneliness.

0:37:01.530 --> 0:37:03.763
Please do not take
her words personally, my girl.

0:37:03.896 --> 0:37:05.563
She does not mean bad.

0:37:15.830 --> 0:37:19.396
After her father and mother
were killed right before her eyes...

0:37:19.530 --> 0:37:21.463
...she shut herself in this room.

0:37:34.730 --> 0:37:36.496
I see that our patient has recovered.

0:37:37.730 --> 0:37:38.896
I am glad.

0:37:44.630 --> 0:37:46.630
Thanks to you, your highness.

0:37:48.196 --> 0:37:49.430
I am grateful.

0:37:49.730 --> 0:37:53.630
Actually, I am grateful to you
for dawning upon my gloomy castle's...

0:37:54.396 --> 0:37:56.430
...soulless rooms like sunlight.

0:37:59.863 --> 0:38:01.163
Leila.

0:38:01.663 --> 0:38:03.930
I see that you are enchanted as usual.

0:38:09.763 --> 0:38:12.396
I am in a good mood today,
my dear governess.

0:38:12.630 --> 0:38:16.430
Nasir has caught the goat herder
who abducted Sahabettin.

0:38:18.463 --> 0:38:20.296
Who was this brave man?

0:38:25.430 --> 0:38:27.563
A troublesome nomad from the Kayis.

0:38:29.830 --> 0:38:31.596
Kayi Bey's son Ertugrul.

0:38:36.930 --> 0:38:38.896
Halime? Halime, my girl?

0:38:39.663 --> 0:38:40.863
What happened?

0:39:10.636 --> 0:39:12.070
Continue until he talks.

0:39:13.270 --> 0:39:17.003
You will not even taste
the joy of rotting in Aleppo dungeons.

0:39:42.636 --> 0:39:44.170
Bamsi? Dogan?

0:39:46.670 --> 0:39:47.903
Bamsi?

0:39:49.903 --> 0:39:51.036
Dogan?

0:39:52.936 --> 0:39:54.503
Ertugrul Bey?

0:40:04.970 --> 0:40:07.136
Aykiz? My Aykiz.

0:40:08.770 --> 0:40:09.870
My Aykiz.

0:40:18.503 --> 0:40:20.570
Aykiz. Aykiz.

0:40:27.936 --> 0:40:30.603
Ustad, I congratulate you.

0:41:15.270 --> 0:41:16.636
My vizier?

0:41:18.970 --> 0:41:20.270
Thank God!

0:41:22.936 --> 0:41:25.970
I thank God, for letting me see you alive.

0:41:44.670 --> 0:41:45.936
My vizier...

0:41:48.003 --> 0:41:51.903
...what am I doing here?
What do these men want from me?

0:41:55.703 --> 0:41:56.903
Are they...

0:42:04.236 --> 0:42:05.670
Are you...

0:42:06.970 --> 0:42:08.536
...suspecting me?

0:42:12.236 --> 0:42:14.603
Do you think that I betrayed you?

0:42:22.570 --> 0:42:23.936
Now...

0:42:25.603 --> 0:42:28.670
...my eyes are open wide enough
to see the truth.

0:42:35.136 --> 0:42:38.570
If you even have
a doubt they I am a traitor...

0:42:39.736 --> 0:42:42.603
...if you have the slightest doubt...

0:42:44.236 --> 0:42:47.236
...kill me here at once without hesitation.

0:42:52.603 --> 0:42:54.703
I don’t care about your life...

0:42:55.803 --> 0:42:57.670
...or your death...

0:42:59.603 --> 0:43:04.736
...as much as I care about
a knot in this Turkmen carpet.

0:43:12.070 --> 0:43:14.936
Now, I am listening to you. Talk.

0:43:34.636 --> 0:43:36.970
Hasn’t this Turkmen goat herder
talked yet?

0:43:37.136 --> 0:43:38.836
Don’t let him die.

0:43:40.103 --> 0:43:42.970
Let me have some fun
while you eat your lunch.

0:43:47.170 --> 0:43:50.603
Do not die, alright?
Our fun is not finished yet.

0:43:51.203 --> 0:43:53.203
It is my turn to have fun.

0:43:55.970 --> 0:44:00.770
Just like the tick in the carpet found its
home, you found your home in this barrel...

0:44:00.936 --> 0:44:02.770
...you Turkmen goat herder.

0:44:22.136 --> 0:44:26.170
Tell me, Esma. Who else is a Templar
other than you in the palace?

0:44:28.603 --> 0:44:31.803
What is the goal of
the Templars within the Aleppo palace?

0:44:33.103 --> 0:44:34.803
I wish I die...

0:44:37.003 --> 0:44:43.203
I wish that you kill me as
I can’t bear the pain of you doubting me.

0:44:43.536 --> 0:44:45.003
Stop lying to me!

0:44:48.503 --> 0:44:50.036
Tell me the truth.

0:44:53.636 --> 0:44:56.003
Esma, why did you do this to me?

0:44:58.970 --> 0:45:01.536
My vizier, I did not betray you.

0:45:02.570 --> 0:45:06.003
I didn’t lie in the court,
when I testified against you either...

0:45:06.136 --> 0:45:08.103
...I only told what I saw.

0:45:08.903 --> 0:45:10.536
I beg you...

0:45:10.870 --> 0:45:14.003
I beg you,
please don’t treat me like a traitor.

0:45:14.236 --> 0:45:16.803
What did I do to deserve this?

0:45:27.736 --> 0:45:30.970
Who are the other Templars in Aleppo?

0:45:50.670 --> 0:45:52.703
How is your trade, Abu Hisam?

0:45:53.970 --> 0:46:00.703
Abu Hisam. I yearn for the day I’ll get
rid of this name and these Muslim attires.

0:46:05.036 --> 0:46:08.270
But the answer to your question
is positive, Nasir.

0:46:11.170 --> 0:46:12.570
Good.

0:46:13.470 --> 0:46:19.770
Anything that can be converted into money.
Mines, quarries, big fields...

0:46:20.270 --> 0:46:22.470
...we will own them all.

0:46:24.003 --> 0:46:25.770
Slowly, slowly.

0:46:28.770 --> 0:46:32.070
While El Aziz dreams about
swimming in pools of gold...

0:46:32.270 --> 0:46:37.136
...all the treasures of Aleppo will flow
into the cool cellars of our castle.

0:46:38.536 --> 0:46:43.270
Until his highness the Ameer turns into
a beggar who begs from the Templars...

0:46:43.936 --> 0:46:46.036
...we shall take everything he has.

0:46:46.203 --> 0:46:49.203
Then, I shall give you the good news.

0:46:52.003 --> 0:46:53.803
Ertugrul is in our hands.

0:46:57.670 --> 0:46:59.470
You will give him to me.

0:46:59.636 --> 0:47:02.603
You have to learn to be patient,
my precious friend.

0:47:03.236 --> 0:47:07.803
After we use that goat herder as a bait
to pull Sahabettin into our trap...

0:47:09.570 --> 0:47:11.636
...then Ertugrul will be yours.

0:47:28.603 --> 0:47:30.603
Do we have permission, Bacis?

0:47:30.803 --> 0:47:32.203
Please do not say that.

0:47:46.503 --> 0:47:47.970
My children...

0:47:50.503 --> 0:47:54.536
...how much you hurt inside
can be seen from the tears in your eyes.

0:47:56.470 --> 0:48:02.836
Not knowing the fate of those whom you
wait is eating your heart out like a worm.

0:48:04.603 --> 0:48:10.170
Your pain is big.
But big dreams require big sacrifices.

0:48:13.170 --> 0:48:18.603
Who sees the dream, Efendi?
Will Ertugrul and Turgut be sacrificed?

0:48:21.570 --> 0:48:26.536
Once upon a time, Abraham,
peace be upon him, wanted a son.

0:48:28.103 --> 0:48:30.836
He prayed to God over and over again.

0:48:31.603 --> 0:48:37.603
If he is blessed with a son,
he would sacrifice the boy for Him.

0:48:38.903 --> 0:48:45.603
One day, a little drop from the eternal
power of God fell on Abraham’s prayer.

0:48:46.670 --> 0:48:48.103
Ishmael was born.

0:48:50.070 --> 0:48:54.836
Then, one day Abraham saw a dream.

0:48:55.970 --> 0:48:59.203
In his dream he saw that
he was sacrificing Ishmael.

0:49:00.003 --> 0:49:02.536
He told this dream to Ishmael.

0:49:03.236 --> 0:49:08.836
A son is like an essence of the father.
Ishmael was a believer like his father.

0:49:09.036 --> 0:49:10.470
He accepted.

0:49:11.836 --> 0:49:18.270
He said, “do not feel despair, father.
Carry out your promise to our Great God.”

0:49:19.470 --> 0:49:25.236
As his heart rose with compassion,
as his soul got ripped apart with pain...

0:49:26.570 --> 0:49:31.970
...he put a knife on Ishmael’s throat
at a dark corner.

0:49:34.803 --> 0:49:39.136
Just at that moment, Gabriel came down
with a sacrificial ram on his lap.

0:49:40.503 --> 0:49:44.936
God is a witness to that you are one
who keeps his promises.

0:49:45.103 --> 0:49:49.470
Take that knife from Ishmael’s throat
and sacrifice this.

0:49:50.236 --> 0:49:51.770
Thank God.

0:49:56.603 --> 0:49:58.736
It is like this, my children.

0:49:59.470 --> 0:50:06.270
Those who dream big and keep their promise
need to be ready for big sacrifices.

0:50:07.536 --> 0:50:13.003
Ertugrul and his companions
are passionate to see a good dream...

0:50:14.070 --> 0:50:17.703
...for the Muslim world
who are living in a nightmare right now.

0:50:18.103 --> 0:50:22.936
That is why they put their throats
to the knife like Ishmael.

0:50:23.870 --> 0:50:26.903
Knife will not be hurt from them.

0:50:27.770 --> 0:50:31.036
We hope that God,
most Gracious and most  Merciful...

0:50:31.203 --> 0:50:33.970
...will not let those braves get hurt.

0:51:09.636 --> 0:51:11.270
You scared us, Halime.

0:51:12.736 --> 0:51:15.236
I am so sorry, governess.
I made you worry.

0:51:17.470 --> 0:51:19.936
When an ache struck like that
all of a sudden...

0:51:20.703 --> 0:51:21.970
Are you better now?

0:51:23.836 --> 0:51:25.603
I am better, thank you.

0:51:25.870 --> 0:51:27.736
Your father is here, outside.

0:51:30.803 --> 0:51:32.803
Stop. Don’t try to get up.

0:51:33.603 --> 0:51:35.670
Governess, let us invite him in.

0:51:39.703 --> 0:51:41.670
And I shall take some fresh air.

0:51:49.536 --> 0:51:51.036
Come in, Numan Efendi.

0:52:02.570 --> 0:52:03.770
My girl.

0:52:06.536 --> 0:52:08.203
Thank God I am well, father.

0:52:10.703 --> 0:52:12.536
-Father.
-Tell me, my girl.

0:52:13.670 --> 0:52:15.703
I am aware of what happened.

0:52:19.270 --> 0:52:21.836
I know what happened to Ertugrul, father.

0:52:23.803 --> 0:52:25.736
First Yigit, now Ertugrul.

0:52:28.270 --> 0:52:31.236
How will we get out of this bog we are in?

0:52:36.070 --> 0:52:37.470
My girl...

0:52:40.203 --> 0:52:43.103
His highness the Ameer would like to
see Numan Efendi.

0:52:51.036 --> 0:52:52.203
My girl.

0:53:08.503 --> 0:53:13.236
Your highness, when the whole Muslim world
was in the dark...

0:53:14.103 --> 0:53:19.136
...you rose up like the sun above Aleppo.
I am thankful to God for this.

0:53:22.170 --> 0:53:27.503
You are a ray of hope for not only this
city but for everyone who is oppressed.

0:53:27.803 --> 0:53:29.036
Don’t say that.

0:53:30.036 --> 0:53:31.736
Yes, your highness.

0:53:39.836 --> 0:53:41.069
Welcome.

0:53:43.670 --> 0:53:45.536
Come in, come close, please.

0:53:57.736 --> 0:54:00.503
You know how valuable
these prisoners are for us.

0:54:01.536 --> 0:54:02.770
Titus!

0:54:04.136 --> 0:54:07.936
Everything in this world will be over,
everything will be forgotten...

0:54:08.203 --> 0:54:10.103
...everything will be forgiven...

0:54:10.470 --> 0:54:12.736
...but I will not forgive you!

0:54:14.470 --> 0:54:17.236
I will never forget
what you have done to us!

0:54:18.136 --> 0:54:19.870
You lowlife dog!

0:54:25.736 --> 0:54:29.970
I wanted to introduce you to two of
the most precious persons of Aleppo.

0:54:56.236 --> 0:54:58.636
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

0:54:59.036 --> 0:55:01.003
And peace be upon you, Kurdoglu.

0:55:02.503 --> 0:55:06.103
God bless, I saw you standing up
straight like this...

0:55:06.236 --> 0:55:08.136
...I won’t care if I die now.

0:55:09.203 --> 0:55:10.670
Thank you, God.

0:55:11.203 --> 0:55:14.070
And you gave me the good news of
a grandchild, son.

0:55:14.203 --> 0:55:15.836
You made me happy.

0:55:23.670 --> 0:55:26.070
We are in a bind once again,
Suleyman Shah.

0:55:27.203 --> 0:55:30.270
-Rahman told us.
-I understand.

0:55:31.203 --> 0:55:33.803
What will we do, Bey?
What is on your mind?

0:55:34.236 --> 0:55:37.036
We are on a hair thick
Sirat Bridge, Kurdoglu.

0:55:37.203 --> 0:55:40.503
Without falling down to hell,
without giving or taking a life...

0:55:40.636 --> 0:55:42.203
...we have to solve this.

0:55:42.970 --> 0:55:45.136
Why did they imprison my brother?

0:55:45.936 --> 0:55:49.570
It is a game of these Crusader infidels.

0:55:50.603 --> 0:55:52.770
Templars have infiltrated everywhere.

0:55:52.936 --> 0:55:56.070
Then we should go and
bring down the sky on top of them.

0:55:56.236 --> 0:55:59.536
So many Alps have become martyrs
because of these infidels.

0:55:59.703 --> 0:56:03.236
Our tribe got scattered.
We almost went to war with Karatoygar.

0:56:03.970 --> 0:56:06.703
We won’t find peace until
we finish them all.

0:56:07.903 --> 0:56:12.636
But Gundogdu, there tribe is on migration.
We are not ready for a war.

0:56:13.836 --> 0:56:16.570
I told you that Aleppo would be our grave.

0:56:16.870 --> 0:56:20.803
Do not worry, Kurdoglu.
Someone from our blood would come and...

0:56:21.203 --> 0:56:23.236
...take our graves from here.

0:56:27.470 --> 0:56:29.170
Now, listen to me closely.

0:56:30.103 --> 0:56:33.136
Another valuable friend of mine
whom I want you to meet it...

0:56:33.203 --> 0:56:34.203
Open the door!

0:56:35.203 --> 0:56:36.703
Your highness Ameer.

0:56:44.103 --> 0:56:48.270
What kind of an imprudence is this?
What do you think you are doing?

0:56:50.270 --> 0:56:54.903
Nasir, I am hoping that you will give a
suitable punishment to this tactless man.

0:56:55.470 --> 0:56:59.570
-Of course.
-We have received a critical information...

0:56:59.770 --> 0:57:03.236
...about a topic Commander Nasir
has ordered to gather intelligence.

0:57:03.903 --> 0:57:07.236
That is why I had to barge in.
I beg for your forgiveness.

0:57:10.636 --> 0:57:14.970
Commander, as per your order, we looked
everywhere and we are now sure that...

0:57:15.170 --> 0:57:18.203
...servant Esma has been kidnapped
from the palace.

0:57:18.970 --> 0:57:20.270
I don’t understand.

0:57:26.270 --> 0:57:27.636
Nasir?

0:57:33.570 --> 0:57:35.070
If it comes to it...

0:57:35.270 --> 0:57:42.270
...you shall break every door in Aleppo,
search everywhere and find Esma, Nasir.

0:57:43.603 --> 0:57:45.703
I mean, right now.

0:57:53.636 --> 0:57:58.170
Tomorrow we shall go to Aleppo. We will
either get our homeland from there...

0:57:58.503 --> 0:58:01.870
...or we will die! There is no other way.

0:58:03.236 --> 0:58:04.736
What about Ertugrul?

0:58:05.070 --> 0:58:07.203
We do not know what he is accused of.

0:58:07.703 --> 0:58:09.870
We shall learn and act accordingly.

0:58:10.703 --> 0:58:15.036
Gundogdu, you shall go to
the moorland where we will settle.

0:58:16.103 --> 0:58:20.836
Have the tribe settle there but be ready
for a war that might start anytime.

0:58:22.903 --> 0:58:25.536
Wild Demir, you ready the weapons.

0:58:26.136 --> 0:58:27.270
As you wish, Bey.

0:58:48.536 --> 0:58:50.136
What will we do now, Nasir?

0:58:52.636 --> 0:58:54.170
What if Eftelya talks?

0:58:56.936 --> 0:58:58.903
You don’t know Eftelya, Titus.

0:59:00.103 --> 0:59:04.670
She would never do anything to harm
the Templars, you can be rest assured.

0:59:05.503 --> 0:59:10.036
You have still not learned that
you can never be sure about humans, Nasir.

0:59:12.236 --> 0:59:13.803
We cannot risk it.

0:59:15.803 --> 0:59:20.503
We should find Eftelya and bring her back,
whatever the cost.

0:59:21.636 --> 0:59:22.903
Dead or alive.

0:59:28.536 --> 0:59:31.970
We are almost sure that
she was abducted from the palace, right?

0:59:35.536 --> 0:59:39.036
Did something happen in the palace
that caught your attention recently?

0:59:42.536 --> 0:59:43.836
Think a bit harder.

0:59:45.070 --> 0:59:46.670
No. Nothing.

0:59:47.870 --> 0:59:50.170
We took Ertugrul and
put him in the dungeon.

0:59:50.503 --> 0:59:52.836
The rest was ordinary palace chores.

0:59:53.070 --> 0:59:54.470
What about before?

1:00:01.270 --> 1:00:02.270
Stop.

1:00:03.070 --> 1:00:04.603
Where are you taking these?

1:00:04.736 --> 1:00:08.670
His highness the Ameer and Leila Sultan’s
governess Ummulhayr Hanim ordered us...

1:00:08.803 --> 1:00:10.770
...to change the carpets of the Harem.

1:00:16.003 --> 1:00:17.070
Guard!

1:00:21.070 --> 1:00:22.703
Bring the governess to me!

1:00:31.103 --> 1:00:33.903
Nasir is looking for Esma
everywhere in the palace.

1:00:34.536 --> 1:00:36.636
He will be aware of her absence soon.

1:00:38.736 --> 1:00:39.903
Ertugrul...

1:00:44.470 --> 1:00:46.703
...they tortured him a bit in the dungeon.

1:00:53.236 --> 1:00:55.470
-You...
-My brother, don’t!

1:00:58.636 --> 1:01:02.470
We are not like them. We do not oppress.

1:01:07.003 --> 1:01:10.070
We do not owe our enemies
anything but justice.

1:01:17.036 --> 1:01:18.536
There is one more news.

1:01:21.103 --> 1:01:23.636
Some people came to the lodge
from your tribe.

1:01:23.770 --> 1:01:26.070
They said two young women and an old man.

1:01:26.203 --> 1:01:28.636
They asked the bookseller about Ertugrul.

1:01:33.870 --> 1:01:35.003
I am going.

1:01:38.703 --> 1:01:39.803
Nasir...

1:01:42.070 --> 1:01:44.636
...I told you to not to turn into
Karatoygar.

1:01:45.636 --> 1:01:48.070
But you are drowned
in courage of ignorance.

1:01:48.703 --> 1:01:51.870
I hope you can change
some things before it is too late.

1:01:59.803 --> 1:02:02.003
I give you my respects, Commander Nasir.

1:02:26.470 --> 1:02:28.270
What am I doing here, Commander?

1:02:31.270 --> 1:02:32.970
Are you interrogating me?

1:02:33.870 --> 1:02:36.270
How can I do such a thing,
Ummulhayr Hanim?

1:02:36.803 --> 1:02:39.803
You are the mother of this palace.
How can you say that?

1:02:41.236 --> 1:02:44.270
There is only one small issue
that caught my attention.

1:02:44.636 --> 1:02:47.836
-I wanted to consult you about that.
-Do ask, I am listening.

1:02:48.503 --> 1:02:54.503
Did you recently give an order to donate
the old carpets of the palace to the poor?

1:02:55.270 --> 1:02:58.736
We continuously donate the old items in
the palace to the poor...

1:02:58.870 --> 1:03:02.103
...but I have not given
such an order recently.

1:03:04.236 --> 1:03:06.270
Moreover, you know me, Commander...

1:03:06.803 --> 1:03:09.836
...I do the charity work by myself
without been seen.

1:03:12.170 --> 1:03:17.236
Of course we know this, governess. You are
the soul of Aleppo carved from a jewel.

1:03:19.470 --> 1:03:21.870
The protective wing of Aleppo’s poor.

1:03:24.170 --> 1:03:26.070
I am sorry if I disturbed you.

1:03:26.736 --> 1:03:28.003
Please.

1:03:28.570 --> 1:03:30.170
You can go back to your quarters.

1:03:54.503 --> 1:03:55.670
Guard!

1:03:58.636 --> 1:04:00.536
Prepare your regiment immediately.

1:04:09.470 --> 1:04:13.936
To a city where Ertugrul is in chains,
where even the Alps cannot escape...

1:04:14.036 --> 1:04:15.903
...how could you send Gokce?

1:04:16.903 --> 1:04:19.770
Selcan! Gokce volunteered to go.

1:04:20.736 --> 1:04:25.703
Have you forgotten that
our women are as brave as our men?

1:04:29.836 --> 1:04:32.903
Do not worry. Nothing will happen to them.

1:04:36.003 --> 1:04:41.470
Would Wild Demir leave them and return
if they were in an unsecure place?

1:04:42.103 --> 1:04:46.870
Mother Hayme, Gokce is my only companion.

1:04:48.536 --> 1:04:50.036
If she is gone as well...

1:04:51.003 --> 1:04:52.803
...how can I bear this pain?

1:04:53.670 --> 1:04:54.903
Do not fear.

1:04:57.703 --> 1:04:59.503
Selcan, look at me.

1:05:00.470 --> 1:05:03.103
Nothing will happen to them.
Do you understand?

1:05:06.570 --> 1:05:07.736
Do not fear.

1:06:00.203 --> 1:06:03.170
My vizier, you can tell
anything to this brave.

1:06:03.803 --> 1:06:06.903
He would even forget the message himself
after he delivers it.

1:06:08.470 --> 1:06:12.236
There are a few men that I trust in the
palace. You will tell them where we are.

1:06:12.603 --> 1:06:17.003
They will whisper our location to
Ertugrul and he can manage the rest.

1:06:18.936 --> 1:06:21.103
Come on, braves. Let us load the woman.

1:06:22.936 --> 1:06:24.136
Great God!

1:06:54.536 --> 1:06:56.136
Stop! What are you doing?

1:07:11.836 --> 1:07:15.603
We have to leave immediately. Wear
the guard’s uniform. We have to hurry.

1:07:39.936 --> 1:07:41.003
Stop!

1:07:54.003 --> 1:07:55.636
Where are you taking that?

1:07:56.803 --> 1:07:58.070
What is inside it?

1:08:00.870 --> 1:08:02.003
Put it down!

1:08:14.770 --> 1:08:16.070
Great God!

1:10:31.236 --> 1:10:32.570
Aykutluk.

1:10:33.736 --> 1:10:35.070
My vizier, you go.

1:10:35.936 --> 1:10:38.470
Vizier, you go, we will take care of him.

1:10:38.936 --> 1:10:39.970
Go!

1:10:41.936 --> 1:10:43.503
My vizier, please go.

1:10:43.669 --> 1:10:45.503
Vizier, go! Come on!

1:11:10.903 --> 1:11:12.036
This way.

1:11:12.669 --> 1:11:14.036
Go inside here, Bey.

1:11:39.803 --> 1:11:41.003
God damn!

1:11:42.470 --> 1:11:44.503
Guards! Guards!

1:11:50.036 --> 1:11:52.803
He shall not even stick
his nose out of the palace...

1:11:53.036 --> 1:11:55.536
...or I will have all of you executed,
understand?

1:11:55.836 --> 1:11:56.970
Go!

1:12:33.870 --> 1:12:35.070
Halime?

1:12:35.836 --> 1:12:37.670
Where is Leila Sultan, my girl?

1:12:37.936 --> 1:12:40.236
I did not see her this morning, governess.

1:12:42.570 --> 1:12:43.803
Where is she?

1:12:47.703 --> 1:12:48.836
Girls!

1:12:52.770 --> 1:12:57.636
Search the Harem immediately. Find Leila
Sultan wherever she is and inform me.

1:12:57.870 --> 1:12:59.070
As you wish.

1:13:02.270 --> 1:13:04.570
Governess, why did you get so anxious?

1:13:05.170 --> 1:13:10.770
His highness loves his sister very much.
He wants to know every step she takes.

1:13:12.203 --> 1:13:13.836
What am I going to do?

1:13:32.570 --> 1:13:33.970
This is all I can do, Bey.

1:13:34.170 --> 1:13:35.736
Go down this hall.

1:13:35.936 --> 1:13:37.936
It will take you to Nasir’s room.

1:13:38.203 --> 1:13:41.236
This is a very dangerous plan,
may God be on your side.

1:13:41.870 --> 1:13:45.003
-As Aykutluk said, you are a brave man.
-Thank you.

1:14:22.870 --> 1:14:25.736
You incompetent men. God damn you all!

1:14:45.736 --> 1:14:47.636
Sir, we found two guards dead!

1:14:48.203 --> 1:14:51.236
Get out!
Get out and find that man, get out!

1:15:06.770 --> 1:15:08.236
Did I make you angry?

1:15:08.770 --> 1:15:10.270
What do you want, Ertugrul?

1:15:10.570 --> 1:15:12.870
Everyone in Aleppo to know who you are!

1:15:13.836 --> 1:15:15.536
Then you have to kill me.

1:15:16.536 --> 1:15:19.503
Because nothing can break
the seal of my tongue.

1:15:21.803 --> 1:15:22.870
Why?

1:15:23.570 --> 1:15:26.970
Are you going to poison yourself
and die like a foaming rabid dog?

1:15:29.003 --> 1:15:30.636
I don’t think so, Nasir.

1:15:31.536 --> 1:15:33.170
You are a coward dog.

1:15:34.703 --> 1:15:38.870
You should see your own face. It is
as white as the shroud of the Sultan.

1:15:39.803 --> 1:15:43.536
You still don’t see
how powerful the force against you is.

1:15:45.003 --> 1:15:48.503
They will destroy you and
your reckless tribe to the last man.

1:15:49.770 --> 1:15:52.270
I am not in the least scared
of you killing me.

1:15:52.736 --> 1:15:56.803
I have seen the drooling bodies of your
dogs that were after me, so many times.

1:15:57.803 --> 1:15:59.270
I even lost count.

1:16:00.703 --> 1:16:04.236
I don’t think you are as devoted as
those dogs of yours, Nasir.

1:16:05.803 --> 1:16:07.736
When it comes to killing you...

1:16:08.503 --> 1:16:12.536
...one more or one less,
It makes no difference to me.

1:16:14.803 --> 1:16:17.036
Even if one hair of mine is damaged...

1:16:18.103 --> 1:16:22.703
...Shahzade’s daughter Halime,
for whom you went all into this trouble...

1:16:28.770 --> 1:16:30.770
Do you think we are stupid, Ertugrul?

1:16:30.970 --> 1:16:32.270
We know everything.

1:16:33.936 --> 1:16:35.836
If something happens to me...

1:16:36.003 --> 1:16:40.270
...Shahzade’s daughter Halime,
her brother who is our prisoner...

1:16:40.670 --> 1:16:42.570
...and your Alp Turgut...

1:16:42.803 --> 1:16:45.636
...may turn up dead.

1:16:48.736 --> 1:16:51.203
I already took my precautions, Ertugrul.

1:16:52.803 --> 1:16:56.236
I have so many men in this palace
who will take the life of Halime...

1:16:56.536 --> 1:16:58.536
...where Titus’ arrow had failed.

1:16:59.803 --> 1:17:02.470
I am not even counting
the ones in Kayi.

1:17:10.636 --> 1:17:14.770
What happened, Ertugrul?
Did you abandon the idea of killing me?

1:17:16.103 --> 1:17:17.570
Go on, kill me.

1:17:18.036 --> 1:17:20.736
Why did you stop? Kill me, Ertugrul!

1:17:23.603 --> 1:17:26.603
I will expose the people
who made you do this one by one.

1:17:27.670 --> 1:17:28.970
Then...

1:17:30.003 --> 1:17:34.170
...may God be my witness that I shall
kill you with my own hands, Nasir.

1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:37.933
Guards!

1:18:10.366 --> 1:18:11.600
Guards!

1:18:33.900 --> 1:18:34.900
Catch him!

1:18:35.300 --> 1:18:38.100
Don't let him escape! Bring him to me!

1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:48.733
I saw him, he is running away.
He went that way! Catch him!

1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:17.500
Please...

1:19:18.366 --> 1:19:19.566
...do not get up.

1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000
How is the sunlight of my palace?

1:19:32.333 --> 1:19:33.800
I am better, thank you.

1:19:34.900 --> 1:19:36.366
This is great.

1:19:37.033 --> 1:19:40.400
I talked with the physician as well.
He says that you are better.

1:19:41.466 --> 1:19:45.766
May God bless him.
He went into a lot of trouble to cure me.

1:19:47.900 --> 1:19:50.566
Governess Ummulhayr was always by my side.

1:19:51.333 --> 1:19:52.700
All thanks to you.

1:19:53.433 --> 1:19:55.833
I was waiting impatiently
for you to get well.

1:19:57.966 --> 1:20:02.766
I was waiting so that instead of talking
about health in this gloomy room...

1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:05.300
...we can walk in the gardens of Aleppo.

1:20:07.300 --> 1:20:10.733
And talk about nice topics.
Poetry for example.

1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:14.800
Do you like poetry, Halime?

1:20:17.700 --> 1:20:20.733
I would have liked to read you
some of the poems I wrote.

1:20:23.666 --> 1:20:27.866
As I am recovered now,
I will need to leave the palace soon.

1:20:30.333 --> 1:20:33.400
I would like to be with my loved ones
as soon as possible.

1:20:34.733 --> 1:20:37.800
Moreover, I have been a burden on
Leila Sultan for some time.

1:20:47.333 --> 1:20:49.466
Governess? Where is Leila?

1:21:29.033 --> 1:21:30.466
You are safe here.

1:21:31.300 --> 1:21:32.833
No one knows this hideout.

1:21:35.100 --> 1:21:36.366
Who are you?

1:21:37.833 --> 1:21:40.366
I am the niece of the man who you saved.

1:21:40.833 --> 1:21:42.366
Vizier Sahabettin's.

1:21:42.800 --> 1:21:44.566
So you are El Aziz's sister.

1:21:46.066 --> 1:21:49.066
I saw how you risked your own life
to save my uncle from...

1:21:49.433 --> 1:21:53.066
...the foolish decree of my brother.
I am not your enemy.

1:21:53.733 --> 1:21:56.500
It is unclear who is
a friend or foe in Aleppo.

1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:03.400
Only my uncle can save our city from
this state. That is why I am helping you.

1:22:04.833 --> 1:22:07.466
My uncle's friend is my friend as well.

1:22:07.866 --> 1:22:10.700
What if you are also a foe
who looks like a friend?

1:22:12.500 --> 1:22:16.400
Spend the night here. I will get you
out of here when the palace calms down.

1:22:19.666 --> 1:22:21.700
I don't think I have another choice.

1:22:33.533 --> 1:22:36.600
All the exits are blocked, sir.
We will find him sooner or later.

1:22:36.733 --> 1:22:40.000
Look in all holes, all cracks, understood?

1:22:40.566 --> 1:22:43.066
No one shall know
that Ertugrul has escaped.

1:22:44.033 --> 1:22:47.533
Especially his highness,
the Ameer El Aziz.

1:22:48.733 --> 1:22:49.866
Get out!

1:23:04.433 --> 1:23:07.633
I still see Ertugrul being taken
when I close my eyes, Aykiz.

1:23:10.666 --> 1:23:12.800
We have to find a way and reach them.

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:15.466
My Turgut...

1:23:17.466 --> 1:23:19.066
...if he is still alive...

1:23:21.100 --> 1:23:23.033
...only Ertugrul can save him.

1:23:37.066 --> 1:23:38.366
Dogan?

1:24:10.633 --> 1:24:11.966
Shall we pray, Yigit?

1:24:21.500 --> 1:24:23.400
I am going to ask you something.

1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:25.033
That man Turgut...

1:24:25.666 --> 1:24:28.633
...do you think he speaks the truth
about my father's death?

1:24:29.366 --> 1:24:30.666
He never lies.

1:24:34.333 --> 1:24:35.466
Alright.

1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:37.733
Now repeat everything I do.

1:24:43.500 --> 1:24:46.766
When you are going to pray,
go to your room and close the door.

1:24:46.933 --> 1:24:48.966
Pray to our Father secretly.

1:24:49.700 --> 1:24:53.300
Everything that is done secretly
shall be rewarded by our Father.

1:24:54.666 --> 1:24:57.700
Do not pray with empty words,
like the infidels.

1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:02.633
They only try to be heard with verbiage.

1:25:03.833 --> 1:25:05.433
Do not be one of them.

1:25:06.433 --> 1:25:10.600
Because our Father would know what we need
even before we say and bless it to us.

1:25:10.900 --> 1:25:12.300
Pray like this:

1:25:13.333 --> 1:25:16.933
Our Holy Father up in the sky.
Thou name shall always be sacred.

1:25:17.733 --> 1:25:18.833
Amen.

1:25:51.400 --> 1:25:52.633
Welcome.

1:25:52.966 --> 1:25:56.966
Why do you say welcome
as if we have good news to give them.

1:25:57.600 --> 1:26:01.400
Do not be agonized.
We know about the things that happened.

1:26:04.433 --> 1:26:05.800
So you know.

1:26:06.500 --> 1:26:09.833
We wouldn't have liked to
greet you with our heads down...

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.033
...but we faced many troubles.

1:26:12.433 --> 1:26:16.366
-Turgut Alp is our flesh and blood.
-I said I know what happened.

1:26:18.366 --> 1:26:20.766
We should talk about
what we need to do now.

1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:23.566
Aleppo has gone out of control.

1:26:24.666 --> 1:26:26.000
Vizier Sahabettin.

1:26:27.933 --> 1:26:29.400
He is a fugitive.

1:26:30.933 --> 1:26:33.900
We brought him here,
as the lodge was the most secure place.

1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:37.866
He needs to return to his post
for all the problems to be solved.

1:26:38.766 --> 1:26:40.700
How does this concern Turgut?

1:26:43.500 --> 1:26:46.800
As I said, Baci.
Here, everything is a tangled mess.

1:26:48.966 --> 1:26:52.800
But Ertugrul Bey has a idea
to put everything into order.

1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:57.300
And for this idea, he sacrificed himself.

1:27:31.866 --> 1:27:33.366
You must be hungry.

1:27:34.033 --> 1:27:35.933
You have to regain your strength.

1:27:41.733 --> 1:27:42.866
Thank you.

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.533
Please do not endanger yourself
for me anymore.

1:27:48.700 --> 1:27:52.733
I want my uncle to return to the palace
where he belongs, as soon as possible.

1:27:52.866 --> 1:27:54.033
That is all.

1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:57.400
The guards are still running about.

1:27:57.566 --> 1:28:01.700
Try to manage with this until the morning.
I will find a way to get you out of here.

1:28:01.900 --> 1:28:04.966
My problem is not getting out of
the palace, it is Nasir.

1:28:05.466 --> 1:28:07.966
He is the one who sold out
your uncle and us.

1:28:09.066 --> 1:28:10.533
Do you understand?

1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:33.366
In this cold weather, drink so that you
can warm up a bit, my son.

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:35.066
Thank you.

1:29:36.100 --> 1:29:40.833
With this holy duty, you deserve a place
in the heaven kingdom of our Father.

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.400
You come and drink some as well, my son.

1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:50.400
We have to show this sinner soul
that has collaborated with the devil...

1:29:50.566 --> 1:29:52.800
...the path of our Messiah, Jesus Christ.

1:29:55.533 --> 1:29:57.300
-Here you are, son.
-Thank you.

1:29:57.966 --> 1:30:00.833
Share with the others,
they should warm up a bit as well.

1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:02.600
May God protect you.

1:30:09.033 --> 1:30:10.700
My brave, how are you?

1:30:12.666 --> 1:30:14.300
Drink, drink up.

1:30:18.100 --> 1:30:21.766
I will get you out of here as soon as
possible, try to bear it, alright?

1:30:28.366 --> 1:30:32.500
Recite the patience invocation,
I promise that I will get you out of here.

1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:36.633
Don't. I won't leave Yigit to them.

1:30:37.300 --> 1:30:40.766
Yigit and you will go out of
this castle safe and sound, trust me.

1:30:42.433 --> 1:30:45.866
With God's permission, in this castle...

1:30:47.966 --> 1:30:49.666
...I will be a martyr.

1:30:53.433 --> 1:30:54.966
If the road takes you...

1:30:56.900 --> 1:30:58.333
...to my tribe...

1:30:58.833 --> 1:31:00.066
...to Kayis...

1:31:01.633 --> 1:31:03.100
...one day...

1:31:07.666 --> 1:31:08.933
...find Aykiz...

1:31:11.833 --> 1:31:13.366
...tell her that...

1:31:14.933 --> 1:31:16.333
...Turgut...

1:31:18.100 --> 1:31:19.666
...for even one second...

1:31:22.333 --> 1:31:23.700
...did not forget you.

1:31:26.666 --> 1:31:28.966
That I bore all the pain...

1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:34.833
...by thinking her love at all times.

1:31:40.100 --> 1:31:41.633
Find Aykiz...

1:31:44.900 --> 1:31:46.066
...and...

1:31:47.666 --> 1:31:49.766
...tell her that I love her very much.

1:31:52.866 --> 1:31:54.366
Alright, Alfin Bey?

1:31:55.433 --> 1:31:59.933
You will tell all these to Aykiz yourself.
I promise you, I will get you out of here.

1:32:02.766 --> 1:32:04.066
Drink some more.

1:32:18.066 --> 1:32:19.466
Recite patience.

1:32:19.833 --> 1:32:21.066
Patience.

1:32:28.866 --> 1:32:30.333
Dear God...

1:32:32.700 --> 1:32:34.033
Dear God...

1:32:34.700 --> 1:32:36.666
May God protect you, my sons.

1:33:13.933 --> 1:33:16.100
Ertugrul did what he always does again.

1:33:19.366 --> 1:33:20.600
Is it a lie?

1:33:21.433 --> 1:33:23.900
Ertugrul Bey messes everything up...

1:33:24.333 --> 1:33:26.366
...and you end up worrying for him.

1:33:26.500 --> 1:33:28.466
What should I have done, Hatun?

1:33:28.933 --> 1:33:32.700
Should I have said, nothing that happens
in the tribe concerns me?

1:33:33.466 --> 1:33:37.433
All I am saying is that you are being
the Bey of the tribe at the moment and...

1:33:37.566 --> 1:33:39.633
...that your father should know this.

1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:43.666
Will you abide them turning a blind eye
to whatever he does once again?

1:33:45.366 --> 1:33:49.333
Ertugrul should pay the price of
the damage he caused for these people.

1:33:55.566 --> 1:34:00.900
The great Kayi tribe. We don't have
a home, we don't have land...

1:34:02.300 --> 1:34:04.066
...we don't have plentiful food...

1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:08.900
...instead of thinking about these,
you still think of evil, Hatun.

1:34:09.900 --> 1:34:11.100
Is it a lie?

1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:13.833
As if these were not enough...

1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.033
...you stick your nose into things
that don't concern you even when pregnant.

1:34:19.300 --> 1:34:21.400
What more can I say to you, Hatun?

1:34:22.533 --> 1:34:23.833
What can I say?

1:34:56.733 --> 1:35:00.633
The letter you have written to
the Pope and Emperor Frederic...

1:35:01.733 --> 1:35:04.966
...is not an ordinary letter anymore,
Thomas.

1:35:07.033 --> 1:35:09.500
I was just thinking what you might give...

1:35:10.033 --> 1:35:13.500
...to see what I have written,
my dear friend Petruccio.

1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:18.866
You have learned our power.
Out network of spies...

1:35:19.933 --> 1:35:21.800
...our financial sources...

1:35:24.466 --> 1:35:28.066
...and the opportunities
we can present for a new crusade.

1:35:29.933 --> 1:35:32.900
Especially for you, my dear friend.

1:35:34.966 --> 1:35:37.100
What if you fail at the crusade?

1:35:40.033 --> 1:35:46.333
Would that be important after you became
the Pope, my dear friend Thomas?

1:37:11.900 --> 1:37:15.766
Yigit, listen to me very well.
You have to be very careful, alright?

1:37:36.466 --> 1:37:38.500
Did you understand what I said?

1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:42.533
You have to get that key from Marcus
at all costs.

1:37:53.533 --> 1:37:56.066
We will overcome and
solve everything, alright?

1:39:06.333 --> 1:39:07.700
You are a strong man.

1:39:08.633 --> 1:39:10.000
That is obvious.

1:39:15.533 --> 1:39:17.800
But you came out stronger than we thought.

1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:22.033
You did not collapse
after everything you went through.

1:39:25.733 --> 1:39:26.900
Well done.

1:39:30.933 --> 1:39:32.733
You are like a raging bull.

1:39:35.100 --> 1:39:37.466
Like a bull challenging his toreador.

1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:45.300
You are not very talkative...

1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:50.333
...but I can find a topic
that might interest you.

1:39:55.466 --> 1:39:56.566
Aykiz.

1:40:01.833 --> 1:40:04.333
The name you blabber while being tortured.

1:40:08.700 --> 1:40:10.000
Is she your lover?

1:40:19.566 --> 1:40:21.600
I don't think you will talk to me.

1:40:24.633 --> 1:40:25.833
Shame.

1:40:27.666 --> 1:40:28.966
Then I am going.

1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:34.500
What do you want from me?

1:40:37.700 --> 1:40:39.300
Your father's killer?

1:40:42.866 --> 1:40:43.966
My father.

1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:50.966
In this state?

1:40:51.866 --> 1:40:53.633
I cannot go into the dungeon...

1:40:54.466 --> 1:40:57.500
...but I know that there is a prisoner
in there called Giovanni.

1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:02.100
There is only...

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.100
...a Muslim man called Omer in there.

1:41:06.833 --> 1:41:09.333
I want you to ask something to that man.

1:41:09.633 --> 1:41:12.000
Whether she knows a girl called Isadora.

1:41:13.300 --> 1:41:14.966
If you can give me a reply...

1:41:15.500 --> 1:41:18.400
...I would do anything I can
for you to escape from here.

1:41:24.066 --> 1:41:25.866
How will I give you the answer?

1:41:27.366 --> 1:41:29.300
Shahzade Yigit will help us.

1:42:42.333 --> 1:42:45.433
Vizier is trapped. Turgut is far away.

1:42:45.700 --> 1:42:48.000
Ertugrul Bey is away in the dungeons.

1:42:48.766 --> 1:42:50.433
Aykutluk became a martyr.

1:42:51.433 --> 1:42:53.100
We are left all alone here.

1:42:55.833 --> 1:42:58.000
-Where are they?
-They are here, sir.

1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:29.800
Ertugrul?

1:44:19.466 --> 1:44:20.900
I am waiting outside.

1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:48.800
Vizier...

1:44:49.633 --> 1:44:53.800
...I know how much
you tried to help Kayis...

1:44:54.800 --> 1:44:56.700
...thanks to Dogan and Bamsi.

1:44:58.433 --> 1:45:00.933
They also told us
the conspiracy against you.

1:45:01.466 --> 1:45:03.566
If you find it suitable as well...

1:45:03.900 --> 1:45:07.000
...you should be taken somewhere
where no one can reach you.

1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:11.100
Let us take you to Kayi tribe.

1:45:12.433 --> 1:45:16.566
Not only the Templars, even if
the 70 kings of the Roman cities...

1:45:16.733 --> 1:45:20.000
...unite to attack us,
they cannot take you out from there.

1:45:22.533 --> 1:45:27.433
Suleyman Shah, your offer
made me more than happy but...

1:45:28.866 --> 1:45:34.633
...I am afraid to bring more disasters
to your already distressed tribe.

1:45:36.766 --> 1:45:39.966
Let disaster come to a brave,
while he is being brave...

1:45:40.566 --> 1:45:42.033
...it would be an honor.

1:45:45.366 --> 1:45:46.533
Rahman...

1:45:47.033 --> 1:45:48.566
...Ilyas Fakih...

1:45:50.433 --> 1:45:53.100
...take our vizier to the tribe
without attracting attention.

1:46:00.733 --> 1:46:03.800
Just like written
in the letter to the Jews...

1:46:05.300 --> 1:46:07.333
...in a way to please God...

1:46:08.333 --> 1:46:10.733
...with fear and respect...

1:46:11.733 --> 1:46:13.000
...let us pray.

1:46:17.333 --> 1:46:21.066
My holy brother, if you accept as well...

1:46:22.433 --> 1:46:27.800
...participating in a sermon by a monk
like you, who has devoted his life...

1:46:28.500 --> 1:46:32.733
...to the Messiah, would be
a great honor to all Templar knights.

1:46:57.766 --> 1:47:03.100
By sitting in the shelter of the Creator,
the One who has the power...

1:47:03.500 --> 1:47:05.800
...to do anything,
he takes refuge in His shadow.

1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:10.733
He is my shelter, my fortress!
I say for God.

1:47:12.566 --> 1:47:14.966
He is my God, I trust Him.

1:47:15.466 --> 1:47:21.366
Because He protects you from the traps
of the hunters and all deadly diseases!

1:47:22.533 --> 1:47:27.433
He takes you under His wings.
You take shelter under them.

1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:32.766
His loyalty becomes
your shield and shelter.

1:47:34.500 --> 1:47:35.800
Amen.

1:47:38.933 --> 1:47:40.300
Do not forget...

1:47:41.766 --> 1:47:45.466
...some non believers who reject
the Messiah Jesus Christ...

1:47:47.033 --> 1:47:49.466
...have secretly infiltrated amongst us.

1:47:49.966 --> 1:47:54.066
It has been written long ago that
they shall be tried!

1:47:56.900 --> 1:47:58.100
Amen!

1:48:32.966 --> 1:48:34.333
Nasir...

1:48:35.366 --> 1:48:37.033
...hasn't Esma been found yet?

1:48:37.433 --> 1:48:41.466
Your highness, most probably the Templars
who are collaborating with Sahabetttin...

1:48:41.633 --> 1:48:43.400
...have kidnapped her as well.

1:48:54.300 --> 1:48:56.533
Come with me, let us interrogate Ertugrul.

1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:19.566
When I think that my brother is in their
hands, I am about to lose my mind, father.

1:49:35.433 --> 1:49:36.666
Ertugrul?

1:49:37.833 --> 1:49:38.966
Halime?

1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.466
Leila, my girl,
what do you think you are doing?

1:50:18.666 --> 1:50:22.366
How can you help this man?
How can you bring him to this room?

1:50:22.733 --> 1:50:25.500
I had to.
They are looking for him everywhere.

1:50:25.766 --> 1:50:27.966
This is the only place
where I can hide him.

1:50:28.100 --> 1:50:31.866
That is what I was saying.
They are looking for this man everywhere.

1:50:32.466 --> 1:50:34.666
And you brought him to your own room.

1:50:35.433 --> 1:50:39.433
Did you ever think what would happen to us
if your brother finds out that he is here?

1:50:39.566 --> 1:50:43.100
If my brother finds out that he is here,
I would commit suicide.

1:50:44.733 --> 1:50:47.833
-Do you understand me?
-God, Great God.

1:51:03.066 --> 1:51:06.533
I am Kayi tribe's Bey Suleyman Shah.
I came to talk to you.

1:51:09.033 --> 1:51:13.400
As you took the trouble to come all
the way here, I am listening, Turkmens.

1:51:16.300 --> 1:51:18.900
Free my son whom
you have imprisoned unjustly.

1:51:20.900 --> 1:51:24.933
And rehabilitate the dignity of the Kayis
whom you slandered with plague claims.

1:51:25.566 --> 1:51:27.900
What would happen
if we don't do what you say?

1:51:30.933 --> 1:51:34.900
We would still settle
in the lands you had promised us before.

1:51:36.633 --> 1:51:38.866
But if my son Ertugrul is not freed...

1:51:40.033 --> 1:51:43.600
...while a tribe is being settled there,
a city would be burnt down here.

1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:45.666
Aleppo would be wasted!

1:51:55.433 --> 1:52:01.466
Alright, Suleyman Shah but what would
you do if I raise my army and come to you?

1:52:03.433 --> 1:52:05.533
Whom do you trust to talk like this?

1:52:08.066 --> 1:52:10.866
When you put us in the edge of
the Crusader countship...

1:52:11.066 --> 1:52:14.533
...we said yes putting our trust in Him
and we trust Him again!

1:52:16.066 --> 1:52:18.333
Do now forget, your highness Ameer...

1:52:18.700 --> 1:52:22.833
...us Kayis believe in God,
we trust Him and take refuge in Him.

1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.400
If your army is greater than Him, come.

1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:29.600
We shall be waiting in our tribe.

1:52:37.333 --> 1:52:38.500
Nasir...

1:52:39.433 --> 1:52:42.300
...if Sahabettin is with them,
our job is very difficult.

1:52:42.466 --> 1:52:45.600
Your highness, give me permission
to put them in their places.

1:52:47.700 --> 1:52:50.100
I want to be informed about
every step Kayis take.

1:52:50.933 --> 1:52:52.100
Alright?

1:52:53.400 --> 1:52:56.666
I have a feeling that
we can find my uncle if we follow them.

1:53:29.566 --> 1:53:33.366
The rear side of our Bey's marquee
shall always be protected strongly.

1:53:37.933 --> 1:53:41.533
The tents of the Alps shall be
distributed in the outer rings.

1:53:42.300 --> 1:53:44.866
We can make this flat area ahead
our training ground.

1:53:45.033 --> 1:53:49.066
The people have started to put up
their tents. Shall we wait for our Bey?

1:53:49.700 --> 1:53:52.466
We didn't come here
to scratch the soil, Alpargu.

1:53:52.700 --> 1:53:54.800
We will of course set up our tents.

1:53:56.033 --> 1:53:58.766
Make sure that your Alps are ready
at all times.

1:53:59.733 --> 1:54:02.466
An infidel might come out
from behind those mountains...

1:54:02.633 --> 1:54:06.500
...or an attack from our so called
religion brothers may come any minute.

1:54:06.966 --> 1:54:09.466
That is why you should be alert
at all times.

1:54:12.366 --> 1:54:13.533
Hatun...

1:54:14.966 --> 1:54:16.800
...you are carrying two lives...

1:54:16.966 --> 1:54:18.900
...put it down. We can carry them.

1:54:20.033 --> 1:54:22.100
There is still a long time, Gundogdu.

1:54:22.533 --> 1:54:25.900
I cannot sit around empty handed
while there is so much work to do.

1:54:55.333 --> 1:54:58.366
-Peace be upon you, Gundogdu Bey.
-And peace be upon you.

1:55:00.533 --> 1:55:02.900
God bless you all,
you have settled so quickly.

1:55:03.066 --> 1:55:05.433
Thanks to God, Fakih. Thanks to God.

1:55:07.033 --> 1:55:09.533
Aleppo vizier, Sahabettin Tugrul.

1:55:10.100 --> 1:55:12.333
Welcome, we are happy to see you.

1:55:12.633 --> 1:55:15.066
My brother Ertugrul
always spoke highly of you.

1:55:15.533 --> 1:55:17.366
Thank you, I am grateful.

1:55:17.966 --> 1:55:20.033
May your new homeland be a blessing.

1:55:20.366 --> 1:55:21.533
Thank you.

1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:22.933
Bey...

1:55:23.566 --> 1:55:26.500
...and about the identity of
the woman at the back...

1:55:26.633 --> 1:55:28.466
...we should ask the devil.

1:55:36.933 --> 1:55:38.066
Please.

1:56:05.033 --> 1:56:08.700
Shahzade, I will save Turgut from
the dungeon in the first chance I get.

1:56:08.866 --> 1:56:13.033
You stay in the courtyard or the corridor
in order not to attract attention, okay?

1:56:13.900 --> 1:56:15.666
We will have only one chance.

1:56:24.533 --> 1:56:28.066
God willing, you should not need
to use this but you should...

1:56:32.500 --> 1:56:34.066
...have it.

1:56:52.616 --> 1:56:54.316
What will happen now, Titus?

1:56:54.616 --> 1:56:57.450
Kayis came and settled
on the land without consent.

1:56:57.683 --> 1:57:00.216
Who will save us from the fury of Ustad?

1:57:01.116 --> 1:57:04.983
If you can get into El Aziz's mind and
make him do the things we want...

1:57:05.250 --> 1:57:08.483
...I know a way that would make
Ustad more pleased than ever.

1:57:08.650 --> 1:57:10.583
What is it, Titus? Tell me now.

1:57:11.716 --> 1:57:14.316
The girl El Aziz is in love with...

1:57:14.950 --> 1:57:18.150
If we can make her father
and El Aziz allies...

1:57:19.216 --> 1:57:21.983
...our Ustad's big plan
would come to life.

1:57:25.283 --> 1:57:28.650
Aleaddin Keykubat who will reject
this alliance can do anything.

1:57:30.350 --> 1:57:34.350
The sons of Seljuk and Saladin Ayubi's
children will fight, right?

1:57:39.050 --> 1:57:41.050
God, what a scene it would be.

1:57:50.083 --> 1:57:52.450
You do not understand
the gravity of the situation.

1:57:52.583 --> 1:57:55.383
The Templars' ears and eyes reach
inside the palace.

1:57:55.983 --> 1:57:57.283
You being...

1:58:12.350 --> 1:58:15.983
They might have whispered the Ameer
that you are a Seljuk Shahzade.

1:58:32.150 --> 1:58:34.016
I am glad you came, Nasir.

1:58:35.183 --> 1:58:38.383
-There are some things I want to ask you.
-Please do, your highness.

1:58:38.450 --> 1:58:40.350
I hope it is not something bad.

1:58:45.483 --> 1:58:47.183
Did you ever fall in love?

1:58:50.250 --> 1:58:51.516
No, your highness.

1:58:52.250 --> 1:58:54.083
I am only in love with my job.

1:58:56.150 --> 1:58:57.950
You are very boring, Nasir.

1:58:59.183 --> 1:59:03.116
As you have never been in love,
you wouldn't know what a lover should...

1:59:03.283 --> 1:59:05.550
...give the loved one as a present.

1:59:06.550 --> 1:59:09.016
I am drowning in my own problems
all alone.

1:59:10.483 --> 1:59:14.950
There are some issues I need to inform
you about. Issues of vital importance.

1:59:17.416 --> 1:59:20.750
How can you explain the interest
and affection they show you...

1:59:21.050 --> 1:59:24.616
...of those who are scared of giving us
a land due to plague claims.

1:59:26.650 --> 1:59:29.183
Ertugrul Bey, I understand your anxieties.

1:59:29.983 --> 1:59:32.616
But one of my children is in an unknown...

1:59:33.016 --> 1:59:34.283
...and the other...

1:59:40.083 --> 1:59:43.350
I do not have a refuge for
my child other than a prayer.

1:59:43.983 --> 1:59:47.116
If I do not do whatever
I can for the good of my daughter...

1:59:47.350 --> 1:59:49.650
...I cannot find peace even in my grave.

1:59:51.116 --> 1:59:53.283
Please, Ertugrul Bey, understand me.

2:00:15.416 --> 2:00:19.183
Ameer of Aleppo, his highness El Aziz
would like to see Numan Efendi.

2:00:20.416 --> 2:00:22.550
May it be a blessing, if God permits.

2:00:26.383 --> 2:00:27.483
Let us go then.

2:01:21.416 --> 2:01:24.383
-Our Shah is coming!
-Welcome, Shah.

2:01:25.116 --> 2:01:28.250
-Welcome, Bey!
-Welcome, Suleyman Shah.

2:01:46.050 --> 2:01:49.950
-Long live, Suleyman Shah.
-Long live, Bey!

2:02:35.250 --> 2:02:36.450
Great God!

2:02:36.750 --> 2:02:39.350
May you let our new land to be blessing.

2:02:41.016 --> 2:02:45.516
Bless us with Your mercy and have us see
Ertugrul and Turgut back in our tribe.

2:02:47.016 --> 2:02:50.316
May you make our sons and daughters happy.

2:02:50.483 --> 2:02:52.016
-Amen!
-Amen!

2:02:55.450 --> 2:02:56.583
Gundogdu...

2:02:57.750 --> 2:02:59.250
...inform all the Beys.

2:03:00.150 --> 2:03:03.016
-We shall have a meeting soon.
-As you wish, Bey.

2:03:03.283 --> 2:03:06.716
Invite the Aleppo vizier to my marquee.
I need to talk with him.

2:03:09.050 --> 2:03:10.316
Welcome, father.

2:03:12.450 --> 2:03:13.650
Thank you, my girl.

2:03:21.550 --> 2:03:24.683
-I have news from Ertugrul.
-Will he return to the tribe?

2:03:25.650 --> 2:03:27.250
His job is hard.

2:03:28.650 --> 2:03:31.216
After clearing the smear
that have been brought upon us...

2:03:31.616 --> 2:03:33.716
...he will return, with God's permission.

2:03:36.483 --> 2:03:37.616
Welcome, my girl.

2:03:41.583 --> 2:03:45.250
The troubles have formed a line
in front of us, what will happen now, Bey?

2:03:45.450 --> 2:03:48.550
Your eyes should be on the visitors
who came from Aleppo, Alpargu.

2:03:48.716 --> 2:03:50.450
They are a blessing for us.

2:03:50.683 --> 2:03:54.450
But first, we shall see what our Bey
will say in the headquarter meeting.

2:03:54.616 --> 2:03:55.950
As you wish, Bey.

2:04:19.450 --> 2:04:21.150
Welcome, Shahzade.

2:04:26.716 --> 2:04:28.750
I think there is a misunderstanding.

2:04:32.083 --> 2:04:34.016
Do not tire yourself out, Shahzade.

2:04:34.583 --> 2:04:36.383
I know all about your story.

2:04:38.450 --> 2:04:42.583
The Templars who are after you,
Sultan Aleaddin's wrath...

2:04:43.250 --> 2:04:47.350
...I know that you are running away from
the assassins who are trying to kill you.

2:04:49.483 --> 2:04:53.350
That is why I know that
you changed your identity as well.

2:05:00.950 --> 2:05:04.083
Thanks to Nasir's intelligence network,
I also know that ...

2:05:05.683 --> 2:05:11.083
...young Shahzade Yigit Alp
is a prisoner of the Templars.

2:05:12.416 --> 2:05:15.216
My offer to you will be short and plain.

2:05:16.350 --> 2:05:18.483
I am listening, your highness.

2:05:19.450 --> 2:05:21.750
In this fight against the Templars...

2:05:23.050 --> 2:05:24.483
...side with me.

2:05:25.316 --> 2:05:29.016
Having a Seljuk Shahzade on my side...

2:05:30.450 --> 2:05:32.150
...will open many doors.

2:05:33.650 --> 2:05:37.150
And I will prevent
the young Shahzade Yigit...

2:05:39.316 --> 2:05:41.450
...from growing up with the infidels.

2:06:16.483 --> 2:06:17.650
My Aykiz...

2:06:21.250 --> 2:06:27.116
...piece of my heart, look, if you try to
hold back your troubles inside...

2:06:28.350 --> 2:06:30.050
...you will eat yourself out.

2:06:30.983 --> 2:06:35.216
Instead of sitting down silently,
shout, cry, make a scene.

2:06:37.416 --> 2:06:39.183
Don't make your old man sad.

2:06:40.983 --> 2:06:44.350
From these Crusaders, we need
to take Turgut and Yigit back...

2:06:44.583 --> 2:06:46.683
...as well as our revenge, father.

2:06:48.416 --> 2:06:53.283
We have to make them live through ten,
1000 times more of what they did to us.

2:06:55.016 --> 2:06:57.750
We will find a solution
when Ertugrul comes, my girl.

2:06:59.016 --> 2:07:01.350
But I know how much you are hurting now.

2:07:02.050 --> 2:07:04.416
You want to turn the whole world into ash.

2:07:07.083 --> 2:07:08.316
But still...

2:07:09.183 --> 2:07:12.116
...do not plant seeds of hatred
in your heart, my girl.

2:07:12.250 --> 2:07:16.483
Despite all the evil in the world,
plant seeds of hope, my girl.

2:07:17.450 --> 2:07:20.283
Plant them, so that victory can be...

2:07:20.483 --> 2:07:22.450
...on the side of good and righteous.

2:07:25.183 --> 2:07:28.216
And always believe in God's justice.

2:07:29.416 --> 2:07:32.683
Of course those devils will
face a judgment day as well.

2:07:36.283 --> 2:07:37.683
I cannot do it, father.

2:07:39.083 --> 2:07:43.316
I am so angry that I cannot put out
the fire inside me.

2:07:45.250 --> 2:07:48.483
Cry, my girl. Cry, my girl.

2:07:49.183 --> 2:07:50.516
Cry.

2:08:06.983 --> 2:08:10.083
-Talk to me!
-We looked everywhere.

2:08:10.683 --> 2:08:12.450
We couldn't find him anywhere.

2:08:12.616 --> 2:08:15.483
There is no sign of Esma or Ertugrul.

2:08:16.450 --> 2:08:17.716
What about El Aziz?

2:08:18.283 --> 2:08:20.350
Did you make sure he didn't learn?

2:08:20.716 --> 2:08:23.450
Sir, we avoided giving direct answers
to his questions.

2:08:23.550 --> 2:08:25.183
-But...
-But what?

2:08:25.316 --> 2:08:26.583
Tell me, you fool!

2:08:27.150 --> 2:08:29.216
Sir, the governess made a scene.

2:08:29.350 --> 2:08:32.450
She shouted about that she had
something to tell to El Aziz.

2:08:33.050 --> 2:08:35.383
The Ameer heard her voice and took her in.

2:08:35.950 --> 2:08:38.250
You incompetent fools!

2:08:47.650 --> 2:08:49.216
Your highness, El Aziz.

2:08:51.683 --> 2:08:53.650
I don't know where to start.

2:08:56.950 --> 2:09:00.983
You know me, my only worry is my children.

2:09:02.150 --> 2:09:03.983
You and Leila.

2:09:06.016 --> 2:09:07.516
But, I am very worried.

2:09:08.383 --> 2:09:09.683
My governess...

2:09:10.516 --> 2:09:14.283
...your state of mind worries me too.
You were like a mother to me.

2:09:14.550 --> 2:09:17.950
Whatever that is worrying you,
please tell me directly.

2:09:18.616 --> 2:09:22.050
-That young man who abducted our vizier.
-Ertugrul?

2:09:23.416 --> 2:09:24.683
Yes, him.

2:09:28.183 --> 2:09:32.216
I was so happy when Leila
started go out of her room.

2:09:33.750 --> 2:09:35.083
But...

2:09:36.650 --> 2:09:39.116
...the last time
she returned to her room...

2:09:39.616 --> 2:09:41.350
...she came with that young man.

2:09:42.550 --> 2:09:44.550
How can that be, my dear governess?

2:09:53.516 --> 2:09:54.950
Guards!

2:09:56.016 --> 2:09:57.616
Bring me Nasir immediately.

2:10:05.683 --> 2:10:09.316
I am scared that something will happen
to my Leila because of that man.

2:10:09.416 --> 2:10:12.383
Do not worry, governess.
I can take care of this.

2:10:12.616 --> 2:10:14.483
We will learn what happened now.

2:10:30.350 --> 2:10:31.650
Halime Sultan...

2:10:32.716 --> 2:10:35.683
...you had said “my tongue only speaks
what is in my heart.”

2:10:36.416 --> 2:10:38.316
What kind of a tongue is this?

2:10:39.450 --> 2:10:42.283
While your heart
can't persuade your eyes...

2:10:44.383 --> 2:10:46.516
...how can your tongue persuade me?

2:10:50.716 --> 2:10:54.616
Neither my tongue nor my heart have
the strength to talk, Ertugrul Bey.

2:10:56.683 --> 2:11:00.383
I don't know whether I should be torn
apart from what we have suffered or...

2:11:00.483 --> 2:11:04.150
...how we made the ones who have extended
their friendship to us suffer.

2:11:26.983 --> 2:11:28.316
Halime Sultan...

2:11:29.083 --> 2:11:34.383
...it does not suit a Kinik girl like you
or a Kayi son like me to give up.

2:12:14.516 --> 2:12:15.950
Close the door!

2:12:39.650 --> 2:12:42.416
Open your eyes and
see what is happening around you.

2:12:43.216 --> 2:12:46.050
Look at the state you have
put yourself and Aleppo in.

2:12:46.683 --> 2:12:50.116
You are still not aware that you are
a toy in the hands of the Templars.

2:12:50.250 --> 2:12:52.283
You are a traitor, Ertugrul.

2:12:52.683 --> 2:12:56.350
A traitor who took advantage of my trust
and killed my soldiers.

2:12:57.216 --> 2:12:59.550
I will not let you deceive me once again.

2:13:09.350 --> 2:13:10.983
Come on! Hurry up!

2:13:23.683 --> 2:13:25.150
Break the door!

2:13:29.316 --> 2:13:30.583
Harder!

2:13:31.383 --> 2:13:34.083
Get out of the way!
Hit with the battering ram.

2:13:37.750 --> 2:13:39.050
Harder!

2:13:45.683 --> 2:13:47.050
Harder!
