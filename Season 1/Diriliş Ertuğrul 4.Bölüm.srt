episode 4 will start at : 12:35

0:12:25.866 --> 0:12:30.499
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

0:12:31.378 --> 0:12:35.012
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

0:12:35.339 --> 0:12:38.339
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

0:32:17.007 --> 0:32:19.007


0:12:40.906 --> 0:12:43.373
You will free Gundogdu, Karatoygar!

0:12:44.373 --> 0:12:46.173
Are you threatening me?

0:12:47.306 --> 0:12:49.573
If something happens to Gundogdu...

0:12:49.806 --> 0:12:52.773
...Ertugrul will take them outside
Seljuk territory.

0:12:53.506 --> 0:12:55.840
You will never find them again.

0:12:56.806 --> 0:13:00.506
Not you, not the Templars you work for.

0:13:14.240 --> 0:13:15.906
If you free my son...

0:13:16.806 --> 0:13:18.573
...I will take them to you.

0:13:19.240 --> 0:13:20.506
Where are they?

0:13:21.140 --> 0:13:23.806
Ertugrul is guarding them
so they don’t run away.

0:13:26.806 --> 0:13:28.940
If something happens to us...

0:13:29.606 --> 0:13:32.340
...Sultan Aladdin will be
informed of everything.

0:13:34.806 --> 0:13:38.340
Shahzade wrote a letter
about everything he faced in detail.

0:13:39.440 --> 0:13:42.573
How he was a captive
in Templars hands for months...

0:13:42.706 --> 0:13:46.640
...all the tortures he went through
for refusing to claim being the Sultan.

0:13:47.173 --> 0:13:51.140
How he never betrayed his state
despite the torture.

0:13:52.340 --> 0:13:54.840
How you cooperated with the Templars.

0:13:56.540 --> 0:13:58.540
In short, everything.

0:14:01.406 --> 0:14:02.873
The decision is yours.

0:15:13.240 --> 0:15:14.506
Father?

0:15:21.373 --> 0:15:22.606
My son.

0:15:25.606 --> 0:15:26.673
What happened?

0:15:26.806 --> 0:15:29.173
-Did you give the prisoners to Karatoygar?
-No.

0:15:29.306 --> 0:15:32.473
-Father?
-Karatoygar freed you.

0:15:33.906 --> 0:15:35.373
Go to the tribe.

0:15:36.906 --> 0:15:40.573
-Father, that man would not let you live.
-Do as I tell you, Gundogdu.

0:15:40.773 --> 0:15:42.140
Go now.

0:15:42.840 --> 0:15:44.273
Father.

0:15:45.373 --> 0:15:47.506
-Be quick.
-Go on.

0:15:49.806 --> 0:15:51.206
I said go!

0:16:09.640 --> 0:16:12.740
What happened, Akcakoca?
Is there someone inside?

0:16:13.306 --> 0:16:16.273
What is happening here?
What is this outrage?

0:16:16.440 --> 0:16:19.373
Get out of the way, Akcakoca.
We want to see who is inside.

0:16:19.440 --> 0:16:21.940
-What is it to you?
-I said get out of the way!

0:16:31.806 --> 0:16:33.640
The things we heard are true!

0:17:23.706 --> 0:17:26.406
Stop! Stop! Stop!

0:17:27.540 --> 0:17:29.540
What do you think you are doing?

0:17:29.740 --> 0:17:32.573
Our sons have died, Mother Hayme.
All because of them!

0:17:33.440 --> 0:17:36.373
They ambushed the caravan
but you hide it from us!

0:17:38.740 --> 0:17:41.540
So you violate our customs and our Bey.

0:17:41.640 --> 0:17:44.373
-Shame on you all!
-That is enough, Mother Hayme.

0:17:44.840 --> 0:17:48.240
You are saying customs but how many more
lives shall be sacrificed?

0:17:48.373 --> 0:17:50.206
Where are the bodies of our sons?

0:17:50.273 --> 0:17:53.773
-Where is Suleyman Shah?
-My son has died, not yours, Mother Hayme.

0:17:54.640 --> 0:18:00.440
Everyone in this tribe is my child,
my heart!

0:18:01.373 --> 0:18:05.673
A tribe can only stand strong
when they are united.

0:18:06.640 --> 0:18:11.340
If there is no unity, you would be
condemned to lose against the enemy...

0:18:11.473 --> 0:18:18.240
...and be wiped out! Has Suleyman Shah Bey
ever put his own live before yours?

0:18:20.740 --> 0:18:24.740
Has he ever put his own sons before yours,
has he ever chose a path other than...

0:18:24.873 --> 0:18:26.573
...the goodness of the tribe?

0:18:26.740 --> 0:18:30.773
Whatever he does, he does for the welfare,
for the future of the tribe.

0:18:31.240 --> 0:18:36.773
Breaking the unity of the tribe while
he is gone, to cry out mutiny...

0:18:37.173 --> 0:18:39.773
...is this what you see befitting
for yourselves?

0:18:41.240 --> 0:18:43.673
If you try to crush the customs...

0:18:43.806 --> 0:18:46.306
...you will be crushed one day.

0:18:47.206 --> 0:18:50.306
From now on, anyone stoning them...

0:18:50.540 --> 0:18:52.406
...would be stoning me!

0:18:53.173 --> 0:18:56.806
Anyone who faces them, would be facing me!

0:18:57.440 --> 0:18:58.906
Let this be known!

0:19:07.540 --> 0:19:08.806
Come, my girl!

0:19:27.606 --> 0:19:30.173
{\an8}KARATOYGAR INN

0:19:33.140 --> 0:19:34.906
They are playing with you.

0:19:36.606 --> 0:19:39.506
How did they learn our relationship,
Titus?

0:19:41.840 --> 0:19:43.440
Ertugrul.

0:19:44.306 --> 0:19:47.573
It was a matter of time for him
to connect the dots.

0:19:48.940 --> 0:19:52.573
God damn! I need to kill them all.

0:19:54.873 --> 0:19:58.906
What will happen to the letter
Shahzade wrote to the Sultan?

0:20:00.806 --> 0:20:06.473
My friends in the palace will make sure
that letter is not seen by the Sultan.

0:20:07.640 --> 0:20:09.240
I hope so.

0:20:27.573 --> 0:20:33.173
They will see who the game
and who the hunter is.

0:20:34.273 --> 0:20:37.740
God forbid, I was scared that
something may happen to you.

0:20:38.273 --> 0:20:42.140
If something happened to you,
what could I have said to Suleyman Shah?

0:20:45.340 --> 0:20:47.406
Stay here until they return.

0:20:47.840 --> 0:20:52.773
We can be companions while
waiting for our loved ones to return.

0:20:55.173 --> 0:20:59.273
With prayer, with belief, with patience.

0:21:06.940 --> 0:21:09.940
This tribe has survived through
so many hardships.

0:21:12.473 --> 0:21:15.873
All the pain is still here...

0:21:16.773 --> 0:21:18.473
...in my heart.

0:21:22.806 --> 0:21:27.906
God knows that I have never felt
so desperate in my life.

0:21:32.373 --> 0:21:34.140
My two sons...

0:21:35.273 --> 0:21:36.840
...my man...

0:21:43.306 --> 0:21:46.573
I lived through so many hardships
in this short life of mine.

0:21:47.640 --> 0:21:50.640
People who want to kill
my father and brother...

0:21:51.740 --> 0:21:55.673
...the states who wanted to use them
because they were Shahzades...

0:21:56.740 --> 0:21:59.306
...the nights we rotted in dungeons.

0:22:02.140 --> 0:22:06.173
I lived with the anxiety of losing
my loved ones every day I breathed.

0:22:09.773 --> 0:22:12.773
Ertugrul Bey woke us up
from that nightmare...

0:22:12.906 --> 0:22:15.206
...he put us in a beautiful dream.

0:22:16.606 --> 0:22:18.206
Mother Hayme...

0:22:19.773 --> 0:22:23.273
...I found the peace I yearned
for my whole life in your tribe.

0:23:00.506 --> 0:23:02.273
Your wish is accepted.

0:23:03.440 --> 0:23:06.306
Now it is my turn, Suleyman Shah.

0:23:06.307 --> 0:02:03.640


0:25:03.253 --> 0:25:06.720
Mother Hayme, why do you take
this ominous girl into your tent?

0:25:07.220 --> 0:25:10.253
Aren’t they the source of all problems
we are facing today?

0:25:10.686 --> 0:25:13.120
How can she have the face
to stay in our tribe?

0:25:13.253 --> 0:25:15.653
How can she sit in our marquee?

0:25:19.320 --> 0:25:22.386
How dare you question my decisions?

0:25:23.820 --> 0:25:26.053
Get out of here now! I said now!

0:25:29.120 --> 0:25:31.953
Beys, come on, let us talk inside.

0:25:33.653 --> 0:25:35.753
Everyone in the tribe is informed.

0:25:48.820 --> 0:25:49.986
What is happening?

0:25:50.086 --> 0:25:52.920
How dare you enter your Bey’s
marquee like this?

0:26:02.620 --> 0:26:05.120
They wanted to talk with their Bey,
Hayme Hanim.

0:26:18.886 --> 0:26:20.820
And I accepted their request.

0:26:40.720 --> 0:26:44.786
State comes first or
else you get eaten by crows.

0:28:48.953 --> 0:28:51.220
Walk. I said walk along!

0:29:15.753 --> 0:29:17.853
Whatever happens do not show yourselves.

0:29:17.986 --> 0:29:19.286
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

0:29:35.353 --> 0:29:36.353
Walk.

0:29:53.753 --> 0:29:55.720
Send the Shahzades, Ertugrul.

0:29:56.220 --> 0:29:57.853
And you send my father!

0:30:07.053 --> 0:30:08.053
Come on.

0:30:57.686 --> 0:30:59.086
Kill them all!

0:30:59.886 --> 0:31:02.920
Kill them all!

0:31:08.320 --> 0:31:11.386
What if Suleyman Shah does not come back?
What will we do, Bey?

0:31:11.820 --> 0:31:15.920
Bey, what can we do if this Karatoygar
is not satisfied attacks the tribe later?

0:31:32.853 --> 0:31:36.853
We see that the tribe has
so many endless problems.

0:31:38.953 --> 0:31:40.653
We did not know...

0:31:42.886 --> 0:31:46.153
...that the beys who have
many jobs to do are anxious to...

0:31:46.353 --> 0:31:49.253
...gather the headquarter meetings
every chance they get.

0:31:53.186 --> 0:31:59.353
For you to show your courage, you wait
for your Bey to sacrifice himself.

0:32:00.220 --> 0:32:03.853
We were not aware of this, until now.

0:32:04.686 --> 0:32:09.286
If Suleyman Shah who returned from
countless battles tired and sweaty...

0:32:10.086 --> 0:32:14.120
...saw you in this manner,
I am sure he would have been proud.

0:32:16.253 --> 0:32:17.820
Kill them all!

0:32:18.386 --> 0:32:20.053
Why aren’t you attacking?

0:32:20.353 --> 0:32:21.686
Why?

0:32:44.286 --> 0:32:45.686
Take them away.

0:32:46.020 --> 0:32:47.920
I told you to kill them all!

0:32:48.053 --> 0:32:49.386
Kill them all!

0:32:54.953 --> 0:32:57.653
This is treachery! Treachery!

0:32:58.886 --> 0:33:02.786
You cowards! You will pay for all this!

0:33:05.853 --> 0:33:07.053
Attack!

0:34:03.020 --> 0:34:06.253
Your brother is still in my hand,
Ertugrul!

0:34:07.186 --> 0:34:09.286
If something happens to me...

0:34:09.653 --> 0:34:11.320
Save your breath, Karatoygar.

0:34:11.820 --> 0:34:13.420
No one will come to your help.

0:34:13.686 --> 0:34:15.986
I want to talk with you alone,
Ertugrul Bey.

0:34:16.620 --> 0:34:17.986
Leave us alone, Alps.

0:34:33.753 --> 0:34:36.720
I was a commander in the Seljuk army
for years.

0:34:37.286 --> 0:34:41.220
For the Great Seljuk state
I fought inside and outside the country.

0:34:41.853 --> 0:34:45.253
I spilt blood, then fate flew me
to my Shahzade.

0:34:45.920 --> 0:34:51.020
From now on, my only wish, my only duty
is to protect my Shahzade and his family.

0:34:52.086 --> 0:34:56.720
That is why I contacted with the soldiers
I know within Karatoygar’s legion.

0:34:57.020 --> 0:34:59.020
That is the situation, Ertugrul Bey.

0:34:59.153 --> 0:35:01.320
This is what I want as well, Afsin Bey.

0:35:01.686 --> 0:35:05.253
To protect my tribe, my family, Halime...

0:35:07.320 --> 0:35:09.086
...and Halime’s family.

0:35:11.086 --> 0:35:13.653
As our wish and desires are the same...

0:35:14.620 --> 0:35:18.386
...we should stand as strong as mountains
against this dog called Karatoygar.

0:35:19.753 --> 0:35:22.086
You are a valiant man, Ertugrul Bey...

0:35:22.353 --> 0:35:25.886
...to fight side by side with you
is a pride, an honor for me.

0:35:28.086 --> 0:35:31.986
Then tell me, Afsin Bey.
Those soldiers you are in contact with.

0:35:33.320 --> 0:35:34.986
How effective are they?

0:35:35.786 --> 0:35:37.920
Let me tell you like this, Ertugrul Bey...

0:35:38.020 --> 0:35:41.220
...they are so effective that
when Karatoygar calls for help...

0:35:41.320 --> 0:35:44.153
...he will not find
a single soldier behind him.

0:35:44.253 --> 0:35:47.386
Then our job is to make him call for help.

0:35:54.320 --> 0:35:58.053
This means that in the life and death
situation at Kartal Tepesi...

0:35:58.186 --> 0:36:01.186
...we shall be the sword and
you shall be the shield, Afsin Bey.

0:36:01.320 --> 0:36:04.986
We will attack and you will keep
the Seljuk soldiers with Karatoygar...

0:36:05.120 --> 0:36:06.986
...on the right side.

0:36:07.186 --> 0:36:09.720
Of course, Ertugrul Bey. We shall be.

0:36:10.120 --> 0:36:14.686
Today, we shall be on the side of
the oppressed against the tyrants.

0:36:15.386 --> 0:36:18.120
The Owner of the oppressed is our Witness.

0:36:18.620 --> 0:36:20.986
May God be on our side and help us.

0:36:44.120 --> 0:36:45.653
Sari Bolu.

0:36:46.920 --> 0:36:48.853
Sari Bolu!

0:36:49.786 --> 0:36:51.353
You will pay for this.

0:36:52.286 --> 0:36:54.086
You lowlife scum!

0:36:54.386 --> 0:36:56.753
May you burn in hell, Karatoygar.

0:36:58.920 --> 0:37:04.886
You will all die along with the Shahzades.
I shall exterminate your progeny!

0:37:34.153 --> 0:37:36.186
Those days are over, Mother Hayme.

0:37:36.720 --> 0:37:40.120
It is time to think about
how we will pass the cliff in front of us.

0:37:40.220 --> 0:37:42.986
Alpargu! Know your place!

0:37:45.320 --> 0:37:48.920
Of course we have things to talk about,
for the future of our tribe.

0:37:49.086 --> 0:37:52.853
But this place is also
the private quarters of our Suleyman Shah.

0:37:53.186 --> 0:37:55.953
It is not suitable to bother Mother Hayme.

0:37:57.386 --> 0:37:59.186
She is in enough pain as it is.

0:38:00.720 --> 0:38:02.086
We were inconsiderate.

0:38:05.886 --> 0:38:07.653
Let us carry on in my tent.

0:38:11.153 --> 0:38:13.353
Carry the Bey symbols to my tent.

0:39:19.420 --> 0:39:21.786
We are all sorry for our losses, brother.

0:39:26.020 --> 0:39:30.286
The ambush on the caravan, the Alps
getting killed were not your fault.

0:39:30.886 --> 0:39:32.753
Did you know beforehand?

0:39:36.420 --> 0:39:40.086
Did you know that Numan was
a Shahzade beforehand?

0:39:41.153 --> 0:39:42.953
No, I just learned it.

0:39:45.053 --> 0:39:48.186
But it is obvious that
they had a good reason to hide it.

0:39:48.620 --> 0:39:50.986
He played you just like he played us...

0:39:51.120 --> 0:39:53.120
...but you still defend them!

0:40:02.286 --> 0:40:04.420
Let me go, you goat herders!

0:40:04.820 --> 0:40:06.386
Who do you think you are?

0:40:06.686 --> 0:40:07.820
Let me go!

0:40:21.220 --> 0:40:26.420
Banditry is not eternal, Karatoygar.
Your tyrant rule is over.

0:40:28.086 --> 0:40:30.153
You talk about banditry.

0:40:31.153 --> 0:40:35.886
The Turkmen tribe who ambushed
and captured a Seljuk commander.

0:40:38.286 --> 0:40:45.253
When Sultan Aladdin hears about this,
who do you think he will see as bandits?

0:40:46.153 --> 0:40:48.753
Do not waste your breath, Karatoygar.

0:40:49.220 --> 0:40:53.720
We will set a court and your verdict
will be given according to our customs.

0:40:54.853 --> 0:40:58.253
When custom speaks, Beys stop talking,
as well as the sultan.

0:41:08.886 --> 0:41:10.886
-Father?
-Are you fine, Bey?

0:41:11.153 --> 0:41:13.153
Would you like to rest a bit?

0:41:13.286 --> 0:41:15.186
I am fine, Wild Demir. I am fine.

0:41:15.886 --> 0:41:17.920
Are we returning to the tribe, father?

0:41:18.120 --> 0:41:23.820
No. First we will take back the goods
this lowlife looted from our caravan.

0:41:26.720 --> 0:41:30.353
Afsin Bey,
you know that I would die for you...

0:41:31.053 --> 0:41:34.053
...but what if this court ruling goes bad?

0:41:34.353 --> 0:41:38.086
Do not worry, Sari. Trust me.

0:42:03.120 --> 0:42:06.220
It is obvious that Kurdoglu
was waiting for a chance like this.

0:42:06.353 --> 0:42:09.386
How else could he act so quickly
to take over the post?

0:42:10.686 --> 0:42:14.820
Shameless man.
He even took the Bey symbols with him.

0:42:16.353 --> 0:42:18.820
And we are sitting here
with our hands tied.

0:42:19.420 --> 0:42:21.786
Enough, Aykiz. Enough.

0:42:22.620 --> 0:42:26.053
You make a fuss without
knowing how the state is run.

0:42:26.986 --> 0:42:30.120
-Do we have permission, Mother Hayme?
-Come, my girl. Come.

0:42:30.420 --> 0:42:31.786
What happened?

0:42:33.353 --> 0:42:38.186
You all wait with the pain inside you,
you do not think about your hunger.

0:42:38.686 --> 0:42:41.020
I wanted to bring you something to eat.

0:42:41.286 --> 0:42:45.753
Thank you, my girl. Put the pan on
the table and you sit down with us.

0:42:58.820 --> 0:43:01.153
We all wait with anxiety.

0:43:02.386 --> 0:43:07.653
While Suleyman Shah is leading them,
they will all come back safe and sound.

0:43:09.420 --> 0:43:12.953
But my sister is worrying a lot
about my brother in law Gundogdu.

0:43:15.053 --> 0:43:17.286
You all wait for your fathers...

0:43:21.286 --> 0:43:23.886
...and I pray for Ertugrul Bey.

0:43:37.953 --> 0:43:39.386
You are correct.

0:43:43.086 --> 0:43:45.853
I know the sorrow your sister
is going through.

0:43:46.153 --> 0:43:48.253
But let her be rest assured...

0:43:48.953 --> 0:43:51.053
...we shall leave the tribe soon.

0:44:04.720 --> 0:44:07.786
If God permits, they will all
return safe and sound.

0:44:07.920 --> 0:44:09.886
We can only pray for them.

0:44:24.286 --> 0:44:27.220
You bloodless dogs. Lowlifes!

0:44:27.753 --> 0:44:31.020
I will kill you all! Kill you all.

0:44:43.720 --> 0:44:48.753
You will pay for all of these!
I will destroy you all!

0:44:49.920 --> 0:44:56.086
Not only your tribe, there will be not
a single person left who remembers Kayis.

0:44:57.620 --> 0:44:59.853
I will kill you all!

0:45:03.120 --> 0:45:09.920
You shall leave immediately.
You will catch that dog called Gundogdu...

0:45:10.086 --> 0:45:13.220
...before he reaches his tribe...

0:45:13.386 --> 0:45:16.786
...and you'll bring him to Kartal Tepesi.

0:45:17.986 --> 0:45:21.886
-Kartal Tepesi?
-Kartal Tepesi, yes.

0:45:22.886 --> 0:45:28.120
Those Kayi goat herders are
setting us a trap there.

0:45:28.653 --> 0:45:33.986
Did you hear, Sari?
They think they can finish Karatoygar off.

0:45:35.253 --> 0:45:39.353
Bey, if you like we can go beforehand
take precautions.

0:45:39.686 --> 0:45:41.353
Yes, Sari Bolu...

0:45:42.253 --> 0:45:48.120
...place your most trusted
soldiers to the rocks of Kartal Tepesi.

0:45:49.353 --> 0:45:52.120
When I give the signal...

0:45:52.286 --> 0:45:57.053
...I want to turn that place
into hell for Kayis.

0:45:57.986 --> 0:45:59.186
As you wish!

0:46:10.086 --> 0:46:11.753
Sari Bolu.

0:46:19.953 --> 0:46:23.886
We checked the warehouse where
the goods are, they are all there, Bey.

0:46:29.286 --> 0:46:30.753
Are you fine, father?

0:46:31.986 --> 0:46:33.386
Yes, I am.

0:46:36.353 --> 0:46:38.953
Bey, you are tired...

0:46:39.386 --> 0:46:42.920
...I arranged a room for you to stay here
and rest for the night.

0:46:43.053 --> 0:46:44.653
We can go there if you wish.

0:46:44.786 --> 0:46:46.120
Thank you, commander.

0:46:49.386 --> 0:46:50.786
Ertugrul...

0:46:50.886 --> 0:46:53.953
...you stay here. I will go with Gundogdu.

0:47:16.953 --> 0:47:18.220
Ertugrul Bey...

0:47:21.120 --> 0:47:24.053
...there are some issues
we need to talk about.

0:47:33.920 --> 0:47:36.720
As if the problems they created for us
are not enough...

0:47:36.886 --> 0:47:41.020
...she goes and takes refuge with
Mother Hayme. Wolf in a sheep’s hide.

0:47:41.853 --> 0:47:45.953
But if my name is Selcan, I shall make you
pay for all you have done, Halime.

0:47:47.153 --> 0:47:48.253
Sister.

0:47:48.953 --> 0:47:51.720
Gokce, where were you?
Which corner did you hide in?

0:47:51.820 --> 0:47:52.886
Sister.

0:47:53.020 --> 0:47:56.386
The foreign girl goes and takes refuge
with Mother Hayme but my sister is...

0:47:56.720 --> 0:47:59.853
...all alone in a corner...
-Sister! You are mistaken!

0:48:00.286 --> 0:48:02.053
I am not hiding anywhere.

0:48:04.186 --> 0:48:07.086
I am coming from the marquee,
I was with them.

0:48:08.420 --> 0:48:10.186
Look at my sister.

0:48:15.753 --> 0:48:18.686
I approached them with
an excuse of bringing food.

0:48:18.920 --> 0:48:22.020
I said what I had to say and
I heard what I wanted to hear.

0:48:22.186 --> 0:48:23.753
What did you hear?

0:48:24.120 --> 0:48:27.986
Kurdoglu took the Bey symbols
and carried them to his tent.

0:48:28.353 --> 0:48:31.753
It is obvious that they lost hope of
Suleyman Shah’s return.

0:48:32.420 --> 0:48:35.786
-Did he take the Bey symbols to his tent?
-Yes.

0:48:41.853 --> 0:48:43.153
Kurdoglu.

0:48:45.153 --> 0:48:46.920
What is your intention?

0:48:48.120 --> 0:48:49.353
You wait here.

0:48:49.786 --> 0:48:50.953
Sister!

0:49:10.220 --> 0:49:11.653
Stop, Gundogdu.

0:49:14.220 --> 0:49:16.686
Today, I saw how you looked at Ertugrul.

0:49:17.386 --> 0:49:18.986
You are his brother.

0:49:19.953 --> 0:49:23.020
A brother should not look
at his brother with hatred.

0:49:24.353 --> 0:49:27.020
Moreover, he risked his life to save you.

0:49:28.720 --> 0:49:31.186
Father, what are you saying?

0:49:32.320 --> 0:49:34.420
He risked his life, is that so?

0:49:37.886 --> 0:49:43.786
I do not know whether he risked his life
for us or for his valuable guests...

0:49:43.986 --> 0:49:48.986
...but I know one thing, if we were
put in this bind, Ertugrul is the reason.

0:49:49.886 --> 0:49:53.853
You have hate in your eyes
after the ambush on the caravan.

0:49:55.820 --> 0:49:58.120
You look for a scapegoat to blame.

0:50:28.753 --> 0:50:30.786
Are you comfortable, Kurdoglu?

0:50:31.086 --> 0:50:35.786
Are you satisfied with sitting on Suleyman
Shah’s throne instead of saving Gundogdu?

0:50:37.886 --> 0:50:42.220
I do not reply as I know
you worry about your husband’s life...

0:50:42.753 --> 0:50:44.820
...but know your place, Selcan Hatun.

0:50:44.953 --> 0:50:48.086
I know my place,
that is why I am questioning you!

0:50:51.853 --> 0:50:54.653
Why don’t you do anything
to save Gundogdu?

0:50:54.886 --> 0:50:58.286
Do you see what is going on in this tribe?
Do you hear them?

0:50:58.620 --> 0:51:03.153
We faced many problems, if I didn’t act
fast the tribe was going to be divided.

0:51:03.320 --> 0:51:08.653
Who was to blame for those many problems?
Wasn’t it you who stirred up the trouble?

0:51:08.886 --> 0:51:13.153
I told you the things Suleyman Shah was
keeping secret, I committed an offence...

0:51:13.286 --> 0:51:16.953
...but what did you do? Nothing!
-What did you expect me to do?

0:51:17.153 --> 0:51:21.120
Do you see me as a traitor? Did you think
that I would share the secret plans...

0:51:21.253 --> 0:51:23.153
...of my tribe with the enemy?

0:51:25.753 --> 0:51:27.286
What will happen to them?

0:51:28.153 --> 0:51:31.286
If that dog called Karatoygar
kills my husband...

0:51:39.720 --> 0:51:42.053
We will pray for them to be spared.

0:51:45.786 --> 0:51:47.320
This is all we can do.

0:52:07.320 --> 0:52:12.253
We need to get out of the Seljuk territory
before all hell breaks loose again.

0:52:12.720 --> 0:52:17.820
Not for myself, for my son who sleeps
unbeknown to all that is happening.

0:52:19.920 --> 0:52:23.253
I understand you, my Shahzade. I guess
this is the best course of action...

0:52:23.386 --> 0:52:24.886
...for the good of everyone.

0:52:25.020 --> 0:52:28.020
But you may need to give us
horses and weapons for us to go.

0:52:29.420 --> 0:52:31.320
I have another plan in my mind.

0:52:32.253 --> 0:52:36.286
After the funerals, I shall request
permission from my father to go to Aleppo.

0:52:36.620 --> 0:52:39.220
I can take you there
safe and sound with my Alps.

0:52:39.653 --> 0:52:43.753
-After that...
-Thank you, Ertugrul Bey. Thank you.

0:52:46.986 --> 0:52:50.020
I shall always be thankful to you
and your family.

0:52:50.386 --> 0:52:55.420
Tomorrow we shall talk with Suleyman Shah
and set on the road as soon as possible.

0:54:19.853 --> 0:54:21.120
Ertugrul?

0:54:22.153 --> 0:54:23.753
You are not asleep.

0:54:25.853 --> 0:54:27.620
You are not asleep either.

0:54:37.386 --> 0:54:39.853
We managed to win this time as well...

0:54:40.286 --> 0:54:43.753
...but there is something eating
my heart from inside, Wild  Demir.

0:54:51.953 --> 0:54:54.986
How did Karatoygar learn that
we were at Kartal Tepesi?

0:54:58.086 --> 0:55:02.386
The thing that is eating your heart inside
is eating my heart as well.

0:55:04.720 --> 0:55:05.853
Look...

0:55:07.020 --> 0:55:09.053
...I will say something to you but...

0:55:10.386 --> 0:55:11.953
Tell me, Wild  Demir.

0:55:16.753 --> 0:55:20.686
That night when those dogs
staged an ambush on Halime’s tent...

0:55:21.820 --> 0:55:25.286
...the person who drove me away
from the tent...

0:55:26.286 --> 0:55:27.820
...was Kurdoglu.

0:55:29.186 --> 0:55:32.420
I don’t want to blame anyone
without proof, even Kurdoglu but...

0:55:32.720 --> 0:55:36.086
...this is a problem of the tribe.
You should be informed.

0:55:47.086 --> 0:55:49.153
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS CASTLE

0:56:48.386 --> 0:56:51.653
-You have a message from Titus, sir.
-What did he write?

0:57:05.686 --> 0:57:08.786
Fools.
They could not do one thing properly.

0:57:20.653 --> 0:57:22.020
Check...

0:57:23.920 --> 0:57:25.186
...and mate.

0:57:27.386 --> 0:57:30.819
Do not forget, when the game ends...

0:57:31.386 --> 0:57:37.020
...the king and pawns
are put in the same box at the end.

0:57:40.253 --> 0:57:45.020
Only the ones who clear the table
know who is victorious.

0:57:47.620 --> 0:57:54.020
Be careful and don’t make me angry
before you go in the box.

0:57:55.853 --> 0:57:58.053
Send a message to Titus, immediately.

0:57:58.386 --> 0:58:01.620
He should not sacrifice
Karatoygar for anyone.

0:58:01.920 --> 0:58:06.153
Can Titus still prevent
Kayis from coming to Aleppo?

0:58:07.120 --> 0:58:11.920
I do not know where he can succeed or not.
Not being able to see the future...

0:58:12.220 --> 0:58:17.286
...is torturing my soul.
Tell them to get prepared, Marcus.

0:58:18.420 --> 0:58:20.853
You are coming with me to Aleppo.

0:58:21.053 --> 0:58:23.886
We have some business to attend
with Nasir.

0:58:25.053 --> 0:58:28.020
Do you have any other
orders for Titus, sir?

0:58:29.220 --> 0:58:33.020
He should make the wrath of Karatoygar
fall upon the Kayis.

0:58:33.420 --> 0:58:38.886
He can either do this himself
or use Kurdoglu.

0:58:42.686 --> 0:58:46.953
This shall be his decision,
as he will be responsible for the outcome.

0:58:56.153 --> 0:59:00.086
Where is Suleyman Shah?
They say that our caravan was ambushed.

0:59:00.420 --> 0:59:02.153
Where are the bodies, Bey?

0:59:02.286 --> 0:59:07.220
He is right. Where is Bey, where are
the bodies? What is happening, Kurdoglu?

0:59:08.153 --> 0:59:12.286
Beys of Kayi.
Today is not the day for complaints.

0:59:13.620 --> 0:59:18.286
We still have no news from our tribe’s
pillar Suleyman Shah and our Alps.

0:59:19.620 --> 0:59:23.353
God forbid, we need to be prepared
for all possibilities.

0:59:25.153 --> 0:59:28.386
The unity and future of
our tribe is under threat.

0:59:30.620 --> 0:59:33.853
And this Aleppo issue
in the middle of all these troubles.

0:59:35.253 --> 0:59:38.786
The decision our Bey took in good times...

0:59:39.086 --> 0:59:42.186
...should be reconsidered under
these harsh conditions.

0:59:42.386 --> 0:59:45.820
What else can we do, Kurdoglu?
What is on your mind?

0:59:46.186 --> 0:59:50.420
Before I state the thing on my mind,
I would like to remind you that...

0:59:51.086 --> 0:59:55.186
...Suleyman Shah Bey appointed me as
the head of the tribe before leaving.

0:59:55.653 --> 1:00:00.420
-My words are our Bey’s words.
-Of course.

1:00:04.853 --> 1:00:09.786
My heart is not in peace with setting foot
on the unknown path of Aleppo.

1:00:11.186 --> 1:00:13.186
To migrate, we need to find...

1:00:26.653 --> 1:00:30.420
-Suleyman Shah has returned!
-Suleyman Shah is back!

1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:01.320
Stop!

1:02:01.886 --> 1:02:03.653
Stop! Stop!

1:02:05.386 --> 1:02:08.186
Do not do anything
that is indecorum to Kayis.

1:02:09.053 --> 1:02:11.720
We shall talk about
the trial in the headquarters.

1:02:11.986 --> 1:02:14.320
The verdict shall be from our customs.

1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:23.753
Tie him up to the log.

1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:26.353
Let me go!

1:02:28.620 --> 1:02:30.886
I will kill you all!

1:02:32.053 --> 1:02:34.786
-Kill him!
-Don’t make him live!

1:02:35.053 --> 1:02:37.786
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

1:03:15.253 --> 1:03:19.220
Thank God, you are back safe and sound.
God has accepted my prayers.

1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:42.053
Suleyman. Suleyman.

1:03:42.953 --> 1:03:44.086
Suleyman.

1:03:45.353 --> 1:03:46.686
Dear God.

0:02:03.665 --> 0:02:05.665


1:03:45.350 --> 1:03:46.416
Dear God.

1:03:57.250 --> 1:04:00.950
You will pay for this.
Your tribe will be exterminated!

1:04:02.483 --> 1:04:04.783
You won’t have any daylight to see.

1:04:04.916 --> 1:04:07.250
Look at that lowlife dog, still barking!

1:04:07.350 --> 1:04:09.916
Stop! What are you doing?
Didn’t you hear Bey’s orders?

1:04:10.016 --> 1:04:12.483
Would a Kayi member violate
his Bey’s order?

1:04:19.650 --> 1:04:25.050
Suleyman, you are not well,
let me call Akcakoca to come and see you.

1:04:26.483 --> 1:04:29.350
Do not worry, Hayme. I am only tired.

1:04:32.316 --> 1:04:33.883
Where are the Bey symbols?

1:04:37.616 --> 1:04:39.950
Kurdoglu’s doings. Come on.

1:04:42.383 --> 1:04:43.516
Lay back.

1:04:45.650 --> 1:04:46.783
Never mind.

1:04:49.650 --> 1:04:53.450
Do not frown, Hayme.
Let us catch our breath first...

1:04:54.716 --> 1:04:57.250
...we will talk about what happened later.

1:05:09.683 --> 1:05:11.283
He swung his sword and...

1:05:11.783 --> 1:05:13.516
...cut the enemy’s throat.

1:05:14.050 --> 1:05:17.016
I wish I could have been there
and saw it with my own eyes.

1:05:17.616 --> 1:05:20.850
You know, when I grow up I will be like
my brother Ertugrul...

1:05:20.983 --> 1:05:23.683
...as strong and as brave as him.

1:05:29.783 --> 1:05:30.983
See?

1:05:32.916 --> 1:05:35.816
If you keep this up,
you will surpass all the Alps, Dundar.

1:05:35.950 --> 1:05:39.450
Brother? Yigit was telling me
how you fought with the enemy.

1:05:39.583 --> 1:05:42.750
He was very brave as well,
did he tell you those as well?

1:05:43.783 --> 1:05:45.883
I will go and check on my father.

1:05:47.450 --> 1:05:50.383
Tell me now.
Did you do the job I gave you?

1:05:51.783 --> 1:05:54.616
After you left,
something happened to the tribe.

1:05:54.950 --> 1:05:56.716
They stoned Halime Abla’s tent.

1:05:56.816 --> 1:05:58.850
-They stoned the tent?
-Yes.

1:05:58.983 --> 1:06:00.883
-Halime Abla was inside.
-Inside?

1:06:00.983 --> 1:06:03.650
Thank God my mother came
and scored them off.

1:06:03.816 --> 1:06:06.350
Then she took Halime Abla to our tent.

1:06:23.416 --> 1:06:27.350
I know you are troubled.
I know you went through a lot.

1:06:27.850 --> 1:06:32.683
But these are all temporary,
you know how to pass these difficulties.

1:06:34.483 --> 1:06:38.450
I did not only make a problem for myself,
I made a problem for others as well.

1:06:39.516 --> 1:06:41.016
Be more gentle, Hatun.

1:06:44.316 --> 1:06:48.383
I don’t know whether I should be angry
for the death of Alps who were with me...

1:06:48.550 --> 1:06:51.350
...or that I was taken
prisoner by Karatoygar.

1:06:51.616 --> 1:06:58.350
Should I be ashamed of our Bey,
my own father, to surrender to save me...

1:06:59.350 --> 1:07:02.316
...or Ertugrul to become
the hero of the day.

1:07:04.016 --> 1:07:06.750
They sowed the seeds,
Karatoygar mowed you.

1:07:06.916 --> 1:07:10.416
Are you blaming yourself
for being grinded in the millstone?

1:07:10.550 --> 1:07:13.050
The real culprits are enjoying themselves.

1:07:21.050 --> 1:07:22.416
Brother.

1:07:26.550 --> 1:07:29.950
Welcome, Ertugrul Bey.
I was coming to see you.

1:07:30.816 --> 1:07:34.350
Brother, mother should have prepared
some food, let me go and check.

1:07:41.283 --> 1:07:44.983
My heart was right.
You kept your promise once again.

1:07:46.950 --> 1:07:50.350
You brought my father and brother
back to me safe and sound.

1:07:50.616 --> 1:07:52.750
May God bless you, Ertugrul Bey.

1:07:53.450 --> 1:07:55.816
Thank God, we had the chance to return.

1:07:57.950 --> 1:08:01.650
I heard about what some people did
when we were gone, Halime Sultan.

1:08:02.850 --> 1:08:06.616
I heard that some presumptuous people
did some unforgivable things.

1:08:07.350 --> 1:08:10.416
They betrayed their Bey and
customs to stone a tent.

1:08:11.383 --> 1:08:13.250
You were not here but...

1:08:13.416 --> 1:08:16.950
...Bey’s wife, most gracious Mother Hayme
stood before them like a mountain.

1:08:17.250 --> 1:08:20.716
-She took me under her wings.
-They will pay for what they did.

1:08:22.250 --> 1:08:25.683
You have returned safe and sound,
that is enough for me.

1:08:25.916 --> 1:08:29.750
As I am thankful to God, I have
no place for anger in my heart or tongue.

1:08:30.283 --> 1:08:34.550
Do not dwell on those tactless people,
Ertugrul. They were in pain.

1:08:35.316 --> 1:08:37.883
They lost their loved ones because of us.

1:08:38.350 --> 1:08:43.383
You have such a pure heart, even the evil
things done against you cannot defile it.

1:08:45.383 --> 1:08:49.383
In the lifetime allocated to us,
there are things which are good or evil.

1:08:49.616 --> 1:08:53.050
We thank God, when He gives a sorrow,
He gives a remedy as well.

1:08:54.416 --> 1:08:58.683
My father told me that you will be with us
until we leave the Seljuk territory.

1:09:00.416 --> 1:09:01.550
If God permits.

1:09:03.616 --> 1:09:05.550
I will be beside the tree.

1:09:06.316 --> 1:09:10.416
With your permission, I would like to
introduce you to a very nice girl.

1:09:17.783 --> 1:09:19.050
Gundogdu Bey...

1:09:20.716 --> 1:09:23.950
...if there is someone who should be
ashamed, that person is not you.

1:09:24.283 --> 1:09:27.516
Ertugrul should be ashamed
as he led this curse upon our tribe.

1:09:29.883 --> 1:09:32.516
Look at the situation I am in, Hatun.

1:09:35.650 --> 1:09:39.016
Look at the place I fell down to
in the eyes of the tribe.

1:09:40.450 --> 1:09:42.383
My honor is crushed.

1:09:44.350 --> 1:09:47.350
Do not worry, people knows the truth.

1:09:48.483 --> 1:09:51.750
Wind cannot rock a stone,
only takes the dust on it.

1:09:51.916 --> 1:09:55.350
Giving up does not suit you.
Now come to the table.

1:09:55.950 --> 1:09:58.683
Your father expects all the family
to be there.

1:10:24.416 --> 1:10:28.383
What will happen now, Bey?
What if Karatoygar talks?

1:10:30.583 --> 1:10:34.483
We will do whatever is needed.
The arrow has left the bow.

1:10:35.283 --> 1:10:37.450
It will hit whoever is on its path.

1:10:37.583 --> 1:10:40.350
Bey, even if we deal with Karatoygar...

1:10:40.483 --> 1:10:43.816
...we fueled the fire in the tribe while
Suleyman Shah was gone.

1:10:43.950 --> 1:10:46.050
Won’t he ask about the culprits?

1:10:46.450 --> 1:10:50.383
If he starts to investigate the matter,
my head will be on the line first.

1:10:50.550 --> 1:10:54.050
Baybora, we are in a storm
at the moment...

1:10:55.450 --> 1:11:00.316
...if you shiver like a dried leaf, you
would be blown away. Try to stand strong.

1:11:00.516 --> 1:11:02.016
What can I do, Bey?

1:11:02.916 --> 1:11:04.950
Go and hide for a while.

1:11:05.383 --> 1:11:07.683
I will call you back when
the storm subsides.

1:11:07.850 --> 1:11:10.550
-Alright, Bey.
-What will we do, Bey?

1:11:11.250 --> 1:11:17.450
What can we do? We'll deliver the symbols
we secured while he was away...

1:11:18.716 --> 1:11:21.016
...back to Suleyman Shah.

1:11:47.583 --> 1:11:50.616
-Where is your brother?
-He is talking with Halime Abla.

1:12:07.883 --> 1:12:09.616
I am sorry that I am late.

1:12:18.350 --> 1:12:20.683
Gokce, come on my girl, you sit as well.

1:12:28.250 --> 1:12:29.550
In the name of God.

1:12:50.350 --> 1:12:52.716
We delayed it due to these
recent events but...

1:12:52.850 --> 1:12:55.850
...I need to take the signed letter
back to Aleppo, father.

1:13:05.316 --> 1:13:08.883
The guests would like to go as well.
I do not know their destination...

1:13:09.250 --> 1:13:12.550
...but we discussed that
we can at least go to Aleppo together.

1:13:12.716 --> 1:13:14.516
If you give permission.

1:13:14.750 --> 1:13:18.683
After the feast meeting and the funerals,
we shall think about it.

1:13:44.516 --> 1:13:45.583
Baybora.

1:13:53.883 --> 1:13:55.516
There it is, Alpargu...

1:13:56.983 --> 1:14:00.350
...we brought back the Bey symbols to
where they belong.

1:14:10.516 --> 1:14:14.416
-What is happening, Rahman?
-Kurdoglu. Brought back the Bey symbols.

1:14:14.583 --> 1:14:16.916
He asks for permission to come in.

1:14:23.416 --> 1:14:25.316
Tell him to wait.

1:15:52.816 --> 1:15:57.916
Now, tell me.
Who told you the tent Hamza was hiding in?

1:16:24.416 --> 1:16:26.616
Come on. I am listening. Tell me.

1:16:30.250 --> 1:16:31.883
Who was behind this malice?

1:16:32.450 --> 1:16:35.350
I cannot talk, Bey.
If I do, they would kill me.

1:16:35.516 --> 1:16:37.383
So they would kill you.

1:16:39.050 --> 1:16:42.316
Who told you that
we would spare you if you don’t?

1:16:46.350 --> 1:16:47.850
Go on, talk, you dog!

1:16:48.016 --> 1:16:51.716
The stones you threw to Halime Baci’s
tent, were they as big as these?

1:17:03.250 --> 1:17:04.516
Talk...

1:17:05.550 --> 1:17:07.450
...so that you have a chance.

1:17:09.283 --> 1:17:14.050
Who provoked you to attack? Who? Tell me!

1:17:15.283 --> 1:17:16.350
Dogan...

1:17:17.850 --> 1:17:21.683
...these valiant people
do not deserve small stones like pebbles.

1:17:22.950 --> 1:17:26.050
Big rocks like this one are more suitable.

1:17:29.516 --> 1:17:30.683
It was Baybora.

1:17:31.683 --> 1:17:33.016
It was Baybora’s doing.

1:17:33.983 --> 1:17:35.550
Mother of a son...

1:18:04.816 --> 1:18:08.816
As if my brother’s madness,
my father’s stubbornness...

1:18:09.750 --> 1:18:12.716
...and the cruelty of the enemy
is not enough...

1:18:13.750 --> 1:18:15.750
...we have a traitor within us.

1:18:18.016 --> 1:18:20.916
A traitor who sells
his own people to the enemy.

1:18:22.616 --> 1:18:24.250
Who is this traitor?

1:18:24.383 --> 1:18:25.716
If I knew...

1:18:25.983 --> 1:18:28.850
If I knew,
I would punish him with my own hands.

1:18:30.050 --> 1:18:32.250
But he must be very close.

1:18:33.716 --> 1:18:37.316
So there is a traitor nearby teaming up
with the enemy but you still...

1:18:37.483 --> 1:18:41.050
...hide in your tent and keep quiet,
is that so?

1:18:46.483 --> 1:18:50.450
Don’t you understand? You are
the only hope for this tribe, Gundogdu.

1:18:50.650 --> 1:18:54.583
Don’t leave the field empty for others
to roam, don’t let unity of the tribe...

1:18:54.716 --> 1:18:58.250
...fall apart for those faceless people
who we don’t know anything about.

1:18:58.616 --> 1:19:01.450
You know those people
who you call faceless...

1:19:02.716 --> 1:19:03.850
Who?

1:19:06.516 --> 1:19:08.883
They are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.

1:19:10.550 --> 1:19:15.583
The man called Numan is a Shahzade and
that girl you look down on, is a sultan.

1:19:20.483 --> 1:19:23.316
Now I understand everything
that has happened.

1:19:23.483 --> 1:19:27.050
The trouble Ertugrul brought
to our tribe overwhelmed him as well.

1:19:27.883 --> 1:19:31.450
Will you sit here and watch like
an outsider or will you get up...

1:19:31.616 --> 1:19:34.850
...show what you are made of?
-Don’t you understand, Hatun?

1:19:35.783 --> 1:19:39.050
He is the one who is protecting
Shahzade and his family...

1:19:39.383 --> 1:19:42.483
...he is the one who saved me,
he is the one who saved my father...

1:19:42.616 --> 1:19:44.883
...he is the one who captured Karatoygar.

1:19:45.383 --> 1:19:47.350
-But...
-There is no but to it!

1:19:47.950 --> 1:19:49.916
Enough. I am tired.

1:20:52.883 --> 1:20:57.050
After we leave the Seljuk territory
safely with the help of Ertugrul Bey...

1:20:57.416 --> 1:21:00.683
...the rest is my duty, my Shahzade.
You can be rest assured.

1:21:00.883 --> 1:21:04.450
You have helped us greatly
in our time of need, Afsin Bey.

1:21:04.750 --> 1:21:07.583
-Thank you.
-Not at all, my Shahzade. It is our duty.

1:21:07.716 --> 1:21:08.850
Father...

1:21:12.916 --> 1:21:14.250
My son?

1:21:18.516 --> 1:21:21.916
I am fed up of running away.
We are always on the road.

1:21:22.383 --> 1:21:25.783
We are always running away.
I get scared while running away, father.

1:21:28.483 --> 1:21:32.350
This is the first time I had a friend.
For the first time I played games.

1:21:33.983 --> 1:21:36.850
I don’t want to leave, father.
Let us stay here.

1:21:39.483 --> 1:21:41.483
But we have to go, my son.

1:21:43.750 --> 1:21:46.483
For your sister, for your future...

1:21:46.850 --> 1:21:48.483
...we have to go.

1:23:22.350 --> 1:23:26.050
I saw this mare in the mountains
where I had gone to become an Alp.

1:23:26.550 --> 1:23:31.783
That is why she was different from the
other mares. More wild, more maverick.

1:23:38.350 --> 1:23:43.283
She was very hard to catch,
even harder to bring to the tribe.

1:23:44.916 --> 1:23:46.683
She was very stubborn.

1:23:48.316 --> 1:23:53.283
Then she drank the water of the tribe,
ate its bread. She was tamed.

1:23:55.750 --> 1:23:59.783
As she believed and trusted,
she understood her value in my eyes.

1:24:03.283 --> 1:24:07.350
She is yours now.
If you give permission...

1:24:07.983 --> 1:24:09.583
...I named her Sultan.

1:24:10.983 --> 1:24:12.650
God willing...

1:24:12.916 --> 1:24:15.416
...you shall never be separated from her.

1:25:04.816 --> 1:25:07.250
We have a long journey ahead of us.

1:25:09.350 --> 1:25:12.283
Even if the end is imminent,
the road is ours.

1:25:15.450 --> 1:25:16.883
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

1:25:18.650 --> 1:25:21.316
I shall look after Sultan
as if she is my eyes.

1:25:22.316 --> 1:25:24.816
She will be by my side as long as I live.

1:25:32.250 --> 1:25:33.750
With my apologies, Bey.

1:25:34.783 --> 1:25:37.516
We found out the person
who provoked the public.

1:25:40.916 --> 1:25:43.850
-Who was it?
-Baybora.

1:26:16.550 --> 1:26:20.450
I hope you did not get bored of waiting,
Kurdoglu. I know...

1:26:20.883 --> 1:26:22.683
...you don’t like to wait.

1:26:23.483 --> 1:26:24.983
Not at all, Bey.

1:26:25.316 --> 1:26:28.383
We would wait for you
until our last day if needed.

1:26:28.550 --> 1:26:31.816
May it be easy on you, Bey.
God spared you for us.

1:26:32.883 --> 1:26:34.983
What happened is in the past.

1:26:35.450 --> 1:26:38.983
You tell me now, what happened
in the tribe while I was away?

1:26:39.383 --> 1:26:42.483
Some people saw Hamza, Bey.
They got suspicious.

1:26:42.816 --> 1:26:45.583
They created a bit of
a havoc in the tribe.

1:26:45.950 --> 1:26:50.883
Thank God, Mother Hayme came out and
put those tactless people in their place.

1:26:54.683 --> 1:26:59.550
Hayme may have put those tactless people
in their place, what did you do, Kurdoglu?

1:26:59.883 --> 1:27:04.250
First I gathered the Beys
in the marquee to calm them down.

1:27:04.783 --> 1:27:08.716
I did not want them to see
the marquee empty and to think that...

1:27:08.883 --> 1:27:12.550
...no one is leading them. Otherwise,
things might have gone out of control.

1:27:12.750 --> 1:27:16.350
We did what we had to do and
controlled the situation, thanks to you.

1:27:16.483 --> 1:27:17.950
Well...

1:27:18.650 --> 1:27:21.750
...what about taking
the Bey symbols out, Kurdoglu?

1:27:22.416 --> 1:27:23.816
Bey...

1:27:24.416 --> 1:27:27.950
...while Hayme Hatun was dealing with
her own troubles here...

1:27:28.283 --> 1:27:32.416
...I didn't think it would be wise to deal
with the tribe issues here as well.

1:27:33.750 --> 1:27:35.016
Thank you.

1:27:39.283 --> 1:27:42.316
But, there is a traitor in the tribe,
this is obvious.

1:27:42.716 --> 1:27:44.316
As I said, Bey...

1:27:44.750 --> 1:27:50.483
...some people saw Hamza. They must have
seen him while Akcakoca was going in...

1:27:50.650 --> 1:27:52.783
...and getting out of the tent.

1:27:53.716 --> 1:27:56.516
This is not one, not two, Kurdoglu.

1:27:57.816 --> 1:28:01.516
When they ambushed the tribe,
someone showed them the way.

1:28:01.683 --> 1:28:06.016
The same person informed Karatoygar about
the trap we set at the place of exchange.

1:28:06.316 --> 1:28:08.583
If Ertugrul did not change the plan...

1:28:08.816 --> 1:28:11.650
...we would have been killed
at those rocks.

1:28:11.983 --> 1:28:17.350
If there is such a traitor, Bey, I would
skin him alive in the middle of the tribe.

1:28:21.350 --> 1:28:23.650
Do you have any other orders for me, Bey?

1:28:25.016 --> 1:28:28.550
We will gather the Beys at
the headquarters and talk about the trial.

1:28:28.716 --> 1:28:32.983
My wish is to send Karatoygar
to the Sultan for him to convict.

1:28:35.950 --> 1:28:40.983
Support me in the headquarters. Help me.
We need to calm down the public.

1:28:41.450 --> 1:28:43.616
This is the wisest decision, Bey.

1:28:44.916 --> 1:28:46.450
Do not worry.

1:29:01.883 --> 1:29:03.383
Hayme...

1:29:03.850 --> 1:29:08.416
...my valiant wife.
We passed through a very difficult time.

1:29:08.916 --> 1:29:13.883
Do not over think these things. Kurdoglu
did what he had to do. Do not dwell on it.

1:29:17.283 --> 1:29:19.383
You know best, Bey.

1:29:46.283 --> 1:29:48.050
What are you doing in my tent?

1:29:48.383 --> 1:29:51.650
There is a ring of fire all around us,
what would people think?

1:29:51.950 --> 1:29:55.816
Do not speak negatively, Kurdoglu.
We are partners of crime now.

1:29:55.950 --> 1:29:59.650
We will either rise together
or we will sink together.

1:30:00.550 --> 1:30:04.283
Moreover, when you hear the thing
I came here to tell you...

1:30:04.450 --> 1:30:06.550
...you will be thanking me.

1:30:09.250 --> 1:30:13.816
Do you know who those migrating birds
that took refuge in our tribe really are?

1:30:24.716 --> 1:30:27.750
Yes, Kurdoglu Bey. I shall inform
Gundogdu Bey that you will visit him.

1:30:27.850 --> 1:30:28.850
He will be glad.

1:30:37.516 --> 1:30:41.783
What happened, Ertugrul? Why did you
fall on my tent like a lightning?

1:30:42.616 --> 1:30:44.483
Do you know where Baybora is?

1:30:44.750 --> 1:30:48.350
How should I know, Ertugrul?
But if you need him, I can send someone.

1:30:48.450 --> 1:30:51.050
Do not bother yourself. I will find him.

1:31:10.816 --> 1:31:11.916
Sister...

1:31:13.283 --> 1:31:14.716
-Sister.
-What?

1:31:15.283 --> 1:31:19.016
Ertugrul and Halime were together
under a tree all alone.

1:31:21.583 --> 1:31:24.883
It is obvious that Ertugrul Bey
is determined to go with them.

1:31:26.550 --> 1:31:28.516
I saw them with my own eyes.

1:31:28.983 --> 1:31:31.716
-He gave that girl a horse as a present.
-Enough!

1:31:32.983 --> 1:31:35.650
I have to take matters
in my own hands once again.

1:31:35.850 --> 1:31:37.883
You can sit and cry, Gokce.

1:31:48.950 --> 1:31:51.250
Ertugrul has connected the dots.

1:31:51.516 --> 1:31:52.750
Finish off Baybora.

1:31:53.616 --> 1:31:56.783
We have to break the chain before
it gets tangled around our throats.

1:32:09.583 --> 1:32:11.450
Do we have permission, father?

1:32:11.816 --> 1:32:13.383
Come in, my girl, come.

1:32:20.916 --> 1:32:24.316
How are you, father? Do you need anything?

1:32:24.716 --> 1:32:27.716
Thank you, my bride. How are you?

1:32:29.350 --> 1:32:30.650
How is Gundogdu?

1:32:31.650 --> 1:32:35.783
He is sad, father. I am afraid that
he may not recover from this.

1:32:36.716 --> 1:32:41.650
He is in great pain but the worst one
is the Alps who got killed.

1:32:44.650 --> 1:32:48.650
He came up with the idea of
going to Aleppo. He found a new home...

1:32:48.916 --> 1:32:52.750
...but he did not even have the chance
to be happy when he heard the news.

1:32:53.316 --> 1:32:57.683
When Ertugrul said that he will return
to Aleppo, he got even more depressed.

1:33:00.316 --> 1:33:04.316
If Gundogdu can go to Aleppo,
he might recover somewhat.

1:33:06.016 --> 1:33:10.616
I do not know what to do.
I just wait without a direction.

1:33:11.516 --> 1:33:16.383
Gundogdu on one side
and Gokce on the other.

1:33:19.016 --> 1:33:23.550
When she learned that Ertugrul and Halime
will go to Aleppo, she got depressed.

1:33:23.716 --> 1:33:25.883
You know how sensitive she is.

1:33:27.050 --> 1:33:31.250
She worries that a shadow might
cast over her happiness with Ertugrul.

1:33:56.383 --> 1:33:57.716
Look, son...

1:33:58.883 --> 1:34:03.250
...the thing you are beating is
a bar of iron, not Karatoygar’s head.

1:34:11.350 --> 1:34:14.683
It is as if you have a problem
but you do not talk about it.

1:34:14.983 --> 1:34:16.716
What use would talking do?

1:34:16.883 --> 1:34:18.750
What use would keeping quiet do?

1:34:21.316 --> 1:34:22.683
Look now...

1:34:22.983 --> 1:34:26.316
...there is one problem
which is beyond all other problems.

1:34:26.516 --> 1:34:30.983
It is beyond migrating or
fighting in a battle.

1:34:48.783 --> 1:34:49.850
Bey...

1:34:50.016 --> 1:34:53.416
...there is someone who wants to see you.
-Who?

1:34:58.950 --> 1:35:04.716
It is such a big problem that many Beys,
many valiant Alps cannot handle it.

1:35:09.383 --> 1:35:13.050
My problem is such a problem
that it cannot be said, Wild Demir.

1:35:13.983 --> 1:35:17.050
I do not know the words
that can describe this problem.

1:35:21.816 --> 1:35:24.616
The tongue is only
a messenger of the heart, son.

1:35:26.516 --> 1:35:29.016
The problem is not in the tongue
but in the heart.

1:35:29.383 --> 1:35:31.583
If your heart is in the right place...

1:35:31.750 --> 1:35:35.283
...your tongue and your words
would find the right path.

1:35:39.683 --> 1:35:42.416
But your problem is obvious, son.

1:35:43.316 --> 1:35:46.516
There is only one problem
that scares a brave...

1:35:47.750 --> 1:35:49.416
...and that is love.

1:35:53.016 --> 1:35:57.283
If you open your heart
to the one you love...

1:35:58.816 --> 1:36:01.416
...you would grow like an sycamore tree.

1:36:01.650 --> 1:36:03.483
If you do not...

1:36:04.916 --> 1:36:07.650
...a worm would start eating you alive
from inside.

1:36:07.916 --> 1:36:11.950
Even if you are a great sycamore tree,
you would fall down.

1:36:12.916 --> 1:36:14.516
How can I do it?

1:36:18.550 --> 1:36:23.616
She can never abandon her father or
brother and I cannot abandon my home.

1:36:25.550 --> 1:36:29.816
Tribe is a tribe with loved ones.
Home is a home with loved ones.

1:36:30.550 --> 1:36:32.883
You are Ertugrul with your love...

1:36:33.850 --> 1:36:38.550
...if you do not have love,
any place you call home...

1:36:39.416 --> 1:36:43.250
...any sword you swing to the infidels
would not be satisfy you.

1:36:43.583 --> 1:36:46.950
Come on,
break that chain on your tongue...

1:36:47.883 --> 1:36:52.816
...so that your heart can have some peace.
-The corpses of our Alps are coming.

1:38:03.883 --> 1:38:05.683
What is your benefit in this?

1:38:07.816 --> 1:38:12.516
We don’t want you to settle on our borders
and be trouble for us. That is all.

1:38:13.316 --> 1:38:16.316
According to Karatoygar,
you are an intelligent man.

1:38:16.450 --> 1:38:19.616
If he is right,
all three of us want the same thing.

1:38:21.750 --> 1:38:28.483
The thing that will save Kayis and you,
is Karatoygar to be the head commander.

1:38:29.550 --> 1:38:33.883
He is the only person that would make
you Bey and let your tribe migrate...

1:38:34.750 --> 1:38:38.850
...to anywhere you like. You are in a hole
of dirt up to your throat, Kurdoglu.

1:38:39.050 --> 1:38:42.916
The blood of the Alps, which you will be
burying soon is on your hands.

1:38:43.316 --> 1:38:46.816
You cannot clean your hands without
becoming the Bey of the tribe.

1:38:46.983 --> 1:38:50.616
It is not possible for me to make
Karatoygar escape from the tribe but...

1:38:50.783 --> 1:38:53.383
...if you are as strong as
you claim to be...

1:38:53.983 --> 1:38:55.616
...you can save him.

1:39:10.283 --> 1:39:12.716
Why did we need to meet secretly, Alpargu?

1:39:13.350 --> 1:39:14.750
Ertugrul...

1:39:15.383 --> 1:39:17.583
...found out that you provoked the public.

1:39:17.950 --> 1:39:20.550
-How?
-He probably made your dogs talk.

1:39:21.283 --> 1:39:24.250
You lowlife! I warned you all!

1:39:24.483 --> 1:39:27.750
I told you that we cannot get away
with it! You did not hear me!

1:39:27.950 --> 1:39:31.050
It was you and Kurdoglu that made
everything come to this point.

1:39:31.350 --> 1:39:32.816
What will I do now?

1:39:32.983 --> 1:39:35.916
Get on your horse and run away.
Don’t ever look back.

1:39:36.316 --> 1:39:38.450
Where will I go? Where?

1:39:38.716 --> 1:39:42.250
I have children.
How can I leave them behind and go?

1:39:42.516 --> 1:39:45.283
You shall return when
we set everything straight.

1:39:45.450 --> 1:39:48.983
This is not a dirt on the hand
that can be washed away in a few seconds.

1:39:49.316 --> 1:39:52.783
So many Alps died,
all the goods in the caravan are gone.

1:39:54.550 --> 1:39:58.250
-You think Suleyman Shah would let it go?
-Control yourself, Baybora!

1:39:59.950 --> 1:40:01.783
How can I go without them?

1:40:02.550 --> 1:40:05.583
How can my children live
in the tribe with this shame?

1:40:07.250 --> 1:40:08.550
You lowlife!

1:40:11.850 --> 1:40:13.383
Do not worry...

1:40:13.616 --> 1:40:16.416
...I will look after your family.

1:41:36.250 --> 1:41:37.683
For the men who died...

1:42:22.783 --> 1:42:26.516
Our brothers ask for your
blessing one last time.

1:42:27.316 --> 1:42:29.716
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

1:42:29.950 --> 1:42:31.850
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

1:42:31.950 --> 1:42:33.916
-Do you bless them?
-We bless them!

1:42:34.616 --> 1:42:36.983
If God permits,
they will forgive us as well.

1:42:37.916 --> 1:42:41.383
For our Great Prophet
Mohammed’s assistance...

1:42:42.616 --> 1:42:44.516
For the souls of our brothers...

1:42:44.950 --> 1:42:47.316
For the unity and blessing of our tribe...

1:42:47.483 --> 1:42:48.816
For God’s mercy...

1:42:48.950 --> 1:42:50.783
...recite Al Fatiha prayer.

0:02:05.690 --> 0:02:07.690


1:42:48.946 --> 1:42:50.813
...recite Al Fatiha prayer.

1:44:32.113 --> 1:44:33.246
My Beys...

1:44:34.380 --> 1:44:35.713
My braves...

1:44:36.680 --> 1:44:38.080
Wise men of my tribe...

1:44:38.446 --> 1:44:41.013
...I know what is in your hearts...

1:44:42.713 --> 1:44:45.746
...we have the right for revenge
from this lowlife.

1:44:46.313 --> 1:44:52.380
He should not get away with the blood he
spilt and the curses he got for cruelty.

1:44:53.380 --> 1:44:54.846
But...

1:44:55.180 --> 1:44:58.180
...executing this lowlife is not for us.

1:45:10.846 --> 1:45:14.980
His sentence should be given
by Sultan Aladdin.

1:45:19.946 --> 1:45:21.413
Suleyman Shah...

1:45:22.246 --> 1:45:24.680
...how many mothers are mourning now.

1:45:24.846 --> 1:45:28.080
They think about their loved ones
who died at the hands of Karatoygar.

1:45:28.213 --> 1:45:31.013
Your words are burning through our hearts.

1:45:31.213 --> 1:45:35.813
You are so unaware! When did you see
our Bey make our tribe bow down in shame?

1:45:36.313 --> 1:45:39.380
Our Bey knows what is best for all of us.

1:45:41.213 --> 1:45:42.680
My Beys...

1:45:42.913 --> 1:45:46.713
...we have the right to blood,
that is a fact but...

1:45:47.680 --> 1:45:50.413
...practicing eye for an eye
is not an honor for us.

1:45:50.746 --> 1:45:55.080
The sentence for collaborating with
the Crusaders and betraying the state...

1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:58.080
...should be given by Sultan Aladdin.

1:45:58.413 --> 1:46:00.346
Does anyone have an objection?

1:46:10.180 --> 1:46:15.280
Commander Sari Bolu shall take Karatoygar
to Konya and deliver him to the palace.

1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:21.713
The lowlife dog will understand
before his last breath that...

1:46:21.946 --> 1:46:24.980
...treachery would be punished
sooner or later.

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:50.813
Commander, you are a lucky man.

1:46:51.213 --> 1:46:54.380
You will see this black pig drowning
in his own blood.

1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:20.713
We have to set on the road
to Aleppo in two days.

1:47:21.046 --> 1:47:22.980
Are the preparations completed?

1:47:23.146 --> 1:47:27.046
We have packed everything, Bey. Only
the dismantling of the carpet workshop...

1:47:27.213 --> 1:47:28.913
...and the tents are left.

1:47:29.046 --> 1:47:31.413
The herds have already
started the journey, Bey.

1:47:31.713 --> 1:47:34.713
I sent some trusted Alps
with the herders as well.

1:47:45.113 --> 1:47:50.413
Then the job of taking the agreement to
El Aziz and building the stables...

1:47:50.746 --> 1:47:53.080
...and sheep pens shall be...

1:48:00.146 --> 1:48:01.846
...yours, Gundogdu.

1:48:25.346 --> 1:48:27.013
Father, with your permission...

1:48:27.213 --> 1:48:28.880
-Father?
-Suleyman!

1:48:29.213 --> 1:48:31.113
Suleyman!

1:48:31.413 --> 1:48:33.013
-Bey?
-Father?

1:51:28.980 --> 1:51:30.480
Now it is up to you.

1:51:31.780 --> 1:51:34.746
You will go to Sultan Aladdin
and tell him everything.

1:51:35.380 --> 1:51:38.280
You will tell him that Kayis...

1:51:39.013 --> 1:51:43.180
...kidnapped the traitor Shahzades
you were taking to Konya...

1:51:44.380 --> 1:51:50.080
...then used their names to get support
from other Turkmen tribes for an uprising.

1:51:51.780 --> 1:51:56.113
They want to rise up
and overthrow Sultan Aladdin.

1:51:57.413 --> 1:52:02.246
I could not acknowledge such a thing,
so I set off on the road again...

1:52:02.746 --> 1:52:06.213
...to take the rebellious
Shahzades to Konya.

1:52:06.846 --> 1:52:12.180
They ambushed me. Killed all my soldiers.

1:52:14.346 --> 1:52:18.146
My most trusted commander, Sari Bolu.

1:52:20.746 --> 1:52:25.380
They cut his throat, right in front of me.

1:52:27.113 --> 1:52:30.846
You will take an army from
Sultan Aladdin and bring them here.

1:52:31.013 --> 1:52:34.413
Kayis will understand
why they call you the Fire of Wrath.

1:52:35.346 --> 1:52:39.713
Then you will return back to
Konya and become the right hand man...

1:52:39.913 --> 1:52:42.913
...of the sultan you have just saved.

1:52:59.113 --> 1:53:00.880
I did what I could do.

1:53:02.280 --> 1:53:05.046
Unfortunately his fever is not going down.

1:53:06.813 --> 1:53:11.413
They only thing we can do now is pray.

1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:26.246
Our Bey...

1:53:27.946 --> 1:53:33.280
...would like us to do our chores
and jobs whatever happens.

1:53:35.180 --> 1:53:37.413
We all know our jobs and chores.

1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:41.480
When he opens his eyes...

1:53:42.813 --> 1:53:45.180
...he should see that all is done.

1:53:48.413 --> 1:53:51.180
We have a long road
ahead of us to Aleppo...

1:53:52.246 --> 1:53:54.280
...but none of us shall give up.

1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:24.080
{\an8}ALEPPO

1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:49.046
Welcome back, my Sheikh.

1:55:49.380 --> 1:55:51.780
Thank you, grandson of my master.

1:55:55.313 --> 1:55:57.913
May God have his mercy over us.

1:55:58.846 --> 1:56:01.346
Your heavenly grandfather had said...

1:56:02.113 --> 1:56:04.846
...“every bird flies with their own kind.

1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:09.480
Eagles with eagles. Crows with crows.”

1:56:19.980 --> 1:56:22.080
Aleppo has become very crowded.

1:56:23.846 --> 1:56:27.013
Eagles are at one gate
and crows on the other.

1:56:27.480 --> 1:56:29.779
They all have different problems.

1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:34.180
Some are after their food, not caring
about whether it is lawful or not...

1:56:34.346 --> 1:56:40.813
...others are after a post. They don't
care whether God has given consent or not.

1:56:41.713 --> 1:56:44.213
If they have traps or bad intensions...

1:56:44.680 --> 1:56:46.780
...God has a reckoning as well.

1:56:47.446 --> 1:56:53.346
-But God is the most dutiful Trap Setter.
-Dear God. Of course.

1:57:14.713 --> 1:57:16.880
Good news for you, Selcan Hatun.

1:57:17.446 --> 1:57:19.313
Your intuition was right.

1:57:20.013 --> 1:57:25.013
From now on you will not only live for
your husband, but for your son as well.

1:57:47.846 --> 1:57:50.113
A long journey awaits Ertugrul and us.

1:57:52.680 --> 1:57:54.680
We are impatient to leave...

1:57:55.780 --> 1:57:58.813
...but this will be the hardest
journey I will be on.

1:57:59.013 --> 1:58:00.246
I know.

1:58:01.746 --> 1:58:04.446
Be my confidant, my comrade, Sultan.

1:58:11.313 --> 1:58:14.813
-If only things were different.
-If only.

1:58:17.346 --> 1:58:19.013
I heard that...

1:58:19.313 --> 1:58:21.413
...Suleyman Shah is not well.

1:58:24.913 --> 1:58:27.680
They say Azrael is walking around him.

1:58:30.346 --> 1:58:33.446
They say he waits for
his time in his deathbed.

1:58:35.413 --> 1:58:40.113
We piled more problems over his troubles.
We became a big burden for him.

1:58:41.413 --> 1:58:43.146
May God help him.

1:58:43.846 --> 1:58:45.013
Amen.

1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:55.113
Suleyman Shah said that...

1:59:01.413 --> 1:59:06.080
...Gundogdu Bey will be going to Aleppo.
She will take you there, Halime.

1:59:06.446 --> 1:59:07.880
Gundogdu Bey?

2:00:18.113 --> 2:00:20.080
Do not forget to dismantle this.

2:00:25.380 --> 2:00:28.146
Tie them well.
We have a long road ahead of us.

2:00:45.246 --> 2:00:47.080
So you came, Kurdoglu.

2:00:48.180 --> 2:00:51.780
When you hear the things I am going
to say, you will be surprised.

2:00:52.913 --> 2:00:56.446
The identities of our valuable guests
who brought...

2:00:56.680 --> 2:01:00.480
...nothing but dark clouds over our tribe
are revealed.

2:01:04.413 --> 2:01:10.480
Numan who claimed to be a trader
was actually a Seljuk Shahzade.

2:01:19.413 --> 2:01:23.346
But what is your intention
in telling me this news, Selcan Hatun?

2:01:24.913 --> 2:01:28.746
I saw what you can do with
a small bit of information, Kurdoglu.

2:01:41.013 --> 2:01:43.846
My father and Uncle Kurdoglu
went on a hunt one day.

2:01:44.046 --> 2:01:46.113
They were both around our ages then.

2:01:46.313 --> 2:01:50.446
-Uncle Kurdoglu fell of his horse.
-Why? Did something happen to the horse?

2:01:50.813 --> 2:01:54.380
The horse had startled because
there was a big bear in front of them.

2:01:55.280 --> 2:01:56.780
What did Kurdoglu do?

2:01:57.813 --> 2:02:00.713
My uncle could not do anything
because his leg was broken.

2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:03.413
When that bear was about to
tear my uncle apart...

2:02:03.746 --> 2:02:06.280
...my father came and
killed the bear with his spear.

2:02:07.046 --> 2:02:08.746
You father is very brave.

2:02:08.913 --> 2:02:10.946
They became blood brothers then.

2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:14.880
Yigit, you will be going tomorrow.

2:02:15.446 --> 2:02:19.313
When you go, please don’t forget that
you have a brother in Kayi tribe.

2:02:42.280 --> 2:02:43.480
Let us go.

2:02:48.113 --> 2:02:49.213
Yigit...

2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:51.913
...look.

2:02:57.413 --> 2:02:58.446
Run.

2:03:58.013 --> 2:04:01.213
Dear God, Who has given secrets
to us herbalists...

2:04:01.413 --> 2:04:04.080
...spare us from troubles without remedy.

2:04:09.980 --> 2:04:11.113
They are upstairs.

2:04:25.680 --> 2:04:27.213
Welcome, Nasir.

2:04:33.946 --> 2:04:35.446
You called for me, sir.

2:04:36.913 --> 2:04:43.913
Go to El Aziz immediately and tell him to
stop Kayis from settling at our borders.

2:04:44.813 --> 2:04:48.246
-But, sir, Titus...
-I cannot waste time by talking about...

2:04:48.413 --> 2:04:50.480
...the stupid decisions Titus made.

2:04:51.780 --> 2:04:56.680
He is only a pawn
who thinks he is a vizier.

2:04:57.813 --> 2:05:00.846
It is very hard to dissuade
El Aziz from his decision.

2:05:01.713 --> 2:05:03.413
He really liked the Kayis.

2:05:05.046 --> 2:05:12.013
Is his love for Kayis so big that
he is prepared to let black death...

2:05:12.280 --> 2:05:15.946
...roam over Aleppo?

2:05:28.313 --> 2:05:32.713
Did you manage to find the person
who sent the spies to kill Ertugrul?

2:05:33.913 --> 2:05:38.446
According to the information I have, the
Templars have mobilized all their spies.

2:05:39.313 --> 2:05:42.346
I am trying to uncover
their sources within the palace.

2:05:44.480 --> 2:05:46.380
Come, Nasir, come. Come.

2:05:49.946 --> 2:05:53.746
Sir, the problem is important,
I did not want to wait for the morning.

2:05:55.880 --> 2:05:59.346
Intelligence have been informing
about the plague in Anatolia.

2:05:59.713 --> 2:06:04.380
I wanted to be sure whether our potential
allies have been plagued or not.

2:06:05.480 --> 2:06:09.380
Sir, I know, you liked Kayis very much.

2:06:11.113 --> 2:06:15.013
I also believe that they are
most suitable for holding our borders...

2:06:15.146 --> 2:06:17.013
...if a new Crusader campaign starts.

2:06:17.146 --> 2:06:19.413
-But...
-But what, Nasir?

2:06:21.946 --> 2:06:25.246
Sir, unfortunately
most of their livestock have perished.

2:06:27.013 --> 2:06:28.180
Don’t...

2:06:29.080 --> 2:06:31.813
...reject them from our borders, Nasir.

2:06:31.946 --> 2:06:34.080
Do you understand? Don’t.

2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:40.746
When he brings the agreement,
I personally want to talk with Ertugrul.

2:06:57.180 --> 2:07:00.946
Come on now, Gundogdu.
All the Beys have gathered in the tent.

2:07:01.380 --> 2:07:02.846
Today is the day.

2:07:04.180 --> 2:07:06.913
Do not talk like
my father has died, Kurdoglu.

2:07:07.913 --> 2:07:12.080
You are the tribe’s son as much as
you are your father’s son, Gundogdu.

2:07:12.380 --> 2:07:16.346
Will you sit in your tent like
a woman while your tribe is in trouble?

2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:24.280
As we move down to the plains from
the highlands the troubles shall cease...

2:07:24.480 --> 2:07:26.280
...and my father will get well.

2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:28.780
I have nothing else to say, Kurdoglu.

2:07:29.146 --> 2:07:33.446
Do you know what you will face while going
down to the plains from the highlands?

2:07:34.480 --> 2:07:36.680
What are you trying to say, Emmi?

2:07:37.280 --> 2:07:38.980
I am saying that...

2:07:40.313 --> 2:07:43.080
...this path we are taking
is not wise, son.

2:07:45.246 --> 2:07:47.880
This is the headquarter’s decision
and my father’s order.

2:07:48.013 --> 2:07:49.980
This is my final word, Kurdoglu.

2:07:51.013 --> 2:07:53.946
Do you think that I want to be
the acting Bey...

2:07:55.913 --> 2:07:58.680
...and to sit in the marquee
under your father’s shadow?

2:07:59.113 --> 2:08:00.680
Don’t you know me, Gundogdu?

2:08:01.213 --> 2:08:05.213
Wasn’t it you who said your father is
too old to perform his Bey duties...

2:08:05.380 --> 2:08:07.846
...and asked me support you
to become the new Bey?

2:08:07.980 --> 2:08:11.080
Didn’t I tell you that I would be
supporting you until the end?

2:08:11.680 --> 2:08:13.180
What is your cause now?

2:08:15.213 --> 2:08:17.913
I am an old man with only
a few years to live.

2:08:18.113 --> 2:08:23.146
I told you numerous times that the tribe
needs a brave, determined Bey like you.

2:08:24.413 --> 2:08:28.113
I would like you to trust me
until I save you from these problems...

2:08:28.313 --> 2:08:30.946
...and make you a Bey in our new home.

2:08:34.180 --> 2:08:35.846
Come to the point, Emmi.

2:08:36.946 --> 2:08:41.180
I have learned the real identity
the ominous guests Ertugrul brought here.

2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:48.780
I know that Numan and his son are from
the Seljuk dynasty, they are Shahzades.

2:08:48.980 --> 2:08:53.446
<i>Those people who you call faceless</i>
 <i>are from the Seljuk dynasty, Hatun.</i>

2:08:54.413 --> 2:08:59.380
<i>The man called Numan is a Shahzade and</i>
 <i>that girl you look down on, is a sultan.</i>

2:09:04.180 --> 2:09:06.046
If we deliver them...

2:09:07.380 --> 2:09:09.413
...the Sultan would award our tribe.

2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:14.746
We can settle in the best places of
Seljuk territory.

2:09:17.713 --> 2:09:19.813
What do you want from me, Kurdoglu?

2:09:23.280 --> 2:09:25.013
Give up on Aleppo.

2:09:27.746 --> 2:09:29.780
Aleppo will be our doom.

2:09:30.346 --> 2:09:32.246
We should take them tonight...

2:09:33.846 --> 2:09:36.246
...and deliver them
to the Sultan, Gundogdu.

2:09:53.046 --> 2:09:56.680
May God spare you for us and Kayis.

2:11:42.213 --> 2:11:43.380
Bey...

2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:46.246
...we are ready for the ambush.

0:02:07.715 --> 0:02:09.715
