{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

0:01:51.166 --> 0:01:54.800
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

0:01:55.200 --> 0:01:58.200
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

0:12:59.433 --> 0:13:00.766
Turgut!

0:14:00.933 --> 0:14:02.233
The boy is dead.

0:14:07.033 --> 0:14:08.233
Yigit Alp!

0:14:16.300 --> 0:14:18.733
Let them go or I will kill you all.

0:14:18.900 --> 0:14:21.233
Do you think we are stupid?
Get out of our way.

0:14:21.400 --> 0:14:25.766
I thought I made myself clear. You either
let them go or I will kill you all.

0:14:26.300 --> 0:14:29.266
I won’t. Get out of the way or
I will kill the girl.

0:14:35.233 --> 0:14:37.500
This is my last warning! Let them go!

0:14:43.866 --> 0:14:46.866
Yigit Alp. Yigit Alp!

0:15:27.366 --> 0:15:28.766
Who are you?

0:15:31.833 --> 0:15:33.033
Afsin.

0:15:33.866 --> 0:15:35.233
And I am Deli.

0:15:53.500 --> 0:15:55.166
Look at the scholar.

0:15:56.333 --> 0:15:57.500
He fights well.

0:15:57.800 --> 0:16:00.100
He may be a scholar but he is on fire!

0:16:19.166 --> 0:16:20.400
My brother...

0:16:21.033 --> 0:16:22.433
...how is your wound?

0:16:23.766 --> 0:16:26.933
The tip is broken inside.
We should take it out immediately.

0:16:27.500 --> 0:16:30.866
We cannot do it here. We should leave.
Others might come as well.

0:16:31.000 --> 0:16:34.000
The arrow stops the blood.
We will cut it somewhere else.

0:16:44.000 --> 0:16:46.000
This is all Karatoygar’s doing.

0:16:47.866 --> 0:16:48.933
Let’s go.

0:16:51.033 --> 0:16:53.100
{\an8}KARATOYGAR INN.

0:16:54.100 --> 0:16:55.766
You messed it all up!

0:16:58.066 --> 0:17:00.366
First your knights...

0:17:00.733 --> 0:17:02.400
...then my soldiers.

0:17:02.766 --> 0:17:05.233
He killed them all like mosquitoes.

0:17:05.400 --> 0:17:10.900
You and I made a very big mistake
by underestimating Ertugrul.

0:17:11.166 --> 0:17:13.233
From now on never...

0:17:14.200 --> 0:17:19.133
...never try to command me.
I will settle this issue my own way.

0:17:20.333 --> 0:17:22.866
Not on my territory, Titus.

0:17:23.866 --> 0:17:27.733
If Sultan Aladdin hears about it,
our plan would be ruined.

0:17:28.933 --> 0:17:33.466
You said that you would settle this issue
and I obliged. But you messed up.

0:17:33.833 --> 0:17:38.100
You let Ertugrul escape!
I will settle it my own way!

0:17:40.000 --> 0:17:44.900
My door is always open for you, Titus.
But...

0:17:45.733 --> 0:17:51.133
...I am saying it again,
if you go on a headhunt in my territory...

0:17:51.733 --> 0:17:53.833
...you will lose your own heads.

0:17:54.233 --> 0:17:55.833
What about in Aleppo?

0:18:01.966 --> 0:18:07.133
What did you think? We have more skillful
servants than you in all the Muslim world.

0:18:07.866 --> 0:18:09.900
And know this, Karatoygar...

0:18:10.433 --> 0:18:14.766
...if you were not Ustad-i Azam’s dog,
I would have killed you long ago.

0:19:18.733 --> 0:19:20.366
Look at the great Gundogdu.

0:19:22.700 --> 0:19:25.766
Yes, you see, Selcan Hatun...

0:19:27.066 --> 0:19:30.166
...they tame Gundogdu like this,
so you know.

0:19:30.500 --> 0:19:35.466
You don’t get angry, you don’t build up
a rage, what is wrong with you, Gundogdu?

0:19:37.100 --> 0:19:39.733
I am only waiting for
the right time, Hatun.

0:19:42.500 --> 0:19:44.766
Thank God. Thank you as well.

0:19:44.966 --> 0:19:46.300
May it be healthy.

0:19:47.933 --> 0:19:51.433
What is on your mind?
Will you refrain from tell me as well?

0:19:51.900 --> 0:19:54.833
Hatun, I was wronged when I was right.

0:19:55.200 --> 0:19:57.933
Look, I also got punished for it as well.

0:19:58.500 --> 0:20:01.333
I cannot digest this, Hatun.
When the time comes...

0:20:01.500 --> 0:20:03.966
...the whole tribe will see
who Gundogdu is.

0:20:04.433 --> 0:20:07.233
Don’t let your fury cloud
your judgment, please.

0:20:07.766 --> 0:20:11.500
Selcan, winter is around the corner.
It is knocking on our door.

0:20:11.866 --> 0:20:14.033
Karatoygar made his first move.

0:20:14.200 --> 0:20:18.066
Won’t they say that Kayi could not even
protect their guests?

0:20:19.500 --> 0:20:24.733
Won’t they? If it wasn’t for the trader’s
man, the guests would have been kidnapped.

0:20:24.900 --> 0:20:28.000
-Do you know what this means?
-What does it mean, Gundogdu?

0:20:28.166 --> 0:20:32.366
It means this tribe is not led.
It does not have a Bey, it has no one.

0:20:34.266 --> 0:20:36.000
What will happen then?

0:20:36.200 --> 0:20:40.866
If I am keeping quiet, if I am not tearing
everything apart, there is a reason.

0:20:41.300 --> 0:20:43.333
Now I have to be patient.

0:20:45.466 --> 0:20:46.866
Now let me work.

0:20:55.400 --> 0:21:00.200
I told you to increase the security.
What did you do? Nothing.

0:21:00.933 --> 0:21:04.433
Because of your incompetence,
the men of that dog infiltrated our camp.

0:21:04.766 --> 0:21:06.966
My honor and the tribe’s honor
was violated.

0:21:07.133 --> 0:21:10.933
-I took all measures for maximum security.
-Then how could they get in?

0:21:11.133 --> 0:21:12.333
How?

0:21:12.466 --> 0:21:15.866
They could not have done it
without help from inside, Bey.

0:21:16.366 --> 0:21:18.066
What does this mean?

0:21:19.033 --> 0:21:21.400
Is something like this possible, Kurdoglu?

0:21:22.233 --> 0:21:25.733
There is no one in our tribe
who would stoop so low, Bey.

0:21:25.966 --> 0:21:28.700
Your head of guard
is struggling to save himself.

0:21:28.833 --> 0:21:32.133
He is so belittled that
he can’t even hear his own words.

0:21:32.500 --> 0:21:37.299
You are not my head of guard anymore.
Gather all the guards on duty yesterday...

0:21:37.433 --> 0:21:40.299
...and wait for my decision
on your punishment.

0:21:40.733 --> 0:21:42.233
As you wish, Bey.

0:21:50.733 --> 0:21:54.733
If Karatoygar has the nerve to raid
my tribe to kidnap our guests...

0:21:54.933 --> 0:21:58.100
...I don’t know
what he would dare tomorrow.

0:21:59.933 --> 0:22:04.400
Bey, give me permission to go
and talk with him once again.

0:22:04.733 --> 0:22:07.833
What did you achieve last time?
He made a fool of you.

0:22:08.266 --> 0:22:10.433
You still ask to go and talk with him.

0:22:10.733 --> 0:22:14.133
He learned his lesson, Bey.
All the men he sent was killed.

0:22:15.166 --> 0:22:18.233
Now, I can talk in a language
he can understand.

0:22:20.433 --> 0:22:23.033
I know the language he would understand.

0:22:24.233 --> 0:22:27.033
Load the bodies to horses
and send back to him.

0:22:27.200 --> 0:22:30.100
From now on, we will talk the way
he would understand.

0:22:30.266 --> 0:22:34.833
Bey, what can we do against
the great Seljuk army?

0:22:35.900 --> 0:22:39.700
Don’t talk like the army is here,
Kurdoglu. It would take days for...

0:22:39.833 --> 0:22:43.066
...Karatoygar to mobilize the army
in Erzincan and bring it here.

0:22:43.233 --> 0:22:47.900
Anyhow, if Karatoygar didn’t have a hidden
agenda, he would have acted long ago.

0:22:48.800 --> 0:22:52.066
He is violating the agreement I did
with the Sultan and acting on his own.

0:22:52.466 --> 0:22:55.866
Actually, as a commander he has enough
experience to know that I would crush...

0:22:56.133 --> 0:22:57.466
...his few hundred soldiers.

0:22:58.966 --> 0:23:00.133
Then what?

0:23:03.000 --> 0:23:05.300
The rest is up to Ertugrul’s success.

0:23:06.133 --> 0:23:09.200
One way or another,
whatever our customs say shall prevail.

0:23:15.500 --> 0:23:17.266
What will happen now, Akcakoca?

0:23:17.433 --> 0:23:19.933
This will take away the pus of the wound.

0:23:20.833 --> 0:23:23.000
It will enable him to recover quickly.

0:23:23.866 --> 0:23:26.433
-Take this.
-If God permits. How is he?

0:23:26.933 --> 0:23:29.900
This was not welcome before
he recovered fully but...

0:23:30.066 --> 0:23:32.233
...there is no need to be afraid.
Do not worry.

0:23:32.400 --> 0:23:35.433
The healing process will be delayed
for a few days, that’s all.

0:23:35.766 --> 0:23:39.066
When you feel better, you should get up,
walk around a bit outside...

0:23:39.233 --> 0:23:41.066
...it would do you good, alright?

0:23:41.800 --> 0:23:45.700
Do not neglect to smear this ointment
on the wound three times a day.

0:23:50.833 --> 0:23:54.166
-Thank you very much, Akcakoca.
-Alright, may God be on your side.

0:23:54.333 --> 0:23:55.900
Thank you, Akcakoca.

0:24:05.400 --> 0:24:09.066
Please do not try to get up.
I just came to wish you a speedy recovery.

0:24:09.733 --> 0:24:13.300
Take these and feed your father well
so that he can get well quickly.

0:24:13.466 --> 0:24:17.433
-I owe you not one, but three lives.
-There is no debt.

0:24:17.833 --> 0:24:21.900
If you could grant me your name,
I would know the man I am thankful to.

0:24:32.133 --> 0:24:33.866
Come close, young boy.

0:24:38.266 --> 0:24:41.300
-What is this?
-This necklace belongs to your family.

0:24:41.866 --> 0:24:43.800
To the Seljuk dynasty.

0:25:16.766 --> 0:25:19.500
-Dogan, Bamsi, help him down.
-At once, Bey.

0:25:32.200 --> 0:25:33.966
Come on, let us go.

0:25:38.500 --> 0:25:39.800
My arm.

0:25:43.366 --> 0:25:44.866
My arm is bleeding.

0:25:45.000 --> 0:25:47.133
Dogan, Bamsi, fetch some wood.

0:25:52.500 --> 0:25:53.866
Drink this.

0:25:58.133 --> 0:25:59.800
He lost a lot of blood.

0:26:04.366 --> 0:26:07.233
-Come on, brother, raise your head.
-Raise your head.

0:26:24.000 --> 0:26:25.066
Ertugrul.

0:26:30.400 --> 0:26:32.900
-What happened, son?
-We were attacked.

0:26:44.933 --> 0:26:48.866
Didn’t I warn you to be careful and
say that the air is hazy around here.

0:26:53.333 --> 0:26:55.166
Dervish, bring the saddlebag.

0:26:57.433 --> 0:26:59.800
We need to stop the bleeding immediately.

0:27:00.000 --> 0:27:03.200
Part of the arrow is inside,
we need to take it out first.

0:27:03.366 --> 0:27:05.466
We can manage, with God’s help.

0:27:13.000 --> 0:27:14.200
Who are they?

0:27:21.300 --> 0:27:22.800
Be strong, my friend.

0:27:31.966 --> 0:27:34.000
In the name of God. Come on.

0:27:56.266 --> 0:27:59.900
-Hopefully he will live.
-Bamsi, don’t open your foreboding mouth.

0:28:02.200 --> 0:28:06.366
Do not worry.
Fate protects a person from death.

0:28:13.133 --> 0:28:16.233
I served under your little brother
Melik Rukneddin.

0:28:16.966 --> 0:28:19.233
And my name is Semseddin Afsin Bey.

0:28:19.800 --> 0:28:23.166
Your brother died in my arms.
The necklace belonged to him.

0:28:24.100 --> 0:28:27.766
-You are Afsin Bey.
-That is correct, Shahzade.

0:28:28.366 --> 0:28:32.133
I heard your name before.
You were a good commander.

0:28:32.366 --> 0:28:36.700
-Thank you.
-But, how do I know that you are him?

0:28:38.066 --> 0:28:41.400
That this is not a play
staged by Sultan Aladdin?

0:28:42.400 --> 0:28:46.033
Afsin Bey,
why did you risk your life for us?

0:28:46.966 --> 0:28:50.366
Your brother was my Shahzade.
But more importantly...

0:28:50.700 --> 0:28:53.033
...your attitude toward Sultan Aladdin.

0:28:53.200 --> 0:28:57.266
You did not engage in a power struggle.
You stayed loyal to the state.

0:28:57.700 --> 0:29:01.100
You refrained from making moves
that would overshadow his successes.

0:29:01.233 --> 0:29:05.100
You didn’t cast a shadow over Seljuk’s
bright days with an ambition of power.

0:29:05.400 --> 0:29:08.700
That is why you deserve
the utmost respect, sir.

0:29:09.166 --> 0:29:13.466
With your permission, I would like to
help you escape from Karatoygar.

0:29:13.966 --> 0:29:17.433
How? It is obvious that someone
helped Karatoygar to get in.

0:29:17.833 --> 0:29:20.966
Otherwise, they could not have
entered the camp so easily.

0:29:22.366 --> 0:29:25.500
I don’t know who but
I know what he will do next.

0:29:26.766 --> 0:29:28.033
Halime?

0:29:32.333 --> 0:29:35.466
Than God. My God give you inner peace.

0:29:36.066 --> 0:29:38.200
-Thank you, my girl.
-Please, sit.

0:29:38.466 --> 0:29:41.200
I should not bother you, sir.
You should rest.

0:29:41.466 --> 0:29:45.000
With your permission,
I will take Halime from you for a while.

0:29:45.166 --> 0:29:48.733
Mother Hayme is worried about you,
she would like to ask her how you are.

0:29:48.866 --> 0:29:51.400
Of course. The permission is yours.

0:30:09.033 --> 0:30:11.266
Why did Mother Hayme
want to see me, Aykiz?

0:30:11.466 --> 0:30:15.800
I really don’t know either.
But you don’t need to be cautious, Halime.

0:30:20.233 --> 0:30:22.833
They are being punished
because of us, right?

0:30:24.166 --> 0:30:26.800
They deserved the punishment they get.

0:30:30.333 --> 0:30:32.766
Bey’s honor is our honor as well.

0:30:34.333 --> 0:30:35.700
Come on now.

0:30:38.166 --> 0:30:40.066
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS.
TEMPLARS CASTLE.

0:30:40.400 --> 0:30:44.100
The Muslims we killed
stirred up emotions as expected.

0:30:45.866 --> 0:30:48.333
The whole Muslim world is in rage.

0:30:49.166 --> 0:30:52.066
They will start attacking
the Christians soon.

0:30:52.733 --> 0:30:55.200
Europe cannot sit back then.

0:30:55.466 --> 0:30:58.200
Ustad-i Azam,
what will we do when they attack us?

0:30:58.366 --> 0:31:00.966
We have limited number of
knights and soldiers.

0:31:01.233 --> 0:31:03.300
We will attack them as well.

0:31:03.766 --> 0:31:08.800
I forged up such an army, which no army
will be able to stand against.

0:31:09.700 --> 0:31:13.233
From Palestine to Basra,
from Baghdad to Aleppo...

0:31:13.433 --> 0:31:17.366
...everywhere will be covered
by the stench of burnt bodies.

0:31:28.500 --> 0:31:31.266
The visitors you had been expecting
have arrived, sir.

0:31:32.133 --> 0:31:33.266
Good.

0:31:34.466 --> 0:31:37.466
Come now.
Let me show you my invincible army.

0:31:56.466 --> 0:31:58.466
Son of a Bey should be like this.

0:31:58.866 --> 0:31:59.933
Hamza.

0:32:01.866 --> 0:32:05.000
I am paying the price of
being presumptuous, uncle. That is all.

0:32:05.166 --> 0:32:08.133
-Good for you, my nephew.
-The ambush last night...

0:32:12.333 --> 0:32:15.133
It was obvious that Karatoygar
would not back down.

0:32:19.733 --> 0:32:23.333
Did you know about
the ambush beforehand, uncle?

0:32:26.466 --> 0:32:32.700
Thank God we have a Bey’s son whom,
for his father, even suspects his uncle.

0:32:32.866 --> 0:32:37.000
Moreover, he questions him while
looking into his eyes.

0:32:40.700 --> 0:32:42.933
Our Bey has the same suspicions.

0:32:43.166 --> 0:32:46.033
Our guests must be more precious
than we thought.

0:32:47.700 --> 0:32:50.333
Come to my tent in the evening,
we will talk there.

0:32:50.700 --> 0:32:54.866
We need to get rid of this problem before
trouble surrounds us from all sides.

0:33:17.966 --> 0:33:20.833
May it be easy on you, Mother Hayme.
Do we have permission?

0:33:21.000 --> 0:33:22.900
You do, my girl, you do. Come in.

0:33:28.233 --> 0:33:30.333
Come and sit, my beautiful girls.

0:33:37.733 --> 0:33:40.966
I am sorry for what happened.
Thank God no one was killed.

0:33:41.433 --> 0:33:45.333
Thank God, Mother Hayme.
My father’s wound was uncalled for...

0:33:45.800 --> 0:33:48.400
...while he was recovering
but thank God he was spared.

0:33:50.233 --> 0:33:53.833
But why are these devil mongers
imposing you?

0:33:54.466 --> 0:33:59.266
My father is a trader, when he was
transporting goods in the Mediterranean...

0:34:00.000 --> 0:34:04.700
...we fell captive to the Crusaders.
They wanted to sell us to Karatoygar.

0:34:07.200 --> 0:34:11.700
When you are dwelled in so much trouble,
don’t you have anyone to turn to?

0:34:11.833 --> 0:34:13.833
Which tribe do you belong to?

0:34:18.466 --> 0:34:22.200
-We are from Kinik tribe.
-So you are from Kinik tribe?

0:34:22.500 --> 0:34:26.500
You carry the blood of the Bey
who founded the Seljuk state, is that so?

0:34:26.833 --> 0:34:29.966
Well, which clan from the
Kinik tribe do you belong to?

0:34:38.933 --> 0:34:42.166
-Do we have permission, Mother Hayme?
-Yes, you do. Come, my girl.

0:34:43.066 --> 0:34:45.333
-Did you bring the drapes?
-I did, Mother.

0:34:59.866 --> 0:35:01.166
The colors are faded.

0:35:03.333 --> 0:35:05.333
What did you lack in material?

0:35:06.000 --> 0:35:10.400
There is not enough grass due to famine.
We had to water down the dye.

0:35:11.033 --> 0:35:14.133
We are doing all we can,
but this is the best we could do.

0:35:18.066 --> 0:35:20.966
Did you try the leaves and
roots of dyer’s woad?

0:35:26.066 --> 0:35:28.233
Our trader girl knows so much.

0:35:28.833 --> 0:35:32.133
She learned so many things
as she traveled the seas and mountains...

0:35:32.300 --> 0:35:35.366
...but she forgets that grass
don’t grow during famine.

0:35:35.500 --> 0:35:38.033
If there was some, we would have used it.

0:35:38.200 --> 0:35:41.966
Selcan is right, my girl.
We need to find another solution.

0:35:42.933 --> 0:35:46.833
We don’t have much time left. We have
to go and sell these in the market...

0:35:47.000 --> 0:35:50.433
...before we migrate but we don’t have
a single proper drape to sell.

0:35:54.333 --> 0:35:56.800
Selcan, do your best.

0:35:58.933 --> 0:36:00.200
You may leave.

0:36:03.933 --> 0:36:06.700
Do not meddle in things
that does not concern you.

0:36:27.966 --> 0:36:32.100
You are the dearest subjects
who will be going to God’s heaven.

0:36:32.700 --> 0:36:36.266
You will find peace
in the compassionate embrace of Jesus.

0:36:36.833 --> 0:36:38.766
You tasted death while alive...

0:36:38.933 --> 0:36:43.766
...and now you will taste the peace of
redemption from all sins while you die.

0:37:01.800 --> 0:37:03.000
Mario!

0:37:43.700 --> 0:37:49.300
Rachel, my dear girl, you will find
the peace you seek in God’s heaven.

0:37:50.833 --> 0:37:54.366
You know how much I trust your
intelligence and thus I gave you...

0:37:54.700 --> 0:37:59.266
...the most difficult task.
Your task will be the Kayi Tribe.

0:37:59.866 --> 0:38:02.333
Two knights of mine will accompany you.

0:38:07.266 --> 0:38:11.166
My whole life was in unbearable pain, sir.
But my death will be...

0:38:11.333 --> 0:38:14.133
...with the love of Jesus and honor.

0:38:15.766 --> 0:38:18.933
My innocent lambs,
may you have a clear journey.

0:38:26.733 --> 0:38:28.900
We did not understand your plan, sir.

0:38:29.266 --> 0:38:31.433
Black death, my dear knight.

0:38:32.233 --> 0:38:36.800
This small but powerful army
will spread the damnation of devil...

0:38:37.000 --> 0:38:39.100
...all over the Muslim world.

0:38:46.933 --> 0:38:48.766
Wait, stop there.

0:38:49.733 --> 0:38:51.866
Do not worry. There is a way.

0:38:52.399 --> 0:38:54.033
Come and sit here.

0:38:59.100 --> 0:39:03.766
Look, my girl. Years ago one old woman
in the palace did something...

0:39:03.933 --> 0:39:06.733
...to make the colors more vibrant.

0:39:09.066 --> 0:39:11.433
The whole palace was surprised.

0:39:12.033 --> 0:39:16.966
Even my late grandfather who was
the Sultan at the time was intrigued.

0:39:18.466 --> 0:39:25.433
Everyone was against the poor woman. But
the colors on the drape were magnificent.

0:39:25.966 --> 0:39:27.933
What did she do, father, tell me.

0:39:30.900 --> 0:39:36.866
That is all. We set on the road from
Andalusia years ago and never looked back.

0:39:38.033 --> 0:39:40.233
What made you leave your home, dervish?

0:39:40.466 --> 0:39:41.966
A dream.

0:39:43.766 --> 0:39:48.966
I am pursuing the divine call that made me
travel everywhere in the world for years.

0:39:52.433 --> 0:39:56.333
-Is there a clan called Andalusia?
-Didn’t you ever hear of Andalusia?

0:39:56.966 --> 0:39:58.933
-Never, brother.
-Really?

0:39:59.166 --> 0:40:03.000
-Am I lying to you?
-Sometimes I wonder why you carry a head.

0:40:03.166 --> 0:40:05.833
-Doesn’t it get too heavy?
-Leave me alone.

0:40:09.766 --> 0:40:12.400
What about you, son?
Why are you going to Aleppo?

0:40:13.933 --> 0:40:16.400
I was sent to Ameer El Aziz
as an ambassador.

0:40:17.066 --> 0:40:21.400
-But we still couldn’t reach.
-You will, if God permits.

0:40:24.300 --> 0:40:29.233
While his highness the Prophet and
his highness Abu Bakr was migrating...

0:40:29.433 --> 0:40:33.033
...they took refuge in a cave.
The heretics were after them.

0:40:33.433 --> 0:40:36.266
They found the tracks
that go inside the cave.

0:40:36.433 --> 0:40:42.800
The companion of our Prophet, Abu Bakr
was anxious. Our Prophet said to him:

0:40:43.333 --> 0:40:46.866
“Don’t you worry, Abu Bakr,
God is with us.”

0:40:48.200 --> 0:40:53.733
There, a small spider weaved them
the most protective armor of all time.

0:40:54.466 --> 0:41:00.400
So the real question is whether we made
God a companion to our road or not.

0:41:01.133 --> 0:41:05.700
If we did, all doors would open,
all roads would finish.

0:41:06.033 --> 0:41:09.833
If we did not,
our companion would be the devil.

0:41:10.700 --> 0:41:13.066
-Peace be upon you.
-The devil!

0:41:13.333 --> 0:41:16.400
-Shut your mouth.
-And peace be upon you!

0:41:17.266 --> 0:41:18.966
And peace be upon you

0:41:20.033 --> 0:41:22.900
We saw the fire and came.
Do we have permission?

0:41:27.433 --> 0:41:29.466
Please join us at our humble dinner.

0:41:54.500 --> 0:41:59.300
If Karatoygar attacked our camp so easily,
he must have a spy inside.

0:42:00.766 --> 0:42:04.933
No one in Kayi Tribe would dare
to be a spy for Karatoygar.

0:42:06.733 --> 0:42:08.733
What did you talk with Karatoygar?

0:42:12.900 --> 0:42:16.300
I asked for some time,
to convince Suleyman Shah.

0:42:17.933 --> 0:42:20.233
He attacked before the time was up.

0:42:20.500 --> 0:42:23.333
We cannot even protect the people
who take refuge in us.

0:42:23.700 --> 0:42:26.200
Old age made Suleyman Shah very weak.

0:42:27.133 --> 0:42:30.400
The unity and solidarity
of the tribe is at risk, Gundogdu.

0:42:30.766 --> 0:42:34.100
If we don’t act,
the great Kayi tribe will fall apart.

0:42:35.400 --> 0:42:40.066
He is my father but the future
of the tribe is more important.

0:42:41.033 --> 0:42:42.866
What do you have in mind?

0:42:43.100 --> 0:42:45.866
I will wait for Ertugrul
to return from Aleppo.

0:42:46.066 --> 0:42:49.400
If he comes back empty handed,
I will act immediately.

0:42:50.733 --> 0:42:52.233
What about your father?

0:42:53.033 --> 0:42:58.133
My father is my life and blood but
I would act accordingly to Oguz customs.

0:43:06.466 --> 0:43:10.766
Oguz customs tell so much to those
who know how to listen.

0:43:18.433 --> 0:43:22.133
We are on the road for days without food.
We were devastated.

0:43:24.866 --> 0:43:28.300
But I thank God that
he put you on our way.

0:43:29.333 --> 0:43:32.933
We can never know from where
the fortune would smile at us.

0:43:35.033 --> 0:43:39.066
True. We can never know from where
the trouble will come either.

0:43:39.333 --> 0:43:41.933
What is the matter?
Did something bad happen?

0:43:42.066 --> 0:43:46.866
While our caravan was on the road,
the crusaders, those Templars attacked us.

0:43:47.966 --> 0:43:51.033
They seize every opportunity
and attack everywhere.

0:43:51.266 --> 0:43:55.100
Last time we met a regiment of crusaders.
We killed them all!

0:43:59.066 --> 0:44:00.333
You did well.

0:44:02.733 --> 0:44:08.233
Those crusaders, where did they get the
courage to wander in the Muslim territory?

0:44:09.066 --> 0:44:12.866
I heard that those heretics
are preparing for a new crusade.

0:44:13.233 --> 0:44:18.700
They mobilized the whole Christian world
to invade Jerusalem.

0:44:19.866 --> 0:44:25.233
I heard that they killed all the important
rulers in the Muslim states one by one...

0:44:27.366 --> 0:44:30.400
...and left their bodies in town squares.

0:44:35.400 --> 0:44:39.733
So we will have a festival.
We will need to prepare a warm welcome.

0:44:43.100 --> 0:44:49.100
You jest, Bey. How will this be?
Muslims only draw swords at each other.

0:44:49.400 --> 0:44:52.100
-They kill each other.
-Don’t you worry.

0:44:53.400 --> 0:44:58.266
God would bear a big warrior and
unite the whole world under his flag.

0:44:59.133 --> 0:45:04.233
And his progeny would conquer
Constantinople, take Jerusalem...

0:45:05.200 --> 0:45:07.700
...and serve Mecca and Medina.

0:45:09.500 --> 0:45:13.966
If God permits, we shall fight under
the flag of that warrior.

0:45:19.133 --> 0:45:23.133
If God permits.
I hope you are right, if God permits.

0:45:24.000 --> 0:45:28.133
I hope He sends that warrior soon
so that we can find peace, if God permits.

0:45:30.900 --> 0:45:35.900
I would like to know these valuable God
followers who shared their food with us.

0:45:38.133 --> 0:45:39.700
I am...

0:45:39.966 --> 0:45:42.366
...Ibn Arabi from Andalusia.

0:45:45.200 --> 0:45:46.800
Ertugrul from Kayi Tribe.

0:45:46.801 --> 0:02:58.874


0:45:52.700 --> 0:45:54.600
I brought you molasses, father.

0:45:54.966 --> 0:45:57.400
-Thank you, my girl.
-May it be health.

0:46:01.700 --> 0:46:04.700
Well? Tell us now, Gundogdu.

0:46:06.200 --> 0:46:09.300
What do you want to do and
require Oguz customs?

0:46:12.266 --> 0:46:16.566
If I was a Bey and someone
attacked my tribe...

0:46:17.500 --> 0:46:22.133
...I would think about the punishment
I would give to the soldiers on guard.

0:46:25.933 --> 0:46:28.066
What would you have done, Kurdoglu?

0:46:30.233 --> 0:46:35.566
I say, Bey, the punishment given by
Suleyman Shah is well deserved.

0:46:39.000 --> 0:46:45.400
Son, one day you may be Bey.
Look for the answer to this question then.

0:46:47.100 --> 0:46:51.066
Now, do not busy your mind
on unnecessary business.

0:46:51.466 --> 0:46:55.166
Just think about how you can do
your own task the best you can.

0:46:55.966 --> 0:46:58.900
-What task is this?
-Starting from tomorrow...

0:46:59.066 --> 0:47:02.633
...you shall be collecting
the goods to be sold in the caravan.

0:47:03.133 --> 0:47:06.000
The caravan shall set on
the road in three days.

0:47:06.166 --> 0:47:09.500
Bey, why doesn’t the trader
take the goods?

0:47:09.966 --> 0:47:13.299
Karatoygar has bad intensions.
He might raid the caravan.

0:47:13.533 --> 0:47:16.566
That is why we can’t give
the goods to the trader.

0:47:17.633 --> 0:47:20.300
Gundogdu will do this task with his Alps.

0:47:20.466 --> 0:47:21.966
As you wish, father.

0:47:26.100 --> 0:47:29.266
You invited me to your table,
shared your food...

0:47:29.466 --> 0:47:32.933
...I shall never forget this kindness.
-May it be health.

0:47:33.566 --> 0:47:37.300
I would like permission to leave.
I need to be on my way.

0:47:37.566 --> 0:47:39.666
The roads would be dangerous at night.

0:47:39.966 --> 0:47:41.600
We can go together at sunrise.

0:47:41.900 --> 0:47:44.533
Thank you but I have not seen
my family for months.

0:47:44.666 --> 0:47:47.166
I would not want to make
them worry anymore.

0:47:47.400 --> 0:47:51.666
I have a carpet shop in the Aleppo market.
I would like to host you there.

0:47:52.066 --> 0:47:53.666
If we have time, we may visit.

0:47:54.000 --> 0:47:57.466
Please be aware, son.
The crusaders may attack any moment.

0:47:59.400 --> 0:48:03.933
-They will not be seen around here today.
-You should still be careful.

0:48:05.200 --> 0:48:08.100
They can masquerade and pose as anything.

0:48:11.066 --> 0:48:12.366
Thank you.

0:48:33.300 --> 0:48:37.066
-How are you, Turgut?
-I am better. Much better.

0:48:38.333 --> 0:48:40.166
I regained consciousness.

0:48:42.033 --> 0:48:43.366
Where are we?

0:48:43.700 --> 0:48:47.033
When we had the chance,
why didn’t we slain them here?

0:48:47.633 --> 0:48:50.900
We have warriors who killed
15 soldiers of ours.

0:48:52.966 --> 0:48:55.333
God accepted my prayers in the end.

0:48:56.066 --> 0:48:58.000
He made me meet my enemy.

0:49:00.166 --> 0:49:03.400
We will prepare a nice welcome ceremony
for them in Aleppo.

0:49:08.700 --> 0:49:12.966
Hear ye, hear ye,
please let it be known...

0:49:13.333 --> 0:49:16.533
...the caravan will set on the road
in two days!

0:49:18.000 --> 0:49:20.166
Orders from Suleyman Shah!

0:49:22.100 --> 0:49:26.566
Dear Akcakoca, do you know what
I thought when this crier shouted caravan?

0:49:27.333 --> 0:49:31.133
If you had listened to what I said,
your caravan would be...

0:49:31.200 --> 0:49:34.333
...from here to China.
-Don’t start again, Wild Demir, don’t.

0:49:34.533 --> 0:49:38.466
Look, Akcakoca, you don’t need to
get upset. All I said was that...

0:49:38.666 --> 0:49:44.200
...instead of dealing with these ointments
for wounds, pains, poisons and such...

0:49:44.466 --> 0:49:49.366
...you should have done an ointment for
women, put them in fancy bottles...

0:49:49.566 --> 0:49:54.200
...with bright colors, women would smear
them on their faces and when they...

0:49:54.366 --> 0:49:58.033
...found themselves beautiful,
you would have been bathing in coins.

0:49:58.166 --> 0:50:00.666
Go back to your work! Dear God!

0:50:03.166 --> 0:50:07.500
What is happening, my girl? The cows
cannot make dung fast enough for you.

0:50:07.966 --> 0:50:11.366
For the love of God, father!
We are all stressed out as it is.

0:50:13.266 --> 0:50:16.466
I understand, no one likes to joke around.

0:50:23.433 --> 0:50:24.600
Alright?

0:50:44.566 --> 0:50:45.933
Put a bit more.

0:50:50.166 --> 0:50:52.066
Is this much dung enough, Halime?

0:50:52.200 --> 0:50:54.600
Yes, I hope it is enough.

0:50:56.166 --> 0:51:01.033
Everyone is very tense. They say no good
will come out of drapes bathed in dung.

0:51:01.200 --> 0:51:04.100
They think all their efforts
will go down in vain.

0:51:04.433 --> 0:51:09.333
Look, Aykiz. Why do you think the drapes
they brought to Mother Hayme were faded?

0:51:10.400 --> 0:51:12.366
Because the drapes were gray.

0:51:13.000 --> 0:51:16.666
First of all, we need to whiten
the drapes we will dye later.

0:51:17.566 --> 0:51:22.033
These pieces of dung will make
our drapes as white as snow.

0:51:22.466 --> 0:51:24.966
Then you can dye any pattern you like.

0:51:25.100 --> 0:51:27.633
Believe me, Aykiz, they will be very nice.

0:51:28.033 --> 0:51:30.066
As long as it solves the problem.

0:51:31.500 --> 0:51:36.266
But if we mess up, we will be in trouble.
We will be the talk of the tribe.

0:51:41.666 --> 0:51:45.100
This one is done, Aykiz.
Dry them in the sun for some time.

0:51:46.066 --> 0:51:47.466
May it be easy, Hatuns.

0:51:50.066 --> 0:51:52.933
What is happening?
What are you working on?

0:51:53.233 --> 0:51:55.233
We bathe the drapes in dung.

0:51:57.100 --> 0:52:01.666
You bathe the drapes in dung?
I was not expecting this.

0:52:03.033 --> 0:52:05.000
Where did this come from, Aykiz?

0:52:05.233 --> 0:52:08.000
Halime Baci got permission
from Mother Hayme.

0:52:08.400 --> 0:52:13.933
What punishment is this? The drapes were
the only place where dirt was not smeared.

0:52:24.333 --> 0:52:28.433
What are you doing, Gokce? She invaded the
weavery as well, why didn’t you stop her?

0:52:28.600 --> 0:52:32.566
What could I do, sister? Do I have a say
after Mother Hayme accepted?

0:52:37.200 --> 0:52:42.666
Don’t you worry about it. When they mess
up this job, they will pay its price.

0:52:44.300 --> 0:52:47.233
Why would an outsider whore pay the price?

0:52:47.600 --> 0:52:52.600
If these goods don’t make it
to the caravan in time, we pay the price.

0:52:54.200 --> 0:52:56.933
Sister, why are you making
a big deal out of her?

0:52:57.100 --> 0:53:00.400
As you overrate this girl,
she starts to get more confident.

0:53:01.133 --> 0:53:04.066
Do you know why I am making
a big deal out of her, Gokce?

0:53:04.266 --> 0:53:07.300
Because I have a very naive sister,
that is why.

0:53:07.900 --> 0:53:11.600
The man my sister loves,
is tangled in her web.

0:53:12.200 --> 0:53:16.200
My sister may not see, but I do.
My sister may not hear, but I do.

0:53:17.200 --> 0:53:20.033
The way Ertugrul looks
at this girl is not normal.

0:53:20.200 --> 0:53:23.566
Remember my words when
you start crying after him.

0:54:43.033 --> 0:54:46.200
<i>I have one rose in three branches</i>

0:54:47.333 --> 0:54:52.200
<i>I have sweet made of milk, my dervish</i>

0:54:53.000 --> 0:54:56.933
<i>Help me, Abdul Qadir</i>

0:54:58.166 --> 0:55:04.333
<i>I have a problem</i>

0:55:08.566 --> 0:55:09.900
Master.

0:55:16.200 --> 0:55:20.600
I can smell your grandfather,
our Master Gilani on you, Halabi.

0:55:20.966 --> 0:55:23.166
Thank you. Welcome, master.

0:55:24.166 --> 0:55:26.666
We came from a long way with our guests.

0:55:28.333 --> 0:55:31.466
Suleyman Shah’s son Ertugrul
from Kayi tribe.

0:55:31.966 --> 0:55:34.533
They have a mission,
they will go to the palace.

0:55:34.666 --> 0:55:38.233
Then they are in luck, master.
Today is the visiting day of the palace.

0:55:38.433 --> 0:55:42.633
If they can see the Emir, today is the day
otherwise they have to wait one month.

0:55:43.000 --> 0:55:45.233
The One Who Blesses, son.

0:55:50.700 --> 0:55:56.266
Dear God, I never thought that I would use
dung to bleach the cloths one day, Halime.

0:55:57.133 --> 0:56:01.300
You should see them after they get
snowy white. It will be worth the effort.

0:56:03.133 --> 0:56:06.300
Then we will see the faces of those
who talk from our backs.

0:56:10.333 --> 0:56:11.400
Well?

0:56:11.566 --> 0:56:14.200
We can also bath your dowry drapes
in dung as well.

0:56:14.366 --> 0:56:18.433
Of course we can.
As long as they return safe and sound.

0:56:19.400 --> 0:56:22.066
-Is your dowry ready?
-Of course it is.

0:56:22.366 --> 0:56:25.500
They have been laying inside
the chest for a long time.

0:56:25.666 --> 0:56:28.400
Turgut Alp couldn’t get down
from his horse yet.

0:56:28.700 --> 0:56:30.900
Why Turgut Alp, why?

0:56:32.333 --> 0:56:35.933
Yes, Aykiz, it is not easy to be
the wife of an Alp.

0:56:36.366 --> 0:56:39.100
I have been waiting for
Ertugrul Bey for years.

0:56:50.333 --> 0:56:53.466
If it weren’t for the trader’s man
and Wild  Demir...

0:56:54.000 --> 0:56:56.466
...my reputation would have been ruined.

0:56:59.900 --> 0:57:03.266
Do you think Karatoygar
will continue with these violations?

0:57:03.966 --> 0:57:07.600
We now know Numan’s worth
in the eye of Karatoygar.

0:57:07.933 --> 0:57:10.133
He is more precious than we thought.

0:57:11.200 --> 0:57:13.900
Karatoygar would do anything
to get him back.

0:57:14.133 --> 0:57:15.433
What will you do?

0:57:15.600 --> 0:57:20.066
Until Ertugrul comes with good news,
we will stay here and be ready for war.

0:57:23.666 --> 0:57:26.533
You know the guest’s daughter, Halime?

0:57:27.700 --> 0:57:32.033
You should see her. She works endlessly
to make the dye brighter on the drapes.

0:57:32.200 --> 0:57:35.600
Do you think she would succeed?
They make the best money in the market.

0:57:35.933 --> 0:57:38.266
If God permits, Bey, if God permits.

0:57:41.000 --> 0:57:46.100
If God permits, we will migrate to Aleppo,
we can think Ertugrul’s wedding and...

0:57:47.366 --> 0:57:53.600
Anyhow, may God let him return from Aleppo
with good news first, then we will see.

0:57:54.300 --> 0:57:55.600
Who do you have in mind?

0:57:56.300 --> 0:57:57.433
Gokce.

0:57:58.433 --> 0:58:01.900
I am surprised that you find her suitable
while knowing her sister.

0:58:02.166 --> 0:58:04.500
Gokce is different. She is a good girl.

0:58:06.433 --> 0:58:13.100
Maybe this way, she can control
her sister’s endless ambitions.

0:58:15.666 --> 0:58:18.933
You would not talk like this
if Gokce did not want to wed.

0:58:19.166 --> 0:58:22.566
Well? What about Ertugrul?
Does he have the heart?

0:58:23.566 --> 0:58:26.100
If God permits, we will see about that.

0:58:34.333 --> 0:58:36.666
Sister, you made a fool out of me! A fool!

0:58:38.300 --> 0:58:39.966
What are you saying, Gokce?

0:58:40.133 --> 0:58:44.166
Because of you, I faced off with Halime
and told her that I waited for Ertugrul.

0:58:46.133 --> 0:58:49.133
What more do you want?
You were too late to act anyway.

0:58:51.333 --> 0:58:55.633
Sister, I guess you didn’t understand.
I said everyone heard me. Aykiz as well.

0:58:57.266 --> 0:59:01.366
Now everyone will tease me. They will say
that I am dreaming standing up.

0:59:01.633 --> 0:59:03.533
-This is your fault.
-Gokce!

0:59:05.200 --> 0:59:09.400
Look at me. Do not care
even if the whole world hears it.

0:59:09.966 --> 0:59:14.166
You will win over Ertugrul
just like I did with Gundogdu.

0:59:14.666 --> 0:59:18.066
And you will fight with
nails, teeth and all.

0:59:18.400 --> 0:59:23.033
With your sweet talk and your beauty,
you will win over that son of a bastard.

0:59:23.700 --> 0:59:26.400
You will crush anyone on your path.

0:59:26.933 --> 0:59:31.600
Just like I became Gundogdu’s wife,
you will become Ertugrul’s wife.

0:59:33.366 --> 0:59:36.366
We have not settled the score with
Suleyman Shah yet.

0:59:36.500 --> 0:59:40.566
Each day the killer of our father sits
in the marquee, is a shame on us...

0:59:40.700 --> 0:59:44.200
...a wound in our heart.
I don’t have any blood left in my veins.

0:59:44.366 --> 0:59:48.600
Do you understand? Sitting in the marquee
is our well deserved right and...

0:59:48.933 --> 0:59:50.433
...we will get our right.

1:01:12.300 --> 1:01:13.566
What is it you want?

1:01:18.166 --> 1:01:20.200
Did you swallow your tongue, talk!

1:01:21.266 --> 1:01:24.066
A man’s word is said directly
to a man’s face, Bey.

1:01:35.066 --> 1:01:36.166
Alright.

1:01:39.966 --> 1:01:42.700
My eyes and ears are with you. Talk now.

1:01:43.333 --> 1:01:46.333
I came as an ambassador of
Suleyman Shah of Kayi tribe.

1:01:46.500 --> 1:01:48.533
I am his son, my name is Ertugrul.

1:01:50.966 --> 1:01:52.066
Well?

1:01:53.166 --> 1:01:55.100
What do you want, son of a Bey?

1:01:55.266 --> 1:01:57.233
I came to claim land from you.

1:01:59.333 --> 1:02:00.533
You want land?

1:02:04.066 --> 1:02:06.200
What will you give us in exchange?

1:02:06.933 --> 1:02:11.666
Apart from the goats that will damage
our crops and the stench over our city?

1:02:13.666 --> 1:02:16.266
Did the city make you forget
your roots, Bey?

1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:21.900
How did you know that
I was Turkmen as well?

1:02:22.466 --> 1:02:26.933
The ring on your thumb. It is obvious
that it is not a mere ornament.

1:02:27.300 --> 1:02:31.366
It gives you away, your thumb is damaged
due to shooting arrows to infidels.

1:02:31.933 --> 1:02:36.233
If you give us a land, in exchange
2000 Alps will be on your side...

1:02:36.433 --> 1:02:40.033
...anytime you have trouble.
-2000 Alps?

1:02:41.900 --> 1:02:44.933
Even the guards in my palace
is more than this.

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.933
May you have a good journey, son of a Bey.
Next.

1:02:56.466 --> 1:02:58.366
-Bey.
-Next.

1:02:59.066 --> 1:03:00.200
Bey.

1:03:00.666 --> 1:03:01.933
Come on.

1:03:02.900 --> 1:03:04.100
Come on.

1:03:20.233 --> 1:03:22.900
Your guards, count them as three less.

1:03:32.066 --> 1:03:36.666
Congratulations.
It was the best spectacle I have watched.

1:03:37.300 --> 1:03:39.633
Isn’t that so, Nasir? You clap as well.

1:03:43.566 --> 1:03:44.966
Your highness Ameer.

1:03:48.333 --> 1:03:51.466
I would like to get to know
this Turkmen warrior better.

1:03:52.566 --> 1:03:57.366
We shall listen to the myths, stories
and sagas of the nomads from him...

1:03:57.566 --> 1:04:01.300
...during dinner tonight, what do you say,
my dear uncle?

1:04:02.233 --> 1:04:04.166
I would be honored, your highness.

1:04:19.133 --> 1:04:21.200
He sent the bodies of my men.

1:04:22.500 --> 1:04:24.466
He thinks he can intimidate me.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.533
Pray that he did not run over
your soldiers.

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:31.900
What are you saying?
Is your Bey opposing the Seljuk state?

1:04:32.233 --> 1:04:34.500
Stop speaking nonsense, Karatoygar.

1:04:35.366 --> 1:04:38.033
And don’t try to use Seljuk state
as an excuse.

1:04:38.666 --> 1:04:42.033
Sultan Aladdin is not aware
of the things you do here.

1:04:42.966 --> 1:04:44.500
I am sure of that.

1:04:45.133 --> 1:04:49.333
I understand that these prisoners will
open other doors for you in the state.

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.700
You should focus your intelligence
on your own tasks.

1:04:54.400 --> 1:04:58.400
What does this intelligence say
about your incompetence, Kurdoglu?

1:04:58.700 --> 1:05:01.700
You should see the incompetence of
your own men first.

1:05:02.066 --> 1:05:04.033
They cannot even throw an ambush.

1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:08.166
That is enough, Kurdoglu.
If you don’t bring Numan to me...

1:05:08.466 --> 1:05:12.933
...you cannot become the Bey you wish.
I would make the sky fall on you.

1:05:13.633 --> 1:05:17.466
You and Suleyman Shah
would be crushed below it.

1:05:18.366 --> 1:05:21.966
If you can be patient,
we can both take what we want.

1:05:22.466 --> 1:05:26.666
But if you trample over me,
we would both lose.

1:05:27.900 --> 1:05:32.233
I am prepared to fight
the whole world for Numan.

1:05:33.133 --> 1:05:35.633
Don’t you ever forget this.

1:05:37.433 --> 1:05:40.200
Won’t you still tell me
who those prisoners are?

1:05:40.433 --> 1:05:43.466
Don’t think about who they are,
think about who I am.

1:05:44.333 --> 1:05:46.933
This is more important for you, Kurdoglu.

1:05:48.933 --> 1:05:50.333
What will we do now?

1:05:55.333 --> 1:05:59.666
I will give you Numan and
Suleyman Shah as well.

1:06:01.200 --> 1:06:04.200
You will come to collect them
like a ripe date on a branch.

1:06:08.966 --> 1:06:10.466
Now, listen to me closely.

1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:16.033
When the caravan is ambushed,
Suleyman Shah cannot sit in his tent.

1:06:16.200 --> 1:06:17.700
He will come after you.

1:06:18.066 --> 1:06:19.333
14 carpets.

1:06:20.700 --> 1:06:22.966
Two dozens of wooden spoon.

1:06:24.333 --> 1:06:26.233
72 pieces of kerchief.

1:06:26.700 --> 1:06:30.566
God bless. God bless.
Your daughter and bride worked very well.

1:06:31.666 --> 1:06:36.133
Dear Teyze, you should tie them well so
that we don’t have a problem on the road.

1:06:36.266 --> 1:06:39.666
We wrapped them all up, Bey.
We wrapped them very well with my husband.

1:06:40.633 --> 1:06:43.600
We don’t have a lot but I beg you...

1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:47.533
...protect the caravan well.
Our livestock died of starvation.

1:06:47.900 --> 1:06:49.900
All we have is entrusted in you.

1:06:50.233 --> 1:06:55.100
I know, Emmi, I know. Don’t you worry.
Trust God first, then us with your goods.

1:06:55.433 --> 1:06:59.066
I chose the best Alps I have for this job.
Do not worry about it.

1:06:59.233 --> 1:07:01.000
Do not worry, people!

1:07:01.433 --> 1:07:03.233
-Alright?
-Yes, Bey. Alright.

1:07:04.266 --> 1:07:05.466
Gundogdu...

1:07:07.033 --> 1:07:11.200
...with the money I get from these knives,
I will wed my daughter, let it be known.

1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:14.266
You cannot save yourself
from Aykiz’s wrath.

1:07:14.700 --> 1:07:16.200
Turgut’s as well.

1:07:17.533 --> 1:07:22.500
We don’t know the distress they are
in Aleppo, may God be with them.

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:25.066
With you too.

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.133
Next.

1:07:36.333 --> 1:07:39.433
Don’t come closer.
I would crush you like a millstone.

1:07:39.966 --> 1:07:41.333
Please don't do this!

1:07:42.200 --> 1:07:45.333
Anytime water touches my skin,
trouble finds me.

1:07:45.933 --> 1:07:50.433
-You would go down with me as well.
-Bamsi, there is a feast in the palace.

1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:53.366
Decide whether you will eat with us
or in the stable.

1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:56.400
Please don’t.
I won’t give you my blessing if you die.

1:07:56.666 --> 1:07:59.600
Bamsi, you have no way out.
You have to bathe. Give in.

1:07:59.900 --> 1:08:03.333
I will not! I will die but
not submit to this. I will not!

1:08:03.566 --> 1:08:06.366
-You skunk! You asked for this!
-Dear God!

1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:14.533
-Please don’t do this. Dear God!
-Quiet!

1:08:20.666 --> 1:08:23.533
Do not play around.
We will be late to the palace.

1:08:27.633 --> 1:08:31.600
You heard our Bey, do not play around.

1:08:43.433 --> 1:08:46.666
Bey? Why are you so thoughtful?

1:08:48.166 --> 1:08:51.133
Being invited to
Ameer’s palace is a big thing for us.

1:08:54.233 --> 1:08:58.000
They did not give us a land
or a promise, Ilyas.

1:08:59.566 --> 1:09:02.466
-We will see what God has planned for us.
-Amen, Bey.

1:09:14.300 --> 1:09:16.366
This job shall be finished tonight.

1:09:17.333 --> 1:09:20.066
Will the men you send
be able to finish the job?

1:09:21.066 --> 1:09:23.100
You do your part, Nasir.

1:09:36.166 --> 1:09:38.066
Which one of you hid my weapons?

1:09:38.333 --> 1:09:40.700
What are you saying?
Didn’t we go inside together?

1:09:41.033 --> 1:09:43.500
-But they are not here, look.
-What do you mean?

1:09:48.333 --> 1:09:51.433
-Mine are not here either.
-They stole mine as well.

1:09:52.966 --> 1:09:57.333
I told you! Anytime I bathe,
some trouble happens! You saw it as well!

1:09:57.533 --> 1:10:00.033
We were careless trying to bathe you!

1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:04.366
That’s enough! Shut up!
How will we tell this to our Bey?

1:10:07.133 --> 1:10:09.000
What will you tell me, Turgut?

1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:20.633
-I am asking you, Turgut.
-Bey, they stole our weapons.

1:10:22.433 --> 1:10:23.566
What?

1:11:39.366 --> 1:11:40.700
Please, sit.

1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:54.600
Please come to the table, Alps.

1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.966
-Did you lose a man in the fight?
-No, your highness.

1:12:40.166 --> 1:12:44.366
So, you were ambushed in my territory.
Is that so?

1:12:47.266 --> 1:12:50.633
We will send soldiers and not let them
nest there, right, uncle?

1:12:51.066 --> 1:12:54.466
-Of course, your highness.
-Fine. Alright.

1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:59.333
They were punished severe enough.
They are all dead.

1:13:09.433 --> 1:13:13.233
I know how the famine is affecting
you nomads. Sultan Aladdin is being...

1:13:13.400 --> 1:13:18.466
...over tolerant with you. It is known
how your herds destroy villages and towns.

1:13:20.266 --> 1:13:23.933
The struggle between
the Oguz Tribes is another problem.

1:13:24.933 --> 1:13:27.633
Everyone is after their herd, after food.

1:13:28.433 --> 1:13:33.400
Famine hit the tribes hard. But a few
vigilant people cannot be an example.

1:13:36.700 --> 1:13:40.533
I am bored. Play something more lively.

1:13:46.133 --> 1:13:49.333
Mongols from one side,
crusaders on the other.

1:13:49.633 --> 1:13:52.633
I am not even counting
Khwarazmshahs and the Seljuks.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:57.400
We need an ally to run to this fire with
a bucket of water, not a bellow.

1:13:59.566 --> 1:14:03.266
When the factions inside the Muslim world
is demolishing everything...

1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:07.000
...this is what we need.
Is this not so, your highness?

1:14:09.933 --> 1:14:13.200
It is, uncle. We need to put out the fire.

1:14:17.333 --> 1:14:21.433
Our swords would not go back to their
sheaths, our horses don’t back down.

1:14:21.700 --> 1:14:25.966
We also need an ally with a bucket of
water to put out the fire in our home.

1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:29.200
How will we make a deal with you, Turkmen?

1:14:33.066 --> 1:14:36.033
We would like a fertile winter quarter
for our tribe.

1:14:36.466 --> 1:14:37.966
A quarter.

1:14:38.666 --> 1:14:42.333
First you ask a quarter.
Then that would turn into a moorland.

1:14:42.533 --> 1:14:45.066
Then you would demand a whole territory.

1:14:45.233 --> 1:14:47.533
True, we would.

1:14:53.133 --> 1:14:55.000
If I gave you Aleppo...

1:15:00.633 --> 1:15:02.333
...would you be satisfied?

1:15:05.233 --> 1:15:09.000
Instead of offending an Ameer
who opened his land for us...

1:15:09.166 --> 1:15:12.100
...we would let all the herds
we have starve.

1:15:15.966 --> 1:15:19.666
-But I have reservations, Ertugrul.
-I am here to clear them up.

1:15:23.966 --> 1:15:27.200
We thank you for the presents
Kayi ambassadors brought for us.

1:15:27.366 --> 1:15:30.200
If you accept,
we also have some presents for you.

1:16:19.466 --> 1:16:20.966
These are our weapons.

1:16:44.966 --> 1:16:50.033
Now tell me, Ertugrul. How can we trust
the promises of warriors who cannot...

1:16:50.266 --> 1:16:53.033
...even hold on to their weapons
during peace?

1:17:32.300 --> 1:17:36.366
Why are you there, Nasir?
We are having fun here, come beside me.

1:17:54.133 --> 1:17:58.100
Now you can go. Go and rest.
You came from a long way.

1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:02.466
I will consult with my commanders
tomorrow and give you my decision.

1:19:11.666 --> 1:19:16.233
I herewith swear that from now on,
a hand that cannot claim his sword...

1:19:18.433 --> 1:19:20.400
...shall not hold any other weapon.

1:19:23.466 --> 1:19:26.433
I wish our weapons had been
struck by lightning...

1:19:26.566 --> 1:19:29.900
...so that our Ertugrul Bey
would not have been humiliated like this.

1:19:30.300 --> 1:19:34.433
I wonder what Ertugrul Bey feels
right now. He must be in rage.

1:19:46.900 --> 1:19:48.166
Peace be upon you.

1:19:48.433 --> 1:19:54.100
And peace be upon you,
with God’s Grace and Mercy.

1:20:16.566 --> 1:20:21.666
With peace in our world and beyond,
we commemorate one of your followers...

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.666
...who was full of love,
his highness Abdul Qadir Gilani.

1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:43.266
Great God...

1:21:43.966 --> 1:21:46.900
...You never make a subject
carry a load too heavy for him.

1:21:47.066 --> 1:21:49.533
You put the load of the whole tribe
on my shoulders.

1:21:49.900 --> 1:21:52.033
Grant me a way to carry this load.

1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.700
You took Jonah out from a hole and made
him Sultan of Egypt. Please grant me...

1:22:08.033 --> 1:22:11.600
...an opportunity so that I can climb up
from this bottomless pit I have fallen.

1:25:22.233 --> 1:25:23.666
<i>Wake up, my son.</i>

1:26:23.316 --> 1:26:25.950
Dear God, we thank you.

1:26:36.683 --> 1:26:38.716
What did you do, did you kill him?

1:26:42.216 --> 1:26:43.350
Don’t kill him!

1:26:53.316 --> 1:26:55.783
-Why did you kill him?
-What is happening here?

1:27:07.650 --> 1:27:09.983
We learned many things from you,
your highness.

1:27:10.116 --> 1:27:14.383
In your cities, we have to guard
our weapons and our lives as well.

1:27:15.883 --> 1:27:17.416
Who is this man, Nasir?

1:27:29.116 --> 1:27:30.316
A Templar.

1:28:08.950 --> 1:28:11.083
What did you talk about during dinner?

1:28:11.250 --> 1:28:13.116
What does he want from El Aziz?

1:28:13.250 --> 1:28:15.816
Kayis.
They wanted a quarter to stay in winter.

1:28:18.783 --> 1:28:20.383
Kayis must get what they want.

1:28:22.383 --> 1:28:24.716
What do you mean? I don’t understand.

1:28:25.150 --> 1:28:29.350
The territory they get, make it near
the border with the Crusader Countship.

1:28:29.750 --> 1:28:33.783
This is an opportunity to kill
not only Ertugrul but all their blood.

1:28:35.050 --> 1:28:38.683
Kayis may spend the winter in the skirts
of the Amanos Mountains...

1:28:38.883 --> 1:28:42.450
...somewhere very remote,
near the border of Antioch Countship.

1:28:45.150 --> 1:28:47.750
This will be the last winter
of their lives.

1:28:48.850 --> 1:28:51.450
Titus, are you aware of
what you are saying?

1:28:52.683 --> 1:28:54.116
This is a dangerous game.

1:28:54.283 --> 1:28:56.050
Do as I tell you, Nasir.

1:29:08.650 --> 1:29:10.016
Follow them everywhere.

1:29:10.283 --> 1:29:14.016
You will report every move he makes,
every breath he takes back to me.

1:29:14.316 --> 1:29:15.816
Take these pigeons.

1:29:31.883 --> 1:29:35.916
You became the hero of the tribe all of
a sudden, you don’t even talk to me now.

1:29:36.250 --> 1:29:39.216
Suleyman Shah is not giving
his goods for us to sell.

1:29:40.283 --> 1:29:44.350
We came to the tribe for nothing.
Come on, help me prepare the caravan.

1:29:44.750 --> 1:29:47.916
-I am not coming.
-I will not have this attitude, Afsin.

1:29:48.183 --> 1:29:50.716
I took you with me while
you were starving.

1:29:50.983 --> 1:29:53.416
I gave you food and water, made you a man!

1:29:53.750 --> 1:29:56.150
Now you cannot turn against me.
You owe me.

1:29:59.050 --> 1:30:01.916
-May you heal soon.
-Thank you, Bey.

1:30:09.116 --> 1:30:11.883
It is not very common...

1:30:13.750 --> 1:30:17.683
...for someone to be such a good trader
and swordsman at the same time.

1:30:17.850 --> 1:30:20.950
I heard that last night you fought well
in this wounded state.

1:30:21.083 --> 1:30:23.683
The helper of the trader is
also just like you.

1:30:23.816 --> 1:30:28.216
If I were a good trader, I would not have
been left out with children and no money.

1:30:28.883 --> 1:30:33.216
When we come to sword, what we know about
swordsmanship is playing with children...

1:30:33.350 --> 1:30:37.783
...that is all. If God permits, the burden
we imposed on you should finish soon.

1:30:39.283 --> 1:30:42.416
This is our only consolation,
Numan Effendi.

1:30:43.316 --> 1:30:45.150
Our only consolation.

1:30:46.116 --> 1:30:47.883
So you say I owe you.

1:30:48.983 --> 1:30:53.716
Look at me, you dirty old man!
I worked for you like a dog for years...

1:30:53.850 --> 1:30:58.916
...and I paid my debt to you! Now get out
of my face before I rip your head off.

1:30:59.316 --> 1:31:00.650
Get lost!

1:31:17.850 --> 1:31:19.250
One is a trader...

1:31:21.216 --> 1:31:23.716
...the other one is a caravan worker.

1:31:27.850 --> 1:31:30.350
But they are first class swordsmen.

1:31:33.816 --> 1:31:35.716
You found each other well.

1:31:40.316 --> 1:31:46.083
I don’t know why but I don’t wonder about
who Karatoygar’s man inside the tribe is.

1:32:22.450 --> 1:32:23.950
What are you doing?

1:32:27.950 --> 1:32:29.916
-Selcan.
-Stop! Don’t!

1:32:30.283 --> 1:32:34.050
This is a sin! You cannot precede over
what God permits for you!

1:32:36.250 --> 1:32:39.216
If we had a baby,
everything would be different.

1:32:40.950 --> 1:32:42.183
My Hatun.

1:32:44.783 --> 1:32:48.783
We will have a baby one day.
We should not lose hope from God.

1:32:51.316 --> 1:32:52.716
Your mother...

1:33:00.116 --> 1:33:03.216
...is about to crown Halime
the first chance she gets.

1:33:03.716 --> 1:33:04.950
Selcan...

1:33:05.183 --> 1:33:06.683
...don’t talk anymore!

1:33:10.316 --> 1:33:13.250
You are not aware of
the things going on around you.

1:33:14.216 --> 1:33:17.683
You don’t know the respect
she showed her at the weaving area.

1:33:17.883 --> 1:33:20.650
She shows her the respect
she refrains from me.

1:33:20.916 --> 1:33:25.116
She treats me as if I am not
his son’s wife but a mere servant.

1:33:25.950 --> 1:33:28.983
Why?
Because I did not give her a grandson yet.

1:33:29.283 --> 1:33:30.716
She hates me.

1:33:31.650 --> 1:33:34.683
Selcan.
You are accusing my mother without reason.

1:33:35.016 --> 1:33:36.850
She would not stoop so low.

1:33:37.016 --> 1:33:39.383
I know what goes through her mind.

1:33:42.216 --> 1:33:46.083
Look, woman, I cannot listen to
your whining right before the caravan...

1:33:46.216 --> 1:33:49.316
...alright? For the love of God.
-You don’t understand, do you?

1:33:49.683 --> 1:33:53.916
I am saying that Halime will set her foot
in our tribe but you don’t care less.

1:33:54.216 --> 1:33:56.450
God give me patience, patience.

1:34:37.783 --> 1:34:40.650
Gundogdu came out of his rage
very quickly, thank God.

1:34:42.150 --> 1:34:44.116
He deserved to lead the caravan.

1:34:44.983 --> 1:34:47.216
Just like he deserved to carry wood.

1:34:49.916 --> 1:34:53.083
If God permits, he will manage
to beat his arrogance as well.

1:34:53.716 --> 1:34:56.450
If God permits, Hayme. If God permits.

1:34:58.050 --> 1:35:01.816
He organized the caravan very quickly.
That is not easy at all.

1:35:02.216 --> 1:35:05.183
He works day and night,
fighting tooth and nail.

1:35:06.216 --> 1:35:07.983
May God let him succeed.

1:35:11.250 --> 1:35:13.650
-Sometimes...
-Sometimes what?

1:35:16.950 --> 1:35:20.983
-Nothing.
-Hayme, what is on your mind?

1:35:23.116 --> 1:35:26.883
I don’t know, Bey.
I get anxious about many things.

1:35:27.950 --> 1:35:31.683
Don’t you worry.
They will both return safe and sound.

1:35:35.416 --> 1:35:37.450
If God permits. If God permits.

1:35:41.383 --> 1:35:43.816
Halime, come on,
let us go and eat something.

1:35:44.050 --> 1:35:47.716
-Aykiz, I will come after I finish this.
-Alright, I will be waiting.

1:36:29.183 --> 1:36:32.383
-Sister, what did you do?
-This is not the time to question me.

1:36:32.716 --> 1:36:36.916
-What did you throw inside the cauldron?
-I am trying to save you from that girl.

1:36:37.883 --> 1:36:39.916
Sister, what you did is not right.

1:36:40.083 --> 1:36:43.283
Moreover, the problem is not Halime here,
it is the caravan.

1:36:43.383 --> 1:36:47.850
Gokce, why are you so empty headed?
Haven’t you still grasped the problem?

1:36:47.983 --> 1:36:50.883
That girl is the biggest disaster
who came to our tribe.

1:36:51.050 --> 1:36:54.016
When will you understand this?
When Ertugrul weds her?

1:37:29.350 --> 1:37:31.016
Do we have permission, Bey?

1:37:41.883 --> 1:37:47.016
Bey, we put you in a difficult situation.
We want you to forgive us.

1:37:59.383 --> 1:38:03.016
If you make a mistake like this again,
you would not find the opportunity...

1:38:03.183 --> 1:38:05.350
...to come before me
and ask for forgiveness.

1:38:11.883 --> 1:38:14.883
Bey, his highness Ameer
would like to see you.

1:38:53.150 --> 1:38:55.316
Come, brave boy of the steppes, come.

1:38:58.783 --> 1:39:01.916
I owe you an apology for
the things that happened last night.

1:39:02.116 --> 1:39:06.716
Whoever is behind this attempt, my uncle
will find and punish them accordingly.

1:39:07.983 --> 1:39:10.316
-Uncle.
-We decided to...

1:39:10.883 --> 1:39:14.350
...give you the territory you requested,
son of a Bey.

1:39:16.116 --> 1:39:19.283
If you want the truth,
Nasir persuaded us to do so.

1:39:23.350 --> 1:39:26.283
Do you know this place?
West of the Asi River.

1:39:27.916 --> 1:39:31.716
-I heard that the land was fertile.
-It is fertile in enemies as well.

1:39:31.883 --> 1:39:35.016
It is at the border of the people
who came to kill you last night.

1:39:35.150 --> 1:39:37.916
So we can sleep side by side
with the devil.

1:39:38.083 --> 1:39:40.750
Is it worth to take this risk
for your herds?

1:39:41.183 --> 1:39:44.983
Enemy enables us to be alert
and spry all the time. It keeps us alive.

1:39:49.183 --> 1:39:54.416
Awesome, awesome, awesome. I love
these braves from the steppes, uncle.

1:39:55.216 --> 1:40:00.083
So you want to test your fate in the face
of the scorpion needle. Is that so?

1:40:01.416 --> 1:40:05.183
If you are so willing to sleep
side by side with the devil...

1:40:05.716 --> 1:40:08.183
...all we can say is good luck to you.

1:40:08.950 --> 1:40:11.683
We are impressed by
your courage once again.

1:40:14.050 --> 1:40:16.850
When we have friends like you behind us...

1:40:17.749 --> 1:40:20.816
...we would never refrain from
facing the enemy upfront.

1:40:30.116 --> 1:40:33.249
Are you stilling thinking about
what Gokce said, Halime?

1:40:33.950 --> 1:40:36.750
No. Why would her words concern me?

1:40:37.816 --> 1:40:41.083
-It is between Ertugrul and Gokce.
-So you don’t care?

1:40:44.683 --> 1:40:48.983
I know that you are eating yourself inside
out the last two days, am I blind, Halime?

1:40:49.116 --> 1:40:52.883
-Aykiz, please, let us focus on our work.
-Alright but...

1:40:53.116 --> 1:40:58.383
...please don’t take that mad girl
Gokce seriously. She is in an illusion.

1:41:00.950 --> 1:41:02.916
Maybe Mother Hayme and Gokce already...

1:41:08.416 --> 1:41:09.750
Aykiz?

1:41:16.283 --> 1:41:20.116
For it to take this color,
pheasant’s eye seeds must be added.

1:41:22.083 --> 1:41:24.150
Halime, who would do this?

1:41:32.283 --> 1:41:35.116
Anyhow, there is a solution
for everything.

1:41:36.183 --> 1:41:39.083
Caravan is about to leave,
how will we make it in time?

1:41:39.316 --> 1:41:43.316
We will, Aykiz. There is no other way.
We will make it in time.

1:42:12.350 --> 1:42:13.450
We are leaving.

1:42:22.950 --> 1:42:25.383
Let us go and see our tribe’s
new territory.

1:42:25.883 --> 1:42:27.883
-Ertugrul Bey?
-So El Aziz...

1:42:29.083 --> 1:42:31.716
Let us not make our new land wait for us.

1:42:51.950 --> 1:42:57.916
I don’t want Gundogdu, my father in law
or Mother Hayme to know that I came here.

1:42:58.383 --> 1:43:01.016
Don’t worry. No one will know.

1:43:01.983 --> 1:43:05.716
Especially that man, Suleyman Shah,
will never know!

1:43:09.150 --> 1:43:12.450
As you asked,
I brought a wisp of Gundogdu’s hair.

1:43:15.016 --> 1:43:19.283
You are the daughter of a big Bey, Selcan.
You don’t deserve these things.

1:43:23.250 --> 1:43:27.350
The impudence of the woman who is supposed
to be your mother in law. Your husband...

1:43:27.683 --> 1:43:30.050
...looking at you like a dried up twig.
-Enough!

1:43:32.050 --> 1:43:36.350
Do not be ashamed of the pains you lived
through. You shall get all you deserve.

1:43:37.750 --> 1:43:41.283
The spirit army shall fill
your stomach with the seeds of your man.

1:43:47.216 --> 1:43:51.716
You will have a son.
And the fate of Kayi tribe will change.

1:43:59.383 --> 1:44:04.783
Hamza, we will leave early in the morning.
Check the weapons of the Alps...

1:44:04.916 --> 1:44:07.883
...make sure they have plenty of arrows.
-As you wish, Bey.

1:44:12.683 --> 1:44:14.783
-May it be easy.
-Thank you, uncle.

1:44:15.416 --> 1:44:17.183
I thought about it and...

1:44:17.350 --> 1:44:21.716
...I don’t think it is a good idea for you
to be going with the caravan, Gundogdu.

1:44:22.683 --> 1:44:23.816
Why is that?

1:44:23.983 --> 1:44:26.650
We don’t know what that Karatoygar dog
may be up to.

1:44:26.850 --> 1:44:29.950
Even if you take the best Alps with you,
this is very dangerous.

1:44:30.116 --> 1:44:33.950
You are son of a Bey. Ertugrul is not here
either and your father is ill.

1:44:34.716 --> 1:44:37.883
It would be best if you find
a way to stay in the tribe.

1:44:38.016 --> 1:44:41.983
Uncle, would it suit a son of a Bey
to drowse around in the tribe?

1:44:42.883 --> 1:44:47.416
Look around you. All these people have
trusted their goods and labor with me.

1:44:48.050 --> 1:44:50.683
Of course, it should be
my duty to take them.

1:44:50.850 --> 1:44:55.816
If that dog Karatoygar makes a move, we
shall do all what we can, if God permits.

1:44:57.016 --> 1:44:58.416
Do not worry about it.

1:45:04.883 --> 1:45:06.950
We made everything ready, Mother Hayme.

1:45:07.150 --> 1:45:08.916
Gokce finished the carpets.

1:45:09.116 --> 1:45:13.650
May your hands be blessed. If God permits,
they will find their worth in the market.

1:45:15.250 --> 1:45:17.416
And I wove this for you, Mother Hayme.

1:45:24.050 --> 1:45:28.783
My pure girl, clean girl.
You are one of a kind.

1:45:29.416 --> 1:45:32.316
When did you find the time
during all this hassle?

1:45:32.650 --> 1:45:34.983
She has not slept for days, Mother Hayme.

1:45:35.983 --> 1:45:37.683
God bless.

1:45:41.283 --> 1:45:42.983
Halime, what will we do?

1:46:11.350 --> 1:46:13.650
Why did they become like this, Halime?

1:46:22.183 --> 1:46:25.250
I am guessing that we did not use
enough dung, Mother Hayme.

1:46:25.650 --> 1:46:26.883
We shall try again.

1:46:30.850 --> 1:46:34.650
You did all you could do.
It would never be ready by the morning.

1:46:35.016 --> 1:46:39.450
No! We will work all night if needed to
make them ready, Mother Hayme.

1:46:40.083 --> 1:46:41.350
Do not worry.

1:46:44.750 --> 1:46:47.350
One last hope? Alright.

1:46:48.450 --> 1:46:50.116
May it be easy on you.

1:47:41.650 --> 1:47:43.050
Welcome, son of a Bey.

1:47:44.650 --> 1:47:48.050
I wanted a blessing from Ibn Arabi
before we set on the road.

1:47:49.050 --> 1:47:51.650
Sheikh Efendi already left,
don’t you know?

1:47:51.850 --> 1:47:54.450
-To where?
-God knows.

1:47:56.083 --> 1:47:58.750
-Won’t I see him again?
-Only God knows.

1:48:01.916 --> 1:48:05.283
-I need to find him.
-How can you find, if you have not lost?

1:48:05.783 --> 1:48:08.050
How can you lose, if you have not found?

1:48:20.950 --> 1:48:24.316
This was the stupidest thing
you could have done, Titus.

1:48:24.916 --> 1:48:30.716
You did not manage to revenge your brother
and made Kayis a bigger problem for us.

1:48:30.983 --> 1:48:33.416
Sir, I did the right thing.

1:48:34.350 --> 1:48:36.816
You did the right thing, is that so?

1:48:36.983 --> 1:48:40.683
-I did not expect such stupidity from you.
-Sir.

1:48:41.050 --> 1:48:45.883
I don’t understand whom you are afraid of.
Of Ertugrul or the person beside him...

1:48:46.050 --> 1:48:47.783
...Ibn Arabi?

1:48:49.316 --> 1:48:52.050
How dare you say that I am frightened?

1:48:55.083 --> 1:48:56.850
Listen to me closely, Titus.

1:48:57.350 --> 1:49:02.850
We will never let the Turks
come to our borders, never!

1:49:09.016 --> 1:49:14.316
If your desire for revenge precedes
your duty one more time...

1:49:15.383 --> 1:49:19.350
...I would bury you beside
your brother with my own hands.

1:49:40.150 --> 1:49:43.016
Great God, you make everything possible.

1:49:44.150 --> 1:49:45.783
This must be heaven.

1:49:46.116 --> 1:49:48.416
But hell is right around the corner.

1:49:48.883 --> 1:49:52.416
Yes, beyond this territory is the
Antioch Crusaders Countship.

1:49:53.416 --> 1:49:56.916
Secret fort of the Templars
must be somewhere around here.

1:49:58.116 --> 1:50:02.850
Devil is everywhere, Turgut.
In our tribe, in Aleppo. Everywhere.

1:50:04.150 --> 1:50:06.383
We will have a lot of fun, a lot!

1:51:12.283 --> 1:51:15.783
God bless, Bey. You can find water
under every stone you turn.

1:51:15.983 --> 1:51:18.316
I never saw such fertile land in my life.

1:51:18.883 --> 1:51:23.283
It will grow the babies, fatten the sheep.
It will give life to the tribe.

1:51:27.350 --> 1:51:31.250
How did they let such
a nice land to be uninhabited?

1:51:32.283 --> 1:51:34.783
Because it is right next to hell, Turgut.

1:51:36.116 --> 1:51:39.416
Yes, Bey.
Why did these Templars want to kill you?

1:51:40.783 --> 1:51:44.316
I am guessing that they want to
revenge the knights we killed.

1:51:44.650 --> 1:51:48.750
Bey, so we can say that they will not let
us find peace here as well.

1:51:50.383 --> 1:51:51.916
Forget the heretics...

1:51:55.183 --> 1:51:57.316
...think about your wedding with Aykiz.

1:51:58.150 --> 1:52:01.850
As soon as the tribe settles here,
our first job will be to wed you.

1:52:02.683 --> 1:52:03.916
God willing, Bey.

1:52:05.183 --> 1:52:10.883
Aykiz is a dear. If she was someone else,
she would have wed another man long ago.

1:52:17.716 --> 1:52:18.750
Bey...

1:52:20.450 --> 1:52:22.783
...maybe we can have a double wedding.

1:52:29.683 --> 1:52:34.683
Our flags shall be our tents. We shall
ride our horses to borderless plains.

1:52:35.650 --> 1:52:39.183
Our weapons shall be our lovers
and our armies shall be strong.

1:52:39.416 --> 1:52:43.983
Our crest shall fly over seven climates
as the flag of justice.

1:52:44.383 --> 1:52:48.316
We shall carry our divine message
beyond the mountains and seas.

1:53:30.650 --> 1:53:32.683
You came walking to your own death.

1:53:33.116 --> 1:53:36.016
You have been breathing down
on our necks since Aleppo.

1:53:36.183 --> 1:53:38.250
Tell me! Who holds your leash?

1:54:13.883 --> 1:54:15.716
He has already gone to hell.

1:54:37.316 --> 1:54:39.250
These are messenger pigeons, Bey.

1:54:42.350 --> 1:54:44.383
Then, let us send them to their owner.

1:56:40.216 --> 1:56:42.416
Dear God, thank you.

1:56:58.950 --> 1:57:00.750
The long awaited has come.

1:57:01.016 --> 1:57:03.416
What are you blabbering on again?

1:57:03.983 --> 1:57:08.850
Didn’t you come to me because of the
heaviness that fell upon you, Petroccio?

1:57:10.150 --> 1:57:15.683
I don’t believe in any of the prophecies
than heretic from Andalusia, Ibn Arabi...

1:57:15.883 --> 1:57:19.849
...has thrown our way,
my dear brother Giovanni.

1:57:21.250 --> 1:57:23.016
Don’t call me Giovanni.

1:57:25.050 --> 1:57:26.683
My name is Omer.

1:57:27.150 --> 1:57:32.683
You know very well that everything
my sheikh Ibn Arabi has said came true.

1:57:33.783 --> 1:57:36.950
The starbursts herald
the long awaited braves.

1:57:38.083 --> 1:57:43.016
Will these herd of shepherds running away
from the Mongols rule the whole world?

1:57:43.450 --> 1:57:47.250
They will unite the whole Muslim world
as a fist.

1:57:47.783 --> 1:57:53.250
And that fist will throw a punch,
demolishing your cursed order.

1:58:11.216 --> 1:58:13.283
Did you take enough water, Gundogdu?

1:58:14.016 --> 1:58:16.750
You won’t find water while passing
the Enger Mountain.

1:58:16.883 --> 1:58:20.916
We did, Bey. We didn’t want to take too
much as it would be heavy for the animals.

1:58:21.116 --> 1:58:25.450
-Good. Is there anything left behind?
-There is. Aykiz and Halime.

1:58:28.816 --> 1:58:30.350
Let me run and check them.

1:58:31.916 --> 1:58:33.250
They are coming.

1:58:42.350 --> 1:58:44.350
We apologize for being late.

1:58:45.050 --> 1:58:47.750
-Are they finished?
-All of them, Mother Hayme.

1:58:48.916 --> 1:58:51.783
How did they turn out?
Are they worth taking to the market?

1:58:51.950 --> 1:58:53.250
Show me one to see.

1:59:01.116 --> 1:59:03.016
How is it, Hanim, is it good?

1:59:04.450 --> 1:59:07.450
I have never seen such vibrant colors
in my life.

1:59:08.416 --> 1:59:10.850
Good. Load these drapes as well.

1:59:11.783 --> 1:59:13.316
The caravan may leave.

2:00:01.916 --> 2:00:02.950
Come.

2:00:05.083 --> 2:00:08.950
The caravan left the village, sir.
Suleyman Shah’s son Gundogdu is leading.

2:01:07.950 --> 2:01:10.683
Come closer. Come to me.

2:01:15.816 --> 2:01:18.250
The flood has passed and sand is left.

2:01:19.250 --> 2:01:23.716
Thank God, we did not need to bow
our heads in shame in front of our men.

2:01:24.650 --> 2:01:29.283
You worked very hard. After cleaning up,
you may all go and rest.

2:01:30.650 --> 2:01:33.450
Come on now. Selcan, come with me.

2:01:38.316 --> 2:01:41.850
There is an issue
I wanted to talk with you for a long time.

2:01:42.016 --> 2:01:43.450
I am listening, mother.

2:01:44.816 --> 2:01:50.950
My girl, after your mother and
father died, you and your sister Gokce...

2:01:51.116 --> 2:01:57.950
...were entrusted with us. I tried not to
discriminate you from my own children.

2:01:58.883 --> 2:02:01.350
May our lives be sacrificed for you,
Mother Hayme.

2:02:01.683 --> 2:02:04.950
Did we commit a crime without knowing?
Did we break your heart?

2:02:05.250 --> 2:02:09.916
No, nothing like that. The thing I want
to say is completely different.

2:02:11.316 --> 2:02:16.250
Gokce has grown, she got very beautiful.
She became a very proper girl.

2:02:17.950 --> 2:02:19.916
We need to wed her soon.

2:02:20.883 --> 2:02:24.816
You are right, mother. I was also thinking
the same thing for a long time.

2:02:26.216 --> 2:02:27.716
Well...

2:02:28.816 --> 2:02:30.950
...who are we going to wed her with?

2:02:32.650 --> 2:02:37.816
If you give consent as well, Ertugrul
and Gokce should grow old together.

2:02:40.216 --> 2:02:43.850
Please, Mother Hayme, who am I to have
a say in something like this?

2:02:44.950 --> 2:02:48.416
Don’t say that.
You raised her since she was very little.

2:02:49.350 --> 2:02:53.983
I wanted to ask you first.
You can inquire and see her reaction.

2:02:54.650 --> 2:02:57.816
I will go immediately, Mother Hayme.
I am going right now.

2:05:44.716 --> 2:05:48.016
<i>The pigeon wing’s final destination</i>
 <i>is the wolf’s mouth.</i>

2:05:48.950 --> 2:05:50.816
<i>Suleyman Shah’s son, Ertugrul.</i>

2:06:38.316 --> 2:06:39.716
Attack!

2:08:39.150 --> 2:08:41.750
We expected a big welcome
with drums and all.

2:08:41.983 --> 2:08:44.916
-This is strange.
-Everyone must have finished their job.

2:08:45.083 --> 2:08:48.683
The caravan must be on its way as well.
Everyone is probably resting.

2:08:48.983 --> 2:08:51.983
You carry on. I will visit my father.

2:09:14.750 --> 2:09:15.883
Stop!
