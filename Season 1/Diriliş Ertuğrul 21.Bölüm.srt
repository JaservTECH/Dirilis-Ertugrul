Episode 21 will start after 12:12 min

12:12.333 --> 12:15.333
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:17.090 --> 12:20.090
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:21.271 --> 12:24.271
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:48.365 --> 12:49.765
God is Hakk!

12:52.431 --> 12:54.098
God is Hakk!

12:55.731 --> 12:57.298
God is Hakk!

12:57.531 --> 12:59.198
God is Hakk!

13:00.265 --> 13:02.165
Catch them!

13:02.465 --> 13:03.965
Catch them!

13:06.698 --> 13:08.298
Catch them!

13:11.098 --> 13:12.098
Catch them!

13:12.198 --> 13:15.131
Kayi Tent

13:23.965 --> 13:26.698
Why do you think Kurdoglu put us here?

13:27.731 --> 13:31.164
I do not like the way Turgut looks at us.

13:33.198 --> 13:35.965
Ertugrul said he recovered, but...

13:37.698 --> 13:40.365
That is exactly why he put us here.

13:41.098 --> 13:44.065
To scare and suppress us.

13:45.331 --> 13:47.765
His hands and feet are tied up.

13:48.065 --> 13:49.431
For now.

13:50.198 --> 13:52.531
You never know who unties him.

13:56.198 --> 13:58.664
What is going to happen now, Suleyman?

13:58.765 --> 14:03.131
He will do as much as he can
to make them give the decision he wants.

14:04.331 --> 14:10.031
I knew he would do all kinds of violence,
vileness and betrayal.

14:11.164 --> 14:13.531
But I was not expecting this early.

14:13.631 --> 14:15.998
You took all kinds of precautions.

14:16.665 --> 14:20.698
You could not have known the beys
in the tent would be such corrupt.

14:20.965 --> 14:23.598
I did not take all kinds of precautions.

14:23.731 --> 14:25.531
I showed mercy.

14:25.998 --> 14:30.565
This is how it ends if you show mercy
to the head of the instigations.

14:31.431 --> 14:34.531
You and your children,
give your blessings to me.

14:36.065 --> 14:37.698
I put you in trouble.

14:40.298 --> 14:42.498
Do not worry about us.

14:42.598 --> 14:46.465
We will be proud even to die
if it is for you.

14:47.465 --> 14:49.665
Besides, Ertugrul is still away.

14:49.731 --> 14:52.431
He must have heard of what happened.

14:52.531 --> 14:54.665
What can he do by himself?

14:55.531 --> 14:58.331
Let us pray that he does not come here.

14:58.398 --> 15:02.098
Or he will end up like us.

16:03.431 --> 16:05.165
Dogan!

16:05.231 --> 16:06.598
Bamsi!

16:15.265 --> 16:18.465
Bey, why did we not attack them
instead of running away?

16:20.265 --> 16:21.731
We are not running away, Bamsi.

16:21.998 --> 16:25.165
We are luring them to the places
where we can fight in equal conditions.

16:25.231 --> 16:28.498
We will kill them all
until we reach our horses.

16:43.598 --> 16:47.265
You four, this way.
The rest will come with me.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.431
Dogan!

18:01.031 --> 18:02.998
Let go of me!

18:05.031 --> 18:08.298
Let go of me! Do not touch my arm!

18:08.765 --> 18:10.665
Let go of me!

18:10.765 --> 18:12.631
Do not touch me!

18:13.265 --> 18:15.398
Go to hell!

18:15.465 --> 18:17.265
Burn in flames!

18:17.365 --> 18:20.498
How could you be the
servants of that bastard Kurdoglu?

18:20.565 --> 18:23.965
-Selcan Hatun, be good or...
-Or what?

18:24.598 --> 18:27.198
Or I will decapitate you!

18:47.065 --> 18:50.398
She killed my baby!

18:56.598 --> 18:58.398
Selcan Hatun...

18:59.165 --> 19:00.998
Come here, have a seat.

19:18.165 --> 19:20.465
They did not touch you, did they?

19:23.665 --> 19:26.765
Any news from
Suleyman Shah and Mother Hayme?

19:27.031 --> 19:29.165
No news from my father, either.

19:31.531 --> 19:34.265
-What if they kill them?
-Sisters!

19:34.431 --> 19:36.298
Pull yourselves together.

19:36.365 --> 19:39.731
That bastard will not be
able to bring us to our knees.

19:40.598 --> 19:45.165
Both Mother Hayme
and Suleyman Shah would not give up.

19:45.765 --> 19:49.398
That coward Kurdoglu
cannot do anything to them.

19:50.198 --> 19:54.098
Wild Demir is such an experienced warrior.

19:55.031 --> 19:57.665
God knows he will not give up, either.

20:00.665 --> 20:02.765
What is going to happen now?

20:03.631 --> 20:06.131
Kurdoglu broke the order of the tent.

20:08.098 --> 20:10.098
He went against the tradition.

20:10.198 --> 20:13.331
Look what you did
to the Kayi Tent, Kurdoglu.

20:14.131 --> 20:19.031
How could they do this
to Suleyman Shah and our Mother Hayme?

20:19.131 --> 20:20.431
How?

20:20.531 --> 20:25.165
He tried to come to the throne
with tricks after he lost the election.

20:27.598 --> 20:30.331
So, he was the traitor in the tent.

20:30.431 --> 20:32.565
He disguised himself very well.

21:03.665 --> 21:05.165
Untie him!

21:07.331 --> 21:08.731
Do not touch me.

21:10.165 --> 21:14.231
This my armor of pride, Kurdoglu.

21:15.531 --> 21:20.631
I will never take these off
before I put them around your neck.

21:22.731 --> 21:26.298
If I do not succeed,
then I will be buried with them.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.465
Wild Demir...

21:28.598 --> 21:34.398
...you forged so much iron
with your hammer for such a long time...

21:34.698 --> 21:38.298
...but you could not
forge your mind and heart.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.265
You are still wild.

21:41.298 --> 21:43.431
Kurdoglu...

21:43.565 --> 21:46.098
Our ancestors named you "Kurdoglu".

21:46.198 --> 21:47.965
Why?

21:48.465 --> 21:52.165
Obviously, they saw talent in you
while you were a child.

21:52.965 --> 21:55.431
But you could not protect your heart.

21:55.565 --> 21:58.365
You sold your heart
to the Devil, Kurdoglu.

21:59.531 --> 22:05.198
I have been working so hard for such a
long time for the future of my tent.

22:05.298 --> 22:10.265
However, Suleyman Shah and his children
dragged us from one danger to another.

22:11.265 --> 22:13.465
I warned them a lot of times...

22:13.598 --> 22:15.431
...but they did not listen to me.

22:15.531 --> 22:18.498
-And then, they lost their crown.
-Kurdoglu!

22:18.598 --> 22:20.131
Cut it short!

22:20.698 --> 22:22.965
Say what you are going to say.

22:32.565 --> 22:35.998
I would like to grant you
a final opportunity.

22:36.165 --> 22:38.798
Obey me as the new bey.

22:38.898 --> 22:41.198
Let us turn our tent
into how it was before.

22:41.265 --> 22:43.898
You and your daughter will be at ease.

22:44.865 --> 22:46.998
Kurdoglu...

22:47.098 --> 22:50.131
I will never obey you.

22:50.865 --> 22:55.398
If I do, persecution
will be legalized forever.

22:57.898 --> 23:01.331
And to write a history will be
impossible for the children of Kayi.

23:04.298 --> 23:10.965
After all this has passed, the children of
Kayi will remember us, not you.

23:13.165 --> 23:18.565
They will say that we never surrendered
to persecution and the persecutor.

23:21.031 --> 23:25.065
I will not obey you
if you chopped me to pieces...

23:25.898 --> 23:28.798
...let alone kill me, Kurdoglu.

23:32.365 --> 23:35.365
Take this rebel
to where Suleyman Shah is!

23:35.465 --> 23:39.131
He will see what persecution is like.

23:39.198 --> 23:41.398
Take him!

23:43.465 --> 23:45.531
Where is my daughter?

23:45.898 --> 23:48.431
Getting ready to go to hell.

23:49.865 --> 23:52.031
I said take him!

24:05.365 --> 24:08.198
If you hurt my daughter, Kurdoglu...

24:08.965 --> 24:11.265
...I will make life unbearable for you.

24:11.365 --> 24:13.198
Make no mistake about it.

24:13.331 --> 24:14.965
Take him!

25:02.131 --> 25:05.565
Wild Demir, tell our Bey
that we are very sorry.

25:08.531 --> 25:09.998
Stop, stop!

25:10.098 --> 25:13.398
Blasphemy goes on,
but persecution does not!

25:13.998 --> 25:19.298
The traitor we have been looking for
is in the marquee! Beware!

25:19.865 --> 25:21.831
Beware!

27:03.198 --> 27:04.831
This way.

27:19.398 --> 27:21.031
Master Demir!

27:21.131 --> 27:22.965
-Mother Hayme.
-Wild Demir?

27:23.131 --> 27:24.131
Bey...

27:24.198 --> 27:25.198
Are you alright?

27:25.298 --> 27:27.031
I am, Mother Hayme.

27:28.431 --> 27:30.365
We had a little commotion.

27:30.431 --> 27:32.331
Thankfully, I am alright.

27:32.431 --> 27:35.898
But the silence in the tent
breaks my heart.

27:38.098 --> 27:40.031
Blood has spilled, Wild Demir.

27:40.131 --> 27:41.565
There were casualties.

27:41.798 --> 27:45.065
Our people still did not understand
what is going on.

27:56.031 --> 27:57.165
Mother Hayme...

27:57.231 --> 27:59.998
-You will come with us.
-Where are you taking your Mother Hayme?

28:00.065 --> 28:01.298
To where the other women are.

28:01.398 --> 28:02.998
What about my children?

28:03.098 --> 28:05.265
Dundar and Gundogdu
are in Akcakoca's tent.

28:05.365 --> 28:07.031
The midwives are taking care of them.

28:07.098 --> 28:09.365
Gundogdu Bey is alright.

28:11.498 --> 28:13.931
Tell them I am alright.

28:14.031 --> 28:16.231
Do not forget what I told you.

28:16.398 --> 28:17.898
I will not, Bey.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.331
May God protect you.

28:21.431 --> 28:22.965
You, too.

28:54.798 --> 28:57.431
My biggest pain is that...

28:58.965 --> 29:01.265
...I could not use my sword.

29:01.398 --> 29:03.165
What do we do now?

29:04.365 --> 29:07.931
I hope we can survive,
so that you can fight like a sword...

29:08.031 --> 29:10.898
...after staying
in your sheath for so long.

29:11.265 --> 29:15.331
This bastard will not be
getting away with what he did, for sure.

29:16.098 --> 29:18.265
I came here from the marquee.

29:18.365 --> 29:20.398
He tried to win me over.

29:20.498 --> 29:22.231
I wish you accepted.

29:22.331 --> 29:23.931
How can I do that, Bey?

29:23.998 --> 29:25.765
He is the traitor.

29:25.831 --> 29:27.898
Did he not
sell us all out to the Crusaders?

29:27.965 --> 29:29.265
What about Aykiz?

29:29.831 --> 29:33.098
Everything happens
according to God's will.

31:40.765 --> 31:42.331
Mother Hayme!

31:46.765 --> 31:49.531
I was so worried that you would be hurt.

31:49.798 --> 31:52.131
I do not have anybody other than you.

31:53.565 --> 31:55.265
My beautiful girl.

31:56.131 --> 31:58.365
Being afraid would be unseemly of us.

31:58.431 --> 32:04.831
The persecutors will be happy
if we get devastated like this.

32:05.098 --> 32:07.098
Wipe those tears now.

32:08.531 --> 32:10.898
Smile with that beautiful face.

32:11.998 --> 32:13.931
Come on, sit by my side.

32:24.331 --> 32:26.865
How is Suleyman Shah, Mother Hayme?

32:27.831 --> 32:30.331
He is very well, my daughter.

32:31.031 --> 32:35.365
He told you not to be sorry for him,
and not to be sad.

32:37.331 --> 32:41.265
He said that we will fend off
this plague by God's will.

32:41.398 --> 32:45.465
He told you not to be worried
and to be at ease.

32:47.198 --> 32:49.265
Any news from my Gundogdu?

32:50.165 --> 32:51.931
Gundogdu is also alright.

32:51.998 --> 32:54.198
He is in Akcakoca's tent.

32:54.898 --> 32:57.065
My Dundar is with him.

32:57.131 --> 32:58.565
Thank God.

32:59.998 --> 33:02.365
Any news from my father?

33:05.198 --> 33:06.998
My beautiful girl.

33:07.065 --> 33:10.765
You know how your father is.
He is happy at all times.

33:11.398 --> 33:15.831
His madness is the biggest gift
that was granted to him.

33:16.398 --> 33:21.931
He is trying to find a way to fend off
this plague with Suleyman Shah.

33:23.898 --> 33:26.231
Can we overcome this plague, mother?

33:28.131 --> 33:29.798
My beautiful girl...

33:31.798 --> 33:34.531
God who saved
Hazrat Noah from the flood...

33:34.798 --> 33:37.198
...Hazrat Ibrahim from the fire...

33:38.531 --> 33:41.998
...Hazrat Yousuf from the well...

33:42.565 --> 33:44.965
...will hopefully
save us from this plague.

33:45.098 --> 33:47.098
-Amen.
-Amen.

33:47.531 --> 33:49.331
The only thing we can do...

33:49.431 --> 33:54.231
...is to surrender to God Almighty
as our prophets had told us...

33:54.565 --> 33:56.931
...without losing our hope.

34:26.531 --> 34:28.298
Idiots!

34:28.365 --> 34:30.131
Incompetents!

34:31.865 --> 34:35.498
Find those goat shepherds now!

34:36.365 --> 34:37.898
Sir, this is very dangerous.

34:37.998 --> 34:40.131
Move!

34:52.431 --> 34:55.298
Everything in the tent is secured now.

34:55.931 --> 34:58.865
We beheaded the ones who resisted.

35:00.231 --> 35:05.165
We have to tell the people of the tent
very well why we overthrew Suleyman Shah.

35:06.298 --> 35:10.565
He will always be a threat to us
as long as he lives in this tent.

35:13.798 --> 35:19.365
Kurdoglu, why do we not kill
Suleyman Shah?

35:21.031 --> 35:25.098
It will be persecution unless
we kill him without trying him first.

35:25.831 --> 35:28.398
But if we handle it
in the headquarters meeting...

35:28.498 --> 35:31.798
...it will legalize
everything we do, Karabudak.

35:32.165 --> 35:36.398
This will cause
the blood we spill not touch us.

35:37.165 --> 35:38.898
I admire your wit, Bey.

35:39.031 --> 35:41.231
Thank you, Kutlu Bey.

35:41.331 --> 35:44.831
We have to make the people happy
after the meeting.

35:44.898 --> 35:49.065
But first, we need to make
Suleyman Shah's kins obey us...

35:49.131 --> 35:52.831
...so that our power in the tent
will be shown legit.

39:33.331 --> 39:35.231
Bey, this way.

39:39.331 --> 39:42.398
Catch them!

39:45.231 --> 39:46.765
Catch them!

40:02.398 --> 40:06.965
I first saw Suleyman Shah
in my father's tent.

40:07.565 --> 40:10.498
Our marquee
was near Ahlat back then.

40:11.798 --> 40:14.898
Ahlat is a great city.

40:16.331 --> 40:22.131
So many saints and Alps
are buried there.

40:24.265 --> 40:28.165
It is the gate for the Turks
that opens to Anatolia.

40:29.098 --> 40:33.998
I gave birth to my Ertugrul
in that beautiful city.

40:38.498 --> 40:40.031
Anyway.

40:41.498 --> 40:45.565
Suleyman Shah was a brave young man.

40:46.465 --> 40:49.765
His fame had spread
all over the Oghuz tents.

40:52.998 --> 40:56.165
I thought my heart would stop
the moment I saw him.

40:58.365 --> 41:00.998
My father liked him very much, as well.

41:01.098 --> 41:03.931
They went to so many raids together.

41:05.098 --> 41:07.831
They conquered so many lands.

41:08.898 --> 41:13.231
Suleyman Shah
liked me very much when he first saw me.

41:14.898 --> 41:17.298
Then, one day...

41:22.998 --> 41:25.565
Kurdoglu Bey wants to see Selcan Hatun.

41:28.298 --> 41:29.931
Why is that?

41:29.998 --> 41:33.298
We do not know. Come on, Selcan Hatun.

41:39.998 --> 41:43.398
Selcan, go and find out
what that devil wants.

42:25.165 --> 42:27.398
Turgut, son...

42:27.498 --> 42:32.198
Never forget who you are
whoever whispers things to your ear.

42:32.298 --> 42:33.865
You are an honorable Alp.

42:33.965 --> 42:38.265
Do not forget that you have a loved one
who waits for you.

42:39.165 --> 42:41.398
Stand up, Turgut Alp! Come on!

43:06.565 --> 43:10.265
Bey, what is this rascal up to?

43:10.931 --> 43:15.765
All his evil acts
will come against us, Wild Demir.

43:16.898 --> 43:18.565
You are right, Bey.

43:19.265 --> 43:21.098
You are right.

43:52.965 --> 43:54.465
Welcome, Selcan Hatun.

43:55.798 --> 43:57.865
What do you want from me?

44:03.398 --> 44:06.865
You were the only woman in this tent
who understood me.

44:06.965 --> 44:10.531
We struggled so much together
for the unity of this tent.

44:10.798 --> 44:16.531
If we succeeded, this marquee
and crown would be you and your man's.

44:17.231 --> 44:19.998
But that coward man of yours
messed up everything...

44:20.098 --> 44:22.498
...and caused the tent become like this.

44:22.565 --> 44:28.131
Kurdoglu, we struggled
for Gundogdu to be the bey.

44:28.531 --> 44:29.931
He did not want it.

44:30.031 --> 44:31.965
He allied with his father.

44:32.065 --> 44:36.431
Then I understood that
it was our duty to shut up.

44:38.331 --> 44:41.831
But you revealed your true intention.

44:41.931 --> 44:46.031
You would have overthrown even Gundogdu
if he came to that crown!

44:56.065 --> 44:57.765
Oh, Selcan...

44:58.965 --> 45:02.498
Even the Devil says
"What am I good for?" when he sees you.

45:03.365 --> 45:07.231
We would have brought the world
to its knees if you were a man.

45:07.298 --> 45:09.498
Kurdoglu, what do you want from me?

45:10.565 --> 45:14.565
If you want to take
one more breath in this world...

45:14.798 --> 45:17.865
...if you want your sister live...

45:17.965 --> 45:21.265
...you will never talk about
the alliances we have made together.

45:21.365 --> 45:23.831
Otherwise, I will kill you both!

45:27.165 --> 45:30.798
I would like to give
you and Gundogdu a last chance.

45:30.898 --> 45:34.298
If Gundogdu obeys me
before the meeting...

45:35.031 --> 45:36.965
...I will save your lives.

45:38.165 --> 45:40.565
Now, go and tell this to your husband.

45:42.798 --> 45:46.931
You do not want to be called
a traitor after being the bey.

45:49.365 --> 45:52.165
I see you are in the euphoria of victory.

45:53.031 --> 45:55.365
However, you will lose!

45:56.565 --> 46:00.998
How nice.
Obey me, and we will lose together, then.

46:18.865 --> 46:20.565
Alps!

47:15.765 --> 47:17.365
Get out.

47:21.298 --> 47:23.065
I said get out!

47:48.265 --> 47:51.865
If only we had our share
from those infidels' wit.

47:54.465 --> 47:57.898
Look how they turned a sturdy Alp into.

47:59.365 --> 48:01.298
Am I right, Judas?

48:03.265 --> 48:05.198
Judas...

48:05.298 --> 48:06.865
Yes, Judas.

48:06.965 --> 48:09.231
You will be my Alp from now on.

48:10.365 --> 48:13.431
I will need brave warriors like you.

48:13.498 --> 48:17.365
And you will finish the business
you left unfinished.

48:27.798 --> 48:30.765
I am talking about Ertugrul.
Did you get it?

48:34.031 --> 48:35.298
Good.

48:36.031 --> 48:41.331
But first, I will give you duties
as important as killing that ominous boy.

48:42.231 --> 48:44.098
My right arm.

48:44.898 --> 48:46.431
My precious Alp.

49:07.365 --> 49:09.098
Gundogdu...

49:11.431 --> 49:13.465
Thank God you are alright.

49:14.065 --> 49:16.331
I am alright, woman. I am alright.

49:17.098 --> 49:18.898
Dundar...

49:20.798 --> 49:22.431
He is the same.

49:22.498 --> 49:25.465
Do not worry,
the midwives are taking care of him.

49:25.531 --> 49:27.198
How about them?

49:27.265 --> 49:30.131
My father and Wild Demir
are in the cage.

49:30.198 --> 49:32.465
They took us to another tent.

49:32.565 --> 49:34.965
Mercy leads to disaster, woman.

49:36.031 --> 49:38.765
We should not have shown him mercy.

49:38.831 --> 49:41.231
How could he do this?

49:41.298 --> 49:45.065
How could he escape
from my tricks so successfully?

49:45.165 --> 49:48.431
Either he is very clever,
or I am very stupid.

49:49.498 --> 49:51.465
I was with him just now.

49:51.531 --> 49:53.265
What does he want?

49:53.331 --> 49:55.465
He wants you to obey him.

49:57.531 --> 50:02.165
I would rather die honorably
instead of obeying him.

50:04.198 --> 50:08.465
You will not courage him no matter what.

50:09.565 --> 50:14.965
I would rather go to hell with you
instead of obeying that ominous bastard.

50:15.065 --> 50:16.998
Do not worry.

50:17.831 --> 50:20.765
Forgive me for the words I said to you.

50:20.865 --> 50:24.765
I would die if you wanted me to.

50:40.565 --> 50:45.531
When the time comes, you will not
let anybody from his family live.

50:46.965 --> 50:48.898
Do you understand?

50:49.298 --> 50:51.231
I said do you understand?

50:53.465 --> 50:55.398
Good.

50:58.931 --> 51:00.998
I will let you know.

51:01.098 --> 51:02.998
Yes, sir.

51:04.365 --> 51:06.498
Now, go and take a bath.

51:06.565 --> 51:08.365
You smell like a pig.

51:09.165 --> 51:10.965
Clean up.

51:11.065 --> 51:12.565
Put on some clothes.

51:14.031 --> 51:15.365
Look like an Alp.

51:15.465 --> 51:16.965
Here.

51:21.798 --> 51:23.898
Alps!

51:34.998 --> 51:36.765
This is my new Alp, Turgut.

51:36.831 --> 51:39.865
Take care of him. Please him.

51:39.965 --> 51:42.498
I decided that he has recovered.

51:51.098 --> 51:52.831
Come on.

52:46.065 --> 52:47.831
What did Kurdoglu say?

52:48.765 --> 52:51.831
He wants Gundogdu to obey him.

52:56.931 --> 52:59.165
He sent me to Gundogdu.

53:00.331 --> 53:01.331
And?

53:01.398 --> 53:06.431
Gundogdu said he would not obey him
even they buried him alive.

53:14.865 --> 53:18.465
He will try anything
to show himself legit.

53:18.531 --> 53:20.398
Kurdoglu!

53:21.198 --> 53:24.765
Let us see
what other games he has in store.

54:11.565 --> 54:13.965
Could they not catch them yet?

54:14.098 --> 54:15.498
No, sir.

54:16.431 --> 54:19.398
Bu we have their horses.
They cannot escape.

54:20.031 --> 54:21.765
God damn Turk!

54:23.131 --> 54:25.498
How did you come here, Titus?

54:25.565 --> 54:28.165
I turned back to the castle
from Aleppo.

54:28.231 --> 54:31.131
I found out that
you set a trap here for Ertugrul.

54:31.198 --> 54:33.498
You were right on time.

54:33.565 --> 54:35.431
I needed you.

54:36.231 --> 54:38.265
What did you do in Aleppo?

54:38.365 --> 54:40.331
We successfully did our duty, sir.

54:40.398 --> 54:42.098
We have the queen.

54:43.131 --> 54:45.498
The Ayyubid army
is looking for her everywhere.

54:45.765 --> 54:50.398
I deemed necessary to wait a while
instead of taking her to the castle.

54:51.165 --> 54:54.365
I hid Eftelya and the queen in a cave.

54:54.431 --> 54:56.165
Good thinking.

54:56.798 --> 54:58.998
Is Eftelya alone?

54:59.098 --> 55:02.531
No, my knights that I trust the most
are with her.

55:03.798 --> 55:05.531
Good.

55:11.398 --> 55:16.431
You stopped Alaeddin Kayqubad's move...

55:16.531 --> 55:21.265
...that was going to unite the
Islamic world against the Crusaders.

55:22.065 --> 55:24.065
Congratulations, son.

55:24.131 --> 55:26.431
If this marriage happened...

55:27.531 --> 55:30.865
...it would be very hard for us...

55:30.931 --> 55:33.865
...to convince the Pope
for a new Crusade.

55:35.098 --> 55:36.531
Thank you, sir.

55:36.765 --> 55:38.298
And now, Ertugrul.

55:39.365 --> 55:42.165
They will not
get out of this forest alive.

55:42.231 --> 55:44.565
We will fend off this plague.

55:45.498 --> 55:48.165
I need Ertugrul alive, Titus.

55:50.231 --> 55:51.498
Sir?

55:53.231 --> 55:54.531
Why?

55:59.465 --> 56:04.231
You know, this man always
managed to escape from us.

56:05.765 --> 56:07.431
Do what I say, Titus.

56:07.931 --> 56:10.965
This is our last opportunity to kill him.

56:13.898 --> 56:15.131
Alright.

56:16.031 --> 56:17.798
But why?

56:18.098 --> 56:25.098
Because only he knows
where the arc that Arabi carries is.

56:26.465 --> 56:29.131
You have to bring him to me alive.

56:32.898 --> 56:35.865
This may be our last chance to kill him.

56:37.865 --> 56:40.065
Do what I say, Titus!

56:40.931 --> 56:46.298
That arc is much more valuable for me
than that ominous Turk.

56:59.231 --> 57:00.931
What is going to happen now?

57:02.098 --> 57:04.765
This is against our tradition.

57:07.965 --> 57:11.431
What will happen
to Suleyman Shah's family?

58:22.198 --> 58:26.131
From now on,
we want to have peace in this nomad tent.

58:26.798 --> 58:30.898
The ones who go against this,
will definitely end up like Suleyman.

58:32.198 --> 58:36.465
I will be against the ones
who do not want peace and wealth!

58:38.498 --> 58:40.465
Kurdoglu, what did you do?

58:41.065 --> 58:43.231
Raiding the marquee in the night...

58:43.298 --> 58:46.031
...and be the bey by stabbing the bey
from his back is unheard of.

58:46.131 --> 58:49.398
-This will not bring peace to the tent.
-He is right!

58:49.465 --> 58:52.165
-He is right!
-You cannot be a bey like this.

58:52.231 --> 58:54.798
It is against our tradition.

58:55.865 --> 58:57.131
He is right.

59:00.898 --> 59:04.331
-You cannot be a bey like this.
-It is against our tradition.

01:00:04.965 --> 01:00:10.685
It is a shame for our tradition, our
people, the Kayi's, the Oghuz generation.

01:00:12.085 --> 01:00:15.205
What you are doing
is definitely persecution.

01:00:15.285 --> 01:00:18.165
Shame on you. Both as a man, and as a bey.

01:00:28.965 --> 01:00:31.485
So, were you the traitor?

01:00:36.765 --> 01:00:39.765
Were you the traitor
who made the tent suffer so much?

01:00:40.925 --> 01:00:43.125
Was it you, Kurdoglu?

01:01:45.325 --> 01:01:47.405
There are three traitors...

01:01:48.485 --> 01:01:51.765
...in this tent
who allied with the Crusaders.

01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:56.605
Baybora, Alpargu and Sarikayin.

01:01:59.605 --> 01:02:01.365
All of them paid for it.

01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:05.045
And he was the fourth.

01:02:06.165 --> 01:02:09.525
There are not any traitors left
in our nomad tent.

01:02:09.645 --> 01:02:12.045
And I will not allow betrayal anymore.

01:02:12.165 --> 01:02:15.765
This traitor matter is closed now.

01:02:20.605 --> 01:02:23.445
Now...

01:02:23.525 --> 01:02:28.365
...I'll start the meeting regarding the
decision on Suleyman and his family.

01:02:37.365 --> 01:02:38.925
Alps...

01:02:39.045 --> 01:02:40.725
Bring Suleyman here.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:25.325
Shah Suleyman,
they want you to come to the meeting.

01:03:28.645 --> 01:03:30.885
Let us see what they've decided on us.

01:03:30.965 --> 01:03:33.285
They cannot make a negative decision, Bey.

01:03:33.365 --> 01:03:37.725
It would be a shame.
The beys would not let that happen.

01:04:17.325 --> 01:04:18.805
You are our bey!

01:04:20.205 --> 01:04:21.965
Forgive us, Shah!

01:04:22.045 --> 01:04:23.685
Kurdoglu will pay for it!

01:04:23.805 --> 01:04:25.525
Justice will be done!

01:04:36.645 --> 01:04:38.045
Traitor Kurdoglu!

01:04:38.445 --> 01:04:40.165
Shah Suleyman, you are our bey!

01:04:40.285 --> 01:04:41.765
Let go of our bey!

01:05:00.765 --> 01:05:02.205
You are our bey!

01:05:24.485 --> 01:05:25.885
You are our bey!

01:05:26.885 --> 01:05:28.965
Forgive us, Shah!

01:05:34.565 --> 01:05:37.125
Shah Suleyman, you are our bey!

01:05:37.805 --> 01:05:39.445
Forgive us, Bey! Forgive us!

01:05:39.525 --> 01:05:42.685
-Bey! Shah Suleyman!
-God will punish him, Bey!

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:45.885
He will surely punish him
by way of somebody among us!

01:06:14.725 --> 01:06:17.405
The honorable beys of Kayi...

01:06:17.485 --> 01:06:21.605
Our nomad tent will not have peace...

01:06:21.725 --> 01:06:24.765
...as long as Suleyman and his sons live.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:30.645
My wish is that Suleyman and his sons
be hung immediately.

01:06:36.405 --> 01:06:39.005
And the women of the family go into exile.

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:46.045
I would like to have your
valuable opinions on this matter.

01:07:04.005 --> 01:07:09.365
Your silence shows that
everybody agrees with me.

01:07:13.445 --> 01:07:15.325
Bey Akdemir wants to say something.

01:07:15.405 --> 01:07:17.325
I suppose he will support me.

01:07:18.565 --> 01:07:23.085
Shah Suleyman has been our bey
for many years.

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:26.965
He worked so hard for the unity
and wealth of our nomad tent.

01:07:27.045 --> 01:07:28.045
He is right.

01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:30.765
He lost his children
and his first wife for this cause.

01:07:30.885 --> 01:07:33.805
He did not have peace even for a day.

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:39.165
He laid eyes neither on our food
nor other women.

01:07:39.285 --> 01:07:40.685
Of course!

01:07:40.845 --> 01:07:42.885
We never saw such a thing. You are right.

01:07:42.965 --> 01:07:44.805
Akdemir is right.

01:07:44.885 --> 01:07:46.725
-He is right.
-Yes, he is right.

01:07:46.805 --> 01:07:49.125
You are right, Akdemir.

01:07:50.285 --> 01:07:52.885
So did Bey Gundogdu and Bey Ertugrul.

01:07:55.525 --> 01:07:58.125
What I am saying is that...

01:07:58.245 --> 01:08:03.205
...let them go into exile
instead of being hung.

01:08:04.725 --> 01:08:06.605
You are right, Akdemir.

01:08:08.405 --> 01:08:12.325
However, let them know that
they will be killed without mercy...

01:08:12.405 --> 01:08:14.965
...if they come near the nomad tent.

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:17.245
Akdemir is right.

01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:20.965
-Yes, let us exile them.
-Let us exile them.

01:08:29.165 --> 01:08:30.965
Mercy leads to disaster.

01:08:32.005 --> 01:08:37.565
However, it is my duty as your bey
to confront this disaster...

01:08:37.685 --> 01:08:39.925
...that will result from showing mercy.

01:08:40.045 --> 01:08:42.205
My heart also aches.

01:08:43.445 --> 01:08:45.405
Suleyman is my blood brother.

01:08:45.525 --> 01:08:47.565
He is my life. My brother.

01:08:48.285 --> 01:08:51.445
I brought Gundogdu and Ertugrul up.

01:08:51.565 --> 01:08:56.485
I would like you to know how hard it is
for me to take this decision.

01:08:58.605 --> 01:09:04.125
However, as this is your opinion,
I can only accept this.

01:09:05.565 --> 01:09:08.285
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:09:09.285 --> 01:09:10.965
Bring Shah Suleyman in.

01:09:11.085 --> 01:09:12.365
Bey Kurdoglu is waiting for you.

01:09:12.445 --> 01:09:14.765
Do not let our bey in!

01:09:52.845 --> 01:09:54.965
Take him out!

01:10:04.805 --> 01:10:08.125
So they killed you too, Yagiz?

01:10:15.405 --> 01:10:20.205
Suleyman, the decision about
you and your family has been taken.

01:10:21.005 --> 01:10:24.645
It is my duty to inform you
of this decision to your face.

01:10:24.765 --> 01:10:29.285
You and your family will go into exile
from the nomad tent tomorrow.

01:10:33.085 --> 01:10:37.045
However, you will be killed
without mercy...

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:39.925
...if you come near our nomad tent.

01:10:41.845 --> 01:10:43.805
Do you have anything to say?

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:50.805
I only say a word to the one
who knows his traditions.

01:10:55.605 --> 01:10:58.365
However, you should know that...

01:10:58.485 --> 01:11:00.965
...this world has seen so many pharaohs.

01:11:01.125 --> 01:11:02.845
And Nimrods.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.365
And Abu Jahls.

01:11:05.525 --> 01:11:10.245
But Hazrat Ibrahim's cause prevailed.

01:11:13.525 --> 01:11:18.365
You should know that
I become a martyr if you kill me.

01:11:20.645 --> 01:11:23.565
I become an exile if you exile me.

01:11:25.405 --> 01:11:28.245
I become a monk if you imprison me.

01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:32.685
I would thank God and forget it.

01:11:49.165 --> 01:11:51.005
Suleyman...

01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:56.045
...tomorrow, you will be sent to
Bey Korkut's nomad tent.

01:11:59.845 --> 01:12:02.085
God help the Kayis.

01:12:02.205 --> 01:12:04.245
Amen!

01:12:08.165 --> 01:12:09.645
Take him!

01:13:51.925 --> 01:13:55.085
Did they make a decision, Bey?

01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:57.205
It was as you mentioned.

01:13:57.325 --> 01:14:01.325
He could not convince the beys
to kill me and my sons.

01:14:01.925 --> 01:14:03.565
Thank God.

01:14:03.645 --> 01:14:05.445
They will exile us.

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:09.045
And you will share this fate with us.

01:14:09.165 --> 01:14:12.605
Thank God, Bey. May our fate be your fate.

01:14:14.725 --> 01:14:16.725
Where are we going to go?

01:14:17.485 --> 01:14:20.725
To Hayme's brother Korkut's nomad tent.

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:26.285
Kurdoglu must not be happy
about this decision.

01:14:26.925 --> 01:14:32.005
He is scared that you and Korkut
will take hold of the seigniory together.

01:14:33.445 --> 01:14:36.885
They will not send us
to Korkut's nomad tent, anyway.

01:14:39.245 --> 01:14:40.685
You are right, Bey.

01:14:41.405 --> 01:14:45.045
They will think about a plan for us
on the way there.

01:14:51.565 --> 01:14:53.605
Son! Gundogdu!

01:14:53.725 --> 01:14:54.725
Are you alright?

01:14:54.845 --> 01:14:56.085
I am, father.

01:15:18.325 --> 01:15:20.165
I heard about the decision.

01:15:21.605 --> 01:15:24.685
They have decided to kill us on the way.

01:15:27.285 --> 01:15:29.445
We must escape immediately.

01:15:32.405 --> 01:15:37.245
Or they will kill not only us,
but also the women on the way.

01:15:54.085 --> 01:15:57.565
Hayme Hatun, it was decided
that you will go into exile.

01:15:57.685 --> 01:16:00.525
You will set off as soon as possible.

01:16:12.725 --> 01:16:16.685
So he is kicking us out of the nomad tent
we have been living in for so many years.

01:16:16.765 --> 01:16:19.725
What a cruel man you are, Kurdoglu.

01:16:20.245 --> 01:16:24.045
A shameless man
who does not care about God.

01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:29.365
How can a brother persecute another,
just for the sake of the crown?

01:16:30.365 --> 01:16:33.205
He does not care about exiling us.

01:16:33.325 --> 01:16:35.805
He cannot kill us in front of the people.

01:16:35.885 --> 01:16:40.005
His intention is to kill us
under the pretext of exiling us.

01:16:42.445 --> 01:16:44.005
He can go to hell.

01:16:44.765 --> 01:16:47.565
It is our duty
to go against persecution...

01:16:48.365 --> 01:16:52.605
...even though we know
we are going to be killed.

01:16:54.245 --> 01:16:56.525
This will be our Karbala.

01:16:59.005 --> 01:17:03.445
We will neither be sad nor whine.

01:17:15.325 --> 01:17:18.005
Finally, we have overcome
the Shah Suleyman plague.

01:17:18.125 --> 01:17:19.845
Not yet.

01:17:19.925 --> 01:17:23.205
Every breath he takes
is a big threat for us.

01:17:24.125 --> 01:17:26.045
What is your plan, Bey?

01:17:26.805 --> 01:17:32.005
The Angel of Death must cross his path
with Suleyman and his family on the way.

01:17:34.565 --> 01:17:38.045
Bey, there is no need
to cover our weapons with blood.

01:17:38.765 --> 01:17:43.645
If this is heard in the nomad tent,
we won't be able to keep it together.

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:45.645
Are you scared?

01:17:46.965 --> 01:17:48.245
Listen, gentlemen...

01:17:48.325 --> 01:17:51.285
If you cannot guess two steps further...

01:17:51.365 --> 01:17:53.445
...you cannot continue being the bey.

01:17:53.565 --> 01:17:57.165
Shah Suleyman could not,
and lost his crown.

01:17:58.605 --> 01:18:01.085
If he had not shown mercy to me...

01:18:01.165 --> 01:18:04.365
...the crown would be his,
and the tomb would be mine.

01:18:04.525 --> 01:18:07.685
However, I will not show mercy to him.

01:18:09.765 --> 01:18:11.485
What about Ertugrul?

01:18:13.525 --> 01:18:15.525
I have games for him, too.

01:18:17.165 --> 01:18:21.205
He will taste death when the time comes.

01:18:36.525 --> 01:18:39.565
Bey, is this bastard
the head of the Templars?

01:18:40.485 --> 01:18:42.005
Yes, he is.

01:18:42.605 --> 01:18:46.645
I cannot believe
Isadora has such a low-down uncle.

01:18:48.565 --> 01:18:52.005
-Let me go and cut his head off!
-Wait, you big bear.

01:18:55.045 --> 01:18:57.925
Bey, we can kill half of them
until we die.

01:18:58.005 --> 01:19:00.165
And the other half will kill us.

01:19:01.205 --> 01:19:03.445
Dogan is right, Bamsi.

01:19:03.565 --> 01:19:05.445
It is not about dying or not.

01:19:05.525 --> 01:19:10.005
If we die before we solve our nomad tent's
problem, it will be for nothing.

01:19:10.165 --> 01:19:15.005
Bey, I do not understand
how they made us fall into their trap.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:17.245
Do you think Isadora...

01:19:17.605 --> 01:19:22.005
No. I think they found out
that Isadora was with us.

01:19:22.765 --> 01:19:26.085
They must have made us
fall into the trap by using her.

01:19:26.205 --> 01:19:28.525
Then, Isadora...

01:19:33.405 --> 01:19:37.365
Then, her father Omer
who was Ibn al-Arabi's disciple...

01:19:37.485 --> 01:19:38.845
Yes, him too.

01:19:38.965 --> 01:19:42.005
My poor sister! Poor man!

01:19:44.845 --> 01:19:46.245
Bastards!

01:20:18.885 --> 01:20:21.085
Ertugrul!

01:20:22.405 --> 01:20:25.245
Now, listen to me carefully!

01:20:25.885 --> 01:20:28.445
I will not repeat this.

01:20:29.005 --> 01:20:33.005
While you set off
towards my trap for you...

01:20:33.085 --> 01:20:37.245
...Kurdoglu overthrew your father
and became the new bey.

01:20:39.325 --> 01:20:44.205
From now on, he is
the new owner of the Kayi's marquee.

01:20:46.845 --> 01:20:50.765
Your father, your mother, Gundogdu...

01:20:51.605 --> 01:20:56.885
...and everybody from your family
is in Kurdoglu's hands now.

01:20:56.965 --> 01:21:02.005
And of course,
your loved one, Sultan Halime!

01:21:13.885 --> 01:21:15.725
Kurdoglu you traitor!

01:21:17.725 --> 01:21:20.445
The real traitor is you, Ertugrul!

01:21:20.725 --> 01:21:24.845
Your father lost his crown because of you!

01:21:25.685 --> 01:21:28.125
I will bring your order down!

01:21:28.925 --> 01:21:33.205
Neither your power nor your lifetime
will suffice for that.

01:21:34.165 --> 01:21:37.645
I will fight your order
with all the power I have!

01:21:37.765 --> 01:21:39.165
As for my lifetime...

01:21:39.285 --> 01:21:43.845
...those of my generation
will root out the crusaders.

01:21:43.925 --> 01:21:47.205
Ertugrul, if you surrender...

01:21:47.325 --> 01:21:51.605
...I will let your family
and Sultan Halime live.

01:21:51.725 --> 01:21:53.565
What do you want?

01:21:53.645 --> 01:21:56.725
Arabi's ark.

01:21:58.605 --> 01:22:01.245
Bey, what is this bastard saying?

01:22:01.405 --> 01:22:04.365
It was a secret that nobody knew
except Halime and me.

01:22:04.445 --> 01:22:05.885
How can he know?

01:22:06.765 --> 01:22:09.205
Is what he's saying true, Bey?

01:22:09.285 --> 01:22:10.885
It is.

01:22:12.045 --> 01:22:15.085
I would not have told you
even if I knew where it was.

01:22:15.205 --> 01:22:16.925
I know you do.

01:22:18.645 --> 01:22:21.765
-How?
-I know everything.

01:22:22.365 --> 01:22:24.405
I will never tell you!

01:22:27.965 --> 01:22:30.765
I told you he would never give up, sir.

01:22:31.925 --> 01:22:34.205
We need to get out of here, Bey!

01:22:34.325 --> 01:22:37.965
-If Kurdoglu took hold of the tent...
-He will kill everybody.

01:22:38.045 --> 01:22:40.125
The beys would not allow that.

01:22:40.245 --> 01:22:41.885
What do we do now, Bey?

01:22:42.005 --> 01:22:43.925
We have to go to the tent immediately.

01:22:44.045 --> 01:22:45.765
Give me your blessings.

01:22:47.485 --> 01:22:49.405
You have our blessings, Bey.

01:23:29.725 --> 01:23:31.445
These are all traitors.

01:23:33.965 --> 01:23:35.725
-Traitors!
-Let go of me!

01:24:28.485 --> 01:24:29.765
Let go of our bey!

01:24:29.925 --> 01:24:31.245
Let go of him!

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:38.565
Let me go!

01:25:32.045 --> 01:25:33.965
The people of Kayi!

01:25:38.485 --> 01:25:40.445
What is this outburst?

01:25:40.565 --> 01:25:42.445
What kind of rebellion is this?

01:25:42.525 --> 01:25:44.685
What kind of tactlessness is this?

01:25:48.525 --> 01:25:51.805
I saved you from the traitor beys.

01:25:51.885 --> 01:25:56.805
You did not say anything to the bey
who has been harming you for so long.

01:25:56.925 --> 01:26:00.925
But you get hostile against the bey
who tries to bring you peace.

01:26:12.685 --> 01:26:16.285
We will take our goods to Aleppo
and earn money.

01:26:17.285 --> 01:26:20.685
We will take our flocks
to more abundant lands.

01:26:21.925 --> 01:26:25.165
I've worked for everybody to be happy.

01:26:27.285 --> 01:26:29.725
I've struggled for this to the death.

01:26:34.365 --> 01:26:36.245
People of Kayi!

01:26:45.525 --> 01:26:47.565
I forgive this traitor.

01:26:55.405 --> 01:26:57.245
Now...

01:26:57.405 --> 01:26:59.885
...as my last words...

01:26:59.965 --> 01:27:04.405
...whoever creates a commotion
or tries to start a rebellion...

01:27:05.485 --> 01:27:10.285
...I will hang him
in front of the nomad tent!

01:27:14.965 --> 01:27:16.605
Go back to your work now!

01:27:17.805 --> 01:27:19.765
You will pay for this one day!

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:07.245
I want Ertugrul alive!

01:28:08.285 --> 01:28:09.885
I want him alive!

01:28:33.965 --> 01:28:35.645
I want him alive!

01:30:15.285 --> 01:30:20.645
Master, thank God
I became a Muslim because of you.

01:31:08.205 --> 01:31:09.645
Ertugrul!

01:31:10.245 --> 01:31:11.845
Drop your sword!

01:31:12.765 --> 01:31:14.445
Or your Alps will die.

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:05.485
Bey...

01:32:05.605 --> 01:32:07.245
...we must escape today.

01:32:07.325 --> 01:32:09.525
They will chain us all on the way.

01:32:09.605 --> 01:32:11.605
They will kill us all like birds.

01:32:11.725 --> 01:32:13.645
We can neither fight nor escape.

01:32:13.725 --> 01:32:15.165
Shall we escape tonight?

01:32:15.285 --> 01:32:17.085
I am positive, father.

01:32:17.405 --> 01:32:19.005
But, how?

01:32:19.925 --> 01:32:22.605
It is difficult to get out of here.

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:26.525
Say we escaped.

01:32:26.605 --> 01:32:28.365
How are we going to save our women?

01:32:28.445 --> 01:32:30.565
If we manage to escape...

01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:34.125
...the ones who do not want
Kurdoglu will revolt.

01:32:34.525 --> 01:32:37.845
If we can go to Uncle Korkut...

01:32:37.925 --> 01:32:41.565
...we can overthrow Kurdoglu
with his Alps. The Alps are upset.

01:32:41.685 --> 01:32:44.045
They want you, not Kurdoglu.

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:48.165
They do not say anything
because they do not want a civil var.

01:32:48.245 --> 01:32:49.405
As for the women...

01:32:50.845 --> 01:32:52.605
He cannot do anything to them.

01:32:52.685 --> 01:32:56.605
He has to let them live
to use them against us.

01:32:58.765 --> 01:33:00.445
What if they catch us?

01:33:02.325 --> 01:33:06.485
If they catch us,
we will think about it then.

01:33:41.285 --> 01:33:44.285
Where is Arabi's ark?

01:33:46.125 --> 01:33:48.365
It is a secret between us.

01:33:48.445 --> 01:33:50.245
It cannot be told.

01:34:03.245 --> 01:34:05.965
Are you going to
save your family like this?

01:34:06.085 --> 01:34:08.565
Is it more valuable than your family?

01:34:08.965 --> 01:34:10.525
Talk.

01:34:13.645 --> 01:34:17.725
One who cannot save a secret,
cannot save anybody.

01:34:32.165 --> 01:34:34.245
That is enough, Titus.

01:34:44.885 --> 01:34:46.285
Good.

01:34:48.885 --> 01:34:51.965
Kurdoglu fulfilled his duty, Ertugrul.

01:34:56.245 --> 01:34:59.645
Your family will be exiled in the morning.

01:34:59.765 --> 01:35:04.765
Your Alp Turgut will escort them
all the way, of course.

01:35:06.205 --> 01:35:11.365
You understand I mean the way to hell.

01:35:16.685 --> 01:35:18.165
You are lying!

01:35:19.605 --> 01:35:26.485
Your father thinks he will be going to
your uncle Korkut's tent with this family.

01:35:28.325 --> 01:35:33.205
You are surprised that I know
where he will be going, are you not?

01:35:34.805 --> 01:35:37.765
I do not need to lie to you.

01:35:40.245 --> 01:35:43.245
The only thing I want is for you...

01:35:43.365 --> 01:35:49.045
...to give me what I want in order
for your family to get there safely.

01:35:51.285 --> 01:35:53.365
Do you understand?

01:36:01.325 --> 01:36:04.085
I will never tell you where that ark is.

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:06.765
God damned Turk!

01:36:08.125 --> 01:36:10.325
I will take you to the castle.

01:36:11.325 --> 01:36:15.805
I will do to you and your Alps
what I did to Turgut.

01:36:16.725 --> 01:36:21.245
I will throw your loved ones' corpses
into your dungeon!

01:36:21.885 --> 01:36:25.925
You will live together
with their rotten flesh.

01:36:27.085 --> 01:36:31.405
Until the time you become my knight.

01:36:32.725 --> 01:36:37.965
And then, you will take me to Arabi's ark.

01:36:50.605 --> 01:36:51.765
Sir...

01:36:51.845 --> 01:36:54.325
Are you really going to
take them to the castle?

01:36:54.405 --> 01:36:58.085
Set off now and bring the queen.

01:36:58.165 --> 01:37:00.005
Let the game begin.

01:37:25.445 --> 01:37:29.245
Kurdoglu will not leave the throne
in the nomad tent, mother.

01:37:29.365 --> 01:37:32.525
Shah Suleyman
must be thinking of a solution.

01:37:36.485 --> 01:37:39.845
I wish Bey Ertugrul came
as soon as possible.

01:37:39.925 --> 01:37:41.765
He would save us all.

01:37:50.045 --> 01:37:53.205
We must find a solution
until my Ertugrul comes.

01:37:54.285 --> 01:38:00.045
Kurdoglu will want to kill us
with his men on the way to the tent.

01:38:04.405 --> 01:38:06.285
It may be Alp Turgut.

01:38:07.005 --> 01:38:09.005
Turgut will not kill us.

01:38:09.685 --> 01:38:10.725
He cannot.

01:38:10.845 --> 01:38:13.205
I saw him entering Kurdoglu's tent.

01:38:13.325 --> 01:38:15.365
He is at his service.

01:38:15.685 --> 01:38:17.405
Selcan...

01:38:17.525 --> 01:38:19.085
Heaven forbid.

01:38:19.285 --> 01:38:21.605
Ertugrul will surely come on time.

01:38:23.685 --> 01:38:26.885
You will see that tomorrow is another day.

01:38:26.965 --> 01:38:28.485
Hopefully.

01:38:29.445 --> 01:38:33.165
If my Turgut attempts to do this...

01:38:35.125 --> 01:38:38.765
...you know that
it is my duty to take his life.

01:39:05.885 --> 01:39:07.805
Get out of our way!

01:39:10.605 --> 01:39:11.845
Move, man!

01:39:11.965 --> 01:39:12.965
We will pass!

01:39:13.085 --> 01:39:14.805
Come and move me, then.

01:40:14.125 --> 01:40:18.085
God will give you an important duty.

01:40:18.205 --> 01:40:19.725
Of course, master.

01:40:23.965 --> 01:40:26.165
One of your brothers is in trouble.

01:40:26.285 --> 01:40:28.005
You will help him.

01:40:29.045 --> 01:40:32.205
You will save him
from the hands of persecutors.

01:40:32.645 --> 01:40:35.805
He will be your brother of faith
in both worlds.

01:40:36.285 --> 01:40:38.925
You will serve Islam together with him.

01:40:39.045 --> 01:40:40.565
Of course, master.

01:40:42.405 --> 01:40:46.085
I will do whatever I can with God's help.

01:40:58.085 --> 01:41:00.885
I brought you greetings from Ibn al-Arabi.

01:41:15.931 --> 01:41:18.231
Just like the old days, Bey.

01:41:20.398 --> 01:41:22.898
I had three Alps back in the day.

01:41:28.198 --> 01:41:30.331
I also have three Alps now.

01:41:31.131 --> 01:41:34.431
One of them is hunting. Ertugrul.

01:41:34.531 --> 01:41:37.098
One of them is by my side. Gundogdu.

01:41:37.965 --> 01:41:39.565
And one of them is me.

01:41:41.431 --> 01:41:45.565
I have three Alps
who can take all kinds of risks for you.

01:41:47.365 --> 01:41:48.931
It is no less.

01:41:49.231 --> 01:41:53.131
You saved the nomad tent
from falling apart...

01:41:53.231 --> 01:41:55.565
...and kept it in unity for years.

01:41:57.665 --> 01:42:02.065
Who knows what you will do
with your three Alps, Bey.

01:42:40.298 --> 01:42:43.031
I did so many bad things to you.

01:42:44.231 --> 01:42:47.931
But you should know that
I am not the same person anymore.

01:42:49.631 --> 01:42:52.931
Forgive me
for the bad things I did to you.

01:42:58.531 --> 01:43:01.998
Nobody broke my heart
as much as Turgut did.

01:43:05.898 --> 01:43:08.331
My only worry is Turgut for the moment.

01:43:11.131 --> 01:43:14.165
As for the things you did...

01:43:14.264 --> 01:43:16.264
...may God punish you.

01:43:17.365 --> 01:43:19.665
I am already being punished.

01:43:20.931 --> 01:43:23.598
I paid for all the things I did.

01:43:26.465 --> 01:43:28.898
I just want to have your blessing.

01:43:34.131 --> 01:43:37.898
Give me your blessing before I die.

01:43:45.998 --> 01:43:47.631
You have it.

01:43:57.298 --> 01:43:59.198
You have my blessing.

01:44:07.365 --> 01:44:10.365
I hope my hands
that whipped you get broken.

01:44:11.465 --> 01:44:14.131
I hope my hands get broken.

01:44:26.165 --> 01:44:28.531
Halime...

01:44:28.631 --> 01:44:30.465
Please forgive me.

01:44:31.465 --> 01:44:33.331
Welcome to our nomad tent.

01:44:33.431 --> 01:44:35.631
You are this nomad tent's daughter now.

01:44:35.931 --> 01:44:37.631
We are sister-in-laws now.

01:44:39.598 --> 01:44:41.565
Thank you, Selcan Hatun.

01:44:42.298 --> 01:44:43.898
Thank you.

01:44:44.031 --> 01:44:46.431
I did so many bad things to you, as well.

01:44:46.498 --> 01:44:48.965
I broke your heart so much.

01:44:49.065 --> 01:44:51.198
Give me your blessing.

01:44:51.265 --> 01:44:54.431
I forgot all the disappointments
in my heart.

01:44:56.898 --> 01:45:01.098
You did it because you did not want
the order of the tent be broken.

01:45:01.898 --> 01:45:03.398
Be at ease.

01:45:04.465 --> 01:45:06.398
You have my blessing.

01:45:07.465 --> 01:45:09.265
Thank you.

01:45:36.598 --> 01:45:39.065
My Christian name was Claudius.

01:45:40.165 --> 01:45:45.098
My master Arabi
named me Omer after I became Muslim.

01:45:50.165 --> 01:45:52.598
My master said
"You will be an Alp to Ertugrul...

01:45:52.665 --> 01:45:58.565
...if you want to serve Islam
and be forgiven for your past sins."

01:46:12.565 --> 01:46:14.865
Why did you become a Muslim?

01:46:14.931 --> 01:46:19.331
I was given the duty of
killing Ibn al-Arabi and take the ark.

01:46:22.231 --> 01:46:26.898
When I went there to kill him,
I almost died myself.

01:46:28.098 --> 01:46:32.531
But Hazrat Ibn al-Arabi
helped me even though he knows it.

01:46:34.098 --> 01:46:35.598
And I found health.

01:46:37.265 --> 01:46:40.265
His mercy impressed me a lot.

01:46:42.365 --> 01:46:45.365
God forgive my sins.

01:46:47.031 --> 01:46:48.565
But the Templars...

01:46:49.331 --> 01:46:52.465
...made your Alp Turgut suffer so much.

01:46:57.331 --> 01:47:00.198
I just saw the difference.

01:47:30.298 --> 01:47:33.531
Bey, are we going to believe
what he said?

01:47:41.931 --> 01:47:47.198
What can we do other than believing a man
who brought Arabi's greetings and prayers?

01:47:47.298 --> 01:47:49.398
What if he is lying, Bey?

01:47:49.498 --> 01:47:51.465
He killed so many Alps of ours.

01:47:51.565 --> 01:47:54.865
He said himself
that he had set a trap for Arabi.

01:47:57.198 --> 01:48:02.365
Is it possible for an evil man like this
find the right path just like that?

01:48:04.231 --> 01:48:08.531
We cannot now which dark souls
God's light will enlighten.

01:48:17.398 --> 01:48:19.465
Think about Kurdoglu.

01:48:19.598 --> 01:48:25.931
We would pray
with him together in the nomad tent.

01:48:29.598 --> 01:48:31.331
You are right, Bey.

01:48:37.665 --> 01:48:39.931
Alps!

01:48:39.998 --> 01:48:41.398
Anybody there?

01:48:45.131 --> 01:48:46.398
What is it?

01:48:46.465 --> 01:48:49.198
My father.
Check him out for God's sake.

01:49:04.965 --> 01:49:06.331
Call the midwives.

01:49:42.065 --> 01:49:43.431
Bey...

01:49:43.531 --> 01:49:47.265
I will keep an eye on him anyway.

01:49:49.198 --> 01:49:52.131
Bamsi is right
after all the things Turgut did.

01:49:53.165 --> 01:49:57.865
Bey, do you think we should have killed
Turgut in the first place?

01:49:57.965 --> 01:50:01.098
What if he does anything to them
like this bastard said?

01:50:01.165 --> 01:50:03.865
Do not think bad things like that!

01:50:06.531 --> 01:50:09.298
Let us set off after the meal.

01:50:09.398 --> 01:50:12.031
We must arrive the nomad tent
before sunrise.

01:50:12.131 --> 01:50:13.898
-Yes, Bey.
-Yes, Bey.

01:50:17.265 --> 01:50:18.631
As for Omer...

01:50:19.431 --> 01:50:24.631
...keep an eye on him
until we hear his story from Arabi.

01:50:26.665 --> 01:50:28.565
Be cautious about him.

01:50:32.131 --> 01:50:33.898
What if he is up to something else?

01:50:33.998 --> 01:50:35.365
What do you mean?

01:50:35.465 --> 01:50:37.598
That ark matter.

01:50:37.865 --> 01:50:39.965
What if it is a trick again?

01:51:02.298 --> 01:51:05.098
So, where is the ark, Ertugrul Bey?

01:51:08.331 --> 01:51:12.431
So, you know about the ark like that
jackal whom they call Grandmaster.

01:51:12.565 --> 01:51:17.965
Not only him. Cardinal Thomas
is also after that ark.

01:51:19.865 --> 01:51:22.231
They hate each other.

01:51:23.998 --> 01:51:28.031
But they would do anything for that ark.

01:51:28.165 --> 01:51:30.365
Are they not on the same path?

01:51:31.198 --> 01:51:34.265
The Pope is scared of the Templars' power.

01:51:34.598 --> 01:51:38.631
And the Templars are trying to convince
Emperor Frederick to Crusades...

01:51:38.865 --> 01:51:41.865
...by using the Pope.

01:51:43.998 --> 01:51:46.331
Blood politics, as in everywhere.

01:51:47.965 --> 01:51:53.031
I tempted so many innocent Christians
in this ugly game.

01:51:55.031 --> 01:51:57.998
As many as the
number of Muslims I killed.

01:52:00.631 --> 01:52:06.298
My sheikh show me God's way
to clean myself off the blood in my hands.

01:52:06.565 --> 01:52:09.331
May God protect me from depraving.

01:52:53.298 --> 01:52:54.631
Turgut.

01:52:58.198 --> 01:53:04.065
I should have smashed your head and fed
the birds with it when I first caught you.

01:53:04.665 --> 01:53:08.198
You must be thankful
to my brother Ertugrul.

01:53:08.265 --> 01:53:09.931
Drop the swords.

01:53:30.598 --> 01:53:32.098
Drop the sword.

01:53:37.931 --> 01:53:40.131
It will be a long way tomorrow.

01:53:46.298 --> 01:53:48.931
Are you going to come with us tomorrow?

01:53:50.565 --> 01:53:52.298
Yes.

01:53:53.031 --> 01:53:55.098
We will have a long way.

01:54:38.065 --> 01:54:39.598
Gundogdu!

01:54:40.398 --> 01:54:42.065
Enough!

01:54:45.398 --> 01:54:47.131
It is over.

01:55:04.931 --> 01:55:06.565
So, this is it, Bey.

01:55:06.965 --> 01:55:11.898
We will go for our exile like lambs
who are about to be slaughtered.

01:55:13.931 --> 01:55:16.031
Nothing is over yet, Wild Demir.

01:55:16.965 --> 01:55:20.865
I will not be scared of anything
as long as Ertugrul is out there.

01:55:24.231 --> 01:55:26.331
Put them in the cage.

01:56:14.998 --> 01:56:17.665
My mother. My life.

01:56:18.431 --> 01:56:21.231
My mother
who sacrificed her life for us.

01:56:22.365 --> 01:56:25.398
I was arrogant. I broke hearts.

01:56:26.865 --> 01:56:29.198
I mostly went against you.

01:56:29.265 --> 01:56:30.965
Forgive me.

01:56:37.131 --> 01:56:38.898
My beautiful eyed girl.

01:56:42.965 --> 01:56:45.598
I never had a daughter.

01:56:46.365 --> 01:56:48.665
I always loved you like my daughters.

01:56:49.965 --> 01:56:51.965
I cherished you.

01:56:53.398 --> 01:56:55.298
You have my blessing.

01:56:56.965 --> 01:56:59.065
Do not ever worry.

01:57:00.398 --> 01:57:04.531
Now, be at ease.

01:57:06.198 --> 01:57:08.398
Tomorrow is another day.

01:57:10.131 --> 01:57:13.565
Every dark night has a dawn.

01:57:14.865 --> 01:57:16.498
Hopefully.

02:00:12.031 --> 02:00:13.631
Ertugrul...

02:00:15.365 --> 02:00:17.065
Ertugrul!

02:00:37.465 --> 02:00:39.431
What if they got out, Bey?

02:00:40.665 --> 02:00:42.998
Let us wait for a while, Dogan.

02:00:43.098 --> 02:00:48.065
I will go down the nomad tent
to check it out if nobody comes out.

02:01:26.898 --> 02:01:29.065
I am scared to go to his marquee.

02:01:29.598 --> 02:01:32.198
Do his eyes scare you too, Karabudak?

02:01:34.598 --> 02:01:40.331
His eyes, his words, even his breath.

02:01:44.498 --> 02:01:46.565
What did we do, Kutlu?

02:02:15.231 --> 02:02:17.398
Kurdoglu...

02:02:17.498 --> 02:02:20.098
...you will die in such a way that...

02:02:20.165 --> 02:02:24.431
...the world will be talking about
your carcass, not your throne.

02:02:25.665 --> 02:02:28.065
Take them!

02:02:45.431 --> 02:02:46.865
Get out.

02:03:15.131 --> 02:03:21.398
Kurdoglu is trying to get us out silently
because he is scared of the reactions.

02:03:51.131 --> 02:03:52.931
You rely on the cage.

02:03:54.031 --> 02:03:57.131
Not the cage. I rely on myself.

02:04:10.398 --> 02:04:14.931
You are so brave
while my hands and feet are tied up.

02:04:16.165 --> 02:04:19.665
What was your courage
and mercy good for?

02:04:20.298 --> 02:04:22.631
You lost your throne.

02:04:22.898 --> 02:04:27.265
You will surely pay for this betrayal.

02:04:29.631 --> 02:04:32.431
However, what I wonder is that...

02:04:32.531 --> 02:04:37.998
...while our lifetimes
are coming to an end...

02:04:39.065 --> 02:04:41.365
...why betrayal?

02:04:41.465 --> 02:04:42.931
Why?

02:04:43.565 --> 02:04:45.398
Oh, Suleyman.

02:04:46.631 --> 02:04:48.465
I was braver than you.

02:04:48.565 --> 02:04:50.998
I was more clever than you.

02:04:51.065 --> 02:04:54.098
I worked so hard
for my nomad tent for years.

02:04:54.965 --> 02:04:58.498
I fought a lot
just for you to gain victories.

02:05:00.365 --> 02:05:03.498
Then I thought to myself...

02:05:03.631 --> 02:05:06.265
..."Why is he the Bey, and not me?"

02:05:07.165 --> 02:05:10.598
"Why is he the bey of Kayis,
and not me?"

02:05:12.398 --> 02:05:15.365
But it was me
who did everything, Suleyman.

02:05:16.331 --> 02:05:17.665
It was me.

02:05:17.931 --> 02:05:19.331
Me!

02:05:20.131 --> 02:05:25.865
Kurdoglu, words and weapons
would be no good for you.

02:05:27.531 --> 02:05:31.998
You have the illness of
Adam's son Qabil...

02:05:32.931 --> 02:05:35.031
...who killed his brother.

02:05:36.498 --> 02:05:41.298
Qabil also killed his brother
thinking "Why him, but not me?".

02:05:42.298 --> 02:05:48.931
Do not forget that elder brothers die,
but Qabils die a thousand times.

02:05:50.165 --> 02:05:52.198
Your reign is over, Suleyman.

02:05:52.865 --> 02:05:55.265
You cannot deceive me with these words.

02:06:07.098 --> 02:06:09.065
Alps!

02:06:11.931 --> 02:06:13.465
Take him!

02:07:11.431 --> 02:07:13.565
You know what you have to do, Judas.

02:07:13.665 --> 02:07:15.331
I do, Bey.

02:07:15.931 --> 02:07:17.865
Kill Suleyman the last.

02:07:17.965 --> 02:07:20.931
I want him to witness his family's death.

02:07:23.665 --> 02:07:25.498
Yes, Bey.

02:08:13.165 --> 02:08:15.031
Father!

02:08:23.298 --> 02:08:24.631
Father!

02:08:48.098 --> 02:08:51.298
We will be strong
and give them strength, Bey.

02:09:01.598 --> 02:09:03.998
Hang on, girls.

02:09:04.065 --> 02:09:06.465
You were strong until now.

02:09:06.531 --> 02:09:10.931
Let us leave here
in the way that makes Suleyman Shah proud.

02:09:12.365 --> 02:09:15.298
Ertugrul will come and save us.

02:09:16.631 --> 02:09:20.498
He will never leave us like this,
no matter what.

02:09:27.131 --> 02:09:29.398
Let us stand by our family.

02:09:29.498 --> 02:09:33.465
We have our orders, Bey.
You will not come together on the way.

02:09:41.065 --> 02:09:42.665
My father is coming.

02:10:09.231 --> 02:10:10.898
Is everybody alright?

02:10:11.565 --> 02:10:14.098
We are, Bey. Do not worry.

02:10:15.465 --> 02:10:19.031
We will be better
as long as we have you as our leader.

02:10:32.565 --> 02:10:34.498
Dundar...

02:10:41.365 --> 02:10:43.331
Dundar, son...

02:10:44.198 --> 02:10:45.531
Dundar!

02:10:45.598 --> 02:10:47.365
Let me go! My son...

02:10:47.431 --> 02:10:49.198
Dundar...

02:11:00.198 --> 02:11:02.931
Son... Do not touch me!

02:11:29.065 --> 02:11:31.298
-Is everything ready?
-Everything is ready, Bey.

02:11:31.398 --> 02:11:34.031
Do not show mercy
if anybody causes trouble.

02:11:34.098 --> 02:11:35.665
Yes, Bey.

02:11:53.331 --> 02:11:56.998
Single out Halime Sultan.
She will stay in the nomad tent.

02:11:57.098 --> 02:11:58.265
-No!
-What?

02:11:58.365 --> 02:12:00.031
-No!
-Halime!

02:12:01.898 --> 02:12:03.465
Kurdoglu, what are you doing?

02:12:03.565 --> 02:12:05.531
She is my daughter-in-law.

02:12:08.265 --> 02:12:11.398
The decision was about
you and your family.

02:12:11.465 --> 02:12:14.031
Halime is not family yet.

02:12:14.098 --> 02:12:17.231
Kurdoglu, that is enough already.

02:12:17.865 --> 02:12:21.065
You got what you wanted.
Halime is coming with us.

02:12:22.431 --> 02:12:27.898
Do you not have any amount of
shame, honor and pride, Kurdoglu?

02:12:30.498 --> 02:12:34.398
He will use Sister Halime
to capture Ertugrul.

02:12:34.498 --> 02:12:39.531
You should have used that wit of yours
before setting me traps with your father.

02:12:40.965 --> 02:12:46.131
Kurdoglu, I swear
I will nail your head to my spear...

02:12:46.431 --> 02:12:49.031
...and show it
to everybody in the nomad tent.

02:12:49.098 --> 02:12:51.431
This is a word from Suleyman Shah!

02:12:51.498 --> 02:12:53.631
Pass my greetings to Korkut Bey.

02:12:53.865 --> 02:12:59.031
If he attempts to come at me
with his 300 or 400 Alps...

02:12:59.998 --> 02:13:03.198
...I will deem his nomad tent
a place for booty.

02:13:05.398 --> 02:13:07.398
Take Halime Sultan back.

02:13:08.231 --> 02:13:10.365
Mother!

02:13:10.431 --> 02:13:12.998
Sisters, give me your blessings!

02:13:23.131 --> 02:13:24.598
My girl...

02:13:31.398 --> 02:13:33.898
I will kill you with my own hands.

02:13:33.965 --> 02:13:36.465
I will put your carcass
in the nomad tent square!

02:13:36.564 --> 02:13:38.398
I will kill you, Kurdoglu!

02:13:42.265 --> 02:13:45.265
Alps, may God speed you.

02:13:46.165 --> 02:13:47.564
Move!
