{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

0:01:40.266 --> 0:01:43.400
{\an8}1225 - KAYI TRIBE

0:02:08.900 --> 0:02:12.600
-Great God!
-Only one God!

0:02:13.300 --> 0:02:17.100
-Great God!
-Only one God!

0:02:17.433 --> 0:02:21.066
-Great God!
-Only one God!

0:02:21.400 --> 0:02:24.366
-Great God!
-Only one God!

0:02:29.833 --> 0:02:32.466
Even the iron could not stand
reciting of God and gave in.

0:02:32.866 --> 0:02:33.933
Wait a bit!

0:02:44.833 --> 0:02:46.400
Take a look at this one.

0:02:55.866 --> 0:02:59.500
This is magnificent. I pity the enemy whom
this will be the Azrael of.

0:02:59.833 --> 0:03:01.566
In the hands of a valiant like you...

0:03:01.900 --> 0:03:05.566
...let it be the sound of the oppressed,
wrath to the tyrants, if God permits.

0:03:09.233 --> 0:03:13.400
There’s no sword other than Zulfiqar and
no valiant other than His Holiness Ali.

0:03:13.566 --> 0:03:16.800
I’m ready to sacrifice myself for God,
who gave you to us.

0:03:25.300 --> 0:03:29.333
For the love of God, in the name of my
forefather Oguz, I’ll gird it with honor.

0:03:43.433 --> 0:03:44.900
Bring your hands.

0:03:49.300 --> 0:03:52.566
What is the matter?
Your tumblers are restless again.

0:03:54.500 --> 0:03:56.066
We are going hunting.

0:03:56.433 --> 0:03:58.000
They are getting ready.

0:03:59.966 --> 0:04:02.900
Are there any animals left to hunt
in this famine?

0:04:06.966 --> 0:04:08.433
You are right but...

0:04:09.566 --> 0:04:11.533
...hunting keeps the Alps fit.

0:04:13.300 --> 0:04:16.366
It is better if we find a way to keep
the tribe alive as well.

0:04:17.366 --> 0:04:20.033
That can only be decided
on the headquarters tomorrow.

0:04:20.266 --> 0:04:24.033
If we don’t migrate from this highland
before winter, we would be doomed.

0:04:25.000 --> 0:04:29.000
But if you say that you know a solution,
tell us as well.

0:04:30.933 --> 0:04:33.566
My brother Gundogdu knows
these matters better than me.

0:04:33.866 --> 0:04:35.200
If you wish, talk to him.

0:04:35.400 --> 0:04:36.533
With Gundogdu?

0:04:37.000 --> 0:04:40.933
No, he never breaths a single word about.

0:04:50.900 --> 0:04:53.100
Is this what you bought for 40 coins?

0:04:53.500 --> 0:04:55.300
This is called a map.

0:04:56.466 --> 0:04:58.033
What is it used for?

0:04:58.866 --> 0:05:01.133
Look, we are here.

0:05:01.966 --> 0:05:04.600
Right at where these mountains are.

0:05:05.966 --> 0:05:08.366
This is Aleppo. This is Baghdad.

0:05:09.166 --> 0:05:11.066
And this is Damascus.

0:05:11.300 --> 0:05:14.900
And this is Konya,
where the Sultan’s palace is.

0:05:16.166 --> 0:05:18.933
Let go of the palaces
of the sultans and khans and...

0:05:19.133 --> 0:05:21.933
...tell us where the tribe should
migrate to, Gundogdu.

0:05:22.333 --> 0:05:26.033
The elders are having a dumb moment.
Your father is quiet.

0:05:26.533 --> 0:05:29.566
He just sits in his tent like
a worrier not a warrior.

0:05:38.000 --> 0:05:39.366
Where is this place?

0:05:39.833 --> 0:05:42.133
Everyone will learn tomorrow
at headquarters.

0:05:42.866 --> 0:05:44.300
You found a place, right?

0:05:44.566 --> 0:05:46.400
Please tell me, where is it?

0:06:01.833 --> 0:06:03.033
Ertugrul!

0:06:04.900 --> 0:06:06.133
Ertugrul!

0:06:07.900 --> 0:06:09.166
Where are you going?

0:06:09.466 --> 0:06:11.133
I am going hunting, brother.

0:06:11.266 --> 0:06:14.166
This is not the time to go hunting.
We have headquarters tomorrow.

0:06:14.333 --> 0:06:16.833
The headquarter is yours
and hunt is mine, brother.

0:06:17.066 --> 0:06:20.966
Alright. But don’t go too far.
Go quickly, come back quickly.

0:06:39.333 --> 0:06:43.000
What are you doing with that meat?
We are going hunting, did you forget?

0:06:43.333 --> 0:06:46.000
We won’t let you starve during a hunt,
don’t you worry.

0:06:46.133 --> 0:06:48.600
How can you call a valiant as valiant if
he starves while he is hunting, Turgut?

0:06:48.966 --> 0:06:53.366
-This is just for the road.
-It is impossible to relieve your hunger.

0:06:56.333 --> 0:06:57.866
Come on, Alps.

0:06:59.600 --> 0:07:00.933
Your man is going.

0:07:36.966 --> 0:07:40.166
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS CASTLE

0:08:43.933 --> 0:08:46.833
Guard duty is your pride!

0:08:47.800 --> 0:08:50.033
Guard duty is your honor!

0:08:52.266 --> 0:08:55.400
If you betray your pride and honor...

0:08:55.600 --> 0:08:59.200
...your death will not come
from the enemy, but from me!

0:09:50.133 --> 0:09:52.033
You have honored us, Ustad-i Azam.

0:09:52.266 --> 0:09:54.066
That honor belongs to us.

0:09:59.800 --> 0:10:02.166
-Elanora.
-Commander Titus.

0:10:02.866 --> 0:10:04.433
I hope your journey was fine.

0:10:04.566 --> 0:10:06.333
Is everything alright, Titus?

0:10:07.866 --> 0:10:09.866
We are safer than ever, sir.

0:10:16.100 --> 0:10:19.566
Your chambers are ready, sir.
Would you like to rest before lunch?

0:10:19.900 --> 0:10:22.033
Elanora may rest. We have work to do.

0:10:23.200 --> 0:10:25.566
-As you wish.
-With your permission.

0:10:49.933 --> 0:10:52.366
What is the latest development
about the prisoners?

0:10:52.833 --> 0:10:54.900
I gave that duty to my brother Bisol.

0:10:57.933 --> 0:11:00.533
They will submit Numan and his family
to Karatoygar.

0:11:03.133 --> 0:11:04.933
For the others, I waited for you.

0:11:05.366 --> 0:11:06.400
Good.

0:11:33.400 --> 0:11:35.200
Where are they taking us, father?

0:11:38.966 --> 0:11:40.233
To our palace, son.

0:11:43.333 --> 0:11:45.300
We will be free there, right?

0:11:46.233 --> 0:11:47.600
Until eternity, son.

0:11:48.300 --> 0:11:49.466
Until eternity.

0:11:57.966 --> 0:12:00.300
So out fate was to return to Konya
like this.

0:12:01.266 --> 0:12:05.033
To the palace we were born in and
grew up, to be killed by our uncle.

0:12:05.200 --> 0:12:08.833
I will not let anything to happen
to you or your brother, my daughter.

0:12:30.066 --> 0:12:33.966
This way Karatoygar will be
dependent on us more than ever.

0:12:35.166 --> 0:12:38.800
It is very important for him to win
the favor of Sultan Aladdin.

0:12:39.400 --> 0:12:44.500
Karatoygar becoming a high officer
in the Seljuk court will relieve us.

0:12:46.500 --> 0:12:48.233
{\an8}KARATOYGAR INN

0:12:48.433 --> 0:12:50.433
{\an8}-We did everything as you ordered, sir.
-Okay!

0:12:52.033 --> 0:12:53.200
Head of guard!

0:12:54.933 --> 0:12:57.800
Are the Turkmen tribes paying
their taxes?

0:12:58.100 --> 0:13:01.166
We can’t control them, sir.
They are always on the move.

0:13:01.566 --> 0:13:04.166
-Which one is the biggest tribe?
-Kayi tribe, sir.

0:13:04.600 --> 0:13:06.566
They ran away from the Mongol invasion.

0:13:06.866 --> 0:13:08.933
-Who is their leader?
-Suleyman Shah.

0:13:09.233 --> 0:13:12.566
-How many tents?
-2000 tents. But they are well respected.

0:13:12.966 --> 0:13:15.166
-Do they pay their taxes?
-They do, sir.

0:13:16.333 --> 0:13:17.433
Good.

0:13:18.233 --> 0:13:21.366
Then, they shall pay their taxes
earlier this year.

0:13:22.233 --> 0:13:25.233
-But, sir...
-You heard what I said.

0:13:25.833 --> 0:13:27.866
How will this state remain standing?

0:13:28.000 --> 0:13:30.500
Inform all the tribes
in the region immediately.

0:13:30.800 --> 0:13:31.900
Yes, sir.

0:13:34.866 --> 0:13:36.266
Where are those templars?

0:13:43.800 --> 0:13:44.833
Halt!

0:13:46.500 --> 0:13:48.033
Let us rest a bit here.

0:13:50.466 --> 0:13:51.966
Check the surroundings.

0:14:03.966 --> 0:14:07.300
We need to weaken the Seljuks
before the crusade.

0:14:08.533 --> 0:14:12.133
You should put more men
in the Seljuk court, Titus.

0:14:17.133 --> 0:14:20.233
Please be rest assured that
we will possess the whole court.

0:14:20.466 --> 0:14:24.400
There is a group in the Papacy,
who are reluctant about the crusade.

0:14:26.533 --> 0:14:27.966
I am not surprised.

0:14:29.133 --> 0:14:32.166
We need to make a plan that will mobilize
the whole Europe.

0:14:32.433 --> 0:14:34.000
We need to do this.

0:14:34.800 --> 0:14:38.400
The Christian world should unite
and act for Jerusalem.

0:14:38.966 --> 0:14:43.133
For this, we need to provoke
the Muslims and make them attack us.

0:14:44.233 --> 0:14:46.466
I have some very valuable prisoners.

0:14:46.833 --> 0:14:48.200
We can start with them.

0:14:54.566 --> 0:14:56.000
Calm down, son.

0:14:57.166 --> 0:14:58.266
Yigit.

0:15:00.833 --> 0:15:02.000
Commoner...

0:15:02.366 --> 0:15:03.966
...you can go to hell.

0:15:05.100 --> 0:15:08.800
-Take us to our destination quickly.
-So you are very keen to die.

0:15:10.366 --> 0:15:13.533
I pity for your beautiful daughter
and your small Shahzade.

0:15:15.900 --> 0:15:17.366
Don’t shed a tear for us.

0:15:17.833 --> 0:15:21.800
If you had accepted to be allies with us,
you were to become the Seljuk sultan...

0:15:22.000 --> 0:15:25.533
...and everything was going to be fine.
-You offered slavery for the Pope.

0:15:25.833 --> 0:15:27.933
We offered you peace...

0:15:28.466 --> 0:15:30.366
...and a new world order.

0:15:31.100 --> 0:15:33.000
We wanted to live side by side.

0:15:33.133 --> 0:15:34.333
But...

0:15:35.933 --> 0:15:38.133
...the Muslim blood will always be shed.

0:15:38.533 --> 0:15:40.433
There is no escape from this.

0:15:40.833 --> 0:15:45.966
And we will shed your blood with
the Muslim allies we have.

0:15:47.533 --> 0:15:49.100
You will not succeed.

0:15:49.800 --> 0:15:51.166
We will see.

0:15:51.533 --> 0:15:53.233
In the mean time...

0:15:53.366 --> 0:15:55.600
...to all your men I had sent to hell...

0:15:56.300 --> 0:15:58.166
...give them my regards.

0:15:58.433 --> 0:16:00.433
-The area is safe, sir.
-Good.

0:16:01.133 --> 0:16:02.333
Water the horses.

0:16:03.566 --> 0:16:04.900
These too.

0:16:13.600 --> 0:16:16.200
-Come on!
-Yeah!

0:16:16.566 --> 0:16:17.933
Come on!

0:16:28.966 --> 0:16:31.233
You two, go and sit somewhere else.

0:16:51.600 --> 0:16:53.500
I brought you water. Take it.

0:16:54.566 --> 0:16:55.866
Take it.

0:17:06.566 --> 0:17:07.600
Come on.

0:17:29.500 --> 0:17:30.966
They are not aware.

0:17:31.166 --> 0:17:32.566
Key! Take the key.

0:17:50.333 --> 0:17:51.566
Come on, my girl.

0:18:07.533 --> 0:18:09.000
We are in luck.

0:18:35.033 --> 0:18:36.800
The prisoners are running away!

0:18:36.933 --> 0:18:38.966
-Quick, run!
-Get them!

0:19:39.233 --> 0:19:41.066
-Father!
-Father!

0:19:41.466 --> 0:19:43.533
-Are you alright?
-Father!

0:19:44.933 --> 0:19:47.133
Quick, take your brother
and get out of here.

0:19:47.266 --> 0:19:48.433
No!

0:20:15.033 --> 0:20:17.000
-Father!
-Father!

0:20:17.366 --> 0:20:21.366
-Quick! Run away!
-No, we cannot leave you in this state.

0:20:22.366 --> 0:20:25.100
Take your brother and
get the hell out of here!

0:20:44.100 --> 0:20:46.200
Come on, father! Get up! Come on!

0:20:54.033 --> 0:20:56.400
So you tried to run away!
You will pay for this.

0:21:06.166 --> 0:21:07.166
Father!

0:21:09.600 --> 0:21:10.900
Father!

0:21:11.266 --> 0:21:14.333
Have some decency! Dear God!
Have some decency!

0:21:30.600 --> 0:21:32.000
Great God!

0:22:05.133 --> 0:22:06.566
-Father!
-Father!

0:22:56.266 --> 0:22:58.233
Father, stay with us, please!

0:25:55.300 --> 0:25:57.266
Your first victim was a crusader.

0:25:57.933 --> 0:26:00.600
-Stay with us.
-Be strong, father.

0:26:05.466 --> 0:26:07.966
-Quick, bring some oak leaves.
-Okay.

0:26:15.133 --> 0:26:19.100
If we are successful, all the borders
in the region will change.

0:26:20.466 --> 0:26:25.533
We should not refrain from using
our order’s wealth to save Jerusalem.

0:26:26.366 --> 0:26:29.166
We are ready to spend the whole treasury.

0:26:30.566 --> 0:26:35.966
For young men, a new Jerusalem campaign
would be the shortest road to riches.

0:26:37.100 --> 0:26:41.933
They will be enlisting by the thousands
to be a member of the crusade army.

0:26:43.966 --> 0:26:47.900
The Catalans, the Venetians,
the Marseilleans...

0:26:48.866 --> 0:26:51.966
...they will be pining for this carnival.

0:26:54.400 --> 0:26:55.900
Well...

0:26:56.300 --> 0:27:01.066
...what about the spoilt princes of
Europe, how will we trust them?

0:27:02.933 --> 0:27:05.866
When the Muslims start to fight
with each other...

0:27:06.066 --> 0:27:08.433
...our job will not be difficult, Titus.

0:27:08.600 --> 0:27:10.400
What about the Seljuks, sir?

0:27:11.966 --> 0:27:13.400
Anatolia.

0:27:13.966 --> 0:27:17.500
They are on the peak of their power
with Sultan Aladdin.

0:27:19.066 --> 0:27:24.000
When we make the Turks and the grandsons
of Saladin Ayyubi fall out on...

0:27:24.133 --> 0:27:27.200
...each other we will reach our goal.

0:27:33.466 --> 0:27:35.266
Jerusalem will be ours.

0:27:56.533 --> 0:27:58.500
Father, please be strong.

0:28:21.133 --> 0:28:22.800
We have to go immediately.

0:28:24.900 --> 0:28:26.066
You can go.

0:28:26.833 --> 0:28:28.566
We can look after ourselves.

0:28:29.000 --> 0:28:30.500
It will get dark soon.

0:28:31.300 --> 0:28:34.033
The jackals would have
already smelled the blood.

0:28:34.466 --> 0:28:37.600
-We should go.
-Dogan, bring the horses.

0:28:44.966 --> 0:28:47.966
It is easy to fend off a crusader brigade.
What about this?

0:28:48.100 --> 0:28:49.400
Ertugrul is lost now.

0:28:49.533 --> 0:28:53.366
-God always helps those who get lost.
-He is lost real bad now.

0:28:53.533 --> 0:28:54.866
Come on.

0:28:57.500 --> 0:29:00.600
-What can you do alone as a woman?
-I said we won’t go.

0:29:04.366 --> 0:29:07.566
We owe you a life.
We will pay our debt one day.

0:29:08.266 --> 0:29:09.833
Tell us your name.

0:29:10.033 --> 0:29:11.800
Ertugrul from Kayi tribe.

0:29:13.466 --> 0:29:14.966
As you wish.

0:29:15.466 --> 0:29:18.100
May God be with you. I wish you good luck.

0:29:20.500 --> 0:29:22.066
We should go with them.

0:29:23.200 --> 0:29:24.333
Is your tribe far?

0:30:06.433 --> 0:30:09.366
Even our money for bad days is finished,
Brother Afsin.

0:30:09.533 --> 0:30:13.933
We can set shop here. If we see that
they are not interested, we can go on.

0:30:15.100 --> 0:30:18.500
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you. Welcome.

0:30:39.933 --> 0:30:41.500
Welcome, Gazanfar Aga.

0:30:41.966 --> 0:30:43.866
You bring joy to Kayi tribe.

0:30:44.333 --> 0:30:48.100
Kurdoglu, my brother. You always
look very healthy, thanks to God.

0:30:48.333 --> 0:30:52.033
Would these moorlands keep a man healthy,
for us to be healthy, Gazanfer?

0:30:52.200 --> 0:30:54.533
No, don’t say that. You look very well.

0:30:55.800 --> 0:30:57.133
Where is your caravan?

0:30:57.366 --> 0:30:59.466
The caravan is near the black rock.

0:30:59.800 --> 0:31:03.933
I came to get permission from Suleyman
Shah to set up a stall in the market.

0:31:04.400 --> 0:31:05.533
How is business?

0:31:05.900 --> 0:31:07.433
We thank God on what he gives.

0:31:07.600 --> 0:31:11.333
I wanted to come to Kayi to supply
whatever they need before the journey.

0:31:11.466 --> 0:31:14.900
Thank you, Gazanfer. I hope you meet
your expectations, if God permits.

0:31:15.033 --> 0:31:16.100
Thank you.

0:31:16.533 --> 0:31:19.366
If Suleyman Shah is available,
I would like to meet him.

0:31:20.833 --> 0:31:23.100
Tell our Bey that Gazanfer Aga is here.

0:31:43.566 --> 0:31:46.566
-How much is this?
-He is a mute, sir. Let me help you.

0:31:48.266 --> 0:31:49.400
80 coins.

0:31:52.533 --> 0:31:54.266
You look familiar to me.

0:31:54.500 --> 0:31:56.900
This is my first time in your tribe, sir.

0:31:57.100 --> 0:31:59.200
You probably took me for someone else.

0:32:16.600 --> 0:32:18.800
Peace be upon you, Suleyman Shah.

0:32:20.500 --> 0:32:23.433
And peace be upon you, trader. Welcome.

0:32:24.266 --> 0:32:26.333
You bring joy to us. Come and sit.

0:32:30.866 --> 0:32:35.833
Suleyman Bey, my eyes are so happy that
they had the chance to see you again.

0:32:36.400 --> 0:32:40.933
Please accept my presents. I brought them
from Constantinople for you.

0:32:43.266 --> 0:32:44.933
You did not have to bother.

0:32:47.166 --> 0:32:51.366
-Kurdoglu, give these to those in need.
-As you wish, Bey.

0:32:52.233 --> 0:32:53.366
Well?

0:32:54.300 --> 0:32:57.533
Tell us now. What did those eyes see in
other parts of the world?

0:32:57.900 --> 0:32:59.900
I wish I was deaf and not hear it.

0:33:00.066 --> 0:33:02.500
I wish I was blind and not see it, Bey.

0:33:02.900 --> 0:33:04.133
What happened?

0:33:06.400 --> 0:33:09.233
Sultan Aladdin controlled Konya but...

0:33:09.433 --> 0:33:12.500
...he worries that the fugitive Shahzades
may give him trouble.

0:33:12.833 --> 0:33:14.933
The Latins ransacked Constantinople.

0:33:15.100 --> 0:33:16.966
All Orthodox people left the city.

0:33:17.133 --> 0:33:18.866
There is no order, no peace...

0:33:19.033 --> 0:33:21.966
...and with the famine now,
everyone is desperate.

0:33:22.166 --> 0:33:25.933
We heard that the leftovers from
the crusaders were getting restless.

0:33:26.500 --> 0:33:29.266
It is obvious that they are up to
something once again.

0:33:29.433 --> 0:33:30.800
Well...

0:33:31.000 --> 0:33:32.966
...how are the common people?

0:33:33.166 --> 0:33:36.400
They will be on the road again
to find something to eat.

0:33:36.533 --> 0:33:41.000
The rumor is that the Pope is calling for
a new crusade to the European princes.

0:33:42.933 --> 0:33:45.600
And we Muslims fight against each other.

0:33:45.966 --> 0:33:50.000
Sowing discord between us,
fueling the disorder as much as possible.

0:33:51.366 --> 0:33:54.266
From Anatolia to Basra,
everywhere is on fire.

0:33:54.466 --> 0:33:56.366
This fire will hit us as well, Bey.

0:33:56.500 --> 0:33:58.833
Please don’t say fire, it upsets me, Bey.

0:33:58.966 --> 0:34:02.400
I came to seek for permission to sell
my goods in your tribe.

0:34:03.033 --> 0:34:05.499
-You have our permission.
-Thank you.

0:34:15.400 --> 0:34:19.800
Karatoygar has come to the region
to control the Turkmen tribes.

0:34:20.200 --> 0:34:22.300
So difficult times await us.

0:34:29.366 --> 0:34:32.966
And this girl is from Venetia.
Rosalina, she has noble blood.

0:34:33.166 --> 0:34:36.833
A white skin, green eyes.
A rare find, commander.

0:34:37.166 --> 0:34:40.366
And she is very cheap as well.
I am in urgent need of money.

0:34:40.533 --> 0:34:43.366
This is a very good opportunity
for you and me.

0:34:48.066 --> 0:34:49.966
What do you say to this, commander?

0:34:50.133 --> 0:34:52.233
They kidnapped her from
the Greek Islands.

0:34:52.366 --> 0:34:54.133
She screams beauty and freshness.

0:34:54.300 --> 0:34:55.800
She is a wild one.

0:34:56.166 --> 0:34:59.800
I personally trained her.
For a master with good taste.

0:35:00.033 --> 0:35:01.833
What about that blond one?

0:35:03.933 --> 0:35:06.100
I must say that you have good taste.

0:35:06.366 --> 0:35:10.133
I bought her from the crusader discards.
They brought her in with a ship.

0:35:10.300 --> 0:35:12.800
She is Serbian,
she knows how to treat a man.

0:35:12.933 --> 0:35:13.966
Enough.

0:35:14.600 --> 0:35:15.900
Come here.

0:35:32.166 --> 0:35:34.400
You don’t need to be afraid of me.

0:35:38.266 --> 0:35:40.000
I am your master now.

0:35:43.166 --> 0:35:46.466
You chose the most expensive one,
commander. But she is worth it.

0:35:55.266 --> 0:35:57.066
-Sir?
-What happened?

0:35:57.566 --> 0:36:00.500
The crusaders. They were ambushed.

0:36:02.433 --> 0:36:04.833
Didn’t you save them?

0:36:06.000 --> 0:36:07.366
We were too late.

0:36:07.500 --> 0:36:09.400
So you were late.

0:36:57.333 --> 0:36:58.866
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

0:37:06.900 --> 0:37:08.933
-Come on, help them.
-Help them.

0:37:09.066 --> 0:37:10.966
Akcakoca, we have a wounded man.

0:37:11.566 --> 0:37:13.900
-Come on.
-Bamsi, take him in.

0:37:25.500 --> 0:37:28.100
-What happened?
-Nothing to worry about.

0:37:28.300 --> 0:37:31.366
-You are alright, yes?
-We all are, thank God.

0:37:46.366 --> 0:37:47.600
Ertugrul...

0:37:48.166 --> 0:37:49.600
...what happened, my brother?

0:37:51.466 --> 0:37:54.200
They were attacked, brother.
I will tell you later.

0:38:06.966 --> 0:38:09.266
-Look after them, Ramazan.
-As you wish, Bey.

0:38:14.566 --> 0:38:16.166
Who are they, Gundogdu?

0:38:16.333 --> 0:38:20.066
I don’t know. He will tell us later.
We will find out soon.

0:38:28.966 --> 0:38:31.300
Sister, what is happening? Who are they?

0:38:32.200 --> 0:38:34.900
We will find out soon. We will see.

0:38:39.533 --> 0:38:43.366
The sword hit him right below the rib.
Fortunately the oak leaves stopped...

0:38:43.533 --> 0:38:46.433
...the bleeding,
otherwise we would have lost him.

0:38:48.066 --> 0:38:50.900
-Midwife, bring hot water.
-At once, Akcakoca.

0:38:54.366 --> 0:38:58.133
The leg is bad as well.
But we should fix this wound first.

0:38:59.233 --> 0:39:02.466
Akcakoca can take it from here.
Let us wait at the side.

0:39:03.433 --> 0:39:06.333
-We cannot leave our father alone, sister.
-Don’t worry.

0:39:06.933 --> 0:39:08.400
Your father is in good hands.

0:39:28.366 --> 0:39:31.266
Thank you very much. You are God sent.

0:39:32.400 --> 0:39:34.866
-We brought trouble to you.
-Don’t say that.

0:39:35.933 --> 0:39:39.066
You had more breaths to take,
more bites to eat.

0:39:43.133 --> 0:39:45.166
Where were the crusaders taking you?

0:39:50.333 --> 0:39:52.566
I don’t know. They didn’t say.

0:39:55.933 --> 0:39:59.933
I guess they were going to sell us in
the slave market. My father is a trader.

0:40:00.100 --> 0:40:02.166
We were captured in the Mediterranean.

0:40:10.933 --> 0:40:14.500
Your father must be a good trader.
Having so many crusaders taking you.

0:40:15.466 --> 0:40:16.566
Yes.

0:40:18.033 --> 0:40:19.300
We were rich.

0:40:19.800 --> 0:40:21.866
But we don’t have anything left now.

0:40:24.900 --> 0:40:26.133
Well...

0:40:26.566 --> 0:40:28.133
...which tribe is this?

0:40:29.833 --> 0:40:31.300
You are in Kayi tribe.

0:40:31.533 --> 0:40:34.166
I am the son of
the tribe Bey, Suleyman Shah.

0:40:34.433 --> 0:40:36.166
We owe you three lives.

0:40:44.566 --> 0:40:48.000
-Do you want to be freed from slavery?
-Yes.

0:40:49.966 --> 0:40:52.133
-Then, kill this man.
-No!

0:40:52.866 --> 0:40:54.900
I will buy and then free you.

0:40:55.033 --> 0:40:57.233
Commander, you are furious.
First calm down...

0:40:57.366 --> 0:40:58.500
Shut your mouth.

0:40:58.933 --> 0:41:00.800
Don’t let me kill you as well.

0:41:01.433 --> 0:41:03.800
Sir, please spare me for my children.

0:41:03.933 --> 0:41:05.500
You are good for nothing.

0:41:07.566 --> 0:41:08.866
Do it!

0:41:09.200 --> 0:41:11.500
-I can’t.
-I said do it!

0:42:03.533 --> 0:42:05.166
I’m freeing you!

0:42:13.833 --> 0:42:17.933
A slave that can kill someone
to be free...

0:42:19.200 --> 0:42:22.400
...can kill her master one day as well.

0:42:25.266 --> 0:42:26.966
Get ready, we are going!

0:42:26.991 --> 0:42:27.391


0:42:48.666 --> 0:42:51.266
Bey, dinner is ready. Come to the table.

0:43:05.936 --> 0:43:08.770
Dundar, come on, come to the table, son.

0:43:09.036 --> 0:43:11.370
I will come as soon as
I finish this, mother.

0:43:11.936 --> 0:43:16.836
Always be like that, my boy.
Finish the job at hand first.

0:43:17.270 --> 0:43:18.803
-Selcan?
-Yes, mother?

0:43:18.970 --> 0:43:20.970
-Bring the molasses, my girl.
-Yes, mother.

0:43:21.103 --> 0:43:22.303
Where is Gundogdu?

0:43:22.503 --> 0:43:25.570
He went to check the shepherds,
he will come in a few minutes.

0:43:31.436 --> 0:43:34.936
Put another plate on the table.
For Sungurtekin.

0:43:36.536 --> 0:43:40.370
If he comes back one day, he should know
that his place is ready at the table.

0:43:41.836 --> 0:43:45.370
Come on then. Why is Gundogdu late?

0:43:46.036 --> 0:43:47.403
He will come, mother.

0:44:03.136 --> 0:44:04.570
In the name of God.

0:44:17.303 --> 0:44:20.470
Well, son? You returned with a big hunt.

0:44:21.503 --> 0:44:23.070
Something like that, Bey.

0:44:23.236 --> 0:44:27.370
What kind of luck is this, brother?
You are like a lightning pulling tree.

0:44:27.870 --> 0:44:30.303
You attract all kinds of trouble
to yourself.

0:44:36.570 --> 0:44:40.770
The innocents were under attack.
We did what we could do.

0:44:41.203 --> 0:44:43.370
Who are they? Where do they come from?

0:44:44.003 --> 0:44:47.370
They were captured by the crusaders.
The man is a trader.

0:44:48.003 --> 0:44:50.470
The crusaders must be from
Antioch Countship.

0:44:50.803 --> 0:44:55.103
Knights don’t freely transport captives
in the Seljuk territory.

0:44:55.570 --> 0:44:56.770
Well?

0:44:56.936 --> 0:45:00.970
What I mean is, the Seljuks must
know about these prisoners.

0:45:01.403 --> 0:45:03.570
There were no Seljuk soldiers with them.

0:45:04.036 --> 0:45:07.770
Sooner or later, the kind of trouble
you called will be revealed, Ertugrul.

0:45:09.503 --> 0:45:12.870
What should have I done, brother?
Turn my back and leave?

0:45:13.070 --> 0:45:17.036
Both of you stop talking.
Host them in a way worthy of our tribe.

0:45:17.903 --> 0:45:20.003
We will see what the future holds.

0:45:40.336 --> 0:45:44.270
It is over, father. You are saved.
You will be healed.

0:45:49.103 --> 0:45:51.770
-Do we have permission?
-Come in, Bey.

0:46:00.970 --> 0:46:02.036
How is he?

0:46:02.470 --> 0:46:04.803
It is up to God from now on.

0:46:10.170 --> 0:46:11.470
With your permission.

0:46:25.570 --> 0:46:26.970
Come in, Aykiz.

0:46:30.936 --> 0:46:32.136
Aykiz.

0:46:33.003 --> 0:46:34.436
Turgut’s sweetheart.

0:46:38.570 --> 0:46:41.203
I wanted to ask whether
you need anything or not.

0:46:42.236 --> 0:46:43.303
Thank you.

0:46:45.236 --> 0:46:48.103
-We have been a big burden on you.
-Don’t say that.

0:46:49.103 --> 0:46:53.570
Bamsi Beyrek and Dogan are preparing their
tent for you, you can stay there tonight.

0:46:58.036 --> 0:46:59.303
I...

0:46:59.536 --> 0:47:01.470
...should stay with my father.

0:47:03.403 --> 0:47:06.370
Rest a bit tonight. You look very tired.

0:47:07.036 --> 0:47:09.936
Your father will need you more
when he wakes up tomorrow.

0:47:10.070 --> 0:47:12.236
Don’t worry, I will stay with your father.

0:47:33.836 --> 0:47:38.170
Bey, how did you let the boil get so big?

0:47:40.336 --> 0:47:43.170
We carry so many problems
on our backs, Hayme.

0:47:43.770 --> 0:47:46.103
Will we be afraid of one this small?

0:47:46.836 --> 0:47:51.270
If you had crushed its head when it was
small, it would have been long gone.

0:47:51.770 --> 0:47:55.870
The jackals used to live in the mountains,
now they are inside our tribe.

0:47:56.036 --> 0:47:59.003
They wait for my slightest
mistake to attack.

0:47:59.270 --> 0:48:02.136
I hide it so that they don’t know
about my weakness.

0:48:02.303 --> 0:48:05.136
It is better to bite your lip
and sit with pain...

0:48:05.270 --> 0:48:08.036
...rather than giving them
something to talk about.

0:48:08.536 --> 0:48:10.870
At least, you should have told Akcakoca.

0:48:11.103 --> 0:48:15.070
I did, woman, I did.
He is preparing an ointment to cure me.

0:48:15.970 --> 0:48:18.170
We will put in on at night,
if God permits.

0:48:23.836 --> 0:48:26.536
What happened?
Are you thinking about our guests?

0:48:27.836 --> 0:48:31.203
I don’t know what kind of
a smoky candle this wick has lit.

0:51:30.536 --> 0:51:32.170
-Did you wear it?
-Yes.

0:51:32.570 --> 0:51:34.903
-How is it?
-It is beautiful, Aykiz.

0:51:37.936 --> 0:51:39.136
Let me see.

0:51:40.903 --> 0:51:44.903
Dear God. You look like a queen
from a palace, Halime.

0:51:46.836 --> 0:51:48.336
You look so beautiful.

0:51:50.336 --> 0:51:53.336
What happened? Did I say something wrong?

0:51:54.403 --> 0:51:57.536
No. I just found it strange
for you to say that.

0:51:59.903 --> 0:52:02.070
Wait, let us put the head piece as well.

0:52:09.936 --> 0:52:11.570
Turgut Alp got this for me.

0:52:12.336 --> 0:52:14.936
Dear God! Why did you give it to me then?

0:52:15.870 --> 0:52:19.070
Because I knew that it would suit you.
Let me see?

0:52:20.003 --> 0:52:21.303
I was right.

0:52:22.403 --> 0:52:23.970
When is your wedding?

0:52:25.136 --> 0:52:28.003
After we migrate from this moorland,
if God permits.

0:52:30.303 --> 0:52:33.270
Isn’t it very hard to be
the wife of an Alp?

0:52:34.236 --> 0:52:38.003
If his heart is beating for me,
who cares how hard it is?

0:52:38.170 --> 0:52:41.336
The only thing I want is for him
to be back safe and sound.

0:52:41.836 --> 0:52:43.570
As long as there is no death.

0:52:45.903 --> 0:52:48.903
-Shall we braid your hair, if you want?
-Alright.

0:52:53.170 --> 0:52:54.770
Do you have a man in your life?

0:52:58.770 --> 0:53:02.936
After my mother died, the only thing
that was in my life was being a mother...

0:53:03.103 --> 0:53:06.070
...to my brother Yigit and
be a companion to my father.

0:53:07.136 --> 0:53:11.170
-Anyway, which man would want...
-Are you out of your mind?

0:53:11.970 --> 0:53:15.936
Men would fight, they would turn
the world upside down for you.

0:53:18.070 --> 0:53:21.070
When was the last time
you looked at yourself in a mirror?

0:53:21.503 --> 0:53:22.503
Wait.

0:53:54.936 --> 0:53:57.403
Isn't he the brother of
the infidel called Titus?

0:53:57.536 --> 0:53:59.303
Yes, sir. Bisol.

0:53:59.836 --> 0:54:02.036
Send these bodies to the Templars.

0:54:02.436 --> 0:54:04.903
We will be dealing with Titus as well now.

0:54:05.903 --> 0:54:08.036
You! You! Come here!

0:54:10.036 --> 0:54:11.503
Load this one on a horse.

0:54:11.970 --> 0:54:14.936
-Which tribe does this seal belong to?
-Kayi tribe, sir.

0:54:15.203 --> 0:54:16.770
So they are Kayis.

0:54:20.203 --> 0:54:23.036
If they are with Suleyman Shah,
our job is very difficult.

0:54:23.170 --> 0:54:25.803
Could that shepherd head
resist the Seljuk?

0:54:37.070 --> 0:54:40.103
-May you have a good morning, Ertugrul.
-You too.

0:54:41.136 --> 0:54:42.570
I brought you some food.

0:54:44.936 --> 0:54:47.070
You did not need to bother, Gokce Baci.

0:54:49.036 --> 0:54:53.003
-How is our wounded guest?
-Fine. He should be up in a few days.

0:54:53.503 --> 0:54:57.970
If God permits. May God give him health
and hope he does not bring any trouble.

0:55:03.870 --> 0:55:06.336
I will be back in a while and
we can go to the weaving area.

0:55:06.470 --> 0:55:07.470
Alright, Aykiz.

0:55:12.403 --> 0:55:14.136
Is my father better, Ertugrul Bey?

0:55:14.270 --> 0:55:16.103
Yes, much better.

0:55:16.336 --> 0:55:18.070
You will see when you go in.

0:55:18.203 --> 0:55:21.903
His fever has gone down. We can take him
to your tent tonight, if God permits.

0:55:34.770 --> 0:55:36.003
Did you see the girl?

0:55:36.170 --> 0:55:38.403
She already has Ertugrul
eating from her hands.

0:55:38.570 --> 0:55:41.036
You can only see him
in your dreams from now on.

0:55:52.503 --> 0:55:53.870
Did you sleep well?

0:55:55.536 --> 0:55:58.036
It has been years since
I slept so peacefully.

0:56:07.770 --> 0:56:09.436
In the forest you said Templars.

0:56:11.970 --> 0:56:12.970
Yes.

0:56:13.370 --> 0:56:14.503
Who are they?

0:56:23.103 --> 0:56:25.170
An order that fights for Jerusalem.

0:56:26.403 --> 0:56:28.470
They are very strong and ruthless.

0:56:29.070 --> 0:56:31.870
Their only aim is to take revenge
on Jerusalem.

0:56:32.103 --> 0:56:34.936
If they are so strong,
what did they want from you?

0:56:40.903 --> 0:56:43.170
-Is this the Seljuk territory?
-Yes.

0:56:48.470 --> 0:56:51.170
Do you have an issue
with the Seljuks, Halime?

0:56:52.103 --> 0:56:56.203
Not at all. What issue can
the great Seljuks have with us?

0:57:17.303 --> 0:57:18.336
Towel.

0:57:21.570 --> 0:57:25.036
-What is wrong with you, my girl?
-Nothing, father. I didn’t see it.

0:57:29.270 --> 0:57:33.970
But you can still say
what you want to say, right?

0:57:35.103 --> 0:57:39.236
A thing cannot become reality just because
you want it very much. I learned this.

0:57:39.536 --> 0:57:40.903
From whom?

0:57:44.070 --> 0:57:48.470
We were going to get married with Turgut
after the migration, we yearned for it.

0:57:49.836 --> 0:57:54.170
The winter is knocking at our door and
we still don’t know where we will go to.

0:57:54.869 --> 0:57:58.503
I understand.
You are as impatient as your late mother.

0:57:59.436 --> 0:58:03.570
Take a look around you. Can we survive
the winter on a mountain this high?

0:58:04.870 --> 0:58:09.103
Why do you think we have headquarters?
Why do all the neighboring Beys come to...

0:58:09.270 --> 0:58:11.303
...our Suleyman Shah’s marquee?

0:58:11.836 --> 0:58:16.236
We will sit, we will talk and
we will solve this matter, if God permits.

0:58:16.503 --> 0:58:19.370
Don’t you worry about it.
We should not be late.

0:58:24.370 --> 0:58:26.303
My dear sweet girl, Aykiz.

0:58:28.436 --> 0:58:32.336
They will be gathering for headquarters,
Kurdoglu. Nobody knows what to do.

0:58:32.536 --> 0:58:34.503
We will get over this, with God’s help.

0:58:34.803 --> 0:58:37.970
Kurdoglu, the mountain is silent,
the rivers don’t babble anymore...

0:58:38.136 --> 0:58:40.770
...we have no rain.
We are stranded in this moorland.

0:58:40.936 --> 0:58:44.270
If we don’t move quickly our herds
will perish, our babies will die.

0:58:45.270 --> 0:58:47.870
Well? What is on your minds?

0:58:48.136 --> 0:58:52.136
A horse neighs according to its owner,
Kurdoglu. Our warning is to you.

0:58:52.436 --> 0:58:54.303
Weigh in on the decisions.

0:58:55.870 --> 0:58:59.303
Suleyman Shah is weak.
He can’t even ride a horse now.

0:59:00.003 --> 0:59:01.770
In other words, Kurdoglu...

0:59:02.070 --> 0:59:05.470
...horse belongs to who rides it,
sword belongs to who gird it.

0:59:18.136 --> 0:59:19.170
Mother?

0:59:25.236 --> 0:59:28.036
I came to Akcakoca to get
some healing herbs.

0:59:29.770 --> 0:59:33.103
He is out. Tell me what you want,
I will bring them to you, mother.

0:59:33.270 --> 0:59:35.436
No, I will come and pick them up later.

0:59:39.536 --> 0:59:41.070
Our guest.

0:59:41.436 --> 0:59:44.103
Numan Bey’s daughter. Halime.

0:59:48.270 --> 0:59:52.136
Welcome to our tribe, my girl.
How is your father, did he recover?

0:59:52.303 --> 0:59:55.936
-Yes.
-I am glad. May God heal him.

0:59:56.503 --> 1:00:00.503
Our tents are always open for you.
If you have a problem, do not hesitate...

1:00:00.870 --> 1:00:04.870
...come and tell me immediately, alright?
-May God bless you, Hayme Hanim.

1:00:16.403 --> 1:00:18.836
Not on the ground, not in the air...

1:00:19.903 --> 1:00:22.436
...only in the hearts of
devoted believers...

1:00:23.136 --> 1:00:26.536
...the One that creates,
makes all creation one...

1:00:26.870 --> 1:00:29.770
...in the name of God,
most Merciful and most Graceful.

1:00:30.136 --> 1:00:36.970
Between the blue skies and dark ground,
let our blood, our clan, our tribe...

1:00:37.803 --> 1:00:42.270
...our homes, our sons, our daughters...

1:00:42.803 --> 1:00:46.336
...be united, be free, be keen.

1:00:47.403 --> 1:00:51.770
In the presence of our most just Bey,
may we bless our headquarters.

1:00:52.103 --> 1:00:53.570
-Amen.
-Amen.

1:00:58.470 --> 1:01:03.270
In the 99 names of our Great God,
Who creates with only saying “let be”...

1:01:03.803 --> 1:01:08.370
...Who fills our hearts with belief.
In the name of God.

1:01:16.236 --> 1:01:17.303
Thank you.

1:01:33.870 --> 1:01:37.470
My beys, my warriors,
the leaders of my clans.

1:01:38.003 --> 1:01:39.936
Welcome and be blessed.

1:01:40.570 --> 1:01:42.170
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:01:42.370 --> 1:01:46.770
Thank God that before we set on the road
to sell our goods, a trader has come.

1:01:47.003 --> 1:01:50.203
I say that we sell our goods
to this trader at prime value...

1:01:50.370 --> 1:01:52.803
...and save from the travel expenses.

1:01:52.970 --> 1:01:55.470
That would be fine
if our only problem was the goods.

1:01:55.803 --> 1:01:58.503
We don’t have any pastures left
to graze our stock.

1:01:58.836 --> 1:02:02.770
They cannot drink water, cannot give milk.
They are all starving to death.

1:02:02.936 --> 1:02:05.303
We need to find a solution immediately.

1:02:05.536 --> 1:02:09.370
I also see the despair. We sent messengers
to all beys in the region.

1:02:09.770 --> 1:02:13.403
We asked for a territory
but famine is everywhere.

1:02:14.070 --> 1:02:18.270
Moreover, Turkmen tribes running away
from the Mongol invasion are everywhere.

1:02:18.436 --> 1:02:22.170
What shall we do, shall we draw our swords
against our brothers for a pasture?

1:02:22.303 --> 1:02:26.370
Is God’s merciful treasure is closed, Bey?
We have been camping here for months.

1:02:26.503 --> 1:02:30.336
We cannot find a solution.
When did Kayis became so desperate?

1:02:30.903 --> 1:02:34.070
-Isn’t there anywhere for us to go?
-If we cannot find a solution...

1:02:34.203 --> 1:02:36.036
...how can we sustain our tribe?

1:02:36.170 --> 1:02:40.203
Since when have we forgotten God,
the Bringer of Prosperity.

1:02:41.170 --> 1:02:43.970
Our souls are kneaded with patience.

1:02:45.536 --> 1:02:49.036
Whatever he blesses us with,
we should be happy.

1:02:49.970 --> 1:02:54.836
We learned what patience is by traveling
without a home, Wild Demir.

1:02:55.270 --> 1:02:59.236
Our wish is that our descendants don’t
wonder about without a home as well...

1:02:59.370 --> 1:03:01.070
...don’t tell us what patience is.

1:03:01.236 --> 1:03:05.836
When did I ever leave you without clothes
or food, for you to worry so much?

1:03:06.070 --> 1:03:08.503
Never, Bey. I did not mean like that.

1:03:08.903 --> 1:03:13.903
Bey, you never let us go bare or hungry.
At the same time we never let you be...

1:03:14.036 --> 1:03:16.803
...without soldiers or weapons.

1:03:17.836 --> 1:03:22.070
Bey, we say that we should find
a new home and migrate from here.

1:03:22.236 --> 1:03:25.436
-To where?
-Anywhere where our sheep can live.

1:03:25.836 --> 1:03:30.336
Let us go back to our forefathers’ lands.
They say the Mongols are getting weaker.

1:03:30.536 --> 1:03:34.870
Whoever says this is a liar! The Mongol
bandits are like hungry wolf packs.

1:03:35.103 --> 1:03:37.103
Didn’t anyone think of a solution, Bey?

1:03:38.503 --> 1:03:39.570
Aleppo.

1:03:50.570 --> 1:03:57.370
I heard that  Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz is
gathering an army against the crusaders.

1:03:58.270 --> 1:04:00.370
What do you have in mind, my nephew?

1:04:00.803 --> 1:04:05.203
I say that, we should send
an envoy to Ameer of Aleppo, El Aziz.

1:04:08.436 --> 1:04:14.003
He should say, “you give us a home,
we shall give you soldiers with weapons.”

1:04:15.003 --> 1:04:21.503
This way we can fight with the crusaders
to become veterans and at the same time...

1:04:21.936 --> 1:04:24.303
...we could have a place we can call home.

1:04:26.270 --> 1:04:27.536
Aleppo.

1:04:34.470 --> 1:04:36.270
We should act at once, Bey.

1:04:37.170 --> 1:04:40.336
Since when do we give a decision
before I say the last word?

1:04:42.170 --> 1:04:43.470
I am sorry, Bey.

1:04:48.536 --> 1:04:50.970
Do you accept Gundogdu’s suggestion, Agas?

1:04:51.436 --> 1:04:53.036
-We accept.
-Yes.

1:04:54.236 --> 1:04:57.936
I find it suitable as well.
May it be prosperous, if God permits.

1:04:58.070 --> 1:04:59.536
-If God permits.
-If God permits.

1:05:07.236 --> 1:05:09.503
Who will go as the envoy, Bey?

1:05:58.903 --> 1:06:00.003
Ertugrul!

1:06:07.803 --> 1:06:12.336
Suleyman Shah, some tactless people in
your tribe has put a smear in our honor.

1:06:13.036 --> 1:06:17.070
The honor of the Sultan who gave a home
to my tribe is my honor, Karatoygar.

1:06:17.236 --> 1:06:21.303
What did we do to dishonor
Sultan Aladdin and his commander?

1:06:25.036 --> 1:06:29.036
This axe came out of the man you killed.

1:06:32.270 --> 1:06:35.236
-Did you forget the axe there?
-I did.

1:06:35.970 --> 1:06:40.170
You ambushed an ambassador regiment
and slaughtered their knights.

1:06:41.203 --> 1:06:44.436
As if that was not enough,
you kidnapped the three prisoners...

1:06:44.803 --> 1:06:48.470
...the regiment was taking to the Sultan.
Give back those prisoners.

1:06:51.103 --> 1:06:54.036
You talk like you don’t know
our customs, Karatoygar!

1:06:54.870 --> 1:06:57.903
We do not hand over guests
who have come to our tribe.

1:06:58.036 --> 1:06:59.870
Especially if they are wounded.

1:07:00.036 --> 1:07:03.170
I came here as the representative
of the Seljuk Sultan.

1:07:03.436 --> 1:07:07.870
You have to obey my orders as if they are
coming out of the Sultan’s mouth.

1:07:08.170 --> 1:07:11.336
Or else, you know what would happen,
Suleyman Shah.

1:07:11.470 --> 1:07:14.236
We live and die with our customs,
Karatoygar!

1:07:14.803 --> 1:07:18.003
We know that the Sultan is ruling
the state but he would...

1:07:18.170 --> 1:07:21.936
...put his forefather Oguz’s
customs first, then sit on his throne.

1:07:22.103 --> 1:07:25.570
You cannot have a sultan from a man
who doesn’t know customs and tradition.

1:07:25.903 --> 1:07:27.936
You cannot be a Bey or a man!

1:07:28.203 --> 1:07:31.336
And we would not have anything to do
with someone who is not a man!

1:07:31.503 --> 1:07:35.003
You should know this as
a commander of the Great Seljuk.

1:07:36.370 --> 1:07:38.003
This was my last word.

1:07:38.803 --> 1:07:40.103
You can go now.

1:07:40.270 --> 1:07:45.036
We asked you nicely, Suleyman Shah.
You have two days.

1:07:46.336 --> 1:07:50.070
If you don’t give them,
we know how to come and get them.

1:07:54.103 --> 1:07:55.936
Don’t oppose the Seljuk.

1:07:56.103 --> 1:07:58.870
You know what would happen otherwise.

1:08:10.036 --> 1:08:14.036
-What is my father trying to do?
-He is too old to know what he is doing.

1:08:21.170 --> 1:08:25.903
I told you that it would all be revealed
soon. This is only the beginning.

1:08:28.336 --> 1:08:29.803
Stay here.

1:08:52.436 --> 1:08:55.470
Seljuk Sultan Aladdin Kayqubad’s
first assistant.

1:09:08.470 --> 1:09:10.770
Commander of Haremzshahs.

1:09:18.403 --> 1:09:21.003
Right hand man of the Khalifa, Omar.

1:09:24.036 --> 1:09:27.803
Now all the Muslim world shall
cry out revenge.

1:09:28.436 --> 1:09:30.836
Then it will be the turn of the Papacy.

1:10:01.770 --> 1:10:03.003
Bisol!

1:10:12.503 --> 1:10:13.870
Who did this?

1:10:14.470 --> 1:10:17.303
They ambushed the regiment
who was taking the prisoners.

1:10:18.103 --> 1:10:19.436
I said who?

1:10:20.103 --> 1:10:21.370
Kayis.

1:10:22.003 --> 1:10:23.870
But we don’t know who.

1:10:28.203 --> 1:10:29.303
Ertugrul!

1:10:30.470 --> 1:10:32.103
You caused all this!

1:10:33.570 --> 1:10:35.136
Don’t shout at me, brother.

1:10:35.270 --> 1:10:39.003
When will you stop being a stubborn brat?
You don’t care for anyone.

1:10:39.170 --> 1:10:41.003
Not your father, nor your tribe!

1:10:41.136 --> 1:10:42.903
What would have you done?

1:10:43.236 --> 1:10:46.270
What would have you done?
Would you turn away and go?

1:10:47.036 --> 1:10:49.403
The Gundogdu I know is not
that kind of a man.

1:10:49.870 --> 1:10:53.136
The Gundogdu I know would not
step on justice or fairness.

1:10:53.503 --> 1:10:58.236
Justice. Fairness.
What justice? What fairness?

1:10:58.536 --> 1:11:01.770
Look at the state of this tribe!
It is cracking up!

1:11:02.336 --> 1:11:06.003
Hunger is all around us! Winter is coming
and we don’t even know where to go!

1:11:06.136 --> 1:11:08.103
The animals are starving to death.

1:11:09.403 --> 1:11:13.370
Justice. Fairness. Open your eyes!

1:11:14.036 --> 1:11:16.870
Open your eyes! Look around you!

1:11:18.836 --> 1:11:20.970
Right in the middle of the headquarters!

1:11:21.803 --> 1:11:25.436
Look at what you did when matters of
life or death were discussed.

1:11:29.136 --> 1:11:33.036
How will this tribe stand strong,
Ertugrul? How?

1:11:50.136 --> 1:11:53.803
Forgive me, father.
I could not protect him.

1:11:57.336 --> 1:11:58.503
I could not.

1:12:01.536 --> 1:12:02.970
I could not.

1:12:17.436 --> 1:12:20.403
The world is not left to anyone,
let alone us, Aktolgali.

1:12:22.003 --> 1:12:24.503
What should a man live for,
in this world of lies?

1:12:26.870 --> 1:12:30.336
What should he ride to?
What should he gird his sword for?

1:12:31.070 --> 1:12:33.103
Why should he have a home?

1:12:35.903 --> 1:12:39.103
Why do we have states, customs or homes?

1:12:43.570 --> 1:12:48.470
The tyrant is going to make the sky fall
on us if we don’t give him the guests.

1:12:51.570 --> 1:12:54.203
Wouldn’t the sky fall on us if we do?

1:12:57.136 --> 1:13:00.103
If we don’t give them,
my father will be in trouble.

1:13:01.170 --> 1:13:03.170
What should I do, Aktolgali?

1:13:08.236 --> 1:13:11.536
For a world where we cannot
even command one breath...

1:13:12.870 --> 1:13:17.070
...are we going to give up?
Are we going to submit to the tyrant?

1:13:18.236 --> 1:13:20.536
Won’t our customs fall silent then?

1:13:20.936 --> 1:13:23.170
Won’t our fire burn out then?

1:13:23.870 --> 1:13:25.370
Right, Aktolgali?

1:13:38.403 --> 1:13:42.770
Karatoygar is a big tyrant.
He would do everything in his power.

1:13:44.036 --> 1:13:48.236
Aleppo was a good thought, Gundogdu.
You showed everyone your intelligence...

1:13:48.370 --> 1:13:51.203
...as well as the next Bey
when the time comes.

1:13:55.903 --> 1:13:58.870
We need to get rid of this Karatoygar
from our backs.

1:14:00.036 --> 1:14:02.870
When my father says “customs”
he never backs down.

1:14:03.336 --> 1:14:07.003
Ertugrul, look at the problems
you created for us.

1:14:08.436 --> 1:14:13.103
We need to convince my father. If we
convince him, Ertugrul would back down.

1:14:13.336 --> 1:14:15.803
You talk like you don’t know your father.

1:14:16.103 --> 1:14:18.803
He would not give them even
if the sky fell down.

1:14:19.936 --> 1:14:21.470
What will we do then?

1:14:23.270 --> 1:14:27.070
Your father told me that he will
send me to Karatoygar as an envoy.

1:14:28.203 --> 1:14:30.303
I will do anything that is required.

1:14:46.770 --> 1:14:48.070
Ertugrul Bey.

1:14:49.503 --> 1:14:50.936
Do you have time?

1:14:52.570 --> 1:14:54.570
What happened? Is there a problem?

1:14:55.870 --> 1:14:58.836
No. This is something else.

1:15:01.103 --> 1:15:02.270
I am listening.

1:15:02.836 --> 1:15:05.903
I heard that Karatoygar came.
He wanted us.

1:15:07.170 --> 1:15:10.370
-Yes, he did.
-Don’t put your tribe in danger for us.

1:15:11.336 --> 1:15:13.469
We can take care of ourselves.

1:15:14.003 --> 1:15:17.203
My father is getting better.
We can leave within two days.

1:15:19.469 --> 1:15:24.469
Even if all the world were against us,
we would not deliver you to those tyrants.

1:15:30.103 --> 1:15:33.470
If you get in a fight with Karatoygar,
there would be consequences.

1:15:33.803 --> 1:15:38.203
Don’t worry.
We Kayis know how to handle all hardships.

1:16:00.936 --> 1:16:02.003
What’s up?

1:16:06.503 --> 1:16:08.036
I cannot sleep, mother.

1:16:09.503 --> 1:16:10.870
Sit down.

1:16:19.203 --> 1:16:21.170
What do you dwell on now?

1:16:22.336 --> 1:16:25.803
I fell into a fire, mother.
I fell right in the middle of it.

1:16:26.070 --> 1:16:30.303
I would not mind if I got burnt alone,
but I threw the whole tribe into fire.

1:16:36.970 --> 1:16:40.770
When you were at the point of falling,
did you know that it would come to this?

1:16:40.970 --> 1:16:43.970
Whether you would be facing
those infidel bandits...

1:16:44.236 --> 1:16:47.770
...or that said commander being allies
with the crusaders?

1:16:49.303 --> 1:16:54.003
Could you have closed your eyes and
turned your back to the...

1:16:54.303 --> 1:16:58.770
-...cries of that gazelle eyed beauty?
-How could I, mother?

1:17:04.870 --> 1:17:09.536
You could not. You would not, my son.
You could not.

1:17:12.770 --> 1:17:16.403
You couldn’t have known that it would
come to this when you went hunting...

1:17:17.136 --> 1:17:21.070
...that you would be throwing
the whole tribe into fire with yourself.

1:17:23.170 --> 1:17:24.403
You threw us in.

1:17:27.803 --> 1:17:29.203
Yes, you did.

1:17:34.103 --> 1:17:38.036
The fire can burn a dough
and turn it into ash...

1:17:39.870 --> 1:17:42.870
...or it may cook the dough into bread.

1:17:43.803 --> 1:17:46.403
It was He who took you to
that place you fell.

1:17:46.803 --> 1:17:50.803
You don’t have the right to protest
His decision, nor does the tribe.

1:17:51.936 --> 1:17:57.270
This is a test from the Great God.
In this test we can either turn to ash...

1:17:57.803 --> 1:18:02.003
...or transform into bread. So don’t
listen to those whispers inside you...

1:18:02.303 --> 1:18:05.770
...or to the presumptuous people
inside the tribe.

1:18:07.770 --> 1:18:14.003
Become a soldier of our customs and stand
strong behind your father’s decisions.

1:18:17.303 --> 1:18:20.370
May God never take you or
my father away from leading us.

1:18:22.170 --> 1:18:24.136
May God protect you, my son.

1:18:28.036 --> 1:18:30.303
Come on, take this water and
put it to your father’s side.

1:19:58.203 --> 1:19:59.936
I brought you water, father.

1:20:04.336 --> 1:20:05.503
Give me some.

1:20:45.870 --> 1:20:48.136
I should have been there instead of you.

1:20:51.470 --> 1:20:55.236
I will fight until the blood of
the ones who did this to you is dried up.

1:20:55.403 --> 1:20:58.103
I will fight until the last one of
them is in a grave.

1:20:58.303 --> 1:21:01.903
You will be revenged, my brother.
I promise you.

1:21:03.136 --> 1:21:08.003
If God won’t be by my side on this path,
I will turn to devils.

1:21:08.970 --> 1:21:12.103
I will bring hell upon the Turkmens.

1:21:12.503 --> 1:21:15.803
I will be their wrath until the day I die.

1:21:18.370 --> 1:21:19.970
I promise you.

1:21:26.536 --> 1:21:28.136
Forgive me, father.

1:21:37.203 --> 1:21:41.770
That was it, Ilyas Fakih.
I didn’t know how to interpret this dream.

1:21:43.470 --> 1:21:46.970
But a lump of fire has been burning
inside me since last night.

1:22:03.503 --> 1:22:05.303
There are two options, Bey.

1:22:06.336 --> 1:22:08.470
First one is, hard times await us.

1:22:09.303 --> 1:22:10.770
The second is...

1:22:11.503 --> 1:22:14.836
...this may be a spiritual order on
who will be your successor.

1:22:14.837 --> 1:22:14.952


1:22:24.843 --> 1:22:25.943
Father?

1:22:34.310 --> 1:22:37.376
-Are you fine? Do you have any pain?
-Do not worry.

1:22:37.676 --> 1:22:40.610
I am awake now. I will be up in no time.

1:22:41.176 --> 1:22:42.243
Thank God.

1:22:43.843 --> 1:22:45.043
Get well soon.

1:22:45.743 --> 1:22:48.076
If you need anything Yigit can inform us.

1:22:50.276 --> 1:22:52.943
Ertugrul. Yigit told me everything.

1:22:54.010 --> 1:22:57.076
You and the people who raised
you are valiant people.

1:22:58.043 --> 1:23:00.276
You saved and protected us.

1:23:00.743 --> 1:23:04.243
We did what our customs order us to do.
There is no debt for that.

1:23:05.210 --> 1:23:08.710
The people in these lands have long
forgotten their customs.

1:23:09.043 --> 1:23:13.843
We must be God’s loved subjects for
someone like you to be there for us.

1:23:13.976 --> 1:23:15.410
Please don’t say that.

1:23:15.810 --> 1:23:18.143
I should go. And you should rest.

1:23:25.076 --> 1:23:29.010
Listen to me, Halime.
Find us some horses immediately.

1:23:30.143 --> 1:23:34.043
Get prepared with your brother.
Don’t let anyone get suspicious.

1:23:34.310 --> 1:23:36.910
What is happening, father?
What will we do?

1:23:37.810 --> 1:23:39.076
We are going.

1:23:40.410 --> 1:23:42.810
Halime, there is no other way.

1:23:43.976 --> 1:23:49.910
If we stay for one more day,
we would endanger their lives as well.

1:23:55.310 --> 1:23:56.810
I am going to the stable.

1:23:57.110 --> 1:24:00.110
Right before the headquarters,
where is this coming from, Gundogdu?

1:24:00.310 --> 1:24:02.743
I am going to look at
the new horse they brought.

1:24:02.910 --> 1:24:05.276
And you can start preparing
for the Aleppo journey.

1:24:05.610 --> 1:24:07.676
I can make everything ready but...

1:24:10.976 --> 1:24:13.643
...is it confirmed that
you will be going to Aleppo?

1:24:13.976 --> 1:24:15.076
Don’t say that.

1:24:18.676 --> 1:24:21.043
I was the one who put forth
the idea at the headquarters.

1:24:21.210 --> 1:24:23.110
It is my right to be the envoy.

1:24:24.243 --> 1:24:26.343
-Of course but...
-Of course but what?

1:24:26.676 --> 1:24:29.176
Why are you worked up
so early in the morning, Selcan?

1:24:29.310 --> 1:24:33.110
I don’t know whether I should worry about
the fact that you will be going or...

1:24:33.276 --> 1:24:36.643
...the disappointment you will feel
if your father does not choose you.

1:24:36.776 --> 1:24:39.210
Of course he will send me.
Who else can he send?

1:24:45.343 --> 1:24:50.610
Hatun, look, if you are feeling sad
that I will be going...

1:24:51.276 --> 1:24:55.276
...during the time I go and come back,
you can greet me with two lives.

1:25:01.076 --> 1:25:05.610
When you are dealing with the horses in
the stable and me preparing you...

1:25:05.810 --> 1:25:09.710
...provisions for the journey, you'd be
waiting for a very long time, Gundogdu.

1:25:11.910 --> 1:25:14.210
I can check the horses after
the headquarters then.

1:25:17.143 --> 1:25:18.776
Bey, do we have permission?

1:25:24.243 --> 1:25:25.843
Come in, Hamza, come in.

1:25:27.843 --> 1:25:31.243
-What happened?
-Bey, Suleyman Shah wants to see you.

1:25:33.843 --> 1:25:36.076
In the name of God. In the name of God.

1:25:37.210 --> 1:25:38.676
In the name of God.

1:25:44.243 --> 1:25:45.410
In the name of God.

1:26:05.810 --> 1:26:07.843
I have decided that...

1:26:08.643 --> 1:26:10.643
...Ertugrul will go to Aleppo.

1:26:21.610 --> 1:26:22.676
Gundogdu.

1:26:23.910 --> 1:26:26.076
I have some things to discuss with you.

1:26:26.943 --> 1:26:28.110
Stay here.

1:26:32.176 --> 1:26:34.843
Ertugrul, you go and prepare yourself.

1:26:35.243 --> 1:26:38.210
Tell Ilyas Fakih that
he will be coming with you.

1:27:02.376 --> 1:27:03.710
Come on!

1:27:03.910 --> 1:27:05.810
Come on! Quick!

1:27:06.110 --> 1:27:08.676
Faster, Turgut, faster! Come on!

1:27:09.310 --> 1:27:10.676
Come on!

1:27:13.410 --> 1:27:15.810
-I won!
-I won!

1:27:16.010 --> 1:27:18.876
Don’t be ridiculous, I won!
I passed the line first!

1:27:19.076 --> 1:27:21.843
-What are you saying?
-I was the first to pass the line!

1:27:21.976 --> 1:27:23.276
Ask Aykiz!

1:27:23.776 --> 1:27:26.143
Aykiz cannot be the referee.
She is your sweetheart.

1:27:26.310 --> 1:27:30.343
How can you say this, Bamsi Beyrek?
When did I ever lie?

1:27:32.676 --> 1:27:35.943
-I told you not to do that!
-What would you do if I do?

1:27:36.110 --> 1:27:40.243
-Your brain is as big as a walnut.
-But I am a hard nut to crack!

1:27:40.610 --> 1:27:43.076
Don’t be afraid! Come on then! Come on!

1:27:43.276 --> 1:27:45.076
Stop right there! Stop!

1:27:51.710 --> 1:27:53.243
What is wrong with Ertugrul?

1:27:54.076 --> 1:27:56.243
Suleyman Shah called him to his tent.

1:27:56.676 --> 1:28:00.143
-I wonder what the problem is.
-He is probably going gazelle hunting.

1:28:00.276 --> 1:28:02.810
That gazelle deserved to be hunted.

1:28:11.410 --> 1:28:13.943
Get ready. We are going to Aleppo.

1:28:15.310 --> 1:28:18.210
Bamsi! We are going to Aleppo, Bamsi!

1:28:21.310 --> 1:28:23.810
I was getting fat sitting all day!

1:28:25.010 --> 1:28:27.776
Tell Ilyas Fakih as well,
he is coming with us.

1:28:41.343 --> 1:28:47.376
I brought up the Aleppo idea.
I told you that El Aziz needed soldiers.

1:28:50.776 --> 1:28:52.643
Why him and not me, father?

1:29:01.876 --> 1:29:03.343
Because of this, son.

1:29:04.010 --> 1:29:07.710
“I know. I can do. I said.”

1:29:08.643 --> 1:29:11.143
When did arrogance grew inside you?

1:29:12.176 --> 1:29:16.043
Am I the arrogant one?
The whole tribe is starving.

1:29:16.676 --> 1:29:19.943
Famine is everywhere.
We could not even go on a foray.

1:29:20.176 --> 1:29:21.410
Why?

1:29:21.976 --> 1:29:24.910
-Because our Bey has a boil problem.
-Know your place!

1:29:25.043 --> 1:29:29.110
Let it go, father. The whole tribe
complains about your old age.

1:30:02.676 --> 1:30:04.610
-Brother?
-Get your hands off me!

1:30:35.643 --> 1:30:38.743
Do you think it is your brother’s right
to be the ambassador?

1:30:40.343 --> 1:30:41.343
Yes.

1:30:42.710 --> 1:30:44.310
Why me and not my brother?

1:30:44.710 --> 1:30:48.210
Because he started to worship
the flame of power. His soul is captured.

1:30:53.310 --> 1:30:55.143
So I put out the flame.

1:31:02.176 --> 1:31:04.676
Now, let us talk about
the flame within you.

1:31:04.876 --> 1:31:07.843
Our guests will stay
with the tribe until you come back.

1:31:08.643 --> 1:31:12.210
I am telling you this so that
you can focus on your mission.

1:31:13.910 --> 1:31:16.110
Do not come back empty handed from Aleppo.

1:31:17.243 --> 1:31:19.676
The future of Kayi is on your shoulders.

1:31:20.043 --> 1:31:22.910
Your failure will mean
the calamity of all of us.

1:31:23.910 --> 1:31:27.810
For the land El Aziz is going to give us,
we shall accept any price.

1:31:29.343 --> 1:31:32.110
But not a single Oguz
is a sacrificial lamb.

1:31:32.876 --> 1:31:36.410
Don’t you ever forget.
As much as you need a home near Aleppo...

1:31:36.910 --> 1:31:39.410
...Ameer  of Aleppo needs Kayi’s Alps.

1:31:39.910 --> 1:31:44.076
Do not ever bow your head down.
Show them that you are a real Oguz...

1:31:44.310 --> 1:31:47.143
...who knows what he wants and
is ready to make a just deal.

1:31:50.876 --> 1:31:52.076
May God help you.

1:31:53.243 --> 1:31:56.010
I shall succeed in my duty
even if the cost is my life, father.

1:31:56.676 --> 1:31:58.643
I shall be back to make you proud.

1:32:03.010 --> 1:32:04.143
What happened?

1:32:04.976 --> 1:32:06.176
Gundogdu!

1:32:06.776 --> 1:32:09.276
-Gundogdu, stop! Stop!
-Leave me alone!

1:32:10.810 --> 1:32:12.376
Friends, Alps!

1:32:13.810 --> 1:32:15.843
Stop! Please!

1:32:21.210 --> 1:32:23.043
Out! Get out!

1:32:45.910 --> 1:32:47.676
Aren’t you going to talk?

1:32:48.110 --> 1:32:51.076
Ambassador.
Ertugrul became the ambassador.

1:32:53.110 --> 1:32:54.876
-I told you!
-Enough!

1:33:02.743 --> 1:33:04.343
Take it! Drink.

1:33:05.410 --> 1:33:06.810
Drink this.

1:33:13.710 --> 1:33:15.810
This must be Mother Hayme’s doing.

1:33:16.043 --> 1:33:20.110
I don’t care less. It does not matter.
I know what I am going to do.

1:33:20.343 --> 1:33:22.976
No! Please do not act in fury.

1:33:23.343 --> 1:33:25.310
Those who act with fury always lose.

1:33:25.610 --> 1:33:27.943
Enough, woman!
For the love of God, enough!

1:33:29.010 --> 1:33:31.910
Finish your business.
Be ready with your Alps.

1:33:32.210 --> 1:33:35.376
When that tactless brother of yours
messes everything up...

1:33:35.810 --> 1:33:39.276
...you will get what you deserve.
And do not forget.

1:33:40.210 --> 1:33:43.243
Angels of death wait for
the big day in the Bey’s marquee.

1:33:49.043 --> 1:33:52.910
The news got stuck in my throat, Turgut.
I cannot swallow it...

1:33:53.876 --> 1:33:55.410
...nor can I spit it out.

1:33:57.043 --> 1:33:59.976
You talk like this is the first time
we will be apart, Aykiz.

1:34:00.143 --> 1:34:02.276
When did we ever be together, Turgut?

1:34:02.676 --> 1:34:06.243
Is waiting for the road at your father’s
tent and waiting for your man...

1:34:06.376 --> 1:34:08.310
...in your husband’s tent be the same?

1:34:09.410 --> 1:34:12.776
It is not the sorrow of separation
that is stuck in my throat...

1:34:14.010 --> 1:34:16.143
...it is not being able to come together.

1:34:17.310 --> 1:34:21.243
Anytime we talk about getting married,
it gets delayed for some reason.

1:34:24.410 --> 1:34:27.776
I promise.
There will be no delay this time.

1:34:29.176 --> 1:34:32.110
I don’t know whether
Aleppo will be a success or not but...

1:34:32.410 --> 1:34:36.143
...the first wedding in our new land
will be ours. I promise you.

1:34:36.643 --> 1:34:41.910
The drummers will cry out “Aykiz and
Turgut are finally getting married.”

1:34:42.843 --> 1:34:47.376
All the girls in the weaving area
will say, “the most beautiful girl...

1:34:47.710 --> 1:34:51.243
...of the tribe is getting married,
from now on it be our turn.”

1:34:51.810 --> 1:34:55.310
When you leave Wild  Demir’s tent,
even the Sultan’s daughters will...

1:34:55.643 --> 1:34:57.610
...get jealous of your beauty.

1:35:08.943 --> 1:35:11.843
I wanted to say how sorry I am.
I do not know the words...

1:35:11.976 --> 1:35:15.310
...that can describe this pain.
-Only you can understand me, Elanora.

1:35:15.710 --> 1:35:18.043
Your father’s killers were
Muslims as well.

1:35:19.876 --> 1:35:22.276
May you have a good journey, Titus.
Be careful.

1:35:22.410 --> 1:35:24.810
I will be back, Elanora. See you soon.

1:35:38.343 --> 1:35:43.743
You have witnessed a good commander
transform into a real Templar knight.

1:35:45.010 --> 1:35:48.110
Revenge.
That was the only thing lacking in Titus.

1:35:48.610 --> 1:35:52.876
If there is no revenge, a hay soldier
and a knight are no different.

1:35:54.076 --> 1:35:57.210
Bisol’s death became Titus’ miracle.

1:35:58.276 --> 1:36:01.210
May God forgive Bisol’s sins.

1:36:26.843 --> 1:36:31.410
Looking at the presents, I can say that
Suleyman Shah realized the mistake he did.

1:36:33.010 --> 1:36:35.976
Our Bey likes the Seljuk,
he respects them.

1:36:37.710 --> 1:36:40.243
But only I can solve this issue,
Karatoygar.

1:36:41.843 --> 1:36:45.910
The time limit I have put down
expires in the morning, Kurdoglu.

1:36:46.610 --> 1:36:52.843
Or else the Seljuk’s wrath will burn
the whole Kayi tribe.

1:36:53.376 --> 1:36:57.910
-You would burn with us, Karatoygar.
-How dare you?

1:36:58.610 --> 1:37:01.376
Don’t tell me that
the Sultan knows about this.

1:37:02.043 --> 1:37:05.910
Your manpower is not enough
to take them from Kayi by force.

1:37:06.943 --> 1:37:09.010
You need to raise a whole army.

1:37:11.376 --> 1:37:15.710
I am aware that you have armies
that are strong enough to crush Kayi.

1:37:15.943 --> 1:37:21.143
You can do that. But first,
the Sultan would have to be informed.

1:37:21.910 --> 1:37:26.143
And this would not suit you.
It would not suit us either.

1:37:26.976 --> 1:37:32.876
I shall come to the point. For you and
the tribe to win at the same time...

1:37:33.943 --> 1:37:36.143
...you need to hear what I have to say.

1:37:37.943 --> 1:37:41.243
If you aim to cooperate...

1:37:43.176 --> 1:37:46.410
...tell me. Who did this?

1:37:49.610 --> 1:37:51.110
Was it Suleyman Shah?

1:37:58.410 --> 1:38:01.410
Suleyman Shah’s son Ertugrul.

1:38:12.776 --> 1:38:14.110
Bamsi, Dogan.

1:38:32.376 --> 1:38:34.176
The word is out about a journey.

1:38:36.143 --> 1:38:37.243
When?

1:38:38.210 --> 1:38:40.943
We shall set on the road to Aleppo
at the morning prayer.

1:38:43.743 --> 1:38:45.043
Are you prepared?

1:38:46.710 --> 1:38:48.943
The Alps are always ready for anything.

1:38:49.410 --> 1:38:53.243
True. Everything seems easy
when you get used to it.

1:38:54.976 --> 1:38:57.643
Sometimes it gets harder
when you get used to it.

1:39:19.876 --> 1:39:21.343
May you have a good journey.

1:39:23.310 --> 1:39:24.976
May the sun not burn you.

1:39:27.010 --> 1:39:28.643
May you don’t get cold.

1:39:31.143 --> 1:39:34.043
May your feet don’t touch a stone.
May you go like water...

1:39:34.810 --> 1:39:36.810
...return to your tribe like water.

1:39:43.910 --> 1:39:47.310
My horse shall fly me to
my destination and back to my tribe.

1:39:50.776 --> 1:39:52.976
Your father and mother would be happy.

1:39:54.376 --> 1:39:55.710
What about you?

1:39:56.776 --> 1:39:57.910
Me?

1:39:59.710 --> 1:40:01.410
I would be long gone.

1:40:01.943 --> 1:40:03.210
You cannot go...

1:40:04.410 --> 1:40:06.043
...before I come back.

1:40:08.010 --> 1:40:10.076
Your father would not recover fully.

1:40:16.876 --> 1:40:19.076
May you have a good journey, Ertugrul Bey.

1:40:20.243 --> 1:40:21.710
All of us.

1:40:32.243 --> 1:40:36.210
There is something I wonder.
Our involuntary guests...

1:40:36.410 --> 1:40:39.210
...are they relatives of
Sultan Aladdin or something?

1:40:39.376 --> 1:40:44.210
-That does not concern you!
-True. It does not concern me.

1:40:44.910 --> 1:40:47.243
Come to the point. What is on your mind?

1:40:48.076 --> 1:40:52.143
If you want to take what you want,
I shall have one small condition.

1:41:30.710 --> 1:41:31.876
Ertugrul...

1:41:34.643 --> 1:41:37.676
...whatever my late wife and Aykiz are...

1:41:38.043 --> 1:41:42.743
...Halime and her family are the same
for me. Don’t you worry about them.

1:41:46.243 --> 1:41:48.343
May God bless you, Wild  Demir.

1:41:50.343 --> 1:41:55.410
May God bless you instead.
Trust makes a man grow.

1:41:56.143 --> 1:42:02.743
You trusted me in this tribe,
you came to my door, you confided in me...

1:42:03.276 --> 1:42:09.843
...that is why, may God bless you. Halime
and her family are my responsibility.

1:42:10.243 --> 1:42:13.976
You can be rest assured.
Come on, may God be with you.

1:42:34.076 --> 1:42:37.010
My son. My life.

1:42:38.643 --> 1:42:40.243
My dear son...

1:42:41.876 --> 1:42:44.343
...may your road
and fortune be always open.

1:42:44.676 --> 1:42:47.043
The weight of Kayi is on your shoulders...

1:42:47.243 --> 1:42:51.110
...never bow your head
nor give a promise you cannot keep.

1:43:05.043 --> 1:43:06.910
May God give you a clear road.

1:44:16.143 --> 1:44:18.376
<i>You may be going and not coming back.</i>

1:44:19.143 --> 1:44:21.310
<i>You may come back but not see me.</i>

1:44:22.110 --> 1:44:24.910
<i>I will ride tirelessly to see you again.</i>

1:44:25.910 --> 1:44:28.010
<i>May you have a clear road, Ertugrul.</i>

1:45:39.343 --> 1:45:42.810
While you were being punished for
rebelling against your father...

1:45:43.710 --> 1:45:45.976
...the little Bey became the ambassador.

1:46:39.310 --> 1:46:41.010
I knew you would come.

1:46:45.010 --> 1:46:46.176
Welcome.

1:46:55.076 --> 1:46:57.776
I don’t care about the prisoners,
Karatoygar.

1:46:58.610 --> 1:47:00.343
They ran away in your territory.

1:47:00.776 --> 1:47:02.276
We did our part.

1:47:02.976 --> 1:47:06.243
Give me the name of the person
who killed my brother.

1:47:09.976 --> 1:47:13.176
You are impatient to become a hangman.

1:47:14.643 --> 1:47:18.376
Be careful, don’t let the noose of
the hangman get around you neck.

1:47:19.310 --> 1:47:23.410
Don’t try to delegate
your own inaptitude to me.

1:47:24.210 --> 1:47:28.943
The knights you brag about could not
deal with a few trifling Alps.

1:47:30.410 --> 1:47:33.176
What do you want from me to give his name?

1:47:33.410 --> 1:47:37.610
I will give you more than you want.

1:47:38.210 --> 1:47:40.676
I will deliver him directly to you.

1:47:41.310 --> 1:47:43.910
This is not an issue of business.

1:47:44.310 --> 1:47:50.843
Do you understand me?
It is an assistance to a friend in pain.

1:47:51.810 --> 1:47:55.143
We never let ourselves stay indebted
on any help we receive.

1:47:55.810 --> 1:47:57.143
Alright.

1:47:57.976 --> 1:47:59.110
Who?

1:48:01.676 --> 1:48:04.110
Suleyman Shah’ son...

1:48:05.176 --> 1:48:06.976
...Ertugrul.

1:49:12.210 --> 1:49:13.376
Aykiz...

1:49:14.243 --> 1:49:16.743
...can you look at these patterns as well?

1:49:17.776 --> 1:49:19.043
I won’t be long.

1:49:35.243 --> 1:49:36.943
When are you leaving?

1:49:41.276 --> 1:49:42.976
When my father says so.

1:49:43.276 --> 1:49:45.376
Do not try to stand strong.

1:49:46.810 --> 1:49:49.743
People do not stay in a place
where they are not wanted.

1:49:49.943 --> 1:49:52.943
If you have some sense of shame,
go at once.

1:49:53.376 --> 1:49:56.176
It is customary.
You cannot say go to a guest.

1:49:56.343 --> 1:49:58.410
That is why everyone keeps quiet.

1:50:01.243 --> 1:50:02.776
And...

1:50:03.810 --> 1:50:06.843
...will you paying your debt
to these people like this?

1:50:07.076 --> 1:50:11.276
Is this what you deem proper for people
who gave you bread, their own tent...

1:50:11.610 --> 1:50:13.610
...and dressed your wounds?

1:50:15.776 --> 1:50:16.943
-I...
-You...

1:50:17.676 --> 1:50:21.176
While you try to flirt around,
blood will be spilt in the tribe.

1:50:21.343 --> 1:50:23.276
Blood. Go your own way.

1:50:31.243 --> 1:50:33.610
Halime. Halime!

1:50:33.876 --> 1:50:34.976
Selcan!

1:50:44.010 --> 1:50:45.676
What did you tell the girl?

1:50:46.943 --> 1:50:48.610
What she needed to hear.

1:50:50.343 --> 1:50:53.343
Is it your duty to tell her
what she needs to hear?

1:50:55.276 --> 1:50:57.643
I am thinking about
the future of the tribe.

1:50:57.776 --> 1:51:00.010
That girl should have heard this long ago.

1:51:01.343 --> 1:51:04.776
Such a shame.
Daugther of a Bey forgets our customs.

1:51:05.910 --> 1:51:09.010
She talks on top of the words
of her forefathers.

1:51:11.910 --> 1:51:13.810
Come to your senses, Selcan.

1:51:14.743 --> 1:51:18.410
Otherwise, you might find yourself
under the stones you thought you crushed.

1:51:31.243 --> 1:51:33.343
-What happened?
-Mind your own business!

1:52:38.943 --> 1:52:42.210
Ertugrul has gone on a journey
with four Alps.

1:52:43.710 --> 1:52:47.176
Eye for an eye. Devine justice.

1:52:47.610 --> 1:52:49.976
-Where is he going?
-To Aleppo.

1:52:51.110 --> 1:52:53.310
I shall take revenge with my own hands.

1:52:53.710 --> 1:52:56.143
I can never let you do that, Titus.

1:52:58.976 --> 1:53:00.210
Why?

1:53:00.610 --> 1:53:03.243
These lands are my jurisdiction.

1:53:04.110 --> 1:53:07.776
In my borders, only I can use force.

1:53:09.176 --> 1:53:13.143
If it is heard that I made an alliance
with the crusaders to spill blood...

1:53:13.410 --> 1:53:15.176
...our plan would fail.

1:53:15.676 --> 1:53:18.276
This man killed my brother, Karatoygar.

1:53:18.876 --> 1:53:21.043
I want you to bring him to me alive.

1:53:21.210 --> 1:53:23.610
I shall take his life with my own hands.

1:53:23.810 --> 1:53:29.943
Don’t you worry. I will present him to you
like a sacrificial ram.

1:53:33.676 --> 1:53:35.410
Karatoygar is convinced, Bey.

1:53:35.810 --> 1:53:39.210
He wanted us to look after them
until they get better.

1:53:39.943 --> 1:53:42.010
Did you manage to learn who they are?

1:53:42.410 --> 1:53:45.376
The pig’s son did not even utter
a single word about it.

1:53:45.710 --> 1:53:49.410
If they made the great Seljuks stand up,
the issue must be serious.

1:53:49.976 --> 1:53:52.410
Our part should be to benefit from this.

1:53:55.343 --> 1:53:56.943
You asked for me, Bey.

1:53:59.176 --> 1:54:03.343
If you don’t have anything else to say,
you must be very tired, go and rest.

1:54:33.243 --> 1:54:35.943
Save me from this pest of a boil,
Akcakoca.

1:54:36.343 --> 1:54:37.809
If God permits, Bey.

1:54:38.910 --> 1:54:40.776
My death will be from this.

1:54:51.376 --> 1:54:54.143
-Inform me of all developments.
-As you wish, Bey.

1:55:31.243 --> 1:55:32.943
Everything is ready, father.

1:55:35.410 --> 1:55:39.376
I have all the provisions ready,
we will be going tonight.

1:55:40.610 --> 1:55:45.076
Don’t worry about your wound, I watched
Akcakoca very closely to see what he does.

1:55:45.743 --> 1:55:47.843
Halime, calm down, my girl.

1:55:48.610 --> 1:55:52.676
We will be running away from a place
we took refuge, as usual. That is all.

1:55:54.710 --> 1:55:56.143
Is that all, father?

1:55:57.610 --> 1:55:59.243
Is it only that for you?

1:56:12.210 --> 1:56:16.043
I don’t know what goes through
your mind but...

1:56:17.876 --> 1:56:20.643
...what makes this place
different for you?

1:56:22.110 --> 1:56:24.343
Is there anything you are not telling me?

1:56:25.310 --> 1:56:27.110
I am very tired, father.

1:56:29.110 --> 1:56:31.110
I am tired of running away.

1:56:34.843 --> 1:56:39.276
Let us start a new life.
Go some place where no one will find us.

1:56:39.843 --> 1:56:43.876
Let us go beyond deserts and seas
but go from here, that is all I want.

1:56:46.176 --> 1:56:47.743
Father?

1:56:48.276 --> 1:56:50.876
What happened, son? What happened, Yigit?

1:56:52.210 --> 1:56:54.410
We have a guest. He wants to come in.

1:56:55.910 --> 1:56:57.076
Let him in.

1:57:00.076 --> 1:57:02.910
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

1:57:03.743 --> 1:57:04.810
Please.

1:57:05.810 --> 1:57:09.043
Father, look. Wild  Demir made
a sword for you and my sister.

1:57:10.010 --> 1:57:13.643
He is the best ironsmith in the region.
He makes the best swords.

1:57:13.876 --> 1:57:18.010
Please don’t exaggerate, son.
Ours is only a pastime.

1:57:19.110 --> 1:57:21.676
-These are yours.
-Thank you.

1:57:22.310 --> 1:57:24.010
Don't mention it, my girl.

1:57:24.243 --> 1:57:28.243
As Ertugrul Bey is not here,
I did not want you to be without weapons.

1:57:28.776 --> 1:57:32.010
He would feel more comfortable.
I would do too.

1:57:33.143 --> 1:57:36.276
Anyway, I am at my workshop
but my eye is on your tent.

1:57:36.676 --> 1:57:39.243
If you need anything,
please do not hesitate.

1:57:40.110 --> 1:57:42.076
What could happen in a big tribe?

1:57:47.043 --> 1:57:50.843
Look, my girl.
Ertugrul Bey is like a son to me.

1:57:51.710 --> 1:57:55.710
So I would never turn back his request.

1:58:06.610 --> 1:58:08.110
This was not called for.

1:58:31.276 --> 1:58:32.843
We will go this way.

1:58:33.343 --> 1:58:36.676
Tell Ertugrul that horses should
rest a bit. They are exhausted.

1:58:37.176 --> 1:58:40.643
His mind is with Halime.
He wants to return before they go.

1:58:40.843 --> 1:58:43.110
If you have the courage, you tell him.

1:58:48.376 --> 1:58:49.710
Bey.

1:58:52.243 --> 1:58:55.876
Us being exhausted is not an issue
but the horses are very tired.

1:58:56.310 --> 1:58:59.210
Bey, shall we rest a bit
beside the stream?

1:59:02.310 --> 1:59:05.876
We can set camp down there.
We will set off before sunrise.

1:59:06.376 --> 1:59:09.343
-Dogan, light a fire.
-As you wish, Bey.

1:59:19.243 --> 1:59:20.843
Follow me quietly.

2:01:22.743 --> 2:01:24.110
Peace be upon you.

2:01:24.910 --> 2:01:26.710
And peace be upon you.

2:01:27.210 --> 2:01:29.076
What happened to the gazelle?

2:01:30.776 --> 2:01:36.043
We found it like this. It was probably
wounded while running away from a hunter.

2:01:42.810 --> 2:01:44.676
I think that hunter was me.

2:01:47.876 --> 2:01:51.676
If you let this game get away,
you must be a bad hunter.

2:01:53.710 --> 2:01:55.076
I guess so.

2:01:56.310 --> 2:02:01.010
Look at that beautiful face. So you
managed to escape from this big valiant.

2:02:01.310 --> 2:02:07.910
Well done to you.
In the name of God, may you recover soon.

2:02:25.310 --> 2:02:28.810
Come on now. Go. Go on.

2:02:31.276 --> 2:02:33.643
Where do you come from and
where do you go?

2:02:33.843 --> 2:02:36.076
We come from nowhere, to go anywhere.

2:02:42.176 --> 2:02:43.643
What about you?

2:02:44.610 --> 2:02:46.176
We are going to Aleppo.

2:02:47.710 --> 2:02:49.976
Then you should always be alert.

2:02:50.210 --> 2:02:52.643
Don’t become a hunt for
wolves and vultures.

2:02:52.776 --> 2:02:55.910
The air here is very hazy.
Don’t be lost in the haze.

2:03:02.676 --> 2:03:04.343
Will you grant me your name?

2:03:06.643 --> 2:03:09.276
Ibn Arabi from Andalusia.

2:03:29.100 --> 2:03:30.200
The time has come.

2:03:31.166 --> 2:03:33.133
-Horses?
-Horses are ready.

2:03:37.866 --> 2:03:41.766
I hid the saddles under the hay.
We will saddle up and go immediately.

2:03:43.266 --> 2:03:45.166
There is no guard at the stable.

2:03:51.300 --> 2:03:54.933
-Will you be able to endure it, father?
-We have to do this.

2:04:05.400 --> 2:04:07.066
<i>May you have a good journey.</i>

2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:08.866
<i>May the sun not burn you.</i>

2:04:09.033 --> 2:04:10.600
<i>May you don’t get cold.</i>

2:04:11.200 --> 2:04:13.866
<i>May your feet don’t touch a stone.</i>
 <i>May you go like water...</i>

2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:16.033
<i>...return to your tribe like water.</i>

2:04:24.900 --> 2:04:26.933
Bamsi, is he asleep?

2:04:29.133 --> 2:04:31.400
No, he is thinking of Halime Baci.

2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:36.300
-Keep your voice down!
-Don’t talk to me like that.

2:04:36.766 --> 2:04:38.300
Enough! Be quiet!

2:04:40.366 --> 2:04:42.300
Go to sleep. Be quiet.

2:05:13.033 --> 2:05:14.800
You should relax, Titus.

2:05:15.700 --> 2:05:19.366
Before the sunrise,
we shall both get what we want.

2:05:20.400 --> 2:05:24.000
To look down on the enemy
is for the stupid, Karatoygar.

2:05:24.266 --> 2:05:29.333
No one can escape from
a well planned ambush, Titus.

2:05:31.066 --> 2:05:32.333
No one.

2:05:33.033 --> 2:05:37.133
I will deal with Wild Demir.
You finish the job quietly.

2:05:39.133 --> 2:05:40.200
Come on.
