00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Episode 23 will start after 12:22 min

00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:25,551
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

3
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:30,389
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

4
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:34,602
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

5
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:48,970
Show Kurdoglu to everybody
in front of my marquee until he is tried.

6
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:55,904
It will be an example for the ones who may
attempt to put us in this shame again.

7
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,737
We did not act together
with this bastard, Bey.

8
00:13:01,804 --> 00:13:04,737
But we could not stand straight
and go against him...

9
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,904
...like our Alps and beys
who were martyred, either. Forgive us.

10
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:12,370
We would like to kiss your hand
if you permit.

11
00:13:12,437 --> 00:13:14,537
Forgive us.

12
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:51,737
That bastard who has not
had his share from being fair...

13
00:15:51,837 --> 00:15:57,970
...did every kinds of persecutions
to my family and my brave brothers.

14
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:02,937
However, I will never avoid
being fair.

15
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:07,370
He will be punished in the
headquarters meeting.

16
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:13,537
The punishment
will be executed as decided.

17
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:18,204
Nobody should doubt it.

18
00:16:18,504 --> 00:16:21,804
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

19
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,904
Even though
we are surrounded by enemies...

20
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:34,870
...and the Crusaders give us trouble...

21
00:16:35,737 --> 00:16:38,470
...we did not lose our unity.

22
00:16:40,537 --> 00:16:45,304
The fire of instigation among us
has been put out as of today.

23
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:50,504
No matter how strong our enemy is...

24
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:55,204
...we will protect both our tent
and our religion, by God's will.

25
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,470
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

26
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,837
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

27
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,837
This drug will decrease your pain.

28
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:12,570
I am very sorry, sir.

29
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,470
I remember the infidels
I have poisoned all this time.

30
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:28,370
The ones from Ayyubids, Seljuks...

31
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:36,537
The Council of the Templars
will arrive soon, doctor.

32
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:43,870
This must be kept as a secret
between us until they leave.

33
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:45,837
Do you understand me?

34
00:18:45,904 --> 00:18:47,270
Yes, sir.

35
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:48,870
May God protect you, sir.

36
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:52,470
God has left me, doctor.

37
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:59,937
And Kurdoglu whom I worked
so hard on with high hopes, lost the game.

38
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:02,904
Kayis are a bigger enemy now.

39
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:07,404
What I am curious about is that...

40
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:13,337
...where my niece Isadora
found this poisoned dagger from.

41
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,304
The great grandmasters
of the Council are here! Open the gates!

42
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,570
Excuse me, Grandmaster Petruchio.

43
00:20:08,937 --> 00:20:11,370
Welcome, Grandmasters.

44
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:13,270
You honored our castle.

45
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:16,270
Thank you, Titus.

46
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:19,604
Where is Grandmaster Petruchio?

47
00:20:20,904 --> 00:20:25,204
What is so important
that he could not come here to welcome us?

48
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:30,504
He will welcome you in his room, sir.

49
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,537
He is curious about how Isadora
found the poison on her knife.

50
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:08,637
I will tell him that I was the one
who gave Isadore the poisoned knife...

51
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:13,204
...when his tongue swells and he will not
be able to talk in a few days.

52
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,337
You can go now, doctor.

53
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:32,304
Grandmaster Petruchio
will die in a few days.

54
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,870
The Council members
will elect a new grandmaster.

55
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:40,204
Who will the new grandmaster be, Cardinal?

56
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:42,237
Titus, of course.

57
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:47,670
Tell Titus to secretly
come and visit me tonight.

58
00:21:52,004 --> 00:21:55,970
When will you bring Ibn al-Arabi's relic?

59
00:21:57,404 --> 00:21:59,570
I will visit him tomorrow.

60
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:02,270
Good. Bring it as soon as possible.

61
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,937
I want to take the Shahzade...

62
00:22:04,004 --> 00:22:07,604
...and get away from this
ominous place as soon as possible.

63
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:09,537
Do not worry, sir.

64
00:22:24,937 --> 00:22:26,770
My brave man.

65
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,637
My strong man.

66
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:34,437
Weapons, heroism and being a bey
befits you so much.

67
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:41,537
My moon-faced woman.

68
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,904
My life companion
who laughs and saddens with me.

69
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:52,837
Being a bey is a cloth made of fire.

70
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:57,204
Putting it on and off
are both tough ordeals.

71
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,837
You are right.

72
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:01,837
This marquee suffered so much.

73
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:04,604
There have been so many troubles.

74
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:11,370
Hayme, I thought about not coming back
to this marquee for a moment.

75
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,904
However, if he did not,
we would be obeying persecution.

76
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:23,737
If we did not struggle for the underdogs,
the pharaohs would have won.

77
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,504
Even one single breath
is too much for a persecutor.

78
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:31,337
You are right, Bey.

79
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,237
What will you do to Kurdoglu?

80
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,237
How he will end up is certain.

81
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,437
I only want to bring down the castle
on the Templars now.

82
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,470
Either that castle
will be destroyed, or us.

83
00:23:55,304 --> 00:23:57,537
Dundar?

84
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,470
Son?

85
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,370
Mother. Father.

86
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,670
Your mother would give her life
for you, my son!

87
00:24:08,737 --> 00:24:12,837
Thank God for this double joy.

88
00:24:24,204 --> 00:24:27,470
I was so scared that
we would not get together again.

89
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,570
What would I do
if anything happened to you?

90
00:24:42,337 --> 00:24:46,270
What protects a person from death
is their determined time of death.

91
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:52,670
See, we could come together again.

92
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:55,970
Thank God.

93
00:24:58,403 --> 00:24:59,903
What is going to happen now?

94
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:07,903
First, Kurdoglu will be punished
like the way he deserves.

95
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:13,737
And then, those Templars' castle
will be brought down on them.

96
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,970
Gazelle eyes.

97
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:34,604
May sadness, grief and sorrow
be away from us.

98
00:25:41,004 --> 00:25:42,504
My brave man.

99
00:25:43,737 --> 00:25:47,204
Neither sadness,
nor grief or sorrow for us...

100
00:25:51,704 --> 00:25:53,604
It is time for the meeting.

101
00:25:54,604 --> 00:25:58,637
What happened to "The hunt is ours,
and the meeting is theirs"?

102
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,870
I am the one who is given duty now.

103
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,537
They are both ours.

104
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,537
Life without you was a dungeon for me.

105
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:52,337
Your love gave me life
in those dungeons, Aykiz.

106
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,504
Let us come together now, Turgut.

107
00:27:00,604 --> 00:27:03,937
I do not have strength
to bear even one more day.

108
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,704
Let us talk to your father and our Bey...

109
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,470
...and get married as soon as possible.

110
00:27:31,437 --> 00:27:32,904
Turgut...

111
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,704
Turgut...

112
00:27:34,837 --> 00:27:36,570
Turgut...

113
00:27:36,637 --> 00:27:39,004
We will get rid of this plague.

114
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,904
We will get rid of it.

115
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:48,704
If...

116
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,570
If I attempt to hurt you unknowingly...

117
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:02,237
Take this dagger.

118
00:28:03,204 --> 00:28:04,737
Kill me.

119
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,804
You are scared that I would talk,
are you not?

120
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,937
That I would turn you in.

121
00:29:11,004 --> 00:29:15,870
Would I not have thanked them
for killing me, if I did that?

122
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:21,837
I want to leave the biggest plague
as legacy to Suleyman and his children.

123
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:27,270
And my biggest fortune,
my biggest legacy is you.

124
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:41,237
By the name of the 99 names of God...

125
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:46,204
...who creates everything with only one
word and fills our hearts with faith.

126
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:55,204
Beys, I suffered a lot
during this last period of my life.

127
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,404
I lost my children and my first wife.

128
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:04,204
So many of my brothers
died in my arms.

129
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:10,637
However, none of these hurt me
as much as this last betrayal did.

130
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:18,437
That traitor overthrew me with tricks.

131
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,770
He defamed my woman,
my children and my sister-in-law.

132
00:31:25,737 --> 00:31:27,337
He tortured them.

133
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:31,804
But the beys of the headquarters
did not say anything!

134
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:35,870
They did not stand straight
against the persecutor!

135
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:41,237
Why is that?

136
00:31:41,337 --> 00:31:42,970
Why is that?

137
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,804
Forgive us, Bey.

138
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,770
Kurdoglu deceived us.

139
00:31:49,837 --> 00:31:55,404
Then, I will not arrange headquarters
meetings with beys who were deceived.

140
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:00,737
All of you are dismissed!

141
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,670
We will have new beys here.

142
00:32:27,637 --> 00:32:29,704
Ertugrul...

143
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,637
Kurdoglu's duties are yours.

144
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:36,604
Gundogdu...

145
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,204
Provision of food is your duty.

146
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,337
Now, bring Kurdoglu here!

147
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,277
You have long since
deserved to die, Kurtoglu.

148
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:12,277
No one will ever trust you now.

149
00:33:12,343 --> 00:33:14,277
You are going to die.

150
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:22,143
Your punishment was determined, Kurtoglu.

151
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,277
Thank God.

152
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:37,977
Peace is upon our people now!

153
00:33:39,277 --> 00:33:40,677
We got rid of this trouble, too.

154
00:33:41,377 --> 00:33:44,677
Now, it is time to arrange your weddings.

155
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:51,177
With permission of our father...

156
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:54,177
...we do not want to have
a wedding ceremony, mother.

157
00:33:58,877 --> 00:34:01,010
The war against the Templars
is inevitable now.

158
00:34:01,677 --> 00:34:03,077
We are all aware of it.

159
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,877
If God permits,
we want to have our ceremonies...

160
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:08,810
...after the war.

161
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,043
When our men...

162
00:34:11,877 --> 00:34:13,210
...and my brother, Yigit...

163
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,577
...return home safely.

164
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:25,843
Just like Halime Sultan says,

165
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:31,310
Suleyman Shah, Ertugrul Bey, Gundogdu Bey

166
00:34:32,043 --> 00:34:34,810
will never come back
before they demolish their castles.

167
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:41,910
If they can not return home safely,

168
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:48,777
we will, at least, have the honor
to lead a life as their widows.

169
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,277
With our father's consent,

170
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,910
we would like to exchange vows
before the war breaks out.

171
00:35:03,577 --> 00:35:09,610
Oh, my beautiful girls!
You are as brave as your men!

172
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,743
May God bless you!

173
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,910
We went all through this
because of that dog, named Kurtoglu.

174
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:25,777
We have seen his men die
one after another.

175
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,777
Now, it is his time to pay.

176
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,210
Just after he is punished,

177
00:35:31,177 --> 00:35:34,943
I will convey your requests
to our Suleyman Shah.

178
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:37,677
Agreed?

179
00:35:38,243 --> 00:35:39,377
We appreciate, mother.

180
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,710
Some of his men may still be alive.

181
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:48,577
Who knows?
There may be others who share his sins.

182
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,210
He will have to confess
in the headquarters.

183
00:35:54,143 --> 00:35:55,343
May God protect us!

184
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,943
-Traitor!
-Hang him!

185
00:37:37,343 --> 00:37:38,577
Kurtoglu!

186
00:37:39,643 --> 00:37:42,110
Do you have something to say?

187
00:37:49,177 --> 00:37:52,977
I spent my life rushing from one battle
to another for our nomad group.

188
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:57,077
I lost everything I had,

189
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,210
my sons, my wife,

190
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:02,810
while fighting for our people.

191
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:11,610
I did everything to enlarge our boundaries
and strengthen our nomad group.

192
00:38:12,177 --> 00:38:14,977
To have our own lands
and found a seigniory.

193
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,877
I want these to be taken
into consideration, Bey.

194
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:26,210
You have ruined your bravery
with treachery, Kurtoglu.

195
00:38:27,777 --> 00:38:29,743
There are no excuses for treachery

196
00:38:30,877 --> 00:38:33,243
and it must be punished by death.

197
00:38:36,843 --> 00:38:40,710
It appears that you have learned
to confess sins from Templars, Kurtoglu.

198
00:38:42,577 --> 00:38:45,043
Yet, this is no place
to confess your sins.

199
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:54,310
I demand a punishment
that will not ruin my dignity, Bey!

200
00:38:56,143 --> 00:39:00,943
How can you still
speak of dignity, traitor?

201
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,010
Beys! I demand mercy!

202
00:39:08,243 --> 00:39:11,177
Show mercy! Please!

203
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,777
You'll be shown mercy
just as much as you did, Kurtoglu.

204
00:39:20,377 --> 00:39:23,710
You will be shown
as much mercy as you showed

205
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:26,743
to Alps you have slaughtered
with Karatoygar and Titus.

206
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:30,843
Kurtoglu!

207
00:39:31,943 --> 00:39:37,010
You are guilty of betraying
your people, Bey.

208
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:39,910
You have violated religion and traditions.

209
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,310
You are sentenced to death.

210
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,177
Take this traitor out.

211
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:07,243
Bey! I demand mercy!

212
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,810
Bey! For the sake of our past!

213
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:17,077
Send me to dark dungeons but...

214
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:19,977
...spare my life.

215
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,143
Spare my life, Bey!

216
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,377
Spare my life!

217
00:40:27,277 --> 00:40:31,710
Bey! Spare my life.

218
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:33,710
Spare my life!

219
00:40:34,843 --> 00:40:35,877
Spare my life!

220
00:40:39,243 --> 00:40:40,377
Spare my life, Bey!

221
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,343
Spare my life!

222
00:40:55,377 --> 00:40:57,177
-Kill him!

223
00:40:58,143 --> 00:41:00,810
-Murderer!
-He murdered our sons!

224
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:05,210
-Traitor!

225
00:42:30,777 --> 00:42:37,710
We promised to die for each other
while becoming blood brothers.

226
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:42,043
We promised not to use our swords
against one another.

227
00:42:44,377 --> 00:42:46,343
I am going to keep my promise.

228
00:42:47,977 --> 00:42:50,243
Because I keep my words.

229
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,277
I am not going to take your life.

230
00:44:34,577 --> 00:44:36,743
I bear witness that
there is no god but Allah

231
00:44:36,943 --> 00:44:40,310
and Muhammad is the servant
and Messenger of Allah.

232
00:44:43,377 --> 00:44:45,143
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

233
00:45:16,877 --> 00:45:18,877
God!

234
00:45:20,077 --> 00:45:24,643
-Allahu akbar!
-Divine Justice...

235
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:26,710
From now on,

236
00:46:26,777 --> 00:46:31,143
none can stand against our next

237
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:34,743
and the biggest crusade.

238
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,043
Cardinal Thomas finished the report

239
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:44,777
that he has been preparing for Pope
and the Frederick, the Emperor.

240
00:46:46,077 --> 00:46:48,343
His report is beyond our expectations.

241
00:46:50,243 --> 00:46:54,577
He mentions our efforts with praise.

242
00:46:56,243 --> 00:47:02,343
I propose a toast to you,
to the precious knights of our cult.

243
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,677
Welcome back!

244
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,610
What about Kayi tribe?

245
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,577
Do you think that we have not heard of
what the Turk, named Ertugrul did

246
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:52,643
and you cannot fight him back properly,
Master Petruchio?

247
00:47:54,077 --> 00:47:59,077
We have heard of how he uncovered
our intelligence network in Aleppo

248
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:04,977
and how he slaughtered tons of our spies
and brave knights like animals.

249
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:11,843
Master Ricardo!
Please you all tell me this.

250
00:48:12,243 --> 00:48:18,010
Did his apostles give up fighting
after Jesus was crucified?

251
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:25,910
I am sure you are all aware that
you have to face unforeseen obstacles

252
00:48:25,977 --> 00:48:29,310
while marching to your destination.

253
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,943
How can we trust you, Master Petruchio?

254
00:48:38,277 --> 00:48:43,277
How can we believe in your word...

255
00:48:43,343 --> 00:48:47,310
...after all these defeats.

256
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:20,010
As Salam Alaykum
wa Rahmatullah.

257
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:21,977
As Salam Alaykum
wa Rahmatullah.

258
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:29,677
God, give me strength!

259
00:49:30,277 --> 00:49:34,710
Take my life but do not let them
hold me captive like my brother, Turgut.

260
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,610
Cardinal Thomas summons you.

261
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:53,243
Go tell that daemon
that I don't want to see him!

262
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:59,710
Don't make me hurt you, young boy!

263
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:23,010
He should have got this job done

264
00:50:23,077 --> 00:50:25,843
when we captured Ertugrul
and his Alps in the forest.

265
00:50:26,377 --> 00:50:29,277
Unfortunately, it was a big mistake.

266
00:50:30,377 --> 00:50:34,610
I don't know what Arabi's relic is

267
00:50:34,677 --> 00:50:39,043
but he destroyed ours to gather it.

268
00:50:39,377 --> 00:50:42,143
Master Petruchio must pay for it.

269
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:46,210
You have to regain the dignity

270
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:49,310
that your cult lost
in Antioch and Aleppo, Titus.

271
00:50:50,243 --> 00:50:52,310
I trust you can achieve it
with all my heart.

272
00:50:57,043 --> 00:51:02,010
Do you have any idea about
how Isadora found that poisonous knife?

273
00:51:02,577 --> 00:51:05,777
It is God's divine justice, my son.

274
00:51:06,343 --> 00:51:09,010
Divine justice.

275
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,110
Come in!

276
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:18,910
Welcome, Shahzada!

277
00:51:22,977 --> 00:51:24,643
What do you want from me?

278
00:51:24,843 --> 00:51:30,577
I just wanted to discuss why you need
to come to Constantinople with me.

279
00:51:30,643 --> 00:51:32,577
I will never be in your service.

280
00:51:34,677 --> 00:51:39,277
Great emperors never serve
to anyone, Shahzada!

281
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:42,577
And you will be a great emperor.

282
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:08,043
Dundar Bey!

283
00:52:08,377 --> 00:52:10,877
You are eating like a hungry wolf.

284
00:52:11,643 --> 00:52:13,210
We have been away for a long time.

285
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:16,843
Let's act like a wolf so that
friends and foes see that I am back.

286
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:21,643
Dundar Bey!
People say you almost ate the Templars.

287
00:52:24,177 --> 00:52:26,143
Boar meat is not halal to us, brother.

288
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,843
Almighty! We are grateful
for all your blessings.

289
00:52:39,943 --> 00:52:41,877
You reunited us.

290
00:52:42,877 --> 00:52:46,610
You protected our home, our nomad camp
from the evil of the enemies.

291
00:52:47,643 --> 00:52:49,843
We appreciate.

292
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,843
-Amen.
-Amen.

293
00:52:53,143 --> 00:52:57,010
Ertugrul! We need to gather
the nomad group immediately.

294
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:00,610
You're right, brother.

295
00:53:01,343 --> 00:53:04,777
Our people are disorganized.
We need to provide order.

296
00:53:06,077 --> 00:53:08,243
We will achieve it
with the help of God.

297
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,310
No one can stand in our way.

298
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,710
However, first things first.

299
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:16,877
You and Halime Sultan
need to get married.

300
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,043
Let me get some water!

301
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:50,777
-I can get some for you, mother!
-No, I got it.

302
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:06,910
Gokce!

303
00:54:11,777 --> 00:54:13,210
Yes, mother!
Do you need something?

304
00:54:18,377 --> 00:54:21,843
My beautiful Gokce. My sunshine!

305
00:54:28,077 --> 00:54:30,643
Mother, please forgive me!

306
00:54:31,277 --> 00:54:32,910
I can't resist him!

307
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:37,043
My heart hurts!
I just can't.

308
00:54:44,843 --> 00:54:46,277
My beautiful daughter.

309
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:51,177
You are destined to suffer from it.

310
00:54:52,343 --> 00:54:55,277
With permission of God,
you will find a man who loves you.

311
00:54:56,143 --> 00:55:00,077
And you will love him deeply, too.

312
00:55:04,377 --> 00:55:07,310
Come on!
Wipe your tears.

313
00:55:42,943 --> 00:55:44,243
Thank God!

314
00:55:48,143 --> 00:55:49,143
So?

315
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:53,877
I had told you my beautiful daughter.

316
00:55:53,943 --> 00:55:57,743
We get through these cloudy days.
We fight our troubles away.

317
00:55:57,977 --> 00:56:02,843
Don't be afraid of the winter,
Flowers bloom when the spring arrives.

318
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,677
Didn't I tell you that
the day follows the night?

319
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:08,143
Thank God, father.

320
00:56:09,977 --> 00:56:12,210
Thank God.

321
00:56:16,177 --> 00:56:17,743
My children!

322
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,777
I am so close
to the end of my mortal life.

323
00:56:23,843 --> 00:56:28,377
I wish to see you married
before I pass away.

324
00:56:30,843 --> 00:56:33,210
But things are very complicated
these days.

325
00:56:34,577 --> 00:56:36,243
We can't afford a wedding ceremony.

326
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:44,943
We were just planning
to ask for your permission, father.

327
00:56:47,343 --> 00:56:49,077
Thanks be to God.

328
00:56:50,177 --> 00:56:51,910
Thanks be to God.

329
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:54,677
Thanks be to God.

330
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:56,810
Turgut?

331
00:56:56,877 --> 00:56:58,777
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

332
00:56:58,843 --> 00:56:59,943
My son.

333
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,943
-Turgut!
-Take my hand.

334
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:05,010
-Father?
-Give us some water.

335
00:57:05,077 --> 00:57:06,343
Bring water.

336
00:57:06,577 --> 00:57:09,310
Turgut?

337
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:12,743
Drink some.

338
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,210
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

339
00:57:20,977 --> 00:57:22,910
Open your eyes, my son.
Open your eyes.

340
00:57:22,977 --> 00:57:24,677
Father, what are we going to do?

341
00:57:53,377 --> 00:57:56,210
Bey! Turgut is having an attack.
He is in Otacı's tent.

342
00:57:58,877 --> 00:57:59,877
Excuse me, Bey!

343
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:07,177
Elhamdulillah!

344
00:58:08,177 --> 00:58:11,177
Elhamdulillah for everything
you send, my God.

345
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:32,843
His body reacted because he hasn't taken
Templars' poison for a long time.

346
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,077
Is he going to be okay?

347
00:58:59,043 --> 00:59:00,243
What happened?

348
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,277
His body needs Templars' elixir.

349
00:59:04,177 --> 00:59:06,943
He has resisted to take it
for a long time.

350
00:59:09,577 --> 00:59:12,877
But, his body can't resist it any more.

351
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:23,910
-What do we need to do, then?
-Shall we give him some if necessary?

352
00:59:26,643 --> 00:59:29,643
He will always need it
if we give him some more.

353
00:59:30,177 --> 00:59:34,577
And, he will be closer to death each day.
We need to be patient.

354
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:44,110
God will be in his aid
with his name, El Shafi.

355
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,877
God help him.

356
00:59:50,843 --> 00:59:55,243
We've done everything that we can.
Now, it is time to wait.

357
01:00:24,677 --> 01:00:28,843
We found our brother but this sickness
wants to take him apart from us again.

358
01:00:30,677 --> 01:00:32,677
These Templars are so coward.

359
01:00:33,243 --> 01:00:36,010
They rely on poison
as they are too coward to fight.

360
01:00:36,343 --> 01:00:40,310
They are everywhere.
They are full of tricks.

361
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:45,677
Their power comes from Muslims' weakness.

362
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,943
They are wicked cats
seeing lions in the mirror.

363
01:00:50,877 --> 01:00:52,177
They try to spread fear.

364
01:00:54,077 --> 01:00:57,310
But they could not defeat us
and they won't be able to.

365
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:02,877
If they are everywhere, so are we.

366
01:01:10,577 --> 01:01:15,143
Brothers! Can you excuse me
to have a word with Afsin Bey?

367
01:01:34,143 --> 01:01:35,910
I am all ears, Ertugrul Bey.

368
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,777
Now tell me who you are, Afsin Bey!

369
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:43,343
Where did you come from?
And, why are you here?

370
01:01:44,843 --> 01:01:48,043
I was in Ahlat with the elderly.

371
01:01:49,243 --> 01:01:53,277
Ertugrul Bey, Turkish tribes and states
have been born and grown

372
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:56,010
in the hands of the elderly
ever since the Oghuz Khan.

373
01:01:56,077 --> 01:01:58,010
This will stay the same in the future.

374
01:01:59,243 --> 01:02:03,943
Ahlat is our gateway to Anatolia
and the elderly stay there.

375
01:02:05,343 --> 01:02:09,210
-I have a message from them for you.
-What is it?

376
01:02:09,377 --> 01:02:14,710
Mongolians are getting stronger.
We must gather all Oghuz tribes together.

377
01:02:14,777 --> 01:02:18,610
They ask you to take
the Kayi tribe back to Anatolia.

378
01:02:20,577 --> 01:02:26,210
-Does my father know the elderly?
-It's a rare opportunity, Ertugrul Bey.

379
01:02:27,943 --> 01:02:32,143
-I wish to know them.
-It is only possible if they wish.

380
01:02:33,377 --> 01:02:36,643
We have to move the Kayi tribe
to Anatolia as soon as possible.

381
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:39,310
Mongolians are approaching
like a raged bull.

382
01:02:41,877 --> 01:02:44,843
We need soldiers to stop them.

383
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:09,110
Your slit black eyes now taken by sleep.

384
01:03:11,243 --> 01:03:12,277
Let them open.

385
01:03:16,277 --> 01:03:19,043
Your twelve healthy bones
have been broken.

386
01:03:20,977 --> 01:03:22,077
Let them heal.

387
01:03:27,877 --> 01:03:32,710
Your soul all but flown from your frame.

388
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,810
Let it return.

389
01:03:38,977 --> 01:03:43,310
If your body retains any life,
let me know.

390
01:03:44,843 --> 01:03:47,910
Let my poor luckless head
be a sacrifice to you.

391
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:56,643
Kazilik Mountain, your waters still flow;
Let them, I pray, cease their flowing.

392
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:06,110
Kazilik Mountain, your grasses still grow;
Let them, I pray, cease their growing.

393
01:04:09,177 --> 01:04:13,843
Kazilik Mountain,
your deer still run fast.

394
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:16,277
Let them cease running,

395
01:04:18,177 --> 01:04:19,877
and turn into stone.

396
01:04:22,577 --> 01:04:28,043
How can I know, my son,
if it was lion or a tiger?

397
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:30,810
How can I know, my son?

398
01:04:32,877 --> 01:04:36,610
How did this accident happen to you?

399
01:04:38,677 --> 01:04:43,377
If your life is still in your body,
my son, let me know.

400
01:04:46,677 --> 01:04:49,143
Let my poor luckless head
be a sacrifice to you.

401
01:04:51,377 --> 01:04:55,043
Speak a few words to me now.

402
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:37,177
Bismillah. Good appetite.

403
01:06:50,077 --> 01:06:56,177
-Visit the loom to check the girls today.
-Sure.

404
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:06,810
We should give Gokce in marriage soon
so that she forgets about Ertugrul.

405
01:07:07,943 --> 01:07:08,977
You are right, Bey.

406
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:16,177
Are you okay, Hatun?

407
01:07:18,377 --> 01:07:19,877
Why are you asking, Bey?

408
01:07:20,777 --> 01:07:22,877
You act like an angel this morning.

409
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:25,777
I tell you to go to the loom
and you don't reject.

410
01:07:26,577 --> 01:07:29,377
I tell you we should give Gokce
in marriage, no objections.

411
01:07:29,677 --> 01:07:30,677
What's going on?

412
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:33,810
Whatever you wish, Bey!

413
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:39,310
My Goodness. So weird.

414
01:07:39,377 --> 01:07:41,310
The world is falling apart.

415
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:24,843
-Long live, Bey!
-Thank you.

416
01:08:30,577 --> 01:08:33,143
-Bey.
-Oh, Wild Demir.

417
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:37,043
-Thank God, we have reached good days.
-Thank God.

418
01:08:37,677 --> 01:08:43,577
-How is Turgut Alp?
-Fine, Bey. Nothing to do but to wait.

419
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:51,643
Bey, should you accept to listen,
I would like to tell you something.

420
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:56,677
I want Turgut and Aykiz to get married.

421
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:59,710
They have been waiting far too long.

422
01:08:59,877 --> 01:09:03,143
I am also aware that it is not
the greatest time for a wedding,

423
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:05,377
considering we have a lot of problems.

424
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:07,377
You are right!

425
01:09:07,843 --> 01:09:09,877
Our kids are in misery.

426
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:13,643
We get it done as soon as
Turgut Alp recovers.

427
01:09:14,243 --> 01:09:15,743
May God bless you, Bey.

428
01:09:34,377 --> 01:09:36,277
As Salam Alaykum
wa Rahmatullah.

429
01:09:37,077 --> 01:09:39,077
As Salam Alaykum
wa Rahmatullah.

430
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:42,943
May I come in, Sheik?

431
01:09:44,777 --> 01:09:45,810
Of course, my daughter!

432
01:09:56,077 --> 01:09:58,677
I want to talk to you
if you care to listen.

433
01:09:59,577 --> 01:10:00,910
Sure! Please be seated.

434
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,910
Efendi! I did bad things.

435
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:26,043
I harmed a lot of people
and acted evil.

436
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:30,577
I'd like to retreat
from my sins and repent.

437
01:10:31,877 --> 01:10:34,343
God's doors for repentance
are always wide open.

438
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:39,177
Beg God for forgiveness
and acceptance of your repentance.

439
01:10:40,877 --> 01:10:45,910
However, you say you harmed people.

440
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:51,310
You must talk to them
and demand forgiveness.

441
01:10:53,943 --> 01:10:57,577
Do not pass away
before you ask for forgiveness.

442
01:10:58,943 --> 01:11:02,143
Because God does not forgive
one another's rights.

443
01:11:09,377 --> 01:11:13,777
My dear sisters!
We  finally have peace among our people.

444
01:11:14,643 --> 01:11:16,977
Now it is time for us to work hard.

445
01:11:17,677 --> 01:11:19,177
Bismillah!

446
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:23,843
Halime, my daughter!
You are responsible for the prints.

447
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:26,977
You must search meadows,
find beautiful flowers,

448
01:11:27,043 --> 01:11:28,177
and extract their colors.

449
01:11:28,243 --> 01:11:32,210
Do not worry, Mother Hayme.
We will surely do our best.

450
01:11:32,743 --> 01:11:36,010
Gokce, my daughter.
You shall be checking the looms.

451
01:11:36,077 --> 01:11:38,743
We must get carpets ready
to be sold in Aleppo.

452
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:39,877
Sure, mother!

453
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:41,277
Take it easy, Hatuns.

454
01:11:41,743 --> 01:11:45,310
-Oh, welcome Bey.
-Thank you.

455
01:11:47,043 --> 01:11:50,210
-Please be seated, father.
-Thank you, I won't stay too long.

456
01:11:51,277 --> 01:11:53,177
I just wanted to see Bacis.

457
01:11:54,277 --> 01:11:57,210
So, Hayme Hatun?
How are things here?

458
01:11:58,143 --> 01:12:01,743
They have promised. Everything
will be ready for Aleppo Bazaar.

459
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:06,277
If God permits, Aleppo Bazaar will be
ornamented with Kayi Bacis' handcrafts.

460
01:12:06,343 --> 01:12:08,277
If God permits, Bey!

461
01:12:09,043 --> 01:12:13,010
Bey, we can get everything done
under your command.

462
01:12:13,377 --> 01:12:14,743
Thank you all, Bacis.

463
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:18,610
If you have complaints
about your husbands,

464
01:12:18,677 --> 01:12:22,143
you should know that
I am always ready to listen to you!

465
01:12:55,310 --> 01:12:58,877
-How are they doing?
-They are distracted, Bey.

466
01:12:58,943 --> 01:13:01,643
We must train them
to be Alps in no time.

467
01:13:04,977 --> 01:13:09,377
Alps seem to have forgotten how to fight
while electing Bey in the headquarters.

468
01:13:10,277 --> 01:13:14,210
Train them day and night
and get them ready to fight.

469
01:13:14,943 --> 01:13:16,010
As you wish, Bey.

470
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:19,710
-As you command, Bey
-May God give you strength.

471
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,143
God be with you, Alps.

472
01:13:37,077 --> 01:13:38,710
You have honored us, Bey.

473
01:13:42,777 --> 01:13:47,843
They are a bit distracted
because of Kurtoglu's promises, father!

474
01:13:49,943 --> 01:13:52,677
We will get our nomad group aligned.

475
01:13:54,277 --> 01:13:57,110
The threat from enemies
aids the unification.

476
01:13:57,943 --> 01:14:01,643
It makes us get closer
and keeps us alert.

477
01:14:02,743 --> 01:14:07,043
It covers our weaknesses!
Keep them in mind, son!

478
01:14:09,043 --> 01:14:14,043
Should you be the Bey one day,
always keep your nomads ready to fight.

479
01:14:49,877 --> 01:14:54,210
Thanks God, we have finally
seen a peaceful day.

480
01:14:54,277 --> 01:14:56,210
-Thanks God.
-Thanks God.

481
01:14:58,043 --> 01:15:03,377
Even though there are threats from
Templars, crusaders, and others,

482
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:08,710
it is important to have
peace at home.

483
01:15:09,077 --> 01:15:11,810
We are grateful to God
for his blessings.

484
01:15:11,877 --> 01:15:13,810
-Thanks God!
-Thanks God!

485
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:18,943
However, we are deeply
sorry for Turgut.

486
01:15:20,877 --> 01:15:23,310
If God permits,
we will see him recover.

487
01:15:24,277 --> 01:15:25,910
If God permits, father.

488
01:15:31,143 --> 01:15:36,910
I suggest that Turgut and Aykiz
shall get married first, Ertugrul.

489
01:15:37,677 --> 01:15:41,310
-They have waited for too long.
-I was gonna ask you the same, father.

490
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:45,110
I would also suggest that
they should get married first.

491
01:15:46,143 --> 01:15:48,910
We should be quick
with happy events.

492
01:15:52,343 --> 01:15:56,010
After all these sufferings
and with a broken heart,

493
01:15:56,610 --> 01:16:01,843
we should proceed with the engagement
even though Shahzada Yigit is a prisoner.

494
01:16:03,377 --> 01:16:09,743
We cherish our peace so that
we have strength against our enemies.

495
01:16:10,743 --> 01:16:12,177
-If God permits!
-If God permits!

496
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:13,977
Father!

497
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:18,110
I would like to have some words
with your permission.

498
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:26,377
To have peace in our marquee
and nomad tents,

499
01:16:27,077 --> 01:16:32,010
all secrets must be revealed, Bey.

500
01:16:35,077 --> 01:16:37,943
Selcan, what are you talking about?

501
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:43,777
Mother! To have peace
in the marquee of a...

502
01:16:43,843 --> 01:16:48,110
...sacred father and mother like yours.

503
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:54,277
You all need to know about my sins.

504
01:16:54,877 --> 01:16:58,110
Selcan, do you hear what you are saying?

505
01:17:00,277 --> 01:17:06,310
Gundogdu! I aborted our child
long before you knew of.

506
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:11,377
I was too scared to tell you.

507
01:17:12,877 --> 01:17:15,977
I did something even worse

508
01:17:16,043 --> 01:17:20,110
and claimed it was because of Aykiz.

509
01:17:21,377 --> 01:17:22,910
I blamed her for it.

510
01:17:22,977 --> 01:17:25,843
She was whipped
before the eyes of people.

511
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,710
Even though I knew Gokce was infertile,

512
01:17:32,077 --> 01:17:35,243
I made every effort to see her
married to Ertugrul Bey.

513
01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:42,577
What have you done, Selcan?

514
01:17:43,143 --> 01:17:46,243
I wish it were all about it, Bey.

515
01:17:46,977 --> 01:17:48,877
I did not stop.

516
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:53,877
I collaborated with that traitor,
named Kurtoglu

517
01:17:53,943 --> 01:17:57,310
and spoiled Gundogdu's soul
just to help him to be the Bey.

518
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:02,210
Although I knew that there might be
consequences for Gokce

519
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:06,277
and it might cost
my husband, Gundogdu's life...

520
01:18:08,577 --> 01:18:11,810
I am sinful in all these.

521
01:18:11,877 --> 01:18:13,810
Nothing less...

522
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:16,277
-Selcan, enough!
-Be seated.

523
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:22,910
Calm down! Be seated, son!
I want to hear what she says.

524
01:18:31,361 --> 01:18:33,528
I don't want my darkened and defiled soul

525
01:18:33,828 --> 01:18:38,728
to dishonor my husband's bed
and my parent's tent.

526
01:18:41,828 --> 01:18:44,861
I want you to punish me twofold
in the same way I treated did Aykiz.

527
01:18:46,761 --> 01:18:50,328
I must be punished equally as Kurdoglu.

528
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:56,528
I am grateful to Ibn Arabi
for not letting me kill myself

529
01:18:56,928 --> 01:19:01,694
out of grief and commit a bigger sin.

530
01:19:03,294 --> 01:19:05,494
He told me to tell you everything

531
01:19:06,294 --> 01:19:08,394
and so I did, without keeping any secrets.

532
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:11,594
I am ready for any punishment you see fit.

533
01:19:23,794 --> 01:19:27,694
Our beloved prophet, peace be upon him

534
01:19:28,694 --> 01:19:30,761
said in a hadith that

535
01:19:31,594 --> 01:19:33,694
all men are sinners

536
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:38,828
but the most favourables
among sinners are repentants.

537
01:19:40,394 --> 01:19:43,794
Selcan wants to repent in the Nasuh way.

538
01:19:45,394 --> 01:19:47,828
She regrets for those she had done before.

539
01:19:48,961 --> 01:19:51,228
She is determined
to renounce her sins immediately

540
01:19:51,794 --> 01:19:54,294
and not to repeat them in the future.

541
01:19:55,928 --> 01:19:59,828
Our beloved prophet, peace be upon him

542
01:20:00,528 --> 01:20:02,328
describes Nasuh repentance as

543
01:20:03,794 --> 01:20:06,794
regretting all your sins,

544
01:20:08,828 --> 01:20:12,361
fully committing yourself to God
and never going back to your sins.

545
01:20:12,594 --> 01:20:16,394
Just like the milk, which never returns
to the breast once it flows.

546
01:20:23,894 --> 01:20:27,794
Selcan submits to any punishment
you decide.

547
01:20:29,294 --> 01:20:32,794
When all secrets were about to be covered
under a veil of lies

548
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:40,594
Selcan chose to confide her sins
instead of covering them up.

549
01:20:42,494 --> 01:20:45,628
I advice you to listen to her pure heart.

550
01:20:59,994 --> 01:21:01,628
Let Gundogdu decide.

551
01:21:44,694 --> 01:21:47,628
I went to bed with you as my woman!

552
01:21:49,528 --> 01:21:50,994
How could you do this to me?

553
01:21:57,461 --> 01:21:59,261
I gave into temptation, Gundogdu.

554
01:22:00,461 --> 01:22:02,294
Forgive me for God's sake.

555
01:22:02,894 --> 01:22:04,028
Forgive me!

556
01:22:07,394 --> 01:22:08,661
Get up, get up.

557
01:22:10,761 --> 01:22:16,694
I went against my mother and
father for you.

558
01:22:17,261 --> 01:22:18,494
What have you done?

559
01:22:18,761 --> 01:22:21,694
You collaborated with that
traitor Kurdoglu.

560
01:22:22,294 --> 01:22:24,461
How can I forgive you? How?

561
01:22:39,728 --> 01:22:43,228
We wanted to have a baby!
We tried for years!

562
01:22:47,761 --> 01:22:49,294
How could you do this to us?

563
01:22:50,394 --> 01:22:53,028
God, oh my God! You...

564
01:22:54,294 --> 01:22:55,961
How could you do this

565
01:22:56,328 --> 01:22:58,861
to the baby inside of you
out of your greed and ambition?

566
01:23:05,694 --> 01:23:07,761
How am I supposed to take you in my bed
as my woman!

567
01:23:17,461 --> 01:23:19,994
You will leave this tent tomorrow!

568
01:23:21,694 --> 01:23:23,828
I will not go to bed with you
as my woman again!

569
01:23:24,394 --> 01:23:25,994
I am divorcing you!

570
01:23:26,361 --> 01:23:27,694
No! No!

571
01:23:27,994 --> 01:23:30,661
Please, kill me! Please, kill me
if you are going to say that word!

572
01:23:30,894 --> 01:23:33,694
Kill me if you would say it, Gundogdu!
Take it and kill me!

573
01:23:36,328 --> 01:23:37,628
Kill me!

574
01:23:39,261 --> 01:23:40,561
Kill me!

575
01:23:55,028 --> 01:23:56,561
Go to hell.

576
01:24:24,928 --> 01:24:26,361
Peace be upon you.

577
01:24:27,694 --> 01:24:29,361
And peace be upon you, Ertugrul.

578
01:24:35,328 --> 01:24:36,594
Is Turgut Alp well?

579
01:24:38,928 --> 01:24:40,661
He has always been well, son.

580
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:47,728
He always fought with the monsters
that wanted to take away his soul.

581
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:54,361
He was imprisoned within himself.
He was alone.

582
01:24:55,594 --> 01:24:59,228
He could never ask for help or guidance.

583
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:05,028
The conflict between him and his enemy
that wanted to take his soul was so strong

584
01:25:06,561 --> 01:25:11,628
he prayed to God, chanting his name
in the dungeon they put him.

585
01:25:12,528 --> 01:25:14,794
He has already been one of
the victors, my son.

586
01:25:15,761 --> 01:25:20,861
Now God will have mercy on him once again
as "The Healer" is one of his many names.

587
01:25:28,461 --> 01:25:31,561
I would like to talk to you about Omer.

588
01:25:51,594 --> 01:25:52,694
My daughter.

589
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:01,894
Are the rumours true, father?
Has Dundar really healed?

590
01:26:04,428 --> 01:26:06,894
He got up as if nothing has happened.

591
01:26:08,428 --> 01:26:10,428
He is like a blade quenched in water.

592
01:26:11,294 --> 01:26:13,728
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

593
01:26:14,694 --> 01:26:16,628
-Father.
-Tell me, my daugther.

594
01:26:17,294 --> 01:26:21,394
They say that the evil eye on the marquee
was lifted after Selcan's confession.

595
01:26:23,494 --> 01:26:25,528
Not only the one on our marquee

596
01:26:26,394 --> 01:26:28,661
but also the evil eye on our nomad tent
was lifted with God's will.

597
01:26:29,994 --> 01:26:31,594
Turgut will get better, too.

598
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,028
If God permits, father.

599
01:26:39,461 --> 01:26:42,394
What about her? What will they do to her?

600
01:26:43,894 --> 01:26:46,694
Can they forgive her
after all the harm she has done?

601
01:26:47,028 --> 01:26:49,261
Nobody knows what will happen,
my daughter.

602
01:26:50,328 --> 01:26:53,894
Thank God, Ibn Arabi is here,
if it wasn't for him...

603
01:26:55,761 --> 01:26:58,661
Gundogdu Bey's situation is
very difficult.

604
01:26:59,894 --> 01:27:01,861
Even thinking about it is agony.

605
01:27:02,561 --> 01:27:04,728
May God help them.
-Amen.

606
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:15,894
-How is Turgut?
-He is the same, my Bey.

607
01:27:31,894 --> 01:27:33,028
Bey.

608
01:27:36,028 --> 01:27:37,294
My lad.

609
01:27:39,661 --> 01:27:40,794
My brother.

610
01:27:44,461 --> 01:27:46,594
Turgut, my son.

611
01:27:51,961 --> 01:27:53,294
Aykiz.

612
01:27:57,928 --> 01:27:59,694
Thank God for his mercy.

613
01:28:18,428 --> 01:28:20,294
I will leave tonight with your permission.

614
01:28:25,894 --> 01:28:27,294
If you are still alive

615
01:28:28,661 --> 01:28:30,628
know that it is thanks to Arabi.

616
01:28:34,494 --> 01:28:35,961
Do whatever you want.

617
01:28:37,661 --> 01:28:39,361
Be away from me and closer to God.

618
01:29:08,661 --> 01:29:09,728
Sister.

619
01:29:25,728 --> 01:29:27,528
Don't you hate me?

620
01:29:32,361 --> 01:29:33,728
You were my mother...

621
01:29:35,728 --> 01:29:38,461
...father and sister.

622
01:29:41,361 --> 01:29:42,728
You were everything to me.

623
01:29:45,428 --> 01:29:47,894
But I feel like you ripped
everything away from me.

624
01:29:51,528 --> 01:29:54,728
I lost Ertugrul. I lost my heart.

625
01:30:00,761 --> 01:30:02,794
Yet you killed a human being
inside of you.

626
01:30:15,694 --> 01:30:17,261
My dear sister.

627
01:30:19,561 --> 01:30:20,761
Gokce.

628
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:10,594
Don't you still trust me?
What kind of a stubbornness is that, Alps?

629
01:31:13,394 --> 01:31:15,794
I do not know what you said
to convince Ertugrul Bey.

630
01:31:17,661 --> 01:31:19,261
But you cannot convince me.

631
01:31:21,428 --> 01:31:24,728
Even your stubbornness is nice.
I cannot get mad at you.

632
01:31:26,994 --> 01:31:28,361
But...

633
01:31:30,461 --> 01:31:32,428
...I don't know what do you have
against me, Dogan?

634
01:31:33,761 --> 01:31:35,261
I do not trust you, Afsin Bey.

635
01:31:36,694 --> 01:31:39,894
I trust Selcan Hatun
but I do not trust you.

636
01:31:41,861 --> 01:31:46,561
She confessed everything one by one
out of regret.

637
01:31:48,228 --> 01:31:49,528
But you are not like her.

638
01:31:50,294 --> 01:31:53,361
I am afraid that some day
you will bring us together with Titus

639
01:31:54,228 --> 01:31:56,294
claiming that he is
important to the state.

640
01:31:58,794 --> 01:32:05,228
You showed up when our nomad group was in
deep trouble.

641
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:09,328
But heaven knows why

642
01:32:09,561 --> 01:32:12,861
Halime Sultan's father was murdered
after couple of days.

643
01:32:14,761 --> 01:32:15,928
You were nowhere to be found.

644
01:32:23,661 --> 01:32:25,661
Dogan, Bamsi.

645
01:32:29,994 --> 01:32:33,861
Afsin Bey has my and Ertugrul Bey's
full confidence.

646
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:39,794
You know that he was an
important commander in Seljuk Empire.

647
01:32:41,628 --> 01:32:43,661
We do not want bad blood between you.

648
01:32:44,661 --> 01:32:49,294
Besides, Suleyman Shah asked him
to come with us. Do I make myself clear?

649
01:32:50,561 --> 01:32:51,794
I understood, my Bey.

650
01:32:53,794 --> 01:32:57,028
Not quite, but so be it, my Bey.

651
01:32:58,828 --> 01:32:59,961
Alright then.

652
01:33:01,028 --> 01:33:02,394
Where is Ertugrul?

653
01:33:03,428 --> 01:33:05,861
He went to visit Turgut Alp.
He will be back soon.

654
01:33:13,428 --> 01:33:14,494
How is Turgut?

655
01:33:15,328 --> 01:33:16,861
Thank God, he woke up.

656
01:33:17,728 --> 01:33:18,861
Shall we?

657
01:34:10,528 --> 01:34:11,728
Do you have time, mother?

658
01:34:13,661 --> 01:34:14,794
Yes, Selcan.

659
01:34:16,728 --> 01:34:18,628
Gundogdu cast me out from his tent.

660
01:34:19,794 --> 01:34:21,494
I will look for another tent.

661
01:34:23,228 --> 01:34:24,928
You should be thankful
that he did not divorce you.

662
01:34:28,294 --> 01:34:29,861
Can Gokce stay with you?

663
01:34:30,961 --> 01:34:35,394
Please do not judge my sister by my deeds.

664
01:34:35,994 --> 01:34:40,361
We know what to see in a person very well.
Don't worry about it.

665
01:34:40,828 --> 01:34:42,761
Come on, sisters! Hurry up!

666
01:34:44,928 --> 01:34:47,594
Water is boiling!
Throw in the flowers! Hurry!

667
01:35:24,728 --> 01:35:26,961
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, Ertugrul Bey.

668
01:35:34,728 --> 01:35:37,261
Brother, meet Omer.

669
01:35:40,894 --> 01:35:45,494
Ibn Arabi said that he is a brave warrior
honored with Islam.

670
01:35:48,961 --> 01:35:50,694
-Welcome.
-I am honored.

671
01:35:53,794 --> 01:35:54,894
I am honored, Omer.

672
01:36:02,361 --> 01:36:06,928
Cardinal Thomas wants to take
Shahzade Yigit to Constantinople.

673
01:36:08,261 --> 01:36:10,561
I wanted to break him out of the dungeon

674
01:36:11,861 --> 01:36:13,594
but it was not possible.

675
01:36:15,661 --> 01:36:16,861
What about Isadora?

676
01:36:21,828 --> 01:36:24,428
Unfortunately, The Master killed her, too.

677
01:36:28,428 --> 01:36:29,561
She was a brave woman.

678
01:36:30,628 --> 01:36:33,328
I will avenge her father and sister.

679
01:36:36,828 --> 01:36:39,328
Cardinal will replace
The Master with Titus

680
01:36:39,561 --> 01:36:41,894
with the help of the
members of the council.

681
01:36:43,661 --> 01:36:48,994
Both of them do not want Kayi tribe
to get in their way before the Crusade.

682
01:36:50,694 --> 01:36:52,594
They will attack your nomad tribe.

683
01:36:55,661 --> 01:36:57,728
Will they cross the border
and attack the tribe?

684
01:36:58,328 --> 01:36:59,328
Yes.

685
01:37:04,628 --> 01:37:06,861
-May the faster one win.
-Exactly, brother.

686
01:37:08,261 --> 01:37:11,961
We should hurry up and
raze that castle to ground.

687
01:37:13,628 --> 01:37:16,294
Isadora drew everything we need
to get inside the castle.

688
01:37:17,428 --> 01:37:22,528
We know how to get inside the tunnels
and navigate through the castle.

689
01:37:23,661 --> 01:37:26,261
And most importantly,
you will be inside, Omer.

690
01:37:28,261 --> 01:37:29,561
Do not worry, my Bey.

691
01:37:30,494 --> 01:37:32,028
I will do whatever it takes.

692
01:37:50,028 --> 01:37:51,361
Have your fill, my son, eat.

693
01:37:54,894 --> 01:37:56,494
Mother, I will explode
if I take one more bite.

694
01:37:56,761 --> 01:37:58,994
Son, we have fed you
with water for months.

695
01:37:59,561 --> 01:38:02,394
Eat to put some muscle on you.
Eat, come on.

696
01:38:06,528 --> 01:38:09,394
He will be his mother's Alp, my brave son.

697
01:38:10,561 --> 01:38:12,828
Father, I would like to see the
new nomad tents with your permission.

698
01:38:15,794 --> 01:38:19,294
Alright son, you may go.
You would burn what you ate too.

699
01:38:19,528 --> 01:38:20,628
Thank you, father.

700
01:38:24,928 --> 01:38:30,228
Dundar, take it easy and
hold onto what you ate. Alright?

701
01:38:30,461 --> 01:38:33,394
Son, did you hear me?
-Alright, mother.

702
01:38:44,728 --> 01:38:47,661
Bey, what are we going to do about Selcan?

703
01:38:48,728 --> 01:38:50,794
Gundogdu told her to leave his tent.

704
01:38:51,728 --> 01:38:52,994
What did you say to him?

705
01:38:53,828 --> 01:38:58,594
I told him to give us some time
for things to settle down.

706
01:38:59,628 --> 01:39:00,928
What do you say?

707
01:39:02,394 --> 01:39:05,628
I don't know what to do
or what to say, Hayme.

708
01:39:08,294 --> 01:39:11,428
I do not know after all these years

709
01:39:12,794 --> 01:39:16,528
if we have been raising
a traitor or a dutiful child.

710
01:39:18,561 --> 01:39:22,294
I would have killed her in my marquee
if it was not for Ibn Arabi.

711
01:39:23,694 --> 01:39:25,261
I am not that merciful.

712
01:39:26,828 --> 01:39:32,628
Maybe she was behind everything
that happened to Turgut and Dundar.

713
01:39:35,828 --> 01:39:37,828
Gundogdu is devastated.

714
01:39:38,928 --> 01:39:40,728
He does not know what to do.

715
01:39:41,828 --> 01:39:44,628
Let us wait and hope for the best.

716
01:39:58,461 --> 01:39:59,761
You should rest, sir.

717
01:40:02,428 --> 01:40:04,361
I will represent you in the best way.

718
01:40:59,994 --> 01:41:00,994
Yes, Titus.

719
01:41:02,394 --> 01:41:04,694
What do you have to say about
the recent events?

720
01:41:05,928 --> 01:41:11,828
It was a very big mistake trying to banish
Kayi tribe to where they came from.

721
01:41:13,028 --> 01:41:15,894
We should have killed them all
when we had the chance.

722
01:41:16,728 --> 01:41:19,328
Do you have any suggestions, Knight Titus?

723
01:41:20,694 --> 01:41:22,261
Yes, I do.

724
01:41:24,928 --> 01:41:29,961
We will not rest until Kayi tribe
drowns in their own blood.

725
01:41:34,994 --> 01:41:39,528
They will perish to the last man,
including the babies in their cradles

726
01:41:41,461 --> 01:41:43,361
so that our sacred duty will come to life.

727
01:41:44,994 --> 01:41:48,961
What does Cardinal Thomas say about this?

728
01:41:53,361 --> 01:41:56,261
He would like to host you in his
chambers and discuss that matter.

729
01:41:59,494 --> 01:42:00,994
If you deem appropriate that is.

730
01:42:30,294 --> 01:42:32,894
Dogan. Tell Wild Demir
to come to the marquee.

731
01:42:33,594 --> 01:42:34,594
Yes, my Bey.

732
01:43:06,394 --> 01:43:07,828
Do you have any news from Omer?

733
01:43:10,528 --> 01:43:12,761
-Yes, my Bey.
-Good news?

734
01:43:14,661 --> 01:43:15,894
The news are not good, my Bey.

735
01:43:37,561 --> 01:43:39,594
Ertugrul Bey summons you
to the marquee, Wild Demir.

736
01:43:39,894 --> 01:43:42,894
-What is the matter?
-News are not good, Wild Demir.

737
01:43:53,461 --> 01:43:55,261
How is my brother, Aykiz?

738
01:44:37,594 --> 01:44:39,594
My dear friend, Petruchio.

739
01:44:40,961 --> 01:44:43,728
Such a great, divine man.

740
01:44:45,028 --> 01:44:50,894
But the crusaders need a young
and inspiring hero

741
01:44:51,594 --> 01:44:57,028
to rally us all around him instead of a
hero in deathbed like him.

742
01:44:58,228 --> 01:44:59,561
And that hero is...

743
01:45:01,394 --> 01:45:03,761
...Titus himself.

744
01:45:26,428 --> 01:45:28,228
That castle must be razed down
on the crusaders

745
01:45:28,394 --> 01:45:29,961
if we are going to ensure
our tribes future.

746
01:45:31,794 --> 01:45:33,228
There is no other way.

747
01:45:33,794 --> 01:45:37,994
They wanted to banish us from these
heavenly lands by using Kurdoglu.

748
01:45:38,528 --> 01:45:40,261
Thank God, they failed.

749
01:45:40,428 --> 01:45:44,461
From now on, their only goal
will be to kill us all.

750
01:45:46,894 --> 01:45:47,961
Wild Demir.

751
01:45:49,294 --> 01:45:54,928
Bey, I took a look at the drawings
Isadora brought.

752
01:45:57,028 --> 01:45:58,894
What you ask is possible.

753
01:45:59,694 --> 01:46:03,461
It can be done, but I do not know
how much it is going to take

754
01:46:03,628 --> 01:46:04,961
to open that blocked tunnels.

755
01:46:05,494 --> 01:46:06,994
If we are going to do this

756
01:46:07,628 --> 01:46:09,628
those in the castle
must be completely unaware of it.

757
01:46:10,461 --> 01:46:11,861
Is this possible, Ertugrul?

758
01:46:12,461 --> 01:46:15,561
If we lay siege to the castle,
we can do it.

759
01:46:16,228 --> 01:46:17,694
If we do it they cannot get out

760
01:46:17,961 --> 01:46:20,428
or send message to
their wretched brothers.

761
01:46:21,494 --> 01:46:22,794
While the castle is under siege

762
01:46:22,994 --> 01:46:25,728
we can dig the tunnels secretly
and infiltrate the castle.

763
01:46:38,794 --> 01:46:42,328
The number of our knights are not as much
as the Alps of Kayi tribe.

764
01:46:43,861 --> 01:46:46,628
A sudden raid will surely
provide us a big advantage

765
01:46:46,961 --> 01:46:50,594
but I don't want to put the war
in jeopardy.

766
01:46:52,828 --> 01:46:54,494
What are you suggesting, Titus?

767
01:46:57,794 --> 01:47:00,461
I will call for a legion
from Principality of Antioch.

768
01:47:01,294 --> 01:47:03,561
A legion of 800 archers

769
01:47:04,428 --> 01:47:07,594
will ease our cavaliers'
and footmens' work.

770
01:47:08,494 --> 01:47:10,561
I will also muster
300 knights from Cyprus.

771
01:47:13,228 --> 01:47:15,328
Where will you find the ships from, Titus?

772
01:47:16,628 --> 01:47:17,961
They are also ready, sir.

773
01:47:19,794 --> 01:47:22,294
I know that 15 galiots
Emperor Frederick sent

774
01:47:23,028 --> 01:47:24,961
are located at the Kyrenian Harbor.

775
01:47:25,994 --> 01:47:27,961
The navarch is going to do
what is necessary.

776
01:47:28,961 --> 01:47:32,594
The ships will be in Alexandretta
in a week.

777
01:47:42,261 --> 01:47:43,928
There are cliffs at the backside
of the castle, Bey.

778
01:47:44,394 --> 01:47:46,028
Access is possible only through the front.

779
01:47:46,528 --> 01:47:48,694
Accesses to the tunnels are
from the left and right sides.

780
01:47:59,594 --> 01:48:01,261
If we surround the castle...

781
01:48:03,428 --> 01:48:07,394
...from here and here, we have a chance
to get in from the tunnels.

782
01:48:12,694 --> 01:48:14,594
Can we get inside of this castle,
Wild Demir?

783
01:48:15,961 --> 01:48:19,761
Bey, I need to see the tunnels
with my own eyes.

784
01:48:21,228 --> 01:48:24,394
You and Afsin go and take a look
at the castle.

785
01:48:26,861 --> 01:48:27,961
Yes, my Bey.

786
01:48:29,394 --> 01:48:30,528
Ertugrul...

787
01:48:31,928 --> 01:48:33,928
...we must prepare our Alps for battle.

788
01:48:35,028 --> 01:48:37,461
They are probably preparing
to attack us, too.

789
01:48:38,961 --> 01:48:40,761
Reinforce the defences of the tribe also.

790
01:48:44,828 --> 01:48:47,028
You want us to be ready for
attack and defence, Bey.

791
01:48:49,228 --> 01:48:52,861
Gundogdu, you will try to find
coin for the battle.

792
01:48:53,994 --> 01:48:57,328
We need gold for weapons and subsistence.

793
01:48:58,228 --> 01:49:01,528
We can get the necessary weapons
with the gold we found in the tents

794
01:49:01,861 --> 01:49:03,528
of Kurdoglu and his Beys, father.

795
01:49:04,594 --> 01:49:07,894
Our goal will be to kill them all
using their own gold.

796
01:49:11,994 --> 01:49:13,528
May God grant us victory.

797
01:49:14,361 --> 01:49:15,861
The war has begun.

798
01:49:16,561 --> 01:49:18,828
We will move after Turgut Alp's wedding.

799
01:50:35,661 --> 01:50:39,328
I told you that Ertugrul
would cause trouble.

800
01:50:42,228 --> 01:50:43,961
We had a big opportunity.

801
01:50:46,328 --> 01:50:49,427
We should have killed him and his Alps
when we had the chance in the forest.

802
01:50:51,328 --> 01:50:52,861
We could have gotten rid of them all.

803
01:50:56,294 --> 01:50:57,561
But what have you done?

804
01:50:59,228 --> 01:51:04,261
You missed the opportunity
for the chest of Ibn Arabi.

805
01:51:10,528 --> 01:51:13,994
If Ertugrul had died
you would be alive now.

806
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:17,328
You would be in your office.

807
01:51:29,628 --> 01:51:30,894
It is too late now.

808
01:51:37,761 --> 01:51:40,694
That chest, we do not even know
what's inside of it

809
01:51:42,361 --> 01:51:44,394
has already defeated us.

810
01:51:47,561 --> 01:51:49,494
Only because of your stupidity.

811
01:51:56,694 --> 01:51:59,628
Go to hell, Petruchio Manzini.

812
01:53:08,028 --> 01:53:09,961
I met with Ibn Arabi, sir.

813
01:53:10,628 --> 01:53:13,394
He said that he would go to Damascus
in a couple of days.

814
01:53:15,361 --> 01:53:17,528
He wants me to go with him.

815
01:53:17,994 --> 01:53:20,494
-Will the chest be with him?
-Yes, sir.

816
01:53:21,661 --> 01:53:22,894
That is good.

817
01:53:23,694 --> 01:53:26,728
I will go to Constantinople
with the little Shahzade.

818
01:53:27,594 --> 01:53:28,994
I will meet you there.

819
01:53:54,394 --> 01:53:56,261
Halime Sultan buried the chest here.

820
01:53:56,861 --> 01:53:59,394
I did not touch it. I wanted you to know.

821
01:54:00,594 --> 01:54:04,728
Thank you, son.
I knew that it was in safe hands.

822
01:54:06,961 --> 01:54:09,861
That chest, I do not know
what is inside of it

823
01:54:11,461 --> 01:54:12,728
and I do not wonder about it.

824
01:54:13,361 --> 01:54:18,728
But both Black Priest Thomas
and The Templars are after it.

825
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:22,561
They quarrel among each other
because of it.

826
01:54:23,594 --> 01:54:27,361
Our chest saved you
and your Alps' life, son.

827
01:54:30,494 --> 01:54:33,528
Titus wanted to kill me
when they caught us

828
01:54:34,828 --> 01:54:36,728
but The Master did not let him do it.

829
01:54:38,361 --> 01:54:40,861
We are alive thanks to your chest.

830
01:54:44,294 --> 01:54:46,228
If you wonder what is inside of it

831
01:54:47,028 --> 01:54:49,728
I would say it is something
that has been entrusted to me.

832
01:54:51,228 --> 01:54:55,394
As I told you, leave it here
until I leave the tribe.

833
01:54:56,361 --> 01:54:57,561
As you wish.

834
01:55:03,461 --> 01:55:05,561
I heared that you will lay siege
to the castle.

835
01:55:07,494 --> 01:55:11,761
May God grant you victory.
May God give you strenght, son.

836
01:55:14,694 --> 01:55:15,694
Amen.

837
01:55:36,994 --> 01:55:38,461
I want to know something.

838
01:55:40,728 --> 01:55:44,561
Didn't you have a twinge of conscience
when you did all those evil things?

839
01:55:47,828 --> 01:55:49,661
I would not be able to if I did.

840
01:55:52,361 --> 01:55:55,028
My father kept coming to me.

841
01:55:56,894 --> 01:55:58,728
I wanted to avenge him.

842
01:56:01,694 --> 01:56:04,494
Now everyone will ostracize me
as if I have the plague, because of you.

843
01:56:05,961 --> 01:56:07,328
Gokce!

844
01:56:08,928 --> 01:56:10,994
You defiled our honor
just like our father did.

845
01:56:15,428 --> 01:56:16,561
You are right.

846
01:56:18,028 --> 01:56:24,461
But from now on my tongue will be mute
and my eyes will be blind.

847
01:56:26,794 --> 01:56:30,994
From now on, nobody will be harmed
because of me.

848
01:56:40,294 --> 01:56:42,228
I do not want to see you
for a while, sister.

849
01:56:44,828 --> 01:56:49,494
I don't want to ponder about
your evil deeds and hate you even more.

850
01:57:22,902 --> 01:57:24,635
Welcome mad boy.

851
01:57:26,502 --> 01:57:27,868
You are still like a bear.

852
01:57:27,935 --> 01:57:29,568
My brothers.

853
01:57:29,802 --> 01:57:31,735
I have missed fighting with you.

854
01:57:32,335 --> 01:57:34,602
I hope, we shall fight with the enemy
soon.

855
01:57:37,402 --> 01:57:39,568
If I do not take revenge from
The Templars...

856
01:57:39,735 --> 01:57:41,535
...I shall die in disappointment.

857
01:57:41,602 --> 01:57:44,702
You have a wedding tonight and you are
still wrestling us here.

858
01:57:45,302 --> 01:57:47,068
Pull yourself together.

859
01:57:47,402 --> 01:57:50,435
Otherwise Aykiz shall say,
"What have I done?

860
01:57:50,602 --> 01:57:53,368
Have I waited for this the whole time?"

861
01:58:02,668 --> 01:58:05,668
Brother, I do not have the dignity
to talk to my father or mother.

862
01:58:08,968 --> 01:58:11,102
They do not talk to me too.

863
01:58:12,602 --> 01:58:14,368
I do not know what to do.

864
01:58:18,968 --> 01:58:20,935
Do not leave Selcan Hatun alone, brother.

865
01:58:21,502 --> 01:58:24,902
No matter what she had done obviously
she is regretful.

866
01:58:25,402 --> 01:58:26,668
She seeks the right way.

867
01:58:27,935 --> 01:58:32,368
Ibn Arabi showed her the right way.
She needs your support too.

868
01:58:32,735 --> 01:58:34,535
Give her a little more time.

869
01:58:40,802 --> 01:58:42,535
Oh my brother.

870
01:59:14,468 --> 01:59:15,968
You are so lovely, Aykiz.

871
01:59:20,902 --> 01:59:22,502
I thank you girls.

872
01:59:22,668 --> 01:59:24,768
I wish all of your desires come true.

873
01:59:25,935 --> 01:59:27,368
You were patient.

874
01:59:27,502 --> 01:59:29,668
You have found happiness at the end,
Aykiz.

875
01:59:30,502 --> 01:59:33,502
You and Ertugrul Bey shall unite too,
Halime Sultan.

876
01:59:36,502 --> 01:59:37,602
If God permits.

877
01:59:40,668 --> 01:59:43,035
Is my cap ready, Gokce Hatun?
Let us put it on too.

878
01:59:43,368 --> 01:59:44,568
It is ready.

879
01:59:56,935 --> 01:59:58,102
Look.

880
01:59:59,302 --> 02:00:00,668
God bless.

881
02:00:57,902 --> 02:00:59,902
<i>I told you I would give you a son.</i>

882
02:01:02,468 --> 02:01:04,435
<i>I am carrying your child.</i>

883
02:01:05,535 --> 02:01:07,402
<i>I shall give birth to a warrior</i>
<i>for our people...</i>

884
02:01:07,668 --> 02:01:09,868
<i>...and a son of a Bey to Kayi tribe.</i>

885
02:01:11,668 --> 02:01:13,835
You tear my heart out, Selcan.

886
02:01:15,535 --> 02:01:17,302
You tear my heart out.

887
02:01:50,835 --> 02:01:54,035
This letter is for the
Principality of Antioch...

888
02:01:54,502 --> 02:01:55,802
...and this one is for Cyprus.

889
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:57,502
Yes, my Lord.

890
02:01:58,102 --> 02:01:59,868
Have a safe journey.

891
02:02:28,502 --> 02:02:30,402
The chest of Ibn Arabi...

892
02:02:31,335 --> 02:02:33,002
...I do not even care about it.

893
02:02:33,635 --> 02:02:37,002
The Cardinal told me the latest
notices about the chest.

894
02:02:38,402 --> 02:02:39,802
We are not rivals anymore.

895
02:02:42,335 --> 02:02:45,402
You being a disciple of Arabi...

896
02:02:45,668 --> 02:02:48,935
... shall open many doors for our battle
with Islamic world.

897
02:02:49,935 --> 02:02:51,102
Congratulations.

898
02:03:24,402 --> 02:03:28,402
It must be here according to the map
Isadora drew.

899
02:03:28,535 --> 02:03:29,735
She says above the water.

900
02:03:33,502 --> 02:03:35,668
She drew what she heard from her father.

901
02:03:36,102 --> 02:03:38,635
If it is correct, this place is somewhere
under the bridge.

902
02:03:39,835 --> 02:03:41,835
Do you mean that this may not be
the place?

903
02:03:44,002 --> 02:03:48,835
All of Ertugrul Bey's plans can fall
through then.

904
02:04:57,035 --> 02:05:01,568
In such a place full of heathens
there must be something deceitful.

905
02:05:02,468 --> 02:05:03,635
You are right.

906
02:08:03,468 --> 02:08:04,635
Here it is.

907
02:09:24,835 --> 02:09:26,668
Dogan I have something to utter, brother.

908
02:09:27,435 --> 02:09:28,468
Say it, brother.

909
02:09:29,402 --> 02:09:31,802
Are not we three Alps?

910
02:09:32,502 --> 02:09:33,668
Yes, brother.

911
02:09:35,068 --> 02:09:37,002
We all have certain skills.

912
02:09:38,368 --> 02:09:39,368
Yes.

913
02:09:39,435 --> 02:09:42,535
Turgut brother is like a lion.

914
02:09:43,035 --> 02:09:44,302
Much thanks.

915
02:09:44,435 --> 02:09:47,802
I am a master swordsman.

916
02:09:48,702 --> 02:09:54,435
Take no offence but what is your skill?

917
02:10:00,068 --> 02:10:03,435
God give me patience. Look at Bamsi.

918
02:10:03,535 --> 02:10:05,302
He became a cat and trying to eat us.

919
02:10:05,368 --> 02:10:07,835
Stop it, do not grumble again.

920
02:10:08,435 --> 02:10:10,902
I swear, I shall go back
to the dungeon of The Templar's.

921
02:10:11,035 --> 02:10:13,935
Stop, brother. We found you so hard.

922
02:10:14,635 --> 02:10:16,102
Do not listen to him.

923
02:10:16,668 --> 02:10:19,402
He cannot face the truth
that he is unskilled.

924
02:10:25,035 --> 02:10:26,868
Here you are, brother. Your hat is here.

925
02:10:26,968 --> 02:10:27,968
Much thanks.

926
02:10:28,635 --> 02:10:34,968
Aykiz should pray day and night
that she marries a warrior like you.

927
02:10:35,968 --> 02:10:37,968
You have become very handsome, brother.

928
02:10:38,568 --> 02:10:39,868
Much thanks.

929
02:10:40,502 --> 02:10:41,802
My brothers.

930
02:11:33,835 --> 02:11:35,935
Is it dangerous to open the tunnels then?

931
02:11:37,002 --> 02:11:42,935
We can open them but I am worried
about the traps inside, Gundogdu Bey.

932
02:11:44,668 --> 02:11:47,435
If we do not strengthen
the sections we dig...

933
02:11:47,702 --> 02:11:50,702
...whole tunnel may collapse upon us.

934
02:11:51,702 --> 02:11:53,635
This can take months, my Bey.

935
02:11:55,401 --> 02:11:58,668
Can we endure a siege lasting for months,
Ertugrul?

936
02:11:59,735 --> 02:12:02,602
If any help does not come from outside,
we can my Bey.

937
02:12:03,768 --> 02:12:05,102
Are the Alps ready?

938
02:12:05,835 --> 02:12:07,335
Yes they are, brother.

939
02:12:08,702 --> 02:12:09,901
With God's help.

940
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:14,502
We shall march after Turgut Alp's wedding
then.

941
02:12:17,435 --> 02:12:20,868
You go and say goodbye to Aykiz,
Wild Demir.

942
02:12:21,768 --> 02:12:23,935
Try not to cry too much.

943
02:12:25,068 --> 02:12:28,868
We did not have peace in our tribe
for a long time, my Bey.

944
02:12:29,602 --> 02:12:32,468
Thank God, there is now, thanks to you.

945
02:13:16,702 --> 02:13:21,502
I wish your mother was alive
to see these days.

946
02:13:27,702 --> 02:13:29,568
My dear father.

947
02:13:32,102 --> 02:13:34,502
I would give my life for you.

948
02:13:35,535 --> 02:13:37,002
May you live long.

949
02:13:40,102 --> 02:13:42,068
You raised me without a mother.

950
02:13:44,568 --> 02:13:46,702
Give me your blessing.

951
02:13:53,602 --> 02:13:55,302
I give you my blessing.

952
02:14:02,035 --> 02:14:03,468
Listen to me, my daughter.

953
02:14:05,402 --> 02:14:11,002
I have never fed you ill-gotten food.

954
02:14:12,835 --> 02:14:15,435
You do not feed your children too.

955
02:14:16,902 --> 02:14:18,602
Be faithful to your husband.

956
02:14:19,635 --> 02:14:21,802
Do not utter ill words to him.

957
02:14:22,702 --> 02:14:28,502
Do not make him repeat his words,
always be by his side.

958
02:14:33,302 --> 02:14:34,935
Permission?

959
02:14:36,302 --> 02:14:40,802
Yes, my son. Come in.

960
02:15:02,402 --> 02:15:03,735
Listen to me, son.

961
02:15:04,035 --> 02:15:07,568
I have always deemed you as my son.

962
02:15:09,102 --> 02:15:11,068
Do not sadden my daughter.

963
02:15:13,968 --> 02:15:18,102
Do not show her your manliness
by brute force.

964
02:15:19,735 --> 02:15:25,402
She is entrusted to you first
by the Creator then by me.

965
02:15:26,968 --> 02:15:29,002
Do not hurt what is entrusted.

966
02:15:32,635 --> 02:15:39,635
I shall not hurt what you entrusted me
as long as I breathe, father.

967
02:15:46,902 --> 02:15:48,402
It is an Alp's vow.

968
02:16:00,068 --> 02:16:06,335
The day is ours, come on then.

969
02:16:38,368 --> 02:16:40,302
Everyone shall open their hands...

970
02:16:40,568 --> 02:16:42,068
...and not tie them...

971
02:16:44,368 --> 02:16:46,502
...and utter as I do.

972
02:16:47,768 --> 02:16:49,402
For all our sins...

973
02:16:50,035 --> 02:16:51,768
<i>...we swear not to repeat them.</i>

974
02:16:51,835 --> 02:16:53,602
<i>We swear not to repeat them.</i>

975
02:16:53,668 --> 02:16:55,768
<i>-We swear.</i>
<i>-We swear.</i>

976
02:16:55,835 --> 02:16:58,402
<i>-We swear.</i>
<i>-We swear.</i>

977
02:16:59,368 --> 02:17:02,402
<i>For He is the Greatest.</i>

978
02:17:02,902 --> 02:17:04,602
<i>For there is...</i>

979
02:17:05,068 --> 02:17:06,868
<i>...no deity but Him.</i>

980
02:17:07,835 --> 02:17:11,468
<i>He is the owner of everything.</i>

981
02:17:11,535 --> 02:17:12,835
We ask His forgiveness.

982
02:17:13,468 --> 02:17:16,368
<i>We believe in God and in His angels...</i>

983
02:17:16,602 --> 02:17:19,668
<i>...and in His books and in His Prophets...</i>

984
02:17:19,935 --> 02:17:25,602
<i>...and in the day of reckoning</i>
<i>and in destiny.</i>

985
02:17:25,968 --> 02:17:28,402
<i>We believe that goodness and malice</i>
<i>are all His creations.</i>

986
02:17:29,068 --> 02:17:32,902
<i>There is no deity but God and Muhammad</i>
<i>is his Prophet and subject.</i>

987
02:17:33,435 --> 02:17:34,668
Amen.

988
02:17:41,768 --> 02:17:44,502
You, Aykiz, daughter of Dukak's son Demir.

989
02:17:45,302 --> 02:17:47,968
Do you accept your marriage with Turgut,
son of Konur Alp...

990
02:17:48,035 --> 02:17:55,035
...with 10 dirhams of gold and
20 sheep...

991
02:17:55,702 --> 02:17:57,568
...as alimony?

992
02:18:01,802 --> 02:18:02,835
I do.

993
02:18:03,435 --> 02:18:04,435
Do you?

994
02:18:04,702 --> 02:18:05,868
I do.

995
02:18:06,002 --> 02:18:07,002
Do you?

996
02:18:07,702 --> 02:18:08,935
I do.

997
02:18:09,935 --> 02:18:11,702
You, Turgut, son of Konur Alp.

998
02:18:12,835 --> 02:18:17,535
Do you accept your marriage with Aykiz,
daughter of Demir...

999
02:18:18,102 --> 02:18:20,102
...with the alimony you pledged?

1000
02:18:20,402 --> 02:18:21,535
I do.

1001
02:18:21,835 --> 02:18:23,302
Do you?

1002
02:18:23,368 --> 02:18:24,402
I do.

1003
02:18:24,468 --> 02:18:25,502
Do you?

1004
02:18:25,735 --> 02:18:27,302
I do.

1005
02:18:30,502 --> 02:18:33,635
Witnesses, do you witness this marriage?

1006
02:18:33,868 --> 02:18:35,068
We do.

1007
02:18:41,635 --> 02:18:44,035
May God bless your marriage.

1008
02:18:44,435 --> 02:18:45,768
Amen.

1009
02:18:48,935 --> 02:18:55,502
My God, we do witness this marriage
of these two children of ours.

1010
02:18:55,635 --> 02:19:00,802
You be a witness too.
My God, bless this marriage.

1011
02:19:01,468 --> 02:19:07,568
Let this couple be nice to each other,
and have persistence in their marriage.

1012
02:19:07,635 --> 02:19:08,668
Amen.

1013
02:19:08,735 --> 02:19:14,035
Do not give them hatred, dissension
and separation.

1014
02:19:14,102 --> 02:19:15,502
Amen.

1015
02:19:15,868 --> 02:19:21,735
My God, give this couple
the peace and fondness...

1016
02:19:22,535 --> 02:19:28,068
...that existed between Adam and Eve,
Muhammad...

1017
02:19:29,368 --> 02:19:33,902
...peace be upon him and
Khadija and Ali...

1018
02:19:34,568 --> 02:19:41,535
...may God be pleased from him and Fatima.

1019
02:19:42,335 --> 02:19:43,568
-Amen.
-My God...

1020
02:19:43,668 --> 02:19:49,102
...give this couple benign children,
long lifetime and plenty of sustenance.

1021
02:19:49,535 --> 02:19:52,668
-Amen.
-My God...

1022
02:19:53,868 --> 02:19:57,935
...make our wives and children
as lights for our eyes.

1023
02:19:58,568 --> 02:20:02,468
Make us pioneers for those
who are afraid to revolt God.

1024
02:20:02,568 --> 02:20:03,902
Amen.

1025
02:20:04,035 --> 02:20:09,435
My God, give us goodness, kindness
and blessings in this world too.

1026
02:20:09,602 --> 02:20:10,635
Amen.

1027
02:20:10,702 --> 02:20:13,802
Give us goodness, kindness
and blessings in the afterlife too.

1028
02:20:13,868 --> 02:20:16,468
-Spare us from the torment of fire.
-Amen.

1029
02:20:18,035 --> 02:20:23,302
Your God is the one with might and honor
and is distant from their accusations...

1030
02:20:23,735 --> 02:20:26,535
...and is supreme.

1031
02:20:27,335 --> 02:20:30,735
Greetings to the prophets.

1032
02:20:31,102 --> 02:20:32,468
-Amen.
-Glory belongs...

1033
02:20:32,602 --> 02:20:35,568
...only to God the deity of worlds.

1034
02:20:37,402 --> 02:20:41,835
<i>My God who is supreme</i>
<i>and who is distant from accusations.</i>

1035
02:20:42,102 --> 02:20:43,968
<i>Greetings to all prophets.</i>

1036
02:20:44,302 --> 02:20:46,702
<i>Glory belongs only to Him.</i>

1037
02:20:47,635 --> 02:20:48,935
<i>Al Fatihah.</i>

1038
02:20:57,835 --> 02:20:59,335
Amen.

1039
02:21:40,368 --> 02:21:45,402
May God grant you a long and happy life
with your children.

1040
02:21:46,435 --> 02:21:50,968
May God grant you eternal happiness
and bless your family.

1041
02:22:10,802 --> 02:22:13,868
May God make you happy and give
you a long lasting marriage.

1042
02:22:14,402 --> 02:22:16,402
Much Thanks, my Bey.

1043
02:22:18,902 --> 02:22:20,502
I hope the same for you.

1044
02:22:25,768 --> 02:22:27,035
Thank you Bey.

1045
02:22:29,835 --> 02:22:31,035
Be happy.

1046
02:22:31,502 --> 02:22:33,435
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

1047
02:22:34,035 --> 02:22:37,868
May God consummate your engagement
with Halime Sultan.

1048
02:22:38,835 --> 02:22:40,002
Amen.

1049
02:23:29,835 --> 02:23:33,335
What has Turgut Alp done?

1050
02:23:33,502 --> 02:23:38,635
He put up a tent in the sky.

1051
02:23:41,035 --> 02:23:45,035
What has he done to make
the woman he loved happy?

1052
02:23:45,535 --> 02:23:50,402
He made a stallion from a horse
raised a camel and a ram.

1053
02:23:51,335 --> 02:23:53,668
Have they broken any hearts?

1054
02:23:54,302 --> 02:23:57,402
Have they utter ill words?

1055
02:23:57,735 --> 02:24:00,902
Neither they broke hearts
nor they uttered ill words.

1056
02:24:01,302 --> 02:24:06,835
They wed each other
and reached happiness.

1057
02:24:07,402 --> 02:24:11,768
May God make them happy then.

1058
02:24:11,835 --> 02:24:13,402
Amen.

1059
02:24:13,468 --> 02:24:15,068
Be in ever happiness.

1060
02:24:15,402 --> 02:24:17,802
May God grant you a long marriage.

1061
02:24:18,702 --> 02:24:21,602
What has Turgut Alp done?

1062
02:24:22,302 --> 02:24:25,835
He put up a tent in the sky.

1063
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:30,068
What has he done to make
the woman he loved, happy?

1064
02:24:30,468 --> 02:24:35,368
He made a stallion from a horse
raised a camel and a ram.

1065
02:24:58,002 --> 02:25:01,468
Come on!

1066
02:25:13,935 --> 02:25:19,302
I prayed much to kill you
if you had lost your path...

1067
02:25:21,068 --> 02:25:23,702
...and became the tribe's enemy.

1068
02:25:26,702 --> 02:25:30,502
I also prayed much to die in your hands,
Aykiz.

1069
02:25:34,802 --> 02:25:36,535
They are all in the past now.

1070
02:25:38,035 --> 02:25:44,002
May God not let me live a single day
without your love.

1071
02:25:46,002 --> 02:25:48,468
This is what I know and say.

1072
02:25:50,902 --> 02:25:53,502
May God never separate us
my brave man.

1073
02:26:19,035 --> 02:26:23,635
When we take Yigit Alp back,
we should make a big wedding too.

1074
02:26:24,935 --> 02:26:26,702
If God permits, Ertugrul Bey.

1075
02:26:35,635 --> 02:26:37,835
I shall gather all people tomorrow.

1076
02:26:38,768 --> 02:26:40,968
Just like the old days.

1077
02:26:42,668 --> 02:26:43,835
I hope it is well, Bey.

1078
02:26:44,435 --> 02:26:47,335
I missed fighting, Hayme, fighting.

1079
02:26:48,002 --> 02:26:49,968
It is time for resurrection now.

1080
02:26:50,735 --> 02:26:54,602
We shall resurrect so that Turkish nation
shall wake up.

1081
02:27:00,702 --> 02:27:03,035
Turn your back, I shall apply
your ointment.

1082
02:27:03,335 --> 02:27:05,835
Even the boil does not hurt me anymore,
Hayme.

1083
02:27:06,568 --> 02:27:08,868
You shall overcome it too, my Bey.

1084
02:27:56,768 --> 02:28:03,502
Long live Suleyman Shah!

1085
02:28:03,802 --> 02:28:07,568
Long live Suleyman Shah!

1086
02:28:13,535 --> 02:28:14,868
My Alps...

1087
02:28:17,368 --> 02:28:18,735
...my Beys.

1088
02:28:20,568 --> 02:28:22,535
My sword brothers.

1089
02:28:23,402 --> 02:28:28,768
My ghazis who are impatient to
become martyrs.

1090
02:28:30,868 --> 02:28:34,102
I summoned you in order to take
the life of the enemy...

1091
02:28:34,902 --> 02:28:40,068
...who wants to take away
our unity and peace...

1092
02:28:40,968 --> 02:28:45,102
...by using all kinds of
instigation and trickery.

1093
02:28:46,302 --> 02:28:51,902
We shall bring that big walled castle down
in which they hide from our anger.

1094
02:28:54,568 --> 02:28:58,535
We shall rumble the earth and sky
with the sound of our Alps...

1095
02:28:59,035 --> 02:29:00,768
...who shall enter blue and exit red.

1096
02:29:00,835 --> 02:29:07,802
God is Great!

1097
02:29:07,935 --> 02:29:12,635
God is Great!

1098
02:29:13,935 --> 02:29:17,568
For such a long time,
they have tortured our tribe.

1099
02:29:18,068 --> 02:29:20,735
They tried to kill our brave sons.

1100
02:29:21,402 --> 02:29:23,935
Now, it is time to pay the price.

1101
02:29:24,468 --> 02:29:29,035
You know the best how dirty, rotten
and rancid the Templars are...

1102
02:29:29,868 --> 02:29:34,968
...who spread fear...

1103
02:29:35,568 --> 02:29:37,568
...all over the World.

1104
02:29:39,335 --> 02:29:44,068
We shall bring that castle down
with our noble blood...

1105
02:29:44,635 --> 02:29:46,502
...and faith you possess.

1106
02:29:46,702 --> 02:29:52,368
God is Great!

1107
02:29:52,568 --> 02:29:55,102
God is Great!

1108
02:29:56,768 --> 02:29:58,568
Do you pledge to fight by my side?

1109
02:29:58,635 --> 02:30:00,068
We do!

1110
02:30:01,502 --> 02:30:04,335
Do you pledge to become martyrs
by my side?

1111
02:30:04,402 --> 02:30:05,735
We do!

1112
02:30:05,968 --> 02:30:07,068
God is Great!

1113
02:30:07,302 --> 02:30:13,035
God is Great!

1114
02:30:13,102 --> 02:30:19,668
God is Great!

1115
02:30:19,735 --> 02:30:26,568
God is Great!

1116
02:30:26,768 --> 02:30:30,335
God is Great!

1117
02:30:30,402 --> 02:30:34,402
May God bless you and be in our aid.

1118
02:30:34,602 --> 02:30:36,302
Amen!
