Episode 23 will start after 12:22 min

12:22.551 --> 12:25.551
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:27.389 --> 12:30.389
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:31.602 --> 12:34.602
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:44.004 --> 12:48.970
Show Kurdoglu to everybody
in front of my marquee until he is tried.

12:50.737 --> 12:55.904
It will be an example for the ones who may
attempt to put us in this shame again.

12:58.770 --> 13:01.737
We did not act together
with this bastard, Bey.

13:01.804 --> 13:04.737
But we could not stand straight
and go against him...

13:04.870 --> 13:08.904
...like our Alps and beys
who were martyred, either. Forgive us.

13:09.004 --> 13:12.370
We would like to kiss your hand
if you permit.

13:12.437 --> 13:14.537
Forgive us.

15:47.637 --> 15:51.737
That bastard who has not
had his share from being fair...

15:51.837 --> 15:57.970
...did every kinds of persecutions
to my family and my brave brothers.

15:59.737 --> 16:02.937
However, I will never avoid
being fair.

16:04.337 --> 16:07.370
He will be punished in the
headquarters meeting.

16:09.204 --> 16:13.537
The punishment
will be executed as decided.

16:14.637 --> 16:18.204
Nobody should doubt it.

16:18.504 --> 16:21.804
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

16:27.670 --> 16:31.904
Even though
we are surrounded by enemies...

16:32.004 --> 16:34.870
...and the Crusaders give us trouble...

16:35.737 --> 16:38.470
...we did not lose our unity.

16:40.537 --> 16:45.304
The fire of instigation among us
has been put out as of today.

16:46.537 --> 16:50.504
No matter how strong our enemy is...

16:50.604 --> 16:55.204
...we will protect both our tent
and our religion, by God's will.

17:02.937 --> 17:05.470
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

17:07.970 --> 17:10.837
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

18:08.270 --> 18:10.837
This drug will decrease your pain.

18:10.937 --> 18:12.570
I am very sorry, sir.

18:16.870 --> 18:21.470
I remember the infidels
I have poisoned all this time.

18:22.804 --> 18:28.370
The ones from Ayyubids, Seljuks...

18:32.637 --> 18:36.537
The Council of the Templars
will arrive soon, doctor.

18:37.504 --> 18:43.870
This must be kept as a secret
between us until they leave.

18:44.737 --> 18:45.837
Do you understand me?

18:45.904 --> 18:47.270
Yes, sir.

18:47.337 --> 18:48.870
May God protect you, sir.

18:48.937 --> 18:52.470
God has left me, doctor.

18:53.804 --> 18:59.937
And Kurdoglu whom I worked
so hard on with high hopes, lost the game.

19:00.204 --> 19:02.904
Kayis are a bigger enemy now.

19:04.704 --> 19:07.404
What I am curious about is that...

19:07.504 --> 19:13.337
...where my niece Isadora
found this poisoned dagger from.

19:23.270 --> 19:27.304
The great grandmasters
of the Council are here! Open the gates!

19:31.370 --> 19:33.570
Excuse me, Grandmaster Petruchio.

20:08.937 --> 20:11.370
Welcome, Grandmasters.

20:11.537 --> 20:13.270
You honored our castle.

20:13.637 --> 20:16.270
Thank you, Titus.

20:17.404 --> 20:19.604
Where is Grandmaster Petruchio?

20:20.904 --> 20:25.204
What is so important
that he could not come here to welcome us?

20:27.804 --> 20:30.504
He will welcome you in his room, sir.

20:58.470 --> 21:02.537
He is curious about how Isadora
found the poison on her knife.

21:04.304 --> 21:08.637
I will tell him that I was the one
who gave Isadore the poisoned knife...

21:08.737 --> 21:13.204
...when his tongue swells and he will not
be able to talk in a few days.

21:13.270 --> 21:15.337
You can go now, doctor.

21:27.504 --> 21:32.304
Grandmaster Petruchio
will die in a few days.

21:32.770 --> 21:35.870
The Council members
will elect a new grandmaster.

21:36.904 --> 21:40.204
Who will the new grandmaster be, Cardinal?

21:40.304 --> 21:42.237
Titus, of course.

21:43.904 --> 21:47.670
Tell Titus to secretly
come and visit me tonight.

21:52.004 --> 21:55.970
When will you bring Ibn al-Arabi's relic?

21:57.404 --> 21:59.570
I will visit him tomorrow.

21:59.637 --> 22:02.270
Good. Bring it as soon as possible.

22:02.370 --> 22:03.937
I want to take the Shahzade...

22:04.004 --> 22:07.604
...and get away from this
ominous place as soon as possible.

22:07.704 --> 22:09.537
Do not worry, sir.

22:24.937 --> 22:26.770
My brave man.

22:26.870 --> 22:28.637
My strong man.

22:28.704 --> 22:34.437
Weapons, heroism and being a bey
befits you so much.

22:39.537 --> 22:41.537
My moon-faced woman.

22:42.370 --> 22:47.904
My life companion
who laughs and saddens with me.

22:49.204 --> 22:52.837
Being a bey is a cloth made of fire.

22:53.937 --> 22:57.204
Putting it on and off
are both tough ordeals.

22:57.470 --> 22:58.837
You are right.

22:58.904 --> 23:01.837
This marquee suffered so much.

23:02.504 --> 23:04.604
There have been so many troubles.

23:04.670 --> 23:11.370
Hayme, I thought about not coming back
to this marquee for a moment.

23:12.470 --> 23:16.904
However, if he did not,
we would be obeying persecution.

23:18.670 --> 23:23.737
If we did not struggle for the underdogs,
the pharaohs would have won.

23:24.570 --> 23:28.504
Even one single breath
is too much for a persecutor.

23:29.504 --> 23:31.337
You are right, Bey.

23:31.970 --> 23:34.237
What will you do to Kurdoglu?

23:35.470 --> 23:38.237
How he will end up is certain.

23:39.870 --> 23:44.437
I only want to bring down the castle
on the Templars now.

23:44.970 --> 23:48.470
Either that castle
will be destroyed, or us.

23:55.304 --> 23:57.537
Dundar?

23:58.637 --> 24:00.470
Son?

24:01.270 --> 24:03.370
Mother. Father.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.670
Your mother would give her life
for you, my son!

24:08.737 --> 24:12.837
Thank God for this double joy.

24:24.204 --> 24:27.470
I was so scared that
we would not get together again.

24:27.570 --> 24:30.570
What would I do
if anything happened to you?

24:42.337 --> 24:46.270
What protects a person from death
is their determined time of death.

24:49.704 --> 24:52.670
See, we could come together again.

24:53.903 --> 24:55.970
Thank God.

24:58.403 --> 24:59.903
What is going to happen now?

25:04.604 --> 25:07.903
First, Kurdoglu will be punished
like the way he deserves.

25:07.970 --> 25:13.737
And then, those Templars' castle
will be brought down on them.

25:25.470 --> 25:26.970
Gazelle eyes.

25:29.937 --> 25:34.604
May sadness, grief and sorrow
be away from us.

25:41.004 --> 25:42.504
My brave man.

25:43.737 --> 25:47.204
Neither sadness,
nor grief or sorrow for us...

25:51.704 --> 25:53.604
It is time for the meeting.

25:54.604 --> 25:58.637
What happened to "The hunt is ours,
and the meeting is theirs"?

25:59.870 --> 26:02.870
I am the one who is given duty now.

26:02.937 --> 26:05.537
They are both ours.

26:39.670 --> 26:42.537
Life without you was a dungeon for me.

26:46.570 --> 26:52.337
Your love gave me life
in those dungeons, Aykiz.

26:56.770 --> 26:59.504
Let us come together now, Turgut.

27:00.604 --> 27:03.937
I do not have strength
to bear even one more day.

27:04.870 --> 27:08.704
Let us talk to your father and our Bey...

27:08.770 --> 27:12.470
...and get married as soon as possible.

27:31.437 --> 27:32.904
Turgut...

27:33.270 --> 27:34.704
Turgut...

27:34.837 --> 27:36.570
Turgut...

27:36.637 --> 27:39.004
We will get rid of this plague.

27:39.270 --> 27:40.904
We will get rid of it.

27:47.404 --> 27:48.704
If...

27:50.270 --> 27:53.570
If I attempt to hurt you unknowingly...

28:00.504 --> 28:02.237
Take this dagger.

28:03.204 --> 28:04.737
Kill me.

29:05.570 --> 29:08.804
You are scared that I would talk,
are you not?

29:08.870 --> 29:10.937
That I would turn you in.

29:11.004 --> 29:15.870
Would I not have thanked them
for killing me, if I did that?

29:16.270 --> 29:21.837
I want to leave the biggest plague
as legacy to Suleyman and his children.

29:22.770 --> 29:27.270
And my biggest fortune,
my biggest legacy is you.

30:38.237 --> 30:41.237
By the name of the 99 names of God...

30:41.304 --> 30:46.204
...who creates everything with only one
word and fills our hearts with faith.

30:50.370 --> 30:55.204
Beys, I suffered a lot
during this last period of my life.

30:56.870 --> 31:00.404
I lost my children and my first wife.

31:01.504 --> 31:04.204
So many of my brothers
died in my arms.

31:05.270 --> 31:10.637
However, none of these hurt me
as much as this last betrayal did.

31:14.470 --> 31:18.437
That traitor overthrew me with tricks.

31:19.470 --> 31:24.770
He defamed my woman,
my children and my sister-in-law.

31:25.737 --> 31:27.337
He tortured them.

31:28.437 --> 31:31.804
But the beys of the headquarters
did not say anything!

31:32.570 --> 31:35.870
They did not stand straight
against the persecutor!

31:39.437 --> 31:41.237
Why is that?

31:41.337 --> 31:42.970
Why is that?

31:44.470 --> 31:45.804
Forgive us, Bey.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.770
Kurdoglu deceived us.

31:49.837 --> 31:55.404
Then, I will not arrange headquarters
meetings with beys who were deceived.

31:58.737 --> 32:00.737
All of you are dismissed!

32:03.004 --> 32:05.670
We will have new beys here.

32:27.637 --> 32:29.704
Ertugrul...

32:30.470 --> 32:32.637
Kurdoglu's duties are yours.

32:33.937 --> 32:36.604
Gundogdu...

32:36.670 --> 32:39.204
Provision of food is your duty.

32:41.370 --> 32:44.337
Now, bring Kurdoglu here!

33:07.710 --> 33:10.277
You have long since
deserved to die, Kurtoglu.

33:10.343 --> 33:12.277
No one will ever trust you now.

33:12.343 --> 33:14.277
You are going to die.

33:19.177 --> 33:22.143
Your punishment was determined, Kurtoglu.

33:33.110 --> 33:34.277
Thank God.

33:36.043 --> 33:37.977
Peace is upon our people now!

33:39.277 --> 33:40.677
We got rid of this trouble, too.

33:41.377 --> 33:44.677
Now, it is time to arrange your weddings.

33:49.577 --> 33:51.177
With permission of our father...

33:52.043 --> 33:54.177
...we do not want to have
a wedding ceremony, mother.

33:58.877 --> 34:01.010
The war against the Templars
is inevitable now.

34:01.677 --> 34:03.077
We are all aware of it.

34:04.877 --> 34:06.877
If God permits,
we want to have our ceremonies...

34:07.377 --> 34:08.810
...after the war.

34:09.910 --> 34:11.043
When our men...

34:11.877 --> 34:13.210
...and my brother, Yigit...

34:14.010 --> 34:16.577
...return home safely.

34:24.043 --> 34:25.843
Just like Halime Sultan says,

34:26.943 --> 34:31.310
Suleyman Shah, Ertugrul Bey, Gundogdu Bey

34:32.043 --> 34:34.810
will never come back
before they demolish their castles.

34:40.143 --> 34:41.910
If they can not return home safely,

34:44.010 --> 34:48.777
we will, at least, have the honor
to lead a life as their widows.

34:52.910 --> 34:54.277
With our father's consent,

34:55.343 --> 34:58.910
we would like to exchange vows
before the war breaks out.

35:03.577 --> 35:09.610
Oh, my beautiful girls!
You are as brave as your men!

35:10.943 --> 35:12.743
May God bless you!

35:17.610 --> 35:19.910
We went all through this
because of that dog, named Kurtoglu.

35:22.643 --> 35:25.777
We have seen his men die
one after another.

35:26.310 --> 35:27.777
Now, it is his time to pay.

35:28.743 --> 35:30.210
Just after he is punished,

35:31.177 --> 35:34.943
I will convey your requests
to our Suleyman Shah.

35:36.677 --> 35:37.677
Agreed?

35:38.243 --> 35:39.377
We appreciate, mother.

35:40.210 --> 35:42.710
Some of his men may still be alive.

35:43.777 --> 35:48.577
Who knows?
There may be others who share his sins.

35:50.010 --> 35:52.210
He will have to confess
in the headquarters.

35:54.143 --> 35:55.343
May God protect us!

36:11.210 --> 36:14.943
-Traitor!
-Hang him!

37:37.343 --> 37:38.577
Kurtoglu!

37:39.643 --> 37:42.110
Do you have something to say?

37:49.177 --> 37:52.977
I spent my life rushing from one battle
to another for our nomad group.

37:55.643 --> 37:57.077
I lost everything I had,

37:57.710 --> 38:00.210
my sons, my wife,

38:00.877 --> 38:02.810
while fighting for our people.

38:05.710 --> 38:11.610
I did everything to enlarge our boundaries
and strengthen our nomad group.

38:12.177 --> 38:14.977
To have our own lands
and found a seigniory.

38:17.810 --> 38:20.877
I want these to be taken
into consideration, Bey.

38:21.910 --> 38:26.210
You have ruined your bravery
with treachery, Kurtoglu.

38:27.777 --> 38:29.743
There are no excuses for treachery

38:30.877 --> 38:33.243
and it must be punished by death.

38:36.843 --> 38:40.710
It appears that you have learned
to confess sins from Templars, Kurtoglu.

38:42.577 --> 38:45.043
Yet, this is no place
to confess your sins.

38:49.143 --> 38:54.310
I demand a punishment
that will not ruin my dignity, Bey!

38:56.143 --> 39:00.943
How can you still
speak of dignity, traitor?

39:02.910 --> 39:06.010
Beys! I demand mercy!

39:08.243 --> 39:11.177
Show mercy! Please!

39:13.310 --> 39:16.777
You'll be shown mercy
just as much as you did, Kurtoglu.

39:20.377 --> 39:23.710
You will be shown
as much mercy as you showed

39:23.777 --> 39:26.743
to Alps you have slaughtered
with Karatoygar and Titus.

39:29.843 --> 39:30.843
Kurtoglu!

39:31.943 --> 39:37.010
You are guilty of betraying
your people, Bey.

39:37.077 --> 39:39.910
You have violated religion and traditions.

39:40.877 --> 39:43.310
You are sentenced to death.

39:54.710 --> 39:56.177
Take this traitor out.

40:01.377 --> 40:07.243
Bey! I demand mercy!

40:10.077 --> 40:11.810
Bey! For the sake of our past!

40:14.110 --> 40:17.077
Send me to dark dungeons but...

40:17.943 --> 40:19.977
...spare my life.

40:23.310 --> 40:25.143
Spare my life, Bey!

40:25.210 --> 40:26.377
Spare my life!

40:27.277 --> 40:31.710
Bey! Spare my life.

40:32.677 --> 40:33.710
Spare my life!

40:34.843 --> 40:35.877
Spare my life!

40:39.243 --> 40:40.377
Spare my life, Bey!

40:43.110 --> 40:44.343
Spare my life!

40:55.377 --> 40:57.177
-Kill him!

40:58.143 --> 41:00.810
-Murderer!
-He murdered our sons!

41:03.777 --> 41:05.210
-Traitor!

42:30.777 --> 42:37.710
We promised to die for each other
while becoming blood brothers.

42:39.677 --> 42:42.043
We promised not to use our swords
against one another.

42:44.377 --> 42:46.343
I am going to keep my promise.

42:47.977 --> 42:50.243
Because I keep my words.

42:51.777 --> 42:53.277
I am not going to take your life.

44:34.577 --> 44:36.743
I bear witness that
there is no god but Allah

44:36.943 --> 44:40.310
and Muhammad is the servant
and Messenger of Allah.

44:43.377 --> 44:45.143
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

45:16.877 --> 45:18.877
God!

45:20.077 --> 45:24.643
-Allahu akbar!
-Divine Justice...

46:25.710 --> 46:26.710
From now on,

46:26.777 --> 46:31.143
none can stand against our next

46:31.210 --> 46:34.743
and the biggest crusade.

46:36.810 --> 46:39.043
Cardinal Thomas finished the report

46:39.110 --> 46:44.777
that he has been preparing for Pope
and the Frederick, the Emperor.

46:46.077 --> 46:48.343
His report is beyond our expectations.

46:50.243 --> 46:54.577
He mentions our efforts with praise.

46:56.243 --> 47:02.343
I propose a toast to you,
to the precious knights of our cult.

47:03.810 --> 47:05.677
Welcome back!

47:39.810 --> 47:41.610
What about Kayi tribe?

47:42.010 --> 47:45.577
Do you think that we have not heard of
what the Turk, named Ertugrul did

47:45.643 --> 47:52.643
and you cannot fight him back properly,
Master Petruchio?

47:54.077 --> 47:59.077
We have heard of how he uncovered
our intelligence network in Aleppo

47:59.143 --> 48:04.977
and how he slaughtered tons of our spies
and brave knights like animals.

48:05.110 --> 48:11.843
Master Ricardo!
Please you all tell me this.

48:12.243 --> 48:18.010
Did his apostles give up fighting
after Jesus was crucified?

48:19.743 --> 48:25.910
I am sure you are all aware that
you have to face unforeseen obstacles

48:25.977 --> 48:29.310
while marching to your destination.

48:31.743 --> 48:35.943
How can we trust you, Master Petruchio?

48:38.277 --> 48:43.277
How can we believe in your word...

48:43.343 --> 48:47.310
...after all these defeats.

49:17.777 --> 49:20.010
As Salam Alaykum
wa Rahmatullah.

49:20.377 --> 49:21.977
As Salam Alaykum
wa Rahmatullah.

49:27.377 --> 49:29.677
God, give me strength!

49:30.277 --> 49:34.710
Take my life but do not let them
hold me captive like my brother, Turgut.

49:46.310 --> 49:48.610
Cardinal Thomas summons you.

49:50.177 --> 49:53.243
Go tell that daemon
that I don't want to see him!

49:57.177 --> 49:59.710
Don't make me hurt you, young boy!

50:20.910 --> 50:23.010
He should have got this job done

50:23.077 --> 50:25.843
when we captured Ertugrul
and his Alps in the forest.

50:26.377 --> 50:29.277
Unfortunately, it was a big mistake.

50:30.377 --> 50:34.610
I don't know what Arabi's relic is

50:34.677 --> 50:39.043
but he destroyed ours to gather it.

50:39.377 --> 50:42.143
Master Petruchio must pay for it.

50:43.377 --> 50:46.210
You have to regain the dignity

50:46.277 --> 50:49.310
that your cult lost
in Antioch and Aleppo, Titus.

50:50.243 --> 50:52.310
I trust you can achieve it
with all my heart.

50:57.043 --> 51:02.010
Do you have any idea about
how Isadora found that poisonous knife?

51:02.577 --> 51:05.777
It is God's divine justice, my son.

51:06.343 --> 51:09.010
Divine justice.

51:12.110 --> 51:13.110
Come in!

51:17.777 --> 51:18.910
Welcome, Shahzada!

51:22.977 --> 51:24.643
What do you want from me?

51:24.843 --> 51:30.577
I just wanted to discuss why you need
to come to Constantinople with me.

51:30.643 --> 51:32.577
I will never be in your service.

51:34.677 --> 51:39.277
Great emperors never serve
to anyone, Shahzada!

51:40.077 --> 51:42.577
And you will be a great emperor.

52:06.810 --> 52:08.043
Dundar Bey!

52:08.377 --> 52:10.877
You are eating like a hungry wolf.

52:11.643 --> 52:13.210
We have been away for a long time.

52:13.310 --> 52:16.843
Let's act like a wolf so that
friends and foes see that I am back.

52:16.910 --> 52:21.643
Dundar Bey!
People say you almost ate the Templars.

52:24.177 --> 52:26.143
Boar meat is not halal to us, brother.

52:35.710 --> 52:38.843
Almighty! We are grateful
for all your blessings.

52:39.943 --> 52:41.877
You reunited us.

52:42.877 --> 52:46.610
You protected our home, our nomad camp
from the evil of the enemies.

52:47.643 --> 52:49.843
We appreciate.

52:49.910 --> 52:51.843
-Amen.
-Amen.

52:53.143 --> 52:57.010
Ertugrul! We need to gather
the nomad group immediately.

52:59.377 --> 53:00.610
You're right, brother.

53:01.343 --> 53:04.777
Our people are disorganized.
We need to provide order.

53:06.077 --> 53:08.243
We will achieve it
with the help of God.

53:08.710 --> 53:10.310
No one can stand in our way.

53:11.210 --> 53:13.710
However, first things first.

53:13.810 --> 53:16.877
You and Halime Sultan
need to get married.

53:45.610 --> 53:47.043
Let me get some water!

53:47.310 --> 53:50.777
-I can get some for you, mother!
-No, I got it.

54:05.910 --> 54:06.910
Gokce!

54:11.777 --> 54:13.210
Yes, mother!
Do you need something?

54:18.377 --> 54:21.843
My beautiful Gokce. My sunshine!

54:28.077 --> 54:30.643
Mother, please forgive me!

54:31.277 --> 54:32.910
I can't resist him!

54:34.910 --> 54:37.043
My heart hurts!
I just can't.

54:44.843 --> 54:46.277
My beautiful daughter.

54:48.310 --> 54:51.177
You are destined to suffer from it.

54:52.343 --> 54:55.277
With permission of God,
you will find a man who loves you.

54:56.143 --> 55:00.077
And you will love him deeply, too.

55:04.377 --> 55:07.310
Come on!
Wipe your tears.

55:42.943 --> 55:44.243
Thank God!

55:48.143 --> 55:49.143
So?

55:50.710 --> 55:53.877
I had told you my beautiful daughter.

55:53.943 --> 55:57.743
We get through these cloudy days.
We fight our troubles away.

55:57.977 --> 56:02.843
Don't be afraid of the winter,
Flowers bloom when the spring arrives.

56:02.910 --> 56:05.677
Didn't I tell you that
the day follows the night?

56:06.643 --> 56:08.143
Thank God, father.

56:09.977 --> 56:12.210
Thank God.

56:16.177 --> 56:17.743
My children!

56:19.210 --> 56:21.777
I am so close
to the end of my mortal life.

56:23.843 --> 56:28.377
I wish to see you married
before I pass away.

56:30.843 --> 56:33.210
But things are very complicated
these days.

56:34.577 --> 56:36.243
We can't afford a wedding ceremony.

56:40.610 --> 56:44.943
We were just planning
to ask for your permission, father.

56:47.343 --> 56:49.077
Thanks be to God.

56:50.177 --> 56:51.910
Thanks be to God.

56:53.077 --> 56:54.677
Thanks be to God.

56:55.810 --> 56:56.810
Turgut?

56:56.877 --> 56:58.777
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

56:58.843 --> 56:59.943
My son.

57:00.010 --> 57:01.943
-Turgut!
-Take my hand.

57:02.310 --> 57:05.010
-Father?
-Give us some water.

57:05.077 --> 57:06.343
Bring water.

57:06.577 --> 57:09.310
Turgut?

57:11.610 --> 57:12.743
Drink some.

57:17.810 --> 57:20.210
-Turgut!
-Turgut!

57:20.977 --> 57:22.910
Open your eyes, my son.
Open your eyes.

57:22.977 --> 57:24.677
Father, what are we going to do?

57:53.377 --> 57:56.210
Bey! Turgut is having an attack.
He is in Otacı's tent.

57:58.877 --> 57:59.877
Excuse me, Bey!

58:05.777 --> 58:07.177
Elhamdulillah!

58:08.177 --> 58:11.177
Elhamdulillah for everything
you send, my God.

58:26.910 --> 58:32.843
His body reacted because he hasn't taken
Templars' poison for a long time.

58:38.710 --> 58:40.077
Is he going to be okay?

58:59.043 --> 59:00.243
What happened?

59:00.310 --> 59:03.277
His body needs Templars' elixir.

59:04.177 --> 59:06.943
He has resisted to take it
for a long time.

59:09.577 --> 59:12.877
But, his body can't resist it any more.

59:19.910 --> 59:23.910
-What do we need to do, then?
-Shall we give him some if necessary?

59:26.643 --> 59:29.643
He will always need it
if we give him some more.

59:30.177 --> 59:34.577
And, he will be closer to death each day.
We need to be patient.

59:39.910 --> 59:44.110
God will be in his aid
with his name, El Shafi.

59:44.710 --> 59:45.877
God help him.

59:50.843 --> 59:55.243
We've done everything that we can.
Now, it is time to wait.

01:00:24.677 --> 01:00:28.843
We found our brother but this sickness
wants to take him apart from us again.

01:00:30.677 --> 01:00:32.677
These Templars are so coward.

01:00:33.243 --> 01:00:36.010
They rely on poison
as they are too coward to fight.

01:00:36.343 --> 01:00:40.310
They are everywhere.
They are full of tricks.

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:45.677
Their power comes from Muslims' weakness.

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:49.943
They are wicked cats
seeing lions in the mirror.

01:00:50.877 --> 01:00:52.177
They try to spread fear.

01:00:54.077 --> 01:00:57.310
But they could not defeat us
and they won't be able to.

01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:02.877
If they are everywhere, so are we.

01:01:10.577 --> 01:01:15.143
Brothers! Can you excuse me
to have a word with Afsin Bey?

01:01:34.143 --> 01:01:35.910
I am all ears, Ertugrul Bey.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.777
Now tell me who you are, Afsin Bey!

01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:43.343
Where did you come from?
And, why are you here?

01:01:44.843 --> 01:01:48.043
I was in Ahlat with the elderly.

01:01:49.243 --> 01:01:53.277
Ertugrul Bey, Turkish tribes and states
have been born and grown

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:56.010
in the hands of the elderly
ever since the Oghuz Khan.

01:01:56.077 --> 01:01:58.010
This will stay the same in the future.

01:01:59.243 --> 01:02:03.943
Ahlat is our gateway to Anatolia
and the elderly stay there.

01:02:05.343 --> 01:02:09.210
-I have a message from them for you.
-What is it?

01:02:09.377 --> 01:02:14.710
Mongolians are getting stronger.
We must gather all Oghuz tribes together.

01:02:14.777 --> 01:02:18.610
They ask you to take
the Kayi tribe back to Anatolia.

01:02:20.577 --> 01:02:26.210
-Does my father know the elderly?
-It's a rare opportunity, Ertugrul Bey.

01:02:27.943 --> 01:02:32.143
-I wish to know them.
-It is only possible if they wish.

01:02:33.377 --> 01:02:36.643
We have to move the Kayi tribe
to Anatolia as soon as possible.

01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:39.310
Mongolians are approaching
like a raged bull.

01:02:41.877 --> 01:02:44.843
We need soldiers to stop them.

01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:09.110
Your slit black eyes now taken by sleep.

01:03:11.243 --> 01:03:12.277
Let them open.

01:03:16.277 --> 01:03:19.043
Your twelve healthy bones
have been broken.

01:03:20.977 --> 01:03:22.077
Let them heal.

01:03:27.877 --> 01:03:32.710
Your soul all but flown from your frame.

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:35.810
Let it return.

01:03:38.977 --> 01:03:43.310
If your body retains any life,
let me know.

01:03:44.843 --> 01:03:47.910
Let my poor luckless head
be a sacrifice to you.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:56.643
Kazilik Mountain, your waters still flow;
Let them, I pray, cease their flowing.

01:03:59.743 --> 01:04:06.110
Kazilik Mountain, your grasses still grow;
Let them, I pray, cease their growing.

01:04:09.177 --> 01:04:13.843
Kazilik Mountain,
your deer still run fast.

01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:16.277
Let them cease running,

01:04:18.177 --> 01:04:19.877
and turn into stone.

01:04:22.577 --> 01:04:28.043
How can I know, my son,
if it was lion or a tiger?

01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:30.810
How can I know, my son?

01:04:32.877 --> 01:04:36.610
How did this accident happen to you?

01:04:38.677 --> 01:04:43.377
If your life is still in your body,
my son, let me know.

01:04:46.677 --> 01:04:49.143
Let my poor luckless head
be a sacrifice to you.

01:04:51.377 --> 01:04:55.043
Speak a few words to me now.

01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:37.177
Bismillah. Good appetite.

01:06:50.077 --> 01:06:56.177
-Visit the loom to check the girls today.
-Sure.

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:06.810
We should give Gokce in marriage soon
so that she forgets about Ertugrul.

01:07:07.943 --> 01:07:08.977
You are right, Bey.

01:07:15.177 --> 01:07:16.177
Are you okay, Hatun?

01:07:18.377 --> 01:07:19.877
Why are you asking, Bey?

01:07:20.777 --> 01:07:22.877
You act like an angel this morning.

01:07:23.243 --> 01:07:25.777
I tell you to go to the loom
and you don't reject.

01:07:26.577 --> 01:07:29.377
I tell you we should give Gokce
in marriage, no objections.

01:07:29.677 --> 01:07:30.677
What's going on?

01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:33.810
Whatever you wish, Bey!

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:39.310
My Goodness. So weird.

01:07:39.377 --> 01:07:41.310
The world is falling apart.

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:24.843
-Long live, Bey!
-Thank you.

01:08:30.577 --> 01:08:33.143
-Bey.
-Oh, Wild Demir.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:37.043
-Thank God, we have reached good days.
-Thank God.

01:08:37.677 --> 01:08:43.577
-How is Turgut Alp?
-Fine, Bey. Nothing to do but to wait.

01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:51.643
Bey, should you accept to listen,
I would like to tell you something.

01:08:54.343 --> 01:08:56.677
I want Turgut and Aykiz to get married.

01:08:57.610 --> 01:08:59.710
They have been waiting far too long.

01:08:59.877 --> 01:09:03.143
I am also aware that it is not
the greatest time for a wedding,

01:09:03.643 --> 01:09:05.377
considering we have a lot of problems.

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:07.377
You are right!

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:09.877
Our kids are in misery.

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:13.643
We get it done as soon as
Turgut Alp recovers.

01:09:14.243 --> 01:09:15.743
May God bless you, Bey.

01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:36.277
As Salam Alaykum
wa Rahmatullah.

01:09:37.077 --> 01:09:39.077
As Salam Alaykum
wa Rahmatullah.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:42.943
May I come in, Sheik?

01:09:44.777 --> 01:09:45.810
Of course, my daughter!

01:09:56.077 --> 01:09:58.677
I want to talk to you
if you care to listen.

01:09:59.577 --> 01:10:00.910
Sure! Please be seated.

01:10:17.710 --> 01:10:20.910
Efendi! I did bad things.

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:26.043
I harmed a lot of people
and acted evil.

01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:30.577
I'd like to retreat
from my sins and repent.

01:10:31.877 --> 01:10:34.343
God's doors for repentance
are always wide open.

01:10:35.243 --> 01:10:39.177
Beg God for forgiveness
and acceptance of your repentance.

01:10:40.877 --> 01:10:45.910
However, you say you harmed people.

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:51.310
You must talk to them
and demand forgiveness.

01:10:53.943 --> 01:10:57.577
Do not pass away
before you ask for forgiveness.

01:10:58.943 --> 01:11:02.143
Because God does not forgive
one another's rights.

01:11:09.377 --> 01:11:13.777
My dear sisters!
We  finally have peace among our people.

01:11:14.643 --> 01:11:16.977
Now it is time for us to work hard.

01:11:17.677 --> 01:11:19.177
Bismillah!

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:23.843
Halime, my daughter!
You are responsible for the prints.

01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:26.977
You must search meadows,
find beautiful flowers,

01:11:27.043 --> 01:11:28.177
and extract their colors.

01:11:28.243 --> 01:11:32.210
Do not worry, Mother Hayme.
We will surely do our best.

01:11:32.743 --> 01:11:36.010
Gokce, my daughter.
You shall be checking the looms.

01:11:36.077 --> 01:11:38.743
We must get carpets ready
to be sold in Aleppo.

01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:39.877
Sure, mother!

01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:41.277
Take it easy, Hatuns.

01:11:41.743 --> 01:11:45.310
-Oh, welcome Bey.
-Thank you.

01:11:47.043 --> 01:11:50.210
-Please be seated, father.
-Thank you, I won't stay too long.

01:11:51.277 --> 01:11:53.177
I just wanted to see Bacis.

01:11:54.277 --> 01:11:57.210
So, Hayme Hatun?
How are things here?

01:11:58.143 --> 01:12:01.743
They have promised. Everything
will be ready for Aleppo Bazaar.

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:06.277
If God permits, Aleppo Bazaar will be
ornamented with Kayi Bacis' handcrafts.

01:12:06.343 --> 01:12:08.277
If God permits, Bey!

01:12:09.043 --> 01:12:13.010
Bey, we can get everything done
under your command.

01:12:13.377 --> 01:12:14.743
Thank you all, Bacis.

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:18.610
If you have complaints
about your husbands,

01:12:18.677 --> 01:12:22.143
you should know that
I am always ready to listen to you!

01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:58.877
-How are they doing?
-They are distracted, Bey.

01:12:58.943 --> 01:13:01.643
We must train them
to be Alps in no time.

01:13:04.977 --> 01:13:09.377
Alps seem to have forgotten how to fight
while electing Bey in the headquarters.

01:13:10.277 --> 01:13:14.210
Train them day and night
and get them ready to fight.

01:13:14.943 --> 01:13:16.010
As you wish, Bey.

01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:19.710
-As you command, Bey
-May God give you strength.

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:32.143
God be with you, Alps.

01:13:37.077 --> 01:13:38.710
You have honored us, Bey.

01:13:42.777 --> 01:13:47.843
They are a bit distracted
because of Kurtoglu's promises, father!

01:13:49.943 --> 01:13:52.677
We will get our nomad group aligned.

01:13:54.277 --> 01:13:57.110
The threat from enemies
aids the unification.

01:13:57.943 --> 01:14:01.643
It makes us get closer
and keeps us alert.

01:14:02.743 --> 01:14:07.043
It covers our weaknesses!
Keep them in mind, son!

01:14:09.043 --> 01:14:14.043
Should you be the Bey one day,
always keep your nomads ready to fight.

01:14:49.877 --> 01:14:54.210
Thanks God, we have finally
seen a peaceful day.

01:14:54.277 --> 01:14:56.210
-Thanks God.
-Thanks God.

01:14:58.043 --> 01:15:03.377
Even though there are threats from
Templars, crusaders, and others,

01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:08.710
it is important to have
peace at home.

01:15:09.077 --> 01:15:11.810
We are grateful to God
for his blessings.

01:15:11.877 --> 01:15:13.810
-Thanks God!
-Thanks God!

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:18.943
However, we are deeply
sorry for Turgut.

01:15:20.877 --> 01:15:23.310
If God permits,
we will see him recover.

01:15:24.277 --> 01:15:25.910
If God permits, father.

01:15:31.143 --> 01:15:36.910
I suggest that Turgut and Aykiz
shall get married first, Ertugrul.

01:15:37.677 --> 01:15:41.310
-They have waited for too long.
-I was gonna ask you the same, father.

01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:45.110
I would also suggest that
they should get married first.

01:15:46.143 --> 01:15:48.910
We should be quick
with happy events.

01:15:52.343 --> 01:15:56.010
After all these sufferings
and with a broken heart,

01:15:56.610 --> 01:16:01.843
we should proceed with the engagement
even though Shahzada Yigit is a prisoner.

01:16:03.377 --> 01:16:09.743
We cherish our peace so that
we have strength against our enemies.

01:16:10.743 --> 01:16:12.177
-If God permits!
-If God permits!

01:16:12.277 --> 01:16:13.977
Father!

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:18.110
I would like to have some words
with your permission.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:26.377
To have peace in our marquee
and nomad tents,

01:16:27.077 --> 01:16:32.010
all secrets must be revealed, Bey.

01:16:35.077 --> 01:16:37.943
Selcan, what are you talking about?

01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:43.777
Mother! To have peace
in the marquee of a...

01:16:43.843 --> 01:16:48.110
...sacred father and mother like yours.

01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:54.277
You all need to know about my sins.

01:16:54.877 --> 01:16:58.110
Selcan, do you hear what you are saying?

01:17:00.277 --> 01:17:06.310
Gundogdu! I aborted our child
long before you knew of.

01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:11.377
I was too scared to tell you.

01:17:12.877 --> 01:17:15.977
I did something even worse

01:17:16.043 --> 01:17:20.110
and claimed it was because of Aykiz.

01:17:21.377 --> 01:17:22.910
I blamed her for it.

01:17:22.977 --> 01:17:25.843
She was whipped
before the eyes of people.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:30.710
Even though I knew Gokce was infertile,

01:17:32.077 --> 01:17:35.243
I made every effort to see her
married to Ertugrul Bey.

01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:42.577
What have you done, Selcan?

01:17:43.143 --> 01:17:46.243
I wish it were all about it, Bey.

01:17:46.977 --> 01:17:48.877
I did not stop.

01:17:50.710 --> 01:17:53.877
I collaborated with that traitor,
named Kurtoglu

01:17:53.943 --> 01:17:57.310
and spoiled Gundogdu's soul
just to help him to be the Bey.

01:17:58.710 --> 01:18:02.210
Although I knew that there might be
consequences for Gokce

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:06.277
and it might cost
my husband, Gundogdu's life...

01:18:08.577 --> 01:18:11.810
I am sinful in all these.

01:18:11.877 --> 01:18:13.810
Nothing less...

01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:16.277
-Selcan, enough!
-Be seated.

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:22.910
Calm down! Be seated, son!
I want to hear what she says.

01:18:31.361 --> 01:18:33.528
I don't want my darkened and defiled soul

01:18:33.828 --> 01:18:38.728
to dishonor my husband's bed
and my parent's tent.

01:18:41.828 --> 01:18:44.861
I want you to punish me twofold
in the same way I treated did Aykiz.

01:18:46.761 --> 01:18:50.328
I must be punished equally as Kurdoglu.

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:56.528
I am grateful to Ibn Arabi
for not letting me kill myself

01:18:56.928 --> 01:19:01.694
out of grief and commit a bigger sin.

01:19:03.294 --> 01:19:05.494
He told me to tell you everything

01:19:06.294 --> 01:19:08.394
and so I did, without keeping any secrets.

01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:11.594
I am ready for any punishment you see fit.

01:19:23.794 --> 01:19:27.694
Our beloved prophet, peace be upon him

01:19:28.694 --> 01:19:30.761
said in a hadith that

01:19:31.594 --> 01:19:33.694
all men are sinners

01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:38.828
but the most favourables
among sinners are repentants.

01:19:40.394 --> 01:19:43.794
Selcan wants to repent in the Nasuh way.

01:19:45.394 --> 01:19:47.828
She regrets for those she had done before.

01:19:48.961 --> 01:19:51.228
She is determined
to renounce her sins immediately

01:19:51.794 --> 01:19:54.294
and not to repeat them in the future.

01:19:55.928 --> 01:19:59.828
Our beloved prophet, peace be upon him

01:20:00.528 --> 01:20:02.328
describes Nasuh repentance as

01:20:03.794 --> 01:20:06.794
regretting all your sins,

01:20:08.828 --> 01:20:12.361
fully committing yourself to God
and never going back to your sins.

01:20:12.594 --> 01:20:16.394
Just like the milk, which never returns
to the breast once it flows.

01:20:23.894 --> 01:20:27.794
Selcan submits to any punishment
you decide.

01:20:29.294 --> 01:20:32.794
When all secrets were about to be covered
under a veil of lies

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:40.594
Selcan chose to confide her sins
instead of covering them up.

01:20:42.494 --> 01:20:45.628
I advice you to listen to her pure heart.

01:20:59.994 --> 01:21:01.628
Let Gundogdu decide.

01:21:44.694 --> 01:21:47.628
I went to bed with you as my woman!

01:21:49.528 --> 01:21:50.994
How could you do this to me?

01:21:57.461 --> 01:21:59.261
I gave into temptation, Gundogdu.

01:22:00.461 --> 01:22:02.294
Forgive me for God's sake.

01:22:02.894 --> 01:22:04.028
Forgive me!

01:22:07.394 --> 01:22:08.661
Get up, get up.

01:22:10.761 --> 01:22:16.694
I went against my mother and
father for you.

01:22:17.261 --> 01:22:18.494
What have you done?

01:22:18.761 --> 01:22:21.694
You collaborated with that
traitor Kurdoglu.

01:22:22.294 --> 01:22:24.461
How can I forgive you? How?

01:22:39.728 --> 01:22:43.228
We wanted to have a baby!
We tried for years!

01:22:47.761 --> 01:22:49.294
How could you do this to us?

01:22:50.394 --> 01:22:53.028
God, oh my God! You...

01:22:54.294 --> 01:22:55.961
How could you do this

01:22:56.328 --> 01:22:58.861
to the baby inside of you
out of your greed and ambition?

01:23:05.694 --> 01:23:07.761
How am I supposed to take you in my bed
as my woman!

01:23:17.461 --> 01:23:19.994
You will leave this tent tomorrow!

01:23:21.694 --> 01:23:23.828
I will not go to bed with you
as my woman again!

01:23:24.394 --> 01:23:25.994
I am divorcing you!

01:23:26.361 --> 01:23:27.694
No! No!

01:23:27.994 --> 01:23:30.661
Please, kill me! Please, kill me
if you are going to say that word!

01:23:30.894 --> 01:23:33.694
Kill me if you would say it, Gundogdu!
Take it and kill me!

01:23:36.328 --> 01:23:37.628
Kill me!

01:23:39.261 --> 01:23:40.561
Kill me!

01:23:55.028 --> 01:23:56.561
Go to hell.

01:24:24.928 --> 01:24:26.361
Peace be upon you.

01:24:27.694 --> 01:24:29.361
And peace be upon you, Ertugrul.

01:24:35.328 --> 01:24:36.594
Is Turgut Alp well?

01:24:38.928 --> 01:24:40.661
He has always been well, son.

01:24:42.994 --> 01:24:47.728
He always fought with the monsters
that wanted to take away his soul.

01:24:51.294 --> 01:24:54.361
He was imprisoned within himself.
He was alone.

01:24:55.594 --> 01:24:59.228
He could never ask for help or guidance.

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:05.028
The conflict between him and his enemy
that wanted to take his soul was so strong

01:25:06.561 --> 01:25:11.628
he prayed to God, chanting his name
in the dungeon they put him.

01:25:12.528 --> 01:25:14.794
He has already been one of
the victors, my son.

01:25:15.761 --> 01:25:20.861
Now God will have mercy on him once again
as "The Healer" is one of his many names.

01:25:28.461 --> 01:25:31.561
I would like to talk to you about Omer.

01:25:51.594 --> 01:25:52.694
My daughter.

01:25:59.028 --> 01:26:01.894
Are the rumours true, father?
Has Dundar really healed?

01:26:04.428 --> 01:26:06.894
He got up as if nothing has happened.

01:26:08.428 --> 01:26:10.428
He is like a blade quenched in water.

01:26:11.294 --> 01:26:13.728
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

01:26:14.694 --> 01:26:16.628
-Father.
-Tell me, my daugther.

01:26:17.294 --> 01:26:21.394
They say that the evil eye on the marquee
was lifted after Selcan's confession.

01:26:23.494 --> 01:26:25.528
Not only the one on our marquee

01:26:26.394 --> 01:26:28.661
but also the evil eye on our nomad tent
was lifted with God's will.

01:26:29.994 --> 01:26:31.594
Turgut will get better, too.

01:26:33.728 --> 01:26:35.028
If God permits, father.

01:26:39.461 --> 01:26:42.394
What about her? What will they do to her?

01:26:43.894 --> 01:26:46.694
Can they forgive her
after all the harm she has done?

01:26:47.028 --> 01:26:49.261
Nobody knows what will happen,
my daughter.

01:26:50.328 --> 01:26:53.894
Thank God, Ibn Arabi is here,
if it wasn't for him...

01:26:55.761 --> 01:26:58.661
Gundogdu Bey's situation is
very difficult.

01:26:59.894 --> 01:27:01.861
Even thinking about it is agony.

01:27:02.561 --> 01:27:04.728
May God help them.
-Amen.

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:15.894
-How is Turgut?
-He is the same, my Bey.

01:27:31.894 --> 01:27:33.028
Bey.

01:27:36.028 --> 01:27:37.294
My lad.

01:27:39.661 --> 01:27:40.794
My brother.

01:27:44.461 --> 01:27:46.594
Turgut, my son.

01:27:51.961 --> 01:27:53.294
Aykiz.

01:27:57.928 --> 01:27:59.694
Thank God for his mercy.

01:28:18.428 --> 01:28:20.294
I will leave tonight with your permission.

01:28:25.894 --> 01:28:27.294
If you are still alive

01:28:28.661 --> 01:28:30.628
know that it is thanks to Arabi.

01:28:34.494 --> 01:28:35.961
Do whatever you want.

01:28:37.661 --> 01:28:39.361
Be away from me and closer to God.

01:29:08.661 --> 01:29:09.728
Sister.

01:29:25.728 --> 01:29:27.528
Don't you hate me?

01:29:32.361 --> 01:29:33.728
You were my mother...

01:29:35.728 --> 01:29:38.461
...father and sister.

01:29:41.361 --> 01:29:42.728
You were everything to me.

01:29:45.428 --> 01:29:47.894
But I feel like you ripped
everything away from me.

01:29:51.528 --> 01:29:54.728
I lost Ertugrul. I lost my heart.

01:30:00.761 --> 01:30:02.794
Yet you killed a human being
inside of you.

01:30:15.694 --> 01:30:17.261
My dear sister.

01:30:19.561 --> 01:30:20.761
Gokce.

01:31:06.861 --> 01:31:10.594
Don't you still trust me?
What kind of a stubbornness is that, Alps?

01:31:13.394 --> 01:31:15.794
I do not know what you said
to convince Ertugrul Bey.

01:31:17.661 --> 01:31:19.261
But you cannot convince me.

01:31:21.428 --> 01:31:24.728
Even your stubbornness is nice.
I cannot get mad at you.

01:31:26.994 --> 01:31:28.361
But...

01:31:30.461 --> 01:31:32.428
...I don't know what do you have
against me, Dogan?

01:31:33.761 --> 01:31:35.261
I do not trust you, Afsin Bey.

01:31:36.694 --> 01:31:39.894
I trust Selcan Hatun
but I do not trust you.

01:31:41.861 --> 01:31:46.561
She confessed everything one by one
out of regret.

01:31:48.228 --> 01:31:49.528
But you are not like her.

01:31:50.294 --> 01:31:53.361
I am afraid that some day
you will bring us together with Titus

01:31:54.228 --> 01:31:56.294
claiming that he is
important to the state.

01:31:58.794 --> 01:32:05.228
You showed up when our nomad group was in
deep trouble.

01:32:07.861 --> 01:32:09.328
But heaven knows why

01:32:09.561 --> 01:32:12.861
Halime Sultan's father was murdered
after couple of days.

01:32:14.761 --> 01:32:15.928
You were nowhere to be found.

01:32:23.661 --> 01:32:25.661
Dogan, Bamsi.

01:32:29.994 --> 01:32:33.861
Afsin Bey has my and Ertugrul Bey's
full confidence.

01:32:35.861 --> 01:32:39.794
You know that he was an
important commander in Seljuk Empire.

01:32:41.628 --> 01:32:43.661
We do not want bad blood between you.

01:32:44.661 --> 01:32:49.294
Besides, Suleyman Shah asked him
to come with us. Do I make myself clear?

01:32:50.561 --> 01:32:51.794
I understood, my Bey.

01:32:53.794 --> 01:32:57.028
Not quite, but so be it, my Bey.

01:32:58.828 --> 01:32:59.961
Alright then.

01:33:01.028 --> 01:33:02.394
Where is Ertugrul?

01:33:03.428 --> 01:33:05.861
He went to visit Turgut Alp.
He will be back soon.

01:33:13.428 --> 01:33:14.494
How is Turgut?

01:33:15.328 --> 01:33:16.861
Thank God, he woke up.

01:33:17.728 --> 01:33:18.861
Shall we?

01:34:10.528 --> 01:34:11.728
Do you have time, mother?

01:34:13.661 --> 01:34:14.794
Yes, Selcan.

01:34:16.728 --> 01:34:18.628
Gundogdu cast me out from his tent.

01:34:19.794 --> 01:34:21.494
I will look for another tent.

01:34:23.228 --> 01:34:24.928
You should be thankful
that he did not divorce you.

01:34:28.294 --> 01:34:29.861
Can Gokce stay with you?

01:34:30.961 --> 01:34:35.394
Please do not judge my sister by my deeds.

01:34:35.994 --> 01:34:40.361
We know what to see in a person very well.
Don't worry about it.

01:34:40.828 --> 01:34:42.761
Come on, sisters! Hurry up!

01:34:44.928 --> 01:34:47.594
Water is boiling!
Throw in the flowers! Hurry!

01:35:24.728 --> 01:35:26.961
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you, Ertugrul Bey.

01:35:34.728 --> 01:35:37.261
Brother, meet Omer.

01:35:40.894 --> 01:35:45.494
Ibn Arabi said that he is a brave warrior
honored with Islam.

01:35:48.961 --> 01:35:50.694
-Welcome.
-I am honored.

01:35:53.794 --> 01:35:54.894
I am honored, Omer.

01:36:02.361 --> 01:36:06.928
Cardinal Thomas wants to take
Shahzade Yigit to Constantinople.

01:36:08.261 --> 01:36:10.561
I wanted to break him out of the dungeon

01:36:11.861 --> 01:36:13.594
but it was not possible.

01:36:15.661 --> 01:36:16.861
What about Isadora?

01:36:21.828 --> 01:36:24.428
Unfortunately, The Master killed her, too.

01:36:28.428 --> 01:36:29.561
She was a brave woman.

01:36:30.628 --> 01:36:33.328
I will avenge her father and sister.

01:36:36.828 --> 01:36:39.328
Cardinal will replace
The Master with Titus

01:36:39.561 --> 01:36:41.894
with the help of the
members of the council.

01:36:43.661 --> 01:36:48.994
Both of them do not want Kayi tribe
to get in their way before the Crusade.

01:36:50.694 --> 01:36:52.594
They will attack your nomad tribe.

01:36:55.661 --> 01:36:57.728
Will they cross the border
and attack the tribe?

01:36:58.328 --> 01:36:59.328
Yes.

01:37:04.628 --> 01:37:06.861
-May the faster one win.
-Exactly, brother.

01:37:08.261 --> 01:37:11.961
We should hurry up and
raze that castle to ground.

01:37:13.628 --> 01:37:16.294
Isadora drew everything we need
to get inside the castle.

01:37:17.428 --> 01:37:22.528
We know how to get inside the tunnels
and navigate through the castle.

01:37:23.661 --> 01:37:26.261
And most importantly,
you will be inside, Omer.

01:37:28.261 --> 01:37:29.561
Do not worry, my Bey.

01:37:30.494 --> 01:37:32.028
I will do whatever it takes.

01:37:50.028 --> 01:37:51.361
Have your fill, my son, eat.

01:37:54.894 --> 01:37:56.494
Mother, I will explode
if I take one more bite.

01:37:56.761 --> 01:37:58.994
Son, we have fed you
with water for months.

01:37:59.561 --> 01:38:02.394
Eat to put some muscle on you.
Eat, come on.

01:38:06.528 --> 01:38:09.394
He will be his mother's Alp, my brave son.

01:38:10.561 --> 01:38:12.828
Father, I would like to see the
new nomad tents with your permission.

01:38:15.794 --> 01:38:19.294
Alright son, you may go.
You would burn what you ate too.

01:38:19.528 --> 01:38:20.628
Thank you, father.

01:38:24.928 --> 01:38:30.228
Dundar, take it easy and
hold onto what you ate. Alright?

01:38:30.461 --> 01:38:33.394
Son, did you hear me?
-Alright, mother.

01:38:44.728 --> 01:38:47.661
Bey, what are we going to do about Selcan?

01:38:48.728 --> 01:38:50.794
Gundogdu told her to leave his tent.

01:38:51.728 --> 01:38:52.994
What did you say to him?

01:38:53.828 --> 01:38:58.594
I told him to give us some time
for things to settle down.

01:38:59.628 --> 01:39:00.928
What do you say?

01:39:02.394 --> 01:39:05.628
I don't know what to do
or what to say, Hayme.

01:39:08.294 --> 01:39:11.428
I do not know after all these years

01:39:12.794 --> 01:39:16.528
if we have been raising
a traitor or a dutiful child.

01:39:18.561 --> 01:39:22.294
I would have killed her in my marquee
if it was not for Ibn Arabi.

01:39:23.694 --> 01:39:25.261
I am not that merciful.

01:39:26.828 --> 01:39:32.628
Maybe she was behind everything
that happened to Turgut and Dundar.

01:39:35.828 --> 01:39:37.828
Gundogdu is devastated.

01:39:38.928 --> 01:39:40.728
He does not know what to do.

01:39:41.828 --> 01:39:44.628
Let us wait and hope for the best.

01:39:58.461 --> 01:39:59.761
You should rest, sir.

01:40:02.428 --> 01:40:04.361
I will represent you in the best way.

01:40:59.994 --> 01:41:00.994
Yes, Titus.

01:41:02.394 --> 01:41:04.694
What do you have to say about
the recent events?

01:41:05.928 --> 01:41:11.828
It was a very big mistake trying to banish
Kayi tribe to where they came from.

01:41:13.028 --> 01:41:15.894
We should have killed them all
when we had the chance.

01:41:16.728 --> 01:41:19.328
Do you have any suggestions, Knight Titus?

01:41:20.694 --> 01:41:22.261
Yes, I do.

01:41:24.928 --> 01:41:29.961
We will not rest until Kayi tribe
drowns in their own blood.

01:41:34.994 --> 01:41:39.528
They will perish to the last man,
including the babies in their cradles

01:41:41.461 --> 01:41:43.361
so that our sacred duty will come to life.

01:41:44.994 --> 01:41:48.961
What does Cardinal Thomas say about this?

01:41:53.361 --> 01:41:56.261
He would like to host you in his
chambers and discuss that matter.

01:41:59.494 --> 01:42:00.994
If you deem appropriate that is.

01:42:30.294 --> 01:42:32.894
Dogan. Tell Wild Demir
to come to the marquee.

01:42:33.594 --> 01:42:34.594
Yes, my Bey.

01:43:06.394 --> 01:43:07.828
Do you have any news from Omer?

01:43:10.528 --> 01:43:12.761
-Yes, my Bey.
-Good news?

01:43:14.661 --> 01:43:15.894
The news are not good, my Bey.

01:43:37.561 --> 01:43:39.594
Ertugrul Bey summons you
to the marquee, Wild Demir.

01:43:39.894 --> 01:43:42.894
-What is the matter?
-News are not good, Wild Demir.

01:43:53.461 --> 01:43:55.261
How is my brother, Aykiz?

01:44:37.594 --> 01:44:39.594
My dear friend, Petruchio.

01:44:40.961 --> 01:44:43.728
Such a great, divine man.

01:44:45.028 --> 01:44:50.894
But the crusaders need a young
and inspiring hero

01:44:51.594 --> 01:44:57.028
to rally us all around him instead of a
hero in deathbed like him.

01:44:58.228 --> 01:44:59.561
And that hero is...

01:45:01.394 --> 01:45:03.761
...Titus himself.

01:45:26.428 --> 01:45:28.228
That castle must be razed down
on the crusaders

01:45:28.394 --> 01:45:29.961
if we are going to ensure
our tribes future.

01:45:31.794 --> 01:45:33.228
There is no other way.

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:37.994
They wanted to banish us from these
heavenly lands by using Kurdoglu.

01:45:38.528 --> 01:45:40.261
Thank God, they failed.

01:45:40.428 --> 01:45:44.461
From now on, their only goal
will be to kill us all.

01:45:46.894 --> 01:45:47.961
Wild Demir.

01:45:49.294 --> 01:45:54.928
Bey, I took a look at the drawings
Isadora brought.

01:45:57.028 --> 01:45:58.894
What you ask is possible.

01:45:59.694 --> 01:46:03.461
It can be done, but I do not know
how much it is going to take

01:46:03.628 --> 01:46:04.961
to open that blocked tunnels.

01:46:05.494 --> 01:46:06.994
If we are going to do this

01:46:07.628 --> 01:46:09.628
those in the castle
must be completely unaware of it.

01:46:10.461 --> 01:46:11.861
Is this possible, Ertugrul?

01:46:12.461 --> 01:46:15.561
If we lay siege to the castle,
we can do it.

01:46:16.228 --> 01:46:17.694
If we do it they cannot get out

01:46:17.961 --> 01:46:20.428
or send message to
their wretched brothers.

01:46:21.494 --> 01:46:22.794
While the castle is under siege

01:46:22.994 --> 01:46:25.728
we can dig the tunnels secretly
and infiltrate the castle.

01:46:38.794 --> 01:46:42.328
The number of our knights are not as much
as the Alps of Kayi tribe.

01:46:43.861 --> 01:46:46.628
A sudden raid will surely
provide us a big advantage

01:46:46.961 --> 01:46:50.594
but I don't want to put the war
in jeopardy.

01:46:52.828 --> 01:46:54.494
What are you suggesting, Titus?

01:46:57.794 --> 01:47:00.461
I will call for a legion
from Principality of Antioch.

01:47:01.294 --> 01:47:03.561
A legion of 800 archers

01:47:04.428 --> 01:47:07.594
will ease our cavaliers'
and footmens' work.

01:47:08.494 --> 01:47:10.561
I will also muster
300 knights from Cyprus.

01:47:13.228 --> 01:47:15.328
Where will you find the ships from, Titus?

01:47:16.628 --> 01:47:17.961
They are also ready, sir.

01:47:19.794 --> 01:47:22.294
I know that 15 galiots
Emperor Frederick sent

01:47:23.028 --> 01:47:24.961
are located at the Kyrenian Harbor.

01:47:25.994 --> 01:47:27.961
The navarch is going to do
what is necessary.

01:47:28.961 --> 01:47:32.594
The ships will be in Alexandretta
in a week.

01:47:42.261 --> 01:47:43.928
There are cliffs at the backside
of the castle, Bey.

01:47:44.394 --> 01:47:46.028
Access is possible only through the front.

01:47:46.528 --> 01:47:48.694
Accesses to the tunnels are
from the left and right sides.

01:47:59.594 --> 01:48:01.261
If we surround the castle...

01:48:03.428 --> 01:48:07.394
...from here and here, we have a chance
to get in from the tunnels.

01:48:12.694 --> 01:48:14.594
Can we get inside of this castle,
Wild Demir?

01:48:15.961 --> 01:48:19.761
Bey, I need to see the tunnels
with my own eyes.

01:48:21.228 --> 01:48:24.394
You and Afsin go and take a look
at the castle.

01:48:26.861 --> 01:48:27.961
Yes, my Bey.

01:48:29.394 --> 01:48:30.528
Ertugrul...

01:48:31.928 --> 01:48:33.928
...we must prepare our Alps for battle.

01:48:35.028 --> 01:48:37.461
They are probably preparing
to attack us, too.

01:48:38.961 --> 01:48:40.761
Reinforce the defences of the tribe also.

01:48:44.828 --> 01:48:47.028
You want us to be ready for
attack and defence, Bey.

01:48:49.228 --> 01:48:52.861
Gundogdu, you will try to find
coin for the battle.

01:48:53.994 --> 01:48:57.328
We need gold for weapons and subsistence.

01:48:58.228 --> 01:49:01.528
We can get the necessary weapons
with the gold we found in the tents

01:49:01.861 --> 01:49:03.528
of Kurdoglu and his Beys, father.

01:49:04.594 --> 01:49:07.894
Our goal will be to kill them all
using their own gold.

01:49:11.994 --> 01:49:13.528
May God grant us victory.

01:49:14.361 --> 01:49:15.861
The war has begun.

01:49:16.561 --> 01:49:18.828
We will move after Turgut Alp's wedding.

01:50:35.661 --> 01:50:39.328
I told you that Ertugrul
would cause trouble.

01:50:42.228 --> 01:50:43.961
We had a big opportunity.

01:50:46.328 --> 01:50:49.427
We should have killed him and his Alps
when we had the chance in the forest.

01:50:51.328 --> 01:50:52.861
We could have gotten rid of them all.

01:50:56.294 --> 01:50:57.561
But what have you done?

01:50:59.228 --> 01:51:04.261
You missed the opportunity
for the chest of Ibn Arabi.

01:51:10.528 --> 01:51:13.994
If Ertugrul had died
you would be alive now.

01:51:15.461 --> 01:51:17.328
You would be in your office.

01:51:29.628 --> 01:51:30.894
It is too late now.

01:51:37.761 --> 01:51:40.694
That chest, we do not even know
what's inside of it

01:51:42.361 --> 01:51:44.394
has already defeated us.

01:51:47.561 --> 01:51:49.494
Only because of your stupidity.

01:51:56.694 --> 01:51:59.628
Go to hell, Petruchio Manzini.

01:53:08.028 --> 01:53:09.961
I met with Ibn Arabi, sir.

01:53:10.628 --> 01:53:13.394
He said that he would go to Damascus
in a couple of days.

01:53:15.361 --> 01:53:17.528
He wants me to go with him.

01:53:17.994 --> 01:53:20.494
-Will the chest be with him?
-Yes, sir.

01:53:21.661 --> 01:53:22.894
That is good.

01:53:23.694 --> 01:53:26.728
I will go to Constantinople
with the little Shahzade.

01:53:27.594 --> 01:53:28.994
I will meet you there.

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:56.261
Halime Sultan buried the chest here.

01:53:56.861 --> 01:53:59.394
I did not touch it. I wanted you to know.

01:54:00.594 --> 01:54:04.728
Thank you, son.
I knew that it was in safe hands.

01:54:06.961 --> 01:54:09.861
That chest, I do not know
what is inside of it

01:54:11.461 --> 01:54:12.728
and I do not wonder about it.

01:54:13.361 --> 01:54:18.728
But both Black Priest Thomas
and The Templars are after it.

01:54:20.228 --> 01:54:22.561
They quarrel among each other
because of it.

01:54:23.594 --> 01:54:27.361
Our chest saved you
and your Alps' life, son.

01:54:30.494 --> 01:54:33.528
Titus wanted to kill me
when they caught us

01:54:34.828 --> 01:54:36.728
but The Master did not let him do it.

01:54:38.361 --> 01:54:40.861
We are alive thanks to your chest.

01:54:44.294 --> 01:54:46.228
If you wonder what is inside of it

01:54:47.028 --> 01:54:49.728
I would say it is something
that has been entrusted to me.

01:54:51.228 --> 01:54:55.394
As I told you, leave it here
until I leave the tribe.

01:54:56.361 --> 01:54:57.561
As you wish.

01:55:03.461 --> 01:55:05.561
I heared that you will lay siege
to the castle.

01:55:07.494 --> 01:55:11.761
May God grant you victory.
May God give you strenght, son.

01:55:14.694 --> 01:55:15.694
Amen.

01:55:36.994 --> 01:55:38.461
I want to know something.

01:55:40.728 --> 01:55:44.561
Didn't you have a twinge of conscience
when you did all those evil things?

01:55:47.828 --> 01:55:49.661
I would not be able to if I did.

01:55:52.361 --> 01:55:55.028
My father kept coming to me.

01:55:56.894 --> 01:55:58.728
I wanted to avenge him.

01:56:01.694 --> 01:56:04.494
Now everyone will ostracize me
as if I have the plague, because of you.

01:56:05.961 --> 01:56:07.328
Gokce!

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:10.994
You defiled our honor
just like our father did.

01:56:15.428 --> 01:56:16.561
You are right.

01:56:18.028 --> 01:56:24.461
But from now on my tongue will be mute
and my eyes will be blind.

01:56:26.794 --> 01:56:30.994
From now on, nobody will be harmed
because of me.

01:56:40.294 --> 01:56:42.228
I do not want to see you
for a while, sister.

01:56:44.828 --> 01:56:49.494
I don't want to ponder about
your evil deeds and hate you even more.

01:57:22.902 --> 01:57:24.635
Welcome mad boy.

01:57:26.502 --> 01:57:27.868
You are still like a bear.

01:57:27.935 --> 01:57:29.568
My brothers.

01:57:29.802 --> 01:57:31.735
I have missed fighting with you.

01:57:32.335 --> 01:57:34.602
I hope, we shall fight with the enemy
soon.

01:57:37.402 --> 01:57:39.568
If I do not take revenge from
The Templars...

01:57:39.735 --> 01:57:41.535
...I shall die in disappointment.

01:57:41.602 --> 01:57:44.702
You have a wedding tonight and you are
still wrestling us here.

01:57:45.302 --> 01:57:47.068
Pull yourself together.

01:57:47.402 --> 01:57:50.435
Otherwise Aykiz shall say,
"What have I done?

01:57:50.602 --> 01:57:53.368
Have I waited for this the whole time?"

01:58:02.668 --> 01:58:05.668
Brother, I do not have the dignity
to talk to my father or mother.

01:58:08.968 --> 01:58:11.102
They do not talk to me too.

01:58:12.602 --> 01:58:14.368
I do not know what to do.

01:58:18.968 --> 01:58:20.935
Do not leave Selcan Hatun alone, brother.

01:58:21.502 --> 01:58:24.902
No matter what she had done obviously
she is regretful.

01:58:25.402 --> 01:58:26.668
She seeks the right way.

01:58:27.935 --> 01:58:32.368
Ibn Arabi showed her the right way.
She needs your support too.

01:58:32.735 --> 01:58:34.535
Give her a little more time.

01:58:40.802 --> 01:58:42.535
Oh my brother.

01:59:14.468 --> 01:59:15.968
You are so lovely, Aykiz.

01:59:20.902 --> 01:59:22.502
I thank you girls.

01:59:22.668 --> 01:59:24.768
I wish all of your desires come true.

01:59:25.935 --> 01:59:27.368
You were patient.

01:59:27.502 --> 01:59:29.668
You have found happiness at the end,
Aykiz.

01:59:30.502 --> 01:59:33.502
You and Ertugrul Bey shall unite too,
Halime Sultan.

01:59:36.502 --> 01:59:37.602
If God permits.

01:59:40.668 --> 01:59:43.035
Is my cap ready, Gokce Hatun?
Let us put it on too.

01:59:43.368 --> 01:59:44.568
It is ready.

01:59:56.935 --> 01:59:58.102
Look.

01:59:59.302 --> 02:00:00.668
God bless.

02:00:57.902 --> 02:00:59.902
<i>I told you I would give you a son.</i>

02:01:02.468 --> 02:01:04.435
<i>I am carrying your child.</i>

02:01:05.535 --> 02:01:07.402
<i>I shall give birth to a warrior</i>
 <i>for our people...</i>

02:01:07.668 --> 02:01:09.868
<i>...and a son of a Bey to Kayi tribe.</i>

02:01:11.668 --> 02:01:13.835
You tear my heart out, Selcan.

02:01:15.535 --> 02:01:17.302
You tear my heart out.

02:01:50.835 --> 02:01:54.035
This letter is for the
Principality of Antioch...

02:01:54.502 --> 02:01:55.802
...and this one is for Cyprus.

02:01:55.968 --> 02:01:57.502
Yes, my Lord.

02:01:58.102 --> 02:01:59.868
Have a safe journey.

02:02:28.502 --> 02:02:30.402
The chest of Ibn Arabi...

02:02:31.335 --> 02:02:33.002
...I do not even care about it.

02:02:33.635 --> 02:02:37.002
The Cardinal told me the latest
notices about the chest.

02:02:38.402 --> 02:02:39.802
We are not rivals anymore.

02:02:42.335 --> 02:02:45.402
You being a disciple of Arabi...

02:02:45.668 --> 02:02:48.935
... shall open many doors for our battle
with Islamic world.

02:02:49.935 --> 02:02:51.102
Congratulations.

02:03:24.402 --> 02:03:28.402
It must be here according to the map
Isadora drew.

02:03:28.535 --> 02:03:29.735
She says above the water.

02:03:33.502 --> 02:03:35.668
She drew what she heard from her father.

02:03:36.102 --> 02:03:38.635
If it is correct, this place is somewhere
under the bridge.

02:03:39.835 --> 02:03:41.835
Do you mean that this may not be
the place?

02:03:44.002 --> 02:03:48.835
All of Ertugrul Bey's plans can fall
through then.

02:04:57.035 --> 02:05:01.568
In such a place full of heathens
there must be something deceitful.

02:05:02.468 --> 02:05:03.635
You are right.

02:08:03.468 --> 02:08:04.635
Here it is.

02:09:24.835 --> 02:09:26.668
Dogan I have something to utter, brother.

02:09:27.435 --> 02:09:28.468
Say it, brother.

02:09:29.402 --> 02:09:31.802
Are not we three Alps?

02:09:32.502 --> 02:09:33.668
Yes, brother.

02:09:35.068 --> 02:09:37.002
We all have certain skills.

02:09:38.368 --> 02:09:39.368
Yes.

02:09:39.435 --> 02:09:42.535
Turgut brother is like a lion.

02:09:43.035 --> 02:09:44.302
Much thanks.

02:09:44.435 --> 02:09:47.802
I am a master swordsman.

02:09:48.702 --> 02:09:54.435
Take no offence but what is your skill?

02:10:00.068 --> 02:10:03.435
God give me patience. Look at Bamsi.

02:10:03.535 --> 02:10:05.302
He became a cat and trying to eat us.

02:10:05.368 --> 02:10:07.835
Stop it, do not grumble again.

02:10:08.435 --> 02:10:10.902
I swear, I shall go back
to the dungeon of The Templar's.

02:10:11.035 --> 02:10:13.935
Stop, brother. We found you so hard.

02:10:14.635 --> 02:10:16.102
Do not listen to him.

02:10:16.668 --> 02:10:19.402
He cannot face the truth
that he is unskilled.

02:10:25.035 --> 02:10:26.868
Here you are, brother. Your hat is here.

02:10:26.968 --> 02:10:27.968
Much thanks.

02:10:28.635 --> 02:10:34.968
Aykiz should pray day and night
that she marries a warrior like you.

02:10:35.968 --> 02:10:37.968
You have become very handsome, brother.

02:10:38.568 --> 02:10:39.868
Much thanks.

02:10:40.502 --> 02:10:41.802
My brothers.

02:11:33.835 --> 02:11:35.935
Is it dangerous to open the tunnels then?

02:11:37.002 --> 02:11:42.935
We can open them but I am worried
about the traps inside, Gundogdu Bey.

02:11:44.668 --> 02:11:47.435
If we do not strengthen
the sections we dig...

02:11:47.702 --> 02:11:50.702
...whole tunnel may collapse upon us.

02:11:51.702 --> 02:11:53.635
This can take months, my Bey.

02:11:55.401 --> 02:11:58.668
Can we endure a siege lasting for months,
Ertugrul?

02:11:59.735 --> 02:12:02.602
If any help does not come from outside,
we can my Bey.

02:12:03.768 --> 02:12:05.102
Are the Alps ready?

02:12:05.835 --> 02:12:07.335
Yes they are, brother.

02:12:08.702 --> 02:12:09.901
With God's help.

02:12:10.368 --> 02:12:14.502
We shall march after Turgut Alp's wedding
then.

02:12:17.435 --> 02:12:20.868
You go and say goodbye to Aykiz,
Wild Demir.

02:12:21.768 --> 02:12:23.935
Try not to cry too much.

02:12:25.068 --> 02:12:28.868
We did not have peace in our tribe
for a long time, my Bey.

02:12:29.602 --> 02:12:32.468
Thank God, there is now, thanks to you.

02:13:16.702 --> 02:13:21.502
I wish your mother was alive
to see these days.

02:13:27.702 --> 02:13:29.568
My dear father.

02:13:32.102 --> 02:13:34.502
I would give my life for you.

02:13:35.535 --> 02:13:37.002
May you live long.

02:13:40.102 --> 02:13:42.068
You raised me without a mother.

02:13:44.568 --> 02:13:46.702
Give me your blessing.

02:13:53.602 --> 02:13:55.302
I give you my blessing.

02:14:02.035 --> 02:14:03.468
Listen to me, my daughter.

02:14:05.402 --> 02:14:11.002
I have never fed you ill-gotten food.

02:14:12.835 --> 02:14:15.435
You do not feed your children too.

02:14:16.902 --> 02:14:18.602
Be faithful to your husband.

02:14:19.635 --> 02:14:21.802
Do not utter ill words to him.

02:14:22.702 --> 02:14:28.502
Do not make him repeat his words,
always be by his side.

02:14:33.302 --> 02:14:34.935
Permission?

02:14:36.302 --> 02:14:40.802
Yes, my son. Come in.

02:15:02.402 --> 02:15:03.735
Listen to me, son.

02:15:04.035 --> 02:15:07.568
I have always deemed you as my son.

02:15:09.102 --> 02:15:11.068
Do not sadden my daughter.

02:15:13.968 --> 02:15:18.102
Do not show her your manliness
by brute force.

02:15:19.735 --> 02:15:25.402
She is entrusted to you first
by the Creator then by me.

02:15:26.968 --> 02:15:29.002
Do not hurt what is entrusted.

02:15:32.635 --> 02:15:39.635
I shall not hurt what you entrusted me
as long as I breathe, father.

02:15:46.902 --> 02:15:48.402
It is an Alp's vow.

02:16:00.068 --> 02:16:06.335
The day is ours, come on then.

02:16:38.368 --> 02:16:40.302
Everyone shall open their hands...

02:16:40.568 --> 02:16:42.068
...and not tie them...

02:16:44.368 --> 02:16:46.502
...and utter as I do.

02:16:47.768 --> 02:16:49.402
For all our sins...

02:16:50.035 --> 02:16:51.768
<i>...we swear not to repeat them.</i>

02:16:51.835 --> 02:16:53.602
<i>We swear not to repeat them.</i>

02:16:53.668 --> 02:16:55.768
<i>-We swear.</i>
 <i>-We swear.</i>

02:16:55.835 --> 02:16:58.402
<i>-We swear.</i>
 <i>-We swear.</i>

02:16:59.368 --> 02:17:02.402
<i>For He is the Greatest.</i>

02:17:02.902 --> 02:17:04.602
<i>For there is...</i>

02:17:05.068 --> 02:17:06.868
<i>...no deity but Him.</i>

02:17:07.835 --> 02:17:11.468
<i>He is the owner of everything.</i>

02:17:11.535 --> 02:17:12.835
We ask His forgiveness.

02:17:13.468 --> 02:17:16.368
<i>We believe in God and in His angels...</i>

02:17:16.602 --> 02:17:19.668
<i>...and in His books and in His Prophets...</i>

02:17:19.935 --> 02:17:25.602
<i>...and in the day of reckoning</i>
 <i>and in destiny.</i>

02:17:25.968 --> 02:17:28.402
<i>We believe that goodness and malice</i>
 <i>are all His creations.</i>

02:17:29.068 --> 02:17:32.902
<i>There is no deity but God and Muhammad</i>
 <i>is his Prophet and subject.</i>

02:17:33.435 --> 02:17:34.668
Amen.

02:17:41.768 --> 02:17:44.502
You, Aykiz, daughter of Dukak's son Demir.

02:17:45.302 --> 02:17:47.968
Do you accept your marriage with Turgut,
son of Konur Alp...

02:17:48.035 --> 02:17:55.035
...with 10 dirhams of gold and
20 sheep...

02:17:55.702 --> 02:17:57.568
...as alimony?

02:18:01.802 --> 02:18:02.835
I do.

02:18:03.435 --> 02:18:04.435
Do you?

02:18:04.702 --> 02:18:05.868
I do.

02:18:06.002 --> 02:18:07.002
Do you?

02:18:07.702 --> 02:18:08.935
I do.

02:18:09.935 --> 02:18:11.702
You, Turgut, son of Konur Alp.

02:18:12.835 --> 02:18:17.535
Do you accept your marriage with Aykiz,
daughter of Demir...

02:18:18.102 --> 02:18:20.102
...with the alimony you pledged?

02:18:20.402 --> 02:18:21.535
I do.

02:18:21.835 --> 02:18:23.302
Do you?

02:18:23.368 --> 02:18:24.402
I do.

02:18:24.468 --> 02:18:25.502
Do you?

02:18:25.735 --> 02:18:27.302
I do.

02:18:30.502 --> 02:18:33.635
Witnesses, do you witness this marriage?

02:18:33.868 --> 02:18:35.068
We do.

02:18:41.635 --> 02:18:44.035
May God bless your marriage.

02:18:44.435 --> 02:18:45.768
Amen.

02:18:48.935 --> 02:18:55.502
My God, we do witness this marriage
of these two children of ours.

02:18:55.635 --> 02:19:00.802
You be a witness too.
My God, bless this marriage.

02:19:01.468 --> 02:19:07.568
Let this couple be nice to each other,
and have persistence in their marriage.

02:19:07.635 --> 02:19:08.668
Amen.

02:19:08.735 --> 02:19:14.035
Do not give them hatred, dissension
and separation.

02:19:14.102 --> 02:19:15.502
Amen.

02:19:15.868 --> 02:19:21.735
My God, give this couple
the peace and fondness...

02:19:22.535 --> 02:19:28.068
...that existed between Adam and Eve,
Muhammad...

02:19:29.368 --> 02:19:33.902
...peace be upon him and
Khadija and Ali...

02:19:34.568 --> 02:19:41.535
...may God be pleased from him and Fatima.

02:19:42.335 --> 02:19:43.568
-Amen.
-My God...

02:19:43.668 --> 02:19:49.102
...give this couple benign children,
long lifetime and plenty of sustenance.

02:19:49.535 --> 02:19:52.668
-Amen.
-My God...

02:19:53.868 --> 02:19:57.935
...make our wives and children
as lights for our eyes.

02:19:58.568 --> 02:20:02.468
Make us pioneers for those
who are afraid to revolt God.

02:20:02.568 --> 02:20:03.902
Amen.

02:20:04.035 --> 02:20:09.435
My God, give us goodness, kindness
and blessings in this world too.

02:20:09.602 --> 02:20:10.635
Amen.

02:20:10.702 --> 02:20:13.802
Give us goodness, kindness
and blessings in the afterlife too.

02:20:13.868 --> 02:20:16.468
-Spare us from the torment of fire.
-Amen.

02:20:18.035 --> 02:20:23.302
Your God is the one with might and honor
and is distant from their accusations...

02:20:23.735 --> 02:20:26.535
...and is supreme.

02:20:27.335 --> 02:20:30.735
Greetings to the prophets.

02:20:31.102 --> 02:20:32.468
-Amen.
-Glory belongs...

02:20:32.602 --> 02:20:35.568
...only to God the deity of worlds.

02:20:37.402 --> 02:20:41.835
<i>My God who is supreme</i>
 <i>and who is distant from accusations.</i>

02:20:42.102 --> 02:20:43.968
<i>Greetings to all prophets.</i>

02:20:44.302 --> 02:20:46.702
<i>Glory belongs only to Him.</i>

02:20:47.635 --> 02:20:48.935
<i>Al Fatihah.</i>

02:20:57.835 --> 02:20:59.335
Amen.

02:21:40.368 --> 02:21:45.402
May God grant you a long and happy life
with your children.

02:21:46.435 --> 02:21:50.968
May God grant you eternal happiness
and bless your family.

02:22:10.802 --> 02:22:13.868
May God make you happy and give
you a long lasting marriage.

02:22:14.402 --> 02:22:16.402
Much Thanks, my Bey.

02:22:18.902 --> 02:22:20.502
I hope the same for you.

02:22:25.768 --> 02:22:27.035
Thank you Bey.

02:22:29.835 --> 02:22:31.035
Be happy.

02:22:31.502 --> 02:22:33.435
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

02:22:34.035 --> 02:22:37.868
May God consummate your engagement
with Halime Sultan.

02:22:38.835 --> 02:22:40.002
Amen.

02:23:29.835 --> 02:23:33.335
What has Turgut Alp done?

02:23:33.502 --> 02:23:38.635
He put up a tent in the sky.

02:23:41.035 --> 02:23:45.035
What has he done to make
the woman he loved happy?

02:23:45.535 --> 02:23:50.402
He made a stallion from a horse
raised a camel and a ram.

02:23:51.335 --> 02:23:53.668
Have they broken any hearts?

02:23:54.302 --> 02:23:57.402
Have they utter ill words?

02:23:57.735 --> 02:24:00.902
Neither they broke hearts
nor they uttered ill words.

02:24:01.302 --> 02:24:06.835
They wed each other
and reached happiness.

02:24:07.402 --> 02:24:11.768
May God make them happy then.

02:24:11.835 --> 02:24:13.402
Amen.

02:24:13.468 --> 02:24:15.068
Be in ever happiness.

02:24:15.402 --> 02:24:17.802
May God grant you a long marriage.

02:24:18.702 --> 02:24:21.602
What has Turgut Alp done?

02:24:22.302 --> 02:24:25.835
He put up a tent in the sky.

02:24:26.368 --> 02:24:30.068
What has he done to make
the woman he loved, happy?

02:24:30.468 --> 02:24:35.368
He made a stallion from a horse
raised a camel and a ram.

02:24:58.002 --> 02:25:01.468
Come on!

02:25:13.935 --> 02:25:19.302
I prayed much to kill you
if you had lost your path...

02:25:21.068 --> 02:25:23.702
...and became the tribe's enemy.

02:25:26.702 --> 02:25:30.502
I also prayed much to die in your hands,
Aykiz.

02:25:34.802 --> 02:25:36.535
They are all in the past now.

02:25:38.035 --> 02:25:44.002
May God not let me live a single day
without your love.

02:25:46.002 --> 02:25:48.468
This is what I know and say.

02:25:50.902 --> 02:25:53.502
May God never separate us
my brave man.

02:26:19.035 --> 02:26:23.635
When we take Yigit Alp back,
we should make a big wedding too.

02:26:24.935 --> 02:26:26.702
If God permits, Ertugrul Bey.

02:26:35.635 --> 02:26:37.835
I shall gather all people tomorrow.

02:26:38.768 --> 02:26:40.968
Just like the old days.

02:26:42.668 --> 02:26:43.835
I hope it is well, Bey.

02:26:44.435 --> 02:26:47.335
I missed fighting, Hayme, fighting.

02:26:48.002 --> 02:26:49.968
It is time for resurrection now.

02:26:50.735 --> 02:26:54.602
We shall resurrect so that Turkish nation
shall wake up.

02:27:00.702 --> 02:27:03.035
Turn your back, I shall apply
your ointment.

02:27:03.335 --> 02:27:05.835
Even the boil does not hurt me anymore,
Hayme.

02:27:06.568 --> 02:27:08.868
You shall overcome it too, my Bey.

02:27:56.768 --> 02:28:03.502
Long live Suleyman Shah!

02:28:03.802 --> 02:28:07.568
Long live Suleyman Shah!

02:28:13.535 --> 02:28:14.868
My Alps...

02:28:17.368 --> 02:28:18.735
...my Beys.

02:28:20.568 --> 02:28:22.535
My sword brothers.

02:28:23.402 --> 02:28:28.768
My ghazis who are impatient to
become martyrs.

02:28:30.868 --> 02:28:34.102
I summoned you in order to take
the life of the enemy...

02:28:34.902 --> 02:28:40.068
...who wants to take away
our unity and peace...

02:28:40.968 --> 02:28:45.102
...by using all kinds of
instigation and trickery.

02:28:46.302 --> 02:28:51.902
We shall bring that big walled castle down
in which they hide from our anger.

02:28:54.568 --> 02:28:58.535
We shall rumble the earth and sky
with the sound of our Alps...

02:28:59.035 --> 02:29:00.768
...who shall enter blue and exit red.

02:29:00.835 --> 02:29:07.802
God is Great!

02:29:07.935 --> 02:29:12.635
God is Great!

02:29:13.935 --> 02:29:17.568
For such a long time,
they have tortured our tribe.

02:29:18.068 --> 02:29:20.735
They tried to kill our brave sons.

02:29:21.402 --> 02:29:23.935
Now, it is time to pay the price.

02:29:24.468 --> 02:29:29.035
You know the best how dirty, rotten
and rancid the Templars are...

02:29:29.868 --> 02:29:34.968
...who spread fear...

02:29:35.568 --> 02:29:37.568
...all over the World.

02:29:39.335 --> 02:29:44.068
We shall bring that castle down
with our noble blood...

02:29:44.635 --> 02:29:46.502
...and faith you possess.

02:29:46.702 --> 02:29:52.368
God is Great!

02:29:52.568 --> 02:29:55.102
God is Great!

02:29:56.768 --> 02:29:58.568
Do you pledge to fight by my side?

02:29:58.635 --> 02:30:00.068
We do!

02:30:01.502 --> 02:30:04.335
Do you pledge to become martyrs
by my side?

02:30:04.402 --> 02:30:05.735
We do!

02:30:05.968 --> 02:30:07.068
God is Great!

02:30:07.302 --> 02:30:13.035
God is Great!

02:30:13.102 --> 02:30:19.668
God is Great!

02:30:19.735 --> 02:30:26.568
God is Great!

02:30:26.768 --> 02:30:30.335
God is Great!

02:30:30.402 --> 02:30:34.402
May God bless you and be in our aid.

02:30:34.602 --> 02:30:36.302
Amen!
