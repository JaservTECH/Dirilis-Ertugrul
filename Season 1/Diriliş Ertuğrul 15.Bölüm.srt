Episode 15 will start after 12:10 min

12:10.850 --> 12:13.850
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:16.252 --> 12:19.252
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:20.361 --> 12:23.361
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.829
We caught him, my Lord.

13:51.895 --> 13:54.129
Our men are bringing him here.

14:27.728 --> 14:29.962
We will see who is right, soon.

14:32.962 --> 14:37.729
That man fooled you and my stupid sister
and stole your hearts.

14:40.695 --> 14:43.862
The man even fooled my nanny.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.395
But this is it, Halime Sultan.

14:50.095 --> 14:52.029
What do you mean?

14:54.062 --> 14:55.995
We caught Ertugrul.

14:57.629 --> 14:58.895
He will be here soon.

14:58.962 --> 15:00.695
What?

15:33.729 --> 15:35.895
No!

15:49.862 --> 15:52.062
Do not do this, I am begging you.

15:52.829 --> 15:57.495
You will hurt not only him,
but also yourself and your country.

15:57.762 --> 16:00.995
Do you know how
many of my soldiers he killed?

16:03.362 --> 16:06.329
How many dervishes
in my sheikh's convent.

16:06.495 --> 16:08.862
He ruined my reputation.

16:09.729 --> 16:11.762
He deserves to die for sure.

16:11.829 --> 16:14.529
No! Ertugrul would not do that!

16:16.829 --> 16:19.629
But the pain you gave me...

16:22.662 --> 16:25.495
...was the hardest, Halime sultan.

16:36.862 --> 16:41.395
You will live in the hunting lodge
as my cursed wife for life.

16:43.695 --> 16:49.595
Each day you live,
you will pay for your sins.

17:32.062 --> 17:33.562
Ertugrul!

17:33.729 --> 17:34.929
Ertugrul!

17:34.995 --> 17:36.395
Ertugrul!

17:36.462 --> 17:37.862
Halime.

17:39.329 --> 17:40.762
Ertugrul!

17:40.862 --> 17:42.395
No!

17:42.495 --> 17:44.129
Halime!

17:49.695 --> 17:51.495
Stop!

18:21.495 --> 18:23.662
So, this is it.

18:33.795 --> 18:36.962
Kayi Tent

19:13.562 --> 19:15.029
My green-eyed baby.

19:17.529 --> 19:20.629
It is no use to be sorry
if it is not meant to be.

19:20.695 --> 19:22.695
Pull yourself together.

19:25.729 --> 19:28.662
We have been longing for a baby
for so long.

19:28.762 --> 19:32.362
And we lost it
the very moment we thought we had it.

19:32.429 --> 19:35.362
The fire within me does not go away.

19:35.429 --> 19:38.462
I could not be a woman
and give you a child.

19:38.529 --> 19:39.862
Nonsense.

19:40.595 --> 19:42.795
What are you saying, woman?

19:42.862 --> 19:44.395
Do not say this again.

19:44.462 --> 19:46.929
It is God who both grants and takes it.

19:48.129 --> 19:50.495
Do not think about this anymore.

19:50.562 --> 19:55.129
See, it is Nowruz again.
It is so sparkly around.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.462
We will have lots of things to do.

19:59.795 --> 20:03.462
You are a bey's woman.
You cannot be depressed.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.862
I surrendered to God.

20:08.029 --> 20:11.429
I hope God Almighty
gives another child to us.

20:11.895 --> 20:13.962
Do not be saddened, alright?

20:14.462 --> 20:17.362
Selcan, who am I talking to?
Come on, stand up.

20:17.429 --> 20:18.862
Come on.

20:18.929 --> 20:22.562
You will go back to work
and start working again.

20:22.662 --> 20:25.629
You will show your face to everybody.
Alright?

20:27.729 --> 20:29.695
That is it.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.629
I go to the pavilion,
and you go back to work.

20:32.695 --> 20:34.395
Gundogdu...

20:34.462 --> 20:37.629
You are a brave man.
Be careful.

20:38.529 --> 20:41.329
There are jackals everywhere in the tent.

21:21.995 --> 21:24.895
How dare you talk to my father
like that, Uncle?

21:25.029 --> 21:31.062
Did the man who backed you up
against all accusations deserve this?

21:31.462 --> 21:33.962
-Listen...
-He is your blood brother.

21:34.062 --> 21:36.395
How many times you fought together.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.829
That great man
who saved my life so many times.

21:40.462 --> 21:44.629
If you did not bring Nasir, and we were
stuck with Gulhan's soldiers...

21:44.695 --> 21:46.629
...what would we have done?

21:46.695 --> 21:48.895
All of us would have been destroyed.

21:48.962 --> 21:53.762
The only reason for this is your father's
and Ertugrul's stubbornness.

21:53.829 --> 21:59.862
We started to have troubles all the time
since Ertugrul went after that girl.

22:00.962 --> 22:03.762
This is not a selfish fight, son.

22:03.829 --> 22:05.895
Kayis' future is on the line.

22:05.962 --> 22:08.529
How much longer is this going to last?

22:08.629 --> 22:14.729
How many more lives will be lost before
Ertugrul takes the Shahzade's daughter?

22:15.729 --> 22:17.795
Your father is following Ertugrul.

22:17.862 --> 22:19.895
He was going to get him married
with Gokce.

22:19.962 --> 22:22.729
But he does not say
anything anymore. Why?

22:22.795 --> 22:24.962
And what about the death of the baby?

22:25.062 --> 22:27.462
Was that fate, as well?

22:27.529 --> 22:31.695
Or is somebody planning something
to allow Ertugrul to be a Bey?

22:33.062 --> 22:35.462
What are you talking about, Uncle?

22:36.895 --> 22:39.062
You have been waiting
for that baby for years.

22:39.129 --> 22:41.462
And what happened?

22:41.529 --> 22:44.829
Ertugrul's closest ones killed your baby.

22:44.895 --> 22:48.062
If Ertugrul
takes the Shahzade's daughter...

22:48.129 --> 22:51.662
...he will be relatives
with Sultan Alaaddin.

22:51.729 --> 22:56.362
And if he convinces El Aziz
and show that he is right...

22:56.995 --> 23:02.629
...he will be so powerful that not only
Kayis, but also Oghuz' will tail him.

23:04.362 --> 23:07.329
But I don't know to which hell
this will drag him into.

23:07.395 --> 23:09.062
As to your father...

23:09.129 --> 23:12.062
I would do anything for the tent's future.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.662
Kayis' future is so priceless that...

23:14.762 --> 23:20.362
...it may not be left to your father's
fondness towards Ertugrul.

23:21.529 --> 23:24.395
And this price's burden
is on your shoulders.

23:43.729 --> 23:45.329
Move over.

24:08.362 --> 24:09.995
I want the truth.

24:10.862 --> 24:12.862
Only the truth, Ertugrul.

24:13.695 --> 24:17.395
To whom and what are you serving for?

24:24.595 --> 24:28.395
We would never serve to anyone
accept God, Hazrat Ameer.

24:30.029 --> 24:31.695
As for the truth...

24:33.562 --> 24:38.429
The most saddening
and pathetic truth...

24:38.495 --> 24:41.029
...I have ever seen in my life is you.

24:46.629 --> 24:52.462
You either sent to the dungeon
or exiled everybody around you.

24:54.329 --> 24:55.795
Or killed.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.529
May God Correct you, El Aziz.

25:02.062 --> 25:05.695
Ertugrul must die, immediately.
If anything goes wrong...

25:05.795 --> 25:08.662
Titus told us to kill all of them
if anything goes wrong.

25:08.729 --> 25:09.829
What about El Aziz?

25:09.895 --> 25:11.095
Him too, if necessary.

25:11.329 --> 25:14.495
We are 8 people.
Share 11 people among yourselves.

25:14.562 --> 25:17.495
If anything goes wrong, kill them all.

25:17.829 --> 25:19.595
Yes, sir.

25:21.862 --> 25:25.395
You may not die here and now, Ertugrul.

25:25.962 --> 25:30.929
If you tell me and Halime Sultan how
you have been serving to the Templars...

25:32.062 --> 25:33.829
...I will let you live.

25:34.895 --> 25:38.795
And you will take your tent
and get out of my land.

25:40.095 --> 25:44.595
There is only one thing
I want from you.

25:45.995 --> 25:47.995
The truth.

25:50.662 --> 25:55.762
The thing you want as the truth,
is only words full of lies.

25:59.429 --> 26:02.629
If I give you those words full of lies...

26:02.695 --> 26:04.995
...I can save both myself and my tent.

26:06.362 --> 26:07.795
However...

26:07.862 --> 26:10.962
...you are in so much dirt that...

26:11.895 --> 26:15.429
...you are endangering
the whole Islamic world.

26:19.429 --> 26:21.929
May God forbid me
from such a weakness.

26:34.562 --> 26:36.595
If I die...

26:37.895 --> 26:39.562
...I die for God.

26:40.095 --> 26:43.062
And I do not get scared of this
even a little bit.

26:43.329 --> 26:44.662
Shame on you!

26:45.762 --> 26:49.962
Think of that poor girl,
if you do not think of yourself.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.962
Look at the place she is at
just because of you.

26:57.029 --> 27:01.762
She will rot in my dungeons
while she was going to be an Eyyubi queen.

27:04.895 --> 27:07.729
What kind of a low-down man are you?

27:12.095 --> 27:14.995
What kind of a low-down man are you?

27:41.562 --> 27:43.995
You will die here today, Ertugrul.

27:45.495 --> 27:48.729
But your dirty blood
will not be on my hands.

27:50.629 --> 27:52.429
Set up a scaffold.

27:52.495 --> 27:53.795
He will be hanged.

27:53.862 --> 27:55.429
Yes, sir.

28:00.495 --> 28:01.762
God, help us.

28:04.329 --> 28:06.562
Do not let them kill him.

28:11.462 --> 28:15.495
The revolt that Nasir has started
in the Selahaddin Caravansary...

28:15.562 --> 28:18.662
...stopped as soon as it started,
Hazrat Ameer.

28:22.495 --> 28:24.595
How do you know that?

28:24.662 --> 28:26.329
I have Nasir.

28:27.062 --> 28:28.829
I took him to the tent.

28:34.929 --> 28:39.062
I knew you did not have the courage to say
what you told me to your commanders.

28:39.329 --> 28:41.562
You are a liar, Ertugrul.

28:42.729 --> 28:44.862
Do not call my Bey a liar!
You, fruitless.

28:44.929 --> 28:47.329
We know what you are, Nasir.

28:47.395 --> 28:50.095
The armies will not attack us
since we have you.

28:50.329 --> 28:53.495
Your Templar patrons
will not let you live anyway.

28:53.562 --> 28:56.029
Just like they did not let Eftelya live.

28:56.129 --> 29:00.495
All the Ameer's of Eyyubis
will unite and destroy your tent.

29:01.629 --> 29:06.029
They will not let any of you live.
And you not, either, Sahabettin.

29:06.095 --> 29:07.895
You disgraced Islam.

29:07.962 --> 29:11.429
Do not dare talking about Islam,
you degenerate pig!

29:11.529 --> 29:12.829
Take this pig.

29:18.762 --> 29:22.862
I have one of your
two valuable commanders...

29:22.962 --> 29:25.562
...and the other is together with us.

29:26.595 --> 29:28.129
You are lying.

29:29.562 --> 29:31.662
Come and visit us, then.

29:31.729 --> 29:36.529
We will cook one of our meals for you,
and you will see it for yourself.

29:54.462 --> 29:58.529
If Gundogdu did not bring Nasir,
our tent would be finished.

29:58.595 --> 30:00.829
The army of El Aziz is under our nose.

30:00.895 --> 30:04.529
They stopped for now,
but they can attack any moment.

30:04.595 --> 30:07.895
And you will be responsible for that,
Suleyman Shah.

30:08.895 --> 30:11.395
Not your Ertugrul.

30:11.662 --> 30:14.529
What should I have done, Kurdoglu?

30:14.595 --> 30:18.662
Throw my son in front of them
and watch them tear him to pieces?

30:18.762 --> 30:22.729
Or give my son's blood
to the Crusaders' conspiracy?

30:22.829 --> 30:25.929
It is you who is the Bey. It is up to you.

30:27.062 --> 30:29.595
I will get your soldiers ready for war.

30:29.662 --> 30:32.629
All of them are
waiting for your order to die.

30:32.929 --> 30:34.862
We will not fight in the tent.

30:34.929 --> 30:38.495
We will attack our enemies
outside the tent.

30:38.595 --> 30:43.562
2.000 soldiers will attack an army
who is four times bigger than them.

30:44.929 --> 30:50.529
But neither their mothers, nor their wives
will know how this will end.

30:51.795 --> 30:55.895
Let us say we captured their commanders
and stopped the war.

30:55.995 --> 30:57.329
And then?

30:58.995 --> 31:01.429
Who knows what El Aziz will do?

31:03.329 --> 31:05.429
We cannot wait anymore.

31:05.495 --> 31:07.562
Our flock dropped like flies.

31:08.462 --> 31:12.429
The way things are,
we will be starving in no time.

31:13.029 --> 31:15.895
And you are the one
who is responsible for all this!

31:15.962 --> 31:17.595
That is enough, Kurdoglu!

31:17.662 --> 31:19.595
You are crossing the line!

31:19.662 --> 31:21.129
Is that so?

31:21.395 --> 31:23.429
I am with you since my childhood.

31:23.495 --> 31:26.962
Have I ever said a bad word to you?

31:28.029 --> 31:30.595
I never talked behind your back.

31:30.695 --> 31:32.995
Have I ever undermined you?

31:33.129 --> 31:34.129
No.

31:34.395 --> 31:37.695
I always fought for you, for our tent.

31:37.762 --> 31:41.462
I gave my woman's,
my children's lives to Mongols.

31:42.429 --> 31:47.995
I am sick of Ertugrul's slanders
as if these haven't happened.

31:49.695 --> 31:53.995
Things are not alright in the tent.
We cannot make both ends meet.

31:54.495 --> 31:57.529
How many times
we have been stabbed from our back.

31:57.595 --> 32:00.662
Why? Because of your
stubborn son, Ertugrul!

32:00.729 --> 32:02.329
Enough!

32:04.095 --> 32:07.562
You should know that
this will not go on like this!

32:18.795 --> 32:21.329
My Lord...

32:21.429 --> 32:24.362
...we should not lose
Kurdoglu's support.

32:24.429 --> 32:29.595
He should not leave us in these hard times
because of Ertugrul's delusions.

32:29.862 --> 32:33.029
If we lose the support of the beys
who obey him...

32:33.129 --> 32:36.429
...this disunion will destroy our tent.

32:37.629 --> 32:40.362
Father...

32:41.929 --> 32:44.062
...we must have peace now.

32:47.362 --> 32:49.129
I am not angry at my brother.

32:49.362 --> 32:55.495
I am not, but it is your duty
to discipline him as his bey and father.

32:58.862 --> 33:02.595
You know,
he does not listen to me anymore.

33:07.362 --> 33:10.395
Ertugrul will come back with good news.

33:10.495 --> 33:12.129
I know that.

33:12.362 --> 33:14.062
What good news, father?

33:14.129 --> 33:16.929
Don't you see?
He went there to take Halime.

33:17.929 --> 33:20.362
What are you saying, Gundogdu?

33:20.762 --> 33:24.562
That Ertugrul is that weak?
Is this what you are saying?

33:24.629 --> 33:27.062
He is in love, father.
He is in love.

33:27.862 --> 33:30.962
He does not know what to do.

33:31.029 --> 33:33.929
We do not know what will happen.

33:33.995 --> 33:37.895
Do not get surprised if he forgets
the tent because of that girl.

33:37.962 --> 33:40.595
If he brings Halime to the tent...

33:40.662 --> 33:44.829
...El Aziz will also get angry at us.

33:45.829 --> 33:49.695
We will have the whole world as enemy
just because of a girl.

33:53.329 --> 33:54.929
Excuse me.

34:24.595 --> 34:25.962
Did you hear?

34:26.029 --> 34:27.795
I did.

34:31.562 --> 34:33.362
What are you saying?

34:33.462 --> 34:37.562
My Bey, that blood brother of yours...

34:37.662 --> 34:41.795
...is poisoning not only the tent,
but also your children.

34:45.862 --> 34:47.495
Like Selcan?

34:51.395 --> 34:54.795
Who knows when
she will get pregnant again.

34:55.629 --> 34:57.029
Maybe never.

35:03.595 --> 35:08.129
That is why
it is time to look for a new wife.

35:10.995 --> 35:16.362
My Bey, if anything happens
to you or your children...

35:17.462 --> 35:20.929
...our family does not have a heir.

35:23.129 --> 35:27.362
Seigniory  will slip through
Suleyman Shah's children's fingers.

35:31.395 --> 35:35.862
We have to get Ertugrul married
immediately.

35:38.895 --> 35:41.462
And Gundogdu must have a child.

36:32.129 --> 36:34.662
You still persist, don't you Halime?

36:35.629 --> 36:40.495
You still cannot accept
that he is a traitor, can you?

36:48.362 --> 36:49.429
Ertugrul!

36:49.495 --> 36:52.662
-Stop her!
-Do not do that, I am begging you!

36:52.729 --> 36:55.762
Do not do that!
You are making a very big mistake!

37:06.862 --> 37:08.495
Tell me the truth.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.129
Say that you have lied.

37:13.362 --> 37:16.895
I swear to God, you will not be
the only one I kill.

37:20.929 --> 37:25.762
I will let Halime Sultan rot in dungeans
that she have not even dreamt of.

37:26.629 --> 37:28.629
Tell me the truth.

37:30.362 --> 37:32.362
Wake up, Hazrat Ameer.

37:33.129 --> 37:34.662
Open your eyes.

37:36.362 --> 37:39.995
Imagine the disasters you will cause
in the Islamic world.

37:41.395 --> 37:44.429
Imagine the innocent blood
that will spill.

37:44.495 --> 37:45.995
Move over.

37:54.795 --> 37:56.995
I want to know the truth, Ertugrul.

38:00.129 --> 38:01.895
Tell me the truth.

38:10.029 --> 38:14.529
I loved you so deeply that
I cannot be slave to lies, Halime Sultan.

38:20.029 --> 38:22.329
Do not be sad that I will dye.

38:24.729 --> 38:28.462
I will die with the shadah of God
in my words...

38:29.729 --> 38:31.829
...and your love in my heart.

38:34.662 --> 38:40.362
The day you die is the day
I am burried with my shroud, Ertugrul Bey.

38:42.562 --> 38:44.962
I will pray everyday to come to you.

38:48.029 --> 38:51.529
You will be in my last breath,
even when I am dying.

39:19.062 --> 39:20.595
Untie him.

39:21.995 --> 39:23.595
But, my Lord...

39:24.462 --> 39:25.995
Do what I am saying.

39:31.329 --> 39:33.129
We are going to Kayi Tent.

40:35.929 --> 40:37.562
We are here, Bey!

40:44.395 --> 40:46.429
Watch out, you infidels!

41:56.095 --> 41:58.895
Did I not tell you not to follow me?

41:58.962 --> 42:01.862
Bey, we were just wandering around.

42:01.929 --> 42:02.995
We heard voices.

42:03.095 --> 42:05.329
And we saw that it was you.

42:23.629 --> 42:27.595
Why did you? Why did you do this?

42:32.995 --> 42:34.529
You will die.

42:35.429 --> 42:37.029
You, fool.

42:54.795 --> 42:56.662
God...

42:57.695 --> 42:59.329
What did I do?

43:03.462 --> 43:07.729
You saw it yourself that the Templars
are all around Aleppo.

43:10.095 --> 43:15.129
My closest guards. The soldiers
who have been protecting my life...

43:17.995 --> 43:19.829
Were all of them Templars?

43:19.895 --> 43:23.962
And their leader is Hisam,
who you knew as a merchant...

43:24.029 --> 43:26.629
...and gave all your money.

43:27.729 --> 43:29.662
And his commander Nazir.

43:31.729 --> 43:35.329
But we can still clean this mess,
Hazrat Ameer.

43:36.929 --> 43:38.695
What can I do, then?

43:40.495 --> 43:42.829
Our prophet has said
"Wait for the doomsday...

43:42.962 --> 43:48.329
...when you do not give responsibility
to the competent people.

43:48.395 --> 43:50.829
Leave it to the competent people.

43:51.929 --> 43:54.395
Your uncle Sahabettin Atabey...

43:54.462 --> 43:57.662
...is waiting good news from you
in our tent.

44:52.062 --> 44:56.695
You showed me that even death
cannot do lovers apart, Ertugrul.

44:57.329 --> 45:00.395
May God not leave me without you,
Halime Sultan.

45:50.829 --> 45:55.495
<i>Commander Gunhan,</i>
 <i>leave the command to Atabey Sahabettin...</i>

45:55.629 --> 45:58.595
<i>...and pull the army</i>
 <i>back to Aleppo immediately.</i>

45:58.662 --> 46:03.362
<i>Atabey will punish Commander Nasir</i>
 <i>in the harshest way.</i>

46:04.562 --> 46:08.062
<i>And pass my apologies to Suleyman Shah.</i>

47:15.429 --> 47:17.329
May God forgive his sins.

47:18.795 --> 47:22.995
We finished him
before he could commit a sin, Shahzade.

47:37.562 --> 47:40.629
Take this necklace to Sultan Alaaddin.

47:40.729 --> 47:44.029
For him to be sure he is dead...
and have a relief.

47:45.995 --> 47:50.695
What about Shahzade Yigitalp?
What are we going to do about him?

47:51.629 --> 47:54.462
He is at the palace for now.

47:54.562 --> 47:56.962
You must kill him, as well, Afsin.

48:18.062 --> 48:21.429
Aleppo

48:42.429 --> 48:44.595
Do you have any news from my father?

48:44.662 --> 48:48.062
No, Shahzade.
But I know somebody who has.

48:48.629 --> 48:50.762
I can take you to him.

48:50.829 --> 48:51.895
Who?

48:51.995 --> 48:53.429
Afsin Bey.

49:30.129 --> 49:34.862
AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS CASTLE

49:34.995 --> 49:38.762
We did everything we can, Cardinal.

49:39.562 --> 49:42.562
Our organization
is ready for the Crusades...

49:42.629 --> 49:46.329
...in the
Jerusalem-Aleppo-Tabriz triangle.

49:46.895 --> 49:50.395
Civil wars, plague, assassinations...

49:50.695 --> 49:52.529
...sect wars.

49:52.595 --> 49:56.595
As you would appreciate,
we went a long way in short time.

49:57.662 --> 50:00.862
So, what about Konya?

50:00.962 --> 50:03.095
There was a man named Kara Toygar.

50:03.362 --> 50:04.395
What happened to him?

50:04.462 --> 50:06.662
What was
the name of that Bey's son?

50:06.729 --> 50:10.095
It will be dealt with soon, Cardinal.

50:10.562 --> 50:15.629
Our preparations to set Turkmens
and Babais against each other...

50:15.929 --> 50:18.062
...are about to finish.

50:19.095 --> 50:23.829
Of course,
if Ertugrul does not get in your way.

50:25.629 --> 50:28.429
The Aleppo army
has surrounded Kayi Plain.

50:29.329 --> 50:31.862
The Kayis will not be a problem anymore.

50:31.962 --> 50:34.562
You have been telling me for months...

50:34.662 --> 50:37.995
...that you would bring me
Ibn al Arabi and his relic.

50:38.095 --> 50:42.395
I trusted you and
made the Pope a promise.

50:42.495 --> 50:44.395
But you failed me.

50:44.929 --> 50:47.129
We know he is in Jerusalem.

50:47.462 --> 50:49.662
We will catch him soon.

50:50.929 --> 50:57.929
How can I call the Crusader army
for duty if you do not keep your promise?

51:01.529 --> 51:04.095
This is your last chance.

51:04.895 --> 51:09.795
If you want Jesus' brave knights
to go to the holy lands...

51:10.362 --> 51:14.029
...I am sure you know
very well what to do.

51:40.395 --> 51:42.929
What is this relic, His Holiness?

51:45.829 --> 51:50.962
Eftelya, I want you to deal
with the Cardinal more closely.

51:51.695 --> 51:54.429
I must know every step he takes.

51:55.329 --> 51:59.629
It is certain that he has feelings
for you that he cannot suppress.

52:02.395 --> 52:05.529
This way, he will also
stay away from my niece.

52:07.462 --> 52:09.029
Yes, sir.

52:09.729 --> 52:11.862
Titus...

52:11.962 --> 52:14.129
Keep an eye on Claudius.

52:16.062 --> 52:19.129
These unabashed people
are making a fool of us.

53:18.846 --> 53:21.046
Knight, what is your name?

53:23.979 --> 53:25.713
Judas.

53:27.079 --> 53:28.613
Judas?

53:28.946 --> 53:30.413
Judas.

53:36.913 --> 53:39.079
What a pity, Turgut Alp.

53:56.713 --> 53:58.946
Godspeed, Claudius.

53:59.046 --> 54:03.646
Ibn al Arabi's blood and relic
will enlighten our way.

54:05.113 --> 54:07.446
I rely on you, son.

54:08.546 --> 54:10.946
I will not fail you, sir.

54:56.413 --> 54:59.446
Damn you, ominous Turk!

54:59.813 --> 55:01.213
Damn you!

55:01.846 --> 55:04.646
We should have killed Ertugrul
in the beginning.

55:04.713 --> 55:07.846
Unfortunately,
you turned out to be right, Titus.

55:08.579 --> 55:12.713
He collapsed our organization
in Aleppo just by himself.

55:13.146 --> 55:18.046
He destroyed everything
we have been working on for years.

55:18.513 --> 55:20.646
How can this be possible?

55:21.613 --> 55:24.079
Ibn al Arabi and Ertugrul.

55:25.213 --> 55:27.213
What do you mean, Titus?

55:27.546 --> 55:32.513
Things that I am leery of even thinking
are on the tip of my tongue, sir.

55:37.113 --> 55:38.613
Do it like this.

55:40.446 --> 55:44.213
If you do it like this, it puffs up.

55:45.846 --> 55:48.713
There is some mold on it.
It is still wet.

55:49.079 --> 55:50.879
Let us not use this.

56:01.446 --> 56:02.846
Air it thoroughly.

56:07.913 --> 56:09.813
Do it tighter.

56:09.879 --> 56:13.513
I see that you forgot your pain
so quickly, Selcan.

56:17.946 --> 56:20.913
It is not the kind of pain
to be forgotten quickly.

56:20.979 --> 56:23.179
Time does not pass in the tent.

56:23.479 --> 56:27.213
I came back to work
in order to make it through the evening.

56:29.846 --> 56:31.646
You are right.

56:31.713 --> 56:33.679
Your pain is very big.

56:35.013 --> 56:39.513
You cannot deal with the rugs
in this condition.

56:42.979 --> 56:46.413
Gokce will deal with them from now on.

56:53.413 --> 56:55.979
What are you saying, mother?

56:56.079 --> 56:59.079
Are you trying to upset me more...

56:59.946 --> 57:05.413
...or to punish me for the death of my
baby thinking I am responsible for it?

57:09.613 --> 57:13.513
Since when are you
questioning my decisions?

57:17.813 --> 57:19.513
Do not cross the line.

57:20.879 --> 57:25.213
From now on, you will not do any work.

57:26.546 --> 57:30.113
You will sit in your tent
and try to get pregnant again.

57:32.479 --> 57:34.779
You will take care of your health.

57:36.079 --> 57:40.846
It's high time for Gundogdu
to have a baby.

57:42.613 --> 57:44.646
We cannot be late any more.

57:45.513 --> 57:47.713
What if we do?

57:51.679 --> 57:53.979
The Bey needs a child.

57:54.046 --> 57:57.113
He needs a son,
so that his seigniory will go on.

57:58.779 --> 58:03.646
And a woman who will give him
a child befits the bey.

58:06.113 --> 58:07.813
Women!

58:09.979 --> 58:11.679
Look at me.

58:12.946 --> 58:18.579
From now on,
Gokce will take care of the rugs.

58:20.546 --> 58:22.946
You will do whatever she says.

58:24.013 --> 58:27.813
Her word is my word.

58:30.879 --> 58:32.413
The spring has come.

58:32.479 --> 58:35.979
The tent waits for new goods from us.

58:36.746 --> 58:40.013
We must prepare these goods
with heart and soul.

58:42.646 --> 58:44.613
Bismillah!

59:16.879 --> 59:18.079
Kurdoglu is here, sir.

59:18.146 --> 59:19.913
Bring him in now!

59:20.946 --> 59:26.546
Sir, he is our last chance
to destroy Kayis and Ertugrul.

59:30.113 --> 59:33.579
At least, he is not a fool like Nasir.

59:47.046 --> 59:48.646
Welcome, Kurdoglu.

59:50.213 --> 59:52.913
You already know Eftelya and Titus.

59:53.546 --> 59:55.579
Titus...

59:56.846 --> 59:58.213
Eftelya...

00:59:58.813 --> 01:00:01.413
I heard you have been burning furiously.

01:00:01.479 --> 01:00:03.979
I wanted everybody to know it that way.

01:00:05.613 --> 01:00:07.213
Welcome, Kurdoglu.

01:00:07.913 --> 01:00:10.413
I know why you came here.

01:00:11.713 --> 01:00:15.446
But things are more complicated
then you think.

01:00:15.546 --> 01:00:18.146
I do not want to think
anything worse than...

01:00:18.213 --> 01:00:21.113
...Ertugrul bringing Nasir
into the tent.

01:00:22.079 --> 01:00:26.113
Unfortunately...
Ertugrul got what he wanted.

01:00:29.179 --> 01:00:31.679
Are you saying you could not do it?

01:00:33.913 --> 01:00:35.413
Titus...

01:00:42.213 --> 01:00:46.079
There was Ertugrul,
the little boy of the bey, before.

01:00:47.613 --> 01:00:51.146
Whom I would punish
by laying him on my knees.

01:00:51.813 --> 01:00:55.979
But now, thanks to you,
he is the tent's and Aleppo's new hero.

01:00:58.113 --> 01:01:03.079
If you want to cooperate,
we need to re-think about the terms.

01:01:37.746 --> 01:01:39.179
Hello.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:40.746
Welcome, Bey.

01:01:40.813 --> 01:01:42.446
Welcome.

01:01:48.213 --> 01:01:49.813
How is my Aykiz doing?

01:01:49.913 --> 01:01:52.879
She is well, Bey.
She is already back up.

01:01:53.413 --> 01:01:56.713
The ayran is fresh,
would you like to have some?

01:02:11.113 --> 01:02:16.846
I am thinking of the things you had told
me about Kurdoglu some time ago.

01:02:17.046 --> 01:02:20.046
After that murderer has been stopped...

01:02:20.213 --> 01:02:23.846
...I promised myself
not to talk about it anymore.

01:02:24.613 --> 01:02:26.779
And I thought it was delusion.

01:02:27.746 --> 01:02:31.579
However, the things he said
in the pavilion...

01:02:34.779 --> 01:02:37.413
Sometimes I thought he was right.

01:02:37.513 --> 01:02:40.046
I have said I pushed him too much.

01:02:40.113 --> 01:02:43.879
But this time,
there is something different.

01:02:44.946 --> 01:02:47.813
I know, Bey. I know.

01:02:47.879 --> 01:02:51.679
Everybody knows about
his misbehavior towards you.

01:02:52.813 --> 01:02:59.813
Our people are upset
because of our migration in winter.

01:03:01.546 --> 01:03:07.513
And the relatives of our latest martyrs
are against you.

01:03:10.679 --> 01:03:14.646
Some of the great and the good
of our pavilion are against me, either.

01:03:14.713 --> 01:03:16.479
Not all of them, Bey.

01:03:16.546 --> 01:03:21.046
I know lots of them
who would give their lives for you.

01:03:21.813 --> 01:03:25.779
They all come by,
and we talk about these matters.

01:03:25.879 --> 01:03:28.946
They are sad about what is going on.

01:03:31.546 --> 01:03:35.679
All these things
remind me of someone, Bey.

01:03:35.746 --> 01:03:36.979
Who?

01:03:37.913 --> 01:03:39.579
Selcan's father.

01:03:40.513 --> 01:03:41.946
Alptekin.

01:03:42.746 --> 01:03:48.213
He used to play shady games in hard times,
and provoked the beys against you.

01:03:49.513 --> 01:03:53.579
Until we raided his pavilion
and took his head.

01:03:55.613 --> 01:03:58.679
He caused so much pain,
to our people and you.

01:04:00.079 --> 01:04:02.079
Listen, Bey...

01:04:11.746 --> 01:04:14.679
Your late father had given this to me.

01:04:16.579 --> 01:04:19.679
It is time for me to gird on it again.

01:04:19.779 --> 01:04:22.179
Not because I am afraid of the war.

01:04:23.779 --> 01:04:26.779
It is because betrayal is close.

01:04:27.979 --> 01:04:30.079
You are right, Wild Demir.

01:04:31.513 --> 01:04:34.179
Hopefully, nothing like this will happen.

01:04:34.813 --> 01:04:38.579
Wait until Ertugrul
comes back with good news...

01:04:38.646 --> 01:04:41.446
...until the pavilion finds peace...

01:04:41.546 --> 01:04:44.879
...until everybody is
full of the joy of Nowruz...

01:04:44.946 --> 01:04:47.979
...than these anxious thoughts
will go away.

01:04:50.813 --> 01:04:52.846
I hope so, Bey.

01:04:53.479 --> 01:04:54.879
I hope so.

01:05:00.046 --> 01:05:02.579
Of course, Kurdoglu...

01:05:02.646 --> 01:05:04.713
I understand you very well.

01:05:04.779 --> 01:05:07.179
2.000 warriors are impatient.

01:05:08.146 --> 01:05:12.479
The opportunity of booty
will make them stronger.

01:05:13.046 --> 01:05:16.579
We know each other's language
very well.

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:21.646
But I cannot convince anyone in the
pavilion to raid over Muslims.

01:05:23.046 --> 01:05:26.079
Raid over Christians, then.

01:05:27.413 --> 01:05:29.146
Is this a joke?

01:05:29.413 --> 01:05:36.179
We are giving you a golden opportunity
to go after the infidel Orthodox people.

01:05:37.713 --> 01:05:40.146
So, both of us will win.

01:05:40.779 --> 01:05:43.579
While I get war booty with my soldiers...

01:05:43.679 --> 01:05:47.746
...the Christians whom you call
infidels will seek help from you.

01:05:47.813 --> 01:05:50.146
They will fall into your mercy.

01:05:51.646 --> 01:05:54.879
Titus had told me you were clever...

01:05:54.946 --> 01:05:57.879
...but I was not expecting this much.

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:02.913
And what is your offer for us, Kurdoglu?

01:06:02.979 --> 01:06:07.413
My offer is to catch Oghuz Turks
from their weakest point...

01:06:08.579 --> 01:06:12.079
...to set brother against brother...

01:06:12.946 --> 01:06:17.113
...Ertugrul to Gundogdu,
Suleyman to his sons...

01:06:17.779 --> 01:06:21.946
...and last of all,
to be the bey of the tent...

01:06:22.146 --> 01:06:26.546
...and nail Ertugrul's head
to the door of this castle.

01:06:29.779 --> 01:06:34.046
We are a poor tent
with brave soldiers and a weak flock.

01:06:34.846 --> 01:06:36.979
This is all I can do.

01:06:37.579 --> 01:06:39.213
It is a deal, then.

01:06:40.446 --> 01:06:42.213
Do you have a plan?

01:06:42.446 --> 01:06:47.779
You can start with giving a good price
to our tired flock.

01:08:01.179 --> 01:08:03.979
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:05.713
I am a traveler.

01:08:05.779 --> 01:08:08.213
I heard that Hazrat Sheikh is here.

01:08:09.446 --> 01:08:11.579
I would like to see his holy face.

01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:13.079
Is there permission?

01:08:13.146 --> 01:08:15.413
This is a place for the heart.

01:08:15.479 --> 01:08:17.746
Our door is open to every heart.

01:08:18.113 --> 01:08:19.713
Go ahead.

01:08:29.613 --> 01:08:33.879
There was a man who wanted to
assassinate our Prophet.

01:08:35.813 --> 01:08:39.479
When he thought he caught him alone...

01:08:40.579 --> 01:08:44.779
...he asked audaciously:
"Who will protect you from me?"

01:08:45.746 --> 01:08:47.546
The Holy Prophet...

01:08:47.646 --> 01:08:48.746
Peace be upon him.

01:08:48.813 --> 01:08:52.479
Said "God" in submission to fate.

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:56.913
The man's sword fell down from his hand.

01:08:58.213 --> 01:09:01.879
Our Prophet said "God"
so strongly from the heart...

01:09:01.946 --> 01:09:04.513
...the earth and the skies shattered.

01:09:04.946 --> 01:09:11.779
That infidel was shocked
seeing the way he said "God".

01:09:13.413 --> 01:09:16.646
A heart which has tight connections
to its creator...

01:09:16.746 --> 01:09:22.113
...would know that in any dangerous
situation, help will come from God.

01:09:24.879 --> 01:09:28.079
And prays for this
in any dangerous situation.

01:09:29.913 --> 01:09:33.879
Our Prophet picked the man's sword up
from the ground...

01:09:33.979 --> 01:09:36.179
...and asked:

01:09:36.446 --> 01:09:39.413
"Now, who will protect you from me?"

01:09:41.179 --> 01:09:46.046
However, the Prophet of mercy forgave
the man who came there to kill him.

01:09:56.679 --> 01:10:02.446
Sometimes, the ones who set a trap
loose even though they seem to win.

01:10:04.679 --> 01:10:06.913
May God protect us
from the ones who set traps.

01:10:06.979 --> 01:10:09.046
Amen!

01:10:32.813 --> 01:10:34.179
My Dundar.

01:10:37.213 --> 01:10:40.713
Your brother Ertugrul
went after the enemy.

01:10:44.213 --> 01:10:46.646
Like your brother Sungurtekin.

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:53.013
But they will come back.

01:10:55.013 --> 01:10:56.979
They will both come back.

01:11:01.013 --> 01:11:03.679
They will wrestle with you again.

01:11:04.546 --> 01:11:06.513
You will shoot arrows.

01:11:13.413 --> 01:11:16.413
You have three brave brothers.

01:11:17.513 --> 01:11:19.413
Three brave lions.

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:25.446
And you will be the fourth.

01:11:28.546 --> 01:11:30.813
By God's will...

01:11:30.879 --> 01:11:33.013
...you will come back, as well, son.

01:11:42.979 --> 01:11:47.113
<i>My black eyes are full of sleep</i>

01:11:48.113 --> 01:11:49.713
<i>Open them up</i>

01:11:50.479 --> 01:11:53.113
<i>You are worn to the bone</i>

01:11:53.213 --> 01:11:55.046
<i>Gather them up</i>

01:11:57.746 --> 01:12:01.979
<i>The life that God granted you</i>
 <i>Is on the move</i>

01:12:02.446 --> 01:12:04.013
<i>Catch it up</i>

01:12:04.979 --> 01:12:10.179
<i>Let me know, son</i>
 <i>If you have life in your body</i>

01:12:11.746 --> 01:12:15.079
<i>May my life be a sacrifice for you</i>

01:12:19.613 --> 01:12:22.946
<i>Your water flowed down Mount Kazilik</i>

01:12:24.646 --> 01:12:28.046
<i>Now it does not flow, unlike before</i>

01:12:28.646 --> 01:12:31.679
<i>Your grass grows on Mount Kazilik</i>

01:12:33.079 --> 01:12:36.579
<i>May it not grow now, unlike before</i>

01:12:36.879 --> 01:12:40.213
<i>Your deers run on Mount Kazilik</i>

01:12:40.513 --> 01:12:44.513
<i>May them not run now, unlike before</i>

01:12:47.479 --> 01:12:49.813
<i>May them petrified</i>

01:12:52.679 --> 01:12:54.646
<i>How do I know, son</i>

01:12:55.846 --> 01:13:01.679
<i>Is it from a lion, or a tiger</i>
 <i>How do I know, son</i>

01:13:05.846 --> 01:13:08.879
<i>Where these accidents came from</i>

01:13:11.713 --> 01:13:17.079
<i>Let me know, son,</i>
 <i>If you have life in your body</i>

01:13:18.079 --> 01:13:22.679
<i>May my life, son</i>
 <i>Be a sacrifice for you</i>

01:13:24.946 --> 01:13:30.079
<i>Let me know, son</i>
 <i>Just a few words from you.</i>

01:14:15.046 --> 01:14:18.179
It is time
to put the cradle away, Gundogdu.

01:14:24.413 --> 01:14:28.613
Woman, God closes a door,
and then opens another.

01:14:29.713 --> 01:14:31.713
He will give us a baby.

01:14:31.879 --> 01:14:33.646
Yes, hopefully.

01:14:33.713 --> 01:14:36.679
However, the people who caused this...

01:14:36.746 --> 01:14:41.546
...should pay for what they have done
both in this world and in the other.

01:14:41.613 --> 01:14:45.079
It all began
when that ominous girl came to our tent.

01:14:45.179 --> 01:14:46.979
Halime Sultan.

01:14:55.113 --> 01:14:58.546
But I know. This is the problem.

01:14:58.913 --> 01:15:01.479
You are not Mother Hayme's own son.

01:15:02.446 --> 01:15:05.446
If you were,
these would have never happened.

01:15:05.946 --> 01:15:07.813
Selcan!

01:15:07.879 --> 01:15:10.946
What are you saying?
Mother Hayme raised me.

01:15:11.013 --> 01:15:14.146
I never saw even once
that she favored Ertugrul over me.

01:15:14.213 --> 01:15:16.413
She is a righteous woman.

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:17.946
Of course she is...

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:22.913
...but a husband's son
cannot be the same as an own child.

01:15:22.979 --> 01:15:29.113
Even a cat eats its other children
just to protect the one it loves most.

01:15:29.879 --> 01:15:35.113
Mother Hayme  worries about Ertugrul
taking the seigniory.

01:15:35.646 --> 01:15:37.413
Selcan!

01:15:40.779 --> 01:15:44.046
If her son gets married with the
daughter of the Seljuk Shahzade...

01:15:44.179 --> 01:15:47.179
...imagine what will happen next.

01:16:13.113 --> 01:16:15.879
I was wondering, Bey...

01:16:16.779 --> 01:16:18.579
I am listening...

01:16:20.213 --> 01:16:23.946
Who builds these caravansaries
and what for?

01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:27.013
Why do they spend all that gold?

01:16:27.079 --> 01:16:31.446
They just feed everybody who comes.
Do they not have any reasoning?

01:16:31.946 --> 01:16:34.479
Caravansaries are built
by the state in Seljuks.

01:16:34.546 --> 01:16:36.779
Just for the commerce to develop.

01:16:37.579 --> 01:16:41.746
They do not take any money
from the guests the first three days.

01:16:41.813 --> 01:16:45.613
Bey, if we have a state one day...

01:16:46.479 --> 01:16:48.946
...let us build caravansaries, too.

01:16:49.513 --> 01:16:53.879
Yes, you would go there frequently
and eat for three days each time.

01:16:54.179 --> 01:16:57.213
Go to sleep.
We will leave before the sunrise.

01:16:58.713 --> 01:17:03.146
How can you sleep in a night like this.
Have you ever seen such a night?

01:17:04.879 --> 01:17:07.813
Mind you, you will have to sleep here.

01:17:11.146 --> 01:17:14.046
Maybe they have things to talk about.

01:17:17.146 --> 01:17:19.079
Let me go to sleep, Bey.

01:17:19.779 --> 01:17:21.113
Excuse me.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:24.146
-Good night.
-Good night.

01:18:12.213 --> 01:18:14.846
Your secret is about to be relieved.

01:18:17.046 --> 01:18:21.479
You will be his, when responsibility
is given to the competent one.

01:18:59.846 --> 01:19:01.613
Hey, traveler!

01:19:01.713 --> 01:19:03.113
What are you doing?

01:19:03.179 --> 01:19:05.613
I thought this was my room.

01:19:07.746 --> 01:19:09.813
The guestroom is this way.

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:12.713
God bless you, brother.

01:19:29.613 --> 01:19:32.113
The brave children of Kayi...

01:19:32.179 --> 01:19:34.746
...I will tell you a story today.

01:19:36.879 --> 01:19:40.679
There is less, but not more in it.

01:19:42.046 --> 01:19:45.046
There is right, but not wrong in it.

01:19:46.479 --> 01:19:49.513
Its name is story, but it is real.

01:19:51.979 --> 01:19:55.113
Years and years ago...

01:19:55.446 --> 01:19:59.679
...in a very hot August day...

01:20:01.579 --> 01:20:05.846
...Sultan Alpaslan
took his army to Malazgirt.

01:20:07.413 --> 01:20:09.046
He was facing the Byzantines.

01:20:09.113 --> 01:20:11.813
His powerful army was waiting...

01:20:11.913 --> 01:20:16.679
...gathered together like an armor.

01:20:18.546 --> 01:20:21.679
The earth was going to move soon.

01:20:22.746 --> 01:20:28.213
The blue sky was going to collapse,
and the brave earth was going to crack.

01:20:28.846 --> 01:20:31.679
The armies were lined like a string.

01:20:33.479 --> 01:20:39.113
The horses with white mains,
red tails and dark skins...

01:20:41.079 --> 01:20:43.546
...were breathing deeply.

01:20:43.913 --> 01:20:50.813
Sultan Alpaslan,
the brave soldier of the Seljuks...

01:20:52.179 --> 01:20:55.613
...as the hero of the earth and seas...

01:20:55.679 --> 01:21:00.613
...seven climates and all Muslims...

01:21:02.579 --> 01:21:06.913
...has worn his shroud on
and got on his horse...

01:21:06.979 --> 01:21:10.746
...whose breath could race the wins...

01:21:12.213 --> 01:21:15.413
...and came before his soldiers.

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:21.979
He shouted with such a strong voice
that the seven climates could hear.

01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:30.546
"My soldiers! There is no sultan
but God in this battlefield.

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:38.113
God is the owner of
all the possessions and lives.

01:21:39.679 --> 01:21:41.746
If there is anybody...

01:21:42.446 --> 01:21:47.946
...who does not want to
fight in this battlefield, he is free.

01:21:48.879 --> 01:21:54.446
However,
he who fights for his tribe...

01:21:54.746 --> 01:21:59.513
...or swings a sword for fame...

01:21:59.579 --> 01:22:03.879
...or take heads
just to prove his might...

01:22:04.046 --> 01:22:06.646
...should know that...

01:22:08.046 --> 01:22:10.413
...he is not one of us.

01:22:11.546 --> 01:22:17.013
Because our aim is to please God.

01:22:18.746 --> 01:22:24.779
Our intention is only
to fly the flag of justice in the skies."

01:22:27.446 --> 01:22:30.113
The brave soldiers in the battlefield...

01:22:30.213 --> 01:22:35.779
...were so full of joy
after this outcry...

01:22:36.613 --> 01:22:39.579
...the earth was so shaken...

01:22:39.846 --> 01:22:44.079
...as these brave men cried out "God!"...

01:22:46.913 --> 01:22:51.546
...the skies burst with their love...

01:22:52.679 --> 01:22:58.779
...neither a mad man like me,
nor a thousand wise man could tell it.

01:22:59.679 --> 01:23:05.646
The horses neighed
and the weapons tore flesh into pieces.

01:23:05.846 --> 01:23:09.879
So many lives were lost,
men lying on the ground, lifeless.

01:23:09.946 --> 01:23:15.813
And so many Alperens have been martyred.

01:23:17.613 --> 01:23:23.946
And then, the army of justice
gained the victory.

01:23:25.546 --> 01:23:32.413
The army of arrogance and persecution
was scattered, destroyed, defeated.

01:23:33.213 --> 01:23:36.813
Then, Diogenes, the commander
of the Byzantine army...

01:23:36.946 --> 01:23:39.546
...was brought to his knees.

01:23:39.679 --> 01:23:45.879
Sultan Alpaslan went towards Diogenes
who was afraid to die.

01:23:46.446 --> 01:23:49.213
He held his arms and
raised him up, saying:

01:23:50.446 --> 01:23:53.679
"You are my guest now."

01:23:54.979 --> 01:23:59.213
He neither broke his heart,
nor hurt his pride.

01:24:00.213 --> 01:24:06.213
After a while,
he sent him back to Byzantine.

01:24:07.113 --> 01:24:08.646
What happened then?

01:24:08.713 --> 01:24:12.213
Let me tell you what happened then.

01:24:12.446 --> 01:24:16.146
Diogen, the commander
of the enemy army...

01:24:16.446 --> 01:24:19.879
...whom Sultan Alpaslan forgave...

01:24:19.946 --> 01:24:22.679
...was not forgiven by Byzantine.

01:24:23.579 --> 01:24:27.746
They poked his eyes,
made his wife a slave...

01:24:28.979 --> 01:24:32.546
...and convicted him to death
in an island.

01:24:34.013 --> 01:24:40.513
Long story short, the poison of
Byzantine is so strong that...

01:24:40.679 --> 01:24:45.679
...you will neither drink it
nor be near it.

01:24:46.013 --> 01:24:52.112
You will be like Sultan Alpaslan...

01:24:52.813 --> 01:24:56.112
...so that God Almighty
will grant you conquers.

01:24:57.179 --> 01:25:01.546
Who knows, maybe he already granted...

01:25:01.713 --> 01:25:06.946
...the conquering of Byzantine
to one of you.

01:25:23.979 --> 01:25:28.013
Your brother Yigit
can stay in the tent, if you like.

01:25:29.813 --> 01:25:33.846
I would raise him as a brave Alp
as his name suggests.

01:25:36.013 --> 01:25:40.813
Your father will understand
how he has been uses by El Aziz.

01:25:43.646 --> 01:25:46.446
I do not know
how I can forgive my father.

01:25:53.979 --> 01:25:55.513
Have some rest.

01:25:56.979 --> 01:26:00.113
Tomorrow, we will have
a long way to the tent.

01:26:53.913 --> 01:26:55.813
What is going on, Afsin Bey?

01:27:10.179 --> 01:27:14.679
I will tell you everything
once we get out of this hell, Shahzade.

01:27:14.746 --> 01:27:17.113
Where are my father and my sister?

01:27:17.579 --> 01:27:19.979
They will join us when they get out.

01:27:21.979 --> 01:27:24.979
Are all of their goods ready there?

01:27:25.213 --> 01:27:27.913
Everything is here.

01:27:36.413 --> 01:27:38.146
Let us go, Shahzade.

01:28:33.013 --> 01:28:34.979
Going somewhere, Dervish?

01:28:35.746 --> 01:28:37.013
Hopefully.

01:28:37.946 --> 01:28:39.546
Where to?

01:28:42.013 --> 01:28:44.846
Wherever my sheikh's heart leads him to.

01:28:45.546 --> 01:28:47.779
Why do you keep asking questions?

01:28:47.879 --> 01:28:50.513
I travel all around.

01:28:51.013 --> 01:28:54.546
I would like to travel
with you all, as well.

01:28:55.213 --> 01:28:56.913
Are we ready, Dervish?

01:28:56.979 --> 01:28:58.213
Yes, master.

01:28:58.713 --> 01:29:00.413
Let us go, then.

01:29:00.479 --> 01:29:02.079
Can I come with you?

01:29:05.113 --> 01:29:08.146
You can. We would accompany each other.

01:29:09.579 --> 01:29:12.146
To accompany each other
is important, Dervish.

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:15.946
They say one's intention
is relieved while on the road.

01:29:16.746 --> 01:29:19.079
Men know each other on the road.

01:29:21.713 --> 01:29:23.179
Come on.

01:29:23.413 --> 01:29:25.546
Thank you, master.

01:29:55.946 --> 01:29:58.646
Ertugrul...

01:29:58.713 --> 01:30:02.013
...must pay for what he has done, Titus.

01:30:03.013 --> 01:30:04.746
Start with Aleppo.

01:30:05.446 --> 01:30:11.579
You know what to do for us to establish an
organization that is stronger than before.

01:30:13.046 --> 01:30:14.713
Good luck.

01:30:42.613 --> 01:30:44.813
Judas...

01:30:46.979 --> 01:30:49.013
I am ready, sir...

01:30:51.213 --> 01:30:57.146
I am ready to go on duty like my brothers.

01:31:47.513 --> 01:31:49.646
What do you want, Mario?

01:31:57.979 --> 01:31:59.779
Father...

01:31:59.846 --> 01:32:02.079
Isadora, my daughter!

01:32:04.479 --> 01:32:07.079
Thank God!

01:32:09.546 --> 01:32:12.213
Oh, thank God!

01:32:35.846 --> 01:32:37.713
Let us take a rest here.

01:32:38.879 --> 01:32:42.513
Prepare the food, and gather up some wood.

01:32:43.213 --> 01:32:46.079
Let me have a talk with this traveler.

01:32:47.913 --> 01:32:49.446
Yes, master.

01:32:57.616 --> 01:32:59.349
Tell me, traveler.

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:01.783
What is going on around the world?

01:33:02.983 --> 01:33:05.983
Where are you from
and where are you headed to?

01:33:07.016 --> 01:33:09.016
I come from Turkistan.

01:33:10.016 --> 01:33:13.583
Genghis Khan's army
destroyed everywhere.

01:33:15.183 --> 01:33:18.649
My eyes saw
so many persecutions and bloodshed.

01:33:19.883 --> 01:33:22.149
Our Prophet said:

01:33:22.249 --> 01:33:25.583
"Infidelity goes on,
but persecution does not."

01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:29.683
A hero will certainly come out
to stop them, hopefully.

01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:33.383
Hopefully, sir. Hopefully.

01:33:38.383 --> 01:33:40.849
Let me help the Dervish.

01:34:04.116 --> 01:34:07.049
Who will protect you now, from me?

01:34:09.749 --> 01:34:12.383
God has a lot of guardians.

01:34:12.716 --> 01:34:15.783
"Lakum deenukum waliya deeni."

01:34:16.749 --> 01:34:20.583
"For you is your religion,
and for me is religion."

01:34:21.183 --> 01:34:26.983
But you need to help me
in order for this persecution to finish.

01:34:30.083 --> 01:34:33.616
I saw what my low-down uncle did
with my own eyes.

01:34:33.683 --> 01:34:37.783
I will do whatever you want.
I just want this persecution to finish.

01:34:37.849 --> 01:34:39.749
But first...

01:34:39.816 --> 01:34:42.716
...before saving me...

01:34:43.016 --> 01:34:45.083
...we will do something.

01:34:45.183 --> 01:34:48.716
I saw my sheikh Ibn al Arabi
in my dream.

01:34:50.249 --> 01:34:52.616
They were talking about him upstairs.

01:34:52.716 --> 01:34:57.016
My uncle and the Cardinal want to take
first his life and then his ark.

01:34:57.083 --> 01:34:59.649
What did he do for that?

01:34:59.716 --> 01:35:05.916
They have beds of fire in hell
for themselves, my daughter.

01:35:08.116 --> 01:35:11.683
My sheikh Ibn al Arabi
came to my dream...

01:35:11.749 --> 01:35:15.816
...and told me to protect the Kayis.

01:35:16.616 --> 01:35:20.816
And I asked him
how I could do this in this dungeon.

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:26.783
He told me I would see
when the time came.

01:35:26.849 --> 01:35:29.949
And the time has come with you,
my daughter.

01:35:30.183 --> 01:35:34.283
Do not allow Petruchio to use Turgut.

01:35:50.683 --> 01:35:52.249
Is the relic in this?

01:35:54.716 --> 01:35:56.183
Talk!

01:35:57.583 --> 01:35:59.149
I said talk, man!

01:35:59.216 --> 01:36:01.583
Master!

01:38:20.849 --> 01:38:22.049
Are you alright?

01:38:22.716 --> 01:38:24.283
Yes.

01:38:27.716 --> 01:38:30.383
Thank God we met again.
We have been missing  you.

01:38:30.616 --> 01:38:31.716
We, too.

01:38:31.816 --> 01:38:33.216
We, too, son.

01:38:35.083 --> 01:38:36.916
Who is this rascal?

01:38:36.983 --> 01:38:38.983
He is one of the trappers.

01:38:39.083 --> 01:38:42.583
One of the ones whose trap
goes against themselves.

01:39:01.349 --> 01:39:03.083
Infidel!

01:39:03.249 --> 01:39:04.383
Infidel!

01:39:04.616 --> 01:39:06.049
Where are you?

01:39:10.749 --> 01:39:12.849
He runs like a bat out of hell.

01:39:19.083 --> 01:39:20.583
Come on.

01:39:49.583 --> 01:39:52.149
I see the lovers came together, Dervish.

01:39:54.983 --> 01:39:57.816
May God keep them together.

01:39:57.916 --> 01:40:00.616
Keep their generation pure.

01:40:00.716 --> 01:40:03.049
Enhance their love towards each other.

01:40:03.116 --> 01:40:07.049
May them have
such a good generation that...

01:40:07.116 --> 01:40:10.749
...the humankind
reaches justice by favor of them.

01:40:15.916 --> 01:40:16.916
Amin.

01:40:16.983 --> 01:40:18.683
Amin.

01:40:19.249 --> 01:40:20.916
Where are you headed to?

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:25.816
To the Kayi Tent,
if you accept us as guests.

01:40:27.183 --> 01:40:28.916
It would be an honor.

01:40:29.016 --> 01:40:31.016
Let us go back together.

01:40:32.783 --> 01:40:33.816
Thank you.

01:40:33.883 --> 01:40:36.116
Bey, the infidel ran away.

01:40:36.849 --> 01:40:39.949
We will turn up somewhere, eventually.

01:40:43.283 --> 01:40:44.749
Are you okay?

01:41:14.383 --> 01:41:16.216
Good day, Wild Demir.

01:41:16.316 --> 01:41:19.083
-Thank you.
-No, sit down. Sit down.

01:41:21.583 --> 01:41:23.183
I brought this to my Aykiz.

01:41:23.283 --> 01:41:25.316
This will be good for her.

01:41:25.716 --> 01:41:27.149
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

01:41:27.849 --> 01:41:30.049
Did you talk to Aykiz
about Selcan's baby?

01:41:30.116 --> 01:41:32.249
I did, Mother Hayme. I did.

01:41:32.316 --> 01:41:33.816
What did she say?

01:41:36.316 --> 01:41:38.283
Wild Demir, say something!

01:41:38.383 --> 01:41:42.049
Say it, so that
nothing remains unsaid or unknown.

01:41:43.816 --> 01:41:45.749
She walked up to Aykiz.

01:41:46.683 --> 01:41:48.116
She slapped Aykiz.

01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:53.183
And she wanted to walk away
because she was pregnant.

01:41:53.249 --> 01:41:54.749
She grabbed her by the arm.

01:41:54.816 --> 01:41:56.049
She pushed her around.

01:41:56.116 --> 01:42:00.883
When Aykiz pulled her arm
to free herself, she fell down.

01:42:01.916 --> 01:42:03.383
You know the rest.

01:42:04.816 --> 01:42:06.816
Why did she walk up to her?

01:42:09.083 --> 01:42:11.816
Say something, Wild Demir.
Say something!

01:42:12.183 --> 01:42:14.749
She wanted to open the old crates.

01:42:17.249 --> 01:42:20.849
Selcan's father. Alptekin.

01:42:22.049 --> 01:42:24.016
Alptekin.

01:42:39.116 --> 01:42:40.349
Selcan!

01:42:46.116 --> 01:42:49.216
-Is there a problem, Ana?
-Take a walk, girl.

01:43:01.349 --> 01:43:07.049
What is it? Now you came
to take your son out of my bed?

01:43:11.349 --> 01:43:15.749
If the good dream became a nightmare...

01:43:17.016 --> 01:43:21.149
...and your bed
swallows a man like a swamp...

01:43:21.783 --> 01:43:23.683
...I will take my son...

01:43:23.783 --> 01:43:28.616
...and throw your blackened blossom
to the ground, Selcan!

01:43:29.349 --> 01:43:33.083
It seems that somebody has envenomed you.

01:43:33.383 --> 01:43:35.783
Spill it, so that it will not
pile up inside you.

01:43:35.883 --> 01:43:38.883
What did you hear from whom
and walked all over our tent?

01:43:38.949 --> 01:43:41.916
What is it with opening the old crate?

01:43:42.616 --> 01:43:45.149
The crates of the heart
have closed, Ana.

01:43:45.216 --> 01:43:47.916
They are buried deep
in Euphrates' cold waters.

01:43:47.983 --> 01:43:50.949
The last crate I opened
was my dowry crate.

01:43:51.816 --> 01:43:54.183
I had taken my baby's clothes from it.

01:43:54.249 --> 01:43:57.349
And now my fate is
to put them back inside.

01:43:57.583 --> 01:44:01.183
So, what about Alptekin?

01:44:02.983 --> 01:44:04.783
What about my father?

01:44:05.383 --> 01:44:09.816
I heard that
his ghost is wandering about in his tent.

01:44:11.116 --> 01:44:12.983
The people who said this
would also say...

01:44:13.049 --> 01:44:15.249
..."The mother killed her baby."

01:44:15.616 --> 01:44:18.316
It is just a matter of bad heart.

01:44:23.116 --> 01:44:24.716
What is it, mother?

01:44:28.949 --> 01:44:31.883
Mother wants to ask me
about her grandchild.

01:44:33.016 --> 01:44:35.816
But she came to the wrong tent.

01:44:35.949 --> 01:44:38.283
-Selcan, you...
-Mother!

01:44:40.116 --> 01:44:42.316
What is Selcan talking about?

01:44:45.083 --> 01:44:46.816
Nothing, son.

01:44:46.916 --> 01:44:49.383
You cannot turn your back and walk away.

01:44:50.983 --> 01:44:54.749
How can you hold the mother responsible
for the baby's death?

01:44:57.383 --> 01:44:59.049
Gundogdu...

01:45:00.216 --> 01:45:02.183
I want peace, son.

01:45:02.816 --> 01:45:04.383
Just peace.

01:45:05.116 --> 01:45:07.849
We all want peace, mother.
All of us.

01:45:10.883 --> 01:45:15.716
But we will not find peace
as long as Ertugrul is after that girl.

01:45:16.616 --> 01:45:21.316
There is no peace in the tent after he
came back from hunting with that girl.

01:45:21.383 --> 01:45:23.283
What is Ertugrul trying to do?

01:45:23.383 --> 01:45:25.916
Why does he want to marry
that shahzade's daughter?

01:45:25.983 --> 01:45:28.083
Have you ever thought about it?

01:45:28.349 --> 01:45:31.949
My brother is
on the dirty trails of politics.

01:45:32.183 --> 01:45:35.183
There is no peace for us from now on.

01:46:32.283 --> 01:46:33.983
What is it?

01:46:35.949 --> 01:46:37.083
Nothing.

01:46:38.016 --> 01:46:40.916
I could have been
neither a bey nor a man...

01:46:41.349 --> 01:46:46.349
...if I could not see that
my wife is worried about something.

01:46:54.183 --> 01:46:55.749
I talked to Selcan.

01:46:57.049 --> 01:46:58.349
What did she say?

01:46:59.849 --> 01:47:03.183
They know that Ertugrul
is in love with Halime.

01:47:04.883 --> 01:47:07.749
Is there anybody who does not know that?

01:47:08.616 --> 01:47:14.249
Everybody in the tent
waits for the words you will say.

01:47:14.949 --> 01:47:19.983
The decision you will make
will either disquiet Gundogdu's tent...

01:47:20.783 --> 01:47:22.716
...or Ertugrul's.

01:47:25.949 --> 01:47:28.183
Does Gundogdu agree with his woman?

01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:32.849
Yes.

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:37.816
What are you going to do?

01:47:39.249 --> 01:47:41.849
I will wait for Ertugrul to come back.

01:47:41.916 --> 01:47:44.349
What if he comes back with Halime?

01:49:12.783 --> 01:49:14.183
What is going on, Bey?

01:49:14.283 --> 01:49:16.649
Do not forget this moment.

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:22.749
Look at this young man who looks like
he will destroy Byzantine if they let him.

01:49:23.616 --> 01:49:26.383
If my wit is telling me the truth...

01:49:26.616 --> 01:49:28.883
...he is the new Bey of the Kayis.

01:49:28.949 --> 01:49:30.116
What?

01:49:30.616 --> 01:49:32.749
What are you saying, Bey?

01:49:32.816 --> 01:49:35.016
I know very well what I am saying.

01:49:35.083 --> 01:49:40.916
If we cannot prevent his,
he will also be the last Bey of the Kayis.

01:49:46.683 --> 01:49:48.383
My Alps will attend to you.

01:49:48.849 --> 01:49:50.616
I will visit you later.

01:49:50.683 --> 01:49:51.949
Thank you.

01:50:31.016 --> 01:50:32.249
Welcome, son.

01:50:36.383 --> 01:50:37.883
Thank you, mother.

01:50:48.349 --> 01:50:49.849
Welcome, my girl.

01:50:50.383 --> 01:50:52.083
Thank you, Mother Hayme.

01:51:18.849 --> 01:51:20.083
Bey...

01:51:20.716 --> 01:51:24.616
Halime Sultan would like to greet you,
if she is allowed.

01:51:24.683 --> 01:51:26.216
Welcome, Halime Sultan.

01:51:29.683 --> 01:51:32.883
I would like to kiss your hand,
if I am allowed.

01:51:32.949 --> 01:51:34.216
No, please.

01:51:43.149 --> 01:51:47.383
Suleyman Shah, who I am does not matter
even a bit in front of you.

01:51:47.616 --> 01:51:51.616
You did everything you could
to save my family's life.

01:51:53.983 --> 01:51:58.949
You are always a Bey
whom I will always see as a father.

01:52:08.683 --> 01:52:10.349
Thank you, my girl.

01:52:11.683 --> 01:52:13.949
Mother Hayme  will take care of you.

01:52:16.949 --> 01:52:19.116
Come on, my girl.

01:52:29.983 --> 01:52:35.183
The Bey who saved the beautiful daughter
of the Sultan from the furious enemy...

01:52:35.383 --> 01:52:37.749
...brought the girl to the tent.

01:52:37.816 --> 01:52:41.016
He put the infidels in their place
with his sword.

01:52:42.283 --> 01:52:43.749
What are you talking about?

01:52:43.849 --> 01:52:45.649
You can see it only in tales.

01:52:45.849 --> 01:52:48.049
Now, wait for the havoc.

01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:50.883
Let us see what Selcan is up to.

01:52:53.383 --> 01:52:57.083
Uneasy lies the head
that wears a crown, brother.

01:52:57.149 --> 01:52:59.249
Let us go and slaughter a lamb.

01:52:59.349 --> 01:53:02.316
I am so hungry that
I could choke down a whole camel.

01:53:02.383 --> 01:53:04.049
Lovely!

01:53:04.116 --> 01:53:09.316
Let us settle our guests in their tents
and then visit Nasir.

01:53:09.816 --> 01:53:12.049
I want him to hear that
he is going to die from us.

01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:15.083
Then we can eat
as much as we want. Come on.

01:53:18.116 --> 01:53:19.383
Please, please.

01:53:29.216 --> 01:53:33.049
So, Ertugrul, tell me what happened.

01:53:34.249 --> 01:53:37.249
Bey, Commander Gunhan
would like to see you.

01:53:38.249 --> 01:53:39.849
Let him in.

01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:42.016
Let the commander in!

01:53:54.049 --> 01:53:57.616
Commander, I am surprised that
you did not come...

01:53:57.849 --> 01:54:01.683
...thrusting your sword
towards our face this time.

01:54:04.049 --> 01:54:09.316
I came here to ask
you, all the beys and your people...

01:54:09.583 --> 01:54:13.149
...to accept our apologies.

01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:21.283
I apologize not only on behalf of myself,
but also on behalf of Hazrat Emir.

01:54:23.816 --> 01:54:27.683
Our army will stop the siege immediately.

01:54:27.749 --> 01:54:31.249
We will pay all the damage we have caused.

01:54:35.783 --> 01:54:40.949
Atabey, Hazrat Emir
declared your freedom in his letter.

01:54:42.116 --> 01:54:46.016
He ordered you to command the army
during the withdrawal.

01:54:57.649 --> 01:54:59.083
Your seal.

01:55:07.249 --> 01:55:09.616
And this is your declaration.

01:55:35.783 --> 01:55:39.116
So, what about that demon
called Nasir?

01:55:53.116 --> 01:55:54.783
We are here!

01:55:57.083 --> 01:56:00.049
We did not want you to die
without seeing us.

01:56:02.983 --> 01:56:05.683
You must have heard from the guardsmen.

01:56:05.749 --> 01:56:08.683
El Aziz has written a letter
to Suleyman Shah.

01:56:08.749 --> 01:56:09.916
What a letter, though!

01:56:09.983 --> 01:56:14.316
Since he is a poet,
he wrote it in such a beautiful way.

01:56:15.949 --> 01:56:20.016
Atabey Sehabettin came back to work.

01:56:22.783 --> 01:56:27.183
He is taking the armies
you have sent for us back.

01:56:32.249 --> 01:56:35.149
You will beg to die in their hands.

01:56:40.183 --> 01:56:42.183
Do not worry about us.

01:56:43.116 --> 01:56:45.949
We will take care of ourselves.

01:56:46.716 --> 01:56:49.816
How would you like to die?

01:56:51.383 --> 01:56:55.116
With saucy jokes
like you have been doing to our bey?

01:56:55.216 --> 01:56:58.683
Or by burning like Eftelya?

01:57:00.083 --> 01:57:03.216
Or like in the first day
we came to the palace ...

01:57:03.683 --> 01:57:07.149
...which you wanted to chop our Bey
after drugging him?

01:57:08.049 --> 01:57:12.616
Or with foams in your mouth
like a rabid dog?

01:57:18.949 --> 01:57:20.816
Would you like me to tell?

01:58:25.383 --> 01:58:28.049
The great and the good people.

01:58:28.116 --> 01:58:30.316
The Beys of my tent.

01:58:31.083 --> 01:58:34.283
My sisters, my brothers.

01:58:35.349 --> 01:58:37.083
My brave Alps.

01:58:37.816 --> 01:58:39.349
My Alperens.

01:58:40.816 --> 01:58:45.083
We have overcome so many troubles...

01:58:46.049 --> 01:58:48.649
...since the day we left Otukan.

01:58:48.716 --> 01:58:50.783
We fought so many enemies.

01:58:50.883 --> 01:58:53.049
We challenged so many persecutors.

01:58:53.183 --> 01:58:59.783
Today, the Islamic world is being played
one against each other with traps.

01:59:00.916 --> 01:59:03.216
The army of the thug named Cengiz...

01:59:03.316 --> 01:59:09.783
...destroyed Samarkand, Bukhara
and so many other holy cities.

01:59:11.016 --> 01:59:16.916
The Crusaders have been coming at us
for years in order to destroy us.

01:59:17.783 --> 01:59:19.883
While the conditions are this hard...

01:59:20.016 --> 01:59:22.083
...we are at odds with each other.

01:59:22.983 --> 01:59:26.349
May God protect the brotherhood
of the Islamic world.

01:59:26.583 --> 01:59:28.616
Amin!

01:59:29.849 --> 01:59:32.916
The world waits for
a new resurrection from us.

01:59:33.916 --> 01:59:38.016
They want justice and they do not want
the brotherhood to collapse.

01:59:38.783 --> 01:59:40.983
The brave people of Kayi...

01:59:41.983 --> 01:59:45.916
...from now on, our weapons
will not stay in their sheaths.

01:59:46.816 --> 01:59:50.083
There will not be defense anymore.
There will be conquests.

01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:52.249
Be ready for war anytime.

01:59:57.783 --> 02:00:00.216
Ertugrul.

02:00:01.683 --> 02:00:05.049
Punish this man who persecuted you
in Aleppo yourself.

02:00:06.316 --> 02:00:08.583
It is you who has the right to.

02:00:14.616 --> 02:00:17.616
Victory is with the man who has the sword.

02:00:24.749 --> 02:00:28.316
The man who gains the victory,
takes the seigniory, Gundogdu.

02:00:52.216 --> 02:00:57.349
God is the best of schemers.

02:00:58.849 --> 02:01:00.849
God, you are merciful.

02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:04.749
Forgive this man's sins.
