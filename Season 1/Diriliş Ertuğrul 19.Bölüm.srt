Episode 19 will start after 12:26 min

12:26.467 --> 12:29.467
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:31.506 --> 12:34.506
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:35.693 --> 12:38.693
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:44.873 --> 12:49.107
Beys, when the time comes,
the die will surely be cast.

12:50.840 --> 12:55.140
Until that time, we will not say anything.

12:56.940 --> 12:59.973
However, be ready at all times.

14:22.973 --> 14:24.173
Brother Turgut...

14:27.873 --> 14:29.573
Brother Turgut...

14:41.307 --> 14:43.940
Come on, get up, brother Turgut.

14:44.007 --> 14:46.073
Let us go out and get some air.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.640
See  your tent.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.973
See your tent, so that you get well.

15:26.873 --> 15:29.073
This time Gundogdu came against you.

15:29.140 --> 15:30.773
This is how the Kayis are.

15:30.840 --> 15:32.907
One of them dies,
a thousand of them resurrects.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.273
Are you playing with us?

15:35.507 --> 15:36.640
What do you mean?

15:36.740 --> 15:38.907
We knew that
you won Gundogdu over.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.973
How did he suddenly
happen to be our biggest enemy?

15:43.040 --> 15:45.707
Gundogdu deceived me, as well.

15:45.773 --> 15:48.507
But I will give him one last chance.

15:48.573 --> 15:49.640
What do you mean?

15:49.707 --> 15:52.807
I waved the riot flag for him
in the tent.

15:52.907 --> 15:55.673
He will either do
what is necessary, or die.

15:56.740 --> 15:59.240
And we are giving you a last chance.

16:00.207 --> 16:04.640
You either finish this,
or just like Gundogdu...

16:13.973 --> 16:16.773
This is the water of life for Turgut Alp.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.907
The Grandmaster
does not want to give up on him.

16:19.973 --> 16:22.673
He wants to use him when the time comes.

16:23.307 --> 16:25.007
Isadora came to the tent.

16:25.107 --> 16:26.873
Thankfully, she did not recognize me.

16:26.940 --> 16:28.973
We know what she is up to.

16:29.773 --> 16:31.273
She will pay for it.

16:32.907 --> 16:35.807
May I take that gold you promised me?

16:43.573 --> 16:48.173
Take that tent of yours, and get out of
these lands as soon as possible.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.940
Here, Turgut Alp.

17:50.607 --> 17:52.640
I thought some air
would be good for him.

17:52.707 --> 17:56.007
His brother's mercy
will be better for him, Bey.

18:05.207 --> 18:06.807
Bey...

18:08.707 --> 18:11.673
I lost one of my children
to the enemy.

18:14.573 --> 18:16.807
Let us not lose another.

18:46.640 --> 18:47.840
Come on.

18:47.907 --> 18:50.107
Come with me, Turgut Alp.

19:10.707 --> 19:12.273
Sister...

19:28.573 --> 19:30.507
What is it, Yigit?

19:31.273 --> 19:33.207
I made up my mind.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.707
I will accept Sultan Alaeddin's offer.

19:37.740 --> 19:39.507
I will go to Kayseri.

19:39.573 --> 19:41.707
Yigit, what are you saying?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.707
I thought you wanted to be an Alp.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.907
Sister, brother Ertugrul
loves you very much.

19:47.973 --> 19:50.607
You will be happy here with him.

19:50.673 --> 19:51.840
What about me?

19:53.573 --> 19:57.940
I need to be near my uncle Alaeddin,
so that he would not get worried.

19:58.007 --> 19:59.773
This is the best choice.

20:01.640 --> 20:03.873
How can I remain separate from you?

20:06.140 --> 20:07.840
May I come in?

20:09.040 --> 20:10.573
Come in, Aykiz.

20:13.573 --> 20:15.973
I brought you some of the meal
I just cooked.

20:16.073 --> 20:17.973
Have some, while it is still warm.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.707
Thank you, Aykiz.

20:22.173 --> 20:23.640
How are you?

20:24.607 --> 20:29.140
I am good, but
there are black clouds over the tent.

20:29.873 --> 20:32.040
Anything can happen any moment.

20:42.773 --> 20:44.673
Beys know and love you.

20:46.007 --> 20:48.640
They also know
how much you love your father.

20:48.707 --> 20:51.840
But do not stay hesitant in front of them.

20:52.140 --> 20:54.740
Woman, do not worry.

20:55.773 --> 20:58.207
Do you think I do not know the time?

20:58.273 --> 21:00.540
Let this night pass first...

21:00.607 --> 21:03.607
We will se
what we are going to do after that.

21:18.507 --> 21:22.807
The time is now,
however, you do not see that, Gundogdu.

21:23.807 --> 21:26.240
But you will see soon.

21:53.534 --> 21:58.401
Bey, the fire inside you
will burn even me. Here.

22:11.268 --> 22:15.934
I have not been saying anything to the
tactless people in the tent for so long.

22:16.001 --> 22:20.368
But they started instigations
taking courage from that.

22:21.268 --> 22:23.034
And the worst thing is that...

22:23.101 --> 22:27.368
...the person who started the instigations
is my blood brother Kurdoglu.

22:28.168 --> 22:30.568
Oh, Bey...

22:30.668 --> 22:34.134
This is not the first time
Kurdoglu acts tactless.

22:34.268 --> 22:36.968
Remember how many times
I have told you.

22:39.134 --> 22:42.034
I have not been saying anything
for so long.

22:42.101 --> 22:45.968
I wanted my tent to be in peace...

22:47.134 --> 22:50.934
...while the Islamic world
is struggling with instigations.

22:52.501 --> 22:56.634
Sometimes you have to disregard
the tactless acts when you are a bey.

22:58.001 --> 23:03.234
Just like a father does not punish his
children every time they get spoiled...

23:03.301 --> 23:07.634
...a bey does also not punish his people
everytime they make a mistake.

23:10.034 --> 23:12.001
What are you planning to do?

23:13.234 --> 23:18.301
Kurdoglu and his people
want to finish me as a bey in the tent.

23:19.501 --> 23:21.934
They want to put Gundogdu forward.

23:23.668 --> 23:26.468
And I will give them this opportunity.

23:26.568 --> 23:28.634
Let us see if they will succeed.

24:10.201 --> 24:12.134
Brother Turgut!

24:13.034 --> 24:16.068
So many trainings
we have had here with you.

24:17.368 --> 24:19.134
Do you remember, brother?

24:27.434 --> 24:30.468
Keep your eyes open.
Be always cautious.

24:32.401 --> 24:36.501
Bey, is it needless for us to get worried
that the storm is coming?

24:40.134 --> 24:41.901
It is not needless.

24:41.968 --> 24:46.468
May your eyes, ears and weapons
be ready for the storm.

24:49.501 --> 24:54.468
May your weapons not miss
what eyes see and ears hear.

24:56.068 --> 24:57.534
Understood, Bey.

24:57.601 --> 24:59.601
-Understood.
-Understood, Bey.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.168
Alright, take Turgut Alp to his tent.

25:04.901 --> 25:06.434
Come on, brother.

25:31.668 --> 25:33.468
Do you need anything?

25:35.468 --> 25:37.268
Thank you, Ertugrul Bey.

25:43.501 --> 25:46.301
The feast that Gundogdu Bey
is giving tonight...

25:46.368 --> 25:48.368
Why is everybody so tense?

25:50.134 --> 25:52.601
That is why
I could not talk to my father.

25:53.568 --> 25:55.934
I will talk about his legacy
after the feast.

25:56.001 --> 25:57.534
His legacy about Gokce?

25:57.601 --> 25:58.901
Yes.

26:04.368 --> 26:07.601
Anyway. Do not worry about these, now.

26:08.434 --> 26:10.968
Think about the wedding preparations.

26:12.901 --> 26:14.568
I am scared, Ertugrul.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.201
Halime Sultan...

26:19.268 --> 26:21.134
My beautiful eyed woman...

26:21.201 --> 26:24.934
Do not let fear capture your heart
as long as I am with you.

26:28.034 --> 26:31.334
I will make a very big wedding
in this tent for you.

27:08.434 --> 27:10.134
Bey?

27:10.868 --> 27:13.001
Is that not the sword you used...

27:13.068 --> 27:17.434
...when Selcan's father Alptekin
started the riot?

27:22.134 --> 27:24.401
My father gave this sword to me.

27:26.068 --> 27:29.568
He said, while
he was giving this to me...

27:29.634 --> 27:33.434
..."Son, there should not be two heads
in a seigniory.

27:34.601 --> 27:37.301
If anyone has his eyes
on your marquee...

27:37.401 --> 27:41.334
...you will not have mercy to anybody."

27:44.301 --> 27:50.068
But, what if it is your son
that has his eyes on your marquee?

27:54.134 --> 27:59.268
One takes even his son's life when
necessary, for the unity of the marquee.

28:00.434 --> 28:05.901
So that lives will not be lost
for the fight for the throne.

28:19.534 --> 28:22.201
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you.

28:38.968 --> 28:42.134
People will see you as the holiest Bey...

28:42.234 --> 28:47.034
...as long as you serve meat
and lay a bed under him.

28:48.268 --> 28:52.268
So, you do not count any other man
other than Gundogdu as a bey.

28:52.334 --> 28:57.434
It is important
what these people say, not me.

28:58.868 --> 29:01.368
They already gave their decisions.

29:12.934 --> 29:15.268
Brother... are these two not...

29:16.034 --> 29:18.501
Yes. Kurdoglu's worms...

29:19.401 --> 29:22.334
They gnaw on the flock owners
and shepherds.

29:22.401 --> 29:25.901
I wish I could take them
and throw them into the boiler.

29:26.001 --> 29:28.468
And let them gnaw on their own flesh.

29:34.368 --> 29:37.068
Wait! You, suckling veal!

29:37.168 --> 29:41.001
I thought you would not eat anything
that Gundogdu serves.

30:20.368 --> 30:22.101
My girl, Gokce...

30:28.901 --> 30:31.068
God bless you.

30:32.234 --> 30:34.534
You saved my son's life.

30:46.034 --> 30:49.034
Did you come
to ease your conscience, mother?

30:53.068 --> 30:57.968
I would want to be forgiven my God
if I have committed a sin.

30:58.668 --> 31:03.301
However, I do not have a guilty conscience
that I cannot freed myself from.

31:04.668 --> 31:08.268
My sister took the risk of
giving her life for Ertugrul.

31:08.634 --> 31:13.401
But you did not keep your promise
that you gave to Gokce.

31:15.201 --> 31:18.101
You started to look for women...

31:18.201 --> 31:21.368
...because I could not
keep my husband's baby inside me.

31:21.434 --> 31:24.301
Even streaming water
has sweeps in it.

31:24.934 --> 31:27.601
What kind of conscience is yours?

31:31.468 --> 31:35.401
You have your eyes
on being the woman of the marquee.

31:36.234 --> 31:38.534
That is why you cannot see anything.

31:39.501 --> 31:43.301
You feel neither
my daughter Gokce's pangs of love...

31:45.201 --> 31:49.101
...nor you keep track of
what you have done to my Gundogdu.

31:51.168 --> 31:53.534
Or be sorry for your baby.

31:54.334 --> 31:56.568
Let me tell you something.

31:56.668 --> 32:00.434
Try to put a baby in your belly
immediately.

32:02.401 --> 32:05.668
Otherwise, even you
cannot hold Gundogdu.

32:38.868 --> 32:41.234
I will take your revenge, father.

32:45.268 --> 32:46.901
I will.

33:13.234 --> 33:16.334
-Welcome, Bey.
-Peace be upon you.

33:16.401 --> 33:19.168
-Welcome, Bey!
-Welcome, Gundogdu Bey!

33:19.234 --> 33:22.668
Long live, Gundogdu Bey!

33:23.201 --> 33:27.601
-Long live, Bey!
-Long live, Gundogdu Bey!

33:29.134 --> 33:31.134
Long live, Gundogdu Bey!

33:48.668 --> 33:52.868
My father is also angry at Ertugrul,
but he does not show it.

33:54.301 --> 33:58.301
He thinks it is clear that
who the tent's future bey will be.

33:59.034 --> 34:03.168
He keeps saying "It is clear,
but he is not aware of this."

34:04.634 --> 34:09.668
You cannot make him sit in the marquee
and get worried about people's worries.

34:11.268 --> 34:15.901
He is an Alp bey
who cannot fin into the marquee.

34:18.168 --> 34:22.968
You see what he is going through
even though you are not his wife yet.

34:23.034 --> 34:26.601
And what are you going to do?

34:30.268 --> 34:35.268
You said it was not easy
to be an Alp's wife when I first met you.

34:37.568 --> 34:40.634
I was aware of this
when I came to my brave man.

34:44.034 --> 34:47.634
If we are meant to wait...

34:47.901 --> 34:53.168
...we can only pray to God
to grant us to wait a lifetime.

35:31.434 --> 35:33.034
Bey!

35:35.201 --> 35:37.368
Your seat is ready here.

35:37.434 --> 35:40.334
We are your guest tonight, son.

35:42.001 --> 35:43.601
Our seat is alright.

36:13.168 --> 36:15.868
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you.

37:03.268 --> 37:07.668
Bey, I wish you have not invited us here.
We do not know why we are here.

37:07.901 --> 37:12.901
It is not Karabudun's black tent, brother.
We are together with our elder.

37:13.501 --> 37:16.301
-Bey, but...
-Anyway.

37:17.268 --> 37:18.901
He is our elder.

37:18.968 --> 37:20.434
He is our ancestor.

37:20.534 --> 37:22.101
He is our superior.

37:25.301 --> 37:28.034
He has my father's essence
within himself.

37:29.568 --> 37:32.668
He will find the right way
when the time comes.

37:32.901 --> 37:34.134
Alright, Bey.

37:44.068 --> 37:45.468
Thank you.

38:01.968 --> 38:05.101
Welcome all.
I am glad you all came.

38:13.668 --> 38:15.434
Please. Enjoy it.

38:16.301 --> 38:19.301
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

38:25.468 --> 38:26.934
Thank you.

39:06.068 --> 39:08.068
Do not worry about your father.

39:08.134 --> 39:12.134
It is not easy. He has been
this tent's bey for so long.

39:12.234 --> 39:17.168
The problem is not him withdrawing,
it is him realizing he got older.

39:18.534 --> 39:21.634
You showed everybody
who you are with this feast.

39:22.534 --> 39:26.101
Your father will eventually
accept this reality.

39:31.601 --> 39:33.868
Bey, please eat something.

40:21.301 --> 40:25.001
Beys, Alps...

40:26.334 --> 40:28.168
...shepherds...

40:28.234 --> 40:30.468
...the valuable people of the tent...

40:30.534 --> 40:34.868
Thankfully, our tent
found a land for itself...

40:34.968 --> 40:40.668
...after very hard times
with the effort of my children.

40:41.001 --> 40:43.601
-Thank God!
-Thank God!

40:43.668 --> 40:46.234
-Thank God!
-Thank God!

40:46.868 --> 40:53.668
After hard times, our weak flock
was sold more than its normal price...

40:54.068 --> 40:57.968
...with the efforts of my son Gundogdu.

40:59.168 --> 41:01.101
And this relieved you all.

41:02.168 --> 41:06.201
Thank God for these days.

41:06.501 --> 41:11.434
God bless our Bey,
our children and our Alps.

41:11.501 --> 41:13.868
Amen!

41:13.968 --> 41:15.301
Amen.

41:15.368 --> 41:16.934
Amen.

41:17.034 --> 41:23.334
I have been serving to you
as the bey of tent for years.

41:25.534 --> 41:31.401
We reached today
with all our good deeds and mistakes.

41:31.501 --> 41:33.368
But we got older now.

41:34.168 --> 41:36.668
I thought about it and wondered...

41:37.001 --> 41:40.168
...if the beys and our people...

41:40.234 --> 41:42.501
...would like to see another bey
in the marquee.

41:42.568 --> 41:45.301
-Of course not, Bey!
-Of course not, Bey!

41:46.401 --> 41:48.634
-Of course not, Bey!
-Of course not, Bey!

41:49.201 --> 41:50.668
We cannot do without you.

41:50.901 --> 41:52.968
Of course not. You are our leader.

41:53.034 --> 41:55.034
Of course not, Bey.

41:59.401 --> 42:02.234
My decision is that...

42:02.301 --> 42:07.234
...there'll be an election in seigniory
that is going to take place in two days.

42:16.468 --> 42:20.101
If there is anyone among you
who sees himself fit to be a bey...

42:20.168 --> 42:21.934
...this is his time.

42:22.334 --> 42:24.201
He is more than welcome.

42:45.101 --> 42:46.468
Wild Demir...

42:47.268 --> 42:49.368
...give me some of that meat.

42:50.868 --> 42:53.501
Let us benefit from our son's feast.

42:53.901 --> 42:55.001
Here, Bey.

43:08.101 --> 43:09.668
Is your sword with you?

43:11.001 --> 43:12.334
Always, Bey.

43:12.868 --> 43:14.934
It is always at your service.

43:15.334 --> 43:17.068
Let us keep it this way.

43:17.168 --> 43:19.468
When the game for being the bey starts...

43:19.534 --> 43:22.101
...only God knows how it will end.

43:42.368 --> 43:44.901
What is my father up to, uncle?

43:46.268 --> 43:49.434
You do two things
when a bull comes running towards you...

43:49.501 --> 43:52.968
...you either confront it...

43:53.868 --> 43:55.001
...or run away.

43:59.268 --> 44:02.934
If you run away,
you cannot escape from the bull.

44:03.001 --> 44:07.168
But if you stand straight against
and confront it...

44:08.434 --> 44:10.968
...there is a chance to be saved.

44:12.468 --> 44:16.368
Good luck. Your time as a bey
has started, Gundogdu.

44:27.634 --> 44:30.634
Bey, what is going on for God's sake?

44:32.901 --> 44:35.634
My mother always said this,
but I did not get it.

44:35.901 --> 44:37.068
Now I do.

44:37.134 --> 44:38.501
You got what, Bey?

44:40.234 --> 44:43.668
She said, "Make it or break it."

44:47.068 --> 44:48.601
Meaning?

44:51.234 --> 44:53.668
We will make it, if God permits.

45:15.401 --> 45:17.468
God bless you, woman.

45:17.534 --> 45:19.101
Enjoy it.

45:21.134 --> 45:24.301
Do you think only the beys
are worried about all this?

45:24.368 --> 45:26.334
Women also think it is enough.

45:27.534 --> 45:30.634
Woman, I am aware of the situation.

45:30.868 --> 45:33.101
But my father is still alive.

45:33.901 --> 45:38.968
He is alive, but I did not understand
why he wanted to withdraw.

45:40.068 --> 45:42.101
Your father got older.

45:42.168 --> 45:44.034
He is aware of the reality.

45:44.101 --> 45:46.868
You should be up for being the bey.

45:48.468 --> 45:51.634
But why does he keep the seat
open for everybody...

45:51.868 --> 45:54.601
...instead of leaving it to his sons?

45:57.868 --> 45:59.168
You are right.

46:00.568 --> 46:04.501
Suleyman Shah would not
throw himself into this without a reason.

46:06.034 --> 46:08.301
You must watch around first.

46:09.168 --> 46:12.668
Kurdoglu and the other beys
said they were going to obey you.

46:12.901 --> 46:15.168
Do not expect anything from them
from now on.

46:15.234 --> 46:19.134
Everybody waits for two words
that will come out of your mouth.

46:35.334 --> 46:38.334
Where did this election idea
come from, Bey?

46:38.401 --> 46:42.601
I wanted to see
if they can make a decision without me.

46:44.568 --> 46:49.168
I wanted to see the hatred in them
to be revealed.

46:50.968 --> 46:53.134
They think it is easy to be a bey.

46:54.268 --> 46:57.568
I invited them to the field of contest.

46:58.868 --> 47:02.168
Let us see
how much power and reasoning they have.

47:06.168 --> 47:09.434
You surely know the best, Bey.

47:25.634 --> 47:27.101
Aktolgali...

47:29.034 --> 47:31.601
...our Beys bring the mountains
to their knees.

47:31.668 --> 47:34.334
God gives your weapons
at your service...

47:34.434 --> 47:37.134
...but he does not let the hearts unite.

47:38.168 --> 47:41.434
When your heart starts to beat
for being the bey once...

47:41.501 --> 47:44.568
...it is much better for you
to be captured.

47:46.501 --> 47:49.301
When this ambition captures your soul...

47:50.134 --> 47:53.134
...be sure that
you heart is thrown into the fire.

47:55.868 --> 47:58.901
May God protect our heart
from that ambition.

47:59.268 --> 48:02.034
Let us always pursue God's blessing.

48:03.068 --> 48:07.001
Let us be the ones who are given duty,
instead of asking for it.

48:07.101 --> 48:09.868
So that our heart will stay pure.

48:09.968 --> 48:12.334
Let us hold our heads high
in this world...

48:12.401 --> 48:15.668
...in which we cannot control
even a single breath.

48:34.034 --> 48:35.434
Turgut...

48:40.934 --> 48:42.368
My Turgut...

48:42.434 --> 48:44.234
I brought you some food.

48:44.301 --> 48:46.434
Come on, open your eyes.

48:46.501 --> 48:48.501
Come on, I am begging you.

48:53.134 --> 48:54.601
Come on, I am begging you.

48:54.668 --> 48:56.301
Come on, wake up.

49:10.068 --> 49:11.168
Turgut...

49:27.168 --> 49:28.268
Turgut...

50:03.968 --> 50:06.434
The old man is clever than I thought.

50:07.668 --> 50:10.201
You have to hand it to him.

50:10.968 --> 50:17.134
That old man could put
50 men like you in his boots.

50:18.601 --> 50:21.101
That is why I played on Gundogdu.

50:21.201 --> 50:23.168
To create some space.

50:23.234 --> 50:25.868
You are as clever as him, Kurdoglu.

50:26.634 --> 50:29.434
You could have only
arrange everything like this.

50:29.568 --> 50:30.968
Thank you.

50:33.134 --> 50:36.068
I am just an old man waiting to die.

50:36.934 --> 50:41.434
I would like to share my experiences
with Gundogdu.

50:42.601 --> 50:47.168
So that our tent would not mess up
in the hands of Suleyman and Ertugrul.

51:03.068 --> 51:05.334
Suleyman fell into the trap.

51:05.934 --> 51:08.468
Let us start collecting men immediately.

51:09.234 --> 51:13.068
I will give the gold necessary
to do this to you.

51:21.668 --> 51:24.301
Both you and I will talk to the beys.

51:25.201 --> 51:27.368
Leave the toughest ones to me.

51:28.201 --> 51:29.668
Alright, enjoy it.

51:51.334 --> 51:52.534
Aykiz...

51:54.201 --> 51:55.468
Aykiz...

52:00.901 --> 52:02.234
Aykiz!

52:03.601 --> 52:05.034
Aykiz.

52:09.968 --> 52:11.201
Aykiz!

52:12.434 --> 52:14.468
Aykiz!

52:18.601 --> 52:20.268
Aykiz!

52:22.034 --> 52:24.068
Aykiz!

52:36.968 --> 52:38.301
Turgut...

52:43.501 --> 52:44.868
Turgut...

52:48.534 --> 52:49.934
Tie me up.

52:54.501 --> 52:56.634
-Tie me up!
-Turgut...

52:56.868 --> 52:58.001
Tie me up!

52:58.068 --> 52:59.968
Tie me up and get out of here!

53:00.034 --> 53:02.168
Tie me up and get out of here!

53:16.001 --> 53:17.434
Get out of here.

53:19.534 --> 53:20.668
Get out of here!

53:22.401 --> 53:24.134
Aykiz, get out of here!

53:24.201 --> 53:25.401
Get out of here.

53:31.034 --> 53:32.567
I said get out!

53:46.934 --> 53:48.234
Get out of here!

54:25.901 --> 54:27.068
Drink.

54:28.034 --> 54:29.468
Drink. Enjoy it.

54:30.868 --> 54:32.668
So that you will get well fast.

54:33.234 --> 54:36.301
I need you, boy.

54:41.034 --> 54:42.034
Good.

54:43.001 --> 54:44.001
Good.

55:00.101 --> 55:01.301
Halime!

55:01.501 --> 55:03.034
Aykiz, what is it?

55:03.568 --> 55:07.268
I was thinking I wanted to die
by the hands of my loved one.

55:07.334 --> 55:09.434
My wish was almost coming true.

55:10.634 --> 55:12.401
Here. Have a seat.

55:15.368 --> 55:16.901
What happened?

55:22.034 --> 55:23.368
Take it.

55:31.568 --> 55:33.401
Tell me, what happened?

55:35.268 --> 55:38.201
He tried to strangle and kill me.

55:40.401 --> 55:43.001
But I saw my Turgut in his eyes.

55:43.368 --> 55:47.434
The devil inside him
was gone for a moment.

55:54.268 --> 55:56.101
What if Isadora is right?

55:57.534 --> 56:02.134
What if he is going to die because
he did not have that ominous potion?

56:25.168 --> 56:26.201
How is she, sister?

56:26.268 --> 56:27.501
Better, thankfully.

56:27.601 --> 56:29.968
She will get well after tonight.

56:30.568 --> 56:32.168
Thank you.

56:39.668 --> 56:41.201
Ertugrul...

56:48.001 --> 56:50.301
I knew you would not leave me alone.

56:55.201 --> 56:58.101
You are my lifelong sister, Gokce.

56:59.134 --> 57:00.468
I owe you a life.

57:56.901 --> 57:59.601
I would like you to know
what will happen to you...

57:59.868 --> 58:02.868
...if anybody hears my sister's situation.

58:06.101 --> 58:07.901
Ertugrul Bey is inside.

58:17.068 --> 58:19.968
I am glad you visited
my sister, Ertugrul Bey.

58:21.601 --> 58:24.901
I would be ashamed
as a human being if I did.

58:25.001 --> 58:29.568
I wish you also knew
who loves you and who does not.

58:30.434 --> 58:32.201
To love is not to know.

58:33.168 --> 58:35.001
To love is to feel.

58:35.101 --> 58:36.634
I know whom I feel.

58:37.434 --> 58:39.134
And who loves me.

58:40.268 --> 58:41.901
Have a good day.

58:57.334 --> 59:00.901
Gundogdu, there are
20 beys in the marquee.

59:01.901 --> 59:05.234
Most of them will support you,
but it is not enough.

59:05.334 --> 59:07.301
We must find more support.

59:07.868 --> 59:11.268
You must get in the marquee
with all the beys' support.

59:12.034 --> 59:14.634
Are there any more candidates?

59:14.901 --> 59:17.301
No one will have the courage for it.

59:17.368 --> 59:19.968
The majority wants and supports you.

59:21.434 --> 59:23.868
I keep thinking, uncle...

59:25.134 --> 59:27.568
...why did you not be a candidate?

59:29.234 --> 59:31.568
I never had my eyes on the marquee.

59:32.601 --> 59:38.068
If I did, I would have gotten on that
throne way earlier than your father would.

59:39.501 --> 59:41.368
I want you to be the bey.

59:41.434 --> 59:44.868
You are clever.

59:44.934 --> 59:48.334
You stay out of trouble and you talk.

59:51.634 --> 59:53.434
Now it is time to decide.

00:59:58.101 --> 01:00:03.368
Then, for my tent's and tribe's future...

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.034
...I am a candidate.

01:00:10.934 --> 01:00:12.401
That is my boy!

01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:19.068
Let us set to work, now.

01:01:58.568 --> 01:02:03.134
Maybe we will get out of the marquee,
and the new bey will settle in.

01:02:04.868 --> 01:02:08.234
I am looking forward to see
those peaceful days.

01:02:08.334 --> 01:02:10.334
Everything will be okay.

01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:12.068
Do not worry.

01:02:12.134 --> 01:02:15.068
I am doing the right thing.

01:02:15.134 --> 01:02:17.901
You making the wrong thing
is unheard of.

01:02:19.468 --> 01:02:21.934
-Enjoy it.
-May I come in, father?

01:02:22.534 --> 01:02:24.201
Come in, son.

01:02:26.968 --> 01:02:29.068
Have a seat.

01:02:29.134 --> 01:02:31.668
-Good morning.
-Good morning, son.

01:02:35.634 --> 01:02:37.301
How is your wound?

01:02:37.368 --> 01:02:39.168
Which wound, mother?

01:02:42.134 --> 01:02:43.434
I am good, mother.

01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:44.868
I am good.

01:02:47.401 --> 01:02:51.968
The beys are going
from one tent to another like bees.

01:02:54.034 --> 01:02:56.101
They are making honey, son.

01:02:56.168 --> 01:02:58.901
It is this way since my ancestor Oghuz.

01:03:00.134 --> 01:03:03.334
Oghuz beys are selected
by not the sword, but by words...

01:03:03.401 --> 01:03:09.601
...by not power, but tolerance,
counseling and consensus.

01:03:12.234 --> 01:03:14.634
The people of the tent
talk to the beys...

01:03:14.901 --> 01:03:18.268
...and the beys talk to other beys,
so that they find the correct way.

01:03:18.334 --> 01:03:22.001
It is our duty to obey
this biggest tradition of ours.

01:03:22.934 --> 01:03:26.868
However, I do not know
if it is the right time.

01:03:29.568 --> 01:03:34.001
A Bey's duty is to see the instigation
before it enters the body...

01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:38.168
...and take measures rather than
waiting until it enters the body.

01:03:38.268 --> 01:03:43.001
When the instigation enters the body,
it will be bloody to pull it out.

01:03:43.101 --> 01:03:46.068
So, I took measures
from the very beginning.

01:03:46.134 --> 01:03:50.868
In the end, whoever wins the election...

01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:54.268
...it will be the tent that wins.

01:03:56.034 --> 01:04:01.401
If I could have foreseen it and taken
measures when Selcan's father...

01:04:02.268 --> 01:04:04.934
...betrayed me, we would not have
those painful days.

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:08.401
Take it as an advice from your father.

01:04:09.168 --> 01:04:12.534
When the time comes and
the path to be the bay is seen...

01:04:14.201 --> 01:04:17.568
Will you be a candidate
for the election, Ertugrul?

01:04:19.068 --> 01:04:21.001
What are you saying, mother?

01:04:21.601 --> 01:04:26.334
Do I not tell you all the time
that I am after the hunt, not the seat.

01:04:29.201 --> 01:04:30.468
Did you forget?

01:04:37.301 --> 01:04:39.168
However...

01:04:40.134 --> 01:04:43.301
...if peace does not
come out of this election...

01:04:44.901 --> 01:04:49.268
...I will bring this marquee down
on not only my uncle...

01:04:50.368 --> 01:04:53.001
...but also my elder brother Gundogdu.

01:05:22.188 --> 01:05:23.888
Eykis Hatun...

01:05:23.988 --> 01:05:25.421
Come here.

01:05:29.554 --> 01:05:31.888
What are you hiding from me?

01:05:31.988 --> 01:05:34.788
Why are you turning your eyes away?

01:05:35.188 --> 01:05:37.121
Tell me.

01:05:37.188 --> 01:05:38.854
I cannot, Gokce.

01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:41.454
Why not?

01:05:41.588 --> 01:05:43.121
What are you afraid of?

01:05:45.388 --> 01:05:47.521
I am afraid of your elder sister

01:05:47.588 --> 01:05:50.588
and things she will do
to me if she finds out.

01:05:50.688 --> 01:05:52.388
I beg you, Eykis Hatun.

01:05:53.488 --> 01:05:56.488
I swear on Quran that I
will not tell my sister.

01:05:59.821 --> 01:06:05.154
That bastard Alpargu did
you such a big harm...

01:06:55.821 --> 01:06:59.388
I want to talk to you
before I talk to my father.

01:06:59.488 --> 01:07:02.121
If you are curious about
whether I will be a candidate...

01:07:02.188 --> 01:07:03.988
...you know me, brother.

01:07:04.054 --> 01:07:06.821
Well, I am not so sure about it.

01:07:07.088 --> 01:07:11.788
I have long lost the young man who said
"I am after the hunt, not the seat."

01:07:12.454 --> 01:07:15.554
You have changed a lot since
you went to Aleppo as ambassador

01:07:15.621 --> 01:07:17.888
and your path had crossed
with Halime Sultan.

01:07:19.854 --> 01:07:21.721
I am the same man, brother.

01:07:23.088 --> 01:07:25.621
I am just trying to stand straight.

01:07:26.454 --> 01:07:29.188
Both of us have always
had the same aim.

01:07:29.454 --> 01:07:33.021
Both of us wanted the tent to
be stronger and more peaceful.

01:07:34.388 --> 01:07:36.088
We had the same aim.

01:07:36.454 --> 01:07:40.188
We did. However, you wanted
to go beyond the mountains.

01:07:40.454 --> 01:07:43.021
Whereas you wanted to
go through the plains.

01:07:43.088 --> 01:07:46.554
These decisions of yours
have caused us so much pain.

01:07:46.654 --> 01:07:48.154
We lost a lot of lives.

01:07:48.654 --> 01:07:51.188
Now my father sees this as well.

01:07:51.454 --> 01:07:54.054
The road leads to truth.

01:07:55.188 --> 01:07:58.088
No matter you pass through the
mountains, the snow or the avalanche.

01:07:58.154 --> 01:08:00.588
The true eye sees the justice.

01:08:01.988 --> 01:08:04.654
And a true man stays humble.

01:08:05.854 --> 01:08:09.721
If one looks from higher
ground, he may be mistaken

01:08:10.988 --> 01:08:13.454
If you are curious
about what I have become...

01:08:13.588 --> 01:08:16.488
...I have not lost my mind
wandering the mountains.

01:08:16.588 --> 01:08:19.521
I am still the same
Ertugrul you have known.

01:08:19.621 --> 01:08:23.621
I would not oppose neither my
father nor my elder brother.

01:08:24.488 --> 01:08:27.754
Shame on me if I speak
against them. Take my word it.

01:08:27.821 --> 01:08:30.088
You have a big mouth, Ertugrul!

01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:43.521
At least, I speak out
my own words, brother.

01:08:43.588 --> 01:08:45.554
What do you mean?

01:08:48.021 --> 01:08:51.621
The characteristics of a bey of
Kayi is to talk with his own mouth.

01:08:52.521 --> 01:08:55.088
A bey who lets in his wife's greed instead
of her support and his uncle's lies...

01:08:55.188 --> 01:08:59.821
...instead of his support
into the marquee is no good, Gundogdu.

01:09:29.388 --> 01:09:32.688
Although it is not easy, there is still
time for you to find the true path...

01:09:32.788 --> 01:09:36.788
...and to see justice
by being humble,brother.

01:10:36.088 --> 01:10:38.554
I brought hot soup for you my sister.

01:10:46.021 --> 01:10:50.954
You don’t care at all if I become
Ertugrul's wife or not, do you?

01:10:51.788 --> 01:10:52.788
What?

01:10:52.854 --> 01:10:55.454
It was all a game, wasn’t it?

01:10:55.521 --> 01:11:00.788
Just to become the Hanim of the tent and
to be able to do what my father could not.

01:11:02.154 --> 01:11:04.854
Gokce, what are you saying?

01:11:05.888 --> 01:11:09.388
You are just a selfish
and two-faced woman.

01:11:11.588 --> 01:11:13.821
I do not want to see you anymore.

01:11:14.821 --> 01:11:15.821
Go away.

01:11:15.888 --> 01:11:18.888
-What are you saying, girl?
-I know very well what I am saying.

01:11:18.954 --> 01:11:21.588
I don’t want to see you anymore. Go!

01:11:21.654 --> 01:11:23.088
-Gokce...
-Go!

01:11:23.454 --> 01:11:25.088
-Gokce...
-Get out of here!

01:11:26.654 --> 01:11:28.187
I said get out!

01:11:30.788 --> 01:11:31.988
Out!

01:11:33.021 --> 01:11:34.654
Out!

01:11:58.021 --> 01:11:59.588
Halime...

01:12:00.654 --> 01:12:03.888
Your horse Sultan is ready for a ride.

01:13:29.854 --> 01:13:32.621
I will talk to my father
after the election.

01:13:32.721 --> 01:13:34.754
This issue must come to an end..

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.154
What if he insists on his will?

01:13:43.121 --> 01:13:48.821
Then it is my duty to take you
and Yigit and leave the tent.

01:13:50.921 --> 01:13:52.721
Did you think thoroughly?

01:13:54.688 --> 01:13:58.088
What would I do if you be
unhappy after you leave your tent?

01:13:58.954 --> 01:14:01.454
What would I do without
you Sultan Halime?

01:14:05.521 --> 01:14:07.688
The tent means everything to you.

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:12.654
And you are this tent's future.

01:14:14.688 --> 01:14:17.421
You will be this tent's
bey in the future.

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:21.821
This is the truth although
you don’t accept it.

01:14:21.888 --> 01:14:24.854
Halime Sultan, what are you saying?

01:14:24.921 --> 01:14:28.521
I only say what everybody
sees and knows but you.

01:14:29.454 --> 01:14:33.788
I say what people know
but are scared to vocalize.

01:14:38.654 --> 01:14:40.554
What does your heart say?

01:14:42.554 --> 01:14:44.788
To run away with you.

01:14:48.154 --> 01:14:50.988
A peaceful life far from everything.

01:14:53.521 --> 01:14:57.021
But even if you left the tent,
the tent wouldn’t leave you.

01:14:57.121 --> 01:14:59.454
Because Kayis are your fate...

01:15:01.421 --> 01:15:03.621
...and you are Kayis' fate.

01:15:56.421 --> 01:15:59.788
An Alp's duty is not only
to protect the tent...

01:15:59.854 --> 01:16:01.954
...but also to go to war for God.

01:16:02.021 --> 01:16:05.154
But for this, the tent
must be strong inside.

01:16:05.854 --> 01:16:09.054
If an Alp keeps worrying for
the tent when he is away at war...

01:16:09.121 --> 01:16:11.154
...the nonbelievers
sword will be sharper.

01:16:11.388 --> 01:16:12.821
How can that be, Kurdoglu?

01:16:12.888 --> 01:16:17.021
Alps shouldn’t go
around helping others.

01:16:17.621 --> 01:16:21.521
Shahzade, Sultan Alaeddin, Ayyubids...

01:16:21.754 --> 01:16:23.054
...we can’t help everyone.

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:24.821
The Bey should think of this first.

01:16:24.954 --> 01:16:27.454
How many lives have we
lost since last summer?

01:16:27.521 --> 01:16:30.521
How many widows and
orphans have we left behind?

01:16:30.654 --> 01:16:34.488
We need a bey who watches
the tent's benefits first.

01:16:35.954 --> 01:16:37.821
And that bey is Gundogdu.

01:16:37.888 --> 01:16:39.654
-Yes.
-That is right.

01:16:39.754 --> 01:16:41.121
Kurdoglu is right.

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:43.621
What is this old one talking about?

01:16:44.454 --> 01:16:48.721
I used admire Kurdoglu when I was a
little boy because his sword was sharp.

01:16:48.788 --> 01:16:51.521
But his tongue turned out
to be sharper than his sword.

01:16:51.621 --> 01:16:54.888
He is done with poisoning
Beys now he’s after the Alps.

01:16:55.388 --> 01:16:57.754
When did he appear in our tent?

01:16:57.854 --> 01:17:01.121
We lost 15 lives when Gundogdu Bey's
caravan was ambushed.

01:17:01.388 --> 01:17:05.554
We lost five Alps when Ertugrul Bey
went with Halime Sultan.

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:07.521
And many more. Why?

01:17:07.588 --> 01:17:11.188
It was the father and son's fault.
None of these might have happened.

01:17:11.454 --> 01:17:14.088
Right. It was all their fault.

01:17:14.154 --> 01:17:18.521
These would not have happened
if Gundogdu Bey were in charge.

01:17:18.688 --> 01:17:20.054
Now, brother...

01:17:21.854 --> 01:17:27.054
Your only mistake is not coming
out of your mothers as snakes!

01:17:48.888 --> 01:17:50.954
Go, I will catch up with you.

01:17:52.188 --> 01:17:54.921
What are you going to do?

01:17:58.388 --> 01:17:59.388
What are you doing?

01:18:02.154 --> 01:18:05.021
Does a brother draw a
sword to his brother?

01:18:14.688 --> 01:18:16.554
Bamsi attacked us
with no reason, Bey.

01:18:16.621 --> 01:18:19.988
Was it not you who talked
behind our Bey's back?

01:18:20.054 --> 01:18:21.521
Alright, enough.

01:18:22.088 --> 01:18:23.788
Enough.

01:18:36.488 --> 01:18:37.954
Good day, niece.

01:18:38.021 --> 01:18:41.188
There would be no good
when you’re around Kurdoglu.

01:19:04.554 --> 01:19:09.054
Keep your sinister tongue in your
mouth and do not cross the line.

01:19:11.821 --> 01:19:14.388
You lured my brother to your side.

01:19:14.488 --> 01:19:17.154
You put my father in
the place you wanted.

01:19:17.421 --> 01:19:20.788
And now you are in a hurry
to get to where you want.

01:19:21.188 --> 01:19:23.621
You will stumble and fall, Kurdoglu.

01:19:24.621 --> 01:19:28.621
And I will be the stone that hits
your foot, the rust in your sheath

01:19:29.021 --> 01:19:31.454
...and the wound on your tongue.

01:19:31.521 --> 01:19:34.988
If you try to attack
me through the Alps...

01:19:35.054 --> 01:19:39.921
...I will forget that you are my uncle and
bring the pole of the tent down on you.

01:20:01.121 --> 01:20:02.954
Children...

01:20:03.021 --> 01:20:05.621
My daughters with shiny eyes.

01:20:05.688 --> 01:20:10.654
My brave sons who will be the
great men of my tent in the future.

01:20:12.388 --> 01:20:17.554
Tonight we will talk
about Oghuz Khan's story.

01:20:17.654 --> 01:20:23.121
The bravest man in the world.
The greatest khan of all.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:29.454
Centuries and centuries ago...

01:20:29.554 --> 01:20:34.521
...that is, years and years
and years and years ago...

01:20:35.421 --> 01:20:40.121
...when we, the Turks still
lived in Otugen uplands...

01:20:41.121 --> 01:20:46.688
...a ray of light shone in Ay Sultan's
eyes who is the mother of all of us.

01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:50.921
And her labor pain started.

01:20:52.121 --> 01:20:55.621
Then, a brave man
came into the world.

01:20:57.888 --> 01:21:01.121
This child's face was
as bright as the sky...

01:21:01.388 --> 01:21:04.388
...and his mouth was as red as fire.

01:21:04.454 --> 01:21:08.021
His eyes were hazel, and
his eyebrows were black.

01:21:11.388 --> 01:21:14.154
His beauty soon became legendary.

01:21:15.088 --> 01:21:19.854
This child just sucked milk from his
mother once, and never wanted anymore.

01:21:21.388 --> 01:21:24.921
He ate raw meat and drank mare milk.

01:21:26.054 --> 01:21:29.754
He grew up and started
to talk in just 40 days.

01:21:30.821 --> 01:21:35.021
He walked, played and traced.

01:21:37.454 --> 01:21:40.921
His waist was the waist of a wolf,
his shoulders were the...

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:43.154
...shoulders of an otter
his feet was the feet of an ox...

01:21:43.421 --> 01:21:45.754
...his chest was the chest of a bear.

01:21:47.688 --> 01:21:52.988
He would herd horses,
ride horse and go hunting.

01:21:53.721 --> 01:21:56.754
After many days and nights...

01:21:56.854 --> 01:22:00.054
...he became an Alp who gave
hope to his allies...

01:22:00.121 --> 01:22:03.388
...and spread fear to his enemies.

01:22:04.888 --> 01:22:07.621
He swung his sword to many enemies.

01:22:07.688 --> 01:22:09.954
He was the hope of the underdog.

01:22:10.021 --> 01:22:13.854
He clothed so many naked man,
and fed so many hungry people.

01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:16.654
After a very long time...

01:22:17.088 --> 01:22:20.554
...his fame was spread
all over the world.

01:22:20.988 --> 01:22:26.954
One day he prayed to the
one and only Creator...

01:22:29.154 --> 01:22:31.088
"Where is my woman?"

01:22:34.421 --> 01:22:36.954
Suddenly it got dark everywhere!

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:43.654
Then, a light brighter than
the Moon came down to Earth.

01:22:46.854 --> 01:22:51.788
And a very beautiful girl appeared.

01:22:52.154 --> 01:22:55.688
The blue skies smiled
when the girl smiled...

01:22:55.754 --> 01:22:59.988
...and when she cried
the blue sky cried.

01:23:00.421 --> 01:23:03.721
Oghuz Khan fell in
love with that girl.

01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.421
And married her.

01:23:10.054 --> 01:23:12.021
They had three children.

01:23:14.021 --> 01:23:17.554
Day, Moon and Star.

01:23:18.388 --> 01:23:21.754
Years and years passed.

01:23:21.821 --> 01:23:25.688
Oghuz Khan was still
working for his tribe.

01:23:26.688 --> 01:23:31.088
He got rich. He had
more weapons and horses.

01:23:31.921 --> 01:23:34.588
One day, he went hunting.

01:23:34.654 --> 01:23:37.488
He saw a tree in
the middle of a lake.

01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:40.388
There was a hollow in the tree.

01:23:40.454 --> 01:23:44.421
And there was an outstanding
beauty in the hollow.

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:48.188
Her eyes were more
beautiful than the lake.

01:23:48.454 --> 01:23:50.821
Her hairs wavy like a stream.

01:23:50.988 --> 01:23:54.021
Her teeth like pearls.

01:23:54.088 --> 01:23:58.621
When Oghuz Khan saw
her, he married her.

01:23:59.421 --> 01:24:01.954
They had three more children.

01:24:02.021 --> 01:24:05.454
Sky, Mountain and Sea.

01:24:08.188 --> 01:24:11.388
Day, Moon and Star were one arm...

01:24:11.454 --> 01:24:15.754
...and Sky, Mountain
and Sea were another arm.

01:24:17.588 --> 01:24:22.621
One day, Oghuz Khan arranged a
feast and called his children.

01:24:23.754 --> 01:24:29.088
"My sons, this world needs one ruler.

01:24:29.788 --> 01:24:33.121
And this man must come
from Oghuz generation."

01:24:33.921 --> 01:24:38.021
He said, "The world must be yours."

01:24:38.654 --> 01:24:45.488
"Extend the golden bow of our
tribe from sunset to sunrise.

01:24:45.554 --> 01:24:47.821
Let me whisper the divine news...

01:24:47.954 --> 01:24:53.821
...to more streams, to
more seas and to more earth.

01:24:54.954 --> 01:24:56.588
What happened then?

01:24:58.488 --> 01:25:00.054
What happened then?

01:25:01.721 --> 01:25:06.754
Oghuz Khan's children were
divided into 24 tribes...

01:25:07.721 --> 01:25:10.854
...and spread all over the world.

01:25:11.821 --> 01:25:15.388
They whispered the divine news...

01:25:15.888 --> 01:25:19.654
...to more seas and to more streams.

01:25:21.154 --> 01:25:23.588
They swung their sword to the tyrant.

01:25:24.554 --> 01:25:26.488
They stood by the the underdog.

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:32.721
So, children, your
grandfathers ruled the world.

01:25:34.521 --> 01:25:38.588
No, we will either resurrect
like our ancestors...

01:25:42.021 --> 01:25:43.954
...or we will be destroyed.

01:25:46.688 --> 01:25:48.888
So, children...

01:25:48.954 --> 01:25:51.721
...we need to resurrect.

01:25:51.821 --> 01:25:54.988
Resurrect.

01:25:55.821 --> 01:25:59.954
It is up to you...

01:26:00.888 --> 01:26:05.988
...to take the bottom
line of today's story.

01:26:07.488 --> 01:26:08.721
Up to you.

01:26:16.921 --> 01:26:18.488
Ertugrul and his Alps...

01:26:18.588 --> 01:26:22.521
...brought the tent to the brink
of a disaster before the election.

01:26:22.588 --> 01:26:24.988
What do you think Ertugrul is up to?

01:26:26.388 --> 01:26:29.921
He must have wanted to show the power
of his weapon before the election.

01:26:29.988 --> 01:26:33.088
He may also be a
candidate in the election.

01:26:34.654 --> 01:26:36.554
Let’s eat, enjoy it.

01:26:38.721 --> 01:26:41.688
-Who will support Ertugrul?
-Who else but..

01:26:41.754 --> 01:26:43.954
Mad Demril and his men.

01:26:44.054 --> 01:26:46.588
I would not expect such
a thing from Ertugrul.

01:26:46.688 --> 01:26:51.421
Tell Hamza Alp to gather whoever can
use a sword in front of the marquee.

01:26:52.954 --> 01:26:54.421
You are right.

01:26:55.388 --> 01:26:57.088
Hamza!

01:26:58.021 --> 01:26:59.388
Hamza!

01:27:02.388 --> 01:27:04.688
-Yes, Bey.
-Gather your Alps up.

01:27:04.788 --> 01:27:07.021
Tell them to be ready
tomorrow for the feast.

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:10.654
Do not show mercy if
anything goes wrong.

01:27:10.988 --> 01:27:12.488
Yes, Bey.

01:27:15.054 --> 01:27:18.188
Come on, uncle. Here. Enjoy it.

01:27:18.421 --> 01:27:19.954
Thank you, Gundogdu.

01:27:27.654 --> 01:27:29.388
It is delicious, sister.

01:28:06.954 --> 01:28:12.054
God, do not test us with
a burden we cannot carry.

01:28:14.054 --> 01:28:17.554
Do not let us forget you
after you grant us power.

01:28:18.721 --> 01:28:24.621
Do not let us fight for fame,
or break hearts with arrogance.

01:28:26.088 --> 01:28:29.854
God, there is something
I wish from you.

01:28:30.554 --> 01:28:34.921
Let me be a servant who
lives only for your blessing.

01:28:36.154 --> 01:28:43.154
God, please do not take my tent's,
my tribe's, my family's peace away.

01:28:44.788 --> 01:28:47.988
And do not let the ones
who want to do it succeed.

01:28:48.821 --> 01:28:49.988
Amen.

01:30:18.754 --> 01:30:20.788
This is the big day, Gundogdu.

01:30:22.121 --> 01:30:24.888
This is the day you rise
above Kayis like the Sun...

01:30:24.954 --> 01:30:27.121
And the day that
darkness will go away.

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:29.554
It is all because of you.

01:30:30.388 --> 01:30:33.554
You did not want an election
because he is your father...

01:30:33.654 --> 01:30:36.654
...but our people want
to see you as the bey.

01:30:36.788 --> 01:30:40.621
Your father gave this opportunity
to you with his own hands.

01:30:42.121 --> 01:30:47.621
Do you think it is right for me to against
my father when he is also a candidate?

01:30:52.854 --> 01:30:55.054
You will not go against your father.

01:30:55.121 --> 01:30:58.688
You will go against the beys
and request what you deserve.

01:30:59.088 --> 01:31:03.588
Your father knew that Ertugrul would have
to pay for the things he had done.

01:31:03.688 --> 01:31:07.788
Obviously, he wanted to be
cautious before it is too late.

01:31:07.854 --> 01:31:12.188
If he still wants to be the
bey, it is his responsibility.

01:31:42.954 --> 01:31:44.488
Ertugrul Bey...

01:31:45.054 --> 01:31:46.488
Halime Sultan?

01:31:48.921 --> 01:31:52.688
Your sadness is reflected
on your face. What is it?

01:31:53.688 --> 01:31:57.388
I heard that you and Kurdoglu
went against each other.

01:31:59.054 --> 01:32:01.788
I am worried about
you and our future.

01:32:02.821 --> 01:32:04.188
Why?

01:32:05.121 --> 01:32:09.854
We have been running away for years.
It is all because of that damn throne.

01:32:10.588 --> 01:32:14.554
Neither my father would have died
nor we would suffer that much...

01:32:14.621 --> 01:32:16.421
...if it were not for it.

01:32:17.921 --> 01:32:23.654
If you will be enemies with Gundogdu Bey
just because of that, please do not.

01:32:25.521 --> 01:32:27.454
Do not be in that fight.

01:32:29.788 --> 01:32:31.788
Leave the world to them.

01:32:33.521 --> 01:32:35.721
Our love is enough for both of us.

01:32:38.121 --> 01:32:39.721
My gazelle-eyed lover.

01:32:39.788 --> 01:32:41.721
Do not worry.

01:32:41.788 --> 01:32:48.521
This man will not behold anything
other than God's blessing.

01:33:10.521 --> 01:33:12.421
Today the truth will reveal.

01:33:14.754 --> 01:33:16.921
-Is everything set, Karabudak?
-Everything is set.

01:33:16.988 --> 01:33:18.854
We gave gold to those beys.

01:33:19.088 --> 01:33:21.421
We talked to everyone.
It is all set, Bey.

01:33:22.688 --> 01:33:27.188
We will see Gundogdu Bey
as the new bey.

01:33:30.454 --> 01:33:31.888
My brave niece!

01:33:32.654 --> 01:33:36.654
The tents will see a real bey
after you come to the throne.

01:33:36.721 --> 01:33:38.154
Thank you, uncle.

01:33:38.654 --> 01:33:39.754
Are the men ready?

01:33:39.821 --> 01:33:41.088
Everybody is ready.

01:33:41.188 --> 01:33:44.454
If anybody makes a scene,
he will be punished.

01:33:45.554 --> 01:33:49.488
-I will never forget your support on this.
-Thank you niece.

01:33:51.988 --> 01:33:57.121
You will see how it is like to be
overthrown by your own son, Suleyman Shah.

01:34:22.521 --> 01:34:24.554
Shall we go in?

01:35:37.621 --> 01:35:40.821
By the 99 names of
God the Almighty...

01:35:40.888 --> 01:35:45.588
...who fills our hearts with
blessings and who rules the world.

01:35:50.754 --> 01:35:52.888
The great men of my tribe...

01:35:53.788 --> 01:35:58.654
Peace be open our prophet.

01:36:07.654 --> 01:36:14.188
God bless Turks' great ancestors
from Oghuz Khan to today.

01:36:14.521 --> 01:36:16.054
Amen!

01:36:16.154 --> 01:36:17.788
May they rest in peace.

01:36:17.854 --> 01:36:19.154
Amen!

01:36:19.954 --> 01:36:25.888
May our martyrs, our
great ancestors...

01:36:26.521 --> 01:36:27.988
...and elders bless us.

01:36:28.054 --> 01:36:29.454
Amen!

01:36:29.521 --> 01:36:32.954
May our mothers, our sisters...

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:38.788
...our brave warriors
always be on the true path.

01:36:39.088 --> 01:36:41.488
Amen!

01:36:41.954 --> 01:36:44.388
This is the head council.

01:36:45.121 --> 01:36:49.854
May this council
always express justice.

01:36:51.488 --> 01:36:54.621
And make decisions freely.

01:36:54.988 --> 01:37:00.488
We believe that no soul
is superior to another.

01:37:02.988 --> 01:37:08.188
A shepherd and a
sultan is equal to us.

01:37:09.621 --> 01:37:13.788
Everyone in this council
will give his decision freely.

01:37:13.888 --> 01:37:16.521
Therefore, I abdicate the throne...

01:37:16.587 --> 01:37:18.388
...until the election end.

01:37:18.454 --> 01:37:20.054
-What?
-How can this happen?

01:37:38.121 --> 01:37:40.054
I am also in the election.

01:37:41.688 --> 01:37:44.087
The decision is yours.

01:38:02.688 --> 01:38:08.854
Beys! It is time for
our tent to elect a Bey.

01:38:11.121 --> 01:38:16.688
If there is anybody who wants
to be a candidate or name one...

01:38:18.554 --> 01:38:20.788
...he should speak now.

01:38:20.854 --> 01:38:23.988
I there’s anyone else
above our Suleyman Shah.

01:38:58.688 --> 01:39:01.721
I hope Ertugrul Bey does not
put himself into trouble.

01:39:01.788 --> 01:39:05.388
Do not worry. He is a clever man.

01:39:07.621 --> 01:39:10.921
But I have not seen a day like
this for years in the tent.

01:39:12.021 --> 01:39:14.621
Let us see who our new bey will be.

01:39:15.088 --> 01:39:18.421
Do you still not know
who our new bey will be?

01:39:22.621 --> 01:39:24.021
Do you?

01:39:24.688 --> 01:39:27.388
I married him because I had known.

01:39:58.921 --> 01:40:02.721
Our candidate is... Gundogdu!

01:40:41.454 --> 01:40:44.654
I am not a candidate.

01:40:59.421 --> 01:41:01.888
While Suleyman Shah
is still the Bey...

01:41:01.954 --> 01:41:04.588
...I don’t qualify for it..

01:41:37.054 --> 01:41:40.688
Kurdoglu thinks I do not
see the games he is playing.

01:41:40.888 --> 01:41:43.621
He does what he can to
create trouble in the tent.

01:41:43.688 --> 01:41:46.854
Son, he will play mostly on you.

01:41:47.421 --> 01:41:50.688
My request from you is
to do whatever he says.

01:41:50.754 --> 01:41:54.554
We can only break Kurdoglu's games
by using his games against him.

01:41:54.621 --> 01:41:57.754
I show mercy to him because
he is my blood brother.

01:41:57.821 --> 01:41:59.188
I want him to find the true path.

01:41:59.454 --> 01:42:02.021
Now, you will cooperate
with him and rebel against me.

01:42:02.088 --> 01:42:05.588
And you will announce that you
are a candidate to be a bey.

01:42:05.654 --> 01:42:07.688
And then you will
renounce in the election.

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:08.821
Of course, father.

01:42:08.888 --> 01:42:11.088
Your words are my orders.

01:42:29.088 --> 01:42:31.688
Now that my niece broke his promise...

01:42:35.555 --> 01:42:36.988
...I am the candidate.

01:43:02.788 --> 01:43:04.555
Beys...

01:43:04.655 --> 01:43:07.455
...in this case...

01:43:07.555 --> 01:43:11.621
...who says
our Bey is Suleyman Shah?

01:43:15.688 --> 01:43:19.655
-Yes, Suleyman Shah.
-It is Suleyman Shah.

01:43:20.721 --> 01:43:24.455
-Suleyman Shah.
-Yes, Suleyman Shah.

01:44:30.055 --> 01:44:34.621
Our Bey, the leader of our marquee...

01:44:35.888 --> 01:44:39.821
...is Suleyman Shah
by unanimous decision!

01:44:57.155 --> 01:45:01.155
Long live, Suleyman Shah!

01:45:04.621 --> 01:45:06.088
Long live, Suleyman Shah.

01:45:06.155 --> 01:45:09.688
-Long live!
-God bless you!

01:45:11.021 --> 01:45:13.955
Long live...

01:45:21.788 --> 01:45:24.388
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

01:45:27.555 --> 01:45:29.555
My God...

01:45:35.355 --> 01:45:36.688
My flag...

01:45:44.688 --> 01:45:47.788
My weapon...

01:45:48.055 --> 01:45:49.621
I swear on them.

01:45:52.055 --> 01:45:55.655
I will give and take life...

01:45:58.421 --> 01:46:00.888
...for the sake of my people's faith...

01:46:01.688 --> 01:46:04.588
...in order for the justice to be made.

01:46:04.688 --> 01:46:07.921
If I fail, let my sword
be drenched in my blood.

01:46:09.355 --> 01:46:13.788
I will always feed the hungry,
and clothe the naked.

01:46:15.021 --> 01:46:19.521
From sunrise to sunset...

01:46:20.855 --> 01:46:24.788
...I will struggle
for the world dominance.

01:46:26.121 --> 01:46:28.755
I will carry the holy news...

01:46:28.855 --> 01:46:35.555
...to more seas,
more streams and more lands.

01:46:37.488 --> 01:46:40.155
I will fight for the holy words...

01:46:40.421 --> 01:46:43.788
...for the sake of world order.

01:46:45.955 --> 01:46:49.121
May God be our helper.

01:46:49.355 --> 01:46:51.488
Amen!

01:47:00.555 --> 01:47:02.621
My book is my witness.

01:47:13.821 --> 01:47:15.788
My flag is my witness.

01:47:27.921 --> 01:47:29.688
My weapon is my witness.

01:47:40.521 --> 01:47:42.521
God bless your duty, Bey.

01:47:45.121 --> 01:47:46.755
Thank you, Wild Demir.

01:47:50.388 --> 01:47:51.888
God bless your duty, Bey.

01:48:03.021 --> 01:48:05.088
God bless your duty, Bey.

01:48:26.355 --> 01:48:29.488
I was worried
you were going against my father.

01:48:29.955 --> 01:48:33.521
There are so many games in this path.

01:48:33.588 --> 01:48:37.721
Sometimes you win the fight
with these games, rather than weapons.

01:48:41.821 --> 01:48:44.388
God bless you, Bey.

01:48:48.888 --> 01:48:50.988
My brave son.

01:48:51.088 --> 01:48:54.155
May God give you
a good generation of children.

01:48:58.521 --> 01:49:00.688
I wish you a long time duty, Bey.

01:49:04.021 --> 01:49:07.121
May you always win victories, son.

01:49:07.388 --> 01:49:10.588
May God give you
a good generation of children.

01:49:32.655 --> 01:49:36.688
Long live Suleyman Shah!

01:49:37.055 --> 01:49:41.921
Long live Suleyman Shah!

01:49:50.421 --> 01:49:54.721
Long live Suleyman Shah!

01:50:07.488 --> 01:50:09.655
I am your Bey again.

01:50:19.088 --> 01:50:21.721
Let us take our bows and shields

01:50:21.788 --> 01:50:24.421
May this be a sign for us

01:50:24.488 --> 01:50:27.355
May the grizzly wolf be the guide for us

01:50:27.455 --> 01:50:29.555
May we be blessed with our hunts

01:50:29.655 --> 01:50:33.721
May we have more seas,
more streams and more lands

01:50:34.521 --> 01:50:38.121
May the Sun be our flag
Under the blue skies

01:50:38.788 --> 01:50:42.921
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

01:50:43.488 --> 01:50:47.888
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

01:50:49.055 --> 01:50:53.955
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

01:51:00.988 --> 01:51:02.588
God bless this for all of us.

01:51:02.655 --> 01:51:03.955
Amen!

01:51:39.455 --> 01:51:42.021
I will make your life miserable,
Gundogdu.

01:51:42.088 --> 01:51:44.055
So, you played a game against me!

01:51:44.121 --> 01:51:47.488
I will make your life miserable!

01:52:15.021 --> 01:52:18.921
You collaborated with your father
and tarnished your name.

01:52:27.455 --> 01:52:30.755
I collaborated with my father
and I nipped in the bud, Selcan.

01:52:30.821 --> 01:52:33.721
Oh, Gundogdu...

01:52:33.788 --> 01:52:37.988
You failed the beys who trusted
and started this journey with you.

01:52:38.088 --> 01:52:42.888
Nobody in this tent
will follow you from now on!

01:52:42.955 --> 01:52:44.388
Selcan!

01:52:47.455 --> 01:52:50.788
As long as my father is alive...

01:52:51.455 --> 01:52:55.055
...this tent's bey and leader is him.

01:52:56.655 --> 01:53:00.721
You and this tent's people
should know this very clearly!

01:53:01.588 --> 01:53:04.655
You are neither a man nor a bey!

01:53:04.721 --> 01:53:06.655
-Easy!
-Shame on you!

01:53:06.755 --> 01:53:08.755
-Do not cross the line, woman!
-It is enough!

01:53:08.821 --> 01:53:10.988
Shame on me
to take you to my bed as a man!

01:53:36.555 --> 01:53:38.655
They sent these
from the rug shop, mother.

01:53:38.721 --> 01:53:42.621
-These are the lastly weaved fabrics.
-Alright, my girl.

01:53:44.055 --> 01:53:45.655
May I come in, Mother Hayme?

01:53:45.721 --> 01:53:47.121
Come in, Gundogdu.

01:53:52.521 --> 01:53:53.855
Leave us alone.

01:54:03.721 --> 01:54:05.121
What is it, son?

01:54:08.121 --> 01:54:10.388
Mother Hayme...

01:54:10.488 --> 01:54:13.888
...I want you
to find me a woman as soon as possible.

01:54:19.155 --> 01:54:20.921
Are you sure?

01:54:21.688 --> 01:54:23.855
There will be no way back.

01:54:25.421 --> 01:54:27.088
I am, mother.

01:54:27.155 --> 01:54:29.588
I want it as soon as possible.

01:54:50.021 --> 01:54:51.855
What is going on, Kurdoglu?

01:54:53.421 --> 01:54:55.855
Are you leaving just because you lost?

01:54:57.121 --> 01:55:00.388
I do not expect
anything from the tent, anymore.

01:55:01.421 --> 01:55:04.721
Your coward husband
disgraced me in front of everybody.

01:55:05.721 --> 01:55:08.755
I am through with everything now.

01:55:08.855 --> 01:55:11.821
I am devastated, too.

01:55:11.921 --> 01:55:15.821
Suleyman's children turned out to be
dishonorable like himself.

01:55:18.855 --> 01:55:21.755
I know how to keep myself off of them...

01:55:22.455 --> 01:55:25.788
...but I do not know
what you are going to do.

01:55:25.888 --> 01:55:27.488
May God help you.

01:55:32.688 --> 01:55:34.155
Thank you.

01:55:44.555 --> 01:55:46.688
Gokce? My girl, wait...

01:55:46.788 --> 01:55:48.521
Wait...

01:55:50.421 --> 01:55:53.621
You are wounded.
You are in so much pain.

01:55:56.788 --> 01:55:59.421
You saved my son's life
with these hands.

01:56:01.088 --> 01:56:03.155
You gave life to our family.

01:56:03.388 --> 01:56:04.921
God bless you.

01:56:08.888 --> 01:56:13.955
I gave my life to Ertugrul Bey,
whom I love more than my own life.

01:56:17.988 --> 01:56:19.855
But father...

01:56:21.488 --> 01:56:24.821
...I do not want to
listen to you anymore.

01:56:28.121 --> 01:56:30.688
If I do...

01:56:32.688 --> 01:56:36.455
...I deserve Ertugrul
whom I love more than my own life...

01:56:36.521 --> 01:56:40.521
...and cause you
who brought me and my sister up...

01:56:40.588 --> 01:56:45.621
...and Mother Hayme pain,
and a big lie to myself.

01:56:46.388 --> 01:56:48.655
-Gokce...
-Forgive me, father.

01:56:48.721 --> 01:56:49.921
My girl?

01:56:49.988 --> 01:56:52.988
Ertugrul...

01:56:54.421 --> 01:56:58.921
...is my elder brother from now on.

01:57:01.055 --> 01:57:02.955
I made a mistake.

01:57:04.021 --> 01:57:06.388
He found the owner of his heart.

01:57:09.088 --> 01:57:10.954
If you permit...

01:57:12.954 --> 01:57:16.355
...I want Ertugrul to be happy.

01:57:54.121 --> 01:57:57.988
You could not overthrow
Suleyman Shah again, Kurdoglu.

01:57:59.855 --> 01:58:01.555
I made Gundogdu a candidate.

01:58:01.621 --> 01:58:03.888
I talked to all of the beys one by one.

01:58:03.955 --> 01:58:06.555
I said I would drive a wedge
between the father and the sons.

01:58:06.655 --> 01:58:08.455
But Gundogdu sold me out.

01:58:09.121 --> 01:58:11.388
Do not be upset.

01:58:11.755 --> 01:58:14.655
We know how difficult it is.

01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:17.721
No tricks or lies from now on.

01:58:18.455 --> 01:58:21.821
It is time to let the weapons talk.
There is no other choice.

01:58:22.688 --> 01:58:25.855
First, hunt your enemies one by one.

01:58:26.788 --> 01:58:29.988
Do not let your anger
to lure you into a trap.

01:58:30.955 --> 01:58:33.721
What would we do without Kurdoglu?

01:58:34.521 --> 01:58:36.021
Do you have any advice?

01:58:36.688 --> 01:58:38.921
Finish Gundogdu first.

01:58:40.088 --> 01:58:44.788
You must show the whole tent
what happens to a man who sells you out.

01:58:48.355 --> 01:58:52.155
We defeated so many enemies
with this poison.

01:58:57.755 --> 01:59:00.955
And do not forget
to bring the young shahzade to me.

01:59:01.721 --> 01:59:03.688
I will never forget this.

01:59:04.921 --> 01:59:08.588
The young shahzade
will be in your hands as soon as possible.

01:59:54.455 --> 01:59:57.921
Being not to be able
to do anything is killing me.

02:00:01.088 --> 02:00:03.655
What if Ibn al-Arabi does not come?

02:00:04.621 --> 02:00:08.021
What if something happens
to my brother Turgut until then?

02:00:08.088 --> 02:00:11.355
How can we get ahead of God's will,
brother Bamsi?

02:00:12.688 --> 02:00:16.121
Let us pray that
Ibn al-Arabi comes as soon as possible.

02:00:18.621 --> 02:00:19.855
Water...

02:00:21.921 --> 02:00:23.488
Water...

02:00:23.555 --> 02:00:24.688
He said "water".

02:00:24.788 --> 02:00:26.121
He said "water".

02:00:29.121 --> 02:00:30.721
I am here, brother.

02:00:35.988 --> 02:00:38.455
Water, brother. Drink it.

02:00:53.421 --> 02:00:54.755
Bamsi...

02:00:56.721 --> 02:00:59.155
He said "Bamsi". Did you hear?

02:00:59.388 --> 02:01:00.555
He said "Bamsi"!

02:01:00.655 --> 02:01:02.821
Drink it, brother! Drink it!

02:01:02.955 --> 02:01:04.121
Drink water, brother!

02:01:06.088 --> 02:01:08.021
He said "Bamsi". He said my name!

02:01:08.088 --> 02:01:12.521
Thank you, God.
You made me so happy.

02:01:13.755 --> 02:01:15.155
My brother...

02:01:34.688 --> 02:01:36.121
I had promised you.

02:01:37.688 --> 02:01:39.521
And now I am keeping it.

02:01:48.355 --> 02:01:50.521
Who is my father's murderer?

02:01:50.588 --> 02:01:54.955
If you listen to me carefully,
you will take our father's revenge.

02:01:57.521 --> 02:01:59.488
I am listening to you.

02:01:59.921 --> 02:02:01.655
Who is my father's murderer?

02:02:05.955 --> 02:02:07.821
Afsin Bey.

02:02:08.455 --> 02:02:09.721
You are lying.

02:02:11.355 --> 02:02:14.055
I will tell you how you can find him...

02:02:14.155 --> 02:02:16.588
...and you will go and ask him yourself.

02:02:16.655 --> 02:02:18.121
The rest is up to you.

02:02:19.021 --> 02:02:21.455
Believe it or not.

02:03:04.755 --> 02:03:07.488
What is it, Yigit? What is wrong with you?

02:03:10.555 --> 02:03:13.121
You do not talk. You seem sad.

02:03:14.921 --> 02:03:16.388
I am good, sister.

02:03:16.488 --> 02:03:17.955
I am very good.

02:03:21.488 --> 02:03:23.055
Halime Sultan.

02:03:23.788 --> 02:03:26.921
Suleyman Shah is waiting for you
in his marquee.

02:03:57.621 --> 02:03:59.488
You wanted to see me, Bey?

02:04:00.921 --> 02:04:02.421
Come here.

02:04:08.588 --> 02:04:12.121
Pour this into Gundogdu's water.

02:04:26.888 --> 02:04:28.588
Consider it done, Bey.

02:04:37.988 --> 02:04:41.421
You will see what it means
to play with Kurdoglu.

02:05:00.355 --> 02:05:02.388
Your father wanted to see me.

02:05:04.155 --> 02:05:06.088
He wanted me, as well.

02:05:07.155 --> 02:05:08.921
I hope nothing is wrong.

02:05:34.521 --> 02:05:36.388
You wanted to see us, Bey?

02:05:39.155 --> 02:05:40.621
Have a seat.

02:05:47.121 --> 02:05:50.455
There is something I want to talk about.

02:05:51.921 --> 02:05:53.588
I talked to Gokce.

02:05:57.021 --> 02:05:59.721
Gokce said...

02:06:01.888 --> 02:06:05.021
..."Ertugrul is my elder brother
from now on.

02:06:09.788 --> 02:06:11.655
I made a mistake.

02:06:12.588 --> 02:06:14.655
He found the owner of his heart.

02:06:16.488 --> 02:06:20.021
If you permit, father,
I would like my brother...

02:06:20.088 --> 02:06:24.588
...to marry Halime Sultan and be happy."

02:06:31.155 --> 02:06:32.621
Mother?

02:06:33.955 --> 02:06:36.055
May God make you two happy.

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:38.421
Along with your children.

02:06:48.988 --> 02:06:52.421
May God make you happy.
I wish you a happy marriage.

02:06:53.355 --> 02:06:54.521
Amen, father.

02:07:00.855 --> 02:07:02.455
Be happy, my girl.

02:07:57.621 --> 02:07:59.555
May I come in, Gundogdu Bey?

02:08:32.721 --> 02:08:33.955
Wait!

02:08:37.621 --> 02:08:38.921
What are you doing here?

02:08:38.988 --> 02:08:42.021
Selcan Hatun sent goods
from the rug shop.

02:08:43.888 --> 02:08:45.155
Alright, then.

02:09:02.488 --> 02:09:04.655
Take me to Afsin Bey.

02:09:04.721 --> 02:09:06.388
Of course, Shahzade.

02:09:08.155 --> 02:09:10.521
Alper, is everything ready?

02:09:10.588 --> 02:09:11.621
It is, Bey.

02:09:11.721 --> 02:09:15.821
Good. Shahzade...

02:09:16.055 --> 02:09:18.055
...these Alps will escort you.

02:09:19.755 --> 02:09:22.955
I would like you
to punish Afsin Bey the way he deserves.

02:09:23.021 --> 02:09:25.155
Everybody will pay for what they did.

02:10:22.455 --> 02:10:24.388
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

02:11:39.855 --> 02:11:40.988
Gundogdu!

02:11:41.588 --> 02:11:43.088
Gundogdu!

02:11:43.155 --> 02:11:45.555
Gundogdu! Help me!

02:11:45.921 --> 02:11:47.121
Gundogdu!

02:11:47.388 --> 02:11:49.455
Gundogdu!

02:11:49.788 --> 02:11:51.955
Help! Help me!

02:11:59.055 --> 02:12:01.721
Gundogdu! Help!

02:12:04.421 --> 02:12:07.888
Help me!

02:12:30.921 --> 02:12:32.421
Is Afsin Bey coming here?

02:12:32.488 --> 02:12:33.988
Yes, Shahzade.

02:12:35.788 --> 02:12:37.421
Where is he, then?

02:12:44.921 --> 02:12:48.388
The dagger does not look good
in your hand, Shahzade.

02:13:04.421 --> 02:13:05.955
Help me!

02:13:06.888 --> 02:13:09.888
Help me!

02:13:24.121 --> 02:13:26.555
We are together, at last.

02:13:26.655 --> 02:13:28.121
Yes, gazelle eyes.

02:13:29.455 --> 02:13:31.688
Shahzade Yigit will be very happy.

02:13:49.921 --> 02:13:52.355
What is going on? Let go of me!

02:13:52.421 --> 02:13:53.555
Bastards!

02:13:53.888 --> 02:13:55.555
I will make you two pay!

02:13:55.621 --> 02:13:58.055
I will make all of you pay! Traitors!

02:13:58.155 --> 02:13:59.655
Let go of me!

02:14:02.555 --> 02:14:03.555
Let go of me!
