Episode 17 will start after 12:15 min

12:15.197 --> 12:18.197
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:19.074 --> 12:22.074
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:23.154 --> 12:26.154
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:52.907 --> 13:54.540
Do you want to kill me?

14:02.107 --> 14:03.174
Do it.

14:05.440 --> 14:09.607
Do it. Otherwise
accept that I am your brother.

14:12.107 --> 14:13.474
Brother?

14:14.307 --> 14:15.940
<i>Brother.</i>

14:20.540 --> 14:21.907
<i>Kill him!</i>

14:32.474 --> 14:35.574
Drink this. You will feel better.

14:39.074 --> 14:42.974
Kneel if you want your magic water.

16:08.574 --> 16:10.174
Turgut!

16:10.240 --> 16:12.240
Bey! Turgut!

16:12.307 --> 16:14.474
Pigs!

16:16.340 --> 16:17.907
Bastards!

16:19.240 --> 16:21.540
How could you do this
to my brothers?

16:28.007 --> 16:29.307
He is alive.

16:32.274 --> 16:34.574
Thankfully, brother Turgut is alive!

16:34.640 --> 16:36.874
We must take them to the tent.

16:38.507 --> 16:40.607
Ertugrul is seriously wounded.

16:44.907 --> 16:48.574
The Crusaders' sword cannot cut him.
There must be a reason.

16:50.407 --> 16:53.374
Brother, there is blood
on all over Turgut's body!

16:53.440 --> 16:55.340
But he does not have a wound!

16:55.407 --> 16:57.407
-Take a look!
-Move aside!

17:02.040 --> 17:04.607
Bey, how could they do this to you?

17:05.074 --> 17:07.207
Bey! I will take your revenge!

17:07.307 --> 17:10.174
I will pull their lungs out
and feed vultures with them.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.074
He lost blood. Take this off!

17:12.140 --> 17:13.440
Take it off.

17:17.607 --> 17:21.007
Where did these bastards hit?
I cannot find your wound!

17:21.107 --> 17:24.474
Brother! God, keep me sane.

17:24.907 --> 17:26.607
Where are these villains?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.540
Brother Turgut...

17:56.640 --> 17:58.474
Are you alright, brother?

18:02.307 --> 18:04.874
Did you do this to Ertugrul Bey?

18:50.674 --> 18:53.007
Brother Turgut!

18:53.507 --> 18:58.607
I was not devastated this much even when
the Mongols killed my family.

18:59.207 --> 19:01.474
Say that you did not do it!

19:01.540 --> 19:02.940
Brother Turgut!

19:07.107 --> 19:08.674
Turgut!

19:10.073 --> 19:14.540
I will hurt you so much that
nobody will scream like that!

19:15.040 --> 19:17.007
Turgut!

19:21.474 --> 19:22.540
Turgut!

19:32.307 --> 19:36.940
God, do not take my live
before I take these bastards' lives!

19:41.907 --> 19:43.274
Turgut!

20:02.074 --> 20:03.574
Kill all of them!

20:05.374 --> 20:07.140
Attack!

20:32.940 --> 20:34.240
Judas!

21:02.440 --> 21:03.940
Turgut!

22:56.407 --> 22:57.640
Ertugrul.

22:59.607 --> 23:02.540
My brother.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.400
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.433
We are the messengers of
Alaeddin Keykubat...

24:12.533 --> 24:14.433
...the ruler of the Great Seljuk State.

24:14.533 --> 24:17.200
We want to see your Bey
Suleyman Shah.

24:17.300 --> 24:21.600
Welcome. Welcome to our lands.
We will let Suleyman Shah know.

24:21.700 --> 24:22.966
Thank you.

24:53.666 --> 24:57.233
You should keep the loops tighter,
or it will break up.

24:57.300 --> 25:00.666
And keep your dye solid
if you want a neat pattern.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.500
Go on with your smiling face.

25:04.566 --> 25:06.700
They will get spoiled in no time.

25:06.933 --> 25:08.900
Sisters...

25:10.533 --> 25:14.366
You listen to Sister Gokce,
right, Selcan?

25:15.200 --> 25:18.133
Go away, Kurdoglu!

25:23.633 --> 25:25.200
Where is Gundogdu?

25:25.466 --> 25:28.533
They went to find customers
for the flock.

25:28.633 --> 25:30.100
Are you sure?

25:31.133 --> 25:33.300
They made a deal with Tatos Harput.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.966
I hope he is not up to something
behind our backs.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.066
What on earth is this?

25:43.166 --> 25:44.666
Who are these man?

25:51.900 --> 25:55.000
The Seljuk commander Ersogun Bey.

25:55.066 --> 25:58.400
The storm is near if he came here.

26:00.033 --> 26:03.233
His father died, but his sister
is still troubling us.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.166
Let us see how this ends.

26:06.266 --> 26:09.366
If we have one more trouble
because of her...

26:09.633 --> 26:11.900
You will do what you did to Liva?

26:12.400 --> 26:15.400
Halime must not die
as easily as that women did.

26:53.233 --> 26:56.633
Bey, Sultan Alaeddin Keykubat's messenger
would like to see you.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.266
Bring him in.

27:04.466 --> 27:06.633
Suleyman Shah is waiting for you.

27:17.033 --> 27:19.466
-Your weapon.
-No need for that.

27:23.700 --> 27:26.300
Welcome, brother.
Welcome to our land.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.966
Thank you, Suleyman Shah.

27:32.033 --> 27:34.066
Thankfully, we are
seeing each other again.

27:34.133 --> 27:37.066
Thankfully.
Come here, brother. Please.

27:50.533 --> 27:53.700
I see that both the tent
and you are very well, Suleyman Shah.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.300
Thankfully.

27:56.366 --> 27:59.466
We overcame a lot of troubles.
Thankfully.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.533
I know all of them.

28:01.633 --> 28:05.000
One of these troubles
was from the shahzades.

28:06.233 --> 28:09.300
We know very well
the problem with Kara Toygar.

28:11.666 --> 28:14.966
Kara Toygar caused so much trouble,
Ersegun Bey.

28:15.033 --> 28:18.533
I hope Sultan Allaaddin will not
send another Kara Toygar...

28:18.633 --> 28:20.966
...for the young shahzade.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.300
Well, well, well.

28:23.366 --> 28:26.233
Kurdoglu, the brave warrior
of the battlefields.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.633
Your mouth is as sharp as your sword.

28:28.900 --> 28:31.200
This matter is finished for our Sultan.

28:31.266 --> 28:35.566
Especially after he found out about
what Ertugrul Bey did in Aleppo.

28:35.966 --> 28:40.300
Ertugrul Bey protected the Islamic world
from a big war.

28:40.433 --> 28:44.400
Everybody in Konya talks about
how a big hero Ertugrul Bey is.

28:48.433 --> 28:52.500
Sultan Alaeddin would not
send you here for no reason.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.166
I hope nothing is wrong.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.166
It is a state secret, Kurdoglu.

28:56.233 --> 28:59.233
I cannot say anyone
other than Suleyman Shah.

28:59.933 --> 29:03.066
Unless he sees fit.

29:07.700 --> 29:09.966
Let us talk alone, Kurdoglu.

29:44.166 --> 29:49.199
Nobody can even milk a cow in this tent
without Kurdoglu's permission, Suleyman.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.300
I will make you realize this, too.

29:55.166 --> 29:58.033
What is the matter that is so important?

29:58.133 --> 30:01.900
Suleyman Shah, the Islamic world
has hard times ahead.

30:03.266 --> 30:07.166
The fierce breath of the Mongol thugs
started to cause pain in Anatolia.

30:07.233 --> 30:08.900
We must stop this monster.

30:08.966 --> 30:12.933
Otherwise, they will destroy
everywhere they pass through.

30:14.366 --> 30:18.566
Nobody knows their banditry
more than we do.

30:20.100 --> 30:22.933
The Mongols caused great distress to us...

30:23.000 --> 30:28.100
...when our unity and welfare
broke down with factions .

30:28.933 --> 30:31.366
Sultan Alaeddin
seeks for alliance because of that.

30:31.433 --> 30:32.433
How so?

30:32.500 --> 30:35.400
An alliance with the Ayyubids,
Suleyman Shah.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.100
Thank God for all this.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.900
That was what we needed,
Ersagun Bey.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.500
Unity and solidarity.

30:45.600 --> 30:50.933
Your young son Ertugrul paved the way
for Sultan Alaeddin for this.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.600
He sent both you and your son
his regards.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.600
And some presents, if you accept.

30:59.966 --> 31:01.533
Let them bring them in.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.933
Soldiers! Bring them in!

31:20.633 --> 31:23.266
Tell him I say thank you.

31:34.400 --> 31:38.566
The seal for this alliance
will be a marriage.

31:38.700 --> 31:42.933
Sultan Alaeddin wants to marry
the Damascene Queen Adilliye.

31:43.633 --> 31:46.500
This is very accurate politics.

31:46.566 --> 31:50.466
He gave the duty
to ask for the girl's hand to me.

31:51.333 --> 31:55.033
The train that is brought for the wedding
waits in Aleppo.

31:56.033 --> 31:58.133
What does he want from us?

31:58.266 --> 32:02.966
Sultan wants help from Ertugrul Bey
and his Alps for the train to be set up.

32:03.333 --> 32:08.066
And then, to come together with you and
your son to have a meal and talk.

32:08.166 --> 32:11.433
I am honored by the Sultan's
request and invitation.

32:12.366 --> 32:17.466
Ertugrul is on the way. I will send him
with you when he comes back.

32:18.233 --> 32:20.133
Thank you, Suleyman Shah.

32:20.533 --> 32:22.433
There is one more matter.

32:22.533 --> 32:23.900
What is it?

32:24.966 --> 32:27.066
Halime Sultan and Shahzade Yigit.

32:28.366 --> 32:31.533
We were informed that
they stay in your tent.

32:37.466 --> 32:41.000
The tent foamed up
like Euphrates's water again.

32:41.066 --> 32:43.066
You have to find out what is going on.

32:43.133 --> 32:46.433
If the Seljuk Sultan
sent a messenger to the tent...

32:46.566 --> 32:50.333
...and shared a state secret,
it is clearly not good news.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.233
Of course it is not.

32:53.300 --> 32:57.000
Ertugrul is a hero now
for both the Seljuk and Aleppo.

32:58.033 --> 33:00.233
The train in front of the door
is for presents.

33:00.300 --> 33:03.900
Those generous presents
are for Ertugrul and his father.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
While I prepare the tent's beys
for the seigniory of Gundogdu...

33:08.266 --> 33:10.066
...you watch your girl.

33:10.133 --> 33:13.133
Do not let her ally with his father
and go against me.

33:13.233 --> 33:17.666
Do not worry. I will spoil every game
Suleyman Shah makes with Ertugrul.

33:19.566 --> 33:21.100
Good.

33:31.566 --> 33:35.000
They will come after me
like they did for my father.

33:35.133 --> 33:37.900
Either to kill or to use.

33:39.166 --> 33:41.200
Our father does not even have a tomb.

33:41.300 --> 33:44.233
We cannot even go this tomb
and pray for him.

33:45.366 --> 33:48.633
Do you think it will end
different for me, sister?

33:49.533 --> 33:52.333
Ertugrul Bey
will protect you from everything.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.133
Do not worry like this.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.133
He does not even care if I die or not.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.533
I will not let you suffer for me anymore.

34:03.666 --> 34:05.666
It is enough.

34:13.066 --> 34:15.333
You always suffered
since the day I was born.

34:15.400 --> 34:19.500
You have been my sister,
my mother, my shoulder to cry on.

34:21.066 --> 34:25.666
There should not be any more suffering.
You should be happy, too.

34:25.900 --> 34:30.033
Let me go. I cannot live
between Ertugrul and you like an ulcer.

34:31.033 --> 34:33.166
Yigit, what are you saying?

34:34.966 --> 34:37.500
I will not let you two suffer.

34:37.633 --> 34:39.300
Yigit...

35:13.933 --> 35:15.366
Welcome, Halime Sultan.

35:15.633 --> 35:17.433
Thank you, Sister Gokce.

35:19.433 --> 35:21.100
I am sorry for your father.

35:21.166 --> 35:22.900
God forgive his sins.

35:25.366 --> 35:27.633
However, your brother...

35:27.700 --> 35:30.533
He is also a shahzade.

35:30.633 --> 35:34.066
We are worried about new troubles
that might come.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.400
The Seljuk messenger...

35:37.500 --> 35:41.500
I hope he is not the foreshadow
of new troubles.

35:48.466 --> 35:50.966
Suleyman Shah waits for you
in the pavilion.

35:51.033 --> 35:53.466
Speak of the devil...

36:02.066 --> 36:04.166
The Seljuks are after me.

36:04.633 --> 36:07.133
I will not stay here anymore.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.900
They will leave my sister
and Ertugrul alone.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.566
You can go to hell.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.966
Ersagun, Sultan Alaeddin's messenger.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.266
I brought you Sultan Alaeddin's regards.

36:47.033 --> 36:51.366
Sultan is worried about
you and your brother's health.

36:51.433 --> 36:56.133
Whenever he worries about our health,
it means trouble for us.

36:57.033 --> 37:01.933
Sultan loves and respects you
because you are a noble Seljuk princess.

37:03.133 --> 37:08.466
He made a mansion prepared
for your brother in Kayseri.

37:09.066 --> 37:10.566
You will have servants.

37:10.633 --> 37:14.100
They will do what is necessary
for our shahzade's education.

37:14.166 --> 37:17.500
He wishes you to marry an emeer
and be happy.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.600
If you see fit, of course.

37:23.333 --> 37:26.933
I will think about the Sultan's offer
about my brother.

37:27.366 --> 37:28.700
As to me...

37:30.300 --> 37:33.500
...I plotted a different route
for me and my heart.

37:37.066 --> 37:42.000
I want to spend the rest of my life
as this tent's daughter if they see fit.

37:45.333 --> 37:49.066
Pass my regards
to my uncle Sultan Alaeddin.

37:55.500 --> 37:56.633
Excuse me.

38:09.033 --> 38:12.033
It is strange
that she wants to stay in your tent.

38:12.133 --> 38:16.166
She has to be aware of the values
that have been granted to her.

38:20.933 --> 38:24.466
You are a very brace child,
as your name suggests.

38:24.566 --> 38:29.366
You will be Alps with Dundar
when he gets up.

38:31.200 --> 38:36.066
When that time comes,
I will make your swords with my hands.

38:36.133 --> 38:38.933
So, do not upset your sister, alright?

38:40.433 --> 38:46.633
Also, just like he is the tent's girl,
you are the tent's brave man.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.400
Sister?

38:58.466 --> 39:00.000
Yigit...

39:00.066 --> 39:02.133
What does the Sultan want from us?

39:03.933 --> 39:08.166
Do not worry, Yigit.
He is not our enemy anymore.

39:08.533 --> 39:12.433
See, Yigit?
That trouble has been overcome now.

39:15.433 --> 39:18.666
After my father payed for it?

39:56.566 --> 39:58.133
Ertugrul!

40:08.233 --> 40:09.600
Akcakoca!

40:11.333 --> 40:12.700
Akcakoca!

40:14.533 --> 40:15.533
Hamza!

40:15.600 --> 40:17.233
Hamza!

40:20.033 --> 40:21.133
Ertugrul!

40:21.200 --> 40:22.500
Hamza!

40:24.200 --> 40:26.900
-Where is Akcakoca?
-Went up the mountain, Bey.

40:29.900 --> 40:32.700
Let us carry him.
I will put firebrand on it.

40:33.133 --> 40:35.166
Come on, come on!
Faster! Come on!

40:38.000 --> 40:39.266
Yes, Bismillah!

40:42.500 --> 40:44.666
Turgut?

40:45.900 --> 40:47.433
Where is my Turgut?

40:49.266 --> 40:50.700
Where is my Turgut?

41:13.966 --> 41:15.900
-Bey may I come in?
-Come in.

41:19.966 --> 41:21.266
What is going on?

41:21.966 --> 41:23.133
They arrived, Bey.

41:23.700 --> 41:25.466
Are my children alright?

41:26.066 --> 41:29.400
Dogan, Bamsi and Afsin Bey
are wounded, Halime Ana.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.933
And Ertugrul Bey...

41:33.033 --> 41:35.166
-...is seriously wounded.
-What?

41:37.466 --> 41:39.500
Halime!

41:51.000 --> 41:52.233
Ertugrul!

41:53.533 --> 41:54.966
Ertugrul.

41:57.033 --> 41:58.466
How is he, Gundogdu Bey?

41:58.533 --> 42:00.200
Not good at all, Sister Halime.

42:00.266 --> 42:01.600
Not good at all.

42:03.200 --> 42:05.333
Wild Demir, should we find Arabi?

42:05.433 --> 42:07.233
I will let him know, Bey.

42:10.033 --> 42:11.600
What happened, Dogan?

42:11.700 --> 42:15.500
Bamsi? What happened?
Where is Turgut?

42:15.566 --> 42:18.566
If anybody says that traitor's name
in this tent anymore...

42:18.633 --> 42:20.966
...I will cut their tongue off!

42:21.366 --> 42:23.200
Bamsi, what are you saying?

42:23.266 --> 42:25.533
Do you hear what you say?

42:26.566 --> 42:29.633
It was not the Crusaders
who put us in this situation.

42:29.700 --> 42:31.966
It was your bastard husband.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.300
He betrayed us.

42:35.300 --> 42:39.200
You are lying! Turgut would never do that!

42:39.533 --> 42:41.133
Lie!

42:53.333 --> 42:54.900
Women out.

43:10.900 --> 43:13.366
Help us, Shafi!

43:24.966 --> 43:28.700
Gundogdu got me disappointed
whenever I got high hopes for him.

43:29.533 --> 43:32.133
He brought his brother behind my back.

43:32.500 --> 43:36.466
I should have known when Abdurrahman
brought news from Ertugrul.

43:36.533 --> 43:41.000
He came as a trouble
when he was supposed to come dead.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.366
Do not worry, Bey.

43:43.433 --> 43:46.966
He will pay when the time comes.

45:09.666 --> 45:11.600
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

46:23.533 --> 46:27.000
My Turgut would give is life
for Ertugrul Bey.

46:27.966 --> 46:30.366
How can this be, Halime Sultan?

46:32.166 --> 46:36.433
You knew them.
They were so close.

46:37.900 --> 46:39.400
How can this be?

46:41.933 --> 46:44.700
Please tell me there is a catch to it.

46:46.400 --> 46:48.000
I do not now, Aykiz.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.600
But that castle is like hell.

46:54.033 --> 46:56.200
You pray every day to die.

46:58.200 --> 47:00.600
God, give my Ertugrul back to me.

47:01.133 --> 47:03.366
Do not leave me without him.

47:08.600 --> 47:13.133
Turgut would never do this to Ertugrul
even if they cut him into pieces.

47:15.033 --> 47:17.266
What am I going to do now?

47:19.266 --> 47:21.900
Aykiz, it is okay.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.366
God...

47:27.466 --> 47:29.233
Aykiz, it is okay.

47:41.200 --> 47:42.933
Cry, my dear sister.

47:44.100 --> 47:45.900
This is our fate.

47:50.533 --> 47:53.600
I have been missing him for years
even when I was with him.

47:53.666 --> 47:55.500
My beautiful sister.

47:57.900 --> 48:02.900
Somebody showed up
the moment I thought I had him.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.566
And now the Angel of Death
wants to take him.

48:10.933 --> 48:13.100
Where there is life, there is hope.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.000
Do not torture yourself.

48:18.566 --> 48:21.600
If fate takes him from me...

48:22.533 --> 48:25.266
...I will be in deep sorrow.

48:25.366 --> 48:27.333
I will be devastated.

48:33.633 --> 48:37.600
If I lose him, too after my father...

48:40.466 --> 48:42.666
...every breath will mean death to me.

48:42.900 --> 48:47.966
Do not do this, Gokce.
His brother Gundogdu saved him.

48:49.233 --> 48:52.033
Now Arabi seeks cure for him.

48:52.133 --> 48:55.433
There is nothing to do for us
other than praying.

48:59.533 --> 49:01.266
Sister...

49:03.066 --> 49:05.166
I cannot breathe without him.

49:43.933 --> 49:45.366
Ertugrul!

49:45.433 --> 49:46.500
Ertugrul!

49:46.600 --> 49:48.666
Ibn al-Arabi is by his side.

49:48.900 --> 49:51.233
Do not worry, he is in safe hands.

49:54.233 --> 49:56.266
If anything happens to him...

49:57.466 --> 49:59.366
...how can I live, Bey?

50:02.000 --> 50:03.433
Be strong.

50:05.300 --> 50:09.233
You the mother of not only
your children, but also the tent.

50:11.066 --> 50:13.133
If you be devastated...

50:13.200 --> 50:15.900
...how can I order
my young Alps to die?

50:18.133 --> 50:20.600
I have a heart the size of a fist.

50:21.300 --> 50:24.633
Strength, but how much longer, Bey?

50:28.533 --> 50:30.066
I am going to his tent.

50:30.166 --> 50:31.533
I will wait there.

51:10.300 --> 51:14.033
Father, how are we going to
show our face to our people?

51:15.900 --> 51:18.633
What if Turgut chose the wrong way
as they say?

51:18.700 --> 51:21.033
How can we stay in this tent?

51:21.100 --> 51:23.200
If they are telling the truth...

51:23.266 --> 51:27.300
...it is my duty to hang Turgut's head
in the middle of the tent.

51:32.100 --> 51:34.300
I loved him like he was my own son.

51:37.133 --> 51:41.100
These are not the things
he would do, though.

51:45.200 --> 51:48.500
We will stand upright and be patient.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.200
Do you understand?

52:28.333 --> 52:33.966
<i>Let me give you good news, woman</i>

52:35.566 --> 52:42.566
<i>May your brave man not fall down</i>

52:45.266 --> 52:50.133
<i>May your shadowy big tree</i>

52:50.233 --> 52:53.333
<i>Not be cut down</i>

52:54.700 --> 52:59.466
<i>May your glorious water</i>
 <i>That runs like blood</i>

52:59.566 --> 53:04.000
<i>Not dry up</i>

53:04.433 --> 53:08.633
<i>May the tips of your wings</i>

53:09.200 --> 53:13.033
<i>Not break</i>

53:13.966 --> 53:18.466
<i>May Al-Qadr not let you lean on</i>

53:18.600 --> 53:21.400
<i>The despicable</i>

53:25.533 --> 53:27.500
Did Turgut do this?

53:42.033 --> 53:48.266
I remembered the day Ertugrul found you
in the woods and brought here.

53:55.166 --> 53:57.266
You were so hungry that...

53:57.366 --> 54:02.566
...you ate the partridge he hunted raw.

54:06.466 --> 54:09.400
I cherished you like my own sons.

54:15.566 --> 54:17.300
Why?

54:19.333 --> 54:20.933
Why?

54:21.566 --> 54:25.266
You did not let us be in sorrow
for not having a mother.

54:27.533 --> 54:31.033
But he...

54:34.366 --> 54:37.933
I will make him pay in both worlds.

54:39.633 --> 54:41.100
He will be punished.

55:28.533 --> 55:30.633
The bishop to E-4.

55:53.300 --> 55:57.099
One of my Cardinal friends
has told me once:

55:58.366 --> 56:03.099
"Baphomet is the god that
the Templars worship to.

56:03.166 --> 56:04.566
They deceive people.

56:04.633 --> 56:08.433
Black magic and
all kinds of mischief come from them.

56:08.500 --> 56:13.433
The satirical goats of
Sabbath witches guide them.

56:24.233 --> 56:27.933
The ones who cannot defeat us
with their own strength...

56:29.066 --> 56:33.200
...cannot bring us down
with various defamations, Thomas.

56:35.466 --> 56:38.933
I only knew one person
who defeated you with his own strength.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.633
And it is Ertugrul.

56:43.633 --> 56:46.333
Your temple will not have
any value to me...

56:46.400 --> 56:51.200
...as long as Ertugrul lives,
my dear friend Petruchio.

56:57.900 --> 57:00.266
Cardinal, his majesty...

57:01.200 --> 57:02.900
...are you alright?

57:03.966 --> 57:06.466
I have had better days, Eftelya.

57:23.100 --> 57:28.700
You must read this demon's letter
to the Pope at all costs.

57:31.666 --> 57:35.266
What will we do
if he wrote something bad about us?

57:36.233 --> 57:42.633
It would be good to kill him before
the Council of the Templars gather up.

57:45.233 --> 57:46.600
Yes, sir.

58:12.400 --> 58:17.433
How did those damned Templars
tempt Turgut Alp?

58:19.200 --> 58:22.200
They are the sneakiest enemy
we ever had.

58:22.966 --> 58:26.033
They will not come to the battlefield.

58:26.133 --> 58:32.266
They either lay an ambush
or sneak in disguise.

58:34.933 --> 58:37.300
We are talking,
but what is the remedy, Bey?

58:37.366 --> 58:40.900
How many more soldiers we will loose
and cry after them?

58:41.266 --> 58:45.600
We have to stop this mischief
spreading from this castle.

58:47.366 --> 58:49.600
Their mischief reach our tent...

58:49.900 --> 58:55.066
...even when they are
beyond the Ayyubid border.

58:55.333 --> 58:58.166
It has to be stopped, but how?

58:59.033 --> 59:00.700
We must bring their castle
down on them.

59:00.933 --> 59:02.400
Is this remedy, Bey?

59:02.466 --> 59:06.600
Are we going to spend all our lives
with our swords put on?

59:07.466 --> 59:10.066
They are sneaky, we are brave.

59:10.133 --> 59:13.366
They are the winners, we are the losers.
Is that so?

59:13.466 --> 59:15.200
There must be another way.

59:15.266 --> 59:17.366
Yes, there must be another way.

59:17.433 --> 59:19.966
Our people does not want war, Bey.

59:26.166 --> 59:28.333
We are the Alps of the battlefields, Bey.

59:28.400 --> 59:30.033
We cannot bring a castle down.

59:30.100 --> 59:34.333
We have neither appropriate equipment
nor training for this.

59:34.433 --> 59:37.233
Getting angry and making mistakes
would be unacceptable.

59:37.300 --> 59:40.066
Karabudak is right.

59:40.166 --> 59:42.300
We cannot bring that castle down.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.566
However, we can hit them
with their own tricks.

59:47.300 --> 59:49.233
How is it going to be, Gundogdu?

59:49.333 --> 59:53.233
How are we going to manage to be
as vile and sneaky as them?

01:00:11.333 --> 01:00:14.033
His body is as strong as his heart.

01:00:14.133 --> 01:00:15.566
He did not give up.

01:00:40.433 --> 01:00:42.100
Halime...

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.200
Halime...

01:00:51.633 --> 01:00:53.566
I am here, Ertugrul.

01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:03.266
Let us not tire him much.

01:01:07.566 --> 01:01:11.400
Alright, girls.
I will stay by Ertugrul's side.

01:01:11.966 --> 01:01:13.400
You go back to work.

01:01:13.466 --> 01:01:15.233
Come on, do not stay here.

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.200
Come on.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.466
Ertugrul Bey is awake, Bey.

01:01:39.566 --> 01:01:40.566
He is alright.

01:01:40.666 --> 01:01:42.100
Thank God.

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:44.066
Thank God.

01:01:58.033 --> 01:02:00.933
We do not have to be
sneaky and vile, Kurdoglu.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.500
A little courage and a little intelligence
would be enough.

01:02:05.233 --> 01:02:07.533
And of course, faith.

01:02:07.633 --> 01:02:10.533
If one of them is lacking...

01:02:10.633 --> 01:02:13.333
...it means that
this is not a tent anymore.

01:02:14.566 --> 01:02:17.000
Thankfully, we have faith, Bey.

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:19.900
Our bodies and hearts are strong.

01:02:19.966 --> 01:02:23.900
We respect Gundogdu's intelligence
who has a Bey's qualities.

01:02:24.633 --> 01:02:26.066
Let us listen to him.

01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:29.400
Listen, so that
we would broaden our horizons.

01:02:33.266 --> 01:02:34.533
Thank you, uncle.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.533
Thank you.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:42.466
I say let us make these Templars come down
to the plains from the mountains.

01:02:42.566 --> 01:02:46.233
Otherwise, we cannot even
budge the door of their castle.

01:02:47.033 --> 01:02:48.600
The Templars are everywhere.

01:02:48.666 --> 01:02:50.266
Like mosquitos.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.666
If we do not bring their castle
down on them...

01:02:54.966 --> 01:02:57.333
...if we do not drain that swamp...

01:02:57.433 --> 01:03:00.900
...it will not matter
if we kill all the mosquitos.

01:03:02.233 --> 01:03:07.500
I say, we must make
the Seljuks and the Ayyubids ally.

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:14.900
If we do this, we can bring that castle
down on them with their help.

01:03:16.066 --> 01:03:20.566
And when we do this,
our attack becomes a victory.

01:03:22.133 --> 01:03:24.300
Gundogdu Bey is right, Bey.

01:03:26.066 --> 01:03:28.333
Two heads are better than one, Bey.

01:03:29.266 --> 01:03:31.966
This brave man is telling the truth.

01:03:32.366 --> 01:03:35.100
Kurdoglu turned out to be right
as usual.

01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:38.700
Gundogdu, who talked about
Aleppo once...

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.066
...found our cure again.

01:03:41.633 --> 01:03:45.066
He guided us
with his intelligence and valor.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.100
Thank you, Karabudak.

01:04:39.097 --> 01:04:40.930
Gundogdu...

01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:42.697
...attacked us with his Alps.

01:04:42.764 --> 01:04:44.597
And Ertugrul?

01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:46.864
He was breathing.

01:04:47.164 --> 01:04:51.364
We will not have peace
as long as that Turk breathes.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.530
I will find out what is going on
from Kurdoglu.

01:04:54.597 --> 01:04:56.697
We will talk in the morning.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.664
I was worried about you.

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:37.864
Here I came.

01:05:39.364 --> 01:05:40.797
Welcome, Turgut.

01:05:44.164 --> 01:05:46.364
I am sorry, I said it by mistake.

01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:47.930
"Judas".

01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:52.530
Did you succeed?

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.397
He was lying there in a pool of blood.

01:05:58.564 --> 01:06:00.830
He and his friends.

01:06:02.164 --> 01:06:04.530
But he was still breathing.

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:13.097
My duty will not finish
as long as Ertugrul lives.

01:06:37.364 --> 01:06:39.464
If you take this medicine this much...

01:06:39.564 --> 01:06:42.164
...you will have nightmares
while awake.

01:06:43.364 --> 01:06:45.597
And then die in the worst way.

01:07:01.664 --> 01:07:02.930
Isadora...

01:07:04.497 --> 01:07:06.530
My beautiful princess.

01:07:07.464 --> 01:07:08.864
You are too inquisitive.

01:07:10.097 --> 01:07:13.964
This is not a good thing
for such a lady like you at all.

01:07:51.397 --> 01:07:52.697
Bey...

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:59.597
I would like to escort
Alaeddin's dowry train if you see fit.

01:08:02.964 --> 01:08:06.464
Father, I intend to enjoy
the best of both worlds.

01:08:07.164 --> 01:08:08.430
How?

01:08:08.497 --> 01:08:11.630
We will certainly gain
Sultan Alaeddins's respect.

01:08:11.697 --> 01:08:14.497
But the most important thing
is the Templars.

01:08:15.097 --> 01:08:20.397
It is clear that the Templars
will want to prevent this marriage.

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:23.497
-They will probably ambush the train.
-Meaning?

01:08:23.564 --> 01:08:27.497
Meaning, the hunter becomes the hunted.

01:08:28.397 --> 01:08:32.097
It is a very good opportunity
to both put them in their place...

01:08:32.164 --> 01:08:34.997
...and increase our tribe's reputation.

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:40.530
So, I would like to escort the train
if you see fit.

01:09:00.664 --> 01:09:02.530
Alright.

01:09:06.564 --> 01:09:08.397
God help you.

01:09:08.464 --> 01:09:09.697
Amen.

01:09:10.530 --> 01:09:12.064
Thank you, Bey.

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:25.397
Mother Hayme.

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:27.897
Come in, my girl.

01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:38.530
Mother Hayme...

01:09:39.397 --> 01:09:41.730
You are very tired. Have some rest.

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:45.030
I can sit by Ertugrul's side.

01:09:48.597 --> 01:09:50.664
Do not leave Dundar alone.

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:55.730
It is so hard to be a mother, Halime.

01:09:59.764 --> 01:10:05.097
You will understand
when you have children one day.

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:11.397
Whenever a thorn pricks their foot...

01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:15.564
...your heart turns into a fire ground.

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.730
I am leaving Ertugrul in your hands.

01:10:36.797 --> 01:10:38.697
Do not worry, Mother Hayme.

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:13.464
You said you would not give me to them
even the whole world came together.

01:11:14.164 --> 01:11:16.164
And you did not.

01:11:19.364 --> 01:11:21.830
Do not go and leave me alone, Ertugrul.

01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:26.730
The day when I accepted death
instead of being another man's woman...

01:11:26.797 --> 01:11:29.430
...these words made me cling to life.

01:11:32.164 --> 01:11:34.064
I did not give up.

01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:39.697
And you do not give up, either.

01:11:44.097 --> 01:11:45.930
Come back to me, Ertugrul.

01:11:47.597 --> 01:11:50.930
I will not give up on you
as long as your breath.

01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:24.430
So, they hid the marriage of Sultan
Alaeddin and the Damascene Queen from me.

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:28.797
We knew about it
before the dowry train set off from Konya.

01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:34.130
This marriage would not fit
into our best interests, Kurdoglu.

01:12:35.097 --> 01:12:37.797
And yours, either.

01:12:38.564 --> 01:12:42.364
That train will not arrive for the Queen.

01:12:42.964 --> 01:12:45.030
I will not let this happen.

01:12:45.997 --> 01:12:48.530
We know the train's every move.

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:52.630
That the Sultan
wanted help from the Kayis.

01:12:52.697 --> 01:12:53.964
Everything.

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:56.597
But there is one man who troubles me.

01:12:56.697 --> 01:13:01.130
Ertugrul. He cannot take the train there.
He is seriously wounded.

01:13:01.397 --> 01:13:03.864
It is a miracle that he even lives
with that wound.

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:09.130
Turgut Alp opened the strongest hole
I have ever seen in his body.

01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:12.897
However, sometimes
God does not allow someone to die.

01:13:12.964 --> 01:13:17.097
Whoever goes, will die with the messenger.

01:13:18.464 --> 01:13:20.797
The train is our business.

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:23.530
You strengthen your power in the tent.

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:25.564
We will take care of the rest.

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:29.730
There will not be a better opportunity
to overturn Suleyman Shah...

01:13:29.797 --> 01:13:32.630
...while Ertugrul is in this situation.

01:13:32.697 --> 01:13:34.964
I cannot bear anymore, either.

01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:37.497
Each passing day is to my detriment.

01:13:37.597 --> 01:13:41.430
Sooner or later, they will find out
I am cooperating with you.

01:13:41.864 --> 01:13:43.730
You are right.

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:49.430
I am relieved to see that we think alike.

01:13:49.864 --> 01:13:53.664
But first, you will
turn two people over to me.

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:56.897
Ibn al-Arabi and the young Shahzade.

01:13:58.164 --> 01:14:00.697
Ibn al-Arabi will set off tomorrow.

01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:04.097
There will be nobody else
except his dervish with him.

01:14:04.164 --> 01:14:07.597
-Good.
-As for the young Shahzade...

01:14:08.364 --> 01:14:11.797
...do not worry.
Yigit will come to you himself.

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:27.097
Do not say it. I know that
you trust me most in this tent.

01:14:27.164 --> 01:14:30.097
But do not say the duty
your father gave to you even to me.

01:14:30.164 --> 01:14:33.830
Selcan, what are you saying?
There is nobody except us here.

01:14:33.897 --> 01:14:35.597
Walls have ears.

01:14:35.664 --> 01:14:38.130
May God protect you.

01:14:40.364 --> 01:14:43.664
You cannot say no
to Sultan Alaeedin...

01:14:43.797 --> 01:14:47.764
...when he sends a messenger
to the tent and requests from your father.

01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:52.464
However, what is important is that
your father gave you this duty.

01:14:52.564 --> 01:14:55.830
You see how everything has changed,
do you not?

01:14:55.897 --> 01:14:58.664
You fought with knights
and defeated them.

01:14:58.730 --> 01:15:02.064
You saved your brother and the Alps
and brought them to the tent.

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:04.997
You found a good customer
for the flock.

01:15:05.097 --> 01:15:08.464
You brought trust and gold
to our tent.

01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:10.930
You know what this means,
do you not?

01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:14.530
It is for you, woman.

01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:17.664
For our future baby if God permits.

01:15:20.497 --> 01:15:24.864
But as I said, do not let
even the Alps know where you are going.

01:15:24.964 --> 01:15:27.730
And what are you going to do.
God forbid.

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:32.930
I am scared that something happens to you
if that ominous infidel hears of  it.

01:15:37.164 --> 01:15:39.464
What about my uncle?

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:47.664
You must watch out
especially for Kurdoglu.

01:15:49.597 --> 01:15:54.397
It would be good if you found out
if he is a traitor with a little trick.

01:15:54.464 --> 01:15:57.864
He will be your closest ally
on this way to be the Bey.

01:15:58.497 --> 01:16:02.430
One who goes on the wrong way
does not find the right way ever.

01:16:10.164 --> 01:16:11.964
What is in your mind?

01:16:13.597 --> 01:16:16.997
I will tell my uncle
about the duty that was given to me.

01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:23.630
But I will mistake him.

01:16:24.897 --> 01:16:27.930
You will lure him to make a mistake.

01:16:28.864 --> 01:16:32.164
If my uncle is a traitor...

01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:36.830
...he will tell the news to the Templars
and make them ambush me.

01:16:38.097 --> 01:16:40.797
If that happens, I will shed him blood.

01:16:40.864 --> 01:16:45.864
Otherwise, he will be my
biggest ally on the way to be the Bey.

01:17:25.997 --> 01:17:27.830
My daughter!

01:17:31.797 --> 01:17:34.130
-Father!
-You must not come here.

01:17:34.364 --> 01:17:36.030
It is very dangerous.

01:17:36.097 --> 01:17:38.664
I found a way to get you out of here.

01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:23.430
May God heal you
with the quality of his name "ash-Shaafi".

01:18:26.097 --> 01:18:27.497
Amen.

01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:15.130
He is healed with the permission of God.

01:19:16.064 --> 01:19:18.664
Keep an eye on him at all times.

01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:25.364
We have to go now.

01:19:26.497 --> 01:19:29.030
I wish you would not leave us alone.

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:34.564
Do not worry. This brave man
has so many protectors by his side.

01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:40.564
I will give you something before we leave.

01:19:41.397 --> 01:19:44.830
You will give it to Ertugrul
if he heals before I come back.

01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:49.164
Do not you ever look inside it.

01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:53.597
I will protect it at the cost of my life.

01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:11.464
Good thinking.
Only the Kayis can do this.

01:20:11.964 --> 01:20:16.830
And you can freed this young man
from the effects of the drugs.

01:20:17.997 --> 01:20:21.964
I will come back with the Kayis
and get you out of here.

01:20:22.064 --> 01:20:26.697
If my sheikh Ibn al-Arabi
is in the tent as they say...

01:20:26.764 --> 01:20:29.497
...tell him that I did my duty.

01:20:29.597 --> 01:20:33.797
I remembered him every night
in my prayers.

01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:38.397
God help you, my daughter.

01:20:45.464 --> 01:20:46.764
Goodbye, father.

01:20:47.497 --> 01:20:49.464
This is not a farewell.

01:20:49.597 --> 01:20:51.397
Because I will be back.

01:21:24.664 --> 01:21:26.930
What are we going to do
with Aykiz?

01:21:26.997 --> 01:21:29.030
She clearly sees us as enemy.

01:21:29.130 --> 01:21:32.764
What if she is on the same side
with her traitor husband?

01:21:33.597 --> 01:21:35.930
What if they were
spreading news about the tent?

01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:37.864
-Woah!
-Why are  you surprised?

01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:40.864
Would you believe that
Turgut would stab Ertugrul Bey?

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:42.930
I would shove down your throat.

01:21:42.997 --> 01:21:45.397
Yes! See?

01:21:53.697 --> 01:21:57.064
By the way,
how can we know if Aykiz is a traitor?

01:21:59.964 --> 01:22:02.430
We will go and hold Turgut first.

01:22:03.764 --> 01:22:09.097
We will hang him with hooks
smaller than my nails...

01:22:10.664 --> 01:22:13.030
...which stretch his from head to toe.

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:17.830
We will chop his white flesh
and cook black roast from it.

01:22:19.630 --> 01:22:22.030
And we will put it in front of Aykiz.

01:22:22.664 --> 01:22:24.364
What if she eats it?

01:22:26.097 --> 01:22:30.864
Then, she will wish Sister Selcan
whipped her again.

01:22:32.064 --> 01:22:36.664
She will think that pain is much lighter
compared to what I will do.

01:22:57.664 --> 01:23:01.064
You must help me if you want God
to forgive your sins.

01:23:01.897 --> 01:23:04.597
I will do what is necessary, milady.

01:23:04.664 --> 01:23:09.597
-You must get me out of this castle.
-But... you cannot come back again.

01:23:09.864 --> 01:23:11.764
I will not be alone when I do.

01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:13.697
Where are you going?

01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:16.164
To the Kayi Tent.

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:17.997
To find Ertugrul Bey.

01:23:19.097 --> 01:23:20.697
And Aykiz.

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:23.730
Turgut's wife.

01:23:24.497 --> 01:23:26.797
Alps, may I come in?

01:23:26.864 --> 01:23:28.597
Come in, sister.

01:23:43.564 --> 01:23:47.564
I have been loving him
since I was born into this black world.

01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:55.597
He was my brave man whom I loved
since the moment I opened my eyes.

01:23:57.797 --> 01:24:02.464
I said "Those black mountains
are no good to me after  you are gone."

01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:05.930
I said, "May those highlands be my tomb."

01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:10.930
I said, "May those cold waters
be my blood."

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:16.464
I said "May your horse be my shroud
if I ever ride it."

01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:24.464
I said "May the colorful snake bite me
if I love another man after you."

01:24:26.764 --> 01:24:30.797
I said "May my life
be a sacrifice for you."

01:24:31.964 --> 01:24:36.730
However, if he did what you are saying...

01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:41.664
...you should know that
it is my duty to take Turgut's life.

01:24:43.797 --> 01:24:47.630
If you go after that bastard
and not take me with you...

01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:52.397
...you should know that
I will not give you my blessing ever.

01:25:15.864 --> 01:25:17.364
Turgut Alp.

01:25:18.964 --> 01:25:23.764
They were giving him something like
potion in the Templars' castle.

01:25:23.964 --> 01:25:25.164
A blue liquid.

01:25:29.164 --> 01:25:31.430
They were torturing him heavily.

01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:35.897
There is a catch...

01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:40.030
...but what?

01:26:05.464 --> 01:26:08.030
We need to go, Suleyman Shah.

01:26:08.097 --> 01:26:11.464
We could not welcome you well,
sorry for that.

01:26:11.564 --> 01:26:13.430
No problem.

01:26:13.497 --> 01:26:15.064
When will we see you again?

01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:17.930
I will be back... if God permits.

01:26:19.364 --> 01:26:20.797
We will be waiting.

01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:27.597
May God protect you.

01:26:27.664 --> 01:26:29.830
Always pray for us, please.

01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:32.897
My prayers are always with you.

01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:34.364
Thank you.

01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:19.730
Soldier, good luck.

01:27:19.930 --> 01:27:21.530
Good luck.

01:27:31.464 --> 01:27:33.930
Soldier... good luck.

01:27:46.564 --> 01:27:48.430
Good luck, soldier.

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:56.397
Hamza, let the Alps I chose say goodbye to
their families and ask for their blessing.

01:27:57.164 --> 01:28:00.464
Let them smell their children
if they have and be ready.

01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:02.630
Understood, Bey.

01:28:18.930 --> 01:28:20.697
What is it, Gundogdu?

01:28:24.364 --> 01:28:26.764
You look like you are going hunting.

01:28:27.164 --> 01:28:29.764
Do you ever miss anything, uncle?

01:28:30.964 --> 01:28:34.430
They did not name me "Kurdoglu"
without a reason.

01:28:34.897 --> 01:28:37.730
What is this preparation for?

01:28:38.597 --> 01:28:41.930
Or are you going to hide this
from me, as well...

01:28:41.997 --> 01:28:45.064
...like you hid you were
going to take Ertugrul?

01:28:45.997 --> 01:28:47.964
I trust you completely, uncle.

01:28:48.030 --> 01:28:50.364
First my father, then to you.

01:28:51.730 --> 01:28:53.697
What is going on, then?

01:28:53.797 --> 01:28:56.464
What are you going to do
with your Alps?

01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:01.730
Alaeddin's messengers are going to come.

01:29:01.797 --> 01:29:06.030
I will meet them at Busra Hill
near Aleppo and take them to Damascus.

01:29:06.130 --> 01:29:09.097
Alaeddin wants to marry
the Damascene emeer's niece.

01:29:09.164 --> 01:29:11.097
They will ask for blessing.

01:29:11.164 --> 01:29:12.864
Well, well, well.

01:29:12.964 --> 01:29:14.664
The big alliance.

01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:18.697
So they threw you
onto the line of fire again.

01:29:18.764 --> 01:29:23.030
If the Templars heard of this,
it will be very difficult for you.

01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:27.864
You did the right thing
to hide this even from your Alps.

01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:33.564
We have to hide everything until we
find out who the traitor among us is.

01:29:36.164 --> 01:29:39.064
Do you have anything else to tell me?

01:29:39.130 --> 01:29:42.164
I only want your prayers, uncle.
Nothing else.

01:29:42.930 --> 01:29:45.897
My prayers are
always with you, Gundogdu.

01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:47.697
Amen.

01:29:54.797 --> 01:30:01.564
Go to Busra Hill and lay an ambush.

01:30:01.864 --> 01:30:04.097
I will go to Damascus on another way.

01:30:04.397 --> 01:30:09.864
If anybody from the Templars'
or Kurdoglu's men come, behead them.

01:30:11.097 --> 01:30:12.697
Understood, Bey.

01:30:16.497 --> 01:30:20.664
Let us see
if my uncle is a traitor or not.

01:32:19.764 --> 01:32:23.697
I heard that you sent a troop
to have Ibn al-Arabi taken, sir.

01:32:23.764 --> 01:32:26.730
You have a more important duty, Titus.

01:32:27.664 --> 01:32:31.764
I did not want to send you
for just an old man and a dervish.

01:32:32.730 --> 01:32:34.064
What is it, sir?

01:32:34.997 --> 01:32:37.430
Sultan Alaeddin.

01:32:37.497 --> 01:32:40.797
He is sending a messenger
to have the blessings to marry...

01:32:40.897 --> 01:32:44.397
...the Damascene emeer's niece
with the support of the Kayis.

01:32:44.464 --> 01:32:50.464
Neither the messenger, nor the train
or Gundogdu who escorts them...

01:32:51.364 --> 01:32:53.497
...should come back.

01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:58.364
Understood, sir.

01:32:59.464 --> 01:33:01.430
As to you, Eftelya.

01:33:02.097 --> 01:33:05.964
Tonight, you will take the report
that the Cardinal wrote.

01:33:11.630 --> 01:33:15.397
After you make sure
he falls into sleep with this drug...

01:33:15.497 --> 01:33:18.164
...we will read that report line by line.

01:33:19.397 --> 01:33:25.664
If he wrote lies about us,
he will never wake up.

01:33:27.764 --> 01:33:29.897
Then, you will go to Damascus.

01:33:30.597 --> 01:33:33.164
If things go wrong...

01:33:33.664 --> 01:33:35.897
...you will do what is necessary...

01:33:35.964 --> 01:33:40.364
...to prevent a bride to go
from the palace to Konya.

01:34:23.464 --> 01:34:26.830
Peace be upon you, brothers.

01:34:27.964 --> 01:34:30.430
The chest you are carrying.

01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:34.730
The one with the relic in it
which no mortal has seen before.

01:34:35.864 --> 01:34:39.997
Will you give it yourself,
or shall we take it by force?

01:34:46.964 --> 01:34:50.464
Do not extend your hand
to take things from people.

01:34:51.964 --> 01:34:57.897
You can only take it if you know that
it is God Almighty who gives in reality.

01:34:58.997 --> 01:35:04.730
In that case, only take the amount
that your knowledge sees appropriate.

01:35:06.130 --> 01:35:08.097
Drop that carpetbag!

01:35:31.930 --> 01:35:33.830
Where is the relic?

01:35:34.630 --> 01:35:36.397
Here.

01:35:40.764 --> 01:35:44.897
If you want to learn,
I can tell you with my mouth.

01:35:46.130 --> 01:35:49.097
If you want to pull it out from me...

01:35:49.164 --> 01:35:52.497
...my heart is as close as your sword
to you, son.

01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:02.730
Leave the old man alone.

01:36:03.597 --> 01:36:05.130
Go on your way.

01:36:05.364 --> 01:36:06.897
Silence that man!

01:37:15.064 --> 01:37:17.030
I must have fallen asleep.

01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:20.397
You were awake the whole night.

01:37:20.464 --> 01:37:22.630
Go and get some rest.

01:37:22.697 --> 01:37:24.530
I will stay by his side.

01:37:25.064 --> 01:37:27.030
I was with Ertugrul.

01:37:28.097 --> 01:37:30.097
Thankfully, he is good, as well.

01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:32.430
Thank God.

01:37:34.664 --> 01:37:36.164
Go and get some sleep.

01:37:36.397 --> 01:37:38.630
Any news from Kurdoglu?

01:37:38.697 --> 01:37:39.930
No.

01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:43.730
Gundogdu's trick
will reveal everything before the sunset.

01:37:43.797 --> 01:37:48.164
I am praying. I hope all the things
we have thought of Kurdoglu...

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:51.964
...were nothing but delusions.

01:37:52.797 --> 01:37:54.130
Hopefully, Bey.

01:37:55.130 --> 01:37:56.697
Hopefully.

01:37:56.797 --> 01:38:00.964
If the traitor among us is him...

01:38:01.664 --> 01:38:04.930
...I will make him pay
in the most severe way possible.

01:38:04.997 --> 01:38:07.930
But if he is not...

01:38:09.764 --> 01:38:14.764
...I will ask my blood brother
to forgive me for all my delusions.

01:38:27.564 --> 01:38:29.164
I wronged you.

01:38:34.964 --> 01:38:36.464
Forgive me.

01:38:41.964 --> 01:38:44.164
Allow me to be your dervish.

01:38:44.397 --> 01:38:47.364
Give my life for you and your way.

01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:38.897
Sister, go and help them with the rugs.

01:39:45.964 --> 01:39:47.530
Did Gundogdu try to lure you?

01:39:47.597 --> 01:39:48.730
He did.

01:39:48.797 --> 01:39:52.064
He thinks I will denounce it
to the Templars.

01:39:52.130 --> 01:39:53.864
He will see that he is mistaken.

01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:58.530
And then, he will bring peace
to the tent with his uncle.

01:40:00.397 --> 01:40:02.397
There is a lot of doubt about us.

01:40:02.497 --> 01:40:03.930
Mother Hayme?

01:40:03.997 --> 01:40:07.497
Do not worry.
Those doubts will also go away.

01:40:07.730 --> 01:40:08.930
How?

01:40:09.664 --> 01:40:12.764
Spring came to the tent,
are you not aware?

01:40:13.130 --> 01:40:14.730
Just smile a little.

01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:19.597
Stop the nonsense. I said how?

01:40:19.697 --> 01:40:23.564
Today, the traitor in the tent
will be revealed.

01:40:23.997 --> 01:40:26.564
Watch what happens after that.

01:40:26.630 --> 01:40:28.030
Where will he be revealed?

01:40:28.097 --> 01:40:30.564
By the side of Ertugrul's corpse.

01:40:33.130 --> 01:40:35.030
Do not worry.

01:42:11.730 --> 01:42:13.430
Have a seat.

01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:20.930
Is everything ready?

01:42:20.997 --> 01:42:22.130
Yes, Bey.

01:42:22.364 --> 01:42:23.797
Do not worry.

01:42:23.864 --> 01:42:25.664
Everything will be very easy.

01:42:25.797 --> 01:42:26.997
Good.

01:42:34.864 --> 01:42:36.130
Open it.

01:42:53.397 --> 01:42:55.964
You will have the rest
when Ertugrul dies.

01:42:59.164 --> 01:43:01.997
What are you going to do
with all this gold?

01:43:02.497 --> 01:43:05.697
The biggest flock of the tent
will be mine, Bey.

01:43:20.630 --> 01:43:21.930
Stupid.

01:43:22.364 --> 01:43:26.797
You are the biggest ox in that flock,
but you are not aware of it.

01:43:45.897 --> 01:43:48.564
Well, well, well.

01:43:51.597 --> 01:43:54.397
The daughter of the tent is taking a walk.

01:44:00.364 --> 01:44:04.364
Sultan Hatun would probably
not bother to talk to us.

01:44:06.497 --> 01:44:08.530
She does not see this fit...

01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:14.430
...but she confuses people saying "I am
the daughter of this tent from now on."

01:44:14.864 --> 01:44:16.830
Selcan Hatun.

01:44:17.597 --> 01:44:20.964
I would not even think of
one of the things you said.

01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:23.464
However, you had hard times.

01:44:23.564 --> 01:44:25.630
I refrain from breaking your heart.

01:44:25.697 --> 01:44:28.497
One would think you were an angel.

01:44:29.464 --> 01:44:32.830
If you are so much concerned about
other people's hearts...

01:44:32.897 --> 01:44:35.797
...think about what you have done
to my sister.

01:44:35.864 --> 01:44:38.664
What could I have possibly
done to your sister?

01:44:38.730 --> 01:44:42.697
I have neither said a bad word
nor threw an evil glance to her.

01:44:42.764 --> 01:44:47.130
We know loose girls like you that have
been brought up in the palace.

01:44:48.397 --> 01:44:50.664
We have seen a lot of countries.

01:44:50.764 --> 01:44:53.864
There are so many girls like you.

01:44:56.164 --> 01:45:00.530
It is obvious that you spend your time
in palaces, Selcan Hatun.

01:45:04.630 --> 01:45:07.064
I told this to you
the first day you came here.

01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:11.564
"This tent is not for you.
Go to your own homeland."

01:45:12.697 --> 01:45:14.097
I turned out to be right.

01:45:14.164 --> 01:45:16.630
We suffered so much because of you.

01:45:16.697 --> 01:45:18.797
Now you came back.

01:45:18.897 --> 01:45:21.630
You constantly hurt my sister.

01:45:21.964 --> 01:45:25.830
I am with the man I love
who loves me back, Selcan Hatun.

01:45:26.497 --> 01:45:30.430
I have not done anything to your sister,
and I would never do.

01:45:32.364 --> 01:45:34.830
What about his father?

01:45:35.464 --> 01:45:37.064
What about Suleyman Shah?

01:45:37.164 --> 01:45:40.930
He told Ertugrul to marry Gokce
as part of his will.

01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:45.530
Ertugrul Bey would never do anything
other than what his father says.

01:45:46.097 --> 01:45:48.830
If you have not still learned that...

01:45:49.864 --> 01:45:51.564
...you are either blind or ill-minded.

01:45:51.630 --> 01:45:54.164
Or really a stupid girl in love.

01:45:55.697 --> 01:45:58.964
I am the girl Ertugrul Bey loves,
Selcan Hatun.

01:46:00.764 --> 01:46:03.797
I left behind everything I have
and came to him.

01:46:04.864 --> 01:46:07.364
And I am this tent's girl
until he tells me to go.

01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:11.030
I came because he told me to.
I can go if he tells me to.

01:46:12.130 --> 01:46:14.664
But this will only happen by his word.

01:46:15.164 --> 01:46:17.830
Not by your or Suleyman Shah's word.

01:46:18.864 --> 01:46:21.797
Make no mistake about it, Selcan Hatun.

01:46:21.897 --> 01:46:24.964
It is obvious that
we will not get rid of you...

01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:30.797
...until he sends you away,
or until Ertugrul comes to grief.

01:46:38.130 --> 01:46:41.530
And he will come to grief soon, anyway.

01:46:56.497 --> 01:46:58.164
Good luck, son.

01:46:58.397 --> 01:46:59.630
Thank you, father.

01:47:13.764 --> 01:47:15.630
Good luck, niece.

01:47:15.730 --> 01:47:17.797
Thank you, uncle.

01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:37.530
Alright. Bismillah.

01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:10.630
This is an important duty, Bey.

01:48:10.763 --> 01:48:14.130
If he succeeds, the way to be a bey
will open for Gundogdu.

01:48:14.197 --> 01:48:18.363
He showed everybody that
he is a son fitting a father like you.

01:48:19.397 --> 01:48:21.963
What do you want
from my son, Kurdoglu?

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:26.963
I see the future of the tent
in his hands.

01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:31.863
If I see you are mistaken,
I support my niece.

01:48:31.963 --> 01:48:35.363
I open his eyes
to see what is right or wrong.

01:48:36.330 --> 01:48:37.863
What are you saying?

01:48:37.930 --> 01:48:40.363
You know me, Bey. I do not lie.

01:48:40.763 --> 01:48:42.630
I am a frank man.

01:48:43.163 --> 01:48:45.363
You harnessed the wrong horse.

01:48:45.597 --> 01:48:47.330
Do you know when?

01:48:47.397 --> 01:48:51.697
The day when you sent Ertugrul
to Aleppo as your messenger.

01:48:51.797 --> 01:48:53.797
This is the day, now.

01:48:53.897 --> 01:48:56.030
I am not dead yet, Kurdoglu!

01:48:56.130 --> 01:48:59.763
The future of the tent
does not rely on your lifetime.

01:49:00.330 --> 01:49:02.597
I do not want anything for myself.

01:49:02.663 --> 01:49:04.763
We are all meant to die someday.

01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:08.797
I have common sense and it does not
let me leave this tent...

01:49:08.863 --> 01:49:12.097
...for the sake of which I have lost
my woman and children...

01:49:12.197 --> 01:49:15.297
...to a rascal's hands
who runs after women.

01:49:16.197 --> 01:49:18.030
And this is the point.

01:49:49.230 --> 01:49:51.330
Are your knights ready?

01:49:51.397 --> 01:49:53.063
Yes, sir.

01:49:53.163 --> 01:49:54.863
They are waiting for me in Hara.

01:49:54.930 --> 01:50:01.330
Good. I want you to go after Ertugrul
with Judas, after that.

01:50:02.630 --> 01:50:04.963
Finish him in his weakest moment.

01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:10.630
I want this handled before the
Council of the Templars come together.

01:50:10.930 --> 01:50:12.330
Yes, sir.

01:50:45.063 --> 01:50:46.963
Thank you for the ride, uncle.

01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:51.597
Isadora. I got Windmill prepared for you.

01:50:52.363 --> 01:50:54.797
It is a meek and clever horse.

01:50:57.063 --> 01:50:58.397
Thank you, uncle.

01:50:58.663 --> 01:51:01.630
Enjoy the ride, Isadora.

01:51:15.897 --> 01:51:19.297
We will not be defeated as long as
we have men like you...

01:51:19.363 --> 01:51:21.730
...who think about
the future of the tent.

01:51:21.797 --> 01:51:23.597
Thank you.

01:51:24.897 --> 01:51:26.630
Karabudak?

01:51:26.697 --> 01:51:28.063
What do you think?

01:51:29.397 --> 01:51:31.863
You are right, Bey.

01:51:31.930 --> 01:51:36.797
You are a very experienced warrior
and server to the tent.

01:51:37.097 --> 01:51:40.363
We trust every word
that comes out of your mouth.

01:51:42.897 --> 01:51:44.863
However...

01:51:44.963 --> 01:51:46.230
However?

01:51:47.730 --> 01:51:49.763
He cannot say it out of his respect.

01:51:49.863 --> 01:51:51.363
Let me say it myself.

01:51:51.663 --> 01:51:54.697
It is clear that
you have talked about this.

01:51:55.697 --> 01:51:59.597
When it comes to Suleyman Shah,
we have to think twice.

01:51:59.697 --> 01:52:01.630
You know it best, Kurdoglu.

01:52:02.163 --> 01:52:05.363
You have talked all night like crickets.

01:52:05.997 --> 01:52:08.030
So, what is the result?

01:52:08.130 --> 01:52:12.630
Why do you want Gundogdu
to be the bey, but not you?

01:52:16.130 --> 01:52:20.197
I do not have my eyes
on any seat or gold.

01:52:21.197 --> 01:52:25.930
If I did, I would have done it
when we were having the hardest times.

01:52:27.163 --> 01:52:29.697
But, why Gundogdu?

01:52:29.763 --> 01:52:31.797
What is your in for it?

01:52:33.063 --> 01:52:36.863
You will understand
when your pockets will be full of gold...

01:52:36.930 --> 01:52:39.163
...after the selling of the flocks.

01:52:39.597 --> 01:52:43.630
Our people who have lost
their children, husbands and flocks...

01:52:43.697 --> 01:52:48.263
...because of Ertugrul and his father
will also understand.

01:52:49.697 --> 01:52:53.597
Only people who suffer
know what pain means.

01:52:54.997 --> 01:52:58.797
Our tent is full of widows
mothers without children.

01:52:58.897 --> 01:53:02.097
Do you want a bey...

01:53:02.997 --> 01:53:07.063
...who confuses people
with dreams of war...

01:53:07.997 --> 01:53:13.197
...or a bey who knows what to do
and revives his tent.

01:53:15.863 --> 01:53:19.763
Is it about the sword
being strong in its sheath...

01:53:19.863 --> 01:53:24.930
...or coming out of its sheath
and suffer pain after pain?

01:53:55.963 --> 01:53:57.930
Bey, are you alright?

01:53:59.397 --> 01:54:01.730
I am.

01:54:01.797 --> 01:54:03.963
I am, but...

01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:07.263
...nothing will be the same
anymore, Hayme.

01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:09.897
Kurdoglu opened my eyes.

01:54:10.030 --> 01:54:11.663
He woke me up.

01:54:12.630 --> 01:54:14.197
What are you saying, Bey?

01:54:14.263 --> 01:54:17.130
Even if it is your son...

01:54:17.197 --> 01:54:19.397
...when it is time to be the bey...

01:54:20.097 --> 01:54:22.730
...arrogance shows itself.

01:54:24.197 --> 01:54:27.330
Things that we have heard
from the Oghuz sagas...

01:54:27.597 --> 01:54:32.130
...have been going on around us,
but we were not aware of them.

01:54:34.297 --> 01:54:37.830
But now, I see everything more clearly.

01:54:37.897 --> 01:54:39.397
What do you see?

01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:43.330
When the bey gets older...

01:54:43.597 --> 01:54:46.230
...and arrogance shows itself...

01:54:47.097 --> 01:54:50.097
...storms in the tent will not calm ever.

01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:57.897
Maybe it is best to abdicate
when everything is settled down.

01:56:12.963 --> 01:56:17.363
The marriage between the Damascene Queen
and Sultan Alaeddin is very important.

01:56:17.597 --> 01:56:21.997
Sultan Alaeedin declared that for the
sake of strengthening the alliance...

01:56:22.197 --> 01:56:24.797
...between the Ayyubids and Seljuk...

01:56:24.863 --> 01:56:28.830
...he will declare the child of this
marriage his heir to the throne.

01:56:28.930 --> 01:56:31.363
I saw Sultan Alaeddin's
presents of nine.

01:56:32.063 --> 01:56:35.630
The nine horses and the nine slaves.

01:56:35.730 --> 01:56:38.097
Who knows what else are inside them.

01:56:38.163 --> 01:56:40.797
It is worthy of Seljuk.

01:56:40.863 --> 01:56:43.663
It is a hard but accurate decision.

01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:48.063
I understand now why you wanted to keep
the train going to Damascus a secret.

01:56:48.130 --> 01:56:50.930
But if those infidels find out about it...

01:56:51.130 --> 01:56:54.097
...they will do everything
to prevent this.

01:56:56.197 --> 01:56:58.063
Thank you, brother.

01:56:59.263 --> 01:57:00.897
What about Kurdoglu?

01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:04.863
I trust my uncle completely.

01:57:05.297 --> 01:57:08.263
But my father and Ertugrul
feel suspicious.

01:57:08.897 --> 01:57:11.397
I understood there was a problem...

01:57:11.630 --> 01:57:15.663
...when Suleyman Shah
wanted to speak with me alone.

01:57:16.663 --> 01:57:20.630
You should know that
I have fought Kurdoglu before.

01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:24.263
He is one of the best warriors
I have seen. He is brave.

01:57:24.330 --> 01:57:28.163
And he has been serving your father
for such a long time.

01:57:28.230 --> 01:57:32.197
Your uncle will overcome
your trick blamelessly.

01:57:33.097 --> 01:57:37.330
Thank you, Ersagun Bey.
We will set off whenever you want.

01:57:37.397 --> 01:57:42.230
We are ready, but first
let us have some meal.

01:57:42.663 --> 01:57:44.697
We have a long way ahead of us.

01:57:44.797 --> 01:57:47.130
Thank you. Altogether. Please.

01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:03.197
Isadora...

01:59:03.730 --> 01:59:05.030
Uncle...

01:59:28.863 --> 01:59:30.230
Greetings.

01:59:36.297 --> 01:59:37.297
Yes, my girl.

01:59:37.363 --> 01:59:38.763
I am looking for Aykiz.

01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:39.963
Aykiz?

01:59:40.730 --> 01:59:42.963
I am her father. Who are you?

01:59:43.997 --> 01:59:48.663
I am coming from the Templars' castle.
My name is Isadora Manzini.

01:59:49.097 --> 01:59:52.397
I am
Grandmaster Petruchio Manzini's niece.

01:59:53.130 --> 01:59:55.230
I brought news from Turgut Alp.

02:00:00.263 --> 02:00:02.297
What do you mean she ran away?

02:00:03.863 --> 02:00:05.697
Where could my niece go?

02:00:05.763 --> 02:00:07.030
Why should he go?

02:00:07.130 --> 02:00:10.763
She untied her horse
and ran away before letting us know, sir.

02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:13.697
Damn it!

02:00:23.630 --> 02:00:27.363
PLACE NEAR ALEPPO
BUSRA HILL

02:00:28.097 --> 02:00:30.697
Bey, there is nobody coming.

02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:33.163
We should go before the sunset.

02:00:33.230 --> 02:00:35.630
We have a long way ahead of us.

02:00:39.963 --> 02:00:41.297
You are right.

02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:44.363
Let us go back.

02:00:44.597 --> 02:00:47.163
Tell the Alps to get prepared.

02:00:47.230 --> 02:00:49.863
We should not make Gundogdu Bey wait.

02:00:50.697 --> 02:00:53.097
So, Kurdoglu is not a traitor.

02:00:53.897 --> 02:00:55.663
Oh my...

02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:58.663
We accused him wrongly.

02:00:58.763 --> 02:01:00.630
What did you say?

02:01:00.730 --> 02:01:03.363
Never mind.
Get prepared. Let us set off.

02:01:22.730 --> 02:01:24.330
Where is she?

02:01:27.297 --> 02:01:29.963
My daughter
knows everything about you.

02:01:31.130 --> 02:01:34.963
What kind of murderer and evil you are...

02:01:35.663 --> 02:01:38.196
She knows everything about you.

02:01:38.297 --> 02:01:39.730
How?

02:01:40.230 --> 02:01:43.097
How did she find out you were alive?

02:01:43.196 --> 02:01:45.097
You will never know.

02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:49.630
I found out about Ibn al-Arabi's secret.

02:01:50.897 --> 02:01:52.963
I do not need you anymore.

02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:58.197
You need to be a human first
in order to know that secret.

02:01:59.130 --> 02:02:03.697
I need neither you nor your daughter.

02:02:03.997 --> 02:02:07.630
My daughter will prevent you
from gaining a victory.

02:02:12.797 --> 02:02:18.030
I bear witness that there is no god...

02:02:18.163 --> 02:02:21.963
...there is only God.

02:04:58.097 --> 02:05:01.697
Intended for Turgut, realized by me.

02:07:01.330 --> 02:07:03.697
Damn it.

02:07:51.197 --> 02:07:52.697
Gokce...

02:08:50.863 --> 02:08:52.630
We will spend the night here.

02:08:52.997 --> 02:08:56.063
Riza, tell our men
that they can have a rest...

02:08:56.130 --> 02:08:59.397
...after they take the necessary measures.

02:08:59.630 --> 02:09:00.897
Yes, Bey.

02:09:01.663 --> 02:09:04.130
Take the horses to the creek down there.

02:09:04.197 --> 02:09:07.363
Keep the horses that are the Sultan's
present away from the others.

02:09:07.597 --> 02:09:08.830
Yes, Bey.

02:09:55.630 --> 02:09:58.830
We always take
our brothers' revenge, Titus.

02:09:59.930 --> 02:10:02.363
We, too.

02:10:03.163 --> 02:10:05.763
This war has just started, Gundogdu.

02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:07.630
You are right.

02:10:08.730 --> 02:10:10.830
But do not forget...

02:10:10.897 --> 02:10:13.963
...even if only one man
from our breed survives...

02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:16.697
...you will not have peace.
