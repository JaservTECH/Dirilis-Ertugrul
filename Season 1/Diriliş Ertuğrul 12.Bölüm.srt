11:51.316 --> 11:54.316
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

11:56.482 --> 11:59.482
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:00.346 --> 12:03.346
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

12:32.324 --> 12:34.957
I have had a delicious
feast prepared for you.

12:35.957 --> 12:39.224
In the honor of our little Shahzade's
liberation from the Templars...

12:40.857 --> 12:45.457
...and of course, of the Seljuk
and Ayyubid Dynasty's union.

12:46.091 --> 12:47.091
Here you are.

12:58.957 --> 13:00.124
Faster, faster!

13:23.324 --> 13:24.891
Please, help yourselves.

13:48.857 --> 13:51.257
I shouldn't have sent
Ertugrul alone to the palace.

13:52.191 --> 13:55.491
He wouldn't listen, Bey.
He does what he wants to do.

13:56.391 --> 13:57.757
Tell me about it, Dogan.

14:00.091 --> 14:01.691
When we were little..

14:04.291 --> 14:06.057
Hey man, when did you grow up?

14:07.457 --> 14:12.091
-Did I hear a mosquito buzz, or what?
-So, when you were little...

14:13.724 --> 14:17.491
We used to herd the flocks
at that time. Three jackals came.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.191
So crazy, their eyes were furious.

14:22.357 --> 14:25.391
Like a well without an end,
they were looking so dangerous.

14:27.791 --> 14:28.891
They caught the calf.

14:30.924 --> 14:34.291
And this Ertugrul...
We said: “Give up, they have gone”.

14:34.357 --> 14:35.391
He did not listen.

14:36.091 --> 14:39.391
For five days and nights
he kept running after those jackals...

14:39.457 --> 14:41.457
...in the freezing cold of winter.

14:42.991 --> 14:45.991
So we said, “This is Ertugrul”.
He did not give up...

14:46.057 --> 14:47.824
...and found those jackals.

14:49.757 --> 14:52.424
Suleyman Bey was so anxious.

14:53.357 --> 14:57.691
When Ertugrul was back,
he appeared before Suleyman Bey.

14:59.157 --> 15:02.157
His father said:
“Son, what have you done?”

15:04.357 --> 15:05.924
Ertugrul Bey replied:

15:06.957 --> 15:08.091
“Bey,” he said.

15:09.324 --> 15:12.224
“Today three jackals come, take the calf.

15:14.357 --> 15:18.224
They are rapacious, the other day they
will come to take their mother Sarikiz.

15:19.091 --> 15:21.991
And before you know it
they become frequent visitors. ”

15:27.957 --> 15:29.457
Why did you tell us this story?

15:31.491 --> 15:33.857
Knowing what sacrifices
he made for the calf...

15:35.124 --> 15:37.424
...I considered
what sacrifices he would make...

15:37.491 --> 15:40.757
...for his comrade Turgut and
for his loved one Sister Halime.

15:43.491 --> 15:44.757
So?

15:44.824 --> 15:48.324
So, I am filled with comfort, brother.

16:15.724 --> 16:19.391
<i>Damn their conspiracies</i>
 <i>and their states!</i>

16:21.457 --> 16:24.491
<i>Based on our relations</i>
 <i>in the past, I request you...</i>

16:26.224 --> 16:31.024
<i>...to get off my</i>
 <i>and my daughters' backs.</i>

16:34.824 --> 16:41.257
{\an8}Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem

16:44.424 --> 16:47.991
This temple is the Prophet Muhammad
and Umar bin Al-Khattab's gift...

16:48.491 --> 16:50.291
...for us the Muslims.

16:52.491 --> 16:55.391
This site is our virtue and honor.

16:59.857 --> 17:04.157
Jerusalem is our heart
and our heart is Jerusalem.

17:06.457 --> 17:08.424
For God's sake, El Fatiha.

17:26.957 --> 17:32.124
<i>Euzu billahi minesseytanirracim</i>
 <i>Bismillahirrahmanirahim.</i>

17:33.491 --> 17:34.857
<i>Fa la menna hu.</i>

17:37.357 --> 17:41.424
<i>La ilaha illallah.</i>

17:41.491 --> 17:45.724
<i>La ilaha illallah.</i>

19:54.691 --> 19:55.891
<i>Illallah.</i>

20:33.457 --> 20:37.124
{\an8}KAYI NOMAD TENTS

20:55.091 --> 20:57.757
The time has come. Be quick.

21:02.191 --> 21:03.691
Is everything all right?

21:03.757 --> 21:05.457
Yes, sir. We are ready.

21:06.424 --> 21:07.424
Good.

21:09.324 --> 21:11.257
There is blood on your face, sir.

21:18.457 --> 21:21.224
I came across an obstacle.
I cleared it out of the way.

21:25.957 --> 21:27.857
You know what you are going to do.

21:27.924 --> 21:29.224
You will wait for my sign.

21:29.291 --> 21:32.257
We dragged the Alps
at the marquee and the bridge...

21:32.324 --> 21:33.757
...to different directions.

21:33.824 --> 21:35.957
You will enter the marquee with my sign.

21:36.691 --> 21:41.191
You will come upon two guards
and the head of the marquee Rahman only.

21:42.257 --> 21:44.424
Finish them off quietly and fast.

21:45.457 --> 21:48.924
Whoever is in the marquee, kill them all.

21:51.457 --> 21:52.891
Your target is...

21:52.957 --> 21:54.857
...Suleyman Shah...

21:56.691 --> 21:58.024
...and his wife Hayme.

22:45.857 --> 22:51.991
You will not surrender the marquee
until the new Bey arrives and settles in.

22:52.057 --> 22:53.057
Aye, sir.

23:38.391 --> 23:40.091
Oh God, give me strength.

24:34.024 --> 24:37.724
We have fallen into the blind shafts
in the dark nights of Aleppo, Aktolgali.

24:39.224 --> 24:40.424
My heart is on fire.

24:43.891 --> 24:47.957
What rain or river may quench this fire?

24:57.257 --> 25:01.424
What weapon may be the
remedy for my despair...

25:05.424 --> 25:08.324
...while the jackals prey on
my young gazelle, huh, Aktolgali?

26:05.324 --> 26:09.457
Your participation in this
humble dinner I host in the honor of...

26:09.691 --> 26:12.191
...our little Shahzade's
rejoining us, honored me.

26:13.890 --> 26:18.191
I can read my prospective wife
Halime Sultan's happiness from her eyes.

26:20.191 --> 26:23.257
Thank God, Nanny,
God has shown us this day.

26:25.924 --> 26:29.924
Now if you excuse me, I want to
give a small gift to Halime Sultan...

26:29.991 --> 26:33.791
...for accepting a pitiful servant
like me to be her husband.

27:16.891 --> 27:22.291
I had this necklace brought
from India to give to the woman...

27:22.357 --> 27:24.124
...I had been looking for one day.

27:26.291 --> 27:27.291
That day is today.

27:31.357 --> 27:33.157
What about my brother Ertugrul?

29:39.857 --> 29:41.024
Halime...

29:42.291 --> 29:43.724
...are you fine, daughter?

29:45.457 --> 29:46.724
Your nose is bleeding.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.491
Excuse me.

29:57.224 --> 29:59.391
Do not go alone.
Leyla shall come with you.

30:00.691 --> 30:02.991
It is not a serious thing.
I can handle it myself.

30:24.357 --> 30:26.357
Forgive me, Ertugrul.

30:28.324 --> 30:29.724
Forgive me.

31:18.824 --> 31:21.157
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

31:39.724 --> 31:43.324
Son, you look so sad. Hope nothing is bad.

31:45.324 --> 31:47.791
The doors are being slammed on my face.

31:47.857 --> 31:49.924
The remedy is getting far away from me.

31:50.457 --> 31:53.224
The sky has turned into a cage
falling down on my chest.

31:54.224 --> 31:56.824
The wise call your situation as “qabz”.

31:57.891 --> 32:00.424
Sometimes God gives discomfort
to his devout servants.

32:01.157 --> 32:03.424
Wisdom is the child of patience.

32:04.457 --> 32:07.257
There is no tutor greater
than patience for a person.

32:08.824 --> 32:12.924
The seed which is not willing to let
it's shell rot, can not bear fruits.

32:15.091 --> 32:17.791
Son, do you know who Hizir is?

32:19.757 --> 32:22.791
I have heard his holy name. I pray...

32:23.491 --> 32:27.157
...to see him one day, to kiss
his hands and to get his blessings.

32:28.057 --> 32:31.791
My mom always prays
for Hizir to be my companion.

32:34.324 --> 32:40.057
Hizir was a soldier in
an army jihading for the sake of God.

32:41.224 --> 32:43.724
The army got stucked in between somewhere.

32:43.791 --> 32:48.257
Enemies on one side, extremely high
temperature and thirst on the other.

32:49.291 --> 32:50.957
They were all going to die.

32:52.957 --> 32:58.257
One of them had to risk death
to find water, for the others to be saved.

33:00.191 --> 33:03.324
Whereas, in the state of despair,
the mind abandons the head.

33:03.391 --> 33:05.391
The brave turns into a coward.

33:05.457 --> 33:08.224
The strong's hands weaken, eyes go blind.

33:10.091 --> 33:12.891
While others were talking
about who should go for water...

33:12.957 --> 33:14.757
...Hizir started running.

33:14.824 --> 33:18.357
He hit the road putting his life at stake.
He reached the water supply.

33:19.857 --> 33:22.991
When he came back
with water people realized that...

33:23.057 --> 33:25.291
...this water was
something of a different kind.

33:26.091 --> 33:29.157
The water he brought
was the “Water of Life”.

33:30.224 --> 33:36.957
Hizir found the water
people had been looking for ever.

33:38.791 --> 33:41.791
Do you know what
the “water of life” is, son?

33:41.857 --> 33:43.257
I do not know.

33:43.324 --> 33:46.724
”Water of Life” is the water
which makes you immortal.

33:47.791 --> 33:49.291
While this body is dying...

33:49.357 --> 33:52.357
...the soul that drinks the
“Water of Life” becomes immortal.

33:53.091 --> 33:55.391
“Water of Life” is the faith.

33:56.257 --> 33:58.724
”Water of Life” is love, son, love!

34:00.257 --> 34:03.991
It is the thing that turns a person
into a human, the dead into alive.

34:04.424 --> 34:06.424
It takes a person closer to God.

34:07.424 --> 34:08.791
So, what happened then?

34:09.991 --> 34:13.357
When they realized that
the water was the “Water of Life”...

34:13.424 --> 34:16.257
...they forgot about the danger
and started looking for it.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.957
But none of them could find it.

34:21.257 --> 34:24.757
Because the “Water of Life”
is a gift from God almighty...

34:25.857 --> 34:29.824
...not for the ones who go after it,
but for the ones who want to reach God...

34:29.891 --> 34:33.691
...with love and faith
by serving all God's creatures.

34:35.757 --> 34:38.491
You reach the “Water of Life”
by serving the people.

34:40.291 --> 34:43.491
Get up. Shake off the soil on you.

34:45.691 --> 34:49.291
Resuscitate like
how a man arises from dead.

34:50.057 --> 34:52.024
Do not sit and wait for Hizir to come.

34:52.824 --> 34:56.057
Be the Hizir for the people in despair.

34:57.124 --> 35:00.891
Bring the “Water of Life” to
the ones who are thirsty for faith.

35:01.491 --> 35:03.091
Your mission is this.

35:13.391 --> 35:17.757
{\an8}“Surely with that hardship comes more
ease” (Inshirah Surah, verse 6)

35:27.424 --> 35:29.857
<i>Surely with that hardship comes more ease.</i>

35:56.424 --> 35:59.224
Alps! You two go
and continue to guard there.

36:28.857 --> 36:31.257
What did you do about
the guards on the bridge?

36:31.324 --> 36:33.257
Did you clear out marquee?

36:33.324 --> 36:37.291
Yes Bey. I sent out my Alp.
We also sent out the ones on the bridge.

36:37.357 --> 36:39.324
There are only two guards at the gate.

36:39.391 --> 36:41.924
This task must be
finished tonight, Alpargo.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.424
Tonight it must be finished.

36:43.491 --> 36:44.824
It will, Bey.

36:44.891 --> 36:48.791
Otherwise, the Kayis
will vanish off the face of the earth...

36:48.857 --> 36:51.057
...like a seed in the camel's rumen.

37:30.618 --> 37:36.185
Fire! Fire!

37:38.252 --> 37:40.818
If I am after his position as a Bey...

37:42.285 --> 37:43.418
What is going on?

37:45.152 --> 37:47.485
-No need to panic.
-Why do you care about my panic?

37:48.452 --> 37:50.618
Check out what's
going on, hurry! Come on!

38:07.452 --> 38:08.818
That glorious day has arrived.

38:10.318 --> 38:11.652
That day has arrived.

38:17.718 --> 38:18.785
Hit the drum!

38:20.385 --> 38:23.385
Alps! Surround the tent!

38:23.452 --> 38:24.518
Hurry up!

38:25.818 --> 38:27.385
Surround the tent!

38:30.752 --> 38:32.085
God damn it!

38:41.285 --> 38:42.285
Move!

39:01.718 --> 39:02.718
Sister!

39:05.052 --> 39:06.052
What is going on?

39:08.218 --> 39:10.418
God's justice has delayed again, Gokce.

39:18.052 --> 39:19.752
There is a fire in one of the stables.

39:19.818 --> 39:23.085
-Which one?
-The one near the merchant's tent.

39:24.085 --> 39:26.318
Be careful Rahman. This may be a trap.

39:27.252 --> 39:28.452
Aye, Bey!

39:43.352 --> 39:45.218
Where on earth did this fire come from?

39:46.152 --> 39:47.352
The drums roll.

39:48.152 --> 39:51.585
We can not attack the marquee anymore.
Everybody is alert now.

39:53.485 --> 39:56.118
Get rid of your Alp uniforms.
Hide the weapons too.

39:57.318 --> 39:58.752
Help them put out the fire.

39:58.818 --> 40:00.452
We must not draw attention.

40:00.518 --> 40:01.818
Aye, sir!

40:08.618 --> 40:10.085
God damn it!

40:17.285 --> 40:18.352
Bey!

40:19.485 --> 40:21.318
I smell a rat, Kurdoglu.

40:22.185 --> 40:23.685
Put all the Alps in alert.

40:24.318 --> 40:26.652
Tell them to secure
the nomad tents in full fig.

40:26.718 --> 40:27.718
Aye, Bey!

40:38.452 --> 40:39.818
Bloody oldster!

41:10.218 --> 41:11.418
What happened?

41:12.685 --> 41:16.485
-The fire ruined everything.
-How can a fire break out in this weather?

41:21.518 --> 41:22.618
Dundar.

41:25.252 --> 41:26.852
Suleyman's son Dundar?

41:29.585 --> 41:30.718
He should have died.

41:33.052 --> 41:36.118
What are you talking about, Titus?

41:57.418 --> 41:58.752
Did you hear that?

42:03.185 --> 42:04.485
The hounds of hell.

42:05.552 --> 42:06.618
They are coming.

42:07.852 --> 42:09.785
Their voices are the same as my brothers.

42:11.485 --> 42:12.685
Sooner or later...

42:13.485 --> 42:15.252
...they will perceive your smell.

42:15.752 --> 42:17.385
Shut up, you evil woman!

42:20.518 --> 42:23.385
Not only will they chew
your meat to pieces...

42:25.718 --> 42:26.818
...they will also...

42:28.185 --> 42:31.085
...chew your brain and soul
to pieces with their sharp teeth.

42:36.552 --> 42:37.552
I can feel it.

42:40.118 --> 42:41.152
Here.

42:42.785 --> 42:44.785
They are also here, even in this dargah.

42:47.452 --> 42:49.485
I can feel them revolving around us.

42:53.718 --> 42:55.085
They will find you.

42:56.318 --> 42:57.518
And when they do...

42:58.785 --> 42:59.785
...they will throw...

43:01.318 --> 43:05.685
...your amputated body into the pits of
hell for the eternal torment waiting you.

43:07.152 --> 43:09.118
You cannot escape
from the hounds of hell.

43:10.352 --> 43:12.052
There is no escape from them, Turk!

43:13.252 --> 43:14.252
No escape!

43:21.852 --> 43:23.085
If we die...

43:23.585 --> 43:26.352
...shall my white bearded
father's place be in heaven.

43:27.851 --> 43:30.318
Shall my white haired
mother's place be the skies.

43:32.452 --> 43:34.685
As long as the
God's gift of hope survives...

43:35.652 --> 43:41.085
...God shall not let us go astray.
You pity your sinister fate.

44:25.152 --> 44:26.185
Bey...

44:26.652 --> 44:28.085
...have you seen Dundar?

44:29.152 --> 44:31.385
-Isn't he in his bed?
-No.

44:32.252 --> 44:33.818
Maybe he went out for the fire.

44:36.418 --> 44:38.085
But his bed is untouched.

44:41.185 --> 44:42.418
Rahman!

44:47.052 --> 44:48.618
-Yes, Bey!
-Have you seen Dundar?

44:51.418 --> 44:53.118
I asked if you have seen Dundar!

44:54.418 --> 44:56.485
He went out to meet with his friends.

44:57.385 --> 45:01.585
What do you mean he went out at this
time of the night without my permission?

45:02.552 --> 45:04.152
I thought, he is a young man...

45:04.218 --> 45:06.685
He went out suddenly
so I just couldn't say anything.

45:06.752 --> 45:09.152
Oh God! God give me patience!

45:10.385 --> 45:12.185
Find him immediately! Bring him here!

45:15.685 --> 45:17.385
Why are you so anxious, mother?

45:17.452 --> 45:19.052
It is just a fire in the stable.

45:21.152 --> 45:23.518
Does a fire break out
in the stable in the winter?

45:24.752 --> 45:27.685
-Obviously, somebody did it.
-Who would do such a thing?

45:27.752 --> 45:30.352
Don't you know
the situation we are in Selcan?

45:32.285 --> 45:34.818
Can't you see that they are
trying hard to intrigue us?

45:37.652 --> 45:39.485
-I shall go and have a look.
-Bey...

45:40.785 --> 45:42.052
...be careful, will you?

45:53.518 --> 45:54.752
Dundar! Dundar!

45:55.718 --> 45:58.518
Son, son!

45:59.785 --> 46:00.818
Bey!

46:08.185 --> 46:09.618
-Son!
-Dundar!

46:09.685 --> 46:10.685
My Dundar!

46:17.485 --> 46:18.785
My son!

46:22.418 --> 46:23.485
Dundar, my son!

46:27.552 --> 46:29.052
I am going to call Akcakoca.

47:17.618 --> 47:19.218
What do you want Kara Toygar?

47:20.785 --> 47:24.318
We both want the same thing, Afsin.

47:25.785 --> 47:28.052
We have a mutual goal with you now.

47:28.618 --> 47:30.785
We can never have a mutual goal with you.

47:32.785 --> 47:34.785
It does not look that way to me, Afsin.

47:35.685 --> 47:39.685
I know everything, my former
comrade in arms. Everything.

47:41.285 --> 47:42.652
And so does Sultan.

47:44.518 --> 47:45.585
We know...

47:46.418 --> 47:52.552
...everything you went
through since the first day...

47:53.452 --> 47:57.052
...Ertugrul came in the presence
of El Aziz's Governor Sahabettin.

50:25.152 --> 50:26.818
Who might have done this, Atabey?

50:29.518 --> 50:32.385
I found Dundar near
the hayloft which was on fire.

50:33.085 --> 50:34.352
He might have started it.

50:35.485 --> 50:37.152
What does this mean?

50:37.218 --> 50:38.552
Do you hear what you say?

50:40.318 --> 50:44.318
In my opinion, he sacrificed himself
in order to save the nomad tent.

50:45.818 --> 50:50.652
He might have wanted to
warn us to prevent another danger.

50:53.518 --> 50:54.752
Rahman!

50:59.785 --> 51:00.785
Yes, Bey!

51:00.852 --> 51:03.252
Bring merchant Ebu Hisham to me! Now!

51:08.418 --> 51:10.685
If it weren’t for Ertugrul...

51:11.785 --> 51:15.818
...I would give way to the Templars
who were trying to settle in Konya.

51:17.652 --> 51:21.352
In that case they would
all be under my patronage.

51:22.552 --> 51:25.152
Mine and Sultan Alaaddin's.

51:26.685 --> 51:30.785
Yes, you have spoilt
both mine and the Sultan's game.

51:34.518 --> 51:39.185
They would be leaking information
to their emperor and the Pope...

51:39.252 --> 51:41.452
...by the help of pigeons...

51:42.185 --> 51:45.818
....but only as much as we wanted them to.

51:50.085 --> 51:54.318
But the swarthy young man
of Kayis spoilt our game.

51:56.252 --> 51:57.652
And you helped him.

51:58.385 --> 52:00.585
I do not feel like
believing you, Kara Toygar.

52:02.151 --> 52:07.118
I do not care a bit that
you believe me or not, Afsin.

52:08.785 --> 52:10.518
We are both after the same thing.

52:12.151 --> 52:13.151
What is it?

52:14.385 --> 52:19.552
We both know that El Aziz's
and Halime Sultan's marriage...

52:21.552 --> 52:23.652
...would start a new Turkmen riot.

52:26.185 --> 52:30.752
Nasir and the Templars
would use the Shahzade.

52:33.652 --> 52:37.252
Anyone who loves their state
would approve of this...

52:38.152 --> 52:42.552
...while the Crusaders and
the Mongols are at the door.

52:59.085 --> 53:00.085
Bey.

53:00.752 --> 53:02.818
Suleyman Shah is looking for Ebu Hisham.

53:05.685 --> 53:06.852
You go out, Alpargo.

53:17.385 --> 53:19.352
Do you think the oldster has found out?

53:20.685 --> 53:23.285
He is the most dangerous man
you can ever meet.

53:23.818 --> 53:24.818
What shall we do?

53:25.418 --> 53:27.585
If you run away, he will find you.

53:29.452 --> 53:32.152
You are nothing compared to 100 Alps.

53:32.718 --> 53:34.218
He will skin you alive.

53:39.052 --> 53:40.085
Wait.

54:06.652 --> 54:08.418
You helped them extinguish the fire.

54:10.385 --> 54:11.852
Then I came and took you.

54:20.385 --> 54:21.785
Kurdoglu.

54:21.852 --> 54:25.685
If his cub hasn't died,
that means we are all in deep trouble.

54:26.785 --> 54:29.318
If the boy speaks,
it will be disastrous for us.

54:48.085 --> 54:49.318
Come on, let's go.

55:39.485 --> 55:41.218
I heard you were looking for me.

55:44.385 --> 55:46.118
The hayloft which was on fire...

55:46.718 --> 55:49.318
...is near your men's tent Ebu Hisham.

55:50.685 --> 55:51.685
Yes, Bey.

55:53.152 --> 55:55.352
It was too late when we saw the fire.

55:56.418 --> 56:00.085
They went to bed early because we
would hit the road early in the morning.

56:00.152 --> 56:04.452
When they woke up with the noise, they
immediately tried to extinguish the fire.

56:04.518 --> 56:06.352
I also did what I could do about it.

56:07.518 --> 56:11.085
And did you notice anything suspicious?

56:15.618 --> 56:16.718
No, Bey.

56:18.418 --> 56:19.485
Bey.

56:21.052 --> 56:25.685
A timber fell on Ebu Hisham while
he was trying to extinguish the fire.

56:26.352 --> 56:29.252
If you excuse us,
I will take him to Akcakoca.

56:29.318 --> 56:32.218
-Akcakoca is here, Kurdoglu.
-Hope nothing's bad, Bey?

56:33.418 --> 56:37.285
-Somebody attempted to kill Dundar.
-What are you talking about, Bey?

56:38.518 --> 56:40.618
It was Dundar who set the hayloft on fire.

56:41.585 --> 56:43.752
He saved the nomad tent
from a big disaster.

56:49.718 --> 56:51.118
May God heal him.

56:52.085 --> 56:53.285
He shall get better soon.

56:54.218 --> 56:55.518
Is there anything we can do?

56:56.552 --> 57:01.152
I am sorry to say that I have had your
belongings searched as a precaution.

57:04.618 --> 57:07.118
A servant's precautions
are recognised by God, Bey.

57:07.618 --> 57:10.418
No need to apologize.
Put your mind at ease.

57:11.552 --> 57:13.318
You did what needed to be done.

57:14.385 --> 57:16.585
Leave the nomad tent
immediately with your men.

57:17.452 --> 57:19.052
We are expecting an attack.

57:19.618 --> 57:23.252
I will not feel comfortable
unless I provide your security.

57:25.285 --> 57:27.785
May God bless you
for considering our well-being.

57:28.585 --> 57:30.318
However you please.

57:42.685 --> 57:44.618
-Kurdoglu.
-Yes, Bey?

57:45.352 --> 57:47.218
Get some men to chase them.

57:48.418 --> 57:52.752
They shall follow their every step.
Tell them not to get too close to them.

57:53.518 --> 57:54.518
Aye, Bey!

58:14.785 --> 58:16.085
Gokce.

58:23.118 --> 58:24.418
Thank you Mother Hayme.

58:34.752 --> 58:37.218
I know you want to know
what I am going to say.

58:39.852 --> 58:42.518
Our boy Dundar is young, strong.

58:43.785 --> 58:45.818
He is at the exact age
to become an Alp.

58:46.618 --> 58:50.085
He is strong as stone, God bless.

58:50.785 --> 58:55.285
We believe deep in our hearts
that God almighty will provide remedy...

58:55.352 --> 58:57.052
...and we must pray for this.

58:59.685 --> 59:01.218
The sword impact he took...

59:02.352 --> 59:06.285
...may not be lethal...

59:08.185 --> 59:12.652
...but there is another
matter that concerns me.

59:16.518 --> 59:18.818
The blow he took when he fell.

59:20.452 --> 59:23.118
That is my major concern.

59:25.618 --> 59:27.152
What do you mean, Akcakoca?

59:29.318 --> 59:30.418
Briefly...

59:31.852 --> 59:35.285
...his body can endure
the sword's impact.

59:37.285 --> 59:38.618
But...

59:41.685 --> 59:43.585
But his brain...

59:48.652 --> 59:50.285
...his brain...

59:50.752 --> 59:52.052
Akcakoca.

59:53.085 --> 59:55.852
Just say it.
So let us all know.

00:59:59.118 --> 01:00:00.818
The impact he took on the head...

01:00:03.118 --> 01:00:07.252
...may have damaged his mental skills.

01:00:13.685 --> 01:00:17.418
Perhaps, from now on, our son Dundar...

01:00:19.352 --> 01:00:26.085
...may have a long and painful life
to suffer while sleeping to death.

01:00:44.652 --> 01:00:48.652
His Highness Halebi went to Aleppo.
The dargah is leaderless now.

01:00:50.318 --> 01:00:53.185
We shall complete
this task today whatever it takes.

01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:58.218
Lives of the dervishes' in the dargah
are at stake because of us.

01:00:58.685 --> 01:01:02.385
We cannot handle if anything happens
to the dervishes because of us.

01:01:02.452 --> 01:01:05.052
What would we say to Ibn'ul Arabi then?

01:01:05.118 --> 01:01:06.285
Shall we...

01:01:09.385 --> 01:01:10.452
Ertugrul?

01:01:11.452 --> 01:01:13.218
We have to go immediately, brother.

01:01:13.818 --> 01:01:14.818
You are not coming.

01:01:16.518 --> 01:01:18.052
Brother, don't do this.

01:01:18.118 --> 01:01:20.685
Ertugrul, they will not
let you in the palace.

01:01:21.418 --> 01:01:23.718
And if they do,
they will not let you out.

01:01:25.252 --> 01:01:27.085
It is better if I go as an ambassador.

01:01:34.352 --> 01:01:35.785
What happened in the palace?

01:01:55.385 --> 01:01:56.852
That spoiled brat Dundar...

01:01:58.352 --> 01:01:59.352
...ruined everything.

01:02:00.252 --> 01:02:01.618
He warned the nomad group...

01:02:01.685 --> 01:02:05.218
...by putting the hayloft on fire.
He is just like his Brother Ertugrul.

01:02:06.518 --> 01:02:10.285
I will come back again,
Kurdoglu, to finish this business off.

01:02:12.385 --> 01:02:13.618
Dundar must die.

01:02:16.218 --> 01:02:17.352
If he speaks...

01:02:18.185 --> 01:02:20.252
...it will be your job
to kill Suleyman Shah.

01:02:22.118 --> 01:02:25.218
And as far as I see,
you are not strong enough to do it.

01:02:26.052 --> 01:02:27.118
What about El Aziz?

01:02:27.685 --> 01:02:30.852
-His army is about to hit the road.
-I did whatever I could.

01:02:31.085 --> 01:02:34.252
You should do whatever
it takes to stop El Aziz's army!

01:02:34.318 --> 01:02:36.285
I hope your Bey agrees to surrender.

01:02:46.252 --> 01:02:48.518
Have a blessed day, my Brother Kurdoglu.

01:02:49.318 --> 01:02:51.185
May God speed you, Ebu Hisham.

01:04:02.618 --> 01:04:06.352
My daughter, more beautiful
than the moon, crazier than me.

01:04:06.418 --> 01:04:08.785
My brave daughter who took her weapons...

01:04:08.852 --> 01:04:11.485
...to go after her man,
the nightmare of the cowardly.

01:04:12.152 --> 01:04:15.152
-Welcome!
-Glad to be back. Father...

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:18.052
...I located where Turgut is being held.

01:04:18.518 --> 01:04:19.785
Did you go there, daughter?

01:04:20.718 --> 01:04:22.052
I did, father.

01:04:23.218 --> 01:04:26.085
All right, daughter.
Let's go to our Bey now...

01:04:26.152 --> 01:04:27.585
...and tell him what you know.

01:04:45.452 --> 01:04:46.452
<i>Permission.</i>

01:04:51.585 --> 01:04:53.352
I have been waiting for you to come.

01:04:54.318 --> 01:04:56.218
I saw how you were waiting for me...

01:04:56.285 --> 01:04:58.252
...to tell to tell you everything.

01:04:59.518 --> 01:05:03.452
This is what you get if you collaborate
with men who cannot even kill a kid.

01:05:03.518 --> 01:05:08.585
We are trying to to harvest the crops
without getting our feet in the mud.

01:05:09.618 --> 01:05:14.452
Get your feet in the mud then!
Get in it up to the neck!

01:05:14.518 --> 01:05:17.218
At that case you will feel my support.

01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:19.485
So that is how much you trust me?

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:24.485
We share the same destiny now, Kurdoglu.

01:05:25.718 --> 01:05:30.485
We will get what we want or they will
have our dead bodies eaten by vultures.

01:05:33.352 --> 01:05:36.385
Ebu Hisham will come back again.

01:05:37.652 --> 01:05:39.452
What is his self-interest in this?

01:05:39.518 --> 01:05:41.385
We are practising on the same target.

01:05:42.385 --> 01:05:43.552
Be careful, Kurdoglu...

01:05:44.285 --> 01:05:47.852
...for the arrow you shot shall not
turn back and strike you in the buttocks.

01:05:49.685 --> 01:05:51.485
It is time for you to leave.

01:05:51.552 --> 01:05:54.385
Aykiz has arrived.
I shall listen what she has to say.

01:06:17.318 --> 01:06:18.418
Alpargo!

01:06:18.485 --> 01:06:19.485
Yes, Bey?

01:06:19.552 --> 01:06:22.385
Take two men and go after him.
Do not get too close to him.

01:06:22.818 --> 01:06:26.185
Ebu Hisham knows that
you will be following him with two Alps.

01:06:26.852 --> 01:06:30.118
Return without arousing
the suspicions of Alps coming with you.

01:06:30.185 --> 01:06:31.785
Suleyman will interrogate them too.

01:06:31.852 --> 01:06:33.752
If he finds out that this is a plot...

01:06:34.485 --> 01:06:36.785
He suspected Ebu Hisham for once.

01:06:36.852 --> 01:06:40.852
That bloody oldster would not
stop until he solves this in his head.

01:06:42.052 --> 01:06:43.052
Now go!

01:06:46.218 --> 01:06:50.252
I saw that the Templars' castle is
impenetrable even with a massive army.

01:06:51.318 --> 01:06:54.718
Like the Assassins' castle in Alamut?

01:06:54.785 --> 01:06:56.185
Yes, Bey.

01:06:57.585 --> 01:07:00.585
The real evil is in Alamut, Bey.

01:07:01.552 --> 01:07:03.685
That demon is called Hassan al-Sabbah.

01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:10.585
It was that demon's men who murdered
Alp Arslan and his son Malik Shah.

01:07:11.552 --> 01:07:16.552
Those Templars learned
everything they know from them.

01:07:18.718 --> 01:07:22.618
One of them poison the Muslims
by putting idolatry in the book of God...

01:07:23.652 --> 01:07:28.185
...and the others poison the Christians
with what they have learned from them.

01:07:28.685 --> 01:07:32.685
One is no better than the other.

01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:36.652
That castle can only
be accessed with a trick.

01:07:36.718 --> 01:07:40.818
We must discover that trick and enter
that castle as quickly as possible, Bey.

01:07:41.052 --> 01:07:44.818
If Turgut is still in that castle,
it is our duty to go and rescue him.

01:07:48.252 --> 01:07:50.552
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS
THE TEMPLARS' CASTLE

01:09:06.185 --> 01:09:07.818
A willpower strong as steel.

01:09:09.452 --> 01:09:15.618
If I had 10 knights like you,
Jerusalem would have been ours already.

01:09:26.085 --> 01:09:28.585
From now on I will call you Judas.

01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:34.152
Your name among us will be Judas.

01:09:36.385 --> 01:09:37.552
Judas.

01:09:39.452 --> 01:09:43.418
I am giving you the name
of the apostle who betrayed Jesus.

01:09:44.618 --> 01:09:47.085
In order for you
to never forget who you are.

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:50.085
Judas.

01:09:53.718 --> 01:09:55.118
Get him ready.

01:09:56.785 --> 01:10:00.752
I will show
our new knight around the castle.

01:10:47.418 --> 01:10:48.752
May God curse your hands.

01:10:50.718 --> 01:10:52.518
What was your problem with this kid?

01:11:03.585 --> 01:11:05.752
What did Akcakoca say, Mother Hayme?

01:11:08.552 --> 01:11:11.285
He said that his wounds would heal slowly.

01:11:12.752 --> 01:11:14.218
He said he was young...

01:11:15.385 --> 01:11:16.485
...and strong.

01:11:26.852 --> 01:11:28.052
Mother Hayme.

01:11:31.285 --> 01:11:32.285
But...

01:11:33.618 --> 01:11:34.618
...but...

01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:39.685
...till the end of his life...

01:12:47.252 --> 01:12:48.852
I have a request Mother Hafza.

01:12:50.485 --> 01:12:52.385
I am listening to you, Ertugrul Bey.

01:13:02.085 --> 01:13:03.518
The palace nanny, Ummul Hayr...

01:13:04.418 --> 01:13:08.052
...is the sister of your husband Halebi.
You visit the palace frequently.

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:11.252
Can you tell Halime Sultan...

01:13:11.318 --> 01:13:14.785
...that I would like to talk to her
and bring her to the carpet shop?

01:13:15.652 --> 01:13:17.318
This is very dangerous.

01:13:17.385 --> 01:13:19.718
Not only for you
but also for that girl.

01:13:21.785 --> 01:13:22.785
I know.

01:13:30.385 --> 01:13:31.452
But...

01:13:32.252 --> 01:13:35.652
...if I cannot talk to her
it will be a disaster for all of us.

01:13:38.485 --> 01:13:40.152
I will go to the palace for you.

01:13:41.252 --> 01:13:43.785
But if she does not want to come...

01:13:44.452 --> 01:13:45.785
...I cannot force her.

01:13:47.085 --> 01:13:48.718
God bless you, Mother Hafza.

01:13:50.785 --> 01:13:52.218
Now excuse me.

01:14:32.785 --> 01:14:34.652
Why did you do this, sister?

01:14:36.552 --> 01:14:39.785
Are you aware of the difficulties
he dealt with just for you, for us?

01:14:41.485 --> 01:14:45.485
Are you aware how Brother Turgut
suffers in the dungeon for saving us?

01:14:46.685 --> 01:14:48.385
How could you do this, sister?

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:50.618
I had to, Yigit.

01:14:52.052 --> 01:14:53.585
For you, for my father...

01:14:53.652 --> 01:14:56.618
I wish you had let them
kill me with Brother Turgut.

01:14:58.218 --> 01:14:59.752
I beg you, do not speak like that.

01:14:59.818 --> 01:15:01.685
Do you know what you did, sister?

01:15:03.085 --> 01:15:04.518
You killed Brother Ertugrul.

01:16:01.086 --> 01:16:06.386
Believe it or not, Halime Sultan.

01:16:07.919 --> 01:16:09.653
The destiny is such a thing.

01:16:10.486 --> 01:16:12.153
What the hell are you doing here?

01:16:13.953 --> 01:16:17.819
I came to rescue you from
the bed of that idiot El Aziz.

01:16:20.386 --> 01:16:23.153
I am your only friend
in this palace, Halime.

01:16:26.019 --> 01:16:28.119
You are a despicable blood-shedder!

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:06.619
Welcome to your home, Titus.

01:17:10.653 --> 01:17:14.086
I learned what happened, sir.
I must go to Aleppo immediately.

01:17:15.119 --> 01:17:17.619
We all are under threat
while Eftelya is alive.

01:17:19.086 --> 01:17:22.486
If her identity is revealed,
we will lose Aleppo.

01:17:23.619 --> 01:17:26.019
I have always been proud of you, Titus.

01:17:27.019 --> 01:17:29.919
I am glad that you infiltrated the Kayis.

01:17:33.119 --> 01:17:35.653
Has the Cardinal completed the report...

01:17:35.719 --> 01:17:38.619
...he has been preparing
for the Pope and Emperor Frederick?

01:17:39.453 --> 01:17:40.453
No.

01:17:43.419 --> 01:17:44.719
Or he is lying to me.

01:17:46.519 --> 01:17:49.019
This task will be harder
than I thought, Titus.

01:17:50.853 --> 01:17:56.353
If necessary, the Cardinal
may have to die by a Muslim's sword...

01:17:56.453 --> 01:17:59.153
...like my brother Giovanni.

01:18:01.453 --> 01:18:02.586
Do you understand me?

01:18:05.886 --> 01:18:06.886
Titus...

01:18:07.719 --> 01:18:12.053
...as you depart, take the gift
I had prepared for El Aziz with you.

01:18:14.153 --> 01:18:16.886
It will be
the bloodiest wedding in history.

01:18:19.353 --> 01:18:22.786
I wish I was one of the guests.

01:18:24.486 --> 01:18:26.586
I will represent you
as good as possible, sir.

01:18:26.986 --> 01:18:29.153
I have no doubt about it, Titus.

01:18:30.586 --> 01:18:31.753
No doubt whatsoever!

01:19:05.419 --> 01:19:06.986
What is Kara Toygar doing here?

01:19:07.786 --> 01:19:10.519
Aleaddin must have learned
that you are going to marry...

01:19:10.653 --> 01:19:11.953
...the Shahzade's daughter.

01:19:12.519 --> 01:19:17.786
And to prevent it
, he sent his one eyed monster, sir.

01:19:22.653 --> 01:19:24.653
Sir, be prepared for the threats.

01:19:25.053 --> 01:19:26.453
Do not surrender.

01:19:30.053 --> 01:19:31.519
What shall I do, Nasir?

01:19:32.153 --> 01:19:34.853
Send him away immediately
from the court, sir.

01:19:36.853 --> 01:19:40.919
And marry Halime Sultan without
waiting for the wedding preparations.

01:19:42.686 --> 01:19:45.819
-You hold the wedding later on.
-Would it be convenient that way?

01:19:46.953 --> 01:19:48.753
Helter-skelter without a wedding?

01:19:49.153 --> 01:19:52.786
Would it beseem well for a ruler like me
and a Shahzade's daughter like her?

01:19:52.853 --> 01:19:57.486
Sir, if the security of our state is at
stake, of course it would beseem well.

01:20:06.819 --> 01:20:11.719
So glad I have you, Nasir.
May God keep you with me.

01:20:20.586 --> 01:20:22.153
The Kayis have sent an ambassador.

01:20:22.386 --> 01:20:24.653
We are keeping him
waiting at the palace gate.

01:20:33.986 --> 01:20:35.086
Bamsi Beyrek!

01:20:35.686 --> 01:20:38.019
Enough! Sit down I am feeling dizzy!

01:20:38.586 --> 01:20:40.686
These women are all the same!

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:42.886
Has not a mother given birth to you?

01:20:42.953 --> 01:20:45.919
Leave my mother out of this!
I am talking about sister Halime!

01:20:47.019 --> 01:20:50.386
She was like that in the marquee
now she is like this in the palace!

01:20:51.553 --> 01:20:53.453
She sold Ertugrul Bey out!

01:20:53.519 --> 01:20:55.453
Shut up! Bey will hear.

01:20:56.019 --> 01:20:57.019
Oh God!

01:20:57.819 --> 01:20:59.919
I am not going to forgive her till I die.

01:20:59.986 --> 01:21:02.519
Oh my!
This is a trick sister Halime is playing.

01:21:22.819 --> 01:21:23.819
What a shame.

01:21:27.953 --> 01:21:30.453
After all the trouble you
have gone through for her.

01:21:32.586 --> 01:21:33.653
You put yourself...

01:21:34.453 --> 01:21:35.553
...your Alps...

01:21:37.119 --> 01:21:38.519
...your nomad group...

01:21:38.786 --> 01:21:40.386
...at risk for her.

01:21:43.519 --> 01:21:45.086
You even stood up against us.

01:21:51.586 --> 01:21:53.019
Who are you talking about?

01:21:54.753 --> 01:21:56.353
About that Shahzade's daughter.

01:21:57.419 --> 01:21:59.019
About Halime Sultan.

01:22:05.919 --> 01:22:07.353
Did you really think...

01:22:09.353 --> 01:22:12.586
...a Shahzade's daughter would
fall in love with a shepherd like you?

01:22:17.086 --> 01:22:21.119
She used you Ertugrul.
She made you come this far.

01:22:23.153 --> 01:22:25.619
And when she found
an Ameer as noble as herself...

01:22:27.786 --> 01:22:29.386
...she went to bed with him.

01:22:32.553 --> 01:22:34.086
You are getting angry with me...

01:22:35.686 --> 01:22:39.453
...but I knew things would end up this way
when you brought her to the palace.

01:22:43.453 --> 01:22:44.519
Do you know...

01:22:46.853 --> 01:22:49.419
...I was the woman
who El Aziz was in love with.

01:22:49.986 --> 01:22:51.119
I was his favourite.

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:55.653
I know his tastes very good.

01:22:59.153 --> 01:23:01.086
Halime is exactly how he desires.

01:23:09.619 --> 01:23:11.353
He used to write poems for me.

01:23:14.386 --> 01:23:17.619
For Christ's sake, I had to endure
those horrible poems everyday.

01:23:24.386 --> 01:23:26.019
Now Halime Sultan will take my place.

01:23:31.753 --> 01:23:37.019
He will find solace in Halime's young
and tender skin during long Aleppo nights.

01:23:43.353 --> 01:23:45.519
I have never hit
a woman in my entire life.

01:23:45.586 --> 01:23:47.753
God forbid that
I should experience such shame!

01:23:48.086 --> 01:23:50.686
A man of honour would
never do something like that.

01:23:51.419 --> 01:23:55.786
But you should keep this in mind
that whenever I remember you...

01:23:56.519 --> 01:23:58.786
...I will pray for you to burn in hell.

01:23:58.853 --> 01:24:01.486
Not only will I pray
for the lives you have taken...

01:24:01.553 --> 01:24:06.819
...but also for your lies and slanders
to be the fire you puke in hell.

01:24:43.419 --> 01:24:45.153
The son of Suleyman Shah, Gundogdu Bey!

01:25:08.719 --> 01:25:10.853
I said I wanted to meet you alone.

01:25:18.686 --> 01:25:21.419
Nasir is the most certified
person in this city after me.

01:25:24.019 --> 01:25:28.153
Not only have I entrusted him my life
and the pudicity of my harem...

01:25:29.586 --> 01:25:30.886
...but also my city.

01:25:34.119 --> 01:25:37.886
Who are you to feel disturbed
by his presence here?

01:25:40.486 --> 01:25:44.386
I can not get out of trouble since
I annexed your nomad tent anyway.

01:25:45.586 --> 01:25:49.619
And you stand there and tell me
what I should do unashamedly!

01:25:51.053 --> 01:25:52.053
Shame!

01:25:52.786 --> 01:25:56.553
So you deserve to experience
the biggest betrayal possible.

01:25:58.153 --> 01:26:03.053
You have already sold this city which
is one of the most beautiful cities...

01:26:03.119 --> 01:26:06.019
...Saladin Ayyubid's dynasty
has established to the infidels.

01:26:06.086 --> 01:26:07.519
How dare you...

01:26:07.586 --> 01:26:08.786
Your Highness The Ameer.

01:26:11.353 --> 01:26:13.086
Let him speak, Your Highness The Ameer.

01:26:13.886 --> 01:26:17.853
As you said before, it is necessary
to deal with this unpleasant matter...

01:26:17.953 --> 01:26:20.853
...without shedding any
Muslim blood by the religious means...

01:26:20.919 --> 01:26:22.819
...and also for a clear conscience.

01:26:25.519 --> 01:26:26.553
Well...

01:26:27.619 --> 01:26:31.919
...although I am suspicious about
the faith of this inconsiderate party...

01:26:32.019 --> 01:26:33.019
Nasir...

01:26:34.753 --> 01:26:38.353
Once upon a time there was this Seljuk
commander who had betrayed his state.

01:26:39.819 --> 01:26:44.053
The last time I saw him he was barking
like dogs in the center of our nomad tent.

01:26:44.786 --> 01:26:48.019
It is such a shame that
you won't have the time for that.

01:26:49.019 --> 01:26:52.953
His Highness The Ameer will soon
find out who you really are...

01:26:53.686 --> 01:26:55.953
...how you have infiltrated the palace...

01:26:56.519 --> 01:26:59.386
...and how you have been
taking orders from the Templars.

01:26:59.453 --> 01:27:00.453
Enough!

01:27:01.786 --> 01:27:03.753
If you are an ambassador,
behave like one!

01:27:07.019 --> 01:27:08.753
Or regardless of the regulations...

01:27:08.819 --> 01:27:11.153
...I will have your head
cut off from your body.

01:27:12.353 --> 01:27:13.353
Sir.

01:27:13.986 --> 01:27:16.919
You shall talk.
I can wait for you outside.

01:28:02.719 --> 01:28:03.753
It is a lie!

01:28:04.019 --> 01:28:06.053
You won't deceive me with those slanders.

01:28:06.553 --> 01:28:08.153
If you have any courage...

01:28:09.519 --> 01:28:14.086
...you find out the truth about the woman
named Eftelya who calls herself as Esma.

01:28:15.119 --> 01:28:16.853
The only thing I want from you...

01:28:17.353 --> 01:28:21.019
...is your permission to bring her
together with Leyla's nanny to you.

01:28:21.086 --> 01:28:23.153
What is my nanny got to do with this?

01:28:23.386 --> 01:28:26.619
She informed against Ertugrul
and got him put in the dungeon.

01:28:26.686 --> 01:28:28.519
She loves you as if you are her son.

01:28:28.586 --> 01:28:32.119
Also she is the one
whom Ertugrul and you both trust.

01:28:34.619 --> 01:28:37.786
Your Highness The Ameer,
she would never betray you.

01:28:39.153 --> 01:28:42.886
She only considers what is
best for you and your sister Leyla.

01:28:43.953 --> 01:28:46.486
And she is one of the three
people in the palace....

01:28:46.586 --> 01:28:49.053
...who know that are not
members of the Templars.

01:28:49.119 --> 01:28:50.486
Who are the other two?

01:28:51.753 --> 01:28:54.153
Your sister Leyla and you.

01:28:59.353 --> 01:29:01.553
You said you could not make Esma speak.

01:29:02.853 --> 01:29:04.586
What if she does not speak again?

01:29:04.653 --> 01:29:06.386
How are you going to prove it out?

01:29:07.686 --> 01:29:11.786
There is a cross tattoo in the back
of her head, hidden under her hair.

01:29:12.653 --> 01:29:13.686
Remember.

01:29:14.086 --> 01:29:17.586
The Templars who came to the palace
to kill Ertugrul had the same thing.

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:19.353
You will see it for yourself.

01:30:27.919 --> 01:30:29.786
All right! Enough girls!

01:30:29.919 --> 01:30:30.986
Leave the girl alone!

01:30:31.619 --> 01:30:33.653
Come on, let the poor girl breathe.

01:30:38.019 --> 01:30:40.519
Come on, come with me.

01:30:48.486 --> 01:30:50.419
You've become so beautiful, God bless.

01:30:53.586 --> 01:30:56.053
El Aziz is more than a son for me, Halime.

01:30:56.953 --> 01:30:57.986
Get used to him.

01:30:58.786 --> 01:31:00.653
You will see, you will love him.

01:31:02.786 --> 01:31:04.119
He has a heart of gold.

01:31:05.853 --> 01:31:07.719
He is respectful, polite.

01:31:08.419 --> 01:31:09.886
He values women a lot.

01:31:11.719 --> 01:31:18.719
You will experience the pleasure of
being loved and pampered with him.

01:31:20.719 --> 01:31:23.086
Just give him the opportunity,
give him some time.

01:31:26.686 --> 01:31:27.853
I saw Kara Toygar.

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:34.086
Do you know
what he is doing in the palace?

01:31:35.953 --> 01:31:38.019
The Seljuk Sultan Aleaddin Keykubat...

01:31:38.086 --> 01:31:42.553
...has sent him
as an ambassador to consult with El Aziz.

01:31:43.686 --> 01:31:44.853
Consult about what?

01:31:46.686 --> 01:31:48.853
Your marriage with El Aziz.

01:31:51.853 --> 01:31:56.386
They say that the Sultan sent him
in person to prevent this marriage.

01:31:59.519 --> 01:32:00.553
I see.

01:32:09.086 --> 01:32:14.086
Being wordy is not a reliable behaviour,
Your Highness The Ameer.

01:32:16.019 --> 01:32:17.686
Let me get straight to the point.

01:32:19.153 --> 01:32:22.019
If you marry our Shahzade's daughter...

01:32:23.353 --> 01:32:25.153
...we will assume that...

01:32:26.886 --> 01:32:28.653
...you are willing to encourage...

01:32:29.353 --> 01:32:33.353
...the Turkmen people to start a riot
by collaborating with the Shahzade.

01:32:39.819 --> 01:32:41.753
Are you threatening us Kara Toygar?

01:32:44.419 --> 01:32:49.519
Only the weak nebbishes
threaten, Commander Nasir.

01:32:51.486 --> 01:32:55.919
The glorious Sultan
of our state Aleaddin Keykubat...

01:32:57.086 --> 01:32:58.553
...does not threaten.

01:33:00.586 --> 01:33:01.886
He does what is necessary.

01:33:05.086 --> 01:33:10.086
We are in a war with your Sultan Aleaddin
Keykubat every single day, Kara Toygar.

01:33:11.653 --> 01:33:14.619
Not a day passes
without a border violation.

01:33:16.053 --> 01:33:19.553
Not a day passes without a clash
between the soldiers of both sides.

01:33:21.453 --> 01:33:23.119
Come on, Your Highness The Ameer!

01:33:23.853 --> 01:33:25.386
You know that...

01:33:26.419 --> 01:33:31.586
...those are only simple arm wrestling
competitions between two states...

01:33:32.119 --> 01:33:34.419
...by using their armies.

01:33:36.419 --> 01:33:37.653
But this marriage...

01:33:39.419 --> 01:33:40.886
...is not a border game.

01:33:41.919 --> 01:33:44.953
Arm wrestling, not in the least!

01:33:46.986 --> 01:33:50.719
This is definitely a declaration of war!

01:34:22.786 --> 01:34:26.686
Did you really think you would lay around
in the dungeon? You will beg to die!

01:34:27.386 --> 01:34:28.419
Come on!

01:35:27.753 --> 01:35:30.453
So I was going beg to die
in the dungeons of Aleppo, huh?

01:36:00.453 --> 01:36:01.553
Titus!

01:36:05.086 --> 01:36:06.419
Isadora!

01:36:19.486 --> 01:36:24.786
I am so sorry for your sister.
Her suicide affected us all deeply.

01:36:28.553 --> 01:36:29.986
I do not know what to say.

01:36:31.419 --> 01:36:33.586
My sister would never
ever fall into such sin.

01:36:37.686 --> 01:36:38.919
What do you mean?

01:36:45.153 --> 01:36:46.886
How did she die then?

01:36:48.853 --> 01:36:50.619
Is there something you know?

01:36:53.419 --> 01:36:54.686
You loved her, didn't you?

01:36:58.453 --> 01:37:00.586
She used to mention
her feelings about you....

01:37:00.653 --> 01:37:02.353
...in her letters all the time.

01:37:39.619 --> 01:37:44.653
Take one of their swords
if it is going to make you feel safe.

01:38:23.686 --> 01:38:24.786
Do not forget.

01:38:25.919 --> 01:38:28.353
They are your real brothers.

01:39:27.886 --> 01:39:34.553
Here is my chamber, Judas,
where I consult with knights.

01:39:37.619 --> 01:39:43.153
My library which consists of
very precious pieces, is here.

01:39:53.853 --> 01:39:58.686
Isadora! Come, my beautiful niece.

01:40:08.119 --> 01:40:10.553
Let me introduce you to my new knight.

01:40:11.553 --> 01:40:12.553
Judas.

01:40:19.719 --> 01:40:24.553
He will replace
your little prince for some time.

01:40:25.719 --> 01:40:31.053
I want you to take care of him
and teach him what he needs to learn.

01:40:32.053 --> 01:40:34.453
He should learn
our language, for instance.

01:40:35.619 --> 01:40:36.653
To read.

01:40:37.919 --> 01:40:39.419
Is that right, Judas?

01:40:42.886 --> 01:40:44.653
As you wish my dear uncle.

01:40:45.519 --> 01:40:47.653
Take him to the room
where he is going stay.

01:40:48.553 --> 01:40:53.553
Prepare him for his new life,
my beautiful Isadora.

01:41:52.853 --> 01:41:54.086
Peace be upon you.

01:41:55.853 --> 01:42:00.553
I have a carpet loom in Aleppo.
I would like to host you all there gladly.

01:42:42.119 --> 01:42:43.153
Tell me!

01:42:44.386 --> 01:42:45.453
Who am I?

01:42:48.453 --> 01:42:49.586
I do not know.

01:42:50.819 --> 01:42:51.886
So?

01:42:54.053 --> 01:42:55.053
I don't know!

01:43:36.119 --> 01:43:37.486
You want this one?

01:43:53.586 --> 01:43:54.719
Come on, take it.

01:43:58.653 --> 01:43:59.853
I said take it!

01:44:10.353 --> 01:44:11.819
You want to kill me?

01:44:14.119 --> 01:44:15.519
Come on, kill me.

01:44:26.819 --> 01:44:28.119
Enough already!

01:44:31.353 --> 01:44:32.719
End this game, Titus.

01:44:34.486 --> 01:44:35.986
Don't you see, he is unconscious.

01:44:37.719 --> 01:44:40.786
He is not aware of himself
because of the torture he went through.

01:44:44.986 --> 01:44:46.453
I beg you, uncle, please.

01:44:50.019 --> 01:44:51.386
Come on, kill me!

01:44:52.886 --> 01:44:56.553
Or admit that I am your brother.

01:45:05.053 --> 01:45:06.419
Brother?

01:45:07.586 --> 01:45:10.153
Yes, brother.

01:45:13.653 --> 01:45:14.953
We are brothers.

01:45:16.919 --> 01:45:18.619
Brothers.

01:45:19.419 --> 01:45:21.153
My name is Titus.

01:45:45.019 --> 01:45:46.353
Judas.

01:46:02.753 --> 01:46:03.953
Let's go Judas.

01:46:05.686 --> 01:46:06.719
Come on.

01:47:34.919 --> 01:47:36.086
If you hadn't come...

01:47:37.719 --> 01:47:39.919
...you would have
turned my life into hell.

01:47:41.419 --> 01:47:43.153
How could I not come, Ertugrul?

01:47:46.686 --> 01:47:48.919
A baby gazelle sealed our fate.

01:47:50.886 --> 01:47:55.586
And all the countries of the
world swore an oath to separate us.

01:48:03.886 --> 01:48:06.119
I said no when
you asked me to be your wife.

01:48:10.153 --> 01:48:12.819
I couldn't tell you
the pain of it inside me, Ertugrul.

01:48:16.453 --> 01:48:19.119
I sacrificed myself
for my father and brother.

01:48:22.553 --> 01:48:24.786
If you take me from El Aziz's hands...

01:48:26.853 --> 01:48:30.386
...his rage will burn the entire
Kayi nomad tent to ashes, Ertugrul.

01:48:33.986 --> 01:48:35.153
I know everything.

01:48:36.953 --> 01:48:38.586
I was in the palace last night.

01:48:47.386 --> 01:48:49.886
Ertugrul, my father is
compelling me to marry El Aziz.

01:48:53.919 --> 01:48:56.853
But whatever the cost,
I am not going to marry that man.

01:49:00.786 --> 01:49:03.553
I will wait for you, Ertugrul,
till you come and rescue me.

01:49:05.886 --> 01:49:07.086
If I do not come...

01:49:08.619 --> 01:49:09.619
...know that...

01:49:10.419 --> 01:49:12.419
...the grim reaper has taken my life.

01:49:16.753 --> 01:49:19.486
In that case, you should know
that I would also be dead.

01:49:22.819 --> 01:49:25.553
I can neither go to his
bed nor be his woman...

01:49:25.886 --> 01:49:27.853
...with the love I feel for you.

01:49:31.453 --> 01:49:32.686
I can never put a shame...

01:49:32.819 --> 01:49:36.453
...to the memory of the state my
forefather Seljuk Bey established, or you.

01:49:42.553 --> 01:49:43.586
Go now.

01:49:44.019 --> 01:49:46.653
Save your nomad tent
from the hands of those bastards.

01:49:47.086 --> 01:49:48.386
Don't think of me.

01:49:51.786 --> 01:49:53.486
May God speed you Ertugrul.

01:49:56.686 --> 01:49:59.419
My heart will beat
for you until my last breath.

01:50:06.553 --> 01:50:07.619
Halime!

01:50:17.853 --> 01:50:22.619
Neither El Aziz nor the rest of
the world can take you away from me.

01:50:27.119 --> 01:50:29.553
I would never
leave you to those tyrants...

01:50:30.119 --> 01:50:33.719
...or let those tyrants
be Sultans of the world.

01:50:36.853 --> 01:50:38.386
I will come to get you.

01:50:39.653 --> 01:50:40.719
I promise.

01:50:43.419 --> 01:50:45.753
El Aziz said he wouldn't
marry me until the wedding.

01:50:47.753 --> 01:50:49.853
I will be waiting
for you till then, Ertugrul.

01:51:27.986 --> 01:51:29.619
The others must be in there too.

01:51:29.686 --> 01:51:32.019
They ordered more breads
than they usually do.

01:51:40.919 --> 01:51:42.486
Enjoy the gold.

01:51:43.086 --> 01:51:44.419
God bless you, sir.

01:53:31.853 --> 01:53:36.519
Shah, could you please
tell mother to eat something?

01:53:38.019 --> 01:53:40.019
She has not eaten
anything since yesterday.

01:53:42.086 --> 01:53:43.153
I could.

01:53:44.386 --> 01:53:47.753
I could but I am not sure
if she would feel like eating.

01:53:56.386 --> 01:53:57.953
We were going to hold...

01:53:59.686 --> 01:54:03.019
...Ertugrul's and your wedding
by the time we arrived at our new home.

01:54:04.453 --> 01:54:09.119
We would hold and love
our grandchildren on this fertile land.

01:54:12.819 --> 01:54:14.153
Everything is possible, Shah.

01:54:16.153 --> 01:54:18.619
May God grant us
good health, in the first place.

01:54:19.553 --> 01:54:21.853
These bad days will pass, if God permits.

01:54:22.419 --> 01:54:25.086
If God permits, my girl. If God permits...

01:55:24.719 --> 01:55:26.153
<i>These are your good days.</i>

01:55:26.819 --> 01:55:28.686
<i>The worse are yet to come.</i>

01:55:59.853 --> 01:56:01.386
They will kill you all.

01:56:03.686 --> 01:56:04.819
If we get caught...

01:56:05.619 --> 01:56:07.753
...you will die together with us Eftelya.

01:56:08.853 --> 01:56:11.119
But your death won't be
an easy one, Ertugrul.

01:56:12.019 --> 01:56:13.353
You will beg.

01:56:14.786 --> 01:56:17.786
All the streets of Aleppo will
hear you screaming “Kill me!”

01:56:19.586 --> 01:56:22.953
How are those demons to whom
you service like a dog going to kill you?

01:56:24.019 --> 01:56:25.019
Silently?

01:56:26.553 --> 01:56:28.819
Or by watching you foam at the mouth?

01:56:29.419 --> 01:56:31.053
Huh, how?

01:56:33.886 --> 01:56:35.619
How would you like to die, Eftelya?

01:56:36.019 --> 01:56:37.153
Ertugrul!

01:56:37.953 --> 01:56:39.886
Come on, time has come.

01:57:03.919 --> 01:57:05.919
-Is Ertugrul in there too?
-Yes.

01:57:09.486 --> 01:57:10.653
You wait here, Titus.

01:57:12.119 --> 01:57:13.353
Nasir.

01:57:15.353 --> 01:57:16.853
Don't you ever tell me what to do!

01:57:18.153 --> 01:57:19.353
Ever!

01:57:28.686 --> 01:57:31.019
This dargah has teeth on El Aziz.

01:57:32.553 --> 01:57:33.919
Also on Ibn-ul Arabi.

01:57:34.853 --> 01:57:39.453
I want this power replaced with the gold
you are going to bring and my army.

01:57:39.586 --> 01:57:42.553
I will demolish this dargah
together with everything inside it.

01:57:43.419 --> 01:57:45.753
I can not find an opportunity
better than this one.

01:57:59.318 --> 01:58:02.318
Whatever the cost,
there is no turning back, brother.

01:58:03.451 --> 01:58:05.618
We will not stop
even if there are casualties.

01:58:05.684 --> 01:58:09.218
That woman named “Eftelya”s life is
more valuable than the rest of us.

01:58:09.618 --> 01:58:11.884
We must save the
nomad tent first, if God permits!

01:58:12.451 --> 01:58:14.451
Our emancipation is up to that woman.

01:58:15.684 --> 01:58:17.151
If anything happens to me...

01:58:18.484 --> 01:58:21.118
...do not let them keep
Turgut in their hands, brother.

01:58:25.318 --> 01:58:26.851
May God help us.

01:58:26.918 --> 01:58:27.918
Amen.

01:58:36.284 --> 01:58:38.184
Please do not do this in this dargah.

01:58:38.418 --> 01:58:39.818
It is a shame, please.

01:58:51.684 --> 01:58:52.751
Please don't do it!

01:58:57.451 --> 01:58:58.851
Don't do it, it is a shame!

01:59:03.518 --> 01:59:04.818
What are you looking at?

01:59:04.884 --> 01:59:07.284
Move if you do not want
to be killed like them!

01:59:12.884 --> 01:59:14.451
Enter, come on.

01:59:18.418 --> 01:59:20.651
That bastard Nasir
got a whiff of our smell.

01:59:21.218 --> 01:59:22.484
There are too many of them.

01:59:22.551 --> 01:59:23.718
End of the road, Turk!

01:59:24.484 --> 01:59:26.684
You can not escape
from the hounds of hell.

01:59:26.751 --> 01:59:28.818
You will get punched in the face.

01:59:30.451 --> 01:59:32.218
We must take this woman out of here.

01:59:32.284 --> 01:59:35.351
I will take not only this woman,
but also all of you out.

01:59:35.618 --> 01:59:37.151
Aren't you coming with us?

01:59:37.218 --> 01:59:39.251
They do not have the guts to touch us, Bey

01:59:39.318 --> 01:59:40.318
Do not worry.

01:59:44.884 --> 01:59:46.184
Come on, let's go.

01:59:51.351 --> 01:59:52.351
Come on.

02:00:00.451 --> 02:00:02.151
Here, be quick.

02:00:03.651 --> 02:00:05.351
We can not leave you here, dervish.

02:00:05.651 --> 02:00:07.384
I can not abandon this dargah, Bey.

02:00:07.818 --> 02:00:09.118
May God speed you!

02:00:27.284 --> 02:00:30.118
Open the door, who is in there?

02:00:42.451 --> 02:00:44.218
Tell me, dervish!  Where are they?

02:00:44.284 --> 02:00:45.318
They left, Bey.

02:00:45.884 --> 02:00:47.584
Where did those villains go? Speak!

02:00:48.418 --> 02:00:50.384
To the place where
God wants them to be.

02:00:51.384 --> 02:00:54.484
Do not seek the malice,
which rots us inside out, in them.

02:00:55.518 --> 02:00:58.118
Dervish, they are villains.

02:00:59.451 --> 02:01:02.184
They are betraying
our state and our religion.

02:01:03.618 --> 02:01:06.518
Be a dervish worthy
of the holiness of this dargah.

02:01:07.384 --> 02:01:10.118
We have come here to reform Aleppo.

02:01:10.551 --> 02:01:12.318
Tell us where they are.

02:01:12.884 --> 02:01:16.584
And when it is said to them,
"Do not cause corruption on the earth"...

02:01:17.151 --> 02:01:19.584
...they say: "We are but reformers."

02:01:20.518 --> 02:01:25.651
Unquestionably, it is they who are
the corrupters, but they perceive not.

02:01:33.551 --> 02:01:36.184
And thus, the people
you are looking for are not here.

02:01:37.251 --> 02:01:38.718
I witness that...

02:01:43.351 --> 02:01:44.884
You leave here with the soldiers.

02:01:46.584 --> 02:01:49.518
I am going to the place
where Ertugrul and the nanny will meet.

02:02:11.918 --> 02:02:14.418
My uncle tagged him
along behind us to protect me.

02:02:14.818 --> 02:02:16.518
He won't harm us, do not worry.

02:02:18.118 --> 02:02:19.118
Come on.

02:02:26.751 --> 02:02:30.751
While you were in the dungeon you were
saying that you had seen a Muslim man.

02:02:31.684 --> 02:02:33.184
A Muslim like you.

02:02:39.551 --> 02:02:40.684
I do not remember.

02:02:44.718 --> 02:02:45.918
There was a man...

02:02:49.184 --> 02:02:50.184
But...

02:02:50.518 --> 02:02:51.651
I do not know...

02:02:54.418 --> 02:02:55.418
...where he is now

02:03:00.784 --> 02:03:04.151
Where am I? How did I come here?

02:03:04.718 --> 02:03:07.451
Turgut, Turgut!

02:03:10.151 --> 02:03:11.151
Turgut.

02:03:43.384 --> 02:03:45.218
You must be very careful Isadora

02:03:45.284 --> 02:03:47.151
He is a Turk eventually.

02:03:48.151 --> 02:03:49.851
He is a lone mountain wolf.

02:03:50.384 --> 02:03:52.351
Do not forget that the mountain wolves...

02:03:52.418 --> 02:03:56.484
...never let go of you once
they bite you with their teeth.

02:04:04.551 --> 02:04:05.718
Turgut, are you fine?

02:04:08.851 --> 02:04:09.851
Help him.

02:04:58.884 --> 02:05:02.284
Eftelya will die tonight,
Your Holiness The Cardinal.

02:05:02.651 --> 02:05:05.384
-What about the wedding?
-That job is done.

02:05:08.551 --> 02:05:10.418
I hope you are right, Petruccio.

02:05:11.151 --> 02:05:13.418
Your holy war...

02:05:14.251 --> 02:05:16.718
...and also me becoming
the Pope are up to this.

02:05:19.151 --> 02:05:21.718
Did I tell you how I killed the Pope?

02:05:22.784 --> 02:05:27.684
I want to know it down
to the last detail, dear Thomas.

02:05:28.851 --> 02:05:30.151
Come, sit

02:05:30.884 --> 02:05:32.284
You must be tired.

02:05:37.384 --> 02:05:40.218
A glass of wine
would relieve all my tiredness.

02:05:41.118 --> 02:05:42.251
With pleasure!

02:06:22.851 --> 02:06:25.518
You three go this way! You come with me.

02:06:30.684 --> 02:06:32.351
That scoundrel named Kara Toygar.

02:06:33.684 --> 02:06:35.151
How dare he come here?

02:06:36.184 --> 02:06:39.584
To serve the purpose of Sultan Aleaddin's
goals. He is his ambassador.

02:06:40.218 --> 02:06:42.518
He never serves for anyone but himself.

02:06:44.118 --> 02:06:46.184
What are you planning to do,
Your Highness The Ameer?

02:06:46.618 --> 02:06:48.784
I have consulted
this matter with consultants.

02:06:49.918 --> 02:06:52.284
We will send ambassadors
to the Turkmen tribes.

02:06:53.551 --> 02:06:57.518
We will inform the Turkmens that have been
supressed by Kara Toygar and such...

02:06:57.918 --> 02:07:01.118
...that their lost Shahzade is with us.

02:07:02.184 --> 02:07:05.618
We will invite the people who want
to stop the Aleaddin Keykubat's reign...

02:07:05.684 --> 02:07:06.918
...to our wedding.

02:07:08.218 --> 02:07:11.818
But this would be very dangerous,
Your Highness The Ameer!

02:07:12.784 --> 02:07:17.284
As you would appreciate,
Keykubat will see this as an attack.

02:07:17.351 --> 02:07:21.618
Anyway, we can talk
about this in detail later.

02:07:24.151 --> 02:07:25.151
By the way...

02:07:27.284 --> 02:07:30.551
...I wanted to do a small change
after the latest developments.

02:07:32.218 --> 02:07:36.818
I decided that best thing to do is to
marry without the wedding ceremony.

02:07:38.918 --> 02:07:41.284
If you do not mind, of course.

02:07:44.784 --> 02:07:47.651
As you please, Your Highness The Ameer.

02:08:17.518 --> 02:08:18.851
Your Highness The Ameer!

02:08:25.184 --> 02:08:26.284
Shahzade?

02:08:26.351 --> 02:08:29.651
I would like to talk to you,
if you do not mind.

02:08:29.918 --> 02:08:31.618
Of course, I am listening to you.

02:08:38.284 --> 02:08:40.251
My sister will never love you, ever.

02:08:42.618 --> 02:08:44.384
She is in love with somebody else.

02:08:46.151 --> 02:08:47.184
With whom?

02:08:48.518 --> 02:08:49.884
With my brother Ertugrul.

02:08:51.451 --> 02:08:54.118
Keep away from my sister and us!

02:09:24.284 --> 02:09:25.851
Where have you been Ertugrul Bey?

02:11:38.584 --> 02:11:40.484
Ertugrul, Eftelya!

02:12:51.217 --> 02:12:52.284
Bamsi!

02:12:54.451 --> 02:12:55.618
Don't linger around!

02:13:41.351 --> 02:13:42.418
Don't!
