00:00.000 --> 01:40.500
Episode 11 will start after 12 min

11:58.614 --> 12:01.614
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

12:03.861 --> 12:06.861
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

12:08.047 --> 12:11.047
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

13:37.863 --> 13:40.863
{\an8}Amanos Mountains
The Templar’s Castle

13:47.279 --> 13:49.446
How many knights
are you taking with you, Marcus?

13:49.513 --> 13:52.279
Twelve, sir.
They are waiting for me by the hillside.

13:52.746 --> 13:53.946
Good.

13:54.013 --> 13:57.879
-Godspeed you like Jesus and the apostles.
-Thank you, sir.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.579
Eftelya must die, Marcus.

14:01.679 --> 14:04.513
Not only her, but also Ertugrul.

14:05.546 --> 14:07.346
If you succeed in this...

14:08.346 --> 14:12.513
...we will have the control
of all the Kayi tribe in our hands.

14:13.313 --> 14:16.313
Eftelya does not have to die, sir.

14:16.379 --> 14:19.013
Now her true identity is revealed.

14:19.913 --> 14:22.413
If she lives,
all of us would be under threat.

14:23.879 --> 14:28.246
She was our precious and loyal sister.

14:29.513 --> 14:31.346
Unfortunately,
this is the decree absolute.

14:32.213 --> 14:35.646
God would grant her
what she deserves in His heaven.

14:37.313 --> 14:39.713
I want Ertugrul’s head, Marcus.

14:41.713 --> 14:44.579
It would be great
if we invited Suleyman Shah to dinner...

14:45.479 --> 14:47.713
...and served his son’s head...

14:47.779 --> 14:50.713
...as a welcome gift.

15:30.379 --> 15:31.679
Hope nothing is wrong, Kurdoglu.

15:32.646 --> 15:36.913
Why are you standing there like
a poplar tree at this time of the morning?

15:36.979 --> 15:39.546
Go your own way, Wild Demir!
I am already worn out.

15:41.446 --> 15:43.379
Just tell me if you need anything.

15:43.446 --> 15:45.546
I would prune your branches,
I would water you.

15:45.613 --> 15:48.313
I can even fertilize you if you like.

15:59.579 --> 16:01.846
Selcan, take it sweetheart.

16:15.979 --> 16:18.813
Selcan, my beautiful bride.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.479
What happened? Tell me.

16:23.279 --> 16:24.446
Who upset you?

16:25.646 --> 16:27.613
What are you afraid of? Just tell me.

16:33.213 --> 16:36.279
Is there a malice
on our men going to Aleppo?

16:38.846 --> 16:40.946
If there is, just say it
so we can find a solution.

16:42.479 --> 16:47.746
Your man, my two sons are on the way.
Come on, just tell your mother.

16:55.613 --> 16:56.813
The road to Aleppo...

16:57.879 --> 17:00.246
...had turned into
the river of blood, mother.

17:00.946 --> 17:03.646
Our heroes were drifting along.

17:05.546 --> 17:07.513
All the mountains...

17:07.579 --> 17:11.613
...all the hills
were erupting with flames.

17:12.646 --> 17:14.713
Blood was everywhere, blood!

17:15.746 --> 17:19.346
Then I jumped in the river of the blood.

17:19.879 --> 17:22.646
Then I looked in each
and every other face of our heroes.

17:22.713 --> 17:25.746
I looked for Gundogdu’s dead body, mother.

17:25.813 --> 17:29.679
Blood was everywhere.
No man has ever seen this much blood.

17:35.246 --> 17:36.346
Selcan.

17:37.346 --> 17:39.446
My beloved daughter was this just a dream?

17:40.279 --> 17:42.213
It was much much real than a dream.

17:43.946 --> 17:46.779
I saw Ertugrul’s dead body.

17:46.846 --> 17:48.279
It was drifting along.

17:49.613 --> 17:51.013
God forbid.

17:54.746 --> 17:58.246
<i>La ilahe illallah Muhammeden resulullah</i>

18:00.946 --> 18:03.913
Selcan, come on,
let me take you to your tent.

18:03.979 --> 18:05.713
Come on sweetheart.

18:10.613 --> 18:13.913
Bey, I will be right back
after taking her to the tent.

18:15.979 --> 18:17.746
Do not bother, mother.

18:17.813 --> 18:19.579
I am fine. I can go by myself.

18:20.746 --> 18:21.746
I am fine.

18:23.779 --> 18:24.813
I’m fine.

18:55.546 --> 18:57.313
What is wrong with her, Hayme?

18:58.579 --> 19:01.746
Are we supposed to deal with her lunacy
as we have so much things to worry about?

19:03.713 --> 19:05.746
She is pregnant, Bey. It is not easy.

19:06.879 --> 19:10.246
She is with a child
and doesn’t know what is coming next.

19:11.646 --> 19:14.946
Living is hard without knowing
what tomorrow will bring.

19:16.013 --> 19:17.879
Her man went to Aleppo.

19:19.313 --> 19:21.446
Who knows what other problems she has.

19:22.313 --> 19:23.846
These things are upsetting her.

19:25.879 --> 19:27.213
Keep an eye on her.

19:27.813 --> 19:28.979
Nothing is predictable.

19:29.813 --> 19:31.013
May God help her.

19:32.346 --> 19:35.913
I got stunned seeing her
like this early in the morning.

20:38.213 --> 20:39.613
What do you think you are doing?

20:40.413 --> 20:42.879
There is a saying: “Don’t go
on a journey with a woman’s mind.”

20:42.946 --> 20:44.513
So it was true.

20:44.579 --> 20:47.313
Gundogdu went with that bastard.

20:50.313 --> 20:52.979
You must not let
this ruin my family, Kurdoglu.

20:54.346 --> 20:55.346
How come?

20:55.846 --> 20:58.646
Only Ertugrul was
supposed to go with his Alps.

20:58.713 --> 21:00.513
My Gundogdu...

21:00.579 --> 21:02.879
...convinced his father
in order to go with them.

21:03.946 --> 21:06.746
They are aware of
the troubles this mission may cause.

21:07.446 --> 21:09.679
Suleyman Shah has sent Hamza with them.

21:10.713 --> 21:13.746
Do not worry. I will do anything I can.

21:14.979 --> 21:16.013
Kurdoglu!

21:17.779 --> 21:19.946
Are you not going
to tell me who is involved in this?

21:21.246 --> 21:24.446
The less people know,
the safer we will be.

21:25.946 --> 21:26.946
Both of us.

21:40.646 --> 21:42.513
Sister, what was he doing here?

21:45.346 --> 21:48.313
He came to comfort me
after hearing what happened.

21:49.946 --> 21:51.513
What comfort, sister?

21:52.746 --> 21:53.779
Gundogdu...

21:53.846 --> 21:56.513
...is on the way to Aleppo with Ertugrul.

22:57.213 --> 23:00.446
I have got loads to do
and Aykiz is not around.

23:04.246 --> 23:05.346
Where is she?

23:24.313 --> 23:26.213
Permission to come in, Selcan?

23:29.513 --> 23:30.679
Come on in, Master Demir.

23:35.279 --> 23:36.579
Good morning.

23:39.946 --> 23:41.213
Thank you.

23:41.279 --> 23:43.446
We were about to eat breakfast, join us.

23:44.313 --> 23:47.379
Thank you. Next time,
if God permits. I'm looking for Aykiz.

23:47.446 --> 23:50.213
I couldn’t find her so
I thought she might be here.

23:50.279 --> 23:51.513
Why are you asking us?

23:52.013 --> 23:54.979
Are we meant to stay together
all the time in this accursed nomad group.

24:01.479 --> 24:02.646
If you excuse me...

24:07.779 --> 24:09.213
Master Demir!

24:15.446 --> 24:16.713
Forgive us.

24:17.846 --> 24:19.346
My sister is a little bit nervous.

24:21.579 --> 24:24.546
For what? Hope nothing bad has happened.

24:25.479 --> 24:28.946
Gundogdu Bey went to Aleppo with Ertugrul.

24:33.613 --> 24:35.579
Okay, girl, okay.

25:18.946 --> 25:20.346
Master Demir!

25:29.646 --> 25:30.646
Master Demir!

25:56.513 --> 25:58.213
Eftelya is escaping, sir.

25:58.279 --> 25:59.779
Let’s move!

25:59.846 --> 26:01.546
We might lose their tracks in the forest.

26:02.479 --> 26:05.213
Tell the men, they must chase the Kayis.

26:05.279 --> 26:08.946
And we will chase Eftelya.
Our main target is Eftelya, don't forget.

26:09.646 --> 26:11.513
-Then you join us.
-Aye, sir!

26:11.579 --> 26:12.679
Come on!

26:48.779 --> 26:49.846
Aykiz.

26:50.846 --> 26:52.479
What have you done, Aykiz?

26:55.213 --> 26:56.479
Master Demir.

27:02.813 --> 27:04.246
What is going on, Wild Demir?

27:06.379 --> 27:07.579
Aykiz, Mother Hayme...

27:09.279 --> 27:10.679
She took her weapons and left.

27:13.746 --> 27:14.879
Be calm.

27:16.246 --> 27:18.746
Did you check the drill field?
She may be there.

27:18.813 --> 27:19.813
I did.

27:20.879 --> 27:22.013
She is not there either.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.513
Well...

27:30.246 --> 27:31.779
...what is on your mind?

27:32.546 --> 27:37.246
Obviously, she went
after Ertugrul Bey, to find Turgut.

27:39.313 --> 27:40.446
What will you do?

27:43.346 --> 27:44.346
Obviously...

27:44.846 --> 27:46.846
...Aykiz has grown up, Mother Hayme.

27:47.613 --> 27:49.213
Bey ordered me...

27:49.846 --> 27:52.879
...we are in a state of war.
I am not going to leave...

27:52.946 --> 27:55.546
...The Bey or the nomads
alone in these conditions.

27:55.613 --> 27:57.679
I won't lock the door and go after...

27:57.746 --> 27:59.946
...my daughter who is
crazier than his father.

28:01.813 --> 28:06.213
May God save them all.
I have got loads to do. Excuse me.

28:06.279 --> 28:07.346
Aykiz...

28:09.846 --> 28:12.646
...has shown the courage
to go after her man.

28:14.746 --> 28:16.413
My sons are with her.

28:17.879 --> 28:21.679
Don’t you ever worry
that she will be in trouble.

28:45.013 --> 28:46.813
We can’t go further with the horses.

29:05.246 --> 29:06.413
Over there, sir!

29:08.379 --> 29:09.513
Run!

29:30.613 --> 29:33.379
Every night 50 Alps
should lay an ambush...

29:34.579 --> 29:36.313
...on these two hills alternately.

29:37.913 --> 29:40.579
El Aziz’s troops won’t
attack at night time, Bey.

29:41.913 --> 29:43.813
The night ambush is for the Templars.

29:45.279 --> 29:47.813
They are not that brave
to attack during the day time.

29:49.479 --> 29:53.579
You can expect every malice from
them  in the darkness of the night.

29:54.379 --> 29:55.713
What about El Aziz’s troops?

29:56.746 --> 29:57.879
What shall we do for them?

29:59.979 --> 30:01.646
The children and the elderly...

30:01.713 --> 30:04.713
...shall gather in front of the marquee.
The women shall be located...

30:05.613 --> 30:07.746
...across the river
to protect them with their pikes.

30:09.379 --> 30:14.213
If El Aziz’s troops try to pass
across the river or the bridge...

30:14.779 --> 30:17.579
...the women should defend
with their long spears.

30:17.646 --> 30:21.913
Tell Wild Demir to prepare
long spears for them.

30:21.979 --> 30:23.246
Aye, Bey.

30:24.579 --> 30:27.413
As a matter of fact, if El Aziz’s men...

30:27.479 --> 30:31.413
...reach to the center of the nomad group
and start to fight with our women...

30:32.346 --> 30:33.646
...we're in deep trouble.

30:34.746 --> 30:35.946
Bey...

30:36.746 --> 30:39.546
...the warrior women
started their pike training.

30:41.746 --> 30:43.979
You may all go back to your duties.

30:52.846 --> 30:56.613
Aykiz has left for
Aleppo after Ertugrul.

30:59.779 --> 31:00.979
Oh, Love.

31:02.246 --> 31:03.513
Conquers all!

31:40.979 --> 31:42.513
O God!

32:14.346 --> 32:15.779
Oh my beautiful sister.

32:15.846 --> 32:18.713
We were both raised by the Master.

32:19.879 --> 32:20.879
We worked together.

32:21.846 --> 32:23.613
We grew up together like we were siblings.

32:25.846 --> 32:27.446
I wouldn’t want this to happen.

33:32.679 --> 33:34.379
Who are you?

33:34.446 --> 33:36.379
Suleyman Shah’s son Ertugrul.

34:20.154 --> 34:23.154
As you can speak in our language,
you’d better start speaking!

34:23.954 --> 34:25.654
I have got lots of questions for you.

34:25.720 --> 34:28.820
Then, you have to work hard
to get the answers from me.

34:28.887 --> 34:30.854
With pleasure. No problem for me.

35:14.954 --> 35:17.487
Your hands are stammering. I got that.

35:19.787 --> 35:21.820
But if your your tongue
is also stammering...

35:22.720 --> 35:24.920
...I know how to cut
and make you swallow it.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.720
You will not be able to hear
anything from my mouth!

35:29.954 --> 35:33.120
You can never make a Templar knight speak.

35:44.387 --> 35:47.454
I will not let you
kill yourself slobbering.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.487
You are going to suffer every
pain your friends had suffered.

35:53.387 --> 35:56.020
But unfortunately
you will not die easily.

36:10.020 --> 36:11.620
Bamsi!

37:26.487 --> 37:28.554
What do you want to know, Turk?

37:30.887 --> 37:31.954
Let's think.

37:32.820 --> 37:37.087
About the things your sister
who used the name Esma told us.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.787
The real bastard,
your “His Eminence the Master”...

37:45.520 --> 37:49.754
...is moving towards Jerusalem
by influencing and deceiving...

37:49.820 --> 37:51.687
...King Frederick
with the Pope's lies, right?

37:52.520 --> 37:56.487
He has already started to set up
an army of underage infants, hasn't he?

37:57.687 --> 37:58.987
You infanticides!

38:05.120 --> 38:06.154
Good.

38:06.887 --> 38:07.954
So that is all true.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.454
Let's continue.

38:12.620 --> 38:15.054
The real bastard,
“His Eminence the Master”...

38:15.120 --> 38:19.354
...is trying to give a lead to the
Crusaders by causing a conflict...

38:21.820 --> 38:25.154
...between the Seljuks
and the Ayyubids, isn't he?

38:28.587 --> 38:33.787
He has no tolerance for the small but
dangerous Kayi Group next to his borders.

38:34.420 --> 38:37.154
Therefore, he even tried
to spread plague to the nomad group.

38:38.387 --> 38:41.720
He had El Aziz eating the palm of
his hand by hiring a man called Nasir...

38:41.787 --> 38:43.520
...for the Aleppo Palace, hadn't he?

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
Good.

38:51.687 --> 38:54.554
The female serpent did a good job
telling everything she knew.

39:00.387 --> 39:04.820
Since Eftelya told everything...

39:06.820 --> 39:09.154
...what else do you want
to learn from me, Turk?

39:10.154 --> 39:11.487
Eftelya.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.920
So your sister's name is Eftelya.

39:16.754 --> 39:19.454
Nice name. What is yours?

39:21.654 --> 39:26.987
As soon as The Cardinal's
letter reaches Constantinople...

39:28.720 --> 39:34.054
...Marcus' brothers will leave
no babies alive in their cradles...

39:34.120 --> 39:37.154
...in your nomad group,
son of Suleyman Shah Ertugrul!

39:44.954 --> 39:46.154
So Marcus it is.

39:48.454 --> 39:49.654
Pleasure to meet you.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.720
Since His Eminence
the Cardinalhas come here...

39:56.454 --> 39:57.920
...it would be rude not to visit him.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.020
Bamsi.

41:20.620 --> 41:21.920
We have only one martyr.

41:24.154 --> 41:27.454
No more injureds or casualties, thank God.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.454
Take our martyr to the nomad tent.

41:46.687 --> 41:47.987
Aykiz is also coming with you.

41:49.020 --> 41:51.920
I'd rather die than go back to nomad
greoup  without taking my Turgut back.

41:51.987 --> 41:53.020
I swore.

41:53.854 --> 41:56.754
This is no longer the men's war,
it is all ours, Ertugrul Bey.

41:57.687 --> 41:58.687
Sorry.

42:13.420 --> 42:15.754
{\an8}ALEPPO

42:20.454 --> 42:21.920
That is the status, Afsin Bey.

42:22.654 --> 42:25.687
And this news after Aykutluk's death...

42:25.754 --> 42:27.154
...made us all sad.

42:29.920 --> 42:33.120
How can the Schahzade hand over
his daughter to the palace, Sheikh?

42:34.087 --> 42:35.987
Halime's condition was miserable.

42:36.954 --> 42:39.654
He just couldn't bare his daughter
melt away before his eyes.

42:41.520 --> 42:45.020
One of the reasons of his assent
for this situation, is our suggestions.

42:46.654 --> 42:49.020
None of us could know
it would end up like this.

43:05.954 --> 43:07.087
Let them in.

43:13.020 --> 43:14.654
El Aziz has arrived.

43:17.087 --> 43:18.387
Excuse me.

43:18.454 --> 43:19.520
Sure.

43:39.620 --> 43:40.920
Peace be upon you.

43:40.987 --> 43:42.820
And peace be upon you.

43:42.887 --> 43:43.987
Welcome.

43:49.687 --> 43:50.987
-Have a seat.
-After you.

44:01.720 --> 44:02.754
Ya Halebi...

44:03.720 --> 44:06.820
...my commander Nasir lost
his way while looking for my uncle.

44:07.754 --> 44:10.687
He has gone too far
by raiding your dargah.

44:12.754 --> 44:14.120
He has saddened you.

44:18.120 --> 44:20.154
I wanted to visit you in person.

44:21.054 --> 44:22.720
I want you to accept my apologies.

44:24.787 --> 44:28.520
I wanted
Sheikh Ibn'ul Arabi's blessings.

44:31.720 --> 44:34.620
Also, I have one small request
to ask if he may accept.

44:34.687 --> 44:39.687
You are welcome, but Sheikh
has departed for Jerusalem.

44:46.754 --> 44:50.454
And about to Nasir's misbehaviour,
Sheikh is high-minded.

44:52.454 --> 44:54.354
He has already
forgotten about that cruelty.

44:55.154 --> 45:00.154
But the main thing which he deplores the
most is, your mercilessness on your uncle.

45:02.420 --> 45:05.720
Ya Halebi, my uncle's
condition hurts me too.

45:07.087 --> 45:08.487
But he went too far...

45:08.554 --> 45:10.987
...and allied with the enemy
for his desire for the throne.

45:12.754 --> 45:14.087
I want this to be known.

45:15.587 --> 45:18.987
Otherwise, how can a man
sacrifice his own uncle?

45:20.920 --> 45:24.787
Time is the remedy
for everything, Your Highness The Ameer.

45:25.654 --> 45:28.087
Not only it shows the faults,
but also the good deeds.

45:33.654 --> 45:36.987
You said you had a request
from Sheikh. Maybe we can help.

45:40.687 --> 45:42.620
It is for an auspicious cause, Ya Halebi.

45:43.120 --> 45:45.554
I finally found the wife
I have been looking for.

45:47.087 --> 45:50.887
I want Ibn'ul Arabi to solemnize
our marriage if he approves.

45:51.520 --> 45:56.020
<i>God ble</i>ss. God bless your intentions.
Who might be this angelic girl?

45:57.120 --> 45:58.487
Halime Sultan.

46:00.920 --> 46:02.554
The Seljuk Sultan!

46:06.920 --> 46:07.920
Really?

46:37.554 --> 46:42.054
Titus, learn our cuisine
as much as you have learned our language.

46:43.020 --> 46:45.554
You can not find food this good
even in the the Pope's palace.

46:49.354 --> 46:51.487
Do you know why I like you, Kurdoglu?

46:52.820 --> 46:54.387
Why?

46:54.454 --> 46:56.420
You Turkmens are very fond of guests.

46:57.420 --> 46:59.854
But you can turn this into profit.

47:01.454 --> 47:03.154
That's why it is easy to get on with you.

47:08.387 --> 47:10.454
Our men must have captured Eftelya.

47:11.687 --> 47:13.687
You must take action immediately.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.654
This task must be complete by tonight.

47:18.687 --> 47:20.587
The death of Suleyman Shah is not enough.

47:21.354 --> 47:24.754
I need the power in order them
to obey what I say in the nomad group.

47:26.620 --> 47:28.554
What is that power?

47:28.620 --> 47:30.787
You should be more generous, Titus.

47:31.620 --> 47:33.454
Tne nomad group is
on the road for such a long time.

47:33.520 --> 47:37.387
The money you have paid for
the goods is not enough for the group.

47:37.454 --> 47:42.120
A Bey should be open-handed,
feed the famished and equip the needy.

47:43.354 --> 47:45.887
You are more noxious
than I thought, Kurdoglu.

47:47.554 --> 47:49.120
I will have the gold ready for you.

47:51.654 --> 47:53.854
But if I don't get what I want...

47:53.920 --> 47:56.154
...I will make you swallow
every coin, one by one.

47:58.154 --> 48:00.154
And you are more generous
than I thought, Titus.

48:01.754 --> 48:05.720
When Suleyman Shah dies,
your nomad group will leave here.

48:06.387 --> 48:11.154
And of course there will be a price for
the group to get ready to migrate again.

48:29.454 --> 48:32.020
Speak you mutt, speak!

48:32.087 --> 48:35.620
Who is the rat in the nomad group? Speak!

48:50.354 --> 48:52.587
Brother. Brother.

48:55.820 --> 48:57.654
Even our anger should
differ from the Satan.

49:04.554 --> 49:07.087
You can't make one of them speak
just because she is a woman...

49:07.154 --> 49:09.987
...and the other one because you pity him.

49:36.687 --> 49:38.820
Brother, are you fine?

49:39.854 --> 49:42.454
I am not fine Ertugrul, not fine.

49:44.887 --> 49:46.020
Look at us!

49:46.987 --> 49:49.054
Even Aykiz went berserk with anger.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.987
If we let her, she would kill them both.

49:51.787 --> 49:52.787
And me?

49:53.354 --> 49:55.754
If you had not stopped me,
I would have killed the captive.

49:58.020 --> 50:00.820
Rarely does a day go by
without having a martyr.

50:00.887 --> 50:02.954
The nomad group
will be in deep sorrow again.

50:03.020 --> 50:04.954
Look at the things we are talking about.

50:05.020 --> 50:08.554
The Pope, the Cardinal, the Emperor!

50:10.887 --> 50:14.954
My brother Ertugrul,
how on earth did we become such?

50:15.020 --> 50:16.954
We used to look for
grasslands for the cow.

50:25.954 --> 50:27.554
And now?

50:27.620 --> 50:29.120
On one hand the Mongols...

50:29.354 --> 50:31.087
...and the Crusaders on the other.

50:31.820 --> 50:35.654
Is anything possible with a dozen
of Kayis and three dozens of Oghuzs?

50:37.920 --> 50:39.620
Look what that infidel is saying!

50:39.687 --> 50:42.354
He says that the Crusaders
would exterminate the Kayis first.

50:45.654 --> 50:47.054
We already knew that, brother.

50:48.487 --> 50:49.920
We were just not ready enough.

50:59.820 --> 51:01.654
Our new homeland is a paradise, brother.

51:03.587 --> 51:06.354
It is only a beaten track
in the destiny God has drawn for us.

51:08.520 --> 51:10.820
We can never know if
the lives of us all will end here.

51:11.820 --> 51:13.854
But still, we must be
thankful for this place.

51:20.587 --> 51:22.720
If God has granted us this place...

51:24.454 --> 51:26.987
...we must protect it as good as
God would want us to protect.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.087
This place is a blessing.

51:31.520 --> 51:33.387
Let's be thankful for this blessing.

51:35.487 --> 51:39.954
Let's be thankful for it,
so that our hearts can find peace.

51:51.387 --> 51:53.020
Giddy-up!

51:53.987 --> 51:55.354
Aykiz!

52:53.420 --> 52:55.954
I thought, perhaps the horse
could do what you could not...

52:56.020 --> 52:58.620
...and make this bastard
say where my Turgut is.

52:58.687 --> 53:00.820
Are you out of your mind?
Enough already!

53:01.720 --> 53:03.154
You were about to kill the man.

53:04.387 --> 53:05.820
We need him alive, not dead!

53:07.054 --> 53:09.420
How will you make him speak?
He is not speaking.

53:10.054 --> 53:12.787
They are not beneficial
to us, alive or dead!

53:18.854 --> 53:21.587
It does not make any difference
if we save Turgut or not.

53:22.554 --> 53:24.687
Aykiz can make anyone suffer, Dogan.

53:24.754 --> 53:26.120
Woe, Turgut, woe!

53:26.354 --> 53:29.087
Being held captive is tough,
but being free will also be tough for him.

54:20.020 --> 54:21.654
I talked to my peer Halebi.

54:23.420 --> 54:24.654
He told me everything.

54:28.920 --> 54:31.354
Leyla, I made a mistake.

54:32.687 --> 54:34.720
I did so much injustice to Ertugrul.

54:38.387 --> 54:39.754
Forgive me.

54:41.487 --> 54:44.420
I only had your best interest at heart.

54:47.754 --> 54:48.754
Nanny.

54:57.720 --> 55:01.020
We must save my brother
and our palace from them.

55:03.654 --> 55:05.487
He is the only one who can help us.

55:07.054 --> 55:09.687
What can he do against
the Templars all by himself?

55:10.420 --> 55:11.420
He is so young.

55:12.954 --> 55:14.520
I trust him, Nanny.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.387
He is the only one we can trust.

55:21.487 --> 55:22.554
Where is Halime?

55:24.020 --> 55:25.020
Is she fine?

55:26.354 --> 55:27.454
She is fine.

55:29.687 --> 55:32.754
Your brother locked Halime
and his father up in a room.

55:32.820 --> 55:34.387
He is hiding them from everyone.

55:34.887 --> 55:37.554
What is my brother trying to do, Nanny?

55:40.487 --> 55:42.087
He wants to marry Halime.

55:43.087 --> 55:44.520
He also convinced her father.

55:55.520 --> 55:58.987
When will this glorious
wedding in Aleppo be?

56:00.487 --> 56:04.454
As soon as possible hopefully,
Your Eminence The Cardinal.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.754
You have no idea how excited I am...

56:08.820 --> 56:13.654
...for El Aziz and Schahzade's daughter
Halime entering the nuptial chamber.

56:13.720 --> 56:16.120
It feels as if you are
entering it, doesn't it?

56:19.587 --> 56:22.487
It will be a legendary wedding ceremony.

56:22.554 --> 56:24.054
For 40 days and nights.

56:24.787 --> 56:30.087
The bride and groom will get the biggest
wedding portion from Sultan Alaaddin.

56:32.420 --> 56:36.887
Alaaddin's sleeping army
will be hitting the road soon.

57:15.954 --> 57:17.054
Peace be upon you.

57:17.120 --> 57:18.120
And peace be upon you.

57:19.687 --> 57:20.687
My Schahzade...

57:21.454 --> 57:23.087
...do you allow me
to talk to your daughter?

57:29.387 --> 57:30.487
I do.

57:31.620 --> 57:33.054
I will be in front of the door.

57:35.387 --> 57:36.587
Halime.

57:52.387 --> 57:53.520
Halime.

57:55.987 --> 57:57.520
Beautiful Sultan.

58:01.420 --> 58:02.987
I will cut the things you know short.

58:04.654 --> 58:06.520
Your father is a Seljuk Shahzade.

58:08.087 --> 58:12.487
Our marriage will change
the fate of Aleppo from bad to good.

58:14.354 --> 58:16.120
These are the obvious
reasons of our marriage.

58:17.920 --> 58:20.054
And also there are things
deep in my heart.

58:23.954 --> 58:27.787
Things, I can not tell anybody.
Things, nobody knows.

58:29.420 --> 58:31.020
Halime...

58:31.087 --> 58:34.820
...the first time I saw you was in my
sister Leyla's room. You were wounded.

58:35.420 --> 58:36.520
And since that time...

58:36.587 --> 58:39.520
Your Higness The Ameer,
I only care about the obvious reasons.

58:42.687 --> 58:44.820
And in return,
I have a request to ask from you.

58:46.820 --> 58:51.387
I can only agree to marry you
if you are kind enough to fulfill it.

58:52.787 --> 58:54.454
Whatever you wish Halime Sultan.

58:55.887 --> 58:59.687
Say Aleppo, and I will
give the entire city to you.

59:00.754 --> 59:02.120
Ask Aleppo as dower...

59:02.787 --> 59:03.987
...and if I don't give it...

59:04.754 --> 59:07.820
...may God punish me
in the day of reckoning.

59:07.887 --> 59:09.454
I only want my brother.

59:12.020 --> 59:15.754
If you bring my hero safe
and sound, I will marry you.

01:00:12.454 --> 01:00:14.787
I am no different than
those demons, aren't I?

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:20.554
I acted so inhumane.

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:25.754
If you had let me...

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.720
Take this meat for them to eat.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.820
Let's remember our humanity.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.454
How will we learn who the rat is
and the way to the castle, Ertugrul Bey?

01:00:50.687 --> 01:00:53.920
How will we take my Turgut away
from those demon's den?

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:06.420
Your Highness The Ameer.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:14.487
Sir, could you talk to Halime Sultan?

01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:22.054
Is there a problem
Your Highness the Ameer?

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:23.954
A problem?

01:02:25.487 --> 01:02:27.087
There are plenty of them, Nasir.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.487
Whatever they are,
let us solve them all immediately, sir.

01:02:33.354 --> 01:02:35.520
For once in my life,
a girl didn't say “Yes” to me.

01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:39.887
Don't you also see
this as a serious problem, Nasir?

01:02:41.554 --> 01:02:42.587
To an Ameer  like me...

01:02:43.987 --> 01:02:45.120
...to a poet...

01:02:47.354 --> 01:02:48.887
...to a man of love full of emotions.

01:02:50.554 --> 01:02:52.587
She must be acting coquettish to you, sir.

01:02:53.887 --> 01:02:54.887
No.

01:02:56.554 --> 01:02:57.687
No Nasir.

01:02:58.554 --> 01:03:04.020
She doesn't have the slightest desire
for me or for the things I own.

01:03:07.454 --> 01:03:10.554
For my wealth,
for my army, for my palace...

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.854
She doesn't have the slightest desire.

01:03:16.387 --> 01:03:17.887
Did she say “No” to you, sir?

01:03:18.687 --> 01:03:20.154
She said she had a condition.

01:03:23.487 --> 01:03:27.120
If only I save his brother Yigit
from the Templars and bring him...

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.554
...she said she would marry me.

01:03:32.054 --> 01:03:34.154
So, she requested
the impossible from me, Nasir.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.754
It is another way of saying “no”.

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:44.987
A well educated Shahzade daughter's way of
refusing an Ameer  in a kind manner.

01:03:46.987 --> 01:03:48.420
Your Highness The Ameer...

01:03:48.854 --> 01:03:54.787
...Ebu Hisham has a gift for you for
handing over him the entire city's trade.

01:03:57.854 --> 01:04:00.520
Our little Shahzade
will be in Aleppo by tomorrow.

01:04:07.954 --> 01:04:09.387
Is this possible?

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.554
So fast?

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:18.820
Thank God.

01:04:20.154 --> 01:04:22.154
So, Ebu Hisham is that powerful, huh?

01:04:23.354 --> 01:04:24.387
We will see.

01:04:27.087 --> 01:04:28.654
Look Nasir, you will see...

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:33.820
...it won't take long to conquer Halime
Sultan's heart when she marries me.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.987
I am sure of it, Your Highness The Ameer.

01:04:37.054 --> 01:04:39.454
Which woman can ever say
“no” to a man like you?

01:04:40.554 --> 01:04:43.887
I am sure you will conquer
her heart as soon as possible.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.520
Any news from Esma?

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.720
Unfortunately, Your Highness the Ameer.

01:04:55.054 --> 01:04:57.054
We are searching
everywhere to find her body.

01:04:58.087 --> 01:05:01.887
Unfortunately, our chance of finding
her alive doesn't exist anymore.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.754
What about the Kayis?

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:07.887
I have had an army of
4000 special guards set up.

01:05:09.487 --> 01:05:12.654
If they do not abandon
our land in two days...

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.920
4000 soldiers are not enough.

01:05:15.754 --> 01:05:18.987
But the Kayi tribe
has only 2000 soldiers, sir.

01:05:19.054 --> 01:05:21.620
Nasir, do what I say.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.687
We must complete
this task without any blood.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.887
In the end, I do not want any
Muslim's blood to be shed.

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.454
They must be so appalled...

01:05:32.454 --> 01:05:35.087
...so that they would surrender
and shove of immediately.

01:05:35.154 --> 01:05:37.054
As you wish, Your Highness the Ameer.

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:42.754
But if they don't surrender
and decide to fight...

01:05:43.887 --> 01:05:45.887
...I wouldn't leave any of them alive.

01:05:46.554 --> 01:05:48.487
This is no joke, sir.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.020
How does it feel to
be separated, Aktolgali?

01:06:09.154 --> 01:06:14.787
Seperated from whom you love, from
your companion, your blood brother.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.854
How does it feel?

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.520
It wouldn't feel as much painful...

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.754
...if all the people on the world
gathered, shot arrows at you...

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:34.087
...tore your body down
to pieces, as that, Aktolgali.

01:06:36.387 --> 01:06:38.354
My loved one is in the Aleppo Hell.

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:44.120
My blood brother is held
captive by the Knights Templar.

01:06:47.454 --> 01:06:49.354
How will this suffering end, Aktolgali?

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:51.820
Huh?

01:06:55.787 --> 01:06:56.787
It will!

01:06:57.654 --> 01:06:58.687
It must!

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:06.520
My sword will not be put
into the sheath until that day comes.

01:07:06.587 --> 01:07:11.987
I will make this world a hell for the
people who caused us all this pain...

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.120
...who turned this world into the hell.

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.887
My soul will not leave my body
before I bring the reign...

01:07:20.887 --> 01:07:23.720
...of the tyrants to an end.

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.087
Oh God.

01:07:36.787 --> 01:07:39.754
Give me the strength
to stand up against the tyrants.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.120
Grant me your mercifulness
so that I am able to help the suffering.

01:07:46.554 --> 01:07:48.787
Make my sword work for
the commandment of justice.

01:07:50.354 --> 01:07:53.687
Predestine me and my race
to be at your service only.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.820
Ertugrul! What are you doing?

01:08:31.587 --> 01:08:32.887
Ertugrul!

01:08:46.754 --> 01:08:48.087
Give this to your Master.

01:08:49.854 --> 01:08:53.420
I wrote to him that I was coming.
He shall wait, I will be there.

01:08:57.887 --> 01:08:59.054
Help him.

01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:28.454
Give him my regards.

01:09:40.954 --> 01:09:42.620
What is going on in your mind, Ertugrul?

01:09:44.154 --> 01:09:46.787
I have the best tracker
in my mind, brother.

01:09:47.754 --> 01:09:48.787
Hamza.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.954
If you agree, I want to
send Hamza to chase him.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.120
-He can learn the location of the castle.
-Good idea.

01:09:58.354 --> 01:09:59.954
-Hamza?
-Aye, Bey!

01:10:02.854 --> 01:10:05.854
If you will excuse me,
I would like to go with Hamza.

01:10:14.354 --> 01:10:16.054
Learn the location of the castle, Hamza.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.154
If anything bad happens to us...

01:10:18.387 --> 01:10:20.720
...at least my father
should know where the castle is.

01:10:20.787 --> 01:10:21.887
All right, my Bey!

01:10:28.354 --> 01:10:29.687
May God speed you!

01:10:38.054 --> 01:10:39.354
Let's wait till noon.

01:10:40.854 --> 01:10:42.720
Everybody in Aleppo
must be looking for us.

01:11:28.654 --> 01:11:30.054
Is the letter from Nasir?

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.020
I think so, sir.

01:11:45.854 --> 01:11:47.754
Get Shahzade Yigit ready.

01:11:49.087 --> 01:11:53.654
He is going to Aleppo
to witness his sister's wedding.

01:12:24.987 --> 01:12:26.420
I am very sorry, Isadora.

01:12:31.754 --> 01:12:34.554
How will I look at the face of that
demon who happens to be my uncle?

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:37.820
How on earth will I be able
to salute him when I see him?

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.754
How will I sit by the fireplace
and read books with him?

01:12:46.087 --> 01:12:48.854
I feel like I am losing
my mind thinking all about it.

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:56.720
That monster murdered my sister,
buried my father alive in the dungeon.

01:12:59.887 --> 01:13:01.120
May God help me.

01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:06.387
We will have the power to stand till
my brother Ertugrul comes to rescue us.

01:13:07.154 --> 01:13:08.487
What if he doesn't come?

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.654
What if Afsin doesn't succeed?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.854
They never give up.

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:15.054
If necessary, they will
come for my brother Turgut...

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.687
...and make this castle
collapse around them.

01:13:18.387 --> 01:13:19.520
What about us?

01:13:20.687 --> 01:13:21.787
Me and my father?

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:23.887
My uncle Afsin promised me.

01:13:25.387 --> 01:13:27.454
We will rescue you, too, believe me.

01:13:47.887 --> 01:13:48.987
What is it?

01:13:49.054 --> 01:13:52.754
We have come to take the little prince
by the order of your uncle.

01:13:54.787 --> 01:13:57.620
Hurry up little prince,
we must depart immediately.

01:13:57.687 --> 01:13:59.354
Where are you taking him to?

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.620
Please do not make this
difficult for us, madam.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.887
-No, no!
-Please!

01:14:35.454 --> 01:14:36.554
My dear uncle.

01:14:44.754 --> 01:14:46.920
Where are they taking Shahzade Yigit to?

01:14:46.987 --> 01:14:49.554
He will be coming back
again soon, Isadora.

01:14:50.754 --> 01:14:53.854
Having the Seljuk Shahzade in our hands...

01:14:54.487 --> 01:14:56.587
...gives us a great political power.

01:14:58.754 --> 01:15:02.820
Don’t worry, I won't leave you
without company in my castle.

01:15:02.887 --> 01:15:06.454
We only have a simple task
to complete in Aleppo.

01:15:17.654 --> 01:15:19.087
What is this book, uncle?

01:15:19.154 --> 01:15:22.487
It is by one of the Greek
philosophers, Aristotle.

01:15:24.887 --> 01:15:27.787
I thought the church burned
all the pagans' books.

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.487
Yes, they burned them.

01:15:30.554 --> 01:15:34.654
But those barbarian Muslims...

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:38.087
...had them all translated into Arabic
and they are reading them all.

01:15:39.054 --> 01:15:41.154
They say it is their prophet's saying:

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:45.920
“Seek knowledge even if you
have to go as far as China.”

01:15:50.654 --> 01:15:56.087
I will be right back after I send off
our guest, my beautiful Isadora.

01:16:12.987 --> 01:16:15.587
Take your hands off me!
Where are you taking me to?

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:17.520
Take your hands off me!

01:16:22.454 --> 01:16:23.687
Brother Turgut!

01:16:23.754 --> 01:16:26.954
Brother Turgut, pull yourself
together, I beg you! Save me!

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.420
Let go of me!

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.054
Let go of me I say!

01:16:38.487 --> 01:16:40.787
Where are you taking me to? Let go of me!

01:16:44.987 --> 01:16:47.420
Brother Turgut! Brother Turgut!

01:17:03.754 --> 01:17:05.954
Your little Shahzade has left, Turgut.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.787
Drink it!

01:17:25.087 --> 01:17:26.887
You will feel better.

01:17:34.387 --> 01:17:35.654
It is time.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.520
Take him to the dungeon.

01:17:40.954 --> 01:17:43.120
I will deal with him myself.

01:19:39.033 --> 01:19:40.800
We will complete this task in silence.

01:19:41.733 --> 01:19:45.733
Your duty is to take my men
out of here when it is all over.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.367
Don't worry Titus.

01:19:49.033 --> 01:19:51.633
I saw that your women
have been armed too.

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.967
We were born to fight.

01:19:53.033 --> 01:19:55.533
We love to fight with
the infidels like you the most.

01:19:56.067 --> 01:19:58.666
Our weapons become more
valuable with your blood.

01:19:59.533 --> 01:20:02.500
Be careful not to drown
in that blood one day.

01:20:02.567 --> 01:20:04.400
Titus, see the truth.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.867
Don't you ever attack my tribe where
the women cook with their weapons...

01:20:08.933 --> 01:20:10.567
...without letting me know.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.400
That would be bad for you.

01:21:06.567 --> 01:21:07.833
Bey!

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:13.633
What are you doing here?
Where are your Beys?

01:21:21.567 --> 01:21:23.433
They tried to ambush us on the way.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.867
Unfortunately, Binteki
has become a martyr, Bey.

01:21:41.567 --> 01:21:42.967
What about the others?

01:21:43.033 --> 01:21:45.633
Everybody is fine, Bey.
They will be departing for Aleppo.

01:21:46.533 --> 01:21:48.567
Aykiz and Hamza
will return to the group tomorrow.

01:21:49.033 --> 01:21:51.067
Ertugrul Bey has assigned them a task.

01:21:52.867 --> 01:21:54.633
May God protect them.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.300
Inform Ilyas Fakih.

01:21:59.333 --> 01:22:02.067
Tell him to do whatever he needs
to do for our martyr's funeral.

01:22:42.567 --> 01:22:44.933
You failed badly again, you big Kurdoglu!

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.733
It is either you or the men
you commissioned are duffers.

01:22:49.833 --> 01:22:51.833
Are you going to wreak your anger on me?

01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:55.267
Decide whose side
you are on, Selcan Hatun!

01:22:56.067 --> 01:23:01.533
I am on the side of my revenge first,
and then my man's, Kurdoglu.

01:23:03.033 --> 01:23:04.833
Now, do as you wish...

01:23:06.033 --> 01:23:09.433
...but if my Gundogdu gets hurt...

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.300
...I will kill you with my bare hands.

01:23:12.267 --> 01:23:14.967
I will take your liver out
and eat it myself...

01:23:15.033 --> 01:23:17.867
...not letting any animals
or birds of prey have a single bite.

01:23:20.767 --> 01:23:22.467
You know what I want from you.

01:23:22.933 --> 01:23:25.867
Suleyman Shah's blood
will flow down from that marquee...

01:23:25.933 --> 01:23:27.300
...like the Euphrates river.

01:23:31.733 --> 01:23:33.700
What sort of a revenge is this, Selcan?

01:23:35.433 --> 01:23:36.433
You even frighten me.

01:23:39.700 --> 01:23:42.567
You saw what my eyes saw, Kurdoglu.

01:23:43.533 --> 01:23:44.633
You also saw...

01:23:45.633 --> 01:23:49.267
...how Suleyman Shah murdered
my father without blinking an eye.

01:23:50.767 --> 01:23:53.033
All those years
I have lived for this revenge.

01:23:53.267 --> 01:23:55.300
Now it is time for me
to see that glorious day.

01:25:23.367 --> 01:25:25.267
Inform the Master. Marcus is coming!

01:25:49.267 --> 01:25:50.800
We have found their location, Hamza.

01:26:10.267 --> 01:26:12.767
-I failed, sir.
-What about Eftelya?

01:26:13.933 --> 01:26:14.933
They are going to Aleppo.

01:26:16.033 --> 01:26:19.600
Did you escape or did they set you free?

01:26:24.267 --> 01:26:27.433
Ertugrul has sent you a note, sir.

01:26:32.467 --> 01:26:34.667
Is this Eftelya's hair?

01:26:34.733 --> 01:26:36.533
He knows everything, sir.

01:26:37.767 --> 01:26:39.900
He knows everything.

01:27:00.267 --> 01:27:05.367
He removed one shoe
of your horse in order to chase you.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.600
Master.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:17.533
Idiot!

01:27:30.633 --> 01:27:33.033
We will come to rescue you soon, Turgut.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.933
The Kayis!

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.267
Kayis have entered
the House of God, you idiots!

01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:58.533
Hurry up! Hurry, get on your horses!

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:03.300
Find them for me!

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.033
A man, who can’t even
control his own castle...

01:29:21.033 --> 01:29:23.367
...trying to guide the Crusaders?

01:29:24.433 --> 01:29:25.767
Do not make me laugh, Petruccio.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:29.733
I am going to Antioch.

01:29:31.267 --> 01:29:35.800
I hope you sort out the chaos
you have caused till I am back.

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:41.367
As you would appreciate, the report
I prepared for His Holiness The Pope...

01:29:41.433 --> 01:29:44.367
...and the emperor Frederick
is completely about this matter.

01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:58.900
Kayis have turned up to your door, huh?

01:30:00.533 --> 01:30:02.467
As long as the people like you exist...

01:30:02.533 --> 01:30:06.667
...the Turks can go not only to
Constantinopolis, but also to Rome.

01:30:11.067 --> 01:30:12.700
May God forgive all our sins.

01:31:43.467 --> 01:31:46.433
Tell them to take care of
Ebu Hisham's guests, Alpargo.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.800
We must make them comfortable.

01:31:48.467 --> 01:31:49.967
Let them rest in a quiet place.

01:31:51.333 --> 01:31:52.567
Don't worry Bey.

01:32:13.333 --> 01:32:15.067
-Peace be upon you
-And peace be upon you

01:32:19.633 --> 01:32:22.933
-Peace be upon you
-And peace be upon you Atabey, welcome.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.333
Peace be upon you

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.933
Wild Demir, who are these man?

01:32:34.333 --> 01:32:36.967
They are the merchants
who have come to buy rugs...

01:32:37.033 --> 01:32:38.667
...from the rug workshop, Ata Bey.

01:32:42.366 --> 01:32:45.900
If God permits this new nomad tent
brings us abundance and richness.

01:32:46.567 --> 01:32:47.733
If God permits.

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:49.333
Come on, son, go on.

01:32:59.467 --> 01:33:00.533
Ata Bey...

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.967
...do you think Ameer  of Aleppo
will attack the nomad group?

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.400
That is unknown, son.

01:33:07.467 --> 01:33:10.733
But if they do, these weapons...

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:14.067
...will tear their armors like paper.

01:33:30.633 --> 01:33:32.733
They must put one of
these in them for sure.

01:33:33.967 --> 01:33:37.400
And this goes well with this one.

01:33:38.633 --> 01:33:41.000
Finally we are disposing
of these jinxed goods, mother.

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.000
The jinx has nothing
to do with our handicrafts, Selcan.

01:33:47.833 --> 01:33:50.767
It is because of the people
who set their eyes on our nomad tent.

01:33:50.833 --> 01:33:54.667
The pain of the heroes we lost in
the caravan raid is still in our hearts.

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.333
And we also know
who are responsible for it.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:00.067
That is why I am glad
that these goods will be gone.

01:34:01.867 --> 01:34:03.000
Peace be upon you.

01:34:03.967 --> 01:34:05.067
And peace be upon you.

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:08.767
Mother Hayme...

01:34:08.833 --> 01:34:12.400
...if you allow me,
as we have a deal on the price...

01:34:12.467 --> 01:34:14.933
...I believe my men could load the goods.

01:34:17.267 --> 01:34:18.333
Of course.

01:34:22.067 --> 01:34:26.033
If God permits, you are not vexed
with me because of my fait accompli offer.

01:34:26.633 --> 01:34:29.767
Not at all. It was a good trade.

01:34:31.267 --> 01:34:32.567
Kurdoglu shall help you.

01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:34.900
Excuse me.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.800
They say you are a good merchant.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.533
A merchant, who pays a
great deal for the goods of a nomad...

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.700
...who is in financial difficulty,
must be either stupid or playing tricks.

01:34:59.767 --> 01:35:02.833
What else can we do,
besides saying “Good luck with it”?

01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:05.533
Don't you think so, Kurdoglu?

01:35:07.733 --> 01:35:09.833
It has to be with good luck, Selcan Hatun.

01:35:10.867 --> 01:35:14.833
Neither the nomad group nor us
have patience for bad luck anymore.

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.967
She is definitely a Bey's wife.
So dangerous.

01:35:32.667 --> 01:35:35.533
As dangerous as to have
Adam expelled from the paradise.

01:35:50.367 --> 01:35:51.967
What did the merchant say?

01:35:52.933 --> 01:35:56.400
What else, he is pluming
himself on the trade he plied.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.333
What do you think about that?

01:36:04.267 --> 01:36:06.700
What should I think, mother?
Good luck with it.

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:10.367
But, there is something
that I find distrustful about him.

01:36:10.433 --> 01:36:13.300
As if he has some other
plans for Kurdoglu and us.

01:37:09.833 --> 01:37:13.300
<i>Oh God, please help us rise</i>
 <i>from the fire that we are stuck in.</i>

01:37:13.967 --> 01:37:16.533
<i>Guide us. Give us patience.</i>

01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:19.767
<i>Give Ertugrul strength, oh God.</i>

01:38:11.667 --> 01:38:13.500
Considering they haven't killed Turgut...

01:38:16.733 --> 01:38:18.267
...they must have other plans.

01:38:23.267 --> 01:38:25.967
Please, what did Afsin Bey say to you?

01:38:26.933 --> 01:38:28.533
What would they do to my comrade?

01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:32.033
What would they do to my
faithful friend, my blood brother?

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.333
If you dried the meat,
it wouldn't be edible.

01:38:35.867 --> 01:38:38.033
If it was a word, it wouldn't be talkable.

01:38:40.367 --> 01:38:42.367
Please, say it.

01:38:43.467 --> 01:38:44.933
Say that they killed him.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.067
Say that they threw his
dead body out of the ramparts.

01:38:50.667 --> 01:38:52.767
That is much bearable.

01:38:55.533 --> 01:38:57.733
But if you say they did not kill him...

01:38:59.033 --> 01:39:00.600
...that is unsufferable.

01:39:04.733 --> 01:39:05.733
Please...

01:39:06.567 --> 01:39:08.833
...if there is something
you don't say, please say it.

01:39:10.467 --> 01:39:12.800
That was what Afsin Bey said, Dogan.

01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:24.533
Bey.

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.600
Afsin...

01:39:27.367 --> 01:39:29.600
If he came from
the Templars' den himself...

01:39:30.533 --> 01:39:32.600
He should know where the castle is.

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.667
Where is Afsin?

01:39:40.867 --> 01:39:42.300
Is there a different matter?

01:39:44.867 --> 01:39:46.900
When he heard what happened to Halime...

01:39:48.533 --> 01:39:50.967
...he could not sit still.
He went off in a hurry.

01:39:57.633 --> 01:39:58.867
What happened to Halime Sultan?

01:40:00.533 --> 01:40:04.033
El Aziz wanted to marry Halime.

01:40:18.367 --> 01:40:21.467
But how can this be?

01:40:31.633 --> 01:40:33.400
And Shahzade Numan Efendi...

01:40:34.667 --> 01:40:37.500
...accepted His Highness
The Ameer's proposal.

01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:47.600
Ertugrul!

01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:32.367
You must be very careful, understood?

01:41:33.467 --> 01:41:35.433
Nobody moves before my orders.

01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:46.667
God gives the remedy as he gives
the suffering, my girl. Do not be sad.

01:41:49.067 --> 01:41:50.733
The suffering is a sorrow, Nanny.

01:41:53.767 --> 01:41:55.400
The remedy is another sorrow.

01:42:04.033 --> 01:42:06.667
I was destined to be
thankful for my sorrows.

01:42:37.667 --> 01:42:41.000
<i>I first saw this filly when I went to</i>
 <i>mountains to earn the title “Alp</i>”.

01:42:41.667 --> 01:42:43.667
<i>She was different</i>
 <i>than the other fillies.</i>

01:42:43.733 --> 01:42:47.833
<i>She was wilder, more independent.</i>
 <i>It was not easy to catch her.</i>

01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:50.867
Bringing her to the group was tough.
She used to have her way all the time.

01:42:51.833 --> 01:42:54.567
<i>Then she drank</i>
 <i>the group's water, ate its bread.</i>

01:42:54.633 --> 01:42:55.900
<i>She became tame.</i>

01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:57.933
As she believed...

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.633
...as she trusted, she understood
how important she was to me.

01:43:01.267 --> 01:43:02.433
Now she is yours.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:06.367
And if you approve,
I gave her the name Sultan.

01:43:06.433 --> 01:43:08.567
God willing, you will never be separated.

01:43:12.933 --> 01:43:14.533
<i>We have a long way to go together.</i>

01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:18.800
Even if the end of it is apparent,
the way is still ours.

01:43:19.767 --> 01:43:21.067
I will care for her a great deal.

01:43:21.833 --> 01:43:24.067
She will live with me
till the day that I die.

01:44:06.667 --> 01:44:07.733
You, over there.

01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:10.067
You, to the other side.
And you come with me.

01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:50.400
Ertugrul!

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:53.033
Do not act foolishly.

01:44:53.833 --> 01:44:55.533
Remember why we came here.

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:05.467
I must talk to Shahzade Numan, brother.

01:45:06.267 --> 01:45:09.633
We can’t let him be the Templars' toy
in order to rescue his daughter.

01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:13.667
Wait for the morning.
Wait till I meet with El Aziz.

01:45:14.567 --> 01:45:15.900
I can’t wait for the morning.

01:45:15.967 --> 01:45:17.833
Too late. I must go to the palace.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:19.733
Ertugrul, this is madness.

01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:23.833
Remember what happened last time.
If you end up in the dungeon again...

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.833
...we won’t be able to
rescue you this time.

01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:36.600
I must go to the palace, brother.

01:45:52.267 --> 01:45:56.467
As you’re determined to go,
let me do whatever it needs to be done.

01:46:44.767 --> 01:46:47.467
They are bringing Shahzade Yigit, Bey.

01:46:47.533 --> 01:46:48.967
Okay, go back to your place.

01:46:54.767 --> 01:46:56.733
Hush, they are coming.

01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:58.033
Go to your ambush positions.

01:47:08.267 --> 01:47:09.333
Trap!

01:47:19.967 --> 01:47:21.400
Trap!

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:34.500
Both of my sons are with Aykiz.

01:47:35.667 --> 01:47:37.333
They are more than siblings.

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.267
I know Bey, I know.

01:47:42.333 --> 01:47:46.767
They must have forgotten their problems
already trying to help my mad daughter.

01:47:48.767 --> 01:47:50.400
Put your heart at ease.

01:47:51.667 --> 01:47:54.300
What I fear is not
about my daughter, Bey.

01:47:55.467 --> 01:47:57.700
Although it is the first time
she goes to war...

01:47:57.767 --> 01:48:02.967
...she learned how to ride a horse,
fight with swords and shoot arrows...

01:48:03.033 --> 01:48:05.067
...together with her brothers.

01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:09.967
With God's help, she knows
how to shoot the infidels in the eye.

01:48:10.033 --> 01:48:11.433
I'm afraid that...

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:14.900
...she'll get in Ertugrul
and Gundogdu Bey's ways.

01:48:20.333 --> 01:48:22.000
Did I say something wrong, my Bey?

01:48:23.667 --> 01:48:24.733
Don’t worry.

01:48:25.867 --> 01:48:29.833
Turgut and Aykiz will
come soon, if God permits.

01:48:32.367 --> 01:48:33.833
It's too late, Bey.

01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:36.900
May I be excused? Good night.

01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:39.600
To you too, Wild Demir, to you too.

01:48:43.967 --> 01:48:45.400
I hope nothing is wrong.

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.933
As long as we have
these madmen in the nomad group...

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.433
...neither El Aziz,
nor the bastard Templars...

01:48:55.733 --> 01:48:58.700
...nor the Mongols
can harm us, with God's help.

01:49:23.433 --> 01:49:25.667
Hurry back my beautiful daughter.

01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:28.000
Hurry back.

01:49:29.933 --> 01:49:32.367
And take your man
back from those infidels.

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.367
Hurry back.

01:49:42.667 --> 01:49:45.333
What is the matter, Dundar?
What happened?

01:49:46.433 --> 01:49:50.567
Ebu Hisham's men don't seem
trustworthy to me, Master Demir.

01:49:51.567 --> 01:49:53.400
I am not sure if I should tell my father.

01:49:55.067 --> 01:49:57.400
Come on, go to sleep. It is late.

01:49:58.466 --> 01:50:01.367
Let's see what the morning brings.

01:50:08.067 --> 01:50:09.800
Aykiz and my brother Turgut...

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:13.966
...will be back, Master Demir.
My brothers will bring them to you.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.700
Today, it is 18 years.

01:51:03.567 --> 01:51:04.800
What, sister?

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.900
18 years ago...

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:10.667
...on a bloody night like this...

01:51:11.867 --> 01:51:15.467
...Suleyman Shah murdered
our father with his own hands.

01:51:22.267 --> 01:51:25.600
The days that everyone will get what
they deserve, are about to come, Gokce.

01:51:27.067 --> 01:51:28.433
So soon.

01:52:27.367 --> 01:52:28.733
Good night, father.

01:52:29.733 --> 01:52:31.000
To you too, son.

01:52:32.433 --> 01:52:33.533
Dundar.

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:39.800
Son, tomorrow you are going
to take the herd to the new grassland.

01:52:39.867 --> 01:52:41.733
Go bed early
so you can wake up strong.

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:42.967
-Okay?
-All right mom.

01:52:43.033 --> 01:52:44.600
Come on. Sleep tight.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.833
My little Bey!

01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:06.900
Dundar?

01:53:06.967 --> 01:53:09.400
Oh Rahman Agha, please be quiet, please.

01:53:10.567 --> 01:53:12.533
Your father will hang me
if he hears about it.

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.533
You can handle it, please.

01:53:22.467 --> 01:53:24.500
Oh God almighty!

01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:42.267
It has been 18 years.

01:53:46.533 --> 01:53:47.633
I know...

01:53:48.433 --> 01:53:50.400
...you don’t want  to talk about it but...

01:53:50.867 --> 01:53:52.567
Time has passed, Bey.

01:53:54.767 --> 01:53:56.767
Even the pots mildew with time.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.800
There is no benefit
in living with self-torment.

01:54:02.567 --> 01:54:05.900
Even his children have
never spoken about this matter once.

01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.300
It has fallen through the cracks.

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:14.433
If you can’t get rid of the mildew,
you must break the pot and throw it away.

01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:16.833
Is it so, wife?

01:54:18.300 --> 01:54:19.900
I killed their father.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.833
One of them was a baby
who lost her mother while giving birth.

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.033
The other one, was a grown up child.

01:54:30.433 --> 01:54:34.467
Have they ever mentioned
about this matter to you, Suleyman?

01:54:35.767 --> 01:54:39.467
Both Gokce and Selcan
knew everything about it.

01:54:41.667 --> 01:54:43.300
Because you were right.

01:54:43.367 --> 01:54:46.400
They kept quiet because
they knew you were right.

01:54:49.467 --> 01:54:50.933
You didn't kill him...

01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:54.033
...because you are a vicious
person but had no choice.

01:54:55.333 --> 01:54:57.633
They know this very well.

01:55:03.467 --> 01:55:06.767
I have never sat down and
talked to them about this matter once.

01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:10.067
I didn't have the courage.

01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:13.967
Sometimes the anguish of not talking...

01:55:15.433 --> 01:55:18.033
...suppresses the anguish of talking.

01:55:19.967 --> 01:55:22.533
You brought them up
as if they were your own daughters.

01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:27.433
You even had your son
got married to one of them.

01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:31.700
Gokce is another heartache.

01:55:37.067 --> 01:55:40.600
Has Ertugrul talked to you about Gokce?

01:55:42.367 --> 01:55:44.967
He is afraid to talk as much as I am.

01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:53.667
He knows that I only say once and never
take a step back about their marriage.

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:20.467
<i>Suleyman Shah...</i>

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.933
<i>...I couldn’t keep</i>
 <i>your son's seed in my womb...</i>

01:56:26.333 --> 01:56:31.267
<i>...but every single day</i>
 <i>I kept growing my revenge inside me...</i>

01:56:32.033 --> 01:56:37.033
<i>...like the grandson you always wanted.</i>

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.867
The holy birth day has come.

01:58:33.050 --> 01:58:35.016
I said I would take my revenge, brother.

01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:40.783
Rest in peace in your grave, Bisol.

01:59:39.850 --> 01:59:40.850
Untie him.

01:59:59.116 --> 02:00:00.150
Kneel down!

02:00:04.683 --> 02:00:07.883
If you want your magic water, kneel down.

02:00:38.983 --> 02:00:43.683
Welcome among God's brave servants, son.

02:01:20.983 --> 02:01:22.316
We have two martyrs.

02:01:28.016 --> 02:01:32.250
We have to obstruct Shahzade's daughter
and El Aziz getting married.

02:01:34.716 --> 02:01:37.050
Whatever it takes for it,
must be done. Understood?

02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:06.383
You will do whatever it takes, huh?

02:02:20.050 --> 02:02:23.783
If only every other villain
who has betrayed their state...

02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:31.050
...was as brave and supporting
their state as you, Afsin.

02:03:11.650 --> 02:03:12.883
Ertugrul Bey.

02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:16.083
Follow me.

02:04:25.383 --> 02:04:27.416
I am so sorry that
I have tattled on you...

02:04:27.650 --> 02:04:30.083
...and my daughter Leyla
to His Highness El Aziz.

02:04:30.916 --> 02:04:32.350
Forgive me.

02:04:32.416 --> 02:04:36.116
I talked to my daughter Leyla, and also
to my brother His Highness Halebi.

02:04:37.150 --> 02:04:40.650
They told me everything.
They helped me realize my mistakes.

02:04:40.716 --> 02:04:44.750
That's why I volunteered the mission of
taking you into the palace myself...

02:04:44.816 --> 02:04:47.916
...upon His Highness
Halebi's request. Don’t worry...

02:04:48.916 --> 02:04:50.850
...I will take you to Shahzade Numan.

02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:54.950
But, no one should know
that I took you into the palace.

02:04:56.216 --> 02:04:59.216
Nasir took the precautions
in the palace to the highest level.

02:04:59.283 --> 02:05:01.716
It is even impossible
to breathe in the palace.

02:05:02.316 --> 02:05:04.016
We must be very careful.

02:05:05.783 --> 02:05:08.416
I hope what you say and
what you have in mind are the same.

02:05:08.650 --> 02:05:13.216
Or you would be putting
not only Leyla, but also all of at risk.

02:05:14.683 --> 02:05:16.816
Including El Aziz, whom you brought up.

02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:37.350
Sir, the Seljuks are involved in this.

02:05:39.083 --> 02:05:41.450
They must have learned
that you are getting married.

02:05:43.316 --> 02:05:45.150
They had ambushed Ebu Hisham's men...

02:05:45.216 --> 02:05:48.083
...who are bringing the Shahzade
in order to obstruct it.

02:05:50.383 --> 02:05:52.283
How did the Seljuks learn about it?

02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:55.416
How could they set such a trap in my city?

02:06:02.183 --> 02:06:06.950
Treachery is streaming
in the veins of my city instead of rain.

02:06:10.816 --> 02:06:13.716
My enemies know
my most confidential secrets.

02:06:17.950 --> 02:06:19.283
Is the little Shahzade fine?

02:06:19.983 --> 02:06:21.083
He is fine, sir.

02:06:22.216 --> 02:06:25.416
-He is ready to come into your presence.
-Tell him to come.

02:07:12.816 --> 02:07:14.783
My Shahzade, here you are.

02:07:36.650 --> 02:07:37.883
My Shahzade.

02:07:39.050 --> 02:07:40.416
Welcome to my palace.

02:07:42.250 --> 02:07:44.083
Can I see my father and sister?

02:07:44.883 --> 02:07:45.883
Nasir.

02:07:46.316 --> 02:07:48.850
Tell them to get
our little Shahzade ready.

02:07:50.650 --> 02:07:53.083
Let's bring him to his loved ones.

02:07:53.150 --> 02:07:54.250
Aye, sir.

02:07:55.183 --> 02:07:56.250
My Shahzade.

02:07:58.750 --> 02:08:00.116
After you. Let's go.

02:08:28.083 --> 02:08:29.383
Ertugrul!

02:08:37.416 --> 02:08:39.816
Seeing you are alive
made me so happy, son.

02:08:40.450 --> 02:08:42.050
-Thank God!
-Thank you.

02:08:45.783 --> 02:08:46.983
I learned what happened.

02:08:49.016 --> 02:08:50.083
Halime and...

02:08:51.950 --> 02:08:53.150
...El Aziz's...

02:08:59.216 --> 02:09:00.716
Hasn't your daughter come?

02:09:01.716 --> 02:09:03.916
She was sleeping.
I did not want to wake her up.

02:09:06.983 --> 02:09:09.316
I can imagine that
this is not be easy for you.

02:09:12.083 --> 02:09:15.216
But, as you would appreciate,
the final decision is my daughter's.

02:09:16.450 --> 02:09:18.850
I didn't give a decisions
without consulting her.

02:09:19.783 --> 02:09:21.950
They are trying to
drag you into a big trap.

02:09:22.883 --> 02:09:26.250
Not only you but also
the Seljuk Empire and the Islamic world.

02:09:27.116 --> 02:09:30.316
Don't you think this proposal is
noteworthy just before the Crusades?

02:09:31.450 --> 02:09:33.383
What trap? What are you talking about?

02:09:34.383 --> 02:09:37.316
This is nothing but a set-up
by the Templars, my Shahzade.

02:09:43.183 --> 02:09:45.883
The great love you feel for my daughter...

02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:48.050
...makes you talk like that, Ertugrul Bey.

02:09:49.183 --> 02:09:50.250
And I respect that.

02:09:51.883 --> 02:09:57.816
I am a believer devout enough to know
that the most sublime degree is love.

02:10:01.116 --> 02:10:05.416
But, as I said, my daughter
will make the final decision.

02:10:12.250 --> 02:10:14.850
A game is being pulled
on you by using your daughter.

02:10:15.283 --> 02:10:17.683
Think about
the catastrophes that will follow.

02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:21.383
The game they are willing to pull on
to set Seljuks against Ayyubids...

02:10:21.450 --> 02:10:22.783
Enough!

02:10:27.650 --> 02:10:31.150
Damn their conspiracies and their states!

02:10:32.283 --> 02:10:33.950
Yigit is my son.

02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:37.050
Decision is my daughter's.

02:10:39.183 --> 02:10:42.383
Based on our relations
in the past, I request you...

02:10:44.116 --> 02:10:47.916
...to get off my and my daughters' backs.

02:10:51.216 --> 02:10:52.316
Go away.

02:10:53.450 --> 02:10:56.150
If you ever dare to appear
before me again...

02:10:56.216 --> 02:10:58.750
...I will surrender you to El Aziz myself.

02:11:27.383 --> 02:11:28.416
<i>Yigit!</i>

02:11:39.283 --> 02:11:40.283
Sister!

02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:29.683
My Yigit!
