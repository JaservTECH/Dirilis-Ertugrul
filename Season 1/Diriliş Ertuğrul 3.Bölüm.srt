Episode 3 will start at 12:34

0:12:33.472 --> 0:12:38.138
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

0:12:38.556 --> 0:12:42.390
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

0:12:42.565 --> 0:12:45.765
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

0:12:46.566 --> 0:12:47.733
Deal with the loot!

0:12:48.033 --> 0:12:49.066
Come on!

0:12:53.133 --> 0:12:55.900
Shame. Shame on you!

0:12:58.533 --> 0:13:02.933
You did not deserve any of this, Gundogdu.
I told your father.

0:13:03.733 --> 0:13:07.766
I said, “if you don’t give the prisoners
I will make the sky fall on you.”

0:13:08.833 --> 0:13:14.833
Now he can make a decision.
Will he choose his customs or his own son?

0:13:35.133 --> 0:13:36.266
Catch him!

0:13:36.666 --> 0:13:39.766
Stop him! Stop him!

0:14:26.566 --> 0:14:30.266
<i>The whole tribe is starving.</i>
 <i>Famine is everywhere.</i>

0:14:30.833 --> 0:14:33.500
<i>We could not even go on a foray. Why?</i>

0:14:34.533 --> 0:14:37.000
<i>Because our Bey has a boil problem.</i>

0:14:37.133 --> 0:14:40.000
<i>The whole tribe complains</i>
 <i>about your old age.</i>

0:15:23.033 --> 0:15:26.900
I told you that I would succeed and
make you proud. I have, father.

0:15:47.766 --> 0:15:49.200
My prayers are answered.

0:15:53.200 --> 0:15:54.766
Thank God they have.

0:15:55.500 --> 0:15:59.000
We have a winter territory now
but our job will not be easy.

0:15:59.200 --> 0:16:02.900
Kayi does not seek things that are easy,
son. With God’s help...

0:16:03.066 --> 0:16:06.900
...we can overcome any obstacle.
-With God’s help, we can.

0:16:18.966 --> 0:16:23.066
Welcome, my brave son.
You came with this good news...

0:16:23.833 --> 0:16:26.766
...may God make you happy
in this world and next.

0:16:27.066 --> 0:16:30.900
May your clan grow, may your progeny grow.

0:16:32.133 --> 0:16:34.800
Mother, my life.

0:16:35.833 --> 0:16:37.766
I would die for you, mother.

0:16:38.566 --> 0:16:41.033
May God let you lead us till the end.

0:16:44.633 --> 0:16:46.000
May God protect you.

0:16:50.500 --> 0:16:52.200
Now you can go and rest.

0:16:54.733 --> 0:16:59.266
You will attend the headquarters. You will
personally announce the good news...

0:16:59.600 --> 0:17:01.700
...from Aleppo to all Beys of Kayi.

0:17:02.000 --> 0:17:06.066
Then we can talk about
the problems in detail. Altogether.

0:17:08.300 --> 0:17:12.100
If you have permission,
I have a small job before I go to my tent.

0:17:12.266 --> 0:17:14.533
I would like to address that first.

0:19:06.200 --> 0:19:08.066
God, I am very grateful.

0:19:12.033 --> 0:19:15.800
Just when all our hopes had died,
you made Ertugrul appear before us.

0:19:18.566 --> 0:19:20.900
You made him strong against the tyrants.

0:19:24.000 --> 0:19:27.266
Now ordain him to return safely
with good news.

0:19:41.133 --> 0:19:42.566
Ertugrul?

0:19:43.000 --> 0:19:45.033
Aykiz told me that you were here.

0:19:46.600 --> 0:19:50.033
-Did I scare you?
-I was not scared but...

0:19:52.766 --> 0:19:54.800
...surprised. You came so quickly.

0:19:55.066 --> 0:19:59.666
I had told you that I would not rest
and return as soon as possible.

0:20:02.066 --> 0:20:03.233
You did.

0:20:03.866 --> 0:20:05.200
I kept my promise.

0:20:43.266 --> 0:20:45.500
Did you bring good news from Aleppo?

0:20:46.033 --> 0:20:47.800
Is there a new home to go to?

0:20:48.700 --> 0:20:49.833
Yes.

0:20:51.866 --> 0:20:53.100
Thank God.

0:20:56.300 --> 0:20:58.866
The tribe will find some peace at the end.

0:21:00.033 --> 0:21:02.233
Everyone was waiting for your return.

0:21:04.133 --> 0:21:05.633
Especially Aykiz.

0:21:07.100 --> 0:21:08.600
Especially Aykiz?

0:21:11.533 --> 0:21:12.833
I mean...

0:21:14.666 --> 0:21:19.933
...your mother and father. The babies
who were getting cold in the highlands.

0:21:21.533 --> 0:21:22.733
Everyone.

0:21:25.066 --> 0:21:26.533
All of us.

0:21:51.833 --> 0:21:53.266
I never parted from it.

0:21:55.933 --> 0:21:58.700
It gave me strength in every obstacle
I faced.

0:22:01.200 --> 0:22:05.000
Anytime I felt in distraught,
it reminded me that you are with me.

0:22:18.533 --> 0:22:20.566
I brought this from Aleppo for you.

0:22:23.300 --> 0:22:24.733
For me?

0:22:45.133 --> 0:22:47.133
This is so beautiful, Ertugrul Bey.

0:22:57.666 --> 0:23:00.300
I wanted you to see the beauty that I do.

0:23:21.833 --> 0:23:23.600
Everything is like a dream.

0:23:33.133 --> 0:23:35.500
But like all dreams, this will end.

0:23:37.066 --> 0:23:38.733
What happened, Halime?

0:23:39.100 --> 0:23:40.800
What is it that bothers you?

0:23:45.700 --> 0:23:46.866
Karatoygar.

0:23:49.833 --> 0:23:51.900
He raided the tribe to kidnap us.

0:23:53.133 --> 0:23:55.766
He will not rest until he catches us,
Ertugrul.

0:24:04.166 --> 0:24:05.766
You can be rest assured.

0:24:07.666 --> 0:24:11.066
I promise you that I will never leave you.

0:24:22.033 --> 0:24:24.533
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS
TEMPLARS CASTLE

0:24:52.000 --> 0:24:54.533
Today is the anniversary
of my father’s death.

0:24:54.866 --> 0:24:56.533
It has been eight years.

0:24:58.600 --> 0:25:02.266
I wish he had a grave,
where I could weep and pray.

0:25:03.900 --> 0:25:08.200
You should not pray for your father’s
death, you should pray that he lives.

0:25:22.933 --> 0:25:26.000
No one has ever seen
your father’s dead body until now.

0:25:26.666 --> 0:25:28.833
Maybe he is still alive.

0:25:29.600 --> 0:25:34.100
Maybe the hope of seeing his daughter
once again is keeping him alive.

0:27:04.100 --> 0:27:06.766
When did he come and
meet with that ominous girl?

0:27:10.800 --> 0:27:12.500
May it be easy, Hatuns.

0:27:21.000 --> 0:27:24.866
Ertugrul Bey ran off to see that girl
as soon as he arrived, mother.

0:27:25.300 --> 0:27:28.800
Where did they go?
How can they walk side by side like this?

0:27:30.633 --> 0:27:34.166
Don’t think of malice
before you have your facts right, Selcan.

0:27:35.066 --> 0:27:36.900
No one would benefit from it.

0:27:38.133 --> 0:27:40.933
Ertugrul came and kissed our hands first.

0:27:42.166 --> 0:27:45.833
We have to deal with this guest problem
as soon as possible, mother.

0:27:46.233 --> 0:27:49.233
My father in law does not know
or see these things.

0:27:49.599 --> 0:27:52.066
This girl has bad intentions
against our family.

0:27:53.766 --> 0:27:58.200
Let your hands work instead of
your tongues. There is a lot to do.

0:28:22.266 --> 0:28:24.600
What did Suleyman Shah say, Bey?

0:28:26.700 --> 0:28:28.566
Ertugrul returned from Aleppo.

0:28:29.933 --> 0:28:31.933
He got a territory from El Aziz.

0:28:32.766 --> 0:28:35.700
Ertugrul turned out to be
more capable than we thought.

0:28:35.900 --> 0:28:39.066
Do you think Kurdoglu Bey’s
bag of tricks have run out?

0:28:40.766 --> 0:28:42.933
Of course we have a plan as well.

0:29:07.266 --> 0:29:11.066
Wild  Demir,
the heretic’s sword is bigger than yours.

0:29:11.300 --> 0:29:14.866
Dogan, where did you find
this donkey stick?

0:29:15.100 --> 0:29:17.033
From the Crusaders we killed.

0:29:17.966 --> 0:29:20.633
Infidels don’t know
the first thing about a sword.

0:29:22.066 --> 0:29:24.066
A weapon should be like this.

0:29:24.600 --> 0:29:26.833
It should be curved like aleph.

0:29:27.000 --> 0:29:29.100
It should be comfortable on the wrist.

0:29:29.300 --> 0:29:31.200
It should be a head to steel.

0:29:38.633 --> 0:29:42.666
Karatoygar’s men raided Halime’s tent,
Wild Demir. Is this true?

0:29:45.233 --> 0:29:51.666
It is true, Ertugrul. The dog did
his thing but he was defeated.

0:29:55.300 --> 0:29:57.966
I entrusted that tent’s honor with you.

0:29:58.833 --> 0:30:02.000
How can they come and
raid the tent right under our noses?

0:30:02.233 --> 0:30:06.700
You are right, Ertugrul. Whatever you say.

0:30:07.866 --> 0:30:11.666
A negligence on my part.
You can punish me.

0:30:13.133 --> 0:30:15.000
I deserve what I will get.

0:30:22.100 --> 0:30:24.300
I still have to thank you, Master Demir.

0:30:25.166 --> 0:30:27.600
Their life were saved thanks to you.

0:30:27.766 --> 0:30:32.566
No, not only me. There was Afsin as well.

0:30:33.500 --> 0:30:36.100
The man of the trader
who came to the tribe.

0:30:36.266 --> 0:30:39.933
But please know this, Ertugrul,
even a bad thing may be a good deed.

0:30:40.100 --> 0:30:44.766
If those rabid dogs didn’t come
to the tribe to attack Halime’s family...

0:30:45.600 --> 0:30:48.766
...that night they were going to run away.

0:30:50.833 --> 0:30:55.800
What if the dogs attacked them somewhere
else outside the tribe?

0:30:56.066 --> 0:30:58.200
We would not have been aware of it.

0:31:00.600 --> 0:31:01.966
Halime’s family...

0:31:05.166 --> 0:31:06.800
...were going to run away?

0:31:19.966 --> 0:31:22.800
Did Afsin kill all those dogs by himself?

0:31:24.900 --> 0:31:26.933
Look at the helper of a trader.

0:31:43.233 --> 0:31:44.500
Halime...

0:31:47.700 --> 0:31:50.566
...Ertugrul Bey asked for you
the minute he came.

0:31:51.000 --> 0:31:53.666
You should have seen
how fast he went after you.

0:31:54.233 --> 0:31:56.733
Turgut and I are going to meet in a while.

0:31:56.933 --> 0:31:59.700
My heart always skips
a beat when he is away.

0:32:00.166 --> 0:32:04.200
Thank God, they returned safe and sound.
And with good news as well.

0:32:04.966 --> 0:32:06.866
Patience is a virtue, Aykiz.

0:32:07.033 --> 0:32:11.100
Our wedding will be soon.
My hands have gone cold from excitement.

0:32:15.666 --> 0:32:17.266
Did Ertugrul Bey buy this?

0:32:21.600 --> 0:32:22.966
It is so nice.

0:32:24.200 --> 0:32:27.066
So he was thinking about
you even over there.

0:32:27.900 --> 0:32:29.766
So what if he thinks, Aykiz?

0:32:30.866 --> 0:32:33.300
Why do you talk like this, dear Halime?

0:32:36.733 --> 0:32:39.033
It is obvious that
you are not in the mood.

0:32:40.133 --> 0:32:42.500
Did something happen and hurt you?

0:32:45.666 --> 0:32:49.666
I had to run away for my all life
so that we don’t get hurt.

0:32:54.033 --> 0:32:57.266
This is the first time I am hurting
because I have to leave.

0:33:01.900 --> 0:33:05.866
I do not know from whom
or why you are running away.

0:33:08.566 --> 0:33:11.133
If you want the truth, I don’t care.

0:33:12.500 --> 0:33:14.566
But I know one thing, Halime...

0:33:14.933 --> 0:33:16.766
...you are not alone anymore.

0:33:18.633 --> 0:33:22.966
Ertugrul Bey would not let you go
or let something happen to you.

0:33:45.700 --> 0:33:47.033
Elanora...

0:33:47.900 --> 0:33:49.266
...you are in sorrow.

0:33:50.166 --> 0:33:53.800
Your sorrow even made my pigeons uneasy.

0:33:55.833 --> 0:33:57.900
I am in the lands where my father died.

0:33:58.066 --> 0:34:00.266
I want to pray by his grave for once.

0:34:00.666 --> 0:34:07.666
Knight Giovanni was the wisest and
the bravest knight I had ever seen.

0:34:08.833 --> 0:34:13.000
You were the last person to see
my father before the Turks killed him.

0:34:13.300 --> 0:34:17.200
They blinded me with hot iron rod
and left me to my fate.

0:34:18.133 --> 0:34:22.933
Before I was blinded for good,
the last thing I saw was your father.

0:34:26.666 --> 0:34:28.500
What if my father did not die?

0:34:28.633 --> 0:34:32.133
I buried your father in a grave
I dug with my hands...

0:34:32.300 --> 0:34:34.900
...while blood was seeping from my eyes.

0:34:35.500 --> 0:34:38.266
You are saying you buried
my father when you were blind.

0:34:38.600 --> 0:34:42.500
What if the person who you thought you
buried was not my father but someone else?

0:34:42.666 --> 0:34:45.833
How can I not recognize
the master I worked for years?

0:34:47.066 --> 0:34:48.233
I need to go.

0:34:50.166 --> 0:34:52.033
With your permission, my girl.

0:35:03.133 --> 0:35:04.633
Farewell, Elanora.

0:35:08.766 --> 0:35:11.900
I am going to a mission and
I cannot return until it is completed.

0:35:12.666 --> 0:35:14.300
I wanted to bid you farewell.

0:35:17.500 --> 0:35:19.133
I will pray for your return.

0:35:27.566 --> 0:35:28.566
Titus.

0:35:33.933 --> 0:35:36.933
I want you to send this letter
to my sister Isadora.

0:36:05.900 --> 0:36:09.033
She has suspicions about
the death of her father, sir.

0:36:10.000 --> 0:36:13.900
She is trying to find a contradiction
in my statements by asking questions.

0:36:14.133 --> 0:36:17.900
I want to be informed about
every step Elanora takes, Mario.

0:36:52.500 --> 0:36:53.633
Gokce.

0:37:00.866 --> 0:37:04.666
Mother Hayme wanted to ask you whether
your heart is with Ertugrul or not.

0:37:05.066 --> 0:37:09.766
You should come to your senses. Don’t hide
in the corners and eat yourself up.

0:37:12.066 --> 0:37:14.500
When I saw them together like that...

0:37:16.666 --> 0:37:18.633
So she inquired my feelings?

0:37:19.666 --> 0:37:22.533
This mission is over. You will not hide.

0:37:22.700 --> 0:37:26.166
You should be seen by Ertugrul
in every occasion.

0:37:28.233 --> 0:37:31.200
Sister, Ertugrul’s heart is with Halime.

0:37:32.700 --> 0:37:34.866
You see and know this as well.

0:37:35.766 --> 0:37:39.133
His mother might have inquired me
but I know...

0:37:40.800 --> 0:37:42.966
...the son will not want to marry me.

0:37:43.166 --> 0:37:45.866
My beautiful Baci, my naive Baci.

0:37:46.100 --> 0:37:51.100
Who is asking Ertugrul?
If Suleyman Shah tells him to marry you...

0:37:51.233 --> 0:37:53.300
...how can he object?

0:37:55.733 --> 0:37:58.066
-He cannot, can he?
-Of course not.

0:37:58.866 --> 0:38:03.533
When a wedding decision comes out of
Suleyman Shah’s mouth, it is final.

0:38:04.700 --> 0:38:09.000
Have you ever seen Ertugrul oppose
his father up to this day?

0:38:10.266 --> 0:38:13.833
Your wedding is soon, Gokce.
Do not eat up yourself.

0:38:14.000 --> 0:38:17.800
When Gundogdu returns home,
we can engage you and Ertugrul.

0:38:19.633 --> 0:38:21.200
Do we have permission, Yenge?

0:38:23.633 --> 0:38:24.833
Come in, Bey.

0:38:27.533 --> 0:38:29.500
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

0:38:30.233 --> 0:38:33.633
I wanted to see how you are.
I hope you are well, if God permits.

0:38:33.800 --> 0:38:36.500
We are better now that we see you,
Ertugrul Bey.

0:38:36.800 --> 0:38:39.900
-You got us a territory from Aleppo.
-We did, thank God.

0:38:40.700 --> 0:38:43.666
When my brother returns
with the caravan, we can migrate.

0:38:43.800 --> 0:38:46.733
-Let him return safe and sound.
-He will, if God permits.

0:41:23.300 --> 0:41:24.633
Yes but, Bey...

0:41:24.800 --> 0:41:27.766
...the whole tribe wants a new territory.
Winter is at our door.

0:41:27.900 --> 0:41:31.600
What can we do apart from migrating to
Aleppo? Do you know another way out?

0:41:31.833 --> 0:41:36.633
Do you know how many Turkmen tribes
serve in the Mongol army, Alpargu?

0:41:37.300 --> 0:41:39.666
-No, I do not.
-But I do.

0:41:41.500 --> 0:41:45.600
Instead of conceding to Ertugrul's mind
and being stuffed into a snake hole...

0:41:45.766 --> 0:41:48.833
...we can turn back and
make a deal with the Mongol commanders.

0:41:48.966 --> 0:41:52.833
Why should Kayis be the guard dogs of
Aleppo putting forward their chests...

0:41:52.966 --> 0:41:57.066
...as shields to Templar’s swords?
Or shall we do what scores of tribes...

0:41:57.266 --> 0:42:01.533
...are doing and foray
the Rome territory from end to end?

0:42:01.866 --> 0:42:05.233
But Bey, did not the Mongols
shed our blood tens of times?

0:42:05.533 --> 0:42:07.266
This time will be different!

0:42:08.066 --> 0:42:13.566
We have to risk making a deal with even
the devil for the future of our tribe.

0:42:15.066 --> 0:42:16.533
Do not forget...

0:42:17.166 --> 0:42:19.133
...we do everything for our tribe.

0:42:22.600 --> 0:42:26.500
Now go and talk with
that simpleton called Baybora.

0:42:29.533 --> 0:42:32.833
And don’t let the gimmicks of yesterday’s
child affect you.

0:42:32.966 --> 0:42:36.233
Today I will keep quiet and
you will talk in the headquarters.

0:42:36.933 --> 0:42:42.533
While Ertugrul talks about his sweet
victory, you should shake him up a bit.

0:42:44.200 --> 0:42:47.266
This way we can also see
the reactions of the clan Beys.

0:42:48.133 --> 0:42:51.233
Let us see how many will join in
your opposing views.

0:44:26.800 --> 0:44:27.933
Stop!

0:44:28.866 --> 0:44:30.700
Karatoygar wants him alive.

0:44:32.300 --> 0:44:33.600
Take him away.

0:44:53.666 --> 0:44:55.833
We will be a burden to you, Ilyas Fakih.

0:44:56.699 --> 0:44:59.600
You will have to put up with us
until the tribe migrates.

0:44:59.766 --> 0:45:03.300
Don’t make a big deal out of it.
We will just sleep quietly in a corner.

0:45:04.933 --> 0:45:06.833
You are always welcome, brothers.

0:45:07.500 --> 0:45:10.100
Turgut, what will Ertugrul Bey
talk to me about?

0:45:17.933 --> 0:45:20.000
I see that you made yourself at home.

0:45:20.900 --> 0:45:22.866
Do not test Ilyas Fakih’s patience.

0:45:22.966 --> 0:45:24.266
Try to be tidy.

0:45:26.033 --> 0:45:30.066
-Do you know what happened back here?
-Yes, Bey. Turgut told me everything.

0:45:31.833 --> 0:45:34.166
It is obvious that Karatoygar
has a man inside.

0:45:34.300 --> 0:45:37.600
He gave them the courage to raid
the tribe while we were away.

0:45:37.766 --> 0:45:40.033
We need someone who will not
attract attention.

0:45:40.166 --> 0:45:41.766
Just the job for us, Bey.

0:45:41.866 --> 0:45:45.033
Will you do this job with
that body and bandit face of yours?

0:45:46.900 --> 0:45:48.866
Is there someone our Bey suspects?

0:45:49.000 --> 0:45:50.833
Yes. Afsin.

0:45:51.800 --> 0:45:52.900
Trader’s man.

0:45:53.600 --> 0:45:56.233
He stayed in the tribe
after saving Halime’s family.

0:45:57.133 --> 0:45:58.900
I want to know who he is.

0:45:59.700 --> 0:46:03.200
Of course, Bey. Do not worry about it.
I will breath down his neck.

0:46:55.200 --> 0:46:57.100
I came for permission, sir.

0:46:57.900 --> 0:46:59.233
Time for the mission.

0:47:04.500 --> 0:47:09.266
I will finalize the job that I left
incomplete. I will do it silently.

0:47:10.033 --> 0:47:13.766
Nurture the feeling of revenge inside you
like a newborn baby.

0:47:13.933 --> 0:47:17.066
But never let it precede your mission.

0:47:20.266 --> 0:47:23.133
Stop the Turks from settling at
our borders.

0:47:49.200 --> 0:47:54.833
In the 99 names of our Great God,
Who creates with only saying “let be”...

0:47:55.000 --> 0:47:58.800
...Who fills our hearts with belief.
In the name of God.

0:47:59.266 --> 0:48:01.866
In the name of God,
most Merciful and most Graceful.

0:48:02.033 --> 0:48:03.533
You may speak, Ertugrul.

0:48:05.000 --> 0:48:09.000
Our new land is like the ones described
in the legends of our forefathers.

0:48:10.000 --> 0:48:13.800
Very secure as described. Surrounded by
mountains on all four sides.

0:48:14.166 --> 0:48:17.700
The people of the region even named
the place as Wind Stopper.

0:48:17.966 --> 0:48:20.966
Then, if you even squeeze a stone,
water would drip.

0:48:21.166 --> 0:48:23.233
It is such a fertile land.

0:48:24.166 --> 0:48:28.233
A heaven on earth where our ponies can
freely roam and our herds can fatten...

0:48:28.533 --> 0:48:30.066
...after the harsh winter.

0:48:30.200 --> 0:48:33.633
-May God bless you.
-Thank you, bless you.

0:48:34.900 --> 0:48:37.800
All problems are not solved
with getting the land.

0:48:38.000 --> 0:48:41.966
Our new territory is fertile
but it is also fertile in enemies too.

0:48:42.633 --> 0:48:45.233
It is at the border of
the Crusader Countship.

0:48:45.566 --> 0:48:50.000
While our children and herds grow,
the ploys around us will grow as well.

0:48:50.500 --> 0:48:56.833
If that is so, why do you talk about
our legends and confuse our minds?

0:48:57.766 --> 0:48:59.933
Yes, Alpargu is right.

0:49:00.100 --> 0:49:02.566
-He is right.
-He tells the truth.

0:49:04.500 --> 0:49:07.233
We want a home, not a grave.

0:49:11.533 --> 0:49:14.900
What makes land a home
is the grave, Baybora.

0:49:16.566 --> 0:49:20.000
We should have graves so that
the land can be our territory...

0:49:20.200 --> 0:49:23.800
...and our territory be our homeland.
-Wild Demir speaks the truth.

0:49:23.966 --> 0:49:26.233
-Yes, he is right.
-I think so too.

0:49:26.833 --> 0:49:28.800
You are wrong, Alpargu Bey.

0:49:29.200 --> 0:49:32.266
Did you think the sagas of
our forefathers are fables?

0:49:32.566 --> 0:49:36.300
They are not for making the babies sleep,
they are for awaking the grownups.

0:49:36.800 --> 0:49:40.100
From them we learned how to cultivate
the fertile lands as well as...

0:49:40.266 --> 0:49:42.633
...how to melt the surrounding
iron mountains.

0:49:52.066 --> 0:49:53.700
What do you say, Kurdoglu?

0:49:56.033 --> 0:49:57.733
Ertugrul is right, Bey.

0:49:58.166 --> 0:50:02.266
The presence of an enemy gives us
the chance to be veterans and martyrs...

0:50:02.633 --> 0:50:08.233
...praise to God. It would strengthen our
tribe. We can collect booty from around.

0:50:12.633 --> 0:50:14.300
Is there anyone who objects?

0:50:22.000 --> 0:50:23.766
As everyone agrees...

0:50:24.733 --> 0:50:26.900
...let the migration preparations start.

0:50:29.700 --> 0:50:32.666
{\an8}KARATOYGAR INN

0:50:41.633 --> 0:50:43.500
Come close, Gundogdu.

0:50:45.500 --> 0:50:47.700
I can see the rage in your eyes.

0:50:48.300 --> 0:50:51.633
Is that rage towards me or your father?

0:50:52.933 --> 0:50:56.300
I do not like to lie about my feelings.

0:51:01.866 --> 0:51:05.033
There is really no need for all these,
Gundogdu.

0:51:05.733 --> 0:51:12.533
God forbid, if something happens
to your old father in the near future...

0:51:13.500 --> 0:51:17.766
...wouldn’t it be better for you to lead
the Kayi tribe in the future?

0:51:18.933 --> 0:51:21.200
If I were to become a Bey one day...

0:51:21.833 --> 0:51:25.900
...I would skin you alive and
feed you to the dogs.

0:51:28.000 --> 0:51:29.633
Interesting.

0:51:32.700 --> 0:51:38.233
When I came to the tribe, I thought
the growling Ertugrul was the brave one.

0:51:38.933 --> 0:51:44.166
But it is the other dog
who didn’t show his teeth then.

0:51:45.533 --> 0:51:46.700
Bring him in!

0:51:59.066 --> 0:52:00.266
Hamza.

0:52:02.933 --> 0:52:06.266
I will give your father one last chance,
Gundogdu.

0:52:07.066 --> 0:52:10.266
I will send your Alp,
Hamza to your father.

0:52:11.666 --> 0:52:18.100
I will gently propose that he should
bring the prisoners alone tomorrow.

0:52:19.266 --> 0:52:21.800
If he rejects my offer...

0:52:22.766 --> 0:52:27.966
...first you, then the whole Kayi tribe
shall be slain by our swords.

0:52:27.967 --> 0:02:16.474


0:52:29.866 --> 0:52:36.500
I will do everything
a good intentioned commander would do.

0:52:36.966 --> 0:52:39.333
This is all I can do.

0:52:46.900 --> 0:52:49.033
Do you understand me?

0:52:59.466 --> 0:53:01.400
Take them away to the prison!

0:54:01.900 --> 0:54:03.900
Eyebrows should be like bows...

0:54:04.066 --> 0:54:06.400
...and eyelashes like arrows.

0:54:06.733 --> 0:54:11.000
You should look at your man in such a way
that you should hit him in the heart.

0:54:11.733 --> 0:54:14.066
His eyes will not see any other woman.

0:54:16.866 --> 0:54:20.333
Don’t put too much.
I don’t want to look like I am wounded.

0:54:20.500 --> 0:54:23.533
Do not worry. You will be very beautiful.

0:54:23.833 --> 0:54:25.833
Just like a Bey’s wife.

0:54:27.666 --> 0:54:31.466
With your lush hair and apple cheeks...

0:54:32.700 --> 0:54:35.833
...you will glide like a swan
the whole night.

0:54:36.700 --> 0:54:40.466
Everyone will be looking at you.
But Ertugrul the most.

0:54:41.633 --> 0:54:44.500
-Will he really look at me?
-Of course he will.

0:54:45.066 --> 0:54:48.966
That is not all,
he will be hit directly from his heart.

0:54:49.300 --> 0:54:51.033
The whole world will know.

0:55:01.766 --> 0:55:03.333
Children...

0:55:03.933 --> 0:55:05.700
...once upon a time...

0:55:05.866 --> 0:55:11.766
...long before we migrated here from
the lands of our forefathers...

0:55:12.466 --> 0:55:19.100
...there was a dragon which would
slay our people, rip apart our herds...

0:55:19.566 --> 0:55:23.400
...and kill our horses.

0:55:25.366 --> 0:55:31.833
The people were shivering in fright and
asking “is there a valiant Alp...

0:55:32.033 --> 0:55:34.800
...who can save us from this monster?”

0:56:48.433 --> 0:56:52.066
Our forefather Oguz cried out,
“yes, there is! There is!”

0:56:53.400 --> 0:56:55.433
Of course he wasn’t like me.

0:56:55.633 --> 0:56:58.333
Much taller and larger.

0:56:59.733 --> 0:57:06.533
He took his bow, arrows, spear
and sword to set on the road.

0:57:11.800 --> 0:57:13.333
You know your task.

0:57:45.500 --> 0:57:48.000
Watch your manners, greet Ertugrul.

0:57:51.400 --> 0:57:55.533
Bey, may God bless you. We won’t be killed
by the cold, thanks to you.

0:57:55.766 --> 0:57:59.600
May your Alps always be behind you,
may you form a tribe with your daughter...

0:57:59.733 --> 0:58:03.666
...make an army with your son,
may God bless you, always be our leader.

0:58:03.800 --> 0:58:04.900
Amen.

0:58:09.933 --> 0:58:12.966
Look at our tall Alp.
He is locked in again.

0:58:37.066 --> 0:58:42.533
Oguz faced the dragon and said,
“look at me...

0:58:43.033 --> 0:58:47.333
...I would hit you so hard
with this sword...

0:58:47.833 --> 0:58:52.433
...your biggest part that is left
would be your ears.”

0:59:31.700 --> 0:59:35.866
The Alps shall play sword and shields
in the honor of our new land.

0:59:36.700 --> 0:59:38.766
Let our traditions live on!

1:02:39.533 --> 1:02:43.733
Suleyman Shah protected you, as it is
a custom. Our custom is like this.

1:02:44.333 --> 1:02:48.666
What about your customs? Does it include
seducing the son of a Bey...

1:02:48.833 --> 1:02:50.866
...where you are a guest?

1:02:52.300 --> 1:02:53.700
What are you saying?

1:02:53.966 --> 1:02:57.033
I said what I had said
and you understood me well.

1:04:00.666 --> 1:04:02.466
Stay away from Ertugrul.

1:04:21.633 --> 1:04:22.766
Halime.

1:04:28.300 --> 1:04:32.466
You are like an arrow which left the bow.
Do you intend to run away again?

1:04:33.766 --> 1:04:36.066
So you heard the things that happened.

1:04:36.633 --> 1:04:38.600
Yes, we tried to run away...

1:04:39.433 --> 1:04:42.700
...but unfortunately we could not.
-Nobody wants you to go.

1:04:43.666 --> 1:04:45.600
Guests are sacred for us.

1:04:45.933 --> 1:04:47.666
This is our custom.

1:04:50.066 --> 1:04:54.433
Ertugrul Bey.
We carry the dark clouds on top of us.

1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:59.633
We should go, so that the dark clouds
above your tribe can disperse.

1:04:59.766 --> 1:05:02.833
So you would have been long gone
before I came back from Aleppo.

1:05:03.066 --> 1:05:04.733
Never to be seen again.

1:05:06.100 --> 1:05:10.600
I was going to be hurt,
my heart was going to shatter but...

1:05:13.700 --> 1:05:16.433
...they will never give up their pursue,
Ertugrul.

1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:18.066
Who are they, Halime?

1:05:18.433 --> 1:05:19.899
What do they want from you?

1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:22.933
It is best if you don’t know
who we are, Ertugrul.

1:05:23.066 --> 1:05:25.033
Bey, we caught a leper.

1:05:53.666 --> 1:05:56.100
-Kill her, don’t let her live!
-Who are you, woman?

1:05:56.366 --> 1:05:59.700
We caught her while she was pouring
something in the food cauldrons, Bey.

1:05:59.800 --> 1:06:02.900
Do you want to die?
What did you put in the cauldrons? Talk!

1:06:08.666 --> 1:06:12.066
The Templar Knights
send their regards to you, Ertugrul.

1:06:25.466 --> 1:06:28.866
Put the cauldrons and
this woman in a pit and burn them all.

1:06:46.633 --> 1:06:50.633
What do these Templars want from you?
You just told us this morning that they...

1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:54.966
...tried to kill you in Aleppo, now they
try to spread their venom in our tribe.

1:06:55.500 --> 1:06:58.900
Everything started with you saving
our guests from their hands.

1:06:59.066 --> 1:07:00.666
What is this about?

1:07:02.300 --> 1:07:04.566
The problem is deeper
than it seems, father.

1:07:04.800 --> 1:07:07.666
I don’t think that
it only concerns Halime’s famiy.

1:07:07.866 --> 1:07:12.400
The real reason they attack us must be
because we will be right at their border.

1:07:13.633 --> 1:07:18.533
You don’t want to blame them but
our guests have a secret.

1:07:20.100 --> 1:07:23.100
And this secret is very dangerous.

1:07:26.066 --> 1:07:30.966
Of course they are our guests, we shall
treat them like visitors from God...

1:07:31.100 --> 1:07:33.500
...but don’t think further, Ertugrul.

1:07:34.900 --> 1:07:36.066
Father.

1:07:38.033 --> 1:07:40.833
Ertugrul, son...

1:07:42.033 --> 1:07:46.800
...you can’t have a tribe’s girl
from outside. Don’t you ever forget this.

1:07:48.366 --> 1:07:53.433
Moreover, we would like to wed you with
our girl Gokce, the first chance we get.

1:07:54.600 --> 1:07:57.900
We talked with your Mother Hayme.
I found it suitable as well.

1:08:01.766 --> 1:08:03.033
Anyhow...

1:08:05.533 --> 1:08:09.466
...the evil of the day should be preferred
over the goodness of the night.

1:08:10.033 --> 1:08:12.766
Come to the breakfast table,
we will talk then.

1:09:58.300 --> 1:10:03.733
-What makes your night a torture, son?
-Mother, what does my father say?

1:10:05.033 --> 1:10:06.966
Gokce Baci to be my wife.

1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:29.633
Gokce is a daughter of a Bey.
She grew up in our hands.

1:10:30.566 --> 1:10:34.533
We know her manners, her attitude,
her ancestors and all.

1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:36.933
You know all these, mother but...

1:10:37.100 --> 1:10:38.866
...do you know my heart?

1:10:45.966 --> 1:10:47.466
Halime...

1:10:49.733 --> 1:10:51.766
...is here today, gone tomorrow.

1:10:52.766 --> 1:10:54.833
We do not know who they are.

1:10:55.066 --> 1:10:58.800
They say that they are traders.
Your father does not object...

1:10:59.433 --> 1:11:02.866
...but he knows that they are not traders.

1:11:04.033 --> 1:11:11.000
They are guests sent by God, he says.
He does not dwell on what it may lead to.

1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:17.066
If the promise to the forefathers
is the well being of the tribe...

1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:20.700
...this means Gokce for you, no one else.

1:11:23.866 --> 1:11:27.800
Mother, God took me to her with a gazelle.

1:11:29.966 --> 1:11:32.433
How can I betray those beautiful eyes?

1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:34.300
Those sweet words?

1:11:35.366 --> 1:11:39.766
If, one day, I summon the courage
to ask her whether her heart is with me...

1:11:41.533 --> 1:11:43.966
...and she says “my path is your path”...

1:11:46.433 --> 1:11:48.366
...how can I tell her to go?

1:13:31.100 --> 1:13:32.400
Are you asleep?

1:13:34.433 --> 1:13:38.766
I would give anything
for my eyes to be shut for an instant.

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:48.666
I talked with Ertugrul.

1:13:49.766 --> 1:13:53.933
The girl’s father is better. They would
leave before the tribe migrates.

1:13:55.866 --> 1:13:57.300
Bey...

1:13:58.100 --> 1:14:02.033
...I offered Gokce as a name to you.
But I am not in peace.

1:14:04.433 --> 1:14:06.833
Ertugrul’s heart is with the other girl.

1:14:09.866 --> 1:14:12.900
An Alp’s heart is always
with his tribe, Hayme.

1:14:14.366 --> 1:14:19.433
He is young, he is hasty,
his heart may overflow with feelings.

1:14:20.733 --> 1:14:26.066
When the tribe migrates and the tents
are set, those feelings would dry up.

1:14:32.633 --> 1:14:35.033
Come on.
May God give you a peaceful sleep.

1:15:44.766 --> 1:15:46.700
What a blessed morning this is.

1:15:46.866 --> 1:15:50.500
You can be rest assured now.
Be happy that your dreams will come true.

1:15:50.900 --> 1:15:54.533
Suleyman Bey told Ertugrul
that you two should be wed.

1:15:56.733 --> 1:16:01.700
I don’t know. I have butterflies in me
flying around but at the same time...

1:16:01.833 --> 1:16:03.933
...dark clouds don’t seem to go away.

1:16:04.066 --> 1:16:07.566
Let out a big breath, get rid of
all the bad feelings inside you.

1:16:07.700 --> 1:16:11.533
This job is done. When Gundogdu returns,
there is no turning back.

1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:16.100
-Did not Ertugrul arrive yet?
-He did not, Bey. He must be in his tent.

1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:18.966
-Sit.
-My girl Gokce...

1:16:19.566 --> 1:16:22.400
...go and inform him.
He should come to breakfast.

1:16:48.033 --> 1:16:49.333
Ertugrul Bey?

1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:55.800
Ertugrul Bey?

1:17:02.433 --> 1:17:03.600
Come in, Gokce.

1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:12.733
Suleyman Shah expects you at
the breakfast table, Bey.

1:17:37.833 --> 1:17:39.400
Gokce Baci.

1:17:50.700 --> 1:17:51.900
I am coming.

1:18:30.666 --> 1:18:32.333
The agreement is done.

1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:38.466
We will give El Aziz as many Alps
as he wants...

1:18:38.866 --> 1:18:43.433
...and we'll pay the taxes. The territory
he has appointed for us is accepted.

1:18:46.300 --> 1:18:49.933
Tomorrow morning leave early
in the morning, send him my regards.

1:18:50.366 --> 1:18:54.433
Inform him that I shall pay him
a visit after we settle in our new land.

1:18:55.800 --> 1:18:57.100
As you wish, father.

1:19:08.766 --> 1:19:12.000
If God permits,
after we settle in our new land...

1:19:13.033 --> 1:19:15.066
...we shall wed you and Gokce.

1:19:21.500 --> 1:19:22.666
Well?

1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.066
I want a grandson, Ertugrul.

1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:46.900
Father?

1:19:48.933 --> 1:19:50.400
With your permission...

1:19:59.300 --> 1:20:01.000
Get up and drink some water.

1:20:04.100 --> 1:20:07.666
-I need to see our Bey.
-Wait, let me inform him.

1:20:11.433 --> 1:20:14.366
-Rahman, who is it at the door?
-Hamza arrived, Bey.

1:20:14.566 --> 1:20:16.900
-He wants to see you.
-Let him in immediately.

1:20:20.366 --> 1:20:22.300
I hope it will lead to a good deed.

1:20:25.833 --> 1:20:27.000
Bey...

1:20:27.833 --> 1:20:29.300
...Karatoygar...

1:20:31.866 --> 1:20:33.766
Karatoygar ambushed the caravan.

1:20:33.866 --> 1:20:36.100
-Karatoygar?
-What are you saying, Alp?

1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:38.900
-Where is Gundogdu?
-Where are the other Alps?

1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:42.700
They all died, Bey. All of them.

1:20:47.866 --> 1:20:52.600
-Gundogdu Bey is imprisoned by Karatoygar.
-What do you mean by imprisoned?

1:20:52.833 --> 1:20:55.433
How can you leave your Bey? How?

1:20:55.900 --> 1:20:59.666
Why did they let you go? What does
this snake called Karatoygar want?

1:21:00.766 --> 1:21:03.500
The guests Ertugrul Bey
brought to the tribe.

1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:08.966
Karatoygar wants them.

1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:15.100
If you don’t give them by tomorrow...

1:21:16.533 --> 1:21:18.466
...he will kill Gundogdu Bey.

1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:23.833
These are all your doings!
Everything is your fault!

1:21:23.966 --> 1:21:27.633
You brought those cursed people here
and all hell broke loose!

1:21:27.733 --> 1:21:29.333
Selcan!

1:21:33.300 --> 1:21:35.600
Selcan, come. Come here, my girl.

1:21:35.866 --> 1:21:40.766
Rahman, send some trusted men
to bring back our bodies.

1:21:41.433 --> 1:21:45.566
Take Hamza to a tent without anyone
seeing him. Akcakoca should treat him.

1:21:45.833 --> 1:21:50.333
I do not want anyone in the tribe to
learn what happened. And bring me Numan!

1:21:50.500 --> 1:21:51.766
As you wish, Bey!

1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.400
Ertugrul.

1:22:12.766 --> 1:22:16.033
Where is your manners? How can you enter
without seeking permission?

1:22:16.333 --> 1:22:19.400
-Halime.
-Suleyman Shah awaits you in his tent.

1:22:19.966 --> 1:22:21.300
Hurry up.

1:22:25.999 --> 1:22:27.700
-Halime.
-Be quick.

1:22:38.766 --> 1:22:41.066
Numan Efendi, what happened?

1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:44.800
Do not worry, Afsin. There is no problem.

1:22:49.533 --> 1:22:50.533
Father?

1:22:52.300 --> 1:22:53.300
Father?

1:22:56.866 --> 1:22:59.666
Halime Baci, where are they taking
my Shahzade?

1:23:01.499 --> 1:23:03.433
Suleyman Shah wanted to see him.

1:23:20.900 --> 1:23:24.733
I knew it would end up like this.
I knew they would be trouble.

1:23:26.066 --> 1:23:28.400
If something happens to Gundogdu...

1:23:28.566 --> 1:23:32.700
...I would kill that girl and her family.
-Stop right there, girl, stop!

1:23:33.766 --> 1:23:37.000
Wife of a Bey needs to be resilient.
Control yourself!

1:23:52.533 --> 1:23:55.333
Here I am, Bey. You called for me.

1:23:59.333 --> 1:24:00.600
Come this way.

1:24:10.666 --> 1:24:12.533
A messenger arrived this morning.

1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:16.900
He told us that our caravan was ambushed
and our Alps were killed.

1:24:18.366 --> 1:24:21.666
Karatoygar, who did this,
has my son Gundogdu as a prisoner.

1:24:23.766 --> 1:24:24.966
Bey...

1:24:26.033 --> 1:24:30.066
...I don’t know what a test like this
is called. May God give you patience.

1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:39.500
I did not call you here to say prayers or
share our sorrow. As I called you here...

1:24:40.333 --> 1:24:44.100
...you probably realized what those
bandits who hold my son hostage want.

1:24:44.900 --> 1:24:47.533
Now, I am going to ask you one question.

1:24:47.933 --> 1:24:50.533
And I request a single answer from you.

1:24:54.033 --> 1:24:55.400
Who are you?

1:24:56.100 --> 1:25:00.100
On one side, my husband and on the other,
the people we don’t know anything about.

1:25:00.366 --> 1:25:03.500
They killed so many Alps,
they took Gundogdu prisoner!

1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:08.300
And I am telling you,
they are hiding something from us...

1:25:08.500 --> 1:25:12.000
...but I will learn what that is
then they will pay for all of this!

1:25:12.300 --> 1:25:15.666
Mountains hold the ground,
Beys hold the customs, my girl.

1:25:16.533 --> 1:25:18.966
All the things you say is men’s job!

1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:25.433
Because of their curse,
is there a man left in the tribe, mother?

1:25:27.866 --> 1:25:30.800
Go after her,
don’t let her make the matters worse.

1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:39.800
Bey, telling you this is my debt but...

1:25:41.533 --> 1:25:43.466
...please know that...

1:25:45.433 --> 1:25:50.033
...not sharing this with you is as much
about your safety as well as my own...

1:25:50.366 --> 1:25:52.400
...and my family’s safety.

1:25:53.900 --> 1:25:59.600
Bey, if I tell you who we are,
the disasters you will face...

1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:04.533
...will be many times worse than now.

1:26:05.866 --> 1:26:07.366
But...

1:26:11.966 --> 1:26:13.733
...I owe you a life.

1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:18.866
I am ready to sacrifice anything for you.

1:26:20.033 --> 1:26:23.933
This includes my life
and my children’s as well.

1:26:24.466 --> 1:26:27.033
I told you to give a single answer.
Only one!

1:26:32.500 --> 1:26:33.666
I am...

1:26:35.933 --> 1:26:38.700
...from the Great Seljuk Dynasty...

1:26:39.066 --> 1:26:41.000
...Muzaffereddin Davut.

1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:43.833
Muhiddin Mesut Shah’s son.

1:26:45.333 --> 1:26:49.500
I am the grandson of
Sultan Izzeddin Kilicarslan.

1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:52.933
I am a Seljuk Shahzade.

1:27:08.366 --> 1:27:09.466
Halime!

1:27:10.533 --> 1:27:11.800
Hear me well!

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.533
You will curse the day you came here.

1:27:14.933 --> 1:27:19.000
For all the things you made this tribe
go through, you will be accounted for.

1:27:19.433 --> 1:27:22.566
Do you understand me?
If it comes down to me...

1:27:22.766 --> 1:27:26.100
...I would not hesitate to kill you all!
I will kill you!

1:27:27.533 --> 1:27:30.700
Calm down, Hatun.
Why do you attack like a rabid dog?

1:27:31.466 --> 1:27:35.700
Because of you, our caravan is raided,
our Alps are killed...

1:27:36.100 --> 1:27:39.700
...that filth called Karatoygar
holds my husband hostage!

1:27:39.900 --> 1:27:44.300
If one hair on his head is harmed,
if I have to live through that pain...

1:27:44.466 --> 1:27:47.533
...you will see what
a rabid dog looks like then!

1:27:47.633 --> 1:27:49.700
Sister. That is enough.

1:27:50.100 --> 1:27:51.633
Let us go.

1:27:51.966 --> 1:27:54.833
We will not go, Gokce. They will.

1:27:55.733 --> 1:27:57.066
Dead or alive.

1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:10.033
-They will go!
-Selcan!

1:28:12.466 --> 1:28:13.733
Control yourself.

1:28:13.833 --> 1:28:15.066
Take her out.

1:28:28.366 --> 1:28:34.600
Whatever you heard from by bride
a while ago, don’t tell anyone about it.

1:28:39.666 --> 1:28:45.500
Stay in the tent. Because none of us know
what will happen now.

1:29:09.966 --> 1:29:12.033
Do we have permission, Halime Baci?

1:29:17.733 --> 1:29:19.033
I heard it all.

1:29:23.066 --> 1:29:24.700
This is not good at all.

1:29:24.833 --> 1:29:26.500
What will we do, Afsin Bey?

1:29:26.766 --> 1:29:30.366
The bride threatened to kill us
if something happens to her husband.

1:29:30.833 --> 1:29:32.633
We will find a solution.

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:37.633
It seems that Suleyman Shah will not
announce the dead Alps.

1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:43.433
If the news gets around, no one would know
what the people might do.

1:29:43.566 --> 1:29:47.900
God forbid. We don’t want any harm
on our Shahzades or Gundogdu.

1:29:48.933 --> 1:29:50.766
Karatoygar’s aim is obvious.

1:29:52.533 --> 1:29:54.466
In exchange for Gundogdu...

1:29:56.966 --> 1:29:58.900
...he will request our Shahzades.

1:30:03.666 --> 1:30:06.900
Don’t go out from the tent.
I will do whatever is needed.

1:30:07.066 --> 1:30:08.500
With your permission.

1:30:26.433 --> 1:30:31.566
We have grown tired of running for years.
I ran away from those who...

1:30:31.766 --> 1:30:34.066
...threatened my state with me.

1:30:35.400 --> 1:30:40.366
From the Templars, the Mongols. I ran away
from all those who want an uprising.

1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:46.633
I ran away from those who pursue me
for the survival of my state.

1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:52.633
And I ran away from my state so that
my valiant son would not be harmed.

1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:56.466
Bey...

1:30:56.666 --> 1:30:59.900
...it has been years since
I have given up on my own life.

1:31:00.033 --> 1:31:03.800
So this is the end,
it is time to put an end to all this.

1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:09.900
Karatoygar wants an exchange, father.

1:31:10.533 --> 1:31:12.833
But even if we give him what he wants...

1:31:13.100 --> 1:31:14.600
...he would kill you.

1:31:15.366 --> 1:31:18.500
His rage against you will not subside
after he gets the Shahzades.

1:31:18.666 --> 1:31:20.866
He will kill you and my brother as well.

1:31:21.533 --> 1:31:23.100
You are right, my son.

1:31:24.866 --> 1:31:26.100
First...

1:31:26.366 --> 1:31:29.000
...we have to find a way
to save Gundogdu from him.

1:31:29.400 --> 1:31:32.900
Not only my brother.
I would not hand you over to him, father.

1:31:34.933 --> 1:31:38.733
If I attack with my Alps,
he would kill Gundogdu immediately.

1:31:39.900 --> 1:31:44.366
And with the blood that would be spilt,
the tribe cannot stand strong again.

1:31:44.700 --> 1:31:46.100
We would fall apart.

1:31:46.733 --> 1:31:50.033
First you have to convince him
to free my brother, father.

1:31:50.400 --> 1:31:52.833
Then convince him to come out of his fort.

1:31:53.066 --> 1:31:56.033
If he wants an exchange, we set the rules.

1:31:56.366 --> 1:31:59.333
-Why would he free Gundogdu?
-He has to, father.

1:32:00.533 --> 1:32:03.366
Why did the Templars
try to kill me in Aleppo?

1:32:03.566 --> 1:32:06.700
Why did they send a leper woman
to poison the tribe?

1:32:07.666 --> 1:32:11.100
Why were the Templars were taking
the Shahzades to Karatoygar?

1:32:11.400 --> 1:32:16.033
They wanted Karatoygar to be appointed
to an important post in the palace...

1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:18.733
...and for him to serve them
at the palace.

1:32:18.866 --> 1:32:23.066
Karatoygar is after the Shahzades, father.
He would do everything to get them...

1:32:23.400 --> 1:32:25.766
...we just need to know how to ask for it.

1:32:28.533 --> 1:32:30.466
What if something goes wrong?

1:32:35.366 --> 1:32:37.333
Then we all die, father.

1:32:38.366 --> 1:32:42.933
But at least we would die holding a sword
in our hands and honor in our hearts.

1:32:42.934 --> 0:02:03.574


1:33:04.466 --> 1:33:05.633
Will they die?

1:33:09.433 --> 1:33:11.466
Unfortunately it has to be that way.

1:33:12.633 --> 1:33:14.766
They will all die, except Gundogdu.

1:33:16.200 --> 1:33:22.266
Maybe a lucky Alp will live to bring
the bad news to Suleyman Shah.

1:33:23.633 --> 1:33:27.533
I don’t believe it.
The reign of Suleyman Shah will be over.

1:33:28.833 --> 1:33:32.466
What a big bad world. Incredible.

1:33:33.500 --> 1:33:35.866
What if he insists on customs...

1:33:36.533 --> 1:33:38.300
...and not hand over the prisoners?

1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:41.766
What else can he do?
Will he accept the death of his own son?

1:33:41.966 --> 1:33:45.400
What will we do if he rounds up
his Alps and attack Karatoygar?

1:33:45.566 --> 1:33:49.466
I know Suleyman Shah very well,
he would put his own life at stake.

1:33:50.900 --> 1:33:53.933
Karatoygar will kill both of them.

1:33:56.366 --> 1:33:58.400
Then only Ertugrul will be left.

1:33:58.833 --> 1:34:02.700
-And his death...
-You have gone too far, Bey. Too far.

1:34:03.333 --> 1:34:05.233
No good would come out of this.

1:34:05.566 --> 1:34:09.633
You dog! If you were so scared,
why did you team up with me?

1:34:10.333 --> 1:34:12.433
For the good of the tribe, Bey.

1:34:12.533 --> 1:34:15.900
-I didn’t expect it to be...
-What didn’t you expect? What?

1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:21.233
If a few Alps need to be sacrificed
for the good of the tribe, let them be.

1:34:21.333 --> 1:34:23.600
Isn’t it so? Tell me, isn’t it so?

1:34:24.266 --> 1:34:27.433
You are right, Bey.
They can be sacrificed.

1:34:35.866 --> 1:34:37.866
May God forgive all their sins.

1:34:38.733 --> 1:34:40.700
We did what needed to be done.

1:34:41.733 --> 1:34:45.333
If I didn’t convince Karatoygar
to ambush the caravan...

1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:50.866
...he'd have run over us with his army.
Our progeny would have ended.

1:34:51.200 --> 1:34:57.000
Now I we need to do is to sit back and
wait for the bad news to reach the tribe.

1:35:00.200 --> 1:35:02.966
You go and wash your face,
you need to freshen up.

1:35:17.566 --> 1:35:19.633
Watch out for this coward, Alpargu.

1:35:19.833 --> 1:35:22.700
If his cowardice lets his tongue loose...

1:35:22.833 --> 1:35:24.966
...don’t be afraid to rip it off.

1:35:30.333 --> 1:35:32.533
Everything will be alright, you will see.

1:35:33.233 --> 1:35:35.633
Suleyman Shah would not sacrifice his son.

1:35:36.466 --> 1:35:39.666
He would not sacrifice him, right?
Of course not.

1:35:39.833 --> 1:35:42.700
But he would not step back
from our customs either.

1:35:43.700 --> 1:35:45.000
Sister...

1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:48.900
...please do not over think
the situation and devastate yourself.

1:35:49.266 --> 1:35:53.500
What if he does something crazy, like
trying to save Gundogdu from Karatoygar?

1:35:53.666 --> 1:35:55.700
This is what I am worried about.

1:35:57.433 --> 1:35:59.700
I will go and talk with Suleyman Shah.

1:36:06.900 --> 1:36:09.000
First he will free Gundogdu.

1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:13.966
Then I will take Karatoygar outside
his fort to the place we determined.

1:36:14.833 --> 1:36:20.000
When we reach there, the rest will be
up to your courage and skill, son.

1:36:25.466 --> 1:36:28.633
-An important matter is being discussed.
-Get out of my way.

1:36:29.933 --> 1:36:33.366
-Our Bey’s orders.
-I told you to get out of my way.

1:36:34.866 --> 1:36:37.666
We will ambush Karatoygar
at Kartal Tepesi.

1:36:53.700 --> 1:36:55.266
Let us talk outside.

1:37:13.400 --> 1:37:16.733
I promise that I will deliver my brother
Gundogdu to you safe and sound.

1:37:16.866 --> 1:37:18.966
If something happens to Gundogdu...

1:37:19.333 --> 1:37:22.800
...if you sacrifice your brother
for people you collected on the road...

1:37:22.966 --> 1:37:25.633
...you shall never find
peace from me, Ertugrul.

1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:27.300
Bey...

1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:29.400
...as a father...

1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:32.433
...I will request one last thing from you.

1:37:32.633 --> 1:37:36.466
If you give permission,
I want to entrust my daughter to you.

1:37:39.633 --> 1:37:45.333
Karatoygar is after my son and I.
They have no business with my daughter.

1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:49.433
My daughter is the tribe’s girl
from now on.

1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:56.300
She has no one to turn to
or anywhere to go.

1:38:02.933 --> 1:38:04.933
Please be rest assured, Yenge.

1:38:24.633 --> 1:38:26.400
Stop! What do you want?

1:38:31.533 --> 1:38:33.466
I wanted to ask about a sergeant.

1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.733
He used to be a sergeant in my legion.

1:38:35.833 --> 1:38:38.933
-What is his name?
-Sari, they call him Sari Bolu.

1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.233
Of course we know Sari Bolu.

1:38:47.433 --> 1:38:50.366
But he is not a sergeant
but a captain now.

1:38:52.766 --> 1:38:54.300
Is he in the base?

1:38:54.566 --> 1:38:58.266
He went on a mission with Karatoygar.
If you have a message, tell it to us.

1:38:58.366 --> 1:38:59.966
I do, warrior, I do.

1:40:17.266 --> 1:40:18.866
Welcome, Titus.

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:23.500
Have a seat.

1:40:29.633 --> 1:40:33.200
I read the letter Ustad-i Azam
sent with a pigeon.

1:40:33.866 --> 1:40:36.900
He does not want Kayis
to migrate to Aleppo.

1:40:37.866 --> 1:40:39.300
Yes.

1:40:39.933 --> 1:40:41.666
He should not worry.

1:40:42.700 --> 1:40:45.433
Kayis will not migrate to Aleppo...

1:40:45.700 --> 1:40:48.366
...but to a place
I find suitable for them.

1:40:48.766 --> 1:40:50.000
How?

1:40:50.466 --> 1:40:54.466
Their future Bey thinks just like me.

1:40:55.566 --> 1:40:59.500
He prefers to kneel in front of
the Mongols rather than...

1:40:59.700 --> 1:41:02.900
...to be neighbors with the Crusaders.

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:05.500
Who is this man?

1:41:06.333 --> 1:41:07.566
Kurdoglu.

1:41:07.933 --> 1:41:10.733
Suleyman Shah’s blood brother.

1:41:12.933 --> 1:41:14.933
An ambitious fool.

1:41:16.833 --> 1:41:22.300
Someone who will do anything we say,
someone we can use as we wish.

1:41:23.833 --> 1:41:25.466
What about Suleyman Shah?

1:41:26.633 --> 1:41:28.466
Suleyman Shah...

1:41:30.766 --> 1:41:34.833
...will come to my fort in the evening...

1:41:35.600 --> 1:41:37.200
...and surrender.

1:41:38.433 --> 1:41:42.566
Moreover, he will bring with him
the Shahzades...

1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:45.900
...your knights let escape.

1:42:10.533 --> 1:42:11.866
Afsin Bey!

1:42:27.966 --> 1:42:29.733
I thought you were dead.

1:42:29.966 --> 1:42:32.266
It had to be known like that, Bolu.

1:42:33.366 --> 1:42:35.500
Our state is under a big threat.

1:42:36.266 --> 1:42:37.733
I need your help.

1:43:16.666 --> 1:43:18.733
Why is this ominous news late?

1:43:26.766 --> 1:43:29.633
Bey, Suleyman Shah calls you to his tent.

1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:47.800
Whatever happens,
Karatoygar should not get the Shahzades.

1:43:49.700 --> 1:43:53.333
What if he succeeds in taking
the Shahzades to Sultan Aladdin?

1:43:53.900 --> 1:43:57.666
He would be Aladdin’s favorite commander.

1:43:58.833 --> 1:44:01.500
Templars would have Konya in their hands.

1:44:02.200 --> 1:44:05.900
They would roam within the palace.
The consequences would be deadly, Sari.

1:44:06.466 --> 1:44:09.000
This state was founded
with great difficulty.

1:44:10.300 --> 1:44:14.233
We will not refrain from killing
the Shahzades if needed.

1:44:18.633 --> 1:44:21.333
I am ready to do anything
you want from me, Bey.

1:44:22.500 --> 1:44:24.766
Thank you, I know that, Sari, I know.

1:44:27.366 --> 1:44:29.500
What a tyrant this Karatoygar is!

1:44:31.700 --> 1:44:35.433
How could he dare to kill our warriors?
As if that is not enough...

1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:38.333
...he captured Gundogdu as a prisoner?
-Yes.

1:44:39.533 --> 1:44:42.333
Now, they expect me to deliver our guests.

1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:46.233
That means that the death of
this rabid dog will be from us.

1:44:46.566 --> 1:44:49.966
Let us go with our Alps and
make the sky fall on them.

1:44:50.466 --> 1:44:51.733
No!

1:44:52.666 --> 1:44:54.366
I will go alone.

1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.833
I won’t let you go alone.

1:44:57.300 --> 1:45:01.933
Did we become blood brothers for one to
stay behind and cry like women...

1:45:02.233 --> 1:45:06.433
...while the other one
is going for a certain death, Bey?

1:45:07.466 --> 1:45:10.833
The path I will be on
is full of unknowns, Kurdoglu.

1:45:11.233 --> 1:45:16.266
How can I go on this road if
my blood brother is not staying behind...

1:45:16.400 --> 1:45:20.500
...to protect and serve my tribe
in case something happens to me?

1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:36.200
You shall be taking
my place until I return.

1:45:48.666 --> 1:45:50.233
Put this on as well.

1:45:51.566 --> 1:45:53.333
Do not feel cold on the road.

1:45:57.833 --> 1:45:59.733
-Sister...
-Say it, my lion.

1:46:00.966 --> 1:46:03.266
What if I can’t see you again?

1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:05.466
What are you saying, Yigit?

1:46:05.700 --> 1:46:09.900
We survived so many difficulties together.
We passed so many obstacles.

1:46:10.766 --> 1:46:12.833
We will pass this one as well.

1:46:14.700 --> 1:46:18.200
But this time we are separated.
You will not be with us.

1:46:18.433 --> 1:46:23.000
-What if those men take us and...
-Do not worry your pure heart like this.

1:46:23.900 --> 1:46:27.433
Look, this time we are not alone.
There are Beys of the tribe.

1:46:27.566 --> 1:46:30.233
They will protect us, they care for us.

1:46:30.833 --> 1:46:34.866
Always stay beside my father.
Do everything he says, alright?

1:46:35.600 --> 1:46:39.500
And do not think about me.
I will sit here and wait for you.

1:46:39.933 --> 1:46:42.233
There will be no sadness, do we agree?

1:46:46.400 --> 1:46:47.566
Come on.

1:46:47.733 --> 1:46:49.233
Now go...

1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:53.366
...and say goodbye to your friends. Go on.

1:47:06.500 --> 1:47:07.866
Father.

1:47:13.933 --> 1:47:18.300
I am just talking so that
Yigit is not scared or gets sad but...

1:47:19.666 --> 1:47:24.466
...my mind does not believe my own words.
How will it end?

1:47:25.666 --> 1:47:30.266
My girl, it has been a very long time.

1:47:31.266 --> 1:47:35.533
We went through many sorrows
by running away and getting captured.

1:47:35.933 --> 1:47:39.200
This thing will finish once and for all,
if God permits.

1:47:40.366 --> 1:47:43.466
Ertugrul has a plan.
I found it probable as well.

1:47:44.233 --> 1:47:48.433
With God’s permission,
we shall go and come back in one piece.

1:47:49.433 --> 1:47:52.000
This tribe paid a very big price for us.

1:47:52.866 --> 1:47:55.600
We can never repay them for all they did.

1:47:56.500 --> 1:47:59.833
Please let me.
Let me come with you as well.

1:48:01.933 --> 1:48:04.666
Whatever happens, good or bad...

1:48:05.500 --> 1:48:07.700
...we should be together at the end.

1:48:09.266 --> 1:48:12.700
You pray for us, that is enough, my girl.

1:48:13.766 --> 1:48:18.733
My precious and brave daughter with
a beautiful heart and a beautiful face.

1:48:19.900 --> 1:48:25.833
Just like her mother, self sacrificing
and loyal. My beautiful daughter.

1:48:28.233 --> 1:48:29.666
Do not worry.

1:48:31.333 --> 1:48:33.466
Everything will be fine.

1:48:53.200 --> 1:48:54.933
What happened? What do you want?

1:48:55.400 --> 1:48:56.600
Come with us.

1:49:23.766 --> 1:49:27.266
This boil is hurting
like a knife in my back.

1:49:27.633 --> 1:49:29.266
My Bey...

1:49:29.733 --> 1:49:33.500
...your pain is my pain.
But there is nothing I can do.

1:49:34.233 --> 1:49:37.633
All I can do is to pray
for you and my sons.

1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:42.666
We went through so many sorrows,
so many journeys, so many battles.

1:49:43.633 --> 1:49:49.766
We had the privilege to grow old.
Thank God, we have seen these days, Hayme.

1:49:50.366 --> 1:49:55.500
You are right, Bey.
We saw so many weddings, so many babies...

1:49:55.866 --> 1:49:59.533
...so many springs.
We saw so many victories.

1:50:00.400 --> 1:50:03.233
If God permits, we will continue
to see more.

1:50:05.700 --> 1:50:07.333
I want your blessing.

1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:13.566
These problems are not permanent
and our lives are not eternal, Bey.

1:50:13.833 --> 1:50:18.366
You always walked on the righteous path.
You never bowed to tyrants.

1:50:18.633 --> 1:50:22.366
Has anyone seen a person
on the righteous path getting lost?

1:50:23.300 --> 1:50:27.966
If God permits,
I will see you and my sons’ return.

1:50:30.633 --> 1:50:32.566
May God be with you.

1:50:33.466 --> 1:50:35.400
My blessing is with you.

1:50:37.566 --> 1:50:38.800
Thank you.

1:50:55.566 --> 1:50:57.433
What is it? What do you want?

1:51:01.366 --> 1:51:03.966
Where do you go,
where do you come from, Afsin Bey?

1:51:04.500 --> 1:51:07.466
I want to hear what you are made of
from your mouth.

1:52:23.366 --> 1:52:28.200
Dear God, please protect them, Dear God.

1:52:41.300 --> 1:52:43.266
You called for me, mother.

1:52:44.366 --> 1:52:47.233
I did. Come and sit down.

1:52:55.366 --> 1:52:56.600
Yes, mother?

1:53:00.366 --> 1:53:01.766
Ertugrul Bey?

1:53:03.966 --> 1:53:05.666
Do we have permission?

1:53:13.366 --> 1:53:17.266
Halime Sultan comes to our tent,
does she need a permission?

1:53:31.333 --> 1:53:32.833
Ertugrul Bey...

1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:36.433
...I lied to you.

1:53:39.900 --> 1:53:41.466
Yes, you did.

1:53:43.500 --> 1:53:46.366
Do you understand now, why we had to go?

1:53:47.266 --> 1:53:52.233
Why the days we spent in this tribe are
only a dream that we would wake from?

1:53:52.333 --> 1:53:53.966
You are happy here.

1:53:54.766 --> 1:53:57.500
Despite a life you lived in a palace...

1:53:57.700 --> 1:54:00.866
...you talk about a nomad life
like a dream, Halime.

1:54:01.566 --> 1:54:04.200
Even if the whole world comes together...

1:54:04.333 --> 1:54:06.533
...I will not let you become unhappy.

1:54:11.233 --> 1:54:13.233
Do you understand me, my girl?

1:54:15.933 --> 1:54:17.333
I did, mother.

1:54:18.966 --> 1:54:20.000
Good.

1:54:20.733 --> 1:54:22.000
You may go now.

1:54:22.966 --> 1:54:26.566
Instead of reacting and
spewing out bitter words...

1:54:26.733 --> 1:54:32.600
...recite God’s name, pray
and fill your heart with goodness...

1:54:33.466 --> 1:54:35.500
...so that our fate be good as well.

1:54:53.666 --> 1:54:55.700
The problem is not my happiness.

1:54:58.233 --> 1:55:00.800
The problem is my father’s
and my brother’s life.

1:55:07.966 --> 1:55:09.500
Do not worry.

1:55:11.333 --> 1:55:14.533
I will not let anything happen
to your father or your brother.

1:55:15.333 --> 1:55:17.766
I will bring them back to you
safe and sound.

1:55:18.766 --> 1:55:20.466
You can be rest assured.

1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:30.466
After all the things that have been
robbed and taken away from me...

1:55:30.566 --> 1:55:33.500
...you are taking with you
all that is left.

1:55:34.766 --> 1:55:37.766
My father, my brother.

1:55:40.833 --> 1:55:43.000
I beg you to return with them.

1:55:47.500 --> 1:55:50.566
Return and complete
the thing that is missing inside me.

1:56:13.700 --> 1:56:15.966
If I do not return, know that...

1:56:17.566 --> 1:56:20.566
...whatever I had missing inside me,
I found it in you.

1:56:32.366 --> 1:56:34.300
Their intention is not good, Gokce...

1:56:34.433 --> 1:56:36.766
...they will let my man die
in the name of customs.

1:56:37.233 --> 1:56:39.933
Sister, Suleyman Shah
is a human being as well.

1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:44.366
Would a human let his child be slain?
Get rid of these delusions from your mind.

1:56:44.500 --> 1:56:48.500
You do not know who Suleyman Shah is.
He would even burn his tribe for customs.

1:56:48.700 --> 1:56:51.000
I have to find a way, Gokce, I have to.

1:56:55.800 --> 1:56:58.300
I will not let them sacrifice my man!

1:57:00.733 --> 1:57:01.933
Dear God!

1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:14.600
Ertugrul’s Alps have prepared
their horses and weapons, waiting to go.

1:57:29.366 --> 1:57:31.500
I have things to say to you, Kurdoglu.

1:57:31.733 --> 1:57:33.533
What happened, Selcan Hatun?

1:57:34.366 --> 1:57:37.600
Gundogdu trusts you, he respects you.
You know that.

1:57:39.466 --> 1:57:41.200
What about you, Selcan Hatun?

1:57:41.633 --> 1:57:44.566
-I have always trusted your bravery.
-Thank you.

1:57:45.833 --> 1:57:49.633
What happened to Gundogdu is not
acceptable. But do not worry...

1:57:50.533 --> 1:57:53.800
...Suleyman Shah will bring him back.
-No he will not.

1:57:54.966 --> 1:57:58.633
If you are brave, if you do not want
Suleyman Shah to throw...

1:57:58.766 --> 1:58:03.533
...his tribe into fire,
if you respect Gundogdu a little bit...

1:58:03.666 --> 1:58:06.233
If Suleyman Shah
does something like this...

1:58:06.500 --> 1:58:09.000
...I would throw him into the fire myself.

1:58:10.766 --> 1:58:13.300
Now I am listening to you, Selcan Hatun.

1:58:13.633 --> 1:58:16.966
Suleyman Shah and Ertugrul...

1:58:17.933 --> 1:58:20.933
...will ambush
Karatoygar at Kartal Tepesi.

1:58:24.466 --> 1:58:27.900
-What are you saying, Selcan Hatun?
-I heard it with my own ears.

1:58:28.200 --> 1:58:32.633
Suleyman Shah decided to be loyal
to his customs rather than his son!

1:58:34.866 --> 1:58:39.333
Do not tell this to anyone, Selcan Hatun.
And you did not talk with me...

1:58:39.466 --> 1:58:42.266
...we did not see each other.
Alright, Selcan Hatun?

1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:44.300
What will happen to Gundogdu?

1:58:44.833 --> 1:58:46.733
We will find a solution.

1:58:47.600 --> 1:58:50.233
Go on, get out before anyone sees you.

1:59:18.666 --> 1:59:20.433
Will we let them go, Bey?

1:59:20.733 --> 1:59:24.433
We will, so that Karatoygar’s hunt
can be more fruitful, Alpargu.

1:59:24.566 --> 1:59:27.533
I cleaned the tribe from all filth
without drawing a sword...

1:59:27.666 --> 1:59:29.766
...or getting blood on my hands.

1:59:30.933 --> 1:59:35.266
Come on, get on your horse.
You have things to say to Karatoygar.

1:59:44.300 --> 1:59:47.333
<i>I swear on the horses</i>
 <i>that run endlessly...</i>

1:59:49.000 --> 1:59:52.466
<i>I swear on the horseshoes that sparkle...</i>

1:59:53.233 --> 1:59:59.266
<i>If I am scared to die for our tribe,</i>
 <i>for our Bey, for our customs...</i>

1:59:59.833 --> 2:00:04.233
<i>...may I be slain by my own steel sword,</i>
 <i>like a crop in the field.</i>

2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:09.800
<i>May the blue sky tear,</i>
 <i>may the brave ground sink...</i>

2:00:10.533 --> 2:00:13.533
<i>...may my name be erased</i>
 <i>from all monuments.</i>

2:00:14.833 --> 2:00:20.266
<i>May my forefather Oguz,</i>
 <i>my blessed tribe sue me in the next life!</i>

2:00:21.733 --> 2:00:25.466
<i>In this path I have taken,</i>
 <i>may God be by my side...</i>

2:00:25.633 --> 2:00:27.733
<i>...may Godsend Hıdr accompany me.</i>

2:01:02.333 --> 2:01:04.566
Come on, Titus. Relax a bit.

2:01:05.400 --> 2:01:06.900
Today is our day.

2:01:07.866 --> 2:01:09.900
We will both get what we want.

2:01:10.833 --> 2:01:14.366
You were this comfortable
when Ertugrul was going to Aleppo as well.

2:01:14.566 --> 2:01:17.733
You were this relaxed.
Then we know what happened.

2:01:18.633 --> 2:01:20.533
Your soldiers’ incompetence.

2:01:33.833 --> 2:01:35.733
Sir, Suleyman Shah.

2:01:38.366 --> 2:01:42.966
Let us not make our visitors wait.
Let them in.

2:01:43.700 --> 2:01:45.000
He came alone, sir.

2:01:50.266 --> 2:01:52.300
Bring him here immediately.

2:02:01.233 --> 2:02:05.400
Let us see whether you will eat what you
hope or what you find, Karatoygar.

2:02:36.533 --> 2:02:40.733
You, what are you up to, Suleyman Shah?
Where are they?

2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:44.466
You will get what you want
after you release my son.

2:02:45.933 --> 2:02:48.300
Do you want to be killed?

2:02:50.233 --> 2:02:54.300
Is my son’s and my life more valuable
or the Shahzades?

0:10:30.500 --> 0:10:32.500
