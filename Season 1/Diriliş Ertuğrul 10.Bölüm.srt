episode 10 will start after 12:5 Minute

0:11:58.839 --> 0:12:03.339
{\an8}RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

0:12:03.574 --> 0:12:07.307
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

0:12:07.909 --> 0:12:10.975
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION.

0:12:12.900 --> 0:12:15.400
{\an8}KAYI TRIBE

0:12:34.500 --> 0:12:36.166
This is all, Mother Hayme.

0:12:36.333 --> 0:12:39.966
Thank you for your efforts.
Go and rest now, we will manage the rest.

0:12:41.133 --> 0:12:42.266
Fatma.

0:12:48.966 --> 0:12:51.400
If we could sell these
in the Aleppo market.

0:12:53.133 --> 0:12:55.600
The market in Aleppo is
a death market, mother.

0:12:55.933 --> 0:12:58.800
While there is so much turmoil,
is that even possible?

0:12:59.100 --> 0:13:03.833
Ertugrul will set everything right.
He has overcome so many things.

0:13:05.233 --> 0:13:08.800
They say that he barely escaped
the hangman's noose of the Ameer.

0:13:10.100 --> 0:13:12.233
What problem can he set right?

0:13:18.200 --> 0:13:20.833
Let him return to his tribe
safe and sound first.

0:13:24.066 --> 0:13:25.200
Gokce.

0:13:28.033 --> 0:13:29.200
Yes, Mother Hayme?

0:13:30.200 --> 0:13:33.800
-Can you tell Aykiz to come and see me?
-Yes, of course.

0:14:12.000 --> 0:14:15.533
Your work and efforts
of one long year lies here.

0:14:16.533 --> 0:14:18.800
I would not let them go to waste.

0:14:22.266 --> 0:14:23.833
Tomorrow is Friday.

0:14:24.533 --> 0:14:27.133
May it be a blessed day, if God permits.

0:14:27.600 --> 0:14:29.333
Do not think evil.

0:14:30.100 --> 0:14:31.366
Understood?

0:14:32.200 --> 0:14:33.933
Do not think...

0:14:34.066 --> 0:14:36.066
...so that our men can trust us.

0:14:37.033 --> 0:14:39.800
Come on now, we have a lot of work to do.
Come on.

0:15:08.566 --> 0:15:10.966
I was looking for you everywhere, Aykiz.

0:15:11.966 --> 0:15:13.966
Mother Hayme would like to see you.

0:15:18.300 --> 0:15:21.066
Aykiz, that is enough,
pull yourself together.

0:15:21.566 --> 0:15:23.933
Tell me how to do it as well. Go on.

0:15:25.533 --> 0:15:28.433
We both know what Ertugrul
is after in Aleppo...

0:15:28.566 --> 0:15:30.533
...after abandoning Turgut to infidels.

0:15:30.866 --> 0:15:34.266
-How can I pull myself together, Gokce?
-Aykiz, what are you saying?

0:15:34.933 --> 0:15:36.466
What am I saying, Gokce?

0:15:38.600 --> 0:15:41.833
I see that your sister was
right to be angry about Ertugrul.

0:15:43.900 --> 0:15:46.466
She knew where this thing might lead to...

0:15:47.600 --> 0:15:49.166
...but we were blind.

0:15:50.100 --> 0:15:51.400
What thing?

0:15:51.900 --> 0:15:54.200
You know who I am talking about, Gokce.

0:15:56.133 --> 0:15:57.333
Halime.

0:16:15.466 --> 0:16:16.800
Aykiz...

0:16:17.833 --> 0:16:20.166
...are you out of your mind?
What are you doing?

0:16:26.900 --> 0:16:28.066
Look...

0:16:28.333 --> 0:16:30.833
Turgut's, Ertugrul's...

0:16:32.366 --> 0:16:34.966
...and the tribe's fate depends
on this woman.

0:16:51.900 --> 0:16:55.900
The woman is not talking,
Ertugrul is still in a dungeon at Aleppo.

0:16:56.966 --> 0:17:00.866
Father, we should not have left
my brother in that palace all alone.

0:17:02.000 --> 0:17:05.333
What were we going to do, Gundogdu?
Were we going to attack Aleppo?

0:17:05.866 --> 0:17:07.366
The tribe has not settled yet.

0:17:07.533 --> 0:17:10.300
Most of the people are still
on the road, tired and hungry.

0:17:10.433 --> 0:17:12.866
Do the Alps have the strength
to swing a sword?

0:17:13.033 --> 0:17:16.400
Are we going to go against
the big Aleppo army with 2000 braves?

0:17:17.333 --> 0:17:21.366
Ertugrul will succeed in coming out of
the labyrinth he is in, with God's help.

0:17:21.600 --> 0:17:23.000
But...

0:17:23.600 --> 0:17:26.033
...the real problem is what to do next.

0:17:27.200 --> 0:17:30.800
We set on the road as we thought
we would suffer too much in the winter.

0:17:30.966 --> 0:17:34.400
But the land we arrived
is a worse hell than the one before.

0:17:35.033 --> 0:17:37.133
Karatoygar will not give up his pursuit.

0:17:37.300 --> 0:17:40.500
Crusader infidels on one side
and El Aziz on the other.

0:17:41.466 --> 0:17:42.933
May God help us.

0:17:44.200 --> 0:17:46.400
El Aziz cannot go to war without me.

0:17:47.200 --> 0:17:49.800
Neither him or Nasir would dare to.

0:17:51.066 --> 0:17:53.933
They cannot persuade the soldiers
who are loyal to me.

0:17:55.100 --> 0:17:56.400
Vizier...

0:17:57.033 --> 0:17:59.400
...if your soldiers
could show some courage...

0:17:59.466 --> 0:18:01.933
...when you were
kneeling in front of an axe...

0:18:02.400 --> 0:18:04.533
...Ertugrul would be with us now.

0:18:07.033 --> 0:18:11.233
Does the Oghuz tradition include
talking without knowing the facts?

0:18:11.900 --> 0:18:14.800
We are not going to learn
the Oghuz tradition from...

0:18:14.933 --> 0:18:17.366
...the servants of Ayubi palaces, vizier.

0:18:17.966 --> 0:18:22.000
As Ertugrul Bey said,
if the infidels' woman infiltrated...

0:18:22.166 --> 0:18:26.800
...your palace from top to bottom,
you have long lost Aleppo.

0:18:28.600 --> 0:18:30.066
That is enough.

0:18:30.400 --> 0:18:32.533
The situation is known by all.

0:18:33.000 --> 0:18:36.000
What is the use of fighting
each other like jackals?

0:18:37.300 --> 0:18:39.333
We may be attacked any moment.

0:18:40.300 --> 0:18:43.900
Tell Wild Demir to ready
the weapons as soon as possible.

0:18:45.366 --> 0:18:47.800
The tribe shall take warring position.

0:18:49.133 --> 0:18:51.366
We will have
a headquarter meeting tomorrow.

0:18:57.400 --> 0:19:00.566
{\an8}ALEPPO

0:19:01.400 --> 0:19:02.933
Faster!

0:19:13.966 --> 0:19:19.233
No one can stick a knife at my throat
in my palace. You shall die, Turkmen.

0:19:21.133 --> 0:19:25.933
If you were my enemy,
you would have lost your head a long ago.

0:19:27.100 --> 0:19:30.233
Moreover this is not a palace,
it is a Templar's nest.

0:19:30.400 --> 0:19:32.800
Your coffin will come out of this palace.

0:19:32.933 --> 0:19:34.233
Faster!

0:19:49.400 --> 0:19:51.300
Throw down your sword, Turkmen.

0:19:54.233 --> 0:19:57.800
If you even spill a drop of
his highness the Ameer's blood...

0:19:58.033 --> 0:20:01.433
...I swear that you won't see
the daylight once again.

0:20:02.066 --> 0:20:05.233
I am Bey of Kayi,
Suleyman Shah's son Ertugrul.

0:20:07.100 --> 0:20:10.533
Our sword does not spill
the blood of Muslim Aleppo Ameer.

0:20:11.166 --> 0:20:13.933
Take your guards away so
that I can go to my tribe.

0:20:15.000 --> 0:20:16.100
Go on!

0:21:04.000 --> 0:21:05.366
Quick, run!

0:21:13.466 --> 0:21:14.933
It is no use...

0:21:16.000 --> 0:21:17.366
...give up now.

0:21:18.033 --> 0:21:20.333
Only your dead body can leave the palace.

0:21:21.866 --> 0:21:26.300
We die on a horse in moorlands,
let a Kayi die in a palace once.

0:21:31.100 --> 0:21:32.333
Stop right there!

0:21:33.866 --> 0:21:35.100
Stay there!

0:21:56.000 --> 0:21:57.400
Your highness!

0:21:59.166 --> 0:22:00.966
Sir! Your highness!

0:22:02.433 --> 0:22:05.100
Don't stop, catch that Turkmen! Quick!

0:22:07.433 --> 0:22:08.900
Sir, get up!

0:22:10.300 --> 0:22:12.466
Your highness. Wake up!

0:22:17.000 --> 0:22:18.133
Sir?

0:22:19.966 --> 0:22:21.266
Sir, get up.

0:22:22.300 --> 0:22:23.566
Get up.

0:22:27.466 --> 0:22:28.933
You fool.

0:22:48.166 --> 0:22:51.266
Open the door! Open it!
We know that you are inside!

0:22:51.600 --> 0:22:53.066
Open the door!

0:22:55.466 --> 0:22:58.033
He is getting away.
Quick, inform the guards!

0:23:05.066 --> 0:23:06.233
Permission!

0:23:08.100 --> 0:23:09.233
Halime!

0:23:09.800 --> 0:23:11.533
Halime, are you fine, my girl?

0:23:12.200 --> 0:23:13.466
Are you well?

0:23:23.166 --> 0:23:27.800
I apologize for the bother
caused by a goat herder, my Sultan.

0:23:35.433 --> 0:23:36.933
My sister...

0:23:37.566 --> 0:23:41.033
...Leila. My precious sister.

0:23:45.400 --> 0:23:46.866
Piece of my moon.

0:23:56.533 --> 0:23:57.866
Leila!

0:23:59.266 --> 0:24:00.500
Are you alright?

0:24:03.333 --> 0:24:06.066
Save your tyranny to your enemies,
your highness.

0:24:06.233 --> 0:24:10.466
My precious sister has become a toy
in the hand of a Turkmen who turned...

0:24:10.833 --> 0:24:16.066
...turned the corridors of our palace into
bloody ditches and collaborated with...

0:24:16.266 --> 0:24:20.066
...Crusaders and all other infidels
to attack the Muslim world!

0:24:20.500 --> 0:24:23.066
It is a lie! That is far from the truth!

0:24:23.200 --> 0:24:28.433
I understand now. The woman at my traitor
Uncle Sahabettin's execution was...

0:24:28.566 --> 0:24:30.966
...no one but you! I am sure of that.

0:24:31.133 --> 0:24:34.333
You are the only unsure one, right?
My precious sister Leila.

0:24:37.966 --> 0:24:40.100
Your highness, we are guests here.

0:24:41.800 --> 0:24:44.566
But this does not refrain us
from stating the truth.

0:24:45.500 --> 0:24:47.400
Leila Hatun speaks of the truth.

0:24:49.233 --> 0:24:50.866
Then tell me...

0:24:51.300 --> 0:24:52.800
...what is the truth?

0:24:53.400 --> 0:24:57.933
Ertugrul is not an enemy or a traitor
collaborating with the Crusaders.

0:25:00.033 --> 0:25:02.133
He rescued us from the Templars.

0:25:03.333 --> 0:25:04.500
What?

0:25:13.433 --> 0:25:14.900
Leila?

0:25:21.900 --> 0:25:25.166
Leila will never set
her foot out of this room ever again.

0:25:27.266 --> 0:25:28.366
Understood?

0:25:29.066 --> 0:25:30.466
Never again!

0:25:48.833 --> 0:25:50.966
Do you understand me clearly, Nasir?

0:25:52.433 --> 0:25:54.966
If you ever fail again...

0:25:56.200 --> 0:25:59.100
...I will kill and
hang your body on El Aziz's balcony.

0:26:00.400 --> 0:26:02.566
I would do this. I swear!

0:26:03.800 --> 0:26:06.866
How do you know that
Eftelya is in the tribe?

0:26:13.133 --> 0:26:15.966
They know that they cannot
even breathe in Aleppo.

0:26:17.033 --> 0:26:18.966
The tribe is their only refuge.

0:26:20.266 --> 0:26:25.433
If Eftelya talks, Aleppo would fall.
We can never allow that.

0:26:28.000 --> 0:26:30.300
Send one of your best man to the tribe.

0:26:33.400 --> 0:26:35.000
Eftelya must die.

0:26:59.000 --> 0:27:00.600
-I am going, Dogan.
-Bamsi.

0:27:02.166 --> 0:27:04.033
How much longer are we going to sit?

0:27:04.166 --> 0:27:06.600
Are we going to sit and get fat like
a breeding stock?

0:27:06.900 --> 0:27:10.066
You mountain bear, what did our Bey say?
Didn't he tell us to wait?

0:27:10.200 --> 0:27:13.100
Turgut is not with us,
Ertugrul Bey is not with us.

0:27:13.300 --> 0:27:15.466
With what face will we go back
to the tribe?

0:27:15.600 --> 0:27:18.833
How are we going to look
in the eyes of Aykiz and our Bey?

0:27:18.999 --> 0:27:20.900
What will we say to Mother Hayme?

0:27:28.833 --> 0:27:29.999
Bey?

0:27:32.266 --> 0:27:33.433
My brothers.

0:27:35.366 --> 0:27:38.366
Thank you Great God.
We saw our Bey once again.

0:27:43.233 --> 0:27:45.166
Where is that woman called Esma?

0:27:45.499 --> 0:27:49.133
Suleyman Shah sent her to the tribe
with the vizier, just in case.

0:27:52.266 --> 0:27:56.966
We need to make that woman talk
in order to save Turgut and the tribe.

0:28:07.800 --> 0:28:09.333
I missed my own sword.

0:32:39.316 --> 0:32:41.316
Give Suleyman Shah three days.

0:32:42.283 --> 0:32:46.416
If they do not leave our lands
I shall send our armies, your highness.

0:32:46.583 --> 0:32:50.283
I know that my uncle is there as well,
hiding amongst the Kayis.

0:32:50.950 --> 0:32:54.216
Do you think the soldiers would attack
while my uncle is there, Nasir?

0:32:54.383 --> 0:32:56.583
Don't you know how loyal they are to him.

0:32:56.916 --> 0:32:59.583
A finger cut by the sharia law
does not hurt.

0:32:59.916 --> 0:33:02.883
Of course, they will all be punished
for what they did.

0:33:03.050 --> 0:33:05.450
A blood to be spilled
cannot stay in the veins.

0:33:05.550 --> 0:33:07.116
Dear God.

0:33:08.350 --> 0:33:10.116
Help me keep my sanity.

0:33:12.383 --> 0:33:14.416
It is so easy to lose one's mind.

0:33:16.283 --> 0:33:18.950
I never felt so desperate in my life.

0:33:19.850 --> 0:33:23.150
But we have a big opportunity
in our hands, your highness.

0:33:24.883 --> 0:33:27.250
The Seljuk Shahzade and his daughter.

0:33:35.516 --> 0:33:38.416
If you wed with the Shahzade's daughter...

0:33:39.050 --> 0:33:41.216
...no one can stand against your power.

0:33:43.316 --> 0:33:50.283
Then, Seljuk intrusions at our borders and
recklessness of the Templars would end.

0:33:52.583 --> 0:33:55.650
You should take up this opportunity,
your highness.

0:28:18.933 --> 0:28:21.400
{\an8}AMANOS MOUNTAINS TEMPLARS CASTLE

0:28:42.333 --> 0:28:43.933
You were right, sir.

0:28:44.133 --> 0:28:46.366
They managed to infiltrate even here.

0:28:47.266 --> 0:28:48.666
The newcomers.

0:28:50.133 --> 0:28:52.100
I want both of them, Marcus.

0:28:53.066 --> 0:28:54.233
Dead or alive.

0:29:44.940 --> 0:29:46.940


0:34:46.016 --> 0:34:47.183
Leila...

0:34:47.383 --> 0:34:51.850
Governess, you betrayed Leila
whom you raised since she was a baby.

0:34:52.950 --> 0:34:54.716
I did what was right.

0:34:55.183 --> 0:34:56.983
For you and your brother.

0:34:57.250 --> 0:35:01.183
We will all pay for your mistake.
Now, please go away.

0:35:01.816 --> 0:35:03.250
I don't want to see you.

0:35:06.450 --> 0:35:07.450
Permission?

0:35:09.183 --> 0:35:12.883
Shahzade, the Ameer is expecting you.
Your daughter as well.

0:35:59.857 --> 0:36:01.857


0:37:23.833 --> 0:37:26.733
I will put you in a special room
for your safety, Shahzade.

0:37:30.633 --> 0:37:32.933
Who are you protecting us from,
your highness?

0:37:33.233 --> 0:37:35.900
From traitor Templars
and their collaborators.

0:37:36.233 --> 0:37:37.733
What about Ertugrul?

0:37:38.100 --> 0:37:41.200
You witnessed what he did
in my palace as well, Halime Sultan.

0:37:41.333 --> 0:37:43.766
Nothing is as it is seen, your highness.

0:37:46.066 --> 0:37:49.000
Is there anything
you want to talk with me, your highness?

0:37:51.000 --> 0:37:52.700
If you give permission, yes.

0:38:05.866 --> 0:38:07.033
I am listening.

0:38:16.366 --> 0:38:19.000
Against this evil pact...

0:38:19.933 --> 0:38:24.300
...against my emirate and
the whole Muslim world...

0:38:25.700 --> 0:38:27.800
...I plan to start a big war.

0:38:29.066 --> 0:38:32.166
That is why, I request your help.

0:38:33.833 --> 0:38:36.033
I would do all I can, your highness.

0:38:40.966 --> 0:38:44.066
In order to show
our alliance against friends and foe...

0:38:46.333 --> 0:38:48.600
...with your permission, Shahzade...

0:38:50.966 --> 0:38:52.833
...I want to marry your daughter.

0:29:35.800 --> 0:29:37.033
Catch them!

0:30:34.033 --> 0:30:35.366
Catch them!

0:30:57.366 --> 0:31:01.066
Run, Afsin Bey, run. Finish your mission.
Do not leave our Shahzade to them.

0:31:09.800 --> 0:31:11.033
Attack!

0:31:12.933 --> 0:31:14.533
You two, that way!

0:31:14.700 --> 0:31:15.800
You, that way!

0:31:25.300 --> 0:31:26.966
Problem is not only Turgut.

0:31:28.933 --> 0:31:30.000
Nor it is Kayis.

0:31:31.633 --> 0:31:34.500
We fell into a big trap
set for the Muslim world.

0:31:36.000 --> 0:31:39.100
Dying is a duty for all of us.

0:31:44.533 --> 0:31:47.000
It is not right to cry after a martyr.

0:31:47.900 --> 0:31:53.000
If he is living, to go and get Turgut
out of that castle is our duty.

0:31:55.833 --> 0:31:56.966
But...

0:31:58.600 --> 0:32:00.000
...if he is dead...

0:32:02.066 --> 0:32:04.466
...then the duty is to take his revenge.

0:32:05.600 --> 0:32:06.833
Understood?

0:32:07.800 --> 0:32:10.100
-We understand, Bey.
-We understand, Bey.

0:32:17.366 --> 0:32:20.466
Let us go and get benediction
from Ibn Arabi before leaving.

0:32:20.600 --> 0:32:22.366
He left for Jerusalem, Bey.

0:32:23.500 --> 0:32:25.500
He said that he would pray for us.

0:32:29.533 --> 0:32:30.600
Alright.

0:32:31.700 --> 0:32:33.600
Prepare quickly, we shall leave.

0:32:33.625 --> 0:32:35.625


0:35:55.700 --> 0:35:58.900
One of the traitors have been killed,
the other ran away, sir.

0:35:59.200 --> 0:36:01.333
We will catch him as soon as possible.

0:36:02.466 --> 0:36:04.933
Water only spends itself after a storm.

0:36:07.633 --> 0:36:10.900
Marcus, Cardinal Thomas...

0:36:12.366 --> 0:36:14.500
...should not know about this.

0:36:34.633 --> 0:36:35.733
Come this way.

0:36:36.966 --> 0:36:38.500
I am your only hope.

0:36:42.200 --> 0:36:43.366
Quick.

0:36:43.391 --> 0:36:45.391


0:39:49.666 --> 0:39:52.266
Come on, my children, find that traitor!

0:39:52.500 --> 0:39:54.633
Guard all the exits of the castle!

0:39:55.000 --> 0:39:56.433
Bring him to me!

0:40:13.400 --> 0:40:17.400
If someone does a favor to me without
a reason, it means I am in trouble.

0:40:17.600 --> 0:40:21.266
It is not without a reason.
“Do not ask for help from infidels...

0:40:21.400 --> 0:40:24.233
...who have strayed from the path of God”
says our holy book.

0:40:24.366 --> 0:40:26.766
-Then...
-Wasn't Judas an apostle as well?

0:40:27.966 --> 0:40:31.600
It is not known whether betrayal
or salvation comes from friend or foe.

0:40:31.733 --> 0:40:33.333
You tell me then.

0:40:34.800 --> 0:40:38.633
My uncle keeps my father
in a dark dungeon within this castle.

0:40:40.466 --> 0:40:41.600
Why?

0:40:41.766 --> 0:40:43.900
-Because he became a Muslim.
-What?

0:40:55.200 --> 0:40:58.866
Are you telling me that
Ustad's brother is a Muslim now, woman?

0:41:01.566 --> 0:41:03.633
Mohiddin Al Arabi from Andalusia...

0:41:03.966 --> 0:41:05.866
...converted my father into Islam.

0:41:06.700 --> 0:41:09.566
That is why my uncle is keeping him
in the dungeons.

0:41:31.466 --> 0:41:32.833
My dear Isadora.

0:41:39.866 --> 0:41:41.366
Beautiful Isadora.

0:41:42.466 --> 0:41:46.000
Alone and innocent
just like our Virgin Mary.

0:42:00.666 --> 0:42:05.566
I don't think your uncle would object to,
you coming to Constantinople with me.

0:42:06.300 --> 0:42:10.233
My only wish is to complete my prayers
without getting out of this castle.

0:42:12.733 --> 0:42:15.666
Even if the barbarians
are at your borders?

0:42:16.200 --> 0:42:20.533
-Which barbarians?
-Kayis, Isadora. Turks.

0:42:21.233 --> 0:42:22.900
The killers of your father.

0:42:23.566 --> 0:42:26.366
I will wait for you.
It is not a problem for me.

0:43:03.766 --> 0:43:06.800
Please help me.
Save me from this madhouse.

0:43:16.000 --> 0:43:17.533
<i>My Turgut.</i>

0:43:20.233 --> 0:43:23.433
Aykiz. My Aykiz.

0:43:25.766 --> 0:43:27.266
<i>Turgut.</i>

0:43:30.733 --> 0:43:32.366
<i>My Turgut.</i>

0:43:34.966 --> 0:43:36.300
Aykiz.

0:43:37.666 --> 0:43:38.800
My Aykiz.

0:43:49.866 --> 0:43:52.200
Why? Aykiz?

0:43:53.800 --> 0:43:54.866
Aykiz?

0:43:58.700 --> 0:43:59.866
Aykiz!

0:44:00.633 --> 0:44:03.333
Aykiz! Aykiz!

0:44:04.300 --> 0:44:06.333
Aykiz! Aykiz!

0:44:10.733 --> 0:44:13.666
My brave, get a hold of yourself, my lion!

0:44:19.566 --> 0:44:21.333
Are you well, my child?

0:44:22.700 --> 0:44:24.500
Do not let yourself go.

0:44:27.666 --> 0:44:28.966
Be strong.

0:44:37.300 --> 0:44:41.633
A girl came to me.
He asked about an old man in the dungeon.

0:44:43.333 --> 0:44:45.666
His name was Giovanno...

0:44:48.366 --> 0:44:49.566
Giovanna...

0:44:50.200 --> 0:44:51.400
Was it Giovanni?

0:44:54.533 --> 0:44:56.666
Yes! Yes!

0:44:57.266 --> 0:44:59.966
Was the girl's name Isadora?

0:45:00.833 --> 0:45:02.433
Yes, Isadora.

0:45:03.300 --> 0:45:04.566
How do you know her?

0:45:04.766 --> 0:45:08.733
I am Giovanni and she is my daughter.

0:46:02.400 --> 0:46:03.600
May God bless you.

0:46:04.466 --> 0:46:06.633
Do not put God's name on your tongue.

0:46:15.400 --> 0:46:18.000
I am innocent. I am innocent!

0:46:19.233 --> 0:46:21.466
Someone must have tricked Ertugrul Bey.

0:46:22.833 --> 0:46:25.233
If you don't tell me where my Turgut is...

0:46:25.933 --> 0:46:27.533
...I will kill you here.

0:46:28.700 --> 0:46:32.800
They are not touching you as you are
a woman, they are not torturing you...

0:46:33.566 --> 0:46:36.366
...but you cannot deceive me
with this naive woman act.

0:46:36.800 --> 0:46:39.966
You lowlife,
you will regret the day you were born.

0:46:41.233 --> 0:46:45.266
Now tell me where the hideout of these
spineless creatures called Templars is.

0:46:47.800 --> 0:46:48.866
Tell me!

0:46:54.333 --> 0:46:55.900
Why don't you understand?

0:46:57.300 --> 0:47:01.333
I am just a mere servant.
How can I know where their hideout...

0:47:02.566 --> 0:47:05.400
If I knew, for the life of your brave...

0:47:05.566 --> 0:47:09.766
Do not put my brave's name on your tongue
either, tell me where Turgut is!

0:47:10.466 --> 0:47:12.466
Tell me, tell me!

0:47:13.900 --> 0:47:16.933
All I know is... All I know...

0:47:18.700 --> 0:47:21.700
They do very bad things
to the enemies they capture.

0:47:23.600 --> 0:47:28.700
They pluck their meat out while alive
and feed them to the dogs and ravens.

0:47:29.366 --> 0:47:31.466
And throw the rest into bugs.

0:47:31.866 --> 0:47:35.633
Not only for myself,
I shall pray for your brave as well.

0:47:36.266 --> 0:47:39.766
I pray to God that he is not
a prisoner of them. I pray to God!

0:47:42.400 --> 0:47:44.366
You are lying! You are lying!

0:47:44.800 --> 0:47:46.966
-I'm going to kill you! Kill you!
-Aykiz!

0:47:47.233 --> 0:47:50.266
-Aykiz! Aykiz! Aykiz!
-Tell me! I am going to kill you!

0:47:50.366 --> 0:47:52.500
-Come here!
-You are going to die!

0:47:52.666 --> 0:47:54.400
-Enough!
-I am going to kill you!

0:47:54.566 --> 0:47:57.366
While you die,
you will wish that I do it fast!

0:47:57.500 --> 0:47:59.833
-Come here! Come on!
-Leave me alone, father!

0:48:02.333 --> 0:48:03.766
Let me go! Let go!

0:48:05.300 --> 0:48:08.533
Know that I will be your Azrael!
Know it well!

0:48:40.366 --> 0:48:42.966
<i>I wanted you to see the beauty</i>
 <i>that I am seeing.</i>

0:49:39.566 --> 0:49:41.900
Is there something
you are hiding from me, father?

0:49:46.500 --> 0:49:47.666
Is it...

0:49:48.566 --> 0:49:49.633
...Yigit?

0:49:49.800 --> 0:49:54.433
No, no. I am only thinking
how I can save your brother.

0:49:55.933 --> 0:49:57.000
That is all.

0:51:06.333 --> 0:51:08.600
Did we enter a Mongol tribe
without knowing?

0:51:08.966 --> 0:51:12.766
What is this?
Nobody looks at us and give a reaction.

0:51:13.933 --> 0:51:16.800
They probably forgot us
as we have been away for so long.

0:52:01.900 --> 0:52:03.266
Ertugrul?

0:52:18.766 --> 0:52:20.466
Welcome to your new home.

0:52:21.300 --> 0:52:22.500
Thank you, father.

0:52:26.866 --> 0:52:29.866
-Welcome, brother.
-Thank you, brother. Thank you.

0:52:50.400 --> 0:52:51.633
Welcome, my son.

0:53:03.633 --> 0:53:07.366
When you were in the mountains
all alone to become an Alp...

0:53:08.666 --> 0:53:10.700
...when you fought with the Mongols...

0:53:11.833 --> 0:53:14.866
...or when you were swinging
your sword against the Crusaders...

0:53:15.000 --> 0:53:16.600
...I was never afraid.

0:53:20.433 --> 0:53:21.866
But Aleppo is different.

0:53:26.666 --> 0:53:28.300
I saw the betrayal there.

0:53:30.766 --> 0:53:35.400
I was very scared that they would take you
away from me, not with their swords...

0:53:36.466 --> 0:53:38.800
...but with their treacheries.

0:53:42.666 --> 0:53:44.766
Thank God you have returned, my son.

0:53:53.266 --> 0:53:55.600
Betrayal is not only
inside Aleppo, mother.

0:54:07.466 --> 0:54:10.966
Some people killed our Alps
and falsely accused me.

0:54:13.600 --> 0:54:15.300
Who is that person, father?

0:54:18.200 --> 0:54:19.366
Kurdoglu.

0:54:21.966 --> 0:54:23.900
I told him to rethink his words.

0:54:25.266 --> 0:54:27.600
We shall ask him today
in the headquarter meeting.

0:54:28.233 --> 0:54:30.733
Let us see whether he is insistent
on his claim.

0:54:30.900 --> 0:54:34.333
Even if he is,
let him say it directly to your face.

0:54:35.233 --> 0:54:36.300
Bey...

0:54:36.433 --> 0:54:40.566
...Kurdoglu said what he said. Those
ominous words spilled from his mouth.

0:54:42.366 --> 0:54:46.366
-Ertugrul, get out now!
-How dare you come to the tribe!

0:54:47.833 --> 0:54:52.000
-You shall pay for what you did!
-Come out and face us!

0:55:09.466 --> 0:55:10.633
Ertugrul!

0:55:14.366 --> 0:55:15.933
This is my problem, father.

0:55:24.233 --> 0:55:25.400
Rahman...

0:55:26.666 --> 0:55:29.233
...allow them to come in.
-As you wish, Bey!

0:55:37.433 --> 0:55:40.200
How could you spill
the blood of your brothers, Ertugrul?

0:55:40.300 --> 0:55:43.333
-Where are our braves?
-Our sons are gone!

0:55:45.833 --> 0:55:48.933
Where are our lions?
Why did you kill our Alps, Bey?

0:56:02.966 --> 0:56:04.466
I heard that...

0:56:05.466 --> 0:56:08.500
...someone presumptuous has put
a smear on our foreheads.

0:56:09.833 --> 0:56:14.700
As if this was not enough,
with false witnesses and fake evidence...

0:56:14.866 --> 0:56:17.233
...he added more lies to his lies!

0:56:18.333 --> 0:56:21.833
If he was not aware of what he said,
the sin is on him.

0:56:23.833 --> 0:56:25.200
But...

0:56:25.966 --> 0:56:28.300
...if he was slandering on purpose...

0:56:29.700 --> 0:56:31.266
...a day will come...

0:56:31.766 --> 0:56:34.266
...where his throat would meet my hand.

0:56:46.666 --> 0:56:48.266
What is the claim?

0:56:50.266 --> 0:56:53.766
That I killed the Alps whom I fought side
by side against the pagan Mongols...

0:56:53.933 --> 0:56:55.833
...and the infidel Crusaders.

0:56:56.933 --> 0:56:58.200
And what for?

0:57:00.733 --> 0:57:01.900
For nothing.

0:57:05.633 --> 0:57:08.533
Slander makes a brave hard.

0:57:09.700 --> 0:57:11.400
It strengthens his faith.

0:57:13.833 --> 0:57:14.966
But...

0:57:15.733 --> 0:57:18.366
...for some brothers
believing this slander...

0:57:18.700 --> 0:57:20.866
...is what really hurts my heart.

0:57:21.766 --> 0:57:24.733
And that hurt does not go away.

0:57:27.766 --> 0:57:29.000
The truth is that...

0:57:30.433 --> 0:57:32.600
...God is Great...

0:57:33.733 --> 0:57:35.433
...and The Sole Avenger.

0:57:54.800 --> 0:57:57.833
If there is still someone
who believes that this slander is true...

0:58:01.466 --> 0:58:03.300
...he can pick up my sword...

0:58:04.700 --> 0:58:07.200
...and cut off my head right here and now.

0:58:12.266 --> 0:58:13.800
I would not even move a hair.

0:58:24.800 --> 0:58:28.933
Instead of breathing the same air and
stepping on the same ground with them...

0:58:29.233 --> 0:58:30.833
...I would prefer to die.

0:58:32.300 --> 0:58:34.766
And my blood is halal to them.

1:00:16.700 --> 1:00:18.300
Well done, Titus.

1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:22.433
If you succeed in this...

1:00:23.533 --> 1:00:25.300
What does Titus say, sir?

1:00:30.266 --> 1:00:36.733
He wrote that it is time to make Ayubis
and the Seljuk fight with each other.

1:00:39.233 --> 1:00:40.766
El Aziz and Halime.

1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:46.200
He invited us to their wedding
that shall last 40 days and 40 nights.

1:00:48.633 --> 1:00:50.233
Did you find that spy?

1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:52.966
There is no way out for him.

1:00:53.333 --> 1:00:56.600
Sooner or later, he shall get out of
the rat hole he hides in.

1:01:19.466 --> 1:01:24.800
In the 99 names of our Great God,
Who creates with only saying “let be”...

1:01:24.966 --> 1:01:26.800
...Who fills our hearts with faith.

1:01:26.900 --> 1:01:30.200
In the name of God, most Merciful
and most Graceful. Please...

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.366
While I was laying on my sickbed...

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:34.766
...the unity and solidarity
of our tribe was damaged.

1:02:36.266 --> 1:02:39.866
It is so sorrowful that
on one side my sons...

1:02:41.866 --> 1:02:43.733
...on the other side my blood brother...

1:02:44.900 --> 1:02:47.333
...accused each other in my marquee.

1:02:49.533 --> 1:02:52.266
When dark clouds gathered
above our tribe...

1:02:52.966 --> 1:02:55.666
...instead of standing straight
and keeping silent...

1:02:56.333 --> 1:02:59.200
...they started arguing like women!

1:03:02.500 --> 1:03:06.533
My son Ertugrul was accused of killing
the Alps of our tribe.

1:03:07.733 --> 1:03:09.200
What nonsense is this?

1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:13.700
First, I would like to solve this matter.

1:03:15.433 --> 1:03:16.633
Tell us, Kurdoglu.

1:03:17.866 --> 1:03:23.300
Bey, we are thankful to God as you have
recovered and leading us once again.

1:03:24.966 --> 1:03:28.366
While you were fighting for your life
in those hard days...

1:03:29.300 --> 1:03:34.500
...your son Gundogdu,
broke the rule you have set...

1:03:35.833 --> 1:03:37.900
...and sent Ertugrul to Aleppo.

1:03:38.933 --> 1:03:42.900
As I did not want
your rule to be overruled...

1:03:43.833 --> 1:03:45.866
...I sent some men after Ertugrul.

1:03:47.766 --> 1:03:49.733
And they were all slaughtered.

1:03:50.433 --> 1:03:52.566
And I thought it was Ertugrul's doing.

1:03:53.433 --> 1:03:57.900
But, when I personally went to see
our martyrs with my own eyes...

1:03:59.866 --> 1:04:02.700
...I saw that they were killed
by the Crusaders.

1:04:09.300 --> 1:04:10.733
And this...

1:04:12.266 --> 1:04:13.700
...is the evidence.

1:04:24.533 --> 1:04:25.633
Gundogdu.

1:04:26.466 --> 1:04:27.666
Bey...

1:04:28.433 --> 1:04:30.333
...your situation was critical.

1:04:31.900 --> 1:04:34.266
Someone had to lead the tribe.

1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:39.466
I put my trust on the dream you saw
and sent my brother to Aleppo.

1:04:40.433 --> 1:04:41.666
The rest is known.

1:04:42.766 --> 1:04:46.633
We had to deal with
the false accusations of our Emmi.

1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:53.000
My words are the last words in this tribe!

1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:56.666
No one can say a word on top of me!

1:04:57.733 --> 1:05:00.900
No order can be given over my order!
Let this be known!

1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:11.300
How can one be accused without thinking
twice and without evidence, Kurdoglu?

1:05:16.533 --> 1:05:19.466
If my time comes to an end
in this mortal world...

1:05:19.700 --> 1:05:21.933
...what will you turn this tribe into?

1:05:25.933 --> 1:05:28.366
I am forgiving you for one last time.

1:05:29.433 --> 1:05:32.700
From now on,
if you act against the tradition...

1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:35.766
...you will not have a tribe to sleep in.

1:05:40.966 --> 1:05:42.966
Now, let us hear you out, Ertugrul.

1:05:43.300 --> 1:05:46.000
Tell us. What is the situation?

1:05:50.266 --> 1:05:54.300
There is a price to pay in drinking water
from the poisonous well called Aleppo.

1:05:55.200 --> 1:05:58.366
And we shall pay
more than what it is worth.

1:06:00.266 --> 1:06:01.400
But...

1:06:01.900 --> 1:06:04.433
...if we do not clean this
poisonous water...

1:06:05.266 --> 1:06:08.400
...the Muslim world will be
swept into a catastrophe.

1:06:09.833 --> 1:06:12.500
The Crusaders are preparing
for a new campaign.

1:06:12.700 --> 1:06:17.900
That is why the Templars are trying to
clear the road to Jerusalem.

1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:25.233
They try to eliminate the Beys, tribes
and statesmen whom they see as a threat.

1:06:27.233 --> 1:06:29.833
We must clean Aleppo at all costs.

1:06:32.200 --> 1:06:34.300
What does your tongue say, Ertugrul?

1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:38.566
Are we to solve the problem
of great big Muslim world?

1:06:38.766 --> 1:06:41.566
While we can't even find
a quarter to spend the winter...

1:06:41.700 --> 1:06:43.933
...you talk to us about cleaning Aleppo.

1:06:45.566 --> 1:06:48.766
If the cries of the oppressed
would fill the skies...

1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:54.266
...if everything that is sacred to us,
our tradition, language, religion...

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:58.866
...our homeland,
will be trampled upon by the tyrants...

1:07:00.300 --> 1:07:03.533
...what is the point of having
a wintering quarter or not?

1:07:06.500 --> 1:07:10.366
I saw that, us coming to these lands
is not without purpose.

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:16.766
We will either live, without letting
the tyrants crush these lands...

1:07:17.466 --> 1:07:22.533
...or be erased from history if we bow our
heads like cowards in front of the tyrant.

1:07:27.466 --> 1:07:29.333
That is the situation, father.

1:07:29.533 --> 1:07:30.966
What should we do then?

1:07:33.300 --> 1:07:35.333
Our brother Turgut is imprisoned.

1:07:35.833 --> 1:07:38.633
Aleppo is worse than imprisonment.

1:07:40.300 --> 1:07:45.833
We have to make a will, gird our swords
and clean both of these worlds of tyranny.

1:07:49.333 --> 1:07:50.600
That is the situation.

1:07:52.233 --> 1:07:53.900
Ertugrul speaks of the truth.

1:08:06.333 --> 1:08:10.433
From now on, our swords shall be
ready for battle at all times.

1:08:12.333 --> 1:08:15.600
We shall take a thousand lives
of those who take one life from us!

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:19.366
That is my final word.

1:09:43.766 --> 1:09:45.933
-Turgut Agabey.
-Yigit.

1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:49.233
We will save you from here.

1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:51.300
I know, Yigit. I know.

1:09:52.966 --> 1:09:55.000
Now listen to what I have to say.

1:09:59.633 --> 1:10:02.500
-You know the niece of Ustad?
-You mean Isadora?

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:07.333
You have to tell her what I tell you.
It is very important.

1:10:09.500 --> 1:10:11.566
Child, get away from there.

1:10:12.533 --> 1:10:14.266
Tell her that she is right.

1:10:14.833 --> 1:10:17.400
The man in the dungeon is her father.

1:10:17.766 --> 1:10:20.200
I said get away from there!
Go and take him away.

1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:23.833
He became a Muslim and
took the name of Omar.

1:10:26.666 --> 1:10:28.333
She has to help both of us.

1:10:30.366 --> 1:10:31.800
Do you understand, Yigit?

1:10:32.766 --> 1:10:36.333
His highness the prince should go inside
if he wishes not to be beaten up.

1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.400
What did you think
you were doing, my girl?

1:11:23.900 --> 1:11:27.966
Do you know what Ertugrul risked
to kidnap that woman out of the palace?

1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:30.500
What if she died?

1:11:31.400 --> 1:11:35.366
Who goes in the front stays in Damascus,
those who go in the back stay in an inn.

1:11:35.566 --> 1:11:37.800
That woman sees this place like an inn.

1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:42.433
You don't beat her up because
you are men, you are brave.

1:11:43.566 --> 1:11:46.633
You treat this lowlife woman
like a royalty.

1:11:47.633 --> 1:11:49.766
I know the language she would understand.

1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:51.733
Let me do what is needed.

1:11:52.433 --> 1:11:55.566
Stop right there.
Alright, you got your wild side from me.

1:11:55.733 --> 1:11:58.300
But, you should have gotten
the patience of your mother.

1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:00.200
Ertugrul Bey is back.

1:12:01.333 --> 1:12:04.700
We will see what will happen.
The situation is very complicated.

1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:11.566
He will of course find a way to save
Turgut from that castle.

1:12:12.666 --> 1:12:16.500
Father, how do you know that
my Turgut still lives?

1:12:18.533 --> 1:12:21.600
That they didn't throw him in
a ditch after killing him?

1:12:21.933 --> 1:12:25.333
How do you know that they didn't
let him rot in that ditch?

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:27.533
Do we have permission?

1:12:27.800 --> 1:12:28.900
Come in, Bey.

1:12:38.233 --> 1:12:39.600
Turgut is alive, Aykiz.

1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:43.900
If Turgut is there,
why are you here, son of a Bey?

1:12:44.233 --> 1:12:46.966
Does it suit a brave to sit
in his tent like a nesting bird?

1:12:47.233 --> 1:12:49.500
-Aykiz!
-Don't stop me, father.

1:12:50.833 --> 1:12:54.333
Let me say him a few words,
maybe I can knock some sense into him.

1:12:54.433 --> 1:12:56.766
-I said Aykiz!
-Wild Demir...

1:12:59.866 --> 1:13:02.566
...let her spill the beans
she has been holding inside.

1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:07.333
Did you forget my Turgut
just so that you can go after Halime?

1:13:09.933 --> 1:13:13.866
You can deduce a good meat in a plate,
a brave in a war...

1:13:14.566 --> 1:13:16.633
...and a friend from their advice.

1:13:21.933 --> 1:13:23.766
If Turgut is still alive...

1:13:24.633 --> 1:13:26.233
...I would bring him back.

1:13:26.966 --> 1:13:29.666
If he is dead...

1:13:31.233 --> 1:13:32.666
...I would make them pay.

1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:36.866
But...

1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:40.466
...I would not a shed a tear
after a martyr.

1:13:40.900 --> 1:13:42.566
Let this be known, Aykiz.

1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:48.233
If you ask me why
I haven't made them pay yet...

1:13:49.233 --> 1:13:52.433
...the answer lies in the woman
you tried to strangle last night.

1:13:54.666 --> 1:13:58.966
The matter is not about entering
the devil's den, it is about finding it.

1:14:01.366 --> 1:14:03.233
My problem is finding that den.

1:14:08.233 --> 1:14:09.400
Turgut...

1:14:10.866 --> 1:14:13.266
...is a part of me,
even more than my heart.

1:14:13.933 --> 1:14:15.400
Let this be known.

1:14:19.233 --> 1:14:21.533
If my brave is alive, bringing him back...

1:14:21.766 --> 1:14:24.966
...if he is dead, putting him in a grave
is your debt to me.

1:14:27.466 --> 1:14:30.666
I sent you to death so many times
as if it were a celebration.

1:14:30.833 --> 1:14:32.833
I entrusted my Turgut into you.

1:14:33.933 --> 1:14:37.800
If you rot the flesh of my Turgut
in the lands of the infidels...

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:42.733
...my hands would be on your neck
in this world and beyond, Ertugrul Bey.

1:14:42.866 --> 1:14:44.600
And you let this be known.

1:14:53.183 --> 1:14:54.316
My apologies my Bey.

1:14:55.150 --> 1:14:58.183
Seeing you safe and sound
is more than enough for me.

1:15:03.350 --> 1:15:04.350
Have seat.

1:15:22.216 --> 1:15:24.249
I've never felt
this kind of difficulty in my life.

1:15:25.616 --> 1:15:29.283
I'd know what to do if I were faced with
40 wars, 40,000 enemies...

1:15:29.983 --> 1:15:31.150
...but this is different.

1:15:39.883 --> 1:15:40.950
Look my daughter.

1:15:42.083 --> 1:15:45.950
You should continue this game
with Yigit, till I get some help.

1:15:48.283 --> 1:15:51.116
I should go and explain
everything to Ertugrul Bey.

1:15:52.283 --> 1:15:54.050
Our salvation is with Kayis.

1:15:56.016 --> 1:15:59.050
It is no longer possible
to move forward in the castle.

1:15:59.116 --> 1:16:00.350
Are you going to escape?

1:16:02.650 --> 1:16:04.016
What about my brother Turgut?

1:16:05.250 --> 1:16:07.150
-They are going to kill him.
-Hush.

1:16:09.283 --> 1:16:11.316
This is obligatory my Shahzade.

1:16:12.916 --> 1:16:16.216
I must leave this bloody place
and get some help immediately.

1:16:37.350 --> 1:16:40.150
Would there be the new without the old,
and the good without the bad?

1:16:40.983 --> 1:16:44.950
Is it only Ertugrul
that caused us all the trouble?

1:16:47.050 --> 1:16:49.916
Did you not see how arrogant
he was when he entered the tent?

1:16:51.050 --> 1:16:53.150
Placing a sword in the middle of otak,

1:16:53.216 --> 1:16:54.583
saying “cut my head off”...

1:16:56.116 --> 1:17:01.416
Your brother has become
the bastard of the system.

1:17:01.483 --> 1:17:04.150
The bad he does is seen as if he did good.

1:17:04.950 --> 1:17:07.183
Oh for god's sake, enough Hatun!

1:17:12.116 --> 1:17:14.516
When I look at you I see a sluggish man...

1:17:15.650 --> 1:17:17.950
...as naive as a man can be.

1:17:18.016 --> 1:17:20.150
Hatun, what do you want from me?

1:17:20.216 --> 1:17:21.216
What is bothering you?

1:17:22.116 --> 1:17:25.150
I see the fog on a mountain,
a snake in sight Gundogdu.

1:17:27.150 --> 1:17:30.016
Your brother Ertugrul,
whom you love dearly...

1:17:30.083 --> 1:17:34.950
...is on your back like a scorpion and
ready to sting when he is done with you.

1:17:35.016 --> 1:17:38.550
When will you realise?
These are all Seigniory games.

1:17:38.616 --> 1:17:40.350
Enough! Enough!

1:17:41.283 --> 1:17:43.150
I am sick of your Seigniory games.

1:17:44.383 --> 1:17:46.616
You talk like
you do not know Oguz customs.

1:17:47.450 --> 1:17:50.283
The person who will become
the Bey is the one who deserves it.

1:17:50.350 --> 1:17:52.983
If I deserve I will,
if Ertugrul does, he will.

1:17:53.450 --> 1:17:54.850
That is it.

1:17:56.150 --> 1:17:59.016
My only concern is to get
this nomad group out of trouble.

1:18:01.383 --> 1:18:03.550
Your only concern should be
giving birth to your child.

1:18:40.850 --> 1:18:41.983
Sister.

1:18:45.083 --> 1:18:46.650
Gundogdu Bey was furious.

1:18:47.550 --> 1:18:48.850
What happened?

1:18:51.850 --> 1:18:53.883
He is just an incongruous coward.

1:19:00.983 --> 1:19:01.983
Gokce...

1:19:02.483 --> 1:19:05.850
...in order to obtain what is ours,
you must go to bed with Ertugrul.

1:19:07.450 --> 1:19:09.083
Sister, what are you talking about?

1:19:09.150 --> 1:19:10.583
I know what I am talking about.

1:19:11.950 --> 1:19:15.950
Before Ertugrul leaves,
you will do what you have to do.

1:19:17.516 --> 1:19:18.516
But first...

1:19:19.183 --> 1:19:20.950
...my beautiful and foolish sister...

1:19:22.183 --> 1:19:23.950
...be a woman. A woman.

1:19:25.616 --> 1:19:27.250
Do you understand what I say?

1:19:28.350 --> 1:19:30.416
Be a woman, and take your man.

1:19:33.016 --> 1:19:35.350
Otherwise you will rot
in this nomad group.

1:19:35.416 --> 1:19:39.216
-Sister...
-I said go Gokce. Go, go!

1:20:09.050 --> 1:20:11.116
Hush.

1:20:11.850 --> 1:20:13.416
Hush.

1:20:28.950 --> 1:20:33.983
<i>I will pray for my Han</i>

1:20:35.550 --> 1:20:42.350
<i>For that, the black mountains</i>
 <i>Shall not collapse</i>

1:20:43.850 --> 1:20:50.283
<i>The tree of shadows shall not be cut</i>

1:20:51.450 --> 1:20:58.450
<i>The beautiful river of blood</i>
 <i>Shall not dry</i>

1:21:01.183 --> 1:21:08.183
<i>The tip of your wings</i>
 <i>Shall not break</i>

1:21:10.616 --> 1:21:17.616
<i>Your destiny</i>
 <i>Shall not put you in despair</i>

1:21:20.316 --> 1:21:27.316
<i>Your white horse's legs</i>
 <i>Shall not sprain</i>

1:21:51.450 --> 1:21:52.450
My Bey.

1:21:53.216 --> 1:21:55.416
They are going to the tent
to force that woman to speak.

1:21:56.283 --> 1:21:57.283
So...

1:21:57.983 --> 1:22:01.016
...we should find a way to visit
the Templar's castle, Alpargo.

1:22:02.016 --> 1:22:04.116
They are our neighbors now, aren't they?

1:22:04.916 --> 1:22:08.083
There is a saying:
“Neighbors need each other's ashes.”

1:22:15.016 --> 1:22:17.116
If you are planning
to be a bitch like Baybora...

1:22:17.183 --> 1:22:18.550
...just tell me so that we know.

1:22:21.183 --> 1:22:24.850
If you are going to show the white
feather, just leave me alone now.

1:22:24.916 --> 1:22:26.283
Leave and herd your goats.

1:22:26.983 --> 1:22:29.616
We are on our way my Bey.
We always keep our promises.

1:22:31.250 --> 1:22:32.450
You'd better Alpargo.

1:22:34.116 --> 1:22:35.383
You'd better.

1:23:07.283 --> 1:23:08.283
Ertugrul?

1:23:09.416 --> 1:23:11.416
You are surprised to see me, aren't you?

1:23:14.350 --> 1:23:17.083
Thank God I have seen you
safe and sound my Bey.

1:23:17.550 --> 1:23:20.183
You are the only one
who can save me from this disgrace.

1:23:21.016 --> 1:23:24.083
What a coincidence,
I thought the same thing for you.

1:23:26.016 --> 1:23:27.383
Don't do this, my Bey.

1:23:29.216 --> 1:23:31.216
How could you think like that about me?

1:23:33.483 --> 1:23:35.183
I am just an ordinary odalisque.

1:23:36.250 --> 1:23:37.983
It is the same talk since this morning.

1:23:38.950 --> 1:23:40.183
She didn't say anything else.

1:23:40.850 --> 1:23:43.616
If you weren't a woman,
I'd know how to make you speak.

1:23:45.250 --> 1:23:48.083
You made so many
sacrifices to catch her...

1:23:49.583 --> 1:23:51.483
...bu she did not speak Ertugrul Bey.

1:23:59.083 --> 1:24:00.383
Ertugrul.

1:24:30.983 --> 1:24:33.616
All those years you have
been looking into my eyes...

1:24:34.350 --> 1:24:35.950
...and betraying me?

1:24:42.216 --> 1:24:44.216
Ata Bey, we need her alive.

1:24:59.350 --> 1:25:01.350
Did you think we would allow you...

1:25:03.083 --> 1:25:07.216
...to come from the steppes of Asia
and settle down in our holy land?

1:25:09.350 --> 1:25:11.483
We won't stop until
we bury you in the desert...

1:25:11.550 --> 1:25:13.450
...like all the other Muslims on earth.

1:25:15.950 --> 1:25:17.416
You, horde of bastards!

1:25:18.083 --> 1:25:19.550
You will all die!

1:25:28.516 --> 1:25:29.583
Do not worry.

1:25:31.016 --> 1:25:32.616
I will make her speak, sooner or later.

1:25:35.416 --> 1:25:37.983
Even if it requires me
to cut my own tongue with my teeth...

1:25:38.883 --> 1:25:40.183
...I would do it...

1:25:40.250 --> 1:25:42.383
...but you will not hear a word from me.

1:25:44.216 --> 1:25:46.050
You are not going to
make me speak Ertugrul.

1:26:38.416 --> 1:26:39.583
O God!

1:26:53.516 --> 1:26:54.916
O God!

1:26:56.416 --> 1:26:58.650
Staying in Aleppo did you no good Bamsi.

1:26:58.883 --> 1:27:00.016
You forgot how to fight.

1:27:00.083 --> 1:27:05.350
So you think you can
beat Bamsi with moves like that?

1:27:06.450 --> 1:27:09.116
You big head Bamsi, big head Bamsi!

1:27:15.250 --> 1:27:16.983
The heroes are feeling alive.

1:27:19.516 --> 1:27:21.116
Go on Bamsi!

1:27:22.583 --> 1:27:23.850
Come on Hamza.

1:27:23.916 --> 1:27:25.416
Knock that big head Bamsi down!

1:27:28.416 --> 1:27:30.150
God is one and only, Bamsi!

1:27:53.083 --> 1:27:55.283
It was me who first suggested
going to Aleppo first.

1:27:58.050 --> 1:28:01.083
I went mad when my father
told me you were going.

1:28:04.283 --> 1:28:05.416
You should have seen me.

1:28:07.050 --> 1:28:10.016
I felt like a child
who stole his older brother's toys.

1:28:13.483 --> 1:28:14.516
But now I know...

1:28:15.916 --> 1:28:18.383
...my father's dream came true.

1:28:19.350 --> 1:28:20.516
Thank god.

1:28:22.050 --> 1:28:25.416
Perhaps none of these would have happened
if you were the one to go to Aleppo.

1:28:27.150 --> 1:28:28.650
None of us will ever know this Ertugrul.

1:28:30.516 --> 1:28:32.616
But there is something that I am sure of.

1:28:32.850 --> 1:28:36.050
Whatever the cost is, we must find
a way to remain at this heavenly land.

1:28:37.183 --> 1:28:39.150
Otherwise the Kayi Tribe won't survive.

1:28:40.583 --> 1:28:41.650
They would exterminate us.

1:28:43.616 --> 1:28:46.150
The only place
we can go is the desert after all.

1:28:47.350 --> 1:28:50.116
Neither our animals nor us
can survive in the desert.

1:28:51.550 --> 1:28:54.583
So, we need to
find a way to get over these...

1:28:55.516 --> 1:28:57.450
...what the hell
they are called, the Templars.

1:29:05.550 --> 1:29:08.550
This land will never
be truly ours, brother.

1:29:11.216 --> 1:29:15.483
We will not find peace
until we establish...

1:29:15.550 --> 1:29:17.850
...our own state on our own land.

1:29:22.083 --> 1:29:26.550
So as soon as possible, we must
give these Templar's game away...

1:29:26.616 --> 1:29:29.583
...which works against not only us
but also the whole Muslim world.

1:29:31.116 --> 1:29:32.283
How will it be possible?

1:29:44.250 --> 1:29:49.083
For the sake of Ucler,
Yediler, Kirklar my poet...

1:29:50.383 --> 1:29:55.350
...tell us about our peer Ahmed Yesevi
so that all our hearts could warm.

1:29:56.916 --> 1:30:00.250
So that we can feel our holy prophet...

1:30:01.550 --> 1:30:03.850
<i>...may God honor him</i>
 <i>and grant him peace...</i>

1:30:05.550 --> 1:30:07.316
...is with us.

1:30:20.316 --> 1:30:26.183
<i>As I am burning with</i>

1:30:26.883 --> 1:30:33.883
<i>The love of Muhammad</i>

1:30:35.550 --> 1:30:42.383
<i>I am madly deeply following</i>

1:30:44.183 --> 1:30:51.183
<i>The path of Muhammad</i>

1:30:53.550 --> 1:30:59.383
<i>As I am burning with the love of</i>
Muhammad

1:30:59.983 --> 1:31:04.983
<i>I am madly deeply following</i>
 <i>the path of Muhammad</i>

1:31:06.250 --> 1:31:12.016
<i>All the Islamic ummah is thankful</i>

1:31:12.083 --> 1:31:17.250
<i>And praising Muhammad</i>

1:31:22.950 --> 1:31:28.550
<i>I pray endlessly to God the almighty</i>

1:31:28.616 --> 1:31:33.950
<i>For there shall be no love</i>
 <i>in my heart other than Muhammad's</i>

1:31:34.416 --> 1:31:39.483
<i>As I am burning with the love of</i>
Muhammad

1:31:40.216 --> 1:31:46.250
<i>I am madly deeply following</i>
 <i>the path of Muhammad</i>

1:31:56.916 --> 1:32:02.383
<i>I choose to be possessed</i>

1:32:02.450 --> 1:32:07.416
<i>By madness for Muhammad</i>

1:32:13.516 --> 1:32:19.250
<i>And I, Yesevi the sluggard</i>

1:32:19.316 --> 1:32:24.450
<i>Beg for mercy from Muhammad</i>

1:32:25.116 --> 1:32:30.050
<i>As I am burning with the love of</i>
Muhammad

1:32:30.616 --> 1:32:36.483
<i>I am madly deeply following</i>
 <i>the path of Muhammad</i>

1:32:36.550 --> 1:32:41.616
<i>As I am burning with the love of</i>
Muhammad

1:32:42.350 --> 1:32:49.350
<i>I am madly deeply following</i>
 <i>the path of Muhammad</i>

1:33:39.350 --> 1:33:40.416
Ertugrul.

1:34:00.550 --> 1:34:01.883
Halime.

1:34:04.916 --> 1:34:06.083
Ertugrul.

1:34:09.916 --> 1:34:10.916
I'd like to talk to you.

1:34:12.450 --> 1:34:13.616
I am listening Gokce.

1:34:22.850 --> 1:34:26.016
I am not sure if my words would be
appropriate on these hard days...

1:34:27.483 --> 1:34:29.950
...but our sorrow gets deeper
since we both are quiet.

1:34:33.516 --> 1:34:35.116
-I...
-Ertugrul.

1:34:37.116 --> 1:34:40.916
If you excuse me, I just
want you to listen to me.

1:34:47.016 --> 1:34:49.016
Neihter your parents' decision...

1:34:50.183 --> 1:34:52.350
...nor anything else I care about.

1:34:54.183 --> 1:34:55.983
There is something I want you to know.

1:34:59.150 --> 1:35:01.316
I have been in love
with you since I was a child.

1:35:06.450 --> 1:35:08.550
All my life, I have always loved you.

1:35:10.950 --> 1:35:13.350
You can say it is
a foolish or childish thing.

1:35:15.183 --> 1:35:16.183
But it is what it is.

1:35:23.150 --> 1:35:24.283
I will not...

1:35:25.116 --> 1:35:30.116
...let Halime or anybody take away
this beautiful pain within me.

1:35:34.383 --> 1:35:36.950
If necessary, I will
wait for you till the day I die.

1:35:39.483 --> 1:35:42.550
While your heart is burning with
the dream of that Shahzade's daughter...

1:35:44.083 --> 1:35:45.916
...my heart will be burning here with you.

1:35:48.316 --> 1:35:49.616
This is my reality.

1:35:52.550 --> 1:35:54.916
And I will not let
anybody take it from me.

1:36:00.116 --> 1:36:03.550
I don’t want you to feel sorry or pity me.

1:36:06.450 --> 1:36:08.383
I just wanted you to know all about it.

1:36:11.250 --> 1:36:12.250
That is it.

1:37:22.183 --> 1:37:24.183
May I come in Sister Gokce?

1:37:26.416 --> 1:37:27.416
Come in Aga.

1:37:40.616 --> 1:37:43.450
I don't know if I should be happy or sad.

1:37:46.150 --> 1:37:48.616
You and Ertugrul
grew up together before my eyes.

1:37:50.850 --> 1:37:52.616
While I was bringing two hearts up...

1:37:53.383 --> 1:37:55.150
...I wasn't aware they were bitter.

1:38:00.583 --> 1:38:01.583
I...

1:38:03.283 --> 1:38:06.416
...have always loved
Ertugrul all my life long.

1:38:09.950 --> 1:38:11.316
I was loving him...

1:38:13.616 --> 1:38:18.250
...even when my father's blood was all
around the otak because of Suleyman Shah.

1:38:23.116 --> 1:38:26.016
I loved him even I knew
he was not so keen on me.

1:38:28.450 --> 1:38:30.116
He did not even notice me.

1:38:33.183 --> 1:38:35.316
I was worthless than his horse's tail.

1:38:37.850 --> 1:38:38.850
Even though, I loved him.

1:38:42.616 --> 1:38:46.250
I loved him till that girl,
he did not even know or recognize arrived.

1:38:55.216 --> 1:38:57.316
It is fine that
you don’t love him anymore.

1:39:02.850 --> 1:39:03.850
I wish it was so.

1:39:08.016 --> 1:39:10.883
Now, I am hurt each and every other day.

1:39:18.116 --> 1:39:20.083
Woe, my heartsore Sister.

1:40:55.350 --> 1:40:57.883
The bastards you were protecting
came here to kill you.

1:40:57.950 --> 1:40:59.483
Will you go on protecting them?

1:41:09.516 --> 1:41:11.316
Since it is a war they are after...

1:41:14.016 --> 1:41:15.416
...they will get what they want.

1:41:18.650 --> 1:41:20.650
Since they want to exterminate us...

1:41:22.850 --> 1:41:24.983
...we will fight till we all die.

1:42:54.116 --> 1:42:55.216
Tell me Bamsi...

1:42:56.616 --> 1:42:58.350
...where do know this man from?

1:42:59.383 --> 1:43:00.550
Your memory is impressive!

1:43:01.183 --> 1:43:04.216
Remember, we were
chatting with Ibn'ul Arabi...

1:43:04.283 --> 1:43:06.883
...and then this merchant
came, he sat with us.

1:43:07.850 --> 1:43:11.083
Aha! He came when Ibn'ul Arabi
was talking about the devil.

1:43:53.283 --> 1:43:54.916
Peace be upon you.

1:43:54.983 --> 1:43:56.216
And peace be upon you.

1:44:01.883 --> 1:44:03.483
I am looking for a man named Kurdoglu.

1:44:04.250 --> 1:44:06.216
Would you tell me where he is, Blacksmith?

1:44:08.250 --> 1:44:12.583
I would but you might
curse me when you find him.

1:44:13.350 --> 1:44:14.350
Excuse me?

1:44:15.250 --> 1:44:16.850
I am not good at your language.

1:44:17.283 --> 1:44:19.183
It is okay, you needn't understand.

1:44:19.250 --> 1:44:21.983
You see that tent? He is over there.

1:44:24.250 --> 1:44:25.483
Thanks.

1:44:51.116 --> 1:44:53.083
I was wondering where you have been.

1:44:54.083 --> 1:44:56.550
So, now we are like neighbors.

1:44:57.850 --> 1:44:59.516
So I came to say welcome.

1:45:00.483 --> 1:45:02.216
Welcome to you also, Titus.

1:45:03.516 --> 1:45:05.083
Ebu Hisham.

1:45:07.016 --> 1:45:09.550
Your presence is
a pleasure for us Ebu Hisham.

1:45:18.416 --> 1:45:20.016
We completed all the arrangements.

1:45:20.083 --> 1:45:24.350
The Alps are positioned
around the nomad group.

1:45:27.383 --> 1:45:30.983
Rahman, they sneaked
in the nomad group twice.

1:45:32.316 --> 1:45:33.516
They spread the plague.

1:45:34.316 --> 1:45:35.983
This became a miserable place.

1:45:36.850 --> 1:45:39.250
If they sneak in for the third time...

1:45:39.950 --> 1:45:44.416
...I will hand not only you
but also all the guards..

1:45:45.116 --> 1:45:49.183
...over to the Reaper myself.
Do you hear me?

1:46:03.650 --> 1:46:05.283
May we come in my Bey?

1:46:13.150 --> 1:46:19.283
My Bey, I brought you the most honorable
merchant of Aleppo, Ebu Hisham.

1:46:26.916 --> 1:46:30.016
He is welcomed here.

1:46:32.050 --> 1:46:35.483
But when did you get to know the
honorable merchants of Aleppo, Kurdoglu?

1:46:36.150 --> 1:46:39.316
My Bey, while you were
busy dealing with the troubles...

1:46:39.383 --> 1:46:42.250
...Ebu Hisham came
to visit our nomad group.

1:46:43.250 --> 1:46:46.183
It was a difficult journey,
but you have arrived here safe and sound.

1:46:47.050 --> 1:46:48.850
Your presence is a blessing for this land.

1:46:50.350 --> 1:46:52.550
Thank you, Merchant. Thank you!

1:46:53.550 --> 1:46:57.050
The souks of Aleppo will be very
lively with the goods of your nomad group.

1:46:57.483 --> 1:47:02.183
My desire is to work togetger
to give joy to your souks and Aleppo.

1:47:26.950 --> 1:47:31.483
We wanted to visit you in Aleppo,
but we could not find any traces of you.

1:47:35.550 --> 1:47:38.150
I was away for finding
new goods for a long time.

1:47:39.583 --> 1:47:43.083
You shared your bread with me.
I can never forget your good fellowship.

1:48:27.516 --> 1:48:29.383
We are the heralds of the Ameer of Aleppo.

1:48:29.983 --> 1:48:31.983
We have come to talk with Suleyman Shah.

1:48:44.416 --> 1:48:46.450
Heralds have come from Aleppo, my Bey!

1:48:49.150 --> 1:48:50.350
Let them in.

1:49:09.550 --> 1:49:11.250
May I have your permission to leave?

1:49:43.583 --> 1:49:44.583
Come on, Commander.

1:49:49.550 --> 1:49:53.416
We have come to inform you about the order
of his highness Ameer of Aleppo El Aziz.

1:49:54.150 --> 1:49:55.150
I am listening to you.

1:50:12.516 --> 1:50:14.450
“I order you to leave...

1:50:14.516 --> 1:50:18.150
...this land, which you have occupied
through craft and force, in three days.

1:50:18.216 --> 1:50:20.650
Otherwise, you should know that my army...

1:50:20.883 --> 1:50:24.450
...will slaughter you all
with their swords, Suleyman Shah.

1:50:26.150 --> 1:50:27.283
This is my last warning.”

1:50:43.250 --> 1:50:45.450
I suppose there is someone
important in that tent.

1:50:45.516 --> 1:50:47.450
An dangerous woman is staying in it.

1:50:59.650 --> 1:51:01.883
How many soldiers
does he have in his army?

1:51:02.883 --> 1:51:06.350
Even the number of his palace guards are
over than the number of our men, father.

1:51:11.883 --> 1:51:14.416
Praise to God, we are like in heaven.

1:51:15.416 --> 1:51:18.116
The Templars at night,
El Aziz in the morning.

1:51:22.150 --> 1:51:24.516
We must find a way to convince El Aziz.

1:51:27.283 --> 1:51:31.650
My Bey, I learned that my brother's
nomad group is in the Seljuk border.

1:51:32.616 --> 1:51:34.850
We can ask for help from him.

1:51:35.583 --> 1:51:37.950
You know, he would give his life to you.

1:51:39.183 --> 1:51:40.183
I know.

1:51:41.850 --> 1:51:42.916
He would do it.

1:51:44.250 --> 1:51:48.516
He would also come
with his soldiers but this is our war.

1:51:50.016 --> 1:51:51.283
We must find another solution.

1:51:52.316 --> 1:51:54.583
We must solve this matter
without shedding any blood.

1:51:56.850 --> 1:51:57.850
There is a way, father.

1:52:01.516 --> 1:52:03.016
Thank you.

1:52:03.083 --> 1:52:04.450
Enjoy it Ertugrul Bey.

1:52:07.950 --> 1:52:09.450
I am going to visit El Aziz.

1:52:14.650 --> 1:52:16.850
Are you aware of what you just said, son?

1:52:17.950 --> 1:52:19.016
I am aware, father.

1:52:21.216 --> 1:52:23.083
I am going to bring
one of our guests with me.

1:52:25.183 --> 1:52:28.283
The Templar's spy, who he thinks
is an odalisque in the palace.

1:52:29.383 --> 1:52:31.583
Are you going to take Esma to the palace?

1:52:33.416 --> 1:52:35.450
She can not deny the tattoo on her nape.

1:52:37.216 --> 1:52:40.216
If we can manage to
take her to the palace soundly...

1:52:40.983 --> 1:52:43.050
...we will be able to give
the Templar's game away.

1:53:07.050 --> 1:53:11.016
My Bey, while we were trying
to get rid of Kara Toygar trouble...

1:53:11.450 --> 1:53:12.983
...we bumped into Nasir trouble.

1:53:13.616 --> 1:53:15.983
Unless we kill
Suleyman Shah and his sons...

1:53:16.483 --> 1:53:18.950
...God knows what other
troubles we will bump into.

1:53:19.450 --> 1:53:21.083
So what are we going to do, my Bey?

1:53:21.150 --> 1:53:23.116
We will do what needs to be done, Alpargo.

1:53:26.283 --> 1:53:28.050
What ever needs to be done.

1:53:42.916 --> 1:53:46.916
Finally you have
the courage to confront me, huh?

1:53:47.850 --> 1:53:51.850
You used that sorcerer whore
called Yiva to kill my baby, Kurdoglu.

1:53:51.916 --> 1:53:53.216
And then, you killed Yiva.

1:53:53.916 --> 1:53:56.383
She deserved to die, just like you do.

1:53:58.516 --> 1:54:00.616
You broke our deal, Selcan Hatun.

1:54:01.950 --> 1:54:07.616
When I went to kill Suleyman Shah,
you sent your husband after to kill me.

1:54:09.450 --> 1:54:11.383
You'd kill two birds with one stone.

1:54:12.850 --> 1:54:14.983
I did not realize how inept you are.

1:54:19.116 --> 1:54:23.116
Anyway, as your baby is still alive...

1:54:25.116 --> 1:54:27.383
...we are not that late to make peace.

1:54:33.450 --> 1:54:37.216
Yes, if we collaborate...

1:54:37.283 --> 1:54:38.416
What do you want from me?

1:54:39.350 --> 1:54:42.150
I want my father's revenge
to be taken, Kurdoglu.

1:54:44.283 --> 1:54:47.283
I was also there
when your father's blood...

1:54:47.350 --> 1:54:49.416
...was dripping all around
from Suleyman's sword.

1:54:49.483 --> 1:54:51.516
I did everything to stop him.

1:54:52.250 --> 1:54:55.083
But Suleyman is a ruthless man.

1:54:59.316 --> 1:55:02.083
Your father was more
than a brother to me, Selcan.

1:55:03.083 --> 1:55:05.483
So, you will do
what needs to be done, Kurdoglu.

1:55:05.550 --> 1:55:06.983
What about Gundogdu?

1:55:08.216 --> 1:55:10.483
We will also talk about it
when the right time comes.

1:55:10.550 --> 1:55:12.550
Now, you have a task to complete.

1:55:13.316 --> 1:55:17.216
An important task which you have
to complete without messing up.

1:55:19.116 --> 1:55:23.916
Ertugrul is going to Aleppo,
and he is taking that woman with him.

1:55:25.916 --> 1:55:26.983
Where are they going to?

1:55:28.050 --> 1:55:29.183
To the palace.

1:55:53.433 --> 1:55:55.500
I am coming with you to Aleppo.

1:55:59.933 --> 1:56:01.133
Brother.

1:56:02.133 --> 1:56:04.566
At least one person should stay
in the nomad group with our father.

1:56:06.166 --> 1:56:08.400
If we can not take
that woman there soundly...

1:56:09.433 --> 1:56:14.000
...we will no longer have
a father or a nomad group to return.

1:56:23.933 --> 1:56:27.866
As soon as I finish this task,
I will be going to the Templar’s castle.

1:56:29.800 --> 1:56:32.000
Do you know what
you are talking about, son?

1:56:36.333 --> 1:56:37.933
If Turgut is alive...

1:56:40.466 --> 1:56:42.033
...I must bring him back.

1:56:48.366 --> 1:56:49.466
But if not...

1:56:51.266 --> 1:56:53.266
...if he is dead...

1:56:55.233 --> 1:56:56.833
...I must take his revenge.

1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:06.800
It is not that easy to go in there.

1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:09.500
Let’s say you got in. You can't go out.

1:57:23.600 --> 1:57:27.200
I request that you write
a short letter to those bastards.

1:57:29.866 --> 1:57:32.100
It is not decent to drop by
without letting them know.

1:57:33.533 --> 1:57:35.100
They should know that I am coming...

1:57:35.966 --> 1:57:37.800
...in order to make
necessary preparations.

1:57:46.333 --> 1:57:49.233
The good guest
is the one who informs first.

1:58:48.066 --> 1:58:50.300
These are the best textiles I have seen.

1:58:51.500 --> 1:58:55.200
It has been years
since I saw colors as vibrant as these.

1:58:56.966 --> 1:58:59.066
Especially these rugs and carpets...

1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:01.466
<i>God bless.</i>

1:59:02.966 --> 1:59:05.600
Actually I wasn't expecting
them to be this good, Mother Hayme.

1:59:06.433 --> 1:59:07.600
Thank you, Ebu Hisham.

1:59:09.300 --> 1:59:13.800
It is the same technique that our
ancestors used throughout the centuries.

1:59:13.866 --> 1:59:15.800
Without changing it, without any cheats.

1:59:18.533 --> 1:59:21.500
That is why you have
a good reputation where ever you go.

1:59:22.500 --> 1:59:26.066
Although I heard that things
did not go so well for you in Aleppo.

1:59:30.100 --> 1:59:31.600
I have just arrived from Aleppo.

1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:36.400
Everybody is talking about
the things a Kayi Bey’s son did.

1:59:37.566 --> 1:59:39.533
He delved among the entire city.

1:59:46.033 --> 1:59:50.366
Anyway, let’s get to business.
Those things do not concern me.

1:59:55.266 --> 1:59:57.566
You certainly deserve the price you asked.

1:59:58.933 --> 2:00:00.800
It is the reward of your labor.

2:00:02.066 --> 2:00:06.466
However, the famine affected everybody.

2:00:08.333 --> 2:00:09.866
If you excuse me...

2:00:12.100 --> 2:00:13.866
...this is the last amount remaining.

2:00:20.033 --> 2:00:21.300
If you accept...

2:00:22.566 --> 2:00:28.333
...we can have a deal today
for 640 gold coins, not for 800.

2:00:32.900 --> 2:00:35.533
Although Suleyman Shah sent you to me...

2:00:36.933 --> 2:00:38.400
...I must consult our Bey.

2:00:40.933 --> 2:00:42.000
Peace be upon you.

2:00:42.533 --> 2:00:43.533
And peace be upon you.

2:00:44.133 --> 2:00:45.133
Peace be upon you.

2:00:45.933 --> 2:00:49.433
Ebu Hisham, if you excuse me,
I will take you to our Bey.

2:00:50.333 --> 2:00:52.966
You can deliberate
this subject with him too.

2:00:54.433 --> 2:00:55.466
Let’s go.

2:01:08.166 --> 2:01:11.400
-I have good news for you, Titus.
-I am listening to you Kurdoglu.

2:01:11.466 --> 2:01:14.600
Ertugrul is going on a journey
with his Alps tomorrow.

2:01:15.900 --> 2:01:17.333
Where are they going to?

2:01:18.366 --> 2:01:20.566
The woman who works for you,
what was her name...

2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:21.800
...Esma.

2:01:22.866 --> 2:01:24.933
They are going to take her
to Aleppo, to El Aziz.

2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:47.566
Did something happen, uncle?

2:02:49.966 --> 2:02:52.900
We are going to have a guest soon.

2:02:58.166 --> 2:03:00.200
So, come on Ertugrul.

2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:03.833
I’m waiting for you to come.

2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:45.266
<i>The Master should know that Eftelya</i>
 <i>is being taken to Aleppo by Ertugrul.</i>

2:04:47.866 --> 2:04:50.133
When will you tell me
the things hidden inside you?

2:04:52.800 --> 2:04:55.833
Is not, what we both gone
through for days, enough?

2:04:55.900 --> 2:04:57.300
I beg you to talk to me, father.

2:05:03.233 --> 2:05:04.233
Halime.

2:05:07.300 --> 2:05:10.500
El Aziz told me that
he wanted you as his wife.

2:05:16.100 --> 2:05:17.300
What are you saying, father?

2:05:19.866 --> 2:05:22.533
I decided that this is
the right thing for all of us.

2:05:36.033 --> 2:05:38.866
This is the first time
I am asking something from you.

2:05:40.966 --> 2:05:42.966
You must accept this proposal...

2:05:44.200 --> 2:05:47.233
...not only for yourself but also
for the goodness of your brother.

2:06:32.500 --> 2:06:33.500
Gundogdu.

2:06:36.833 --> 2:06:38.066
Where are you going?

2:06:39.433 --> 2:06:40.833
To Aleppo.

2:06:42.300 --> 2:06:45.300
-Ertugrul was supposed to go.
-We decided to go together.

2:06:48.200 --> 2:06:49.200
No way!

2:06:51.433 --> 2:06:53.400
I can’t let you leave nomad group.

2:06:54.333 --> 2:06:57.066
Our Bey has regained his health, Hatun.

2:06:57.133 --> 2:07:00.366
The matter is not your father,
it is Ertugrul.

2:07:01.500 --> 2:07:03.333
What did Ertugrul do again?

2:07:04.333 --> 2:07:07.200
He is a sinister man,
who brings trouble to where ever he goes.

2:07:07.266 --> 2:07:09.433
He will also cause you
unexpected troubles.

2:07:09.500 --> 2:07:13.066
-I do not want you to go with him.
-All right, enough!

2:07:15.033 --> 2:07:16.833
I am fed up with your sickly behavior.

2:07:17.366 --> 2:07:19.100
I beg you, please do not go.

2:07:19.166 --> 2:07:22.133
You can never know what
will happen if you follow him.

2:07:23.166 --> 2:07:25.900
Gundogdu, I beg you.

2:07:28.033 --> 2:07:29.566
Do not leave me alone with my baby.

2:07:31.600 --> 2:07:33.100
Do not do this to us.

2:07:34.800 --> 2:07:35.900
I beg you, please.

2:07:42.033 --> 2:07:43.033
Hatun.

2:07:45.433 --> 2:07:51.100
I have to go for you,
for our baby, for our nomad group.

2:07:52.566 --> 2:07:54.166
I can’t leave Ertugrul alone.

2:07:55.400 --> 2:07:57.000
No.

2:07:57.066 --> 2:08:01.200
I don’t want you to go.
I beg you, do not go.

2:08:01.800 --> 2:08:04.866
Please don’t leave us alone.
Don’t go please.

2:08:04.933 --> 2:08:06.300
Hatun, enough!

2:08:06.933 --> 2:08:09.966
You can’t go!
I say, you can’t go, Gundogdu!

2:08:10.033 --> 2:08:12.500
Gundogdu, stop.
You can’t go, I beg you!

2:08:12.566 --> 2:08:14.400
-Let go of me!
-No, Gundogdu!

2:08:14.466 --> 2:08:17.433
Let go of me Selcan! Hatun!

2:08:17.500 --> 2:08:21.433
I beg you, don’t go!
Please don’t go, Gundogdu!

2:12:56.533 --> 2:12:57.866
Selcan?

2:12:58.800 --> 2:12:59.833
Father.

2:13:01.233 --> 2:13:02.233
Father.

2:13:05.333 --> 2:13:06.466
Father.

2:13:08.466 --> 2:13:09.966
Father.

2:13:12.333 --> 2:13:15.966
I beg you father, do not let Gundogdu go.

2:13:16.933 --> 2:13:18.533
Stop them, I beg you.

2:13:21.533 --> 2:13:23.300
Selcan, what happened?

2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:29.566
No, you can’t let them, father.
You can’t let them go.

2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:32.600
Do not let Gundogdu march on to die!

2:13:36.933 --> 2:13:40.100
Selcan, what is all this muttering about?

2:13:43.400 --> 2:13:45.500
Is there something
you know but can’t tell?

2:13:48.300 --> 2:13:49.300
Just say it.

2:13:50.100 --> 2:13:53.066
Is there something that you know,
something you heard or you suspect?

2:13:54.933 --> 2:13:55.933
Father.

2:13:56.966 --> 2:13:57.966
Speak I say!

2:13:59.133 --> 2:14:00.466
Speak!

2:14:00.533 --> 2:14:03.166
You annoyed me and now you are silent.

2:14:04.900 --> 2:14:06.166
Tell me what is bothering you?

2:14:07.400 --> 2:14:08.400
Speak!

2:14:08.833 --> 2:14:10.100
What happened to my sons?
